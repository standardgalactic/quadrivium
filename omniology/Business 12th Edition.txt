Dear Business Students:
How do you define success? For some, success is a high-paying job, promotions, and  
financial security. For others, success is finding a rewarding balance between work and 
personal time. Regardless of how you define success or what your personal goals are, we 
wrote this text with one purpose: to help you succeed in today’s competitive business world.
As authors, we believe that success is measured not only by the grade you receive at the 
end of the semester, but also by how you use the information and concepts in this text to 
build a foundation for a better life. It is important to begin reading this text with one thing in 
mind. This business course doesn’t have to be difficult. In fact, learning about business and 
how you can become successful can be fun. To help you succeed, this edition of Business is 
packed with updated content and information that can help you not only get a better grade, 
but also help you reach your personal goals and enjoy a successful life.
We worked hard to make sure there is something in every chapter to help you understand 
the world of business and become a better employee, a more informed consumer, and, if it is 
your dream—a successful business owner. All new boxed features help reinforce the success 
theme, including Career Success, Ethical Success or Failure, Entrepreneurial Success, and 
Going for Success. You can also use the chapter summary, review and discussion questions, 
and case problems to reinforce important concepts. And the activities in the Building Skills for 
Career Success section will help to improve the skills you need for success.
We are especially proud of the CourseMate Web site that accompanies the text. The Web 
site contains more student learning activities and an eBook—all designed to help you 
experience success. For those who want even more state-of-the-art technology, there are other 
online solutions that accompany this text, including MindTap and CengageNOW. A number 
of learning activities—all designed to help you to experience success—are available at  
CengageBrain.com. There you will find:
    • Interactive quizzes 
    • Student PowerPoint slides
    • Links to videos
    • Chapter audio reviews 
    • Games and crossword puzzles
    • Interactive flashcards
We invite you to examine the visual guide that follows to see how Pride/Hughes/Kapoor can 
help you learn about business and enjoy success in not only your career, but also your life.
Sincerely
Bill Pride

Zynga Zooms into Business
Zynga, named for its founder’s American bulldog, is the fast-growing business behind 
some of the social media world’s fastest-growing games. If you’ve ever tended crops on 
FarmVille, you know how addictive a Zynga game can be. Even though FarmVille was devel-
oped and launched in only six weeks, it instantly captured the imagination of millions of 
players who eagerly logged onto their Facebook accounts to plant trees or exchange seeds 
with “neighbors.” Other popular Zynga games include CityVille, CastleVille, and Words 
with Friends.
Founder and CEO Mark Pincus is a seasoned entrepreneur who earned an MBA from 
Harvard University. Before Zynga, he had started four other Internet businesses—and 
earned millions of dollars from their success. In 2007, he came up with the idea for a game 
business in which players could get ahead by connecting with friends (think “neighbors” 
in FarmVille) and buying special items (such as virtual tractors and cows) that would give 
them a competitive edge. 
Now, when players worldwide buy digital tractors and cows in FarmVille, they can pay 
with real money, which is why Zynga’s profits are real. So real, in fact, that on the basis 
of its track record, Zynga was able to go public and sell shares of its corporate stock in 
December, 2011. 
As Zynga continues to grow, Pincus and his managers are keeping their workforce 
satisfied by offering benefits such as surprise vacations and by making the workplace as 
comfortable as possible. Like many other high-tech firms, Zynga offers free lunch and din-
ner. Dogs are welcome at the San Francisco headquarters (and they get free dog nibbles, 
too). Employees can grab a cup of fresh-brewed espresso at the office’s gourmet coffee 
station, sip tea in the Zen-style tea garden, work out in the fitness center, or take a break 
to play arcade games in the company lounge. 
In today’s fast-paced business environment, the online games that get everyone talk-
ing and clicking right now can become has-beens as soon as the next new thing comes to 
market. That’s why Pincus and his entire team are working hard to keep Zynga zooming 
ahead year after year.1
W
ow! What a challenging world we live in. Just for a moment, think about 
the economic problems listed here and how they affect not only you, but 
also businesses in the United States and the global economy. 
●
●U.S. unemployment rates hovering around 8 percent
●
●Reduced spending by worried consumers 
●
●Increased government spending to stimulate a troubled economy that created the 
largest national debt in the nation’s history
●
●A volatile stock market and concerns about banks and financial institutions
●
●Reform movements including the “Occupy Wall Street” movement that protest 
differences in wealth and income
In fact, just about every person around the globe was affected in some way by the 
economic crisis that began in late 2007. Despite the efforts of the U.S. government 
and other world governments to provide the economic stimulus needed to stabilize 
the economy, it took nearly four years before the economy began to improve. Today, 
even with signs of modest improvement, people still worry about their economic 
FYI
Did You Know? 
Zynga’s CityVille game is the 
fastest-growing online game in 
history, attracting more than  
84 million players within its first 
month of release on Facebook.

Part 1   The Environment of Business

business in which individuals are 
free to decide what to produce, 
how to produce it, and at what 
price to sell it
future and the future of the nation. Hopefully, by the time you read this material, 
the nation’s economy will be much stronger. Still, it is important to remember the old 
adage, “History is a great teacher.” Both the nation and individuals should take a look 
at what went wrong to avoid making the same mistakes in the future. 
In addition, it helps to keep one factor in mind: Our economy continues to adapt 
and change to meet the challenges of an ever-changing world and to provide oppor-
tunities for those who want to achieve success. Our economic system provides an 
amazing amount of freedom that allows businesses like Zynga—the Internet gaming 
company profiled in the Inside Business opening case for this chapter—to adapt to 
changing business environments. Despite troubling economic times and a weak econ-
omy, Zynga—and its 3,000 employees—is a success because it was able to introduce 
new games that players love, earn a profit, and sell stock to the general public. 
Within certain limits, imposed mainly to ensure public safety, the owners of a 
business can produce any legal good or service they choose and attempt to sell it at 
the price they set. This system of business, in which individuals decide what to pro-
duce, how to produce it, and at what price to sell it, is called free enterprise. Our 
­free-enterprise system ensures, for example, that Amazon.com can sell everything from 
televisions, toys, and tools to computers, cameras, and clothing. Our system gives 
Amazon’s owners and stockholders the right to make a profit from the company’s suc-
cess. It gives Amazon’s management the right to compete with bookstore rival Barnes 
& Noble and electronics giant Sony. It also gives you the right to choose.
In this chapter, we look briefly at what business is and how it became that way. 
First, we discuss what you must do to be successful in the world of business and 
explore some important reasons for studying business. Then we define business, not-
ing how business organizations satisfy their customers’ needs and earn profits. Next, 
we examine how capitalism and command economies answer four basic economic 
questions. Then our focus shifts to how the nations of the world measure economic 
performance, the phases in a typical business cycle, and the four types of competitive 
situations. Next, we look at the events that helped shape today’s business system, the 
current business environment, and the challenges that businesses face.
Your Future in the Changing 
World of Business
The key word in this heading is changing. When faced with both economic problems 
and increasing competition not only from firms in the United States but also from 
international firms located in other parts of the world, employees and managers began 
to ask the question: What do we do now? Although this is a fair question, it is difficult 
to answer. Certainly, for a college student taking business courses or an employee 
just starting a career, the question is even more difficult to answer. Yet there are still 
opportunities out there for people who are willing to work hard, continue to learn, and 
possess the ability to adapt to change. Let’s begin our discussion in this section with 
three basic concepts.
●
●What do you want?
●
●Why do you want it?
●
●Write it down! 
During a segment on a national television talk show, Joe Dudley, one of the 
world’s most respected black business owners, gave the preceding advice to anyone 
who wanted to succeed in business. His advice can help you achieve success. What is 
so amazing about Dudley’s success is that he started a manufacturing business in his 
own kitchen, with his wife and children serving as the new firm’s only employees. He 
went on to develop his own line of hair-care and cosmetic products sold directly to 
cosmetologists, barbers, beauty schools, and consumers in the United States and 18 
foreign countries. Today, Mr. Dudley has a multimillion-dollar empire—one of the

most successful minority-owned companies in the nation. He is not only a successful 
business owner but also a winner of the Horatio Alger Award—an award given to 
outstanding individuals who have succeeded in the face of adversity.2 
Although many people would say that Joe Dudley was just lucky or happened to 
be in the right place at the right time, the truth is that he became a success because he 
had a dream and worked hard to turn his dream into a reality. Today, Dudley’s vision 
is to see people succeed—to realize “The American Dream.” He would be the first to 
tell you that you have the same opportunities that he had. According to Mr. Dudley, 
“Success is a journey, not just a destination.”3
Whether you want to obtain part-time employment to pay college and living 
expenses, begin your career as a full-time employee, or start a business, you must bring 
something to the table that makes you different from the next person. Employers and 
our economic system are more demanding than ever before. Ask yourself: What can 
I do that will make employers want to pay me a salary? What skills do I have that 
employers need? With these two questions in mind, we begin the next section with 
another basic question: Why study business?
Why Study Business?
The potential benefits of higher education are enormous. To begin with, there are 
economic benefits. Over their lifetimes, college graduates on average earn much more 
than high school graduates. Although lifetime earnings are substantially higher for 
college graduates, so are annual income amounts (see Figure 1.1). In addition to higher 
income, you will find at least five compelling reasons for studying business.
For Help in Choosing a Career  What do you want to do with the rest of your 
life? At some time in your life, someone probably has asked you this same ques-
tion. Like many people, you may find it a difficult question to answer. This business 
course will introduce you to a wide array of employment opportunities. In private 
enterprise, these range from small, local businesses owned by one individual to large 
companies such as American Express and Marriott International that are owned by 
thousands of stockholders. There are also employment opportunities with federal, 
state, county, and local governments and with charitable organizations such as the 
Red Cross and Save the Children. For help in deciding which career might be right 
for you, read Appendix A: Careers in Business, which appears on the text Web site.

In addition to career information in Appendix A, a number of additional Web 
sites provide information about career development. For more information, visit the 
following sites:
●
●Career Builder at www.careerbuilder.com
●
●Career One Stop at www.careeronestop.org
●
●Monster at www.monster.com
To click your career into high gear, you can also use online networking to advance 
your career. Web sites like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other social media sites 
can help you locate job openings, help prospective employers to find you, and make a 
good impression on current and future bosses. To make the most of online networking, 
begin by identifying and joining sites where you can connect with potential employers, 
former classmates, and others who may have or may hear of job openings. Next, be 
sure your online profiles, photographs, and posts communicate your abilities and inter-
est without being offensive or overly revealing. Finally, be ready to respond quickly 
when you spot a job opening. 
One thing to remember as you think about what your ideal career might be is that 
a person’s choice of a career ultimately is just a reflection of what he or she values and 
holds most important. What will give one individual personal satisfaction may not sat-
isfy another. For example, one person may dream of a career as a corporate executive 
and becoming a millionaire before the age of 30. Another may choose a career that has 
more modest monetary rewards but that provides the opportunity to help others. What 
you choose to do with your life will be based on what you feel is most important. And 
you are a very important part of that decision.
To Be a Successful Employee  Deciding on the type of career you want is only the 
first step. To get a job in your chosen field and to be successful at it, you will have to  
develop a plan, or a road map, that ensures that you have the skills and knowledge  
the job requires. You will also be expected to have the ability to work well with many 
types of people in a culturally diverse workforce. Cultural (or workplace) diversity 
refers to the differences among people in a workforce owing to race, ethnicity, and

Show Off Your Skills with Digital Merit Badges 
Made of pixels instead of fabric, the next 
generation of merit badges is on its way, 
bringing new possibilities for showing off 
your skills via digital badges on your Web site, 
blog, or Facebook page. The point is to encourage students, 
career-changers, veterans, and learners of all ages to acquire 
or polish skills that can be helpful in career moves and in life. 
Whether you’re just entering the workforce or you want to 
branch out into a new field, take a look at what digital merit 
badges have to offer. 
The MacArthur Foundation is partnering with organizations 
such as the Smithsonian and the U.S. Department of Veterans 
Affairs to encourage and recognize skill attainment in a variety 
of areas through its “Badges for Lifelong Learning” program. 
In the works are badges for financial literacy, engineering 
design, filmmaking, mathematics proficiency, natural history, 
and military experience. “The badges are another way to tell 
the story of who you are and what you know,” explains a 
MacArthur executive. 
TopCoder, a Connecticut company, awards digital badges 
(and cash) to those who earn top scores in its international 
programming competitions. NASA has teamed up with the 
Boy Scouts of America and the Girl Scouts of America to offer 
badges in robotics. Is a digital merit badge in your future?

gender. These skills, together with a working knowl-
edge of the American business system and an apprecia-
tion for a culturally diverse workplace, can give you an 
inside edge when you are interviewing with a prospec-
tive employer.
This course, your instructor, and all of the resources 
available at your college or university can help you to 
acquire the skills and knowledge you will need for a 
successful career. But do not underestimate your part 
in making your dream a reality. In addition to the job-
related skills and knowledge you’ll need to be successful in a 
specific job, employers will also look for the following charac-
teristics when hiring a new employee or promoting an existing 
employee:
●
●Honesty and integrity
●
●Willingness to work hard
●
●Dependability
●
●Time management skills
●
●Self-confidence
●
●Motivation
●
●Willingness to learn
●
●Communication skills
●
●Professionalism 
Employers will also be interested in any work experience 
you may have had in cooperative work/school programs, dur-
ing summer vacations, or in part-time jobs during the school 
year. These things can make a difference when it is time to 
apply for the job you really want.
To Improve Your Management Skills  Often, employees become managers or 
supervisors. In fact, many employees want to become managers because managers 
often receive higher salaries. Although management obviously can be a rewarding 
career, what is not so obvious is the amount of time and hard work needed to achieve 
the higher salaries. For starters, employers expect more from managers and supervi-
sors than ever before. Typically, the heavy workload requires that managers work long 
hours, and most do not get paid overtime. They also face increased problems created 
by the economic crisis, increased competition, employee downsizing, the quest for 
improved quality, and the need for efficient use of the firm’s resources.
To be an effective manager, managers must be able to perform four basic man-
agement functions: planning, organizing, leading and motivating, and controlling. All 
four topics are discussed in Chapter 6, Understanding the Management Process. To 
successfully perform these management functions, managers must possess four very 
important skills.
●
●Interpersonal skills—The ability to deal effectively with individual employees, 
other managers within the firm, and people outside the firm.
●
●Analytic skills—The ability to identify problems correctly, generate reasonable 
alternatives, and select the “best” alternatives to solve problems.
●
●Technical skills—The skill required to accomplish a specific kind of work being 
done in an organization. Although managers may not actually perform the techni-
cal tasks, they should be able to train employees and answer technical questions.
●
●Conceptual skills—The ability to think in abstract terms in order to see the “big 
picture.” Conceptual skills help managers understand how the various parts of an 
organization or idea can fit together.

Sometimes you have to reach for success!  There’s an 
old saying that if you choose a career you like, you never 
have to work a day in your life. For most people, the first 
decision is choosing a career. Then the material in the 
sections “To Be a Successful Employee” and “To Improve 
Your Management Skills” can help you achieve success.

Part 1   The Environment of Business
In addition to the four skills just described, a successful manager will need many 
of the same characteristics that an employee needs to be successful. 
To Start Your Own Business  Some people prefer to work for themselves, and they 
open their own businesses. To be successful, business owners must possess many of the 
same characteristics that successful employees have, and they must be willing to work 
hard and put in long hours.
It also helps if your small business can provide a product or service that custom-
ers want. For example, Steve Demeter, the CEO and founder of the software develop-
ment firm Demiforce, began his career by creating the Trism application for the Apple 
iPhone. Trism was an immediate sensation and sold 50,000 copies at $4.99 in its first 
two months on Apple’s AppStore. Now Demeter and the employees at Demiforce are 
working with a number of promising ideas in the works all with one goal in mind: to 
provide games and applications that people want.4
Unfortunately, many small-business firms fail: Approximately 70 percent of them 
fail within the first ten years. Typical reasons for business failures include undercapi-
talization (not enough money), poor business location, poor customer service, unquali-
fied or untrained employees, fraud, lack of a proper business plan, and failure to seek 
outside professional help. The material in Chapter 5, Small Business, Entrepreneurship, 
and Franchises, and selected topics and examples throughout this text will help you to 
decide whether you want to open your own business. This material will also help you 
to overcome many of these problems.
To Become a Better Informed Consumer and Investor  The world of business 
surrounds us. You cannot buy a home, a new Ford Fusion Hybrid from the local Ford 
dealer, a pair of jeans at Gap Inc., or a hot dog from a street vendor without entering a 
business transaction. Because you no doubt will engage in business transactions almost 
every day of your life, one very good reason for studying business is to become a more 
fully informed consumer. 
Many people also rely on a basic understanding of business to help them to invest 
for the future. According to Julie Stav, Hispanic stockbroker-turned-author/radio per-
sonality, “Take $25, add to it drive plus determination and then watch it multiply 
into an empire.”5 The author of Get Your Share believes that it is important to learn 
the basics about the economy and business, stocks, mutual funds, and other alterna-
tives before investing your money. She also believes that it is never too early to start 
investing. Although this is an obvious conclusion, just dreaming of being rich does not 
make it happen. In fact, like many facets of life, it takes planning and determination 
to establish the type of investment program that will help you to accomplish your 
financial goals.

Seven Ways to Use this Text and Its Resources
1.  Prepare before you 
go to class.
Early preparation is the key to success in many of life’s activities. Certainly, early preparation can 
help you to participate in class, ask questions, and improve your performance on examinations.
2.  Read the chapter.
Although it may seem like an obvious suggestion, many students never take the time to really  
read the material. Find a quiet space where there are no distractions, and invest enough time  
to become a “content expert.”
3.  Underline or 
highlight important 
concepts.
Make this text yours. Do not be afraid to write on the pages of your text or highlight important 
material. It is much easier to review material if you have identified important concepts.
4.  Take notes.
While reading, take the time to jot down important points and summarize concepts in your own 
words. Also, take notes in class.
5.  Apply the concepts.
Learning is always easier if you can apply the content to your real-life situation. Think about how 
you could use the material either now or in the future.
6.  Practice critical 
thinking.
Test the material in the text. Do the concepts make sense? To build critical-thinking skills, answer 
the questions that accompany the cases at the end of each chapter. Also, many of the exercises in 
the Building Skills for Career Success require critical thinking.
7.  Prepare for the 
examinations.
Allow enough time to review the material before the examinations. Check out the summary and 
review questions at the end of the chapter. Then use the resources on the text Web site.

Business: A Definition
Business is the organized effort of individuals to produce and sell, for a profit, the 
goods and services that satisfy society’s needs. The general term business refers to 
all such efforts within a society (as in “American business”). However, a business is 
a particular organization, such as Kraft Foods, Inc., or Cracker Barrel Old Country 
Stores. To be successful, a business must perform three activities. It must be organized, 
it must satisfy needs, and it must earn a profit.
The Organized Effort of Individuals
For a business to be organized, it must combine four kinds of resources: material, 
human, financial, and informational. Material resources include the raw materials 
used in manufacturing processes as well as buildings and machinery. For example, 
Sara Lee (now part of Hillshire Brands) needs flour, sugar, butter, eggs, and other 
raw materials to produce the food products it sells worldwide. In addition, this 
Illinois-based company needs human, financial, and informational resources. Human 
resources are the people who furnish their labor to the business in return for wages. 
The financial resource is the money required to pay employees, purchase materials, 
and generally keep the business operating. Information is the resource that tells 
the managers of the business how effectively the other three resources are being 
combined and used (see Figure 1.2).
Today, businesses are usually organized as one of three specific 
types. Service businesses produce services, such as haircuts, legal 
advice, or tax preparation. H&R Block provides tax preparation, 
retail banking, and various business advisory and consulting ser-
vices in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Manufacturing 
businesses process various materials into tangible goods, such as 
delivery trucks, towels, or computers. Intel, for example, produces 
computer chips that, in turn, are sold to companies that manufac-
ture computers. Finally, some firms called marketing intermediar-
ies buy products from manufacturers and then resell them. Sony 
Corporation is a manufacturer that produces stereo equipment, 
televisions, and other electronic products. These products may be 
sold to a marketing intermediary such as Best Buy or Walmart, 
which then resells the manufactured goods to consumers in their 
retail stores.
Satisfying Needs
The ultimate objective of every firm must be to satisfy the needs 
of its customers. People generally do not buy goods and services 
simply to own them; they buy goods and services to satisfy

Organization when it counts. Imagine what would 
happen if the medical professionals in a hospital 
operating room weren’t organized—especially if you 
were the patient. Like a surgical operating room, a 
business must be organized in order to meet the needs 
of its customers and earn a profit.

particular needs. Some of us may feel that the need for transportation is best satisfied 
by an air-conditioned BMW with navigation system, stereo system, heated and cooled 
seats, automatic transmission, power windows, and remote-control side mirrors. 
Others may believe that a Chevrolet Sonic with a stick shift will do just fine. Both 
products are available to those who want them, along with a wide variety of other 
products that satisfy the need for transportation.
When firms lose sight of their customers’ needs, they are likely to find the going 
rough. However, when businesses understand their customers’ needs and work to 
satisfy those needs, they are usually successful. Back in 1962, Sam Walton opened his 
first discount store in Rogers, Arkansas. Although the original store was quite differ-
ent from the Walmart Superstores you see today, the basic ideas of providing customer 
service and offering goods that satisfied needs at low prices are part of the reason why 
this firm has grown to become the largest retailer in the world. Although Walmart has 
over 10,000 stores in the United States and 27 other countries, this highly successful 
discount-store organization continues to open new stores to meet the needs of its cus-
tomers around the globe.6
Business Profit
A business receives money (sales revenue) from its customers in exchange for goods or 
services. It must also pay out money to cover the expenses involved in doing business. 
If the firm’s sales revenues are greater than its expenses, it has earned a profit. More 
specifically, as shown in Figure 1.3, profit is what remains after all business expenses 
have been deducted from sales revenue.
A negative profit, which results when a firm’s expenses are greater than its 
sales revenue, is called a loss. A business cannot continue to operate at a loss for 
an indefinite period of time. Management and employees must find some way 
to increase sales revenues and reduce expenses to return to profitability. If some 
A business must combine all four resources effectively to be successful.

Part 1   The Environment of Business
specific actions are not taken to eliminate losses, 
a firm may be forced to close its doors or file for 
­bankruptcy protection. Although many ­people—
especially stockholders and business ­owners—
believe that profit is literally the bottom line or 
most important goal for a business, many stake-
holders may be just as concerned about a firm’s 
social responsibility record. The term stakeholders 
is used to describe all the different people or groups 
of people who are affected by the policies, decisions, and 
activities made by an organization. Many corporations, for 
example, are careful to point out their efforts to sustain 
the planet, participate in the green ecological movement, 
and help people to live better lives in an annual social 
responsibility report. In its 86-page social responsibility 
report, General Mills describes how it contributed $100 
million in 2010—a 10 percent increase when compared to 
2009—to a wide variety of causes, including support for 
programs that feed the hungry and non-profit organiza-
tions in the United States and around the globe.7 Although 
stockholders and business owners sometimes argue that 
the money that a business contributes to charitable causes 
could have been used to pay larger dividends to stockhold-
ers or increase the return on the owners’ investment, the 
fact is that most socially responsible business firms feel 
social responsibility is the right thing to do and is good 
for business.
The profit earned by a business becomes the property 
of its owners. Thus, in one sense, profit is the reward busi-
ness owners receive for producing goods and services that 
customers want. Profit is also the payment that business 
owners receive for assuming the considerable risks of busi-
ness ownership. One of these is the risk of not being paid. 
Everyone else—employees, suppliers, and lenders—must be 
paid before the owners.
A second risk that owners undertake is the risk of los-
ing whatever they have invested into the business. A business 
that cannot earn a profit is very likely to fail, in which case 
the owners lose whatever money, effort, and time they have 
invested.
To satisfy society’s needs and make a profit, a business 
must operate within the parameters of a nation’s economic 
system. In the next section, we define economics and describe 
two different types of economic systems.
Types of Economic Systems
Economics is the study of how wealth is created and distributed. By wealth, we mean 
“anything of value,” including the goods and services produced and sold by business. 
How wealth is distributed simply means “who gets what.” Experts often use economics 
to explain the choices we make and how these choices change as we cope with the 
demands of everyday life. In simple terms, individuals, businesses, governments, 
and society must make decisions that reflect what is important to each group at a 
particular time. For example, suppose you want to take a weekend trip to some exotic 
vacation spot, and you also want to begin an investment program. Because of your

financial resources, though, you cannot do both, so you must decide what is most 
important. Business firms, governments, and to some extent society face the same types 
of decisions. Each group must deal with scarcity when making important decisions. In 
this case, scarcity means “lack of resources”—money, time, natural resources, and so 
on—that are needed to satisfy a want or need.
Today, experts often study economic problems from two different perspectives: micro-
economics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics is the study of the decisions made by 
individuals and businesses. Microeconomics, for example, examines how the prices of 
homes affect the number of homes individuals will buy. On the other hand, macroeco-
nomics is the study of the national economy and the global economy. Macroeconomics 
examines the economic effect of national income, unemployment, inflation, taxes, gov-
ernment spending, interest rates, and similar factors on a nation and society.
The decisions that individuals, business firms, government, and 
society make, and the way in which people deal with the creation 
and distribution of wealth determine the kind of economic system, 
or economy, that a nation has.
Over the years, the economic systems of the world have differed 
in essentially two ways: (1) the ownership of the factors of produc-
tion and (2) how they answer four basic economic questions that 
direct a nation’s economic activity.
Factors of production are the resources used to produce 
goods and services. There are four such factors:
●
●Land and natural resources—elements that can be used in the 
production process to make appliances, automobiles, and other 
products. Typical examples include crude oil, forests, minerals, 
land, water, and even air.
●
●Labor—the time and effort that we use to produce goods and 
services. It includes human resources such as managers and 
employees.
●
●Capital—the money, facilities, equipment, and machines used 
in the operation of organizations. Although most people think 
of capital as just money, it can also be the manufacturing equip-
ment in a Pepperidge Farm production facility or a computer 
used in the corporate offices of McDonald’s.
Building a Million-Dollar App Business
Entrepreneurial
Success
Nick D’Aloisio, who lives in the south of 
London, England, created his first iPhone 
app when he was 12. Two apps later, teen 
entrepreneur D’Aloisio hit upon a new app 
idea that has brought him into the major leagues of the app 
business world. 
D’Aloisio was searching the Internet for information for 
a term paper when he realized how much time it takes to 
determine the content of each web page. To speed things up, 
he developed an algorithm that summarizes the key points in 
a few words. He named this app Trimit, priced it at 99 cents 
per download, released it on Apple’s App Store, and earned 
$1,600 within the first three days. 
To accelerate Trimit’s momentum, D’Aloisio decided to give 
it away instead of charging for it. The app’s download numbers 
skyrocketed, bringing it to the attention of Horizon Ventures, a 
firm that invests in businesses when they’re in the early stages 
of growth. Horizon invested $250,000 to commercialize the 
app, which was renamed Summly and relaunched a few months 
later. As Summly, the app was downloaded 30,000 times in the 
first week alone, putting D’Aloisio squarely on the path toward 
his goal of building a $1 million app business.

Saving natural resources one bus at a time. 
While “green” used to refer to a color in a box of 
crayons, now it has taken on a whole new meaning. 
For consumers, the government, and businesses, green 
means a new way to save natural resources, to protect 
the environment, and often to reduce our dependence 
on oil from foreign countries.

●Entrepreneurship—the activity that organizes land, labor, and capital. It is the 
willingness to take risks and the knowledge and ability to use the other factors 
of production efficiently. An entrepreneur is a person who risks his or her time, 
effort, and money to start and operate a business.
A nation’s economic system significantly affects all the economic activities of its 
citizens and organizations. This far-reaching impact becomes more apparent when we 
consider that a country’s economic system determines how the factors of production 
are used to meet the needs of society. Today, two different economic systems exist: 
capitalism and command economies. The way each system answers the four basic eco-
nomic questions listed here determines a nation’s economy. 
	 1.	What goods and services—and how much of each—will be produced?
	 2.	How will these goods and services be produced?
	 3.	For whom will these goods and services be produced?
	 4.	Who owns and who controls the major factors of production?
Capitalism
Capitalism is an economic system in which individuals own and operate the majority 
of businesses that provide goods and services. Capitalism stems from the theories of the 
18th-century Scottish economist Adam Smith. In his book Wealth of Nations, published 
in 1776, Smith argued that a society’s interests are best served when the individuals 
within that society are allowed to pursue their own self-interest. According to Smith, 
when individuals act to improve their own fortunes, they indirectly promote the good of 
their community and the people in that community. Smith went on to call this concept the 
“invisible hand.” The invisible hand is a term created by Adam Smith to describe how an 
individual’s own personal gain benefits others and a nation’s economy. For example, the 
only way a small-business owner who produces shoes can increase personal wealth is to 
sell shoes to customers. To become even more prosperous, the small-business owner must 
hire workers to produce even more shoes. According to the invisible hand, people in the 
small-business owner’s community not only would have shoes but also would have jobs 
working for the shoemaker. Thus, the success of people in the community and, to some 
extent, the nation’s economy is tied indirectly to the success of the small-business owner.
Adam Smith’s capitalism is based on the following fundamental issues—also see 
Figure 1.4.
	 1.	The creation of wealth is properly the concern of private individuals, not the 
government.
	 2.	Private individuals must own private property and the resources used to create 
wealth.
	 3.	Economic freedom ensures the existence of competitive markets that allow both 
sellers and buyers to enter and exit the market as they choose.
	 4.	The role of government should be limited to providing defense against foreign 
enemies, ensuring internal order, and furnishing public works and education.

market economy  an economic 
system in which businesses 
and individuals decide what to 
produce and buy, and the market 
determines quantities sold and 
prices
mixed economy  an economy 
that exhibits elements of both 
capitalism and socialism
One factor that Smith felt was extremely important was the role 
of government. He believed that government should act only as rule 
maker and umpire. The French term laissez faire describes Smith’s capi-
talistic ­system and implies that there should be no government interfer-
ence in the economy. Loosely translated, this term means “let them do” 
(as they see fit).
Adam Smith’s laissez-faire capitalism is also based on the concept 
of a market economy. A market economy (sometimes referred to as a 
free-market economy) is an economic system in which businesses and 
individuals decide what to produce and buy, and the market determines 
prices and quantities sold. The owners of resources should be free to 
determine how these resources are used and also to enjoy the income, 
profits, and other benefits derived from ownership of these resources.
Capitalism in the United States
Our economic system is rooted in the laissez-faire capitalism of Adam 
Smith. However, our real-world economy is not as laissez-faire as 
Smith would have liked because government participates as more than 
umpire and rule maker. Our economy is, in fact, a mixed economy, 
one that exhibits elements of both capitalism and socialism.
In a mixed economy, the four basic economic questions discussed 
at the beginning of this section (what, how, for whom, and who) are 
answered through the interaction of households, businesses, and gov-
ernments. The interactions among these three groups are shown in 
Figure 1.5.

An apple a day . . . Regarded as one of the most 
successful and profitable businesses in the very 
competitive technology industry, Apple has a history 
of introducing state-of-the-art consumer products 
like the iPhone and iPad. Although there are many 
ways to obtain Apple products, one way to “try out” 
the latest products is to visit one of their retail stores.
Our economic system is guided by the interaction of buyers and sellers,  
with the role of government being taken into account.

Part 1   The Environment of Business
consumer products  goods and 
services purchased by individuals 
for personal consumption
command economy  an economic 
system in which the government 
decides what goods and services 
will be produced, how they 
will be produced, for whom 
available goods and services will 
be produced, and who owns and 
controls the major factors of 
production
Households  Households, made up of individuals, are the consumers of goods and 
services as well as owners of some of the factors of production. As resource owners, 
the members of households provide businesses with labor, capital, and other resources. 
In return, businesses pay wages, rent, and dividends and interest, which households 
receive as income.
As consumers, household members use their income to purchase the goods and 
services produced by business. Today, approximately 70 percent of our nation’s total 
production consists of consumer products—goods and services purchased by indi-
viduals for personal consumption.8 This means that consumers, as a group, are the 
biggest customers of American business.
Businesses  Like households, businesses are engaged in two different exchanges. 
They exchange money for natural resources, labor, and capital and use these resources 
to produce goods and services. Then they exchange their goods and services for sales 
revenue. This sales revenue, in turn, is exchanged for additional resources, which are 
used to produce and sell more goods and services.
Along the way, of course, business owners would like to remove something 
from the circular flow in the form of profits. When business profits are distributed 
to business owners, these profits become household income. (Business owners are, 
after all, members of households.) Households try to retain some income as sav-
ings. But are profits and savings really removed from the flow? Usually not! When 
the economy is running smoothly, households are willing to invest their savings 
in businesses. They can do so directly by buying stocks issued by businesses, by 
purchasing shares in mutual funds that purchase stocks in businesses, or by lend-
ing money to businesses. They can also invest indirectly by placing their savings in 
bank accounts. Banks and other financial institutions then invest these savings as 
part of their normal business operations. Thus, business profits, too, are retained 
in the business system, and the circular flow in Figure 1.5 is complete. How, then, 
does government fit in?
Governments  The Preamble to the Constitution sets forth the responsibility of the 
government to protect and promote public welfare. The numerous government services 
are important but they (1) would either not be produced by private business firms or 
(2) would be produced only for those who could afford them. Typical services include 
national defense, police, fire protection, education, and construction of roads and high-
ways. To pay for all these services, governments collect a variety of taxes from house-
holds (such as personal income taxes and sales taxes) and from businesses ­(corporate 
income taxes).
Figure 1.5 shows this exchange of taxes for government services. It also shows 
government spending of tax dollars for resources and products required to provide 
these services.
Actually, with government included, our circular flow looks more like a combina-
tion of several flows. In reality, it is. The important point is that together the various 
flows make up a single unit—a complete economic system that effectively provides 
answers to the basic economic questions. Simply put, the system works.
Command Economies
Before we discuss how to measure a nation’s economic performance, we look quickly 
at another economic system called a command economy. A command economy is 
an economic system in which the government decides what goods and services will be 
produced, how they will be produced, for whom available goods and services will be 
produced, and who owns and controls the major factors of production. The answers 
to all four basic economic questions are determined, at least to some degree, through 
centralized government planning. Today, two types of economic systems—socialism 
and communism—serve as examples of command economies.

Socialism  In a socialist economy, the key industries are owned and controlled by 
the government. Such industries usually include transportation, utilities, communica-
tions, banking, and industries producing important materials such as steel. Land, build-
ings, and raw materials may also be the property of the state in a socialist economy. 
Depending on the country, private ownership of smaller businesses is permitted to 
varying degrees. Usually, people may choose their own occupations, although many 
work in state-owned industries.
What to produce and how to produce it are determined in accordance with national 
goals, which are based on projected needs and the availability of resources. The dis-
tribution of goods and services—who gets what—is also controlled by the state to the 
extent that it controls taxes, rents, and wages. Among the professed aims of socialist 
countries are the equitable distribution of income, the elimination of poverty, and the 
distribution of social services (such as medical care) to all who need them. The disad-
vantages of socialism include increased taxation and loss of incentive and motivation 
for both individuals and business owners.
Today, many of the nations that have been labeled as socialist nations tradi-
tionally, including France, Sweden, and India, are transitioning to a free-market 
economy. Currently, many countries that were once thought of as communist coun-
tries are now often referred to as socialist countries. Examples of former communist 
countries often referred to as socialists (or even capitalists) include most of the 
nations that were formerly part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, China, 
and Vietnam.
Communism  If Adam Smith was the father of capitalism, Karl Marx was the father 
of communism. In his writings during the mid-19th century, Marx advocated a class-
less society whose citizens together owned all economic resources. All workers would 
then contribute to this communist society according to their ability and would receive 
benefits according to their need.
Since the breakup of the Soviet Union and economic reforms in China and most 
of the Eastern European countries, the best remaining examples of communism are 
North Korea and Cuba. Today these so-called communist economies seem to practice 
a strictly controlled kind of socialism. The basic four economic questions are answered 
through centralized government plans. Emphasis is placed on the production of goods 
the government needs rather than on the products that consumers might want, so 
there are frequent shortages of consumer goods. Workers have little choice of jobs, but 
­special skills or talents seem to be rewarded with special privileges.
Measuring Economic Performance
Today, it is hard to turn on the radio, watch the news on television, use the Internet, or 
read the newspaper without hearing or seeing something about the economy. Consider 
for just a moment the following questions:
●
●Is the gross domestic product for the United States increasing or decreasing?
●
●Why is the unemployment rate important?
●
●Are U.S. workers as productive as workers in other countries?
The information needed to answer these questions, along with the answers to other 
similar questions, is easily obtainable from many sources. More important, the answers 
to these and other questions can be used to gauge the economic health of the nation. 
For individuals, the health of the nation’s economy can affect: 
●
●the financing you need to continue your education; 
●
●your ability to get a job; and
●
●the amount of interest you pay for credit card purchases, automobiles, homes, and 
other credit transactions. 
Identify the ways to measure 
economic performance.

productivity  the average level of 
output per worker per hour
gross domestic product 
(GDP)  the total dollar value of all 
goods and services produced by all 
people within the boundaries of a 
country during a one-year period
inflation  a general rise in the level 
of prices
deflation  a general decrease in the 
level of prices
The Importance of Productivity 
in the Global Marketplace
One way to measure a nation’s economic performance is to assess 
its productivity. Productivity is the average level of output per 
worker per hour. An increase in productivity results in economic 
growth because a larger number of goods and services are produced 
by a given labor force. To see how productivity affects you and the 
economy, consider the following three questions:
Question: How does productivity growth affect the economy?
Answer: Because of increased productivity, it now takes fewer 
workers to produce more goods and services. As a result, employers 
have reduced costs, earned more profits, and sold their products 
for less. Finally, productivity growth helps American business to 
compete more effectively with other nations in a competitive world.
Question: How does a nation improve productivity?
Answer: Reducing costs and enabling employees to work more 
efficiently are at the core of all attempts to improve productivity. 
For example, productivity in the United States is expected to 
improve dramatically as more economic activity is transferred 
onto the Internet, reducing costs for customer service and handling routine ordering 
functions between businesses. Other methods that can be used to increase productivity 
are discussed in detail in Chapter 8, Producing Quality Goods and Services.
Question: Is productivity growth always good?
Answer: Fewer workers producing more goods and services can lead to higher 
unemployment rates. In this case, increased productivity is good for employers 
but not good for unemployed workers seeking jobs in a very competitive work 
environment. Because employers had been able to produce more goods and services 
with fewer employees during the recent economic crisis, they did not want to 
increase the firm’s salary expense by hiring new employees after the economy began 
to improve. 
The Nation’s Gross Domestic Product
In addition to productivity, a measure called gross domestic product can be used to 
measure the economic well-being of a nation. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the 
total dollar value of all goods and services produced by all people within the boundaries 
of a country during a one-year period. For example, the values of automobiles produced 
by employees in an American-owned General Motors plant and a Japanese-owned 
Toyota plant in the United States are both included in the GDP for the United States. 
The U.S. GDP was $15.1 trillion in 2011.9 (Note: At the time of publication, 2011 was 
the last year for which complete statistics were available.)
The GDP figure facilitates comparisons between the United States and other coun-
tries because it is the standard used in international guidelines for economic account-
ing. It is also possible to compare the GDP for one nation over several different time 
periods. This comparison allows observers to determine the extent to which a nation 
is experiencing economic growth. For example, government experts project that GDP 
will grow to $21.8 trillion by the year 2018.10
To make accurate comparisons of the GDP for different years, we must adjust 
the dollar amounts for inflation. Inflation is a general rise in the level of prices. (The 
opposite of inflation is deflation.) Deflation is a general decrease in the level of prices. 
By using inflation-adjusted figures, we are able to measure the real GDP for a nation. 
In effect, it is now possible to compare the products and services produced by a nation 
in constant dollars—dollars that will purchase the same amount of goods and services. 
Figure 1.6 depicts the GDP of the United States in current dollars and the real GDP in 
One way to reduce costs is to manufacture 
products in a foreign country. In this photo, a 
Chinese worker assembles an electronic keyboard. To 
compete with foreign competition, manufacturers in 
the United States use sophisticated equipment and the 
latest technology to reduce costs, increase profits, and 
improve productivity.

Important Economic Indicators that 
Measure a Nation’s Economy
In addition to productivity, GDP, and real GDP, other economic measures exist that 
can be used to evaluate a nation’s economy. Because of the recent economic crisis, one 
very important statistic that is in the news on a regular basis is the unemployment rate. 
The unemployment rate is the percentage of a nation’s labor force unemployed at any 
time. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, when workers are unemployed, they, 
their families, and the country as a whole lose. Workers and their families lose wages, 
and the country loses the goods or services that could have been produced. In addition, 
the purchasing power of these workers is lost, which can lead to unemployment for 
yet other workers.12 Although the unemployment rate for the United States is typically 
about 4 to 6 percent, it peaked during the recent economic crisis. Despite both federal 
and state programs to reduce the unemployment rate for the United States, it is still 
hovering around 8 percent at the time of publication. This is an especially important 
statistic—especially if you are unemployed. 
The consumer price index (CPI) is a monthly index that measures the changes 
in prices of a fixed basket of goods purchased by a typical consumer in an urban 
area. Goods listed in the CPI include food and beverages, transportation, housing, 
clothing, medical care, recreation, education, communication, and other goods and 
services. Economists often use the CPI to determine the effect of inflation on not only 
the nation’s economy but also individual consumers. Another monthly index is the 
producer price index. The producer price index (PPI) measures prices that producers 
receive for their finished goods. Because changes in the PPI reflect price increases or 
decreases at the wholesale level, the PPI is an accurate predictor of both changes in the 
CPI and prices that consumers will pay for many everyday necessities. 
Some additional economic measures are described in Table 1.2. Like the measures 
for GDP, real GDP, unemployment rate, and price indexes, these measures can be used 
to compare one economic statistic over different periods of time.
The change in GDP and real GDP for the United States from  
one year to another year can be used to measure economic growth.

periods of growth and recession in 
a nation’s economic activity
recession  two or more 
consecutive three-month periods 
of decline in a country’s GDP
The Business Cycle
All industrialized nations of the world seek economic growth, full employment, and 
price stability. However, a nation’s economy fluctuates rather than grows at a steady 
pace every year. In fact, if you were to graph the economic growth rate for a country 
like the United States, it would resemble a roller coaster ride with peaks (high points) 
and troughs (low points). These fluctuations are generally referred to as the business 
cycle, that is, the recurrence of periods of growth and recession in a nation’s economic 
activity. At the time of publication, many experts believed that the U.S. economy was 
showing signs of improvement. However, the recent economic crisis that began in fall 
2007 caused a recession that will require more time before the nation experiences a 
complete recovery. The nation’s unemployment rate is still high. People are reluctant 
to spend money on many consumer goods. Stock prices, although improving, are still 
below the record values experienced a few years ago. Although the federal government 
has enacted a number of stimulus plans designed to help unemployed workers, to shore 
up the nation’s banks and Wall Street firms, to reduce the number of home foreclosures, 
and to free up credit for both individuals and businesses, many 
experts still believe that we have serious financial problems. For 
one, the size of the national debt—a topic described later in this 
section—is a concern. Another problem—the inequality of income 
and wealth—has also become evident as a result of the Occupy Wall 
Street protestors and similar groups of discontented people. To make 
matters worse, the recent economic crisis did not affect just the U.S. 
economy but also the economies of countries around the world.
The changes that result from either economic growth or economic 
downturn affect the amount of products and services that consumers 
are willing to purchase and, as a result, the amount of products and 
services produced by business firms. Generally, the business cycle con-
sists of four phases: the peak (sometimes called prosperity), recession, 
the trough, and recovery (sometimes called expansion).
During the peak period (prosperity), the economy is at its high-
est point and unemployment is low. Total income is relatively high. 
As long as the economic outlook remains prosperous, consumers 
are willing to buy products and services. In fact, businesses often 
expand and offer new products and services during the peak period 
to take advantage of consumers’ increased buying power.
Generally, economists define a recession as two or more consecu-
tive three-month periods of decline in a country’s GDP. Because unem-
ployment rises during a recession, total buying power declines. The 
pessimism that accompanies a recession often stifles both consumer

in the typical business cycle.
The dreaded pink slip.  During the recent economic 
crisis, unemployment rates were over 10 percent 
and millions of Americans got a “pink slip” and lost 
their jobs. While economists still debate if we were 
in a recession or a depression, the economy is now

and business spending. As buying power decreases, consumers tend to become more value 
conscious and reluctant to purchase frivolous or nonessential items. And companies and 
government at all levels often postpone or go slow on major projects during a recession. 
In response to a recession, many businesses focus on producing the products and services 
that provide the most value to their customers. And yet, there are still opportunities out 
there for business firms that are well managed and provide goods and services that their 
customers need. For example, Caterpillar, a global company that produces earth moving 
and construction equipment has profited from the ongoing building boom in developing 
nations, where many basic infrastructure improvements move ahead regardless of what 
the economic conditions are in the rest of the world. 
Economists define a depression as a severe recession that lasts longer than a typi-
cal recession and has a larger decline in business activity when compared to a reces-
sion. A depression is characterized by extremely high unemployment rates, low wages, 
reduced purchasing power, lack of confidence in the economy, lower stock values, and 
a general decrease in business activity.
The third phase of the business cycle is the trough. The trough of a recession or depres-
sion is the turning point when a nation’s production and employment bottom out and reach 
their lowest levels. To offset the effects of recession and depression, the federal government 
uses both monetary and fiscal policies. Monetary policies are the Federal Reserve’s deci-
sions that determine the size of the supply of money in the nation and the level of ­interest 
rates. Through fiscal policy, the government can influence the amount of savings and 
expenditures by altering the tax structure and changing the levels of government spending.
Although the federal government collects approximately $2 trillion in annual revenues, 
the government usually spends more than it receives, resulting in a federal ­deficit. For 
example, the government had a federal deficit for each year between 2002 and 2011. The 
total of all federal deficits is called the national debt. Today, the U.S. national debt is $15.2 
trillion or approximately $49,000 for every man, woman, and child in the United States.13
Since World War II, business cycles have lasted from three to five years from one 
peak period to the next peak period. During the same time period, the average length 
of recessions has been 11 months.14 Some experts believe that effective use of monetary 
and fiscal policies can speed up recovery and reduce the amount of time the economy is 
in recession. Recovery (or expansion) is the movement of the economy from recession 
or depression to prosperity. High unemployment rates decline, income increases, and 
both the ability and the willingness to buy rise.
At the time of publication, many business leaders and politicians were debating 
whether the U.S. economy is still in recession, in the trough, or beginning recovery. 
Unfortunately, many of the problems that caused the recent economic crisis are still 
there, and they will take years to correct and resolve.
Types of Competition
Our capitalist system ensures that individuals and businesses make the decisions 
about what to produce, how to produce it, and what price to charge for the product. 
Mattel, Inc., for example, can introduce new versions of its famous Barbie doll, 
license the Barbie name, change the doll’s price and method of distribution, and 
attempt to produce and market Barbie in other countries or over the Internet at www 
.mattel.com. Our system also allows customers the right to choose between Mattel’s 
products and those produced by competitors.
As a consumer, you get to choose which products or services you want to buy. 
Competition like that between Mattel and other toy manufacturers is a necessary and 
extremely important by-product of capitalism. Business competition is essentially a 
rivalry among businesses for sales to potential customers. In a capitalistic economy, 
competition also ensures that a firm will survive only if it serves its customers well 
by providing products and services that meet needs. Economists recognize four differ-
ent degrees of competition ranging from ideal, complete competition to no competi-
tion at all. These are perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and 
Outline the four types of 
competition.

Part 1   The Environment of Business
perfect (or pure) competition  the 
market situation in which there 
are many buyers and sellers of a 
product, and no single buyer or 
seller is powerful enough to affect 
the price of that product
supply  the quantity of a product 
that producers are willing to sell at 
each of various prices
demand  the quantity of a product 
that buyers are willing to purchase 
at each of various prices
monopoly. For a quick overview of the different types of competi-
tion, ­including numbers of firms and examples for each type, look 
at Table 1.3.
Perfect Competition
Perfect (or pure) competition is the market situation in which 
there are many buyers and sellers of a product, and no single buyer 
or seller is powerful enough to affect the price of that product. For 
perfect competition to exist, there are five very important concepts. 
●
●We are discussing the market for a single product, such as 
bushels of wheat. 
●
●There are no restrictions on firms entering the industry. 
●
●All sellers offer essentially the same product for sale. 
●
●All buyers and sellers know everything there is to know about 
the market (including, in our example, the prices that all sell-
ers are asking for their wheat). 
●
●The overall market is not affected by the actions of any one 
buyer or seller.
When perfect competition exists, every seller should ask the 
same price that every other seller is asking. Why? Because if one 
seller wanted 50 cents more per bushel of wheat than all the others, 
that seller would not be able to sell a single bushel. Buyers could—and would—do bet-
ter by purchasing wheat from the competition. On the other hand, a firm willing to sell 
below the going price would sell all its wheat quickly. However, that seller would lose 
sales revenue (and profit) because buyers are actually willing to pay more.
In perfect competition, then, sellers—and buyers as well—must accept the going 
price. The price of each product is determined by the actions of all buyers and all sellers 
together through the forces of supply and demand.
The Basics of Supply and Demand  The supply of a particular product is the 
quantity of the product that producers are willing to sell at each of various prices. 
Producers are rational people, so we would expect them to offer more of a product for 
sale at higher prices and to offer less of the product at lower prices, as illustrated by 
the supply curve in Figure 1.7.
The demand for a particular product is the quantity that buyers are willing to pur-
chase at each of various prices. Buyers, too, are usually rational, so we would expect 
them—as a group—to buy more of a product when its price is low and to buy less of 
the product when its price is high, as depicted by the demand curve in Figure 1.7.
The Equilibrium, or Market, Price  There is always one certain price at which the 
demand for a product is exactly equal to the quantity of that product produced. Suppose 
that producers are willing to supply two million bushels of wheat at a price of $7 per bushel 
and that buyers are willing to purchase two million bushels at a price of $7 per bushel.

Competition often gives consumers a choice.  Often 
wonder why there are so many soap products? It’s 
called competition. Different manufacturers use product 
differentiation to develop and promote the differences 
between their products and all similar products. Not 
only does product differentiation help their products 
stand out from the competition, it gives you—the 
consumer—a choice.

market price  the price at which 
the quantity demanded is exactly 
equal to the quantity supplied
monopolistic competition  a 
market situation in which there are 
many buyers along with a relatively 
large number of sellers who 
differentiate their products from 
the products of competitors
product differentiation  the 
process of developing and 
promoting differences between 
one’s products and all competitive 
products
In other words, supply and demand are in balance, or in 
equilibrium, at the price of $7. Economists call this price 
the market price. The ­market price of any product is the 
price at which the quantity demanded is exactly equal to 
the quantity supplied. 
In theory and in the real world, market prices are 
affected by anything that affects supply and demand. 
The demand for wheat, for example, might change if 
researchers suddenly discovered that it offered a previ-
ously unknown health benefit. Then buyers would demand 
more wheat at every price. Or the supply of wheat might change 
if new technology permitted the production of greater quanti-
ties of wheat from the same amount of acreage. Other changes 
that can affect competitive prices are shifts in buyer tastes, the 
development of new products, fluctuations in income owing to 
inflation or recession, or even changes in the weather that affect 
the production of wheat.
Perfect competition is quite rare in today’s world. Many real 
markets, however, are examples of monopolistic competition.
Monopolistic Competition
Monopolistic competition is a market situation in which there 
are many buyers along with a relatively large number of sellers. 
The various products available in a monopolistically competitive 
market are very similar in nature, and they are all intended to 
satisfy the same need. However, each seller attempts to make its 
product different from the others by providing unique product features, an attention-getting 
brand name, unique packaging, or services such as free delivery or a lifetime warranty.
Product differentiation is the process of developing and promoting differences 
between one’s products and all competitive products. It is a fact of life for the produc-
ers of many consumer goods, from soaps to clothing to furniture to shoes. A furniture 
manufacturer such as Thomasville sees what looks like a mob of competitors, all trying 
to chip away at its share of the market. By ­differentiating each of its products from all 
The intersection of a supply curve and a demand curve is called the equilibrium, 
or market price. This intersection indicates a single price and quantity 
at which suppliers will sell products and buyers will purchase them.

Why do consumers choose one product instead of 
another?  The next time you go to the discount store, 
supermarket, or drug store, notice all the products 
competing for your dollars. No two canned vegetables, 
shampoos, or candies are exactly alike. Thanks to product 
differentiation, you have a lot of choices when you shop.

Oligopoly
An oligopoly is a market (or industry) situation in which there are few sellers. 
Generally, these sellers are quite large, and sizable investments are required to enter 
into their market. Examples of oligopolies are the automobile, airline, car rental, cereal, 
and farm implement industries.
Because there are few sellers in an oligopoly, the market actions of each seller can 
have a strong effect on competitors’ sales and prices. If General Motors, for example, 
reduces its automobile prices, Ford, Honda, Toyota, and Nissan usually do the same to 
retain their market shares. In the absence of much price competition, product differen-
tiation becomes the major competitive weapon; this is very evident in the advertising of 
the major automobile manufacturers. For instance, when Toyota was faced with declin-
ing sales as a result of quality and safety issues, it began offering buyer incentives to 
attract new-car buyers. Quickly, both Ford and General Motors began offering similar 
incentives and for the same reason—to attract new-car buyers.
Monopoly
A monopoly is a market (or industry) with only one seller, and there are barriers to 
keep other firms from entering the industry. In a monopoly, there is no close substitute 
for the product or service. Because only one firm is the supplier of a product, it would 
seem that it has complete control over price. However, no firm can set its price at some 
astronomical figure just because there is no competition; the firm would soon find that 
it has no customers or sales revenue either. Instead, the firm in a monopoly position 
must consider the demand for its product and set the price at the most profitable level.
Classic examples of monopolies in the United States are public utilities, including 
companies that provide local gas, water, or electricity. Each utility firm operates in a nat-
ural monopoly, an industry that requires a huge investment in capital and within which 
any duplication of facilities would be wasteful. Natural monopolies are permitted to exist 
because the public interest is best served by their existence, but they operate under the 
scrutiny and control of various state and federal agencies. Although many public utilities 
are still classified as natural monopolies, there is increased competition in many areas of 
the country. For example, there have been increased demands for consumer choice when 
selecting a company that provides electrical service to both homes and businesses.
A legal monopoly—sometimes referred to as a limited monopoly—is created when 
a government entity issues a franchise, license, copyright, patent, or trademark. For 
example, a copyright exists for a specific period of time and can be used to protect the 
owners of written materials from unauthorized use by competitors that have not shared 
in the time, effort, and expense required for their development. Because Microsoft 
owns the copyright on its popular Windows software, it enjoys a legal-monopoly 
position. Except for natural monopolies and legal monopolies, federal antitrust laws 
prohibit both monopolies and attempts to form monopolies.
American Business Today
Although our economic system is far from perfect, it provides Americans with 
a high standard of living compared with people in other countries throughout 
the world. Standard of living is a loose, subjective measure of how well off an 
individual or a society is, mainly in terms of want satisfaction through goods and 
services. Also, our economic system offers solutions to many of the problems that 
plague society and provides opportunities for people who are willing to work and 
to continue learning.
To understand the current business environment and the challenges ahead, it helps 
to understand how business developed.

Early Business Development
Our American business system has its roots in the knowledge, skills, and 
values that the earliest settlers brought to this country. The first settlers in 
the United States were concerned mainly with providing themselves with 
basic necessities—food, clothing, and shelter. Almost all families lived on 
farms, and the entire family worked at the business of surviving. They used 
their surplus for trading, mainly by barter, among themselves and with 
the English trading ships that called at the colonies. Barter is a system of 
exchange in which goods or services are traded directly for other goods or 
services without using money. As this trade increased, small businesses began 
to appear. Some settlers were able to use their skills and their excess time 
to work under the domestic system of production. The domestic system 
was a method of manufacturing in which an entrepreneur distributed raw 
materials to various homes, where families would process them into finished 
goods. The merchant entrepreneur then offered the goods for sale.
Then, in 1793, a young English apprentice mechanic named Samuel 
Slater set up a textile factory in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, to spin raw cotton 
into thread. Slater’s ingenuity resulted in America’s first use of the factory 
system of manufacturing, in which all the materials, machinery, and workers 
required to manufacture a product are assembled in one place. The Industrial 
Revolution in America was born. A manufacturing technique called special-
ization was used to improve productivity. Specialization is the separation of 
a manufacturing process into distinct tasks and the assignment of the differ-
ent tasks to different individuals.
The years from 1820 to 1900 were the golden age of invention and innovation 
in machinery. At the same time, new means of transportation greatly expanded the 
domestic markets for American products. Certainly, many basic characteristics of our 
modern business system took form during this time period.
Business Development in the 1900s
Industrial growth and prosperity continued well into the 20th century. Henry Ford’s moving 
automotive assembly line, which brought the work to the worker, refined the concept of 
specialization and helped spur on the mass production of consumer goods. Fundamental 
changes occurred in business ownership and management as well. No longer were the largest 
businesses owned by one individual; instead, ownership was in the hands of thousands of 
corporate shareholders who were willing to invest in—but not to operate—a business.
The Roaring Twenties ended with the sudden crash of the stock market in 1929 
and the near collapse of the economy. The Great Depression that followed in the 1930s 
was a time of misery and human suffering. People lost their faith in business and its 
ability to satisfy the needs of society without government involvement. After Franklin 
D. Roosevelt became president in 1933, the federal government devised a number of 
programs to get the economy moving again. In implementing these programs, the gov-
ernment got deeply involved in business for the first time.
To understand the major events that shaped the United States during the remainder 
of the 20th century, it helps to remember that the economy was compared to a roller 
coaster ride earlier in this chapter—periods of economic growth followed by periods of 
economic slowdown. The following are major events that shaped the nation’s economy 
during the period from 1940 to 2000:
●
●World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War
●
●Rapid economic growth and higher standard of living during the 1950s and 1960s
●
●The social responsibility movement during the 1960s
●
●A shortage of crude oil and higher prices for most goods in the mid-1970s
●
●High inflation, high interest rates, and reduced business profits during the early 1980s
●
●Sustained economic growth in the 1990s
During the last part of the 20th century, the Internet became a major force in the 
economy. e-Business—a topic we will continue to explore throughout this text—became

Gas shortages—could it happen again? 
For an industrialized economy like the United 
States, crude oil is an essential natural 
resource. When the nation experienced a 
shortage of crude oil during the mid-1970s, it 
was common to see signs like the one in this 
photo. Even now, both the supply and price 
for a gallon of gasoline are still concerns as 
the nation begins to rebound from the recent 
economic crisis.

products and services that satisfy 
society’s needs

an accepted method of conducting business. e-Business is the organized effort of indi-
viduals to produce and sell through the Internet, for a profit, the products and services 
that satisfy society’s needs.
Unfortunately, by the last part of the 20th century, a larger number of business 
failures and declining stock values were initial signs that larger economic problems 
were on the way.
A New Century: 2000 and Beyond
According to many economic experts, the first part of the 21st century might be 
characterized as the best of times and the worst of times rolled into one package. On 
the plus side, technology became available at an affordable price. Both individuals and 
businesses could now access information with the click of a button. They also could 
buy and sell merchandise online.
In addition to information technology, the growth of service businesses also changed 
the way American firms do business in the 21st century. Because service businesses employ 
approximately 85 percent of the nation’s workforce, we now have a service economy.15 
A service economy is an economy in which more effort is devoted to the production of 
services than to the production of goods. Typical service businesses include restaurants, 
laundries and dry cleaners, real estate, movie theaters, repair companies, and other ser-
vices that we often take for granted. More information about how service businesses 
affect the economy is provided in Chapter 8, Producing Quality Goods and Services.
On the negative side, it is hard to watch television, surf the Web, listen to the radio, 
or read the newspaper without hearing some news about the economy. Because many 
of the economic indicators described in Table 1.2 on page 20 indicate troubling eco-
nomic problems, there is still a certain amount of pessimism surrounding the economy.
The Current Business Environment
Before reading on, answer the following question:
In today’s competitive business world, which of the following environments affects 
business?
a.	 The competitive environment
b.	The global environment
c.	 The technological environment
d.	The economic environment
e.	 All of the above
Correct Answer:  e. All the environments listed affect business today.
The Competitive Environment  Businesses operate in a competitive environment.
As noted earlier in this chapter, competition is a basic component of capitalism. Every 
day, business owners must figure out what makes their businesses successful and how 
the goods and services they provide are different from the competition. Often, the 
answer is contained in the basic definition of business provided on page 10. Just for a 
moment, review the definition:
Business is the organized effort of individuals to produce and sell, for a profit, the 
goods and services that satisfy society’s needs.
In the definition of business, note the phrase satisfy society’s needs. These three 
words say a lot about how well a successful firm competes with competitors. If you 
meet customer needs, then you have a better chance at success.
The Global Environment  Related to the competitive environment is the global envi-
ronment. Not only do American businesses have to compete with other American busi-
nesses, but they also must compete with businesses from all over the globe. According to 
global experts, China is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. And China is 
not alone. Other countries around the world also compete with U.S. firms. There was once

social media  the online 
interaction that allows people and 
businesses to communicate and 
share ideas, personal information, 
and information about products 
or services
sustainability  meeting the 
needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet their own 
needs
a time when the label “Made in the United States” gave U.S. businesses an inside edge both 
at home and in the global marketplace. Now, other countries manufacture and sell goods. 
According to Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, “There will be 
winners and losers from globalization. We win every time we go shopping because prices 
are lower. Choice is greater because of globalization. But there are losers. There are people 
who will lose their jobs either to foreign competition or [to] technological innovation.”16
While many foreign firms are attempting to sell goods and services to U.S. custom-
ers, U.S. firms are also increasing both sales and profits by selling goods and services to 
customers in other countries. In fact there are many “potential” customers in develop-
ing nations that will buy goods and services manufactured by U.S. firms. For example, 
Procter & Gamble sells laundry detergent, soap, and diapers in Nigeria and has plans 
to do business in more than 50 African countries.17 And Procter & Gamble is not alone. 
Unilever, DuPont, Johnson & Johnson, General Motors, and many more U.S. companies 
are also selling goods and services to customers in countries all over the globe. The world 
is, in fact, a much smaller place than many U.S. business leaders once thought. 
The Technology Environment  Although increased global competition and techno-
logical innovation has changed the way we do business, the technology environment for 
U.S. businesses has never been more challenging. Changes in manufacturing equipment, 
distribution of products, and communication with customers are all examples of how 
technology has changed everyday business practices. For example, many businesses are 
now using social media to provide customers with information about products and 
services. If you ask different people, you will often find different definitions for social 
media, but for our purposes social media is defined as online interaction that allows 
people and businesses to communicate and share ideas, personal information, and 
information about products or services. To illustrate how popular social media is, con-
sider that Facebook with 800 million current users was launched in 2004 and Twitter 
with 300 million current users was launched in 2006. Because of rapid developments in 
social media and the increased importance of technology and information, businesses 
will need to spend additional money to keep abreast of an ever-changing technology 
environment and even more money to train employees to use the new technology.
The Economic Environment  The economic environment must always be con-
sidered when making business decisions. This fact is especially important when the 
nation’s economy takes a nosedive or an individual firm’s sales revenue and profits are 
declining. For example, both small and large business firms reduced both spending and 
hiring new employees over the last four years because of the recent economic crisis.
In addition to economic pressures, today’s socially responsible managers and busi-
ness owners must be concerned about the concept of sustainability. According to the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, sustainability means meeting the needs of 
the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own 
needs.18 Although the word green used to mean a color in a box of crayons, today 
green means a new way of doing business. As a result, a combination of forces, includ-
ing economic factors, growth in population, increased energy use, and concerns for the 
environment, is changing the way individuals live and businesses operate.
When you look back at the original question we asked at the beginning of this 
section, clearly, each different type of environment—competitive, global, technological, 
and economic—affects the way a business does business. As a result, there are always 
opportunities for improvement and challenges that must be considered.
The Challenges Ahead
There it is—the American business system in brief.
When it works well, it provides jobs for those who are willing to work, a standard 
of living that few countries can match, and many opportunities for personal advance-
ment. However, like every other system devised by humans, it is not perfect. Our busi-
ness system may give us prosperity, but it also gave us the Great Depression of the

1930s, the economic problems of the 1970s and the early 1980s, and the economic 
crisis that began in the fall of 2007.
Obviously, the system can be improved. Certainly, there are plenty of people who 
are willing to tell us exactly what they think the American economy needs. However, 
these people often provide us only with conflicting opinions. Who is right and who is 
wrong? Even the experts cannot agree.
The experts do agree, however, that several key issues will challenge our economic sys-
tem (and our nation) over the next decade. Some of the questions to be resolved include:
●
●How can we create a more stable economy and create new jobs for the unemployed?
●
●How can we regulate banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, and other 
financial institutions to prevent the type of abuses that led to the recent economic crisis?
●
●How do we reduce the national debt and still maintain a healthy economy and 
stimulate business growth?
●
●How can we use technology to make American workers more productive and 
American firms more competitive in the global marketplace?
●
●How can we preserve the benefits of competition and small business in our 
American economic system?
●
●How can we encourage economic growth and at the same time continue to con-
serve natural resources and sustain our environment?
●
●How can we meet the needs of two-income families, single parents, older Americans, 
and the less fortunate who need health care and social programs to exist?
●
●How can we defeat terrorism and resolve conflict with Iran, North Korea, and 
other countries throughout the world? 
The answers to these questions are anything but simple. In the past, Americans 
have always been able to solve their economic problems through ingenuity and cre-
ativity. Now, as we continue the journey through the 21st century, we need that same 
ingenuity and creativity not only to solve our current problems but also to compete in 
the global marketplace and build a nation and economy for future generations.
The American business system is not perfect by any means, but it does work rea-
sonably well. We discuss some of its problems in Chapter 2 as we examine the topics 
of social responsibility and business ethics.
Inside
Business
Online games have become big business. In just a few 
years—and during a difficult economic period—founder 
Mark Pincus has transformed Zynga from a start-up game 
company into a profitable, 3,000-employee corporation 
with shares traded on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Social 
media games are about more than winning and losing: 
“We’re giving a reliable 15 minutes a day that lets them 
not only play but also connect with people in their lives 
with some level of meaning,” Pincus explains.
Competing against established rival firms such as 
Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard, Zynga must con-
tinually introduce new games to retain player loyalty and 
keep revenues growing through the sale of virtual goods 
and advertising. Pincus and his management team keep 
a close eye on Zynga’s business health by measuring 
how many people play each game, how many buy virtual 
goods, and which game features are the most popular. 
Can Zynga keep clicking ahead?

petitive, global, technological, and economic), which 
do you think will help and hurt Zynga’s long-term

Chapter 1   Exploring the World of Business and Economics	
29
Discuss what you must do to be successful in the 
world of business.
For many years, people in business—both employees and 
managers—assumed that prosperity would continue. When 
faced with both economic problems and increased competition, 
a large number of these people began to ask the question: 
What do we do now? Although this is a fair question, it is 
difficult to answer. Certainly, for a college student taking 
business courses or an employee just starting a career, the 
question is even more difficult to answer. And yet there are 
still opportunities out there for people who are willing to work 
hard, continue to learn, and possess the ability to adapt to 
change. The kind of career you choose ultimately will depend 
on your own values and what you feel is most important in 
life. By studying business, you can become a better employee 
or manager or you may decide to start your own business. You 
can also become a better consumer and investor.
Define business and identify potential risks and 
rewards.
Business is the organized effort of individuals to produce and 
sell, for a profit, the goods and services that satisfy society’s 
needs. Four kinds of resources—material, human, financial, 
and informational—must be combined to start and operate 
a business. The three general types of businesses are service 
businesses, manufacturers, and marketing intermediaries. 
Profit is what remains after all business expenses are deducted 
from sales revenue. It is the payment that owners receive for 
assuming the risks of business—primarily the risks of not 
receiving payment and of losing whatever has been invested in 
the firm. Although many people believe that profit is literally 
the bottom line or most important goal for a business, many 
corporations are careful to point out their efforts to sustain 
the planet, participate in the green ecological movement, and 
help people to live better lives. 
Define economics and describe the two types 
of economic systems: capitalism and command 
economy.
Economics is the study of how wealth is created and 
distributed. An economic system must answer four questions: 
What goods and services will be produced? How will they 
be produced? For whom will they be produced? Who 
owns and who controls the major factors of production? 
Capitalism (on which our economic system is based) is an 
economic system in which individuals own and operate 
the majority of businesses that provide goods and services. 
Capitalism stems from the theories of Adam Smith. Smith’s 
pure laissez-faire capitalism is an economic system in which 
the factors of production are owned by private entities and 
all individuals are free to use their resources as they see fit; 
prices are determined by the workings of supply and demand 
in competitive markets; and the economic role of government 
is limited to rule maker and umpire. 
Our economic system today is a mixed economy. In 
the circular flow that characterizes our business system (see 
Figure 1.5), households and businesses exchange resources 
for goods and services, using money as the medium of 
exchange. In a similar manner, the government collects taxes 
from businesses and households and purchases products and 
resources with which to provide services.
In a command economy, government, rather than indi-
viduals, owns many of the factors of production and provides 
the answers to the three other economic questions. Socialist 
and communist economies are—at least in theory—command 
economies.
Identify the ways to measure economic 
performance.
One way to evaluate the performance of an economic system 
is to assess changes in productivity, which is the average level 
of output per worker per hour. Gross domestic product (GDP) 
can also be used to measure a nation’s economic well-being and 
is the total dollar value of all goods and services produced by 
all people within the boundaries of a country during a one-year 
period. It is also possible to adjust GDP for inflation and thus to 
measure real GDP. In addition to GDP, other economic indicators 
include a nation’s balance of trade, consumer confidence 
index, consumer price index (CPI), corporate profits, inflation 
rate, national income, new housing starts, prime interest rate, 
producer price index (PPI), and unemployment rate.
Examine the different phases in the typical 
business cycle.
A nation’s economy fluctuates rather than grows at a steady 
pace every year. These fluctuations are generally referred to 
as the business cycle. Generally, the business cycle consists of 
four states: the peak (sometimes called prosperity), recession, 
the trough, and recovery (sometimes called expansion). 
Some experts believe that effective use of monetary policy 
(the Federal Reserve’s decisions that determine the size of 
the supply of money and the level of interest rates) and fiscal 
policy (the government’s influence on the amount of savings 
and expenditures) can speed up recovery.
A federal deficit occurs when the government spends 
more than it receives in taxes and other revenues. At the 
time of publication, the national debt is over $15 trillion or 
approximately $49,000 for every man, woman, and child in 
the United States.
Outline the four types of competition.
Competition is essentially a rivalry among businesses 
for sales to potential customers. In a capitalist economy, 
competition works to ensure the efficient and effective 
operation of business. Competition also ensures that a firm

Part 1   The Environment of Business
will survive only if it serves its customers well by providing 
products and services that meet their needs. Economists 
recognize four degrees of competition. Ranging from most 
to least competitive, the four degrees are perfect competition, 
monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly. The 
factors of supply and demand generally influence the price 
that customers pay producers for goods and services.
Summarize the factors that affect the business 
environment and the challenges that American 
businesses will encounter in the future.
From the beginning of the Industrial Revolution to the 
phenomenal expansion of American industry in the 19th and 
early 20th centuries, our government maintained an essentially 
laissez-faire attitude toward business. However, during the 
Great Depression of the 1930s, the federal government began 
to provide a number of social services to its citizens. 
7
To understand the major events that shaped the United 
States during the remainder of the 20th and 21st century, 
it helps to remember that the economy was compared to a 
roller coaster ride earlier in this chapter—periods of eco-
nomic growth followed by periods of economic slowdown. 
Events and a changing business environment including wars, 
rapid economic growth, the social responsibility move-
ment, a shortage of crude oil, high inflation, high interest 
rates, reduced business profits, increased use of technology, 
e-business, and social media all have shaped business and the 
economy.
Now more than ever before, the way a business operates 
is affected by the competitive environment, global environ-
ment, technological environment, and economic environ-
ment. As a result, business has a number of opportunities for 
improvement and challenges for the future.

Discussion Questions
Nederlander Concerts is based in Los Angeles, one of the two big-
gest markets in the U.S. concert industry (New York is the other). 
The company, which is one of the few remaining family-owned 
businesses in the entertainment industry, specializes in booking 
and promoting musical artists like the Goo Goo Dolls, Maroon 5, 
and Cyndi Lauper for events in the western United States. It owns 
or operates some of the theaters, amphitheaters, and arenas—
including the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, the Santa Barbara 
Bowl, and the Grove in Anaheim—and it rents space for concerts 
and events in other cities along the West Coast. Nederlander 
Concerts also partners with some of California’s major cities such 
as Santa Monica and San Jose to manage or operate their civic 
theaters and present events there.
Since Nederlander Concerts deliberately focuses on small- to 
mid-sized events, it can offer a unique concert experience that 
brings audiences and performers closer together. It can therefore 
sell a high-quality experience at a higher price than seats in a big-
ger theater yield. Because of this high-quality experience, it can 
also count on selling out the house, which helps the company 
and the artists to profit. According to the concert company’s 
chief operating officer, “The key areas or departments of the 
company include talent-buying and marketing, operations, 
finance, and business development. . . . I have a talent-buying 
team, I have a marketing team, we have a general manager of the 
building, we have a substantial team of people who take care of 
the fans, take care of the artist, and look after the shows that 
we buy. We’re in a competitive market, and it’s pretty interesting 
what we do.”
Although it might seem odd that the concert business is a 
competitive one, in fact Nederlander Concerts competes with 
other promoters (like Live Nation) not just for audiences at its 
events but for bookings by popular artists. Therefore, it must 
keep both music lovers and performers happy. Musicians are 
especially concerned with the financial deal they are getting. As 
Nederlander’s chief operating officer explains, “It’s not always 
easy to get the show; there is competition. . . . We have a great 
reputation with the artist. But also there’s one other factor, and 
that’s making the deal. That’s making your best offer. That’s 
­trying to think about whether the agent is . . . telling you that 
your competition is paying more, willing to go more. You have to 
get your own ‘I won’t go above’ number and stop bidding (for 
the act), or you have to say, ‘Okay, I’ll pay a little bit more and 
try to get the show.’ So there’s a real gamesmanship between 
agent and buyer. . . . The art of the deal is something we live with 
every day.”
Given the talent, how does Nederlander get music lovers to its 
events? Says its vice president of marketing, “It’s learning about 
the market, and picking up every newspaper you can find, listening 
to every radio station you can find, watching all of the TV, all the 
news programming. . . . It still comes back to, who is the artist, 
and who is their audience? And how do you find them? . . . The 
number one reason why people don’t go to a show, so they say, is 
that they don’t know about it. Which is infuriating. But we just try 
to make that percentage of people . . . smaller, and smaller, and 
smaller.”
When everything is going well, the company profits. “Where 
we like to do most of our business, and in fact is where we prob-
ably do 90 percent of our business, is in the venues that we own or 
operate, so that the risk profile of those shows goes down . . . we 
have more revenues coming in to ensure that we’re able to cover 
the cost, including the cost of talent, and then walk away with a 
greater profit.”19
Questions
1.	 Nederlander Concerts competes for music lovers with other 
concert arenas and promoters. Do you think it also competes 
with TV, movies, CDs, DVDs, streaming video, and sports 
events? If yes, what implications does this type of competition 
have for Nederlander’s business?
2.	 How many different groups can you think of whose needs 
Nederlander Concerts must satisfy in order to be a successful 
business?
3.	 Give an example showing how Nederlander Concerts uses 
each of the four factors of production.

Today, many companies have a social media presence on 
Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and other sites beyond their corporate 
Web site. Think of three of your favorite car companies and con-
duct a quick search using a search engine like Google or Yahoo! 
Answer the following:
1.	 Name the social networks for each company.
2.	 Compare each of their Facebook pages. How many “likes” 
does each company have? Are there multiple pages for the 
company? How much interaction (or engagement) is on each 
Facebook page?
3.	 What business goals do you think each company is trying to 
reach through their Facebook presence?

Building Skills for Career Success
The company that brought Mickey and Minnie Mouse into the 
public eye has been entertaining families for 90 years. Although 
animation was the Walt Disney Company’s original focus, its enter-
tainment empire now spans four main business groups: studio 
entertainment (including movies, stage shows, and recorded music), 
parks and resorts (such as Disney World and the Disney Cruise 
Line), consumer products (toys, books, and other merchandise), 
and media (including broadcast television, cable television, and 
online media). Disney has its headquarters in Burbank, California, 
but its operations are spread around the world, with $41 billion in 
annual revenues and a workforce of 156,000 employees.
Over the years, Disney has acquired other businesses and started 
new businesses to further strengthen its competitive position and 
its profits. It owns Pixar, the movie studio responsible for Toy Story 
and many other animated films, and it established Touchstone 
Pictures to produce and distribute movies for wider audiences. It 
acquired the ABC television networks and the ESPN sports chan-
nels as part of its drive for global growth in multiple media. To 
expand into interactive media for children, Disney bought the pop-
ular Club Penguin site and began creating online and video games, 
many featuring its popular movie and television characters.
Founder Walt Disney didn’t invent the theme park, but he 
did transform the industry with the 1955 opening of Disneyland 
in California. The magic continued with the 1971 opening 
of Disney World in Florida. Both theme parks were drawing 
crowds from every continent when the company opened Tokyo 
Disneyland in 1983, at the height of the Japanese economic 
boom. Later, it worked with international partners to create 
Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland. Shanghai Disney 
Resort will be the next to open, the result of a $3.7 billion joint 
business venture with a Chinese company. In all, more than 
120 million people visit Disney theme parks and resorts over the 
course of one year.
Disney sees great growth potential in China. Thanks to 
­economic and political changes, Chinese consumers have more 
­disposable income than ever before and more opportunities 
to exercise their higher buying power. Box-office receipts from 
Chinese movie theaters are growing at double-digit rates, and 
many of Disney’s Hollywood blockbusters have also been big 
hits in China. At the same time, competition to get movies into 
Chinese theaters is enormous, because the government limits the 
number of foreign movies that can be distributed nationwide. 
With an eye toward the future, Disney worked with a local part-
ner to ­co-produce Iron Man 3 with a Chinese plot twist. It has 
also been lending its movie-making expertise to help develop the 
Chinese animation industry.
All these years of serving customers with a smile have given 
Disney considerable insight into how to meet the needs of people 
of all ages. The company set up the Disney Institute in 1986 to 
teach businesses, schools, hospitals, and other organizations how 
to deliver good customer service with the famous Disney touch. 
Its experts have trained National Football League staff members 
in preparation for Super Bowl events and given Chevrolet dealer 
employees tips about working with car buyers. When Florida 
Hospital asked for help in improving patient satisfaction, Disney 
experts conducted studies and recommended a number of steps, 
such as having a friendly greeter to put young patients at ease 
and replacing the glare of fluorescent bulbs with recessed lighting. 
These and other changes helped push the hospital’s patient satis-
faction scores into the top 10 percent across America. The Disney 
Institute’s revenues have doubled over the past few years and are 
yet another reason for the company’s profit momentum.20

Assignment
Assume that you are now 25 years old and are interviewing for 
a position as a management trainee in a large corporation. Also 
assume that this position pays $45,000 a year.
1.	 Describe what steps you would take to prepare for this interview.
2.	 Assuming that you get the management trainee position, 
describe the personal traits or skills that you have that will 
help you to become successful.
3.	 Describe the one personal skill or trait that you feel needs 
improvement. How would you go about improving your 
­weakness?
3 	Developing Critical-Thinking Skills
With capitalism, competition is a driving force that allows the 
market economy to work. Let’s see how competition works by 
pretending that you want to buy a new car.
Assignment
1.	 Brainstorm the following questions:
a.	 Where would you go to get information about  
new cars?
b.	 How will you decide on the make and model of car you 
want to buy, where to buy the car, and how to finance it?
c.	 How is competition at work in this scenario?
d.	 What are the pros and cons of competition as it affects 
the buyer?
2.	 Record your ideas.
3.	 Write a summary of the key points you learned about how 
competition works in the marketplace.
4 	Building Team Skills
Over the past few years, employees have been expected to 
­function as productive team members instead of working alone. 
People often believe that they can work effectively in teams, 
but many people find working with a group of people to be a 
­challenge.
College classes that function as teams are more interesting 
and more fun to attend, and students generally learn more about 
the topics in the course. One way to begin creating a team is to 
learn something about each student in the class. This helps team 
members to feel comfortable with each other and fosters a sense 
of trust.
Assignment
1.	 Find a partner, preferably someone you do not know.
2.	 Each partner has two to three minutes to answer the follow-
ing questions:
a.	 What is your name, and where do you work?
b.	 What interesting or unusual thing have you done in your 
life? (Do not talk about work or college; rather, focus on 
such things as hobbies, travel, family, and sports.)
c.	 Why are you taking this course, and what do you expect to 
learn? (Satisfying a degree requirement is not an accept-
able answer.)
3.	 Introduce your partner to the class. Use one to two minutes, 
depending on the size of the class.
5 	Researching Different Careers
In this chapter, entrepreneurship is defined as the willingness to take 
risks and the knowledge and ability to use the other factors of 
production efficiently. An entrepreneur is a person who risks time, 
effort, and money to start and operate a business. Often, people 
believe that these terms apply only to small business. However, 
employees with entrepreneurial attitudes have recently advanced 
more rapidly in large companies as well.
Assignment
1.	 Go to the local library or use the Internet to research how 
large firms, especially corporations, are rewarding employees 
who have entrepreneurial skills.
2.	 Find answers to the following questions:

Part 1   The Environment of Business
Panera Cares About Its Communities
Out of 1,500 Panera bakery-cafés spread across the United States and Canada, a handful 
are slightly different from the rest of the chain. These Panera Cares cafés are owned by the 
nonprofit division of Panera Bread, and the posted menus show “suggested funding levels” 
rather than specific prices. After customers place their orders, they don’t pay at the cash 
register. Instead, they drop money into a donation box, contributing whatever amount they 
wish to pay for their meals. People who can’t afford to pay are encouraged to do their part 
by volunteering some time at the café.
Welcome to Panera Cares, the next phase of an ongoing effort to “make a contribu-
tion to the community in a real, substantive way,” says Ron Shaich, Panera’s founder. 
Although his company has a long history of donating money and food to charitable causes, 
Shaich wanted to do more. His idea was to open pay-what-you-wish cafés where people 
struggling to make ends meet could enjoy a regular restaurant meal with dignity.  
When the first three cafés opened (in Clayton, Missouri; Dearborn, Michigan; and 
Portland, Oregon), Shaich wasn’t sure whether customers who could afford to pay would 
donate as much as expected or how many people with money to spend would take advan-
tage by paying too little or not at all. The goal is for Panera Cares to be self-supporting so 
it can give back to the community with more than meals. So far, approximately 60 percent 
of the customers are donating the suggested amount, 20 percent are donating more, and 
20 percent are donating less. The largest single donation ever made for a meal was $500. 
As long as each location brings in about 80 percent of the suggested funding level, the 
cafes will generate enough profit to keep going and pay for extras such as providing job 
training for teenagers in the local area. “This is not about a handout,” Shaich explains. “This 
is about a hand up, and every one of us has a need for that at some point in our lives.”1

Inside
Business
O
bviously, organizations like Panera want to be recognized as responsible cor-
porate citizens. Such companies recognize the need to harmonize their opera-
tions with environmental demands and other vital social concerns. Not all 
firms, however, have taken steps to encourage a consideration of social responsibility 
and ethics in their decisions and day-to-day activities. Some managers still regard such 
business practices as a poor investment, in which the cost is not worth the return. 
Other managers—indeed, most managers—view the cost of these practices as a neces-
sary business expense, similar to wages or rent.
Most managers today, like those at Panera, are finding ways to balance a growing 
agenda of socially responsible activities with the drive to generate profits. This also 
happens to be a good way for a company to demonstrate its values and to attract 
like-minded employees, customers, and stockholders. In a highly competitive business 
environment, an increasing number of companies are, like Panera, seeking to set them-
selves apart by developing a reputation for ethical and socially responsible behavior.
We begin this chapter by defining business ethics and examining ethical issues. Next, 
we look at the standards of behavior in organizations and how ethical behavior can be 
encouraged. We then turn to the topic of social responsibility. We compare and contrast 
two present-day models of social responsibility and present arguments for and against 
increasing the social responsibility of business. We then examine the major elements of 
the consumer movement. We discuss how social responsibility in business has affected 
employment practices and environmental concerns. Finally, we consider the commit-
ment, planning, and funding that go into a firm’s program of social responsibility.

wrong and of the morality of the 
choices individuals make
business ethics the application of 
moral standards to business situations
Business Ethics Defined
Ethics is the study of right and wrong and of the morality of the choices individuals 
make. An ethical decision or action is one that is “right” according to some standard 
of behavior. Business ethics is the application of moral 
standards to business situations. Recent court cases 
involving unethical behavior have helped to make 
business ethics a matter of public concern. In one such 
case, Copley Pharmaceutical, Inc., pled guilty to federal 
criminal charges (and paid a $10.65 million fine) for 
falsifying drug manufacturers’ reports to the Food and 
Drug Administration. In another much-publicized case, 
lawsuits against tobacco companies have led to $246 
billion in settlements, although there has been only one 
class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of all smokers. The 
case, Engle v. R. J. Reynolds, could cost tobacco companies 
an estimated $500 billion. In yet another case, Adelphia 
Communications Corp., the nation’s fifth-largest cable 
television company, agreed to pay $715 million to settle federal 
investigations stemming from rampant earnings manipulation 
by its founder John J. Rigas, and his son, Timothy J. Rigas. 
Prosecutors and government regulators charged that both 
father and son had misappropriated $2.3 billion of Adelphia 
funds for their own use and had failed to pay the corporation 
for securities they controlled. Consequently, investors lost more 
than $60 billion when Adelphia declared bankruptcy. The tax 
evasion charge against the Rigases was dismissed in early 2012. 
John Rigas and Timothy Rigas are serving 12 years and 17 years 
in prison, respectively. John Rigas applied for a presidential 
pardon in January 2009, but George W. Bush left office without 
making a decision on Rigas’s request. Mr. Rigas is scheduled 
to be released from federal prison in 2018. The Rigases have 
appealed their convictions to the Second Court of Appeals and 
they are awaiting a date from the court for oral arguments.2
Ethical Issues
Ethical issues often arise out of a business’s relationship with investors, customers, 
employees, creditors, or competitors. Each of these groups has specific concerns and 
usually exerts pressure on the organization’s managers. For example, investors want 
management to make sensible financial decisions that will boost sales, profits, and 
returns on their investments. Customers expect a firm’s products to be safe, reliable, 
and reasonably priced. Employees demand to be treated fairly in hiring, promotion, 
and compensation decisions. Creditors require accounts to be paid on time and the 
accounting information furnished by the firm to be accurate. Competitors expect 
the firm’s competitive practices to be fair and honest. Consider TAP Pharmaceutical 
Products, Inc., whose sales representatives offered every urologist in the United States 
a big-screen TV, computers, fax machines, and golf vacations if the doctors prescribed 
TAP’s new prostate cancer drug Lupron. Moreover, the sales representatives sold Lupron 
at cut-rate prices or gratis while defrauding Medicare. Recently, the federal government 
won an $875 million judgment against TAP when a former TAP vice president of sales, 
Douglas Durand, and Dr. Joseph Gerstein blew the whistle.3
In late 2006, Hewlett-Packard Co.’s chairman, Patricia Dunn, and general coun-
sel, Ann Baskins, resigned amid allegations that the company used intrusive tactics in 
observing the personal lives of journalists and the company’s directors, thus tarnishing

Business ethics apply to customers as well as to managers 
and employees. In some buying situations, the “right” 
thing to do isn’t always clear, is it? For example, should 
you buy from a retail store that has been found to be unfair 
to its employees? Read on for tips about recognizing and 
resolving ethical issues.

Hewlett-Packard’s reputation for integrity. According to Congressman John Dingell of 
Michigan, “We have before us witnesses from Hewlett-Packard to discuss a plunder-
ers’ operation that would make (former president) Richard Nixon blush were he still 
alive.” Alternatively, consider Bernard Madoff, former stockbroker, financial advisor, 
and chairman of the NASDAQ stock exchange. In 2009, he was convicted of securi-
ties and other frauds including a Ponzi scheme that defrauded clients of $65 billion. 
Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison.
Businesspeople face ethical issues every day, and some of these issues can be diffi-
cult to assess. Although some types of issues arise infrequently, others occur regularly. 
Let’s take a closer look at several ethical issues.
Fairness and Honesty
Fairness and honesty in business are two important ethical concerns. Besides obeying all 
laws and regulations, businesspeople are expected to refrain from knowingly deceiving, 
misrepresenting, or intimidating others. The consequences of failing to do so can be 
expensive. Recently, for example, Keith E. Anderson and Wayne Anderson, the leaders 
of an international tax shelter scheme known as Anderson’s Ark and Associates, were 
sentenced to as many as 20 years in prison. The Andersons; Richard Marks, their 
chief accounting officer; and Karolyn Grosnickle, the chief administrative officer, were 
ordered to pay more than $200 million in fines and restitution.4 More than 1,500 
clients of Anderson’s Ark and Associates lost about $31 million. In yet another case, 
the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP agreed to pay the U.S. government 
$42 million to resolve allegations that it made false claims in connection with travel 
reimbursements it collected for several federal agencies.5
Deere & Company requires each employee to deal fairly with its customers, sup-
pliers, competitors, and employees. “No employee should take unfair advantage of 
anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepre-
sentation of material facts or any other unfair dealing practice.” Employees are encour-
aged to report possible violations of company ethics policies using a 24-hour hotline or 
anonymous e-mails. Reporting is not only encouraged; it is an accepted and protected 
behavior.6
Personal data security breaches have become a major threat to personal privacy in 
the new millennium. Can businesses keep your personal data secure?
Organizational Relationships
A businessperson may be tempted to place his or her personal welfare above the 
welfare of others or the welfare of the organization. For example, in late 2002, 
former CEO of Tyco International, Ltd, Leo Dennis Kozlowski, 
was indicted for misappropriating $43 million in corporate funds 
to make philanthropic contributions in his own name, including 
$5 million to Seton Hall University, which named its new business-
school building Kozlowski Hall. Furthermore, according to Tyco, 
the former CEO took $61.7 million in interest-free relocation loans 
without the board’s permission. He allegedly used the money to 
finance many personal luxuries, including a $15 million yacht and 
a $3.9 million Renoir painting, and to throw a $2 million party for 
his wife’s birthday. Mr. Kozlowski, currently serving up to 25 years 
in prison, paid $134 million in restitution to Tyco and criminal 
fines of $70 million. In 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court denied his 
petition for a judicial review.7
Relationships with customers and co-workers often create 
ethical problems. Unethical behavior in these areas includes tak-
ing credit for others’ ideas or work, not meeting one’s commit-
ments in a mutual agreement, and pressuring others to behave 
unethically.
Violating ethics can be humiliating and costly.

Conflict of Interest
Conflict of interest results when a businessperson takes advantage of a situation for 
his or her own personal interest rather than for the employer’s interest. Such conflict 
may occur when payments and gifts make their way into business deals. A wise rule to 
remember is that anything given to a person that might unfairly influence that person’s 
business decision is a bribe, and all bribes are unethical.
For example, Nortel Networks Corporation does not permit its employees, offi-
cers, and directors to accept any gifts or to serve as directors or officers of any orga-
nization that might supply goods or services to Nortel Networks. However, Nortel 
employees may work part-time with firms that are not competitors, suppliers, or 
customers. At AT&T, employees are instructed to discuss with their supervisors any 
investments that may seem improper. Verizon Communications forbids its employees 
and executives from holding a “significant” financial stake in vendors, suppliers, or 
customers.
At Procter & Gamble Company (P&G), all employees are obligated to act at all 
times solely in the best interests of the company. A conflict of interest arises when an 
employee has a personal relationship or financial or other interest that could interfere 
with this obligation, or when an employee uses his or her position with the company 
for personal gain. P&G requires employees to disclose all potential conflicts of inter-
est and to take prompt actions to eliminate a conflict when the company asks them to 
do so. Generally, it is not acceptable to receive gifts, entertainment, or other gratuities 
from people with whom P&G does business because doing so could imply an obliga-
tion on the part of the company and potentially pose a conflict of interest.
Communications
Business communications, especially advertising, can present ethical questions. False 
and misleading advertising is illegal and unethical, and it can infuriate customers. 
Sponsors of advertisements aimed at children must be especially careful to avoid 
misleading messages. Advertisers of health-related products also must take precautions 
to guard against deception when using such descriptive terms as low fat, fat free, and 
light. In fact, the Federal Trade Commission has issued guidelines on the use of these 
labels.
Factors Affecting Ethical Behavior
Is it possible for an individual with strong moral values to make ethically questionable 
decisions in a business setting? What factors affect a person’s inclination to make either 
ethical or unethical decisions in a business organization? Although the answers to these 
questions are not entirely clear, three general sets of factors do appear to influence the 
standards of behavior in an organization. As shown in Figure 2.1, the sets consist of 
individual factors, social factors, and opportunities.
Discuss the factors that affect 
the level of ethical behavior in 
organizations.

Part 1   The Environment of Business
Individual Factors Affecting Ethics
Several individual factors influence the level of ethical behavior in an organization.
●
●Individual knowledge of an issue. How much an individual knows about an issue 
is one factor. A decision maker with a greater amount of knowledge regarding a 
situation may take steps to avoid ethical problems, whereas a less-informed person 
may take action unknowingly that leads to an ethical quagmire.
●
●Personal values. An individual’s moral values and central, value-related attitudes 
also clearly influence his or her business behavior. Most people join organizations 
to accomplish personal goals.
●
●Personal goals. The types of personal goals an individual aspires to and the man-
ner in which these goals are pursued have a significant impact on that individual’s 
behavior in an organization. The actions of specific individuals in scandal-plagued 
companies, such as Adelphia, Arthur Anderson, Enron, Halliburton, Qwest, 
and WorldCom, often raise questions about individuals’ personal character and 
integrity.
Social Factors Affecting Ethics
●
●Cultural norms. A person’s behavior in the workplace, to some degree, is deter-
mined by cultural norms, and these social factors vary from one culture to another. 
For example, in some countries it is acceptable and ethical for customs agents to 
receive gratuities for performing ordinary, legal tasks that are a part of their jobs, 
whereas in other countries these practices would be viewed as unethical and per-
haps illegal.
●
●Co-workers. The actions and decisions of co-workers constitute another social 
factor believed to shape a person’s sense of business ethics. For example, if your 
co-workers make long-distance telephone calls on company time and at company 
expense, you might view that behavior as acceptable and ethical because everyone 
does it.
●
●Significant others. The moral values and attitudes of “significant others”—spouses, 
friends, and relatives, for instance—also can affect an employee’s perception of 
what is ethical and unethical behavior in the workplace.
●
●Use of the Internet. Even the Internet presents new challenges for firms whose 
employees enjoy easy access to sites through convenient high-speed connections at 
work. An employee’s behavior online can be viewed as offensive to co-workers and 
possibly lead to lawsuits against the firm if employees engage in unethical behavior 
on controversial Web sites not related to their job. Interestingly, one recent survey 
of employees found that most workers assume that their use of technology at work 
will be monitored. A large majority of employees approved of most monitoring 
methods such as monitoring faxes and e-mail, tracking Web use, and even record-
ing telephone calls.
“Opportunity” as a Factor Affecting Ethics
●
●Presence of opportunity. Opportunity refers to the amount of freedom an organi-
zation gives an employee to behave unethically if he or she makes that choice. In 
some organizations, certain company policies and procedures reduce the oppor-
tunity to be unethical. For example, at some fast-food restaurants, one employee 
takes your order and receives your payment, and another fills the order. This pro-
cedure reduces the opportunity to be unethical because the person handling the 
money is not dispensing the product, and the person giving out the product is not 
handling the money.
●
●Ethical codes. The existence of an ethical code and the importance management 
places on this code are other determinants of opportunity (codes of ethics are dis-
cussed in more detail in the next section).

Chapter 2   Being Ethical and Socially Responsible	
41
●
●Enforcement. The degree of enforcement of company policies, procedures, and 
ethical codes is a major force affecting opportunity. When violations are dealt with 
consistently and firmly, the opportunity to be unethical is reduced.
Do you make personal telephone calls on company time? Many individuals do. 
Although most employees limit personal calls to a few minutes, some make personal 
calls in excess of 30 minutes. Whether you use company time and equipment to make 
personal calls is an example of a personal ethical decision.
Now that we have considered some of the factors believed to influence the level of 
ethical behavior in the workplace, let us explore what can be done to encourage ethical 
behavior and to discourage unethical behavior.
Encouraging Ethical Behavior
Most authorities agree that there is room for improvement in business ethics. A more 
problematic question is: Can business be made more ethical in the real world? The 
majority opinion on this issue suggests that government, trade associations, and 
individual firms indeed can establish acceptable levels of ethical behavior.
Government’s Role in Encouraging Ethics
The government can encourage ethical behavior by legislating more stringent 
regulations. For example, the landmark Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 provides 
sweeping new legal protection for those who report corporate misconduct. At the 
signing ceremony, President George W. Bush stated, “The act adopts tough new 
provisions to deter and punish corporate and accounting fraud and corruption, 
ensure justice for wrongdoers, and protect the interests of workers and shareholders.” 
Among other things, the law deals with corporate responsibility, conflicts of 
interest, and corporate accountability. However, rules require enforcement, and the 
unethical businessperson frequently seems to “slip something by” without getting 
caught. Increased regulation may help, but it surely cannot solve the entire ethics 
problem.
Trade Associations’ Role in Encouraging Ethics
Trade associations can and often do provide ethical guidelines 
for their members. These organizations, which operate within 
particular industries, are in an excellent position to exert pressure 
on members who stoop to questionable business practices. For 
example, recently, a pharmaceutical trade group adopted a 
new set of guidelines to halt the extravagant dinners and other 
gifts sales representatives often give to physicians. However, 
enforcement and authority vary from association to association. 
Because trade associations exist for the benefit of their members, 
harsh measures may be self-defeating.
Individual Companies’ Role 
in Encouraging Ethics
Codes of ethics that companies provide to their employees are 
perhaps the most effective way to encourage ethical behavior. 
A code of ethics is a written guide to acceptable and ethical 
behavior as defined by an organization; it outlines uniform 
policies, standards, and punishments for violations. Because 
employees know what is expected of them and what will happen 
if they violate the rules, a code of ethics goes a long way toward 
encouraging ethical behavior. However, codes cannot possibly 
Explain how ethical decision 
making can be encouraged.

cover every situation. Companies also must create an environment in which employees 
recognize the importance of complying with the written code. Managers must provide 
direction by fostering communication, actively modeling and encouraging ethical 
decision making, and training employees to make ethical decisions.
During the 1980s, an increasing number of organizations created and implemented 
ethics codes. In a recent survey of Fortune 1000 firms, 93 percent of the companies 
that responded reported having a formal code of ethics. Some companies are now even 
taking steps to strengthen their codes. For example, to strengthen its accountability, the 
Healthcare Financial Management Association recently revised its code to designate 
contact persons who handle reports of ethics violations, to clarify how its board of 
directors should deal with violations of business ethics, and to guarantee a fair hearing 
process. S. C. Johnson & Son, makers of Pledge®, Drano®, Windex®, and many other 
household products, is another firm that recognizes that it must behave in ways the pub-
lic perceives as ethical; its code includes expectations for employees and its commitment 
to consumers, the community, and society in general. As shown in Figure 2.2, the ethics 
code of electronics giant Texas Instruments (TI) includes issues relating to policies and 
procedures; laws and regulations; relationships with customers, suppliers, and competi-
tors; conflicts of interest; handling of proprietary information; and code enforcement.
Assigning an ethics officer who coordinates ethical conduct gives employees some-
one to consult if they are not sure of the right thing to do. An ethics officer meets with 
employees and top management to provide ethical advice, establishes and maintains 
an anonymous confidential service to answer questions about ethical issues, and takes 
action on ethics code violations.
Sometimes even employees who want to act ethically may find it difficult to do 
so. Unethical practices can become ingrained in an organization. Employees with high 
personal ethics may then take a controversial step called whistle-blowing. Whistle-
blowing is informing the press or government officials about unethical practices within 
one’s organization.
The year 2002 was labeled as the “Year of the Whistle-Blower.” Consider Joe 
Speaker, a 40-year-old acting chief financial officer (CFO) at Rite Aid Corp. in 1999. 
He discovered that inventories at Rite Aid had been overvalued and that millions in  
expenses had not been reported properly. Further digging into Rite Aid’s books revealed 
that $541 million in earnings over the previous two years was really $1.6 billion in losses. 
Mr. Speaker was a main government witness when former Rite Aid Corp. Chairman 
and CEO Martin L. Grass went on trial. Mr. Speaker is among dozens of corporate 
managers who have blown the whistle. Enron’s Sherron S. Watkins and WorldCom’s 
Cynthia Cooper are now well-known whistle-blowers and Time magazine’s persons 
of the year 2002. According to Linda Chatman Thomsen, deputy director for enforce-
ment at the Securities and Exchange Commission, “Whistle-blowers give us an insider’s 
perspective and have advanced our investigation immeasurably.”
Whistle-blowing could have averted disaster and prevented needless deaths in the 
Challenger space shuttle disaster, for example. How could employees have known 
about life-threatening problems and let them pass? Whistle-blowing, however, can have 
serious repercussions for employees: Those who “blow whistles” sometimes lose their 
jobs. However, the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 protects whistle-blowers who report 
corporate misconduct. Any executive who retaliates against a whistle-blower can be 
held criminally liable and imprisoned for up to ten years.
Retaliations do occur, however. For example, in 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the 8th Circuit unanimously upheld the right of Jane Turner, a 25-year veteran FBI 
agent, to obtain monetary damages and a jury trial against the FBI. The court held 
that Ms. Turner presented sufficient facts to justify a trial by jury based on the FBI’s 
retaliatory transfer of Ms. Turner from her investigatory position in Minot, North 
Dakota, to a demeaning desk job in Minneapolis. Kris Kolesnik, executive director 
of the National Whistle Blower Center, said, “Jane Turner is an American hero. She 
refused to be silent when her co-agents committed misconduct in a child rape case. 
She refused to be silent when her co-agents stole property from Ground Zero. She 
paid the price and lost her job. The 8th Circuit Court did the right thing and insured

that justice will take place in her case.” In 2008, the U.S. government was ordered 
to pay $1 million in legal fees to Turner’s lawyers. The Whistleblower Protection Act 
of 1989 protects federal employees who report an agency’s misconduct. The Obama 
administration is attempting to pass a law that would further protect the government 
whistle-blowers.8

Defining Acceptable Behavior: Texas Instruments’ Code of Ethics
“Integrity is the foundation on which TI is built. There is no other characteristic more essential to a 
TIer’s makeup. It has to be present at all levels. Integrity is expected of managers and individuals when 
they make commitments. They are expected to stand by their commitments to the best of their ability.
One of TI’s greatest strengths is its values and ethics. We had some early leaders who set those 
values as the standard for how they lived their lives. And it is important that TI grew that way. It’s 
something that we don’t want to lose. At the same time, we must move more rapidly. But we don’t 
want to confuse that with the fact that we’re ethical and we’re moral. We’re very responsible, and we 
live up to what we say.”
Tom Engibous, President and CEO
Texas Instruments, 1997
We Respect and Value People By:
 Exercising the basic virtues of respect, dignity, kindness, courtesy and manners in all work 
relationships.
 Recognizing and avoiding behaviors that others may ﬁnd offensive, including the manner in which 
we speak and relate to one another and the materials we bring into the workplace, both printed 
and electronically.
 Respecting the right and obligation of every TIer to resolve concerns relating to ethics questions 
in the course of our duties without retribution and retaliation.
 Giving all TIers the same opportunity to have their questions, issues and situations fairly 
considered while understanding that being treated fairly does not always mean that we will all be 
treated the same.
 Trusting one another to use sound judgment in our use of TI business and information systems.
 Understanding that even though TI has the obligation to monitor its business information 
systems activity, we will respect privacy by prohibiting random searches of individual TIers’ 
communications.
 Recognizing that conduct socially and professionally acceptable in one culture and country may be 
viewed differently in another.
We Are Honest By:
 Offering full disclosure and withdrawing ourselves from discussions and decisions when our 
business judgment appears to be in conﬂict with a personal interest.
 Respecting the rights and property of others, including their intellectual property. Accepting 
conﬁdential or trade secret information only after we clearly understand our obligations as deﬁned 
in a nondisclosure agreement.
 Competing fairly without collusion or collaboration with competitors to divide markets, set prices, 
restrict production, allocate customers or otherwise restrain competition.
 Assuring that no payments or favors are offered to inﬂuence others to do something wrong.
 Keeping records that are accurate and include all payments and receipts.
 Exercising good judgment in the exchange of business courtesies, meals and entertainment

Part 1   The Environment of Business
social responsibility the 
recognition that business activities 
have an impact on society and the 
consideration of that impact in 
business decision making
When firms set up anonymous hotlines to handle ethically questionable situa-
tions, employees actually may be more likely to engage in whistle-blowing. When firms 
instead create an environment that educates employees and nurtures ethical behav-
ior, fewer ethical problems arise. Ultimately, the need for whistle-blowing is greatly 
reduced.
It is difficult for an organization to develop ethics codes, policies, and procedures 
to deal with all relationships and every situation. When no company policies or pro-
cedures exist or apply, a quick test to determine if a behavior is ethical is to see if 
others—co-workers, customers, and suppliers—approve of it. Ethical decisions will 
always withstand scrutiny. Openness and communication about choices will often 
build trust and strengthen business relationships. Table 2.1 provides some general 
guidelines for making ethical decisions.
Social Responsibility 
Social responsibility is the recognition that business activities have an impact on 
society and the consideration of that impact in business decision making. In the first 
few days after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, Walmart delivered $20 million 
in cash (including $4 million to employees displaced by the storm), 100 truckloads 
of free merchandise, and food for 100,000 meals. The company also promised a job 
elsewhere for every one of its workers affected by the catastrophe. Obviously, social 
responsibility costs money. It is perhaps not so obvious—except in isolated cases—that 
social responsibility is also good business. Customers eventually find out which firms 
act responsibly and which do not. Just as easily as they can purchase a product made 
by a company that is socially responsible, they can choose against buying from the 
firm that is not.
Consider the following examples of organizations that are attempting to be socially 
responsible:
●
●Social responsibility can take many forms—including flying lessons. Through Young 
Eagles, underwritten by S. C. Johnson, Phillips Petroleum, Lockheed Martin, Jaguar, 
and other corporations, 22,000 volunteer pilots have taken a half million young-
sters on free flights designed to teach flying basics and inspire excitement about 
Table 2.1 	
Guidelines for Making Ethical Decisions
1.  Listen and learn.
Recognize the problem or decision-making opportunity that confronts your company, team, or 
unit. Don’t argue, criticize, or defend yourself—keep listening and reviewing until you are sure that 
you understand others.
2.  Identify the ethical 
issues.
Examine how co-workers and consumers are affected by the situation or decision at hand. 
Examine how you feel about the situation, and attempt to understand the viewpoint of those 
involved in the decision or in the consequences of the decision.
3.  Create and analyze 
options.
Try to put aside strong feelings such as anger or a desire for power and prestige and come up 
with as many alternatives as possible before developing an analysis. Ask everyone involved for 
ideas about which options offer the best long-term results for you and the company. Then decide 
which option will increase your self-respect even if, in the long run, things don’t work out the way 
you hope they will.
4.  Identify the best 
option from your 
point of view.
Consider it and test it against some established criteria, such as respect, understanding, caring, 
fairness, honesty, and openness.
5.  Explain your 
decision and resolve 
any differences that 
arise.
This may require neutral arbitration from a trusted manager or taking “time out” to reconsider, 
consult, or exchange written proposals before a decision is reached.

●The General Mills Foundation, created in 1954, is one of the nation’s largest com-
pany-sponsored foundations. Since the General Mills Foundation was created, it 
has awarded more than $535 million to its communities.
In the Twin Cities, the General Mills Foundation provides grants for youth 
nutrition and fitness, education, arts and culture, social services, and the United 
Way. Beyond financial resources, the General Mills Foundation also supports 
organizations with volunteers and mentors who share their expertise and talents. 
For example, General Mills plays a leadership role in supporting education, arts, 
and cultural organizations by matching employee and retiree contributions dollar 
for dollar. Recently, the Foundation donated $28.2 million in food to Feeding 
America, the largest hunger-relief organization in the United States. Food is also 
donated following natural disasters such as, devastating earthquakes in Haiti and 
Chile, and flood relief in Pakistan.9

●As part of Dell’s commitment to the community, the Dell Foundation contrib-
utes significantly to the quality of life in communities where Dell employees 
live and work. The Dell Foundation supports innovative and effective programs 
that provide fundamental prerequisites to equip youth to learn and excel in 
a world driven by the digital economy. The Dell Foundation supports a wide 
range of programs that benefit children from newborn to 17 years of age in 
Dell’s principal U.S. locations and welcomes proposals from non-profit orga-
nizations that address health and human services, education, and technology 
access for youth.
Globally, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation has contributed more than 
$700 million to improve student performance and increase access to education so 
that all children have the opportunity to achieve their dreams.10

●Improving public schools around the world continues to be IBM’s top social prior-
ity. Its efforts are focused on preparing the next generation of leaders and work-
ers. Through Reinventing Education and other strategic efforts, IBM is solving 
education’s toughest problems with solutions that draw on advanced information 
technologies and the best minds IBM can apply. Its programs are paving the way 
for reforms in school systems around the world.
IBM launched the World Community Grid in November 2004. It 
combines excess processing power from thousands of computers into a virtual 
supercomputer. This grid enables researchers to gather and analyze unprecedented 
quantities of data aimed at advancing research on genomics, diseases, and natural 
disasters. The first project, the Human Proteome Folding 
Project, assists in identifying cures for diseases such as malaria 
and tuberculosis and has registered 85,000 devices around the 
world to date.
Recently, as IBM celebrated its centennial, the company 
announced that Africa is the destination for is 100th team and 
1,000th employee involved in the company’s Corporate Service 
Corps. Often called a “corporate version” of the Peace Corps, 
this program has made a direct economic impact in many of 
the 20 countries it has helped. Participants, who are selected 
from among IBM’s highest performing employees, provide 
technology-related assistance to both local governments and 
community organizations. Issues they tackle include local 
economic development, entrepreneurship, transportation, 
education, citizen services, health care, and disaster recovery. 
Stanley S. Litow, IBM’s vice president of Corporate Citizenship 
and Corporate Affairs, and president of IBM’s Foundation 
stated, “Our Corporate Service Corps program epitomizes the 
progressive ethics of IBM’s employees, both today and 100 
years ago.”11
Social responsibility is good business. ICAP, the 
world’s largest interdealer broker in Jersey City, New 
Jersey, hosts its 16th annual global Charity Day during 
which the company revenues are donated to over 100 
charities around the world.

●General Electric Company (GE) has a long history of supporting the communities 
where its employees work and live through GE’s unique combination of resources, 
equipment, and employees’ and retirees’ hearts and souls. Today GE’s responsibil-
ity extends to communities around the world.
GE applies its long-standing spirit of innovation and unique set of capabilities 
to take on tough challenges in its communities. For example, recently, GE awarded a  
five-year grant of $20 million to Milwaukee Public Schools to improve academic 
achievement and better prepare students for college and career opportunities, with 
a focus on math and science programs. This grant is a part of the GE Foundation 
Developing Futures™ in Education program, an initiative to ensure that U.S. 
students are prepared to compete in an increasingly competitive global economy.12

●With the help of dedicated Schwab volunteers, the Charles Schwab Foundation pro-
vides programs and funding to help individuals fill the information gap. For example, 
Schwab MoneyWise helps adults teach—and children learn—the basics of financial 
literacy. Interactive tools are available at http://schwabmoneywise.com, and local 
workshops cover topics such as getting kids started on a budget. In addition to these 
efforts, widely distributed publications and news columns by foundation President 
Carrie Schwab Pomerantz promote financial literacy on a wide range of topics—
from saving for a child’s education to bridging the health insurance gap for retirees. 
Since its founding in 1993, Charles Schwab Foundation has made contributions 
averaging $4 million a year to more than 2,300 nonprofit organizations.13

●Improving basic literacy skills in the United States is among the Verizon Foundation’s 
major priorities because of its enormous impact on education, health, and eco-
nomic development. Here in the United States, more than 30 million American 
adults have basic or below-average literacy skills. Thinkfinity.org is designed to 
improve education and literacy achievement. This comprehensive free Web site 
delivers online resources to advance student achievement. Thinkfinity delivers top-
quality K–12 lesson plans, student materials, interactive tools, and connections to 
educational Web sites. It gives teachers, instructors, and parents the tools they need 
to increase student performance.
Recently, Verizon employees and retirees donated more than 608,000 hours 
of service and, with the Verizon Foundation, contributed more than $25 million 
in combined matching gift funds, making Verizon Volunteers one of the largest 
corporate volunteer incentive programs in the United States.

●ExxonMobil’s commitment to education spans all levels of achievement. One of its cor-
porate primary goals is to support basic education and literacy programs in the develop-
ing world. In areas of the world where basic education levels have been met, ExxonMobil 
supports education programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
ExxonMobil recognizes the essential role that proficiency in math and 
science plays not only in the energy business but also in fostering innovation and 
facilitating human progress. The company encourages new generations to pursue 
studies and careers in fields involving mathematics and science. Toward this goal, 
it supports programs focused on laying the foundation for long-term educational 
improvements, such as the National Math and Science Initiative and the Mickelson 
ExxonMobil Teachers Academy.
In recognition of 2011 International Women’s Day, ExxonMobil granted 
$6 million to support economic opportunities for women around the world. In 
announcing the grant, Suzanne McCarron, president of ExxonMobil Foundation 
said, “Research tells us that the success of women entrepreneurs is key to building 
communities. When women thrive economically, entire societies are transformed 
by becoming healthier, more stable and more prosperous.” Recently, ExxonMobil, 
its employees, and retirees provided $238 million in contributions worldwide.14

activities are directed toward education. Since 1911, AT&T has been a sponsor to 
the Telephone Pioneers of America, the world’s largest industry-based volunteer 
organization consisting of nearly 750,000 employees and retirees from the telecom-
munications industry. Each year, the Pioneers volunteer millions of hours and raise 
millions of dollars for health and human services and the environment. In schools 
and neighborhoods, the Pioneers strengthen connections and build communities.
To respond to the high school drop-out crisis, AT&T launched Aspire, a  
$100 million philanthropic program that focuses on the crisis. It is the biggest and 
most significant investment in education in the company’s history. The job shadowing 
program had reached more than 23,000 students in more than 200 cities. By summer 
of 2013, the program will provide 100,000 students with the opportunity to learn 
more about career options and what it takes to be successful in today’s workforce.15

●At Merck & Co., Inc., the Patient Assistance Program makes the company’s med-
icines available to low-income Americans and their families at no cost. When 
patients do not have health insurance or a prescription drug plan and are unable to 
afford the Merck medicines their doctors prescribe, they can work with their phy-
sicians to contact the Merck Patient Assistance Program. For more than 50 years, 
Merck has provided its medicines completely free of charge to people in need 
through this program. Patients can get information through www.merck.com; by 
calling a toll-free number, 1-800-727-5400; or from their physician’s office. For 
eligible patients, the medicines are shipped directly to their home or the prescrib-
ing physician’s office. Each applicant may receive up to one year of medicines, and 
patients may reapply to the program if their need continues.
Established in 1957, the Merck Company Foundation has contributed more 
than $560 million to develop and initiate programs that help improve the health and 
well-being of people around the world. According to Richard T. Clark, chairman, 
president, and CEO, “Merck established the Foundation more than 50 years ago 
because we knew that along with corporate success comes social responsibility.”
Education programs often link social responsibility with corporate self-interest. 
For example, Bayer and Merck, two major pharmaceuticals firms, promote science 
education as a way to enlarge the pool of future employees. Students who visit the 
Bayer Science Forum in Elkhart, Indiana, work alongside scientists conducting a variety 
of experiments. Workshops created by the Merck Institute for Science Education show 
teachers how to put scientific principles into action through hands-on experiments.
These are just a few illustrations from the long list of companies, big and small, 
that attempt to behave in socially responsible ways. In general, people are more likely 
to want to work for and buy from such organizations.
The Evolution of Social Responsibility 
in Business
Business is far from perfect in many respects, but its record of social responsibility 
today is much better than that in past decades. In fact, present demands for social 
responsibility have their roots in outraged reactions to the abusive business practices 
of the early 1900s.
Historical Evolution of Business Social Responsibility
During the first quarter of the 20th century, businesses were free to operate pretty much 
as they chose. Government protection of workers and consumers was minimal. As a 
result, people either accepted what business had to offer or they did without. Working 
conditions often were deplorable by today’s standards. The average workweek in most 
industries exceeded 60 hours, no minimum-wage law existed, and employee benefits 
were almost nonexistent. Work areas were crowded and unsafe, and industrial accidents 
were the rule rather than the exception. To improve working conditions, employees

views on the social 
responsibility of business have 
evolved.

caveat emptor a Latin phrase 
meaning “let the buyer beware”
organized and joined labor unions. During the early 1900s, 
however, businesses—with the help of government—were able to 
use court orders, brute force, and even the few existing antitrust 
laws to defeat union attempts to improve working conditions.
During this period, consumers generally were subject to the 
doctrine of caveat emptor, a Latin phrase meaning “let the buyer 
beware.” In other words, “what you see is what you get,” and if it is 
not what you expected, too bad. Although victims of unscrupulous 
business practices could take legal action, going to court was very 
expensive, and consumers rarely won their cases. Moreover, no con-
sumer groups or government agencies existed to publicize their con-
sumers’ grievances or to hold sellers accountable for their actions.
Before the 1930s, most people believed that competition 
and the action of the marketplace would, in time, correct abuses. 
Government, therefore, became involved in day-to-day business 
activities only in cases of obvious abuse of the free-market system. 
Six of the more important business-related federal laws passed 
between 1887 and 1914 are described in Table 2.2. As you can see, 
these laws were aimed more at encouraging competition than at correcting abuses, 
although two of them did deal with the purity of food and drug products.
The collapse of the stock market on October 29, 1929, triggered the Great 
Depression and years of dire economic problems for the United States. Factory pro-
duction fell by almost half, and up to 25 percent of the nation’s workforce was unem-
ployed. Before long, public pressure mounted for the government to “do something” 
about the economy and about worsening social conditions.
Soon after Franklin D. Roosevelt became president in 1933, he instituted programs to 
restore the economy and improve social conditions. The government passed laws to cor-
rect what many viewed as the monopolistic abuses of big business, and provided various 
social services for individuals. These massive federal programs became the foundation for 
increased government involvement in the dealings between business and society.
As government involvement has increased, so has everyone’s awareness of the 
social responsibility of business. Today’s business owners are concerned about the 
return on their investment, but at the same time most of them demand ethical behav-
ior from employees. In addition, employees demand better working conditions, and 
consumers want safe, reliable products. Various advocacy groups echo these concerns 
and also call for careful consideration of Earth’s delicate ecological balance. Therefore, 
managers must operate in a complex business environment—one in which they are just 
as responsible for their managerial actions as for their actions as individual citizens. 
Interestingly, today’s high-tech and Internet-based firms fare relatively well when it 
comes to environmental issues, worker conditions, the representation of minorities and 
women in upper management, animal testing, and charitable donations.
Breaking away from fossil fuels. Today’s consumers 
are more open to transportation alternatives, such as 
the electric car, because they are concerned about the 
negative impact of gasoline-run vehicles.

Chapter 2   Being Ethical and Socially Responsible

Two Views of Social Responsibility
Government regulation and public awareness are external forces that have increased 
the social responsibility of business. However, business decisions are made within 
the firm—there, social responsibility begins with the attitude of management. Two 
contrasting philosophies, or models, define the range of management attitudes toward 
social responsibility.
The Economic Model
According to the traditional concept of business, a firm exists to produce quality 
goods and services, earn a reasonable profit, and provide jobs. In line with this 
concept, the economic model of social responsibility holds that society will 
benefit most when business is left alone to produce and market profitable products 
that society needs. The economic model has its origins in the 18th century, when 
businesses were owned primarily by entrepreneurs or owner-managers. Competition 
was vigorous among small firms, and short-run profits and survival were the primary  
concerns.
To the manager who adopts this traditional attitude, social responsibility is some-
one else’s job. After all, stockholders invest in a corporation to earn a return on their 
investment, not because the firm is socially responsible, and the firm is legally obligated 
to act in the economic interest of its stockholders. Moreover, profitable firms pay fed-
eral, state, and local taxes that are used to meet the needs of society. Thus, managers 
who concentrate on profit believe that they fulfill their social responsibility indirectly 
through the taxes paid by their firms. As a result, social responsibility becomes the 
problem of the government, various environmental groups, charitable foundations, and 
similar organizations.
The Socioeconomic Model
In contrast, some managers believe that they have a responsibility not only to 
stockholders but also to customers, employees, suppliers, and the general public. This 
broader view is referred to as the socioeconomic model of social responsibility, 
which places emphasis not only on profits but also on the impact of business decisions 
on society.
Recently, increasing numbers of managers and firms have adopted the socio-
economic model, and they have done so for at least three reasons. First, business is 
dominated by the corporate form of ownership, and the corporation is a creation 
of society. If a corporation does not perform as a good citizen, society can and 
will demand changes. Second, many firms have begun to take pride in their social 
responsibility records, among them Starbucks Coffee, Hewlett-Packard, Colgate-
Palmolive, and Coca-Cola. Each of these companies is a winner of a Corporate 
Conscience Award in the areas of environmental concern, responsiveness to employ-
ees, equal opportunity, and community involvement. Of course, many other cor-
porations are much more socially responsible today than they were ten years ago. 
Third, many businesspeople believe that it is in their best interest to take the ini-
tiative in this area. The alternative may be legal action brought against the firm 
by some special-interest group; in such a situation, the firm may lose control of its  
activities.
The Pros and Cons of Social Responsibility
Business owners, managers, customers, and government officials have debated the pros 
and cons of the economic and socioeconomic models for years. Each side seems to have 
four major arguments to reinforce its viewpoint.
Explain the two views on 
the social responsibility of 
business and understand the 
arguments for and against 
increased social responsibility.

economic model of social 
responsibility the view that society 
will benefit most when business is 
left alone to produce and market 
profitable products that society 
needs
socioeconomic model of social 
responsibility the concept that 
business should emphasize not 
only profits but also the impact of 
its decisions on society

Part 1   The Environment of Business
Arguments for Increased Social Responsibility  Proponents of the socioeco-
nomic model maintain that a business must do more than simply seek profits. To sup-
port their position, they offer the following arguments:
	 1.	Because business is a part of our society, it cannot ignore social issues.
	 2.	Business has the technical, financial, and managerial resources needed to tackle 
today’s complex social issues.
	 3.	By helping resolve social issues, business can create a more stable environment for 
long-term profitability.
	 4.	Socially responsible decision making by firms can prevent increased government 
intervention, which would force businesses to do what they fail to do voluntarily.
These arguments are based on the assumption that a business has a responsibility 
not only to its stockholders but also to its customers, employees, suppliers, and the 
general public.
Arguments Against Increased Social Responsibility  Opponents of the socio-
economic model argue that business should do what it does best: earn a profit by 
manufacturing and marketing products that people want. Those who support this 
position argue as follows:
	 1.	Business managers are responsible primarily to stockholders, so management must 
be concerned with providing a return on owners’ investments.
	 2.	Corporate time, money, and talent should be used to maximize profits, not to solve 
society’s problems.
	 3.	Social problems affect society in general, so individual businesses should not be 
expected to solve these problems.
	 4.	Social issues are the responsibility of government officials who are elected for that 
purpose and who are accountable to the voters for their decisions.
These arguments obviously are based on the assumption that the primary objective 
of business is to earn profits and that government and social institutions should deal 
with social problems.
Table 2.3 compares the economic and socioeconomic viewpoints in terms of 
business emphasis. Today, few firms are either purely economic or purely socioeco-
nomic in outlook; most have chosen some middle ground between the two extremes. 
However, our society generally seems to want—and even to expect—some degree 
of social responsibility from business. Thus, within this middle ground, businesses 
are leaning toward the socioeconomic view. In the next several sections, we look 
at some results of this movement in four specific areas: consumerism, employment 
practices, concern for the environment, and implementation of social responsibility 
programs.

Consumerism
Consumerism consists of all activities undertaken to protect the rights of consumers. 
The fundamental issues pursued by the consumer movement fall into three categories: 
environmental protection, product performance 
and safety, and information disclosure. Although 
consumerism has been with us to some extent since the 
early 19th century, the consumer movement became 
stronger in the 1960s. It was then that President John F. 
Kennedy declared that the consumer was entitled to a 
new “Bill of Rights.”
The Six Basic Rights of Consumers
President Kennedy’s Consumer Bill of Rights asserted 
that consumers have a right to safety, to be informed, to 
choose, and to be heard. Two additional rights added since 
1975 are the right to consumer education and the right to 
courteous service. These six rights are the basis of much of the 
consumer-oriented legislation passed during the last 45 years. 
These rights also provide an effective outline of the objectives 
and accomplishments of the consumer movement.
The Right to Safety  The consumers’ right to safety means 
that the products they purchase must be safe for their intended 
use, must include thorough and explicit directions for proper 
use, and must be tested by the manufacturer to ensure product 
quality and reliability. There are several reasons why American 
business firms must be concerned about product safety.
Corrective Actions Can Be Expensive.  Federal agencies, such as the 
Food and Drug Administration and the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission, have the power to force businesses that 
make or sell defective products to take corrective actions. Such actions include offer-
ing refunds, recalling defective products, issuing public warnings, and reimbursing 
consumers—all of which can be expensive.
Increasing Number of Lawsuits.  Business firms also should be aware that consumers and 
the government have been winning an increasing number of product-liability lawsuits 
against sellers of defective products. Moreover, the amount of the awards in these suits 
has been increasing steadily. Fearing the outcome of numerous lawsuits filed around 
the nation, tobacco giants Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds, which for decades had 
denied that cigarettes cause illness, began negotiating in 1997 with state attorneys 
general, plaintiffs’ lawyers, and antismoking activists. The tobacco giants proposed 
sweeping curbs on their sales and advertising practices and the payment of hundreds 
of billions of dollars in compensation.
Consumer Demand.  Yet another major reason for improving product safety is consum-
ers’ demand for safe products. People simply will stop buying a product they believe 
is unsafe or unreliable.
The Right to Be Informed  The right to be informed means  that consumers must 
have access to complete information about a product before they buy it. Detailed 
information about ingredients and nutrition must be provided on food containers, 
information about fabrics and laundering methods must be attached to clothing, 
Discuss the factors that led to 
the consumer movement and 
list some of its results.

Keep these consumer rights in mind when you shop 
around for goods or services, buy something, or have a 
problem with a purchase. You’re entitled to be informed, 
to have choices, to be heard, to buy safe products, to have 
responsive service, and to know your rights.

and lenders must disclose the true cost of borrowing the money 
they make available to customers who purchase merchandise on 
credit.
In addition, manufacturers must inform consumers about the 
potential dangers of using their products. Manufacturers that fail 
to provide such information can be held responsible for personal 
injuries suffered because of their products. For example, Maytag 
provides customers with a lengthy booklet that describes how they 
should use an automatic clothes washer. Sometimes such warnings 
seem excessive, but they are necessary if user injuries (and resulting 
lawsuits) are to be avoided.
The Right to Choose  The right to choose means that consumers 
must have a choice of products, offered by different manufacturers 
and sellers, to satisfy a particular need. The government has done 
its part by encouraging competition through antitrust legislation. 
The greater the competition, the greater is the choice available to 
consumers.
Competition and the resulting freedom of choice provide 
additional benefits for customers by reducing prices. For exam-
ple, when personal computers were introduced, they cost more than $5,000. Thanks 
to intense competition and technological advancements, personal computers today 
can be purchased for less than $500.
The Right to Be Heard  This fourth right means that someone will listen and take 
appropriate action when customers complain. Actually, management began to listen 
to consumers after World War II, when competition between businesses that manufac-
tured and sold consumer goods increased. One way that firms got a competitive edge 
was to listen to consumers and provide the products they said they wanted and needed. 
Today, businesses are listening even more attentively, and many larger firms have con-
sumer relations departments that can be contacted easily via toll-free telephone num-
bers. Other groups listen, too. Most large cities and some states have consumer affairs 
offices to act on citizens’ complaints.
Additional Consumer Rights  In 1975, President Gerald Ford added to the 
Consumer Bill of Rights the right to consumer education, which entitles people to be 
fully informed about their rights as consumers. In 1994, President Bill Clinton added a 
sixth right, the right to service, which entitles consumers to convenience, courtesy, and 
responsiveness from manufacturers and sellers of consumer products.
Major Consumerism Forces
The major forces in consumerism are individual consumer advocates and organizations, 
consumer education programs, and consumer laws. Consumer advocates, such as 
Ralph Nader, take it on themselves to protect the rights of consumers. They band 
together into consumer organizations, either independently or under government 
sponsorship. Some organizations, such as the National Consumers’ League and the 
Consumer Federation of America, operate nationally, whereas others are active at 
state and local levels. They inform and organize other consumers, raise issues, help 
businesses to develop consumer-oriented programs, and pressure lawmakers to enact 
consumer protection laws. Some consumer advocates and organizations encourage 
consumers to boycott products and businesses to which they have objections. Today, 
the consumer movement has adopted corporate-style marketing and addresses a broad 
range of issues. Current campaigns include efforts (1) to curtail the use of animals for 
The right to safety. The Consumer Bill of Rights 
asserts consumers’ basic rights. The right to safety 
means that products must be safe for their intended 
use and must be tested by the processor to ensure 
product quality and safety.

Is Personal Data Really Private?
Nearly everything you do online—from the 
Web sites you visit to the Facebook pages 
you “like”—is being tracked by a business. 
Advertisers want to know about your activities 
so they can show you appropriate online ads; retailers want 
to know what you buy so they can send you targeted e-mails 
and catalogs. But are your personal details really private? 
Although privacy policies are supposed to explain which 
details each Web site collects and who will have access to 
your private data, these policies may not tell the whole 
story. After Facebook changed its privacy policy and then 
reset users’ privacy controls on its own, the Federal Trade 
Commission charged the firm with making “deceptive 
privacy claims.” Users believed their personal details were 
private, yet advertisers and others were allowed access. 
Now, in a settlement with the FTC, Facebook has tightened 
its privacy controls, and its privacy program must be 
monitored for the next 20 years to ensure compliance. The 
FTC also thinks Internet users should be able to opt out 
of online tracking if they choose. Meanwhile, millions of 
individuals have already installed anti-tracking software 
such as Ghostery and Do Not Track Plus for added online 
privacy.

testing purposes, (2) to reduce liquor and cigarette billboard advertising in low-income, 
inner-city neighborhoods, and (3) to encourage recycling.
Educating consumers to make wiser purchasing decisions is perhaps one of the 
most far-reaching aspects of consumerism. Increasingly, consumer education is becom-
ing a part of high school and college curricula and adult-education programs. These 
programs cover many topics—for instance, what major factors should be considered 
when buying specific products, such as insurance, real estate, automobiles, appli-
ances and furniture, clothes, and food; the provisions of certain consumer-protection 
laws; and the sources of information that can help individuals become knowledgeable 
consumers.
Major advances in consumerism have come through federal legislation. Some 
laws enacted in the last 50 years to protect your rights as a consumer are listed and 
described in Table 2.4.
Here is the 2009 list of proposed legislation to protect consumers and investors:16

●Accountability and Transparency in Rating Agencies Act of 2009

Most businesspeople now realize that they ignore consumer issues only at their 
own peril. Managers know that improper handling of consumer complaints can result 
in lost sales, bad publicity, and lawsuits.

Employment Practices
Managers who subscribe to the socioeconomic view of a business’s social responsibility, 
together with significant government legislation enacted to protect the buying public, 
have broadened the rights of consumers. The last five decades have seen similar progress 
in affirming the rights of employees to equal treatment in the workplace.
Everyone should have the opportunity to land a job for which he or she is qualified 
and to be rewarded on the basis of ability and performance. This is an important issue 
for society, and it also makes good business sense. Yet, over the years, this opportunity 
has been denied to members of various minority groups. A minority is a racial, reli-
gious, political, national, or other group regarded as different from the larger group of 
which it is a part and that is often singled out for unfavorable treatment.
The federal government responded to the outcry of minority groups during the 
1960s and 1970s by passing a number of laws forbidding discrimination in the work-
place. (These laws are discussed in Chapter 9 in the context of human resources manage-
ment.) Now, almost 50 years after passage of the first of these (the Civil Rights Act of 
1964), abuses still exist. An example is the disparity in income levels for whites, blacks, 
Hispanics, and Asians, as illustrated in Figure 2.3. Lower incomes and higher unem-
ployment rates also characterize Native Americans, handicapped persons, and women. 
Responsible managers have instituted a number of programs to counteract the results 
of discrimination.
Affirmative Action Programs
An affirmative action program is a plan designed to increase the number of minority 
employees at all levels within an organization. Employers with federal contracts of 
more than $50,000 per year must have written affirmative action plans. The objective 
of such programs is to ensure that minorities are represented within the organization in 
approximately the same proportion as in the surrounding community. If 25 percent of the 
electricians in a geographic area in which a company is located are African-Americans,

then approximately 25 percent of the electricians it employs also should be African-
Americans. Affirmative action plans encompass all areas of human resources 
management: recruiting, hiring, training, promotion, and pay.
Unfortunately, affirmative action programs have been plagued by two prob-
lems. The first involves quotas. In the beginning, many firms pledged to recruit 
and hire a certain number of minority members by a specific date. To achieve 
this goal, they were forced to consider only minority applicants for job openings; 
if they hired nonminority workers, they would be defeating their own purpose. 
However, the courts have ruled that such quotas are unconstitutional even though 
their purpose is commendable. They are, in fact, a form of discrimination called 
reverse discrimination.
The second problem is that although most such programs have been reason-
ably successful, not all businesspeople are in favor of affirmative action programs. 
Managers not committed to these programs can “play the game” and still dis-
criminate against workers. To help solve this problem, Congress created (and later 
strengthened) the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a 
government agency with the power to investigate complaints of employment dis-
crimination and sue firms that practice it.
The threat of legal action has persuaded some corporations to amend their 
hiring and promotional policies, but the discrepancy between men’s and women’s 
salaries still exists, as illustrated in Figure 2.4. For more than 50 years, women 
have consistently earned only about 77 cents for each dollar earned by men.
Training Programs for the Hard-Core Unemployed
For some firms, social responsibility extends far beyond placing a help-wanted 
advertisement in the local newspaper. These firms have assumed the task of helping 
the hard-core unemployed, workers with little education or vocational training and 
a long history of unemployment. For example, a few years ago, General Mills helped 
establish Siyeza, a frozen soul-food processing plant in North Minneapolis. Through the 
years, Siyeza has provided stable, high-quality full-time jobs for a permanent core of 80 
unemployed or underemployed minority inner-city residents. In addition, groups of up

to 100 temporary employees are called in when needed. In the past, such workers often 
were turned down routinely by personnel managers, even for the most menial jobs.
Obviously, such workers require training; just as obviously, this training can be 
expensive and time-consuming. To share the costs, business and community leaders 
have joined together in a number of cooperative programs. One particularly successful 
partnership is the National Alliance of Business (NAB), a joint business–government 
program to train the hard-core unemployed. The alliance’s 5,000 members include 
companies of all sizes and industries, their CEOs and senior executives, as well as edu-
cators and community leaders. NAB, founded in 1968 by President Lyndon Johnson 
and Henry Ford II, is a major national business organization focusing on education 
and workforce issues.
Concern for the Environment
The social consciousness of responsible business managers, the encouragement of 
a concerned government, and an increasing concern on the part of the public have 
led to a major effort to reduce environmental pollution, conserve natural resources, 
and reverse some of the worst effects of past negligence in this area. Pollution is the 
contamination of water, air, or land through the actions of people in an industrialized 
society. For several decades, environmentalists have been warning us about the dangers 
of industrial pollution. Unfortunately, business and government leaders either ignored 
the problem or were not concerned about it until pollution became a threat to life and 
health in America. Today, Americans expect business and government leaders to take 
swift action to clean up our environment—and to keep it clean.
Effects of Environmental Legislation
As in other areas of concern to our society, legislation and regulations play a crucial 
role in pollution control. The laws outlined in Table 2.5 reflect the scope of current 
environmental legislation: laws to promote clean air, clean water, and even quiet work 
and living environments. Of major importance was the creation of the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA), the federal agency charged with enforcing laws designed to 
protect the environment.
When they are aware of a pollution problem, many firms respond to it rather than 
wait to be cited by the EPA. Other owners and managers, however, take the position 
that environmental standards are too strict. (Loosely translated, this means that com-
pliance with present standards is too expensive.) Consequently, it often has been neces-
sary for the EPA to take legal action to force firms to install antipollution equipment 
and to clean up waste storage areas.
Experience has shown that the combination of environmental legislation, vol-
untary compliance, and EPA action can succeed in cleaning up the environment and 
keeping it clean. However, much still remains to be done.
Water Pollution  The Clean Water Act has been credited with greatly improving the 
condition of the waters in the United States. This success comes largely from the con-
trol of pollutant discharges from industrial and wastewater treatment plants. Although 
the quality of our nation’s rivers, lakes, and streams has improved significantly in 
recent years, many of these surface waters remain severely polluted. Currently, one of 
the most serious water-quality problems results from the high level of toxic pollutants 
found in these waters.
Among the serious threats to people posed by water pollutants are respiratory 
irritation, cancer, kidney and liver damage, anemia, and heart failure. Toxic pollutants 
also damage fish and other forms of wildlife. In fish, they cause tumors or reproduc-
tive problems; shellfish and wildlife living in or drinking from toxin-laden waters also 
have suffered genetic defects. Recently, the Pollution Control Board of Kerala in India 
Describe the major types of 
pollution, their causes, and 
their cures.

ordered Coca-Cola to close its major bottling plant. For years, villagers in the nearby 
areas had accused Coke of depleting local groundwater and producing other local pol-
lution. The village council president said, “We are happy that the government is finally 
giving justice to the people who are affected by the plant.”
One of the worst environmental disasters in 2010 was the explosion of the 
Deepwater Horizon, during which 11 people died. The British Petroleum (BP) catas-
trophe led to an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that contaminated a vast area of the 
United States marine environment. It caused a serious impact on wildlife, the local fish-
ing industry, and regional tourism. British Petroleum was held liable for property dam-
aged by the oil spill and the cleanup efforts; loss of income or earning capacity; loss 
of income to boat owners, hotel owners, and restaurant owners; removal and cleanup 
costs of property; and claims of bodily injury caused by the spill. Under the settlement 
in early 2012, British Petroleum expected to pay out $7.8 billion to settle the claims.
The task of water cleanup has proved to be extremely complicated and costly 
because of pollution runoff and toxic contamination. Yet, improved water quality is 
not only necessary, it is also achievable. Consider Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River. A few 
years ago, the river was so contaminated by industrial wastes that it burst into flames 
one hot summer day! Now, after a sustained community cleanup effort, the river is 
pure enough for fish to thrive in.

Another serious issue is acid rain, which is con-
tributing significantly to the deterioration of coastal 
waters, lakes, and marine life in the eastern United 
States. Acid rain forms when sulfur emitted by smoke-
stacks in industrialized areas combines with moisture in 
the atmosphere to form acids that are spread by winds. 
The acids eventually fall to Earth in rain, which finds 
its way into streams, rivers, and lakes. The acid-rain 
problem has spread rapidly in recent years, and experts 
fear that the situation will worsen if the nation begins 
to burn more coal to generate electricity. To solve the 
problem, investigators first must determine where the sulfur is 
being emitted. The costs of this vital investigation and cleanup 
are going to be high. The human costs of having ignored the 
problem so long may be higher still.
Air Pollution  Aviation emissions are a potentially significant 
and growing percentage of greenhouse gases that contribute to 
global warming. Aircraft emissions are significant for several rea-
sons. First, jet aircraft are the main source of human emissions 
deposited directly into the upper atmosphere, where they may 
have a greater warming effect than if they were released at Earth’s 
surface. Second, carbon dioxide—the primary aircraft emis-
sion—is the main focus of international concern. For example, it 
survives in the atmosphere for nearly 100 years and contributes 
to global warming, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change. The carbon dioxide emissions from worldwide 
aviation roughly equal those of some industrialized countries. 
Third, carbon dioxide emissions combined with other gases and 
particles emitted by jet aircraft could have two to four times 
as great an effect on the atmosphere as carbon dioxide alone. 
Fourth, the Intergovernmental Panel recently concluded that the 
rise in aviation emissions owing to the growing demand for air travel would not be fully 
offset by reductions in emissions achieved solely through technological improvements.
Usually, two or three factors combine to form air pollution in any given location. 
The first factor is large amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons emitted by 
motor vehicles concentrated in a relatively small area. The second 
is the smoke and other pollutants emitted by manufacturing facili-
ties. These two factors can be eliminated in part through pollution 
control devices on cars, trucks, and smokestacks.
A third factor that contributes to air pollution—one that can-
not be changed—is the combination of weather and geography. The 
Los Angeles Basin, for example, combines just the right weather 
and geographic conditions for creating dense smog. Los Angeles 
has strict regulations regarding air pollution. Even so, Los Angeles 
still struggles with air pollution problems because of uncontrollable 
conditions.
How effective is air pollution control? The EPA estimates that 
the Clean Air Act and its amendments will eventually result in the 
removal of 56 billion pounds of pollution from the air each year, 
thus measurably reducing lung disease, cancer, and other serious 
health problems caused by air pollution. Other authorities note 
that we have already seen improvement in air quality. A number 
of cities have cleaner air today than they did 30 years ago. Even in 
southern California, bad air-quality days have dropped to less than 
40 days a year, about 60 percent lower than that observed just a 
decade ago. Numerous chemical companies have recognized that

Worsening water and land pollution problem. 
Land pollution is still a serious problem in many 
parts of the country. It is not just the manufacturers 
and service businesses that produce millions of tons 
of waste! We, the individuals in the United States, 
contribute to the waste-disposal problem, too.

they must take responsibility for operating their plants in an environmentally safe 
manner; some now devote considerable capital to purchasing antipollution devices. 
For example, 3M’s pioneering Pollution Prevention Pays (3P) program, designed to 
find ways to avoid the generation of pollutants, marked its 30th anniversary in 2005. 
Since 1975, more than 5,600 employee-driven 3P projects have prevented the genera-
tion of more than 2.2 billion pounds of pollutants and produced first-year savings 
of nearly $1 billion.
Land Pollution  Air and water quality may be improving, but land pollution is still 
a serious problem in many areas. The fundamental issues are (1) how to restore dam-
aged or contaminated land at a reasonable cost and (2) how to protect unpolluted land 
from future damage.
The land pollution problem has been worsening over the past few years because 
modern technology has continued to produce increasing amounts of chemical and 
radioactive waste. U.S. manufacturers produce an estimated 40 to 60 million tons 
of contaminated oil, solvents, acids, and sludge each year. Service businesses, utility 
companies, hospitals, and other industries also dump vast amounts of wastes into the 
environment.
Individuals in the United States contribute to the waste-disposal problem, too. A 
shortage of landfills, owing to stricter regulations, makes garbage disposal a serious 
problem in some areas. Incinerators help to solve the landfill-shortage problem, but 
they bring with them their own problems. They reduce the amount of garbage but also 
leave tons of ash to be buried—ash that often has a higher concentration of toxicity 
than the original garbage. Other causes of land pollution include strip mining of coal, 
nonselective cutting of forests, and development of agricultural land for housing and 
industry.
To help pay the enormous costs of cleaning up land polluted with chemicals and 
toxic wastes, Congress created a $1.6 billion Superfund in 1980. Originally, money 
was to flow into the Superfund from a tax paid by 800 oil and chemical companies 
that produce toxic waste. The EPA was to use the money in the Superfund to finance 
the cleanup of hazardous waste sites across the nation. To replenish the Superfund, the 
EPA had two options: It could sue companies guilty of dumping chemicals at specific 
waste sites, or it could negotiate with guilty companies and thus completely avoid 
the legal system. During the 1980s, officials at the EPA came under fire because they 
preferred negotiated settlements. Critics referred to these settlements as “sweetheart 
deals” with industry. They felt that the EPA should be much more aggressive in reduc-
ing land pollution. Of course, most corporate executives believe that cleanup efficiency 
and quality might be improved if companies were more involved in the process. Many 
firms, including Delphi Automotive Systems Corporation and 3M, have modified or 
halted the production and sale of products that have a negative impact on the environ-
ment. For example, after tests showed that ScotchGard™ does not decompose in the 
environment, 3M announced a voluntary end to production of the 40-year-old prod-
uct, which had generated $300 million in sales.
Noise Pollution  Excessive noise caused by traffic, aircraft, and machinery can do 
physical harm to human beings. Research has shown that people who are exposed 
to loud noises for long periods of time can suffer permanent hearing loss. The Noise 
Control Act of 1972 established noise emission standards for aircraft and airports, rail-
roads, and interstate motor carriers. The act also provided funding for noise research 
at state and local levels.
Noise levels can be reduced by two methods. The source of noise pollution 
can be isolated as much as possible. (Thus, many metropolitan airports are located 
outside the cities.) Engineers can also modify machinery and equipment to reduce 
noise levels. If it is impossible to reduce industrial noise to acceptable levels, work-
ers should be required to wear earplugs to guard them against permanent hearing 
damage.

Who Should Pay for a Clean Environment?
Governments and businesses are spending billions of dollars annually to reduce 
pollution—more than $45 billion to control air pollution, $33 billion to control 
water pollution, and $12 billion to treat hazardous wastes. To make matters worse, 
much of the money required to purify the environment is supposed to come from 
already depressed industries, such as the chemical industry. A few firms have 
discovered that it is cheaper to pay a fine than to install expensive equipment for 
pollution control.
Who, then, will pay for the environmental cleanup? Many business leaders offer 
one answer—tax money should be used to cleanup the environment and to keep 
it clean. They reason that business is not the only source of pollution, so business 
should not be forced to absorb the entire cost of the cleanup. Environmentalists 
disagree. They believe that the cost of proper treatment and disposal of industrial 
wastes is an expense of doing business. In either case, consumers probably will pay 
a large part of the cost—either as taxes or in the form of higher prices for goods 
and services.
Implementing a Program of Social 
Responsibility
A firm’s decision to be socially responsible is a step in the right direction—but only the 
first step. The firm then must develop and implement a program to reach this goal. The 
program will be affected by the firm’s size, financial resources, past record in the area 
of social responsibility, and competition. Above all, however, the program must have 
the firm’s total commitment or it will fail.
Developing a Program of Social Responsibility
An effective program for social responsibility takes time, money, and organization. 
In most cases, developing and implementing such a program will require four steps:

A growing number of young entrepreneurs 
are starting businesses with the goal of using 
their skills for a socially responsible purpose: 
to improve the quality of life for people all over 
the world. Many of these social entrepreneurs are focusing 
on different ways to bring reliable, inexpensive sources of 
electricity to poverty-stricken areas. 
For example, Alan Hurt, John Harkness, Jason Schwebke, 
and Mike Sutarik are members of Team Light Up Africa, which 
won $10,000 in the first Northern Illinois University Social 
Venture Business Plan Competition. Their Zoom Box, currently 
in development, is a low-cost, lightweight generator suitable 
for powering electric lights and charging cell phones in Africa. 
“We’re more than a company and more than a passing idea,” 
says Hurt. “We’re a movement.”
Teenage inventor Eden Full created a rotating solar panel, 
the SunSaluter, that turns to follow the sun throughout the 
day. The improved efficiency increases the amount of solar 
power that can be generated in an earth-friendly manner. Her 
SunSaluter panels are already lighting up two villages in Kenya, 
with more installations on the way. Full’s ingenuity has won her 
social enterprise additional funding to refine and manufacture 
the product on a larger scale.

social audit a comprehensive 
report of what an organization has 
done and is doing with regard to 
social issues that affect it
securing the commitment of top executives, planning, appointing a director, and 
preparing a social audit.
Commitment of Top Executives  Without the support of top executives, any pro-
gram will soon falter and become ineffective. For example, the Boeing Company’s 
Ethics and Business Conduct Committee is responsible for the ethics program. The 
committee is appointed by the Boeing board of directors, and its members include the 
company chairman and CEO, the president and chief operating officer, the presidents 
of the operating groups, and senior vice presidents. As evidence of their commitment 
to social responsibility, top managers should develop a policy statement that outlines 
key areas of concern. This statement sets a tone of positive support and later will serve 
as a guide for other employees as they become involved in the program.
Planning  Next, a committee of managers should be appointed to plan the program. 
Whatever form their plan takes, it should deal with each of the issues described in the 
top managers’ policy statement. If necessary, outside consultants can be hired to help 
develop the plan.
Appointment of a Director  After the social responsibility plan is established, a 
top-level executive should be appointed to implement the organization’s plan. This 
individual should be charged with recommending specific policies and helping indi-
vidual departments to understand and live up to the social responsibilities the firm 
has assumed. Depending on the size of the firm, the director may require a staff to 
handle the program on a day-to-day basis. For example, at the Boeing Company, the 
director of ethics and business conduct administers the ethics and business conduct 
program.
The Social Audit  At specified intervals, the program director should prepare a 
social audit for the firm. A social audit is a comprehensive report of what an organi-
zation has done and is doing with regard to social issues that affect it. This document 
provides the information the firm needs to evaluate and revise its social responsibility 
program. Typical subject areas include human resources, community involvement, the 
quality and safety of products, business practices, and efforts to reduce pollution and 
improve the environment. The information included in a social audit should be as 
accurate and as quantitative as possible, and the audit should reveal both positive and 
negative aspects of the program.
Today, many companies listen to concerned individuals within and outside the 
company. For example, the Boeing Ethics Line listens to and acts on concerns expressed 
by employees and others about possible violations of company policies, laws, or regu-
lations, such as improper or unethical business practices, as well as health, safety, and 
environmental issues. Employees are encouraged to communicate their concerns, as 
well as ask questions about ethical issues. The Ethics Line is available to all Boeing 
employees, including Boeing subsidiaries. It is also available to concerned individuals 
outside the company.
Funding the Program
We have noted that social responsibility costs money. Thus, just like any other corporate 
undertaking, a program to improve social responsibility must be funded. Funding can 
come from three sources:
	 1.	Management can pass the cost on to consumers in the form of higher prices.
	 2.	The corporation may be forced to absorb the cost of the program if, for example, 
the competitive situation does not permit a price increase. In this case, the cost is 
treated as a business expense, and profit is reduced.
	 3.	The federal government may pay for all or part of the cost through tax reductions 
or other incentives.

Understand what is meant 
by business ethics.
Ethics is the study of right and wrong and of the morality of 
choices. Business ethics is the application of moral standards 
to business situations.
Identify the types of ethical concerns that arise in 
the business world.
Ethical issues arise often in business situations out of 
relationships with investors, customers, employees, creditors, 
or competitors. Businesspeople should make every effort to 
be fair, to consider the welfare of customers and others within 
the firm, to avoid conflicts of interest, and to communicate 
honestly.
Discuss the factors that affect the level of ethical 
behavior in organizations.
Individual, social, and opportunity factors all affect the level 
of ethical behavior in an organization. Individual factors 
include knowledge level, moral values and attitudes, and 
personal goals. Social factors include cultural norms and 
the actions and values of co-workers and significant others. 
Opportunity factors refer to the amount of leeway that exists 
in an organization for employees to behave unethically if 
they choose to do so.

Explain how ethical decision making can be 
encouraged.
Governments, trade associations, and individual firms 
can establish guidelines for defining ethical behavior. 
Governments can pass stricter regulations. Trade associations 
provide ethical guidelines for their members. Companies 
provide codes of ethics—written guides to acceptable and 
ethical behavior as defined by an organization—and create 
an atmosphere in which ethical behavior is encouraged. An 
ethical employee working in an unethical environment may 
resort to whistle-blowing to bring a questionable practice to 
light.
Describe how our current views on the social 
responsibility of business have evolved.
In a socially responsible business, management realizes that 
its activities have an impact on society and considers that 
impact in the decision-making process. Before the 1930s, 
workers, consumers, and government had very little influence 
on business activities; as a result, business leaders gave 
little thought to social responsibility. All this changed with 
the Great Depression. Government regulations, employee 
demands, and consumer awareness combined to create a 
demand that businesses act in socially responsible ways.
Explain the two views on the social responsibility 
of business and understand the arguments for 
and against increased social responsibility.
The basic premise of the economic model of social 
responsibility is that society benefits most when business 
is left alone to produce profitable goods and services.

Panera Cares is very much like every other Panera 
­bakery-café, offering the same seasonal menu, the same 
fresh-baked bread, and the same comfortable ambi-
ance. At Panera Cares, however, customers pay what 
they can afford. A mother with a toddler in tow may 
donate $5 for a pastry while a homeless person pays 
nothing for the same type of pastry. It’s Panera’s way of 
doing something for local communities, and it’s starting 
to catch on.
Panera Cares must receive 80 percent of the sug-
gested funding level to continue as a viable venture. Some 
of the cafés consistently achieve that level, while others fall 
short on some days. As word spreads and more customers 
understand what Panera is trying to achieve, the cafés are 
building a loyal and generous following. “The lesson here is 
that most people are fundamentally good,” notes Panera’s 
founder. “People step up and they do the right thing.”
Questions
1.	 How does Panera Cares fit into the socioeconomic 
model of social responsibility?
2.	 What ethical issues are raised by the idea of expecting 
some people to pay more for a Panera meal so that 
others can pay less?

Part 1   The Environment of Business
According to the socioeconomic model, business has as 
much responsibility to society as it has to its owners. Most 
managers adopt a viewpoint somewhere between these two 
extremes.
Discuss the factors that led to the consumer 
movement and list some of its results.
Consumerism consists of all activities undertaken to protect 
the rights of consumers. The consumer movement generally 
has demanded—and received—attention from business in the 
areas of product safety, product information, product choices 
through competition, and the resolution of complaints about 
products and business practices. Although concerns over 
consumer rights have been around to some extent since the 
early 19th century, the movement became more powerful 
in the 1960s when President John F. Kennedy initiated the 
Consumer Bill of Rights. The six basic rights of consumers 
include the right to safety, the right to be informed, the right 
to choose, the right to be heard, and the rights to consumer 
education and courteous service.
Analyze how present employment practices are 
being used to counteract past abuses.
Legislation and public demand have prompted some businesses 
to correct past abuses in employment practices—mainly with 
regard to minority groups. Affirmative action and training of 
the hard-core unemployed are two types of programs that 
have been used successfully.
Describe the major types of pollution, their 
causes, and their cures.
Industry has contributed to noise pollution and pollution of 
our land and water through the dumping of wastes, and to 
air pollution through vehicle and smokestack emissions. This 
contamination can be cleaned up and controlled, but the big 
question is: Who will pay? Present cleanup efforts are funded 
partly by government tax revenues, partly by business, and in 
the long run by consumers.
Identify the steps a business must take to 
implement a program of social responsibility.
A program to implement social responsibility in a business 
begins with total commitment by top management. The 
program should be planned carefully, and a capable director 
should be appointed to implement it. Social audits should 
be prepared periodically as a means of evaluating and 
revising the program. Programs may be funded through price 
increases, reduction of profit, or federal incentives.

	 4.	 Why should business take on the task of training the hard-
core unemployed?
	 5.	 To what extent should the blame for vehicular air pollution 
be shared by manufacturers, consumers, and government?
	 6.	 Why is there so much government regulation involving social 
responsibility issues? Should there be less?
Discussion Questions
Signs of green marketing can be found everywhere today: reus-
able shopping bags are the rule rather than the exception, organic 
and natural products fill grocers’ shelves, and socially respon-
sible companies are increasing their efforts to reduce pollution, 
conserve water and energy, and recycle waste paper, plastic, and 
other reusable materials.
Of course, some companies have always been ahead of the 
curve. Since the early 1970s, Honda has been producing the 
low-emissions, fuel-efficient Civic model, and the company has 
never strayed from its roots. Today’s Honda line consists of four 
classes of vehicles: Good, Better, Best, and Ultimate. Its regular 
gas cars are Good, with about 30 mpg; hybrids are Better at 
about 45 mpg; and its Best solution is a natural gas-powered 
Civic GX, which gets about 220 miles to a tank. Honda also has 
Ultimate solutions in the works, such as the new Honda FCX 
Clarity—a hydrogen fuel-cell car that uses hydrogen and oxygen 
to create electricity. Although the Civic GX and Clarity models 
are available to consumers, neither vehicle is practical for the 
average driver as fueling stations are scarce.
Alternative energy vehicles are making their way to the 
Midwest. Lee Lindquist, an alternative fuels specialist at 
Scholfield Honda in Wichita, Kansas, was researching alternative 
fuel vehicles for a local Sierra Club meeting when he learned that 
municipalities in New York and California used the natural gas 
Civic GX to address air-quality issues. Although Lee recognized 
that his own Wichita market was not teeming with green con-
sumers, he knew that people needed ways to combat rising fuel 
prices—so he proposed the Civic GX for use at his dealership.
Lee’s boss was skeptical of the idea. Although management 
was open to clever ways to promote the dealership, owner Roger 
Scholfield did not want to risk muddying the waters with a new 
and somewhat impractical vehicle. Nevertheless, he agreed to 
offer the car to his fleet and corporate customers, and in time fate 
offered another opportunity for Scholfield Honda to go green.
In May 2007, a devastating tornado hit the nearby town of 
Greensburg, Kansas, leveling the area. Once again Lee Lindquist 
approached his boss. This time, he proposed donating both a 
Honda Civic GX and a natural-gas fueling station to Greensburg 
as a way of helping the town rebuild. Upon careful reflection, 
Roger realized that Lee’s idea would benefit his dealership 
through good publicity and higher awareness of alternative fuel 
vehicles. Scholfield made the Civic model and fuel station avail-
able to Greensburg residents free of charge, and the dealership 
has been on the green bandwagon ever since.
Although there are more cost-effective ways of advertising, 
Roger Scholfield notes that customers are becoming more 
interested in alternative fuel vehicles since he donated the Civic 
GX. In addition, his dealership has generated plenty of good-
will in the press and among local residents—Scholfield Honda 
has developed a good reputation for its commitment to the 
environment and the people of Greensburg, even opening a 
“Honda Green Zone” conference room on the premises. The 
room can hold several hundred people. It includes a digital 
projector, sound system, and kitchenette and is available free 
to local firms and organizations for meetings and conferences. 
Its chairs, tables, tiles, and flooring are all made from recycled 
materials.17
Questions
1.	 How would you rate Scholfield Honda’s sense of social 
responsibility? Does the dealership meet all the criteria for a 
socially responsible company?
2.	 What is Scholfield Honda’s primary ethical responsibility in 
situations where a proposed green initiative is cost-prohibitive 
or even detrimental to the company’s bottom line?
3.	 Should the government regulate companies’ claims that their 
products are green? Should official classifications for environ-
mental friendliness be defined?

Part 1   The Environment of Business
Can a corporate giant build its business on the basis of being 
green and clean? By 2020, Unilever aims to double its revenues 
while cutting its environmental footprint in half and educating 
one billion people about how to live healthier lives. Although 
these are aggressive goals, the Anglo-Dutch company has consid-
erable resources available to implement its plans. Unilever rings 
up $62 billion in annual sales of a wide range of foods, house-
hold cleaners, and personal care products under such well-known 
brands as Axe, Ben & Jerry’s, Dove, Lipton, Lifebuoy, Skippy, 
Suave, and Surf. It has 170,000 employees and operates in 100 
countries, with more than half of its revenues coming from devel-
oping nations. Every day, all over the world, 2 billion people use 
one (or more) of its products. 
Unilever’s managers see great profit potential in actively man-
aging the environmental and social impacts of its products to 
meet the needs of consumers in all markets and at all income 
levels. “We are advocating a business model that gives to the envi-
ronment and society,” explains CEO Paul Polman. “That is the 
essence of sustainable growth.” 
Before setting specific green and clean goals, Unilever’s managers 
spent years studying the eco-effects of its products and talking with 
customers, suppliers, government officials, and non-profit special-
ists about population growth, natural resources, and human health. 
They set up programs to develop and test efficient, eco-friendly ways 
of manufacturing products and obtaining raw materials. They also 
took a close look at how they might address challenges such as pro-
viding clean drinking water for billions of people and preventing the 
spread of disease. 
Out of this research came a comprehensive plan called the 
Unilever Sustainable Living Plan. It included a detailed timeline for 
dramatically reducing Unilever’s energy and water usage, getting 
raw materials from sustainable sources, and slashing emissions and 
waste. As one example, the company set a deadline for obtaining all 
of its palm oil from certified sustainable sources (and achieved that 
goal three years early). Meanwhile, Unilever’s product development 
experts began devising new products to address common consumer 
needs in earth-friendly ways. For example, for areas where water is 
scarce, they developed a shampoo to be used without water and 
laundry products that clean with a single rinse. 
Unilever’s research also pointed to the need for educating con-
sumers about simple steps they can take to stay healthy, such as 
washing their hands. The company found that the first step is to 
explain why people should take a particular action (wash with soap 
to stop disease from spreading). Next, show them how easy it is to 
take action (by buying and using soap), outline the benefits (keep-
ing families safe from germs), and make them feel good about 
taking action (to keep family members healthy). Finally, encourage 
people to continue this action over and over again (for example, 
by reminding children to wash before meals). Following these five 
steps, Unilever has already educated 35 million people in developing 
nations about the benefits of washing hands—while promoting the 
company’s Lifebuoy soap brand at the same time. 
In the process of moving toward its sustainability goals, Unilever 
has developed tools and techniques that it is now sharing with other 
companies and with suppliers. Its free, downloadable Cool Farm Tool, 
for instance, enables farmers to calculate the level of greenhouse gas 
emissions from their farming and livestock activities. Using this calcu-
lation as a baseline, farmers can then experiment with different ways 
of reducing emissions while improving agricultural yield. This is yet 
another way that the company’s plan “can unleash innovation which 
will help us grow,” says the head of Unilever’s business in India.18
Questions
1.	 Every year, Unilever posts on its web site and distributes to the 
media a report detailing its progress toward the 2020 sustain-
ability goals. Why would the public be interested in such a 
report?
2.	 Is Unilever applying the economic or the socioeconomic model of 
social responsibility? How do you know?
3.	 Do you agree with Unilever’s approach of promoting its Lifebuoy 
soap brand in programs to teach consumers about hand- 
washing? Explain your answer.
Case 2.2
Unilever’s Plan for Green and 
Clean Growth
1 	SOCIAL MEDIA EXERCISE 
In 2010, Pepsi decided to develop a new social media–based proj-
ect, called Pepsi Refresh Project, aimed at Millennials and allow-
ing consumers to post ideas for improving their communities. This 
replaced the $20 million they spent on Superbowl advertising. The 
project received more than 57 million votes. However, the general 
consensus was this was not a successful program for Pepsi. Using 
the Internet for research, answer the following questions:
1.	 Why do you think the Pepsi Refresh Project was not as suc-
cessful as the company hoped?
2.	 Do you think this is a good example of corporate social 
responsibility (CSR)? Why or why not?
3.	 How does this CSR example for Pepsi compare with that of its 
main rival Coca-Cola (see www.thecoca-colacompany.com/
citizenship/index.html)?

Chapter 2   Being Ethical and Socially Responsible	
67
2 	JOURNALING FOR SUCCESS
Discovery statement: This chapter was devoted mostly to busi-
ness ethics, ethical concerns that arise in the business world, per-
sonal ethics, and social responsibility of business.
Assume that you are an accountant at ABC Corporation, 
where you question the company’s accounting practices. What 
legal and managerial changes would you suggest to prevent the 
use of accounting tricks to manipulate corporate earnings?
Assignment
1.	 Assume that your manager refuses to incorporate any of your 
suggestions. Would you blow the whistle? Why or why not?
2.	 Suppose that you blow the whistle and get fired. Which law 
might protect your rights, and how would you proceed to 
protect yourself?
3 	DEVELOPING CRITICAL-THINKING SKILLS
Recently, an article entitled “Employees Coming to Terms with 
Moral Issues on the Job” appeared in a big-city newspaper. It 
posed the following situations:
●
●
You are asked to work on a project you find morally wrong.
●
●
Important tasks are left undone because a co-worker spends 
more time planning a social event than working on a proposal.
●
●
Your company is knowingly selling defective merchandise to 
customers.
Unfortunately, many employees currently are struggling with 
such issues. The moral dilemmas that arise when employees find 
their own ethical values incompatible with the work they do every 
day are causing a lot of stress in the workplace, and furthermore, 
these dilemmas are not being discussed. There exists an eth-
ics gap. You already may have faced a similar situation in your 
­workplace.
Assignment
1.	 In small groups with your classmates, discuss your answers to 
the following questions:
a.	 If you were faced with any of the preceding situations, 
what would you do?
b.	 Would you complete work you found morally unaccept-
able, or would you leave it undone and say nothing?
c.	 If you spoke up, what would happen to you or your 
career? What would be the risk?
d.	 What are your options?
e.	 If you were a manager rather than a lower-level employee, 
would you feel differently and take a different approach to 
the issue? Why?
2.	 In a written report, summarize what you learned from this 
­discussion.
4 	BUILDING TEAM SKILLS
A firm’s code of ethics outlines the kinds of behaviors expected 
within the organization and serves as a guideline for encourag-
ing ethical behavior in the workplace. It reflects the rights of the 
firm’s workers, shareholders, and consumers.
Assignment
1.	 Working in a team of four, find a code of ethics for a business 
firm. Start the search by asking firms in your community for a 
copy of their codes, by visiting the library, or by searching and 
downloading information from the Internet.
2.	 Analyze the code of ethics you have chosen, and answer the 
following questions:
a.	 What does the company’s code of ethics say about the 
rights of its workers, shareholders, consumers, and sup-
pliers? How does the code reflect the company’s attitude 
toward competitors?
b.	 How does this code of ethics resemble the information 
discussed in this chapter? How does it differ?
c.	 As an employee of this company, how would you personally 
interpret the code of ethics? How might the code influence 
your behavior within the workplace? Give several examples.
5 	RESEARCHING DIFFERENT CAREERS
Business ethics has been at the heart of many discussions over 
the years and continues to trouble employees and shareholders. 
Stories about dishonesty and wrongful behavior in the workplace 
appear on a regular basis in newspapers and on the national news.
Assignment
Prepare a written report on the following:
1.	 Why can it be so difficult for people to do what is right?
2.	 What is your personal code of ethics? Prepare a code outlin-
ing what you believe is morally right. The document should 
include guidelines for your personal behavior.
3.	 How will your code of ethics affect your decisions about:
a.	 The types of questions you should ask in a job interview?
b.	 Selecting a company in which to work?

Part 1   The Environment of Business
Volkswagen Speeds Along on Global Sales
Volkswagen is shifting into high gear to become the world’s largest and most profitable 
automaker by 2018. The company, based in Germany, sells vehicles in 150 nations under 
many brands, including Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche, Scania, Seat, Skoda, 
and Volkswagen. Although Volkswagen is strongest on its home continent of Europe, it’s 
been steering toward higher sales in Asia and the Americas for years.
	
Nearly 30 years ago, Volkswagen was among the first major automakers to do busi-
ness in China. It has joined forces with two local partners, SAIC and FAW, to build and 
market cars all around the country. Originally, the cars Volkswagen made with its Chinese 
partners were no-frills, low-price models. Now, in addition to these basic cars, Volkswagen 
is introducing larger, more stylish (and more profitable) cars designed especially for China, 
such as the VW Lavida.   
	
Volkswagen imports some of its cars from Germany and makes some in its new high-tech 
factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Having most of the parts supplied by United States–
based companies or German firms with U.S. divisions allows Volkswagen to keep costs down, 
so it can price its made-in-America cars more competitively. Having a strong U.S. presence 
will help Volkswagen achieve its goal of becoming the industry leader by 2018, despite 
aggressive moves by U.S. rivals such as General Motors and global rivals such as Toyota and 
Hyundai. “You have to be successful in the United States if you want to be the number one in 
the industry,” says Volkswagen’s chief executive officer. “Trends are set in America, not just 
for consumer behavior but also for communication technology, computers, and software.”
	
Sales are also growing in South America, where Volkswagen operates eight factories 
to make the compact Gol car, a popular line of minibuses, and other vehicles. The firm has 
an engine factory and an assembly plant in Mexico, as well, as part of its long-term plan to 
increase production and boost sales in both North and South America. 
	
Two factors that might slow Volkswagen’s drive for global growth are economic uncer-
tainties and intense competition. Can the company continue accelerating toward higher 
sales?1
FYI
Did You Know? 
Volkswagen has invested $1 
billion to build a state-of-the-art 
factory in Chattanooga as part of 
its quest to become the world’s 
top-selling automaker by 2018.
Inside
Business
V
olkswagen is just one of a growing number of foreign companies, large and 
small, that are doing business with firms in other countries. Some compa-
nies, such as Coca-Cola, sell to firms in other countries; others, such as Pier 1 
Imports, buy goods around the world to import into the United States. Whether they 
buy or sell products across national borders, these companies are all contributing to 
the volume of international trade that is fueling the global economy.
Theoretically, international trade is every bit as logical and worthwhile as inter-
state trade between, say, California and Washington. Yet, nations tend to restrict the 
import of certain goods for a variety of reasons. For example, in the early 2000s, 
the United States restricted the import of Mexican fresh tomatoes because they were 
undercutting price levels of domestic fresh tomatoes.
Despite such restrictions, international trade has increased almost steadily since 
World War II. Many of the industrialized nations have signed trade agreements intended 
to eliminate problems in international business and to help less-developed nations par-
ticipate in world trade. Individual firms around the world have seized the opportunity 
to compete in foreign markets by exporting products and increasing foreign production, 
as well as by other means.

Chapter 3   Exploring Global Business	
71
Signing the Trade Act of 2002, President George W. Bush remarked, “Trade is an 
important source of good jobs for our workers and a source of higher growth for our 
economy. Free trade is also a proven strategy for building global prosperity and add-
ing to the momentum of political freedom. Trade is an engine of economic growth. In 
our lifetime, trade has helped lift millions of people and whole nations out of poverty 
and put them on the path of prosperity.”2 In his national best seller, The World Is Flat, 
Thomas L. Friedman states, “The flattening of the world has presented us with new 
opportunities, new challenges, new partners but, also, alas new dangers, particularly as 
Americans it is imperative that we be the best global citizens that we can be—because 
in a flat world, if you don’t visit a bad neighborhood, it might visit you.”
We describe international trade in this chapter in terms of modern specialization, 
whereby each country trades the surplus goods and services it produces most efficiently 
for products in short supply. We also explain the restrictions nations place on products 
and services from other countries and present some of the possible advantages and 
disadvantages of these restrictions. We then describe the extent of international trade 
and identify the organizations working to foster it. We describe several methods of 
entering international markets and the various sources of export assistance available 
from the federal government. Finally, we identify some of the institutions that provide 
the complex financing necessary for modern international trade.
The Basis for International Business
International business encompasses all business activities that involve exchanges 
across national boundaries. Thus, a firm is engaged in international business when 
it buys some portion of its input from, or sells some portion of its output to, an 
organization located in a foreign country. (A small retail store may sell goods produced 
in some other country. However, because it purchases these goods from American 
distributors, it is not engaged in international trade.)
Absolute and Comparative Advantage
Some countries are better equipped than others to produce particular goods or services. 
The reason may be a country’s natural resources, its labor supply, or even customs 
or a historical accident. Such a country would be best off if it could specialize in 
the production of such products so that it can produce them most efficiently. The 
country could use what it needed of these products and then trade 
the surplus for products it could not produce efficiently on its own.
Saudi Arabia thus has specialized in the production of crude oil 
and petroleum products; South Africa, in diamonds; and Australia, 
in wool. Each of these countries is said to have an absolute advan-
tage with regard to a particular product. An absolute advantage 
is the ability to produce a specific product more efficiently than any 
other nation.
One country may have an absolute advantage with regard to 
several products, whereas another country may have no absolute 
advantage at all. Yet it is still worthwhile for these two countries to 
specialize and trade with each other. To see why this is so, imagine 
that you are the president of a successful manufacturing firm and 
that you can accurately type 90 words per minute. Your assistant 
can type 80 words per minute but would run the business poorly. 
Thus, you have an absolute advantage over your assistant in both 
typing and managing. However, you cannot afford to type your 
own letters because your time is better spent in managing the busi-
ness. That is, you have a comparative advantage in managing. A 
comparative advantage is the ability to produce a specific product 
more efficiently than any other product.
Explain the economic basis 
for international business.

Exploiting an American advantage. The United 
States has long specialized in the production of wheat. 
Because of its natural resource, the United States and 
some other countries enjoy an absolute advantage—
their ability to produce wheat more efficiently than 
countries in other parts of the world.

Part 1   The Environment of Business
Your assistant, on the other hand, has a comparative advantage in typing because 
he or she can do that better than managing the business. Thus, you spend your time 
managing, and you leave the typing to your assistant. Overall, the business is run as 
efficiently as possible because you are each working in accordance with your own 
comparative advantage.
The same is true for nations. Goods and services are produced more efficiently 
when each country specializes in the products for which it has a comparative 
advantage. Moreover, by definition, every country has a comparative advantage in 
some product. The United States has many comparative advantages—in research 
and development, high-technology industries, and identifying new markets, for 
instance.
Exporting and Importing
Suppose that the United States specializes in producing corn. It then will produce 
a surplus of corn, but perhaps it will have a shortage of wine. France, on the other 
hand, specializes in producing wine but experiences a shortage of corn. To satisfy both 
needs—for corn and for wine—the two countries should trade with each other. The 
United States should export corn and import wine. France should export wine and 
import corn.
Exporting is selling and shipping raw materials or products to other nations. The 
Boeing Company, for example, exports its airplanes to a number of countries for use 
by their airlines. Figure 3.1 shows the top ten merchandise-exporting states in this 
country.
Importing is purchasing raw materials or products in other nations and bringing 
them into one’s own country. Thus, buyers for Macy’s department stores may purchase 
rugs in India or raincoats in England and have them shipped back to the United States 
for resale.
Texas and California accounted for over one-fourth  
of all 2011 U.S. merchandise exports.

Importing and exporting are the principal activities in international trade. They 
give rise to an important concept called the balance of trade. A nation’s balance of 
trade is the total value of its exports minus the total value of its imports over some 
period of time. If a country imports more than it exports, its balance of trade is nega-
tive and is said to be unfavorable. (A negative balance of trade is unfavorable because 
the country must export money to pay for its excess imports.)
In 2011, the United States imported $2,661 billion worth of goods and services 
and exported $2,103 billion worth. It thus had a trade deficit of $558 billion. A trade 
deficit is a negative balance of trade (see Figure 3.2). However, the United States has 
consistently enjoyed a large and rapidly growing surplus in services. For example, in 
2011, the United States imported $426 billion worth of services and exported $605 
billion worth, thus creating a favorable balance of $179 billion.3

If a country imports more goods than it exports, the balance of trade is negative, as  
it was in the United States from 1987 to 2011.

Part 1   The Environment of Business
Question: Are trade deficits bad?
Answer: In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, Daniel T. Griswold, 
associate director of the Center for Trade Policy at the Cato Institute, remarked, “The 
trade deficit is not a sign of economic distress, but of rising domestic demand and 
investment. Imposing new trade barriers will only make Americans worse off while 
leaving the trade deficit virtually unchanged.”
On the other hand, when a country exports more than it imports, it is said to have 
a favorable balance of trade. This has consistently been the case for Japan over the last 
two decades or so.
A nation’s balance of payments is the total flow of money into a country minus 
the total flow of money out of that country over some period of time. Balance of pay-
ments, therefore, is a much broader concept than balance of trade. It includes imports 
and exports, of course. However, it also includes investments, money spent by foreign 
tourists, payments by foreign governments, aid to foreign governments, and all other 
receipts and payments.
A continual deficit in a nation’s balance of payments (a negative balance) can cause 
other nations to lose confidence in that nation’s economy. Alternatively, a continual 
surplus may indicate that the country encourages exports but limits imports by impos-
ing trade restrictions.
Restrictions to International Business
Specialization and international trade can result in the efficient production 
of want-satisfying goods and services on a worldwide basis. As we have noted, 
international business generally is increasing. Yet the nations of the world continue 
to erect barriers to free trade. They do so for reasons ranging from internal political 
and economic pressures to simple mistrust of other nations. We examine first the 
types of restrictions that are applied and then the arguments for and against trade 
restrictions.

Types of Trade Restrictions
Nations generally are eager to export their products. They want to provide markets 
for their industries and to develop a favorable balance of trade. Hence, most trade 
restrictions are applied to imports from other nations.
Tariffs  Perhaps the most commonly applied trade restriction is the customs (or 
import) duty. An import duty (also called a tariff) is a tax levied on a particu-
lar foreign product entering a country. For example, the United States imposes a  
2.2 percent import duty on fresh Chilean tomatoes, an 8.7 percent duty if tomatoes 
are dried and packaged, and nearly 12 percent if tomatoes are made into ketchup or 
salsa. The two types of tariffs are revenue tariffs and protective tariffs; both have the 
effect of raising the price of the product in the importing nations, but for different 
reasons. Revenue tariffs are imposed solely to generate income for the government. 
For example, the United States imposes a duty on Scotch whiskey solely for revenue 
purposes. Protective tariffs, on the other hand, are imposed to protect a domestic 
industry from competition by keeping the price of competing imports level with 
or higher than the price of similar domestic products. Because fewer units of the 
product will be sold at the increased price, fewer units will be imported. The French 
and Japanese agricultural sectors would both shrink drastically if their nations 
abolished the protective tariffs that keep the price of imported farm products high. 
Today, U.S. tariffs are the lowest in history, with average tariff rates on all imports 
under 3 percent.
Some countries rationalize their protectionist policies as a way of offsetting an 
international trade practice called dumping. Dumping is the exportation of large 
quantities of a product at a price lower than that of the same product in the home 
market.
Thus, dumping drives down the price of the domestic item. Recently, for exam-
ple, the Pencil Makers Association, which represents eight U.S. pencil manufacturers, 
charged that low-priced pencils from Thailand and the People’s Republic of China 
were being sold in the United States at less than fair value prices. Unable to compete 
with these inexpensive imports, several domestic manufacturers had to shut down. 
To protect themselves, domestic manufacturers can obtain an antidumping duty 
through the government to offset the advantage of the foreign product. Recently, for 
example, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed antidumping duties of up to 
99 percent on a variety of steel products imported from China, 
following allegations by U.S. Steel Corp. and other producers that 
the products were being dumped at unfair prices.
Nontariff Barriers  A nontariff barrier is a nontax measure 
imposed by a government to favor domestic over foreign suppli-
ers. Nontariff barriers create obstacles to the marketing of foreign 
goods in a country and increase costs for exporters. The following 
are a few examples of government-imposed nontariff barriers:
●
●An import quota is a limit on the amount of a particular good 
that may be imported into a country during a given period of 
time. The limit may be set in terms of either quantity (so many 
pounds of beef) or value (so many dollars’ worth of shoes). 
Quotas also may be set on individual products imported from 
specific countries. Once an import quota has been reached, 
imports are halted until the specified time has elapsed.
●
●An embargo is a complete halt to trading with a particular 
nation or of a particular product. The embargo is used most 
often as a political weapon. At present, the United States has 
import embargoes against Iran and North Korea—both as a 
result of extremely poor political relations.

Restricting the trade: The Russian style. In early 
2012, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov speaks 
at a news conference in Moscow, Russia. Mr. Lavrov 
threatens that Moscow will not abide by its World 
Trade Organization’s commitments in trade with the 
United States unless it scraps a Cold War trade law.

Part 1   The Environment of Business
●
●A foreign-exchange control is a restriction on the 
amount of a particular foreign currency that can be 
purchased or sold. By limiting the amount of foreign 
currency importers can obtain, a government limits the 
amount of goods importers can purchase with that cur-
rency. This has the effect of limiting imports from the 
country whose foreign exchange is being controlled.
●
●A nation can increase or decrease the value of its money 
relative to the currency of other nations. Currency 
devaluation is the reduction of the value of a nation’s 
currency relative to the currencies of other countries.
Devaluation increases the cost of foreign goods, whereas 
it decreases the cost of domestic goods to foreign firms. For 
example, suppose that the British pound is worth $2. In this 
case, an American-made $2,000 computer can be purchased 
for £1,000. However, if the United Kingdom devalues the 
pound so that it is worth only $1, that same computer will cost 
£2,000. The increased cost, in pounds, will reduce the import 
of American computers—and all foreign goods—into England.
On the other hand, before devaluation, a £500 set of English 
bone china will cost an American $1,000. After the devaluation, 
the set of china will cost only $500. The decreased cost will 
make the china—and all English goods—much more attractive 
to U.S. purchasers. Bureaucratic red tape is more subtle than the 
other forms of nontariff barriers. Yet it can be the most frustrat-
ing trade barrier of all. A few examples are the unnecessarily 
restrictive application of standards and complex requirements 
related to product testing, labeling, and certification.
Cultural Barriers  Another type of nontariff barrier is related 
to cultural attitudes. Cultural barriers can impede acceptance of 
products in foreign countries. For example, illustrations of feet 
are regarded as despicable in Thailand. Even so simple a thing as 
the color of a product or its package can present a problem. In 
Japan, black and white are the colors of mourning, so they should 
not be used in packaging. In Brazil, purple is the color of death. 
And in Egypt, green is never used on a package because it is the 
national color. When customers are unfamiliar with particular products from another 
country, their general perceptions of the country itself affect their attitude toward the 
product and help to determine whether they will buy it. Because Mexican cars have not 
been viewed by the world as being quality products, Volkswagen, for example, may not 
want to advertise that some of its models sold in the United States are made in Mexico. 
Many retailers on the Internet have yet to come to grips with the task of designing an 
online shopping site that is attractive and functional for all global customers.
Gifts to authorities—sometimes quite large ones—may be standard business pro-
cedure in some countries. In others, including the United States, they are called bribes 
or payoffs and are strictly illegal.
Reasons for Trade Restrictions
Various reasons are given for trade restrictions either on the import of specific products 
or on trade with particular countries. We have noted that political considerations 
usually are involved in trade embargoes. Other frequently cited reasons for restricting 
trade include the following:
●
●To equalize a nation’s balance of payments. This may be considered necessary to 
restore confidence in the country’s monetary system and in its ability to repay its debts.

●
●To protect new or weak industries. A new, or infant, industry may not be strong 
enough to withstand foreign competition. Temporary trade restrictions may be 
used to give it a chance to grow and become self-sufficient. The problem is that 
once an industry is protected from foreign competition, it may refuse to grow, 
and “temporary” trade restrictions will become permanent. For example, a recent 
report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the congressional inves-
tigative agency, has accused the federal government of routinely imposing quotas 
on foreign textiles without “demonstrating the threat of serious damage” to U.S. 
industry. The GAO said that the Committee for the Implementation of Textile 
Agreements sometimes applies quotas even though it cannot prove the textile 
industry’s claims that American companies have been hurt or jobs have been 
eliminated.
●
●To protect national security. Restrictions in this category generally apply to tech-
nological products that must be kept out of the hands of potential enemies. For 
example, strategic and defense-related goods cannot be exported to unfriendly 
nations.
●
●To protect the health of citizens. Products may be embargoed because they are 
dangerous or unhealthy (e.g., farm products contaminated with insecticides).
●
●To retaliate for another nation’s trade restrictions. A country whose exports are 
taxed by another country may respond by imposing tariffs on imports from that 
country.
●
●To protect domestic jobs. By restricting imports, a nation can protect jobs in 
domestic industries. However, protecting these jobs can be expensive. For exam-
ple, protecting 9,000 jobs in the U.S. carbon-steel industry costs $6.8 billion, or 
$750,000 per job. In addition, Gary Hufbauer and Ben Goodrich, economists at 
the Institute for International Economics, estimate that the tariffs could temporar-
ily save 3,500 jobs in the steel industry, but at an annual cost to steel users of $2 
billion, or $584,000 per job saved. Yet recently the United States imposed tariffs of 
up to 616 percent on steel pipes imported from China, South Korea, and Mexico. 
Similarly, it is estimated that we spent more than $100,000 for every job saved in 
the apparel manufacturing industry—jobs that seldom paid more than $35,000  
a year.
Reasons Against Trade Restrictions
Trade restrictions have immediate and long-term economic consequences—both within 
the restricting nation and in world trade patterns. These include the following:
●
●Higher prices for consumers. Higher prices may result from the imposition of 
tariffs or the elimination of foreign competition, as described earlier. For exam-
ple, imposing quota restrictions and import protections adds $25 billion annu-
ally to U.S. consumers’ apparel costs by directly increasing costs for imported 
apparel.
●
●Restriction of consumers’ choices. Again, this is a direct result of the elimination 
of some foreign products from the marketplace and of the artificially high prices 
that importers must charge for products that are still imported.
●
●Misallocation of international resources. The protection of weak industries results 
in the inefficient use of limited resources. The economies of both the restricting 
nation and other nations eventually suffer because of this waste.
●
●Loss of jobs. The restriction of imports by one nation must lead to cutbacks—and 
the loss of jobs—in the export-oriented industries of other nations. Furthermore, 
trade protection has a significant effect on the composition of employment. U.S. 
trade restrictions—whether on textiles, apparel, steel, or automobiles—benefit 
only a few industries while harming many others. The gains in employment accrue 
to the protected industries and their primary suppliers, and the losses are spread 
across all other industries. A few states gain employment, but many other states 
lose employment.

Part 1   The Environment of Business
The Extent of International Business
Restrictions or not, international business is growing. Although the worldwide recessions 
of 1991 and 2001–2002 slowed the rate of growth, and the 2008–2009 global economic 
crisis caused the sharpest decline in more than 75 years, globalization is a reality of our 
time. In the United States, international trade now accounts for over one-fourth of GDP. 
As trade barriers decrease, new competitors enter the global marketplace, creating more 
choices for consumers and new opportunities for job seekers. International business will 
grow along with the expansion of commercial use of the Internet.
The World Economic Outlook for Trade
Although the global economy continued to grow robustly until 2007 economic 
performance was not equal: growth in the advanced economies slowed and then 
stopped in 2009, whereas emerging and developing economies continued to grow. 
Looking ahead, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an international bank with 
187 member nations, expected a gradual global growth to continue in 2012 and 2013 
in both advanced and emerging developing economies.4
Although the U.S. economy had been growing steadily since 2000 and recorded 
the longest peacetime expansion in the nation’s history, the worldwide recession which 
began in December 2007 has slowed the rate of growth. The IMF estimated that the U.S. 
economy grew by less than half of 1 percent in 2008 and, because of subprime mortgage 
lending and other global financial problems, declined 2.5 percent in 2009. However, 
international experts expected global economic growth of 3.3 percent in 2012 and 3.9 
percent in 2013, despite the high oil prices and financial crises in the euro area economies.
Canada and Western Europe  Our leading export partner, Canada, is projected 
to show a growth rate of 1.7 percent in 2012 and 2.0 percent in 2013. The euro area, 
which was projected to decline by 0.5 percent in 2012 is expected to grow 0.8 percent 
in 2013. The United Kingdom is expected to grow 0.6 percent and 2.0 percent in 2012 
and 2013, respectively.
Mexico and Latin America  Our second-largest export customer, Mexico, suffered its 
sharpest recession ever in 1995, and experienced another major setback in 2009. However, 
its growth rate in 2012 and 2013 is expected to be 3.5 percent. Brazil escaped the recent 
global economic crisis with only minor setbacks: Its growth in 2010 was more than 7.5 per-
cent, and in 2011 it declined to 2.9 percent. Growth of about 3 percent and 
4 percent is expected in 2012 and 2013, respectively. In general, the Latin 
American and the Caribbean economies are recovering at a robust pace.
Japan  Japan’s economy is regaining some momentum after suffer-
ing from an earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear plant disaster in 2011. 
Stronger consumer demand and business investment make Japan less 
reliant on exports for growth. The IMF estimates the growth for Japan 
at 1.7 percent in 2012 and 1.8 percent in 2013.
Other Asian Countries  The economic growth in Asia remained strong 
in 2010 and 2011 despite the global recession. Growth was led by China, 
where its economy expanded by 9.2 percent in 2011, and is expected to 
grow at 8.2 percent and 8.8 percent in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Growth 
in India was 7.4 percent in 2011, and is predicted to grow at 7 percent and 
7.3 percent in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Growth in ASEAN-5 coun-
tries—Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam—is 
expected at 5.2 percent and 5.6 percent in 2012 and 2013, respectively. In 
short, the key emerging economies in Asia are leading the global recovery.
China’s emergence as a global economic power has been among the 
most dramatic economic developments of recent decades. From 1980 to

2004, China’s economy averaged a real GDP growth rate of 9.5 percent and became 
the world’s sixth-largest economy. By 2004, China had become the third-largest trading 
nation in dollar terms, behind the United States and Germany and just ahead of Japan. 
Today, China, the world’s second-largest economy, generates 10 to 15 percent of world 
GDP, and in 2011, accounted for about 25 percent of world GDP growth. The United 
States now imports more goods from China than any other nation in the world. In 
fact, China, with almost $1.9 trillion in exports, is the world’s number-one exporter. In 
2012, China took steps to promote the international use of its currency, the renminbi.5
Commonwealth of Independent States  The growth in this region is expected to 
be 3.7 percent in 2012 and 3.8 percent in 2013. Strong growth is expected to continue 
in Azerbaijan and Armenia, whereas growth is projected to remain stable in Moldova, 
Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.
After World War II, trade between the United States and the communist nations of 
Central and Eastern Europe was minimal. The United States maintained high tariff bar-
riers on imports from most of these countries and also restricted their exports. However, 
since the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the collapse of communism, trade 
between the United States and Central and Eastern Europe has expanded substantially.
The countries that made the transition from communist to market economies 
quickly have recorded positive growth for several years—those that did not continue 
to struggle. Among the nations that have enjoyed several years of positive economic 
growth are the member countries of the Central European Free Trade Association: 
Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia, and Slovakia.
U.S. exports to Central and Eastern Europe and Russia will increase, as will U.S. 
investment in these countries, as demand for capital goods and technology opens new 
markets for U.S. products. There already has been a substantial expansion in trade 
between the United States and the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland. 
Table 3.1 shows the growth rates from 2010 to 2013 for most regions of the world.
Exports and the U.S. Economy  In 2008, U.S. exports supported more than 10.3 
million full- and part-time jobs during a historic time, when exports as a percentage 
of GDP reached the highest levels since 1916. The new record, 13.8 percent of GDP in 
2011, shows that U.S. businesses have great opportunities in the global marketplace.

Part 1   The Environment of Business
Even though the global economic crisis caused the number of jobs supported by exports 
to decline sharply to 8.5 million in 2009, globalization represents a huge opportunity 
for all countries—rich or poor. Indeed, in 2011, for the first time, the U.S. exports 
exceeded $2.1 trillion and supported 9.7 million jobs, an increase of $1.2 million since 
2009.6 The 15-fold increase in trade volume over the past 60 years has been one of 
the most important factors in the rise of living standards around the world. During 
this time, exports have become increasingly important to the U.S. economy. Exports as 
a percentage of U.S. GDP have increased steadily since 1985, except in the 2001 and 
2008 recessions. Our exports to developing and newly industrialized countries are on 
the rise. Table 3.2 shows the value of U.S. merchandise exports to, and imports from, 
each of the nation’s ten major trading partners. Note that Canada and Mexico are our 
best partners for our exports; China and Canada, for imports.
Figure 3.3 shows the U.S. goods export and import shares in 2011. Major U.S. 
exports and imports are manufactured goods, agricultural products, and mineral fuels.

International Trade Agreements
The General Agreement on Tariffs and  
Trade and the World Trade Organization
At the end of World War II, the United States and 22 other nations organized the body 
that came to be known as GATT. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) was an international organization of 153 nations dedicated to reducing or 
eliminating tariffs and other barriers to world trade. These 153 nations accounted 
for more than 97 percent of the world’s merchandise trade (see Figure 3.4). GATT, 
headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, provided a forum for tariff negotiations and 
a means for settling international trade disputes and problems. Most-favored-nation 
status (MFN) was the famous principle of GATT. It meant that each GATT member 
nation was to be treated equally by all contracting nations. Therefore, MFN ensured 
that any tariff reductions or other trade concessions were extended automatically to all 
GATT members. From 1947 to 1994, the body sponsored eight rounds of negotiations 
to reduce trade restrictions. Three of the most fruitful were the Kennedy Round, the 
Tokyo Round, and the Uruguay Round.
The Kennedy Round (1964–1967)  In 1962, the United States Congress passed 
the Trade Expansion Act. This law gave President John F. Kennedy the authority to 
negotiate reciprocal trade agreements that could reduce U.S. tariffs by as much as 
50 percent. Armed with this authority, which was granted for a period of five years, 
President Kennedy called for a round of negotiations through GATT.
These negotiations, which began in 1964, have since become known as the 
Kennedy Round. They were aimed at reducing tariffs and other barriers to trade in

Part 1   The Environment of Business
both industrial and agricultural products. The participants succeeded in reducing tar-
iffs on these products by an average of more than 35 percent. However, they were less 
successful in removing other types of trade barriers.
The Tokyo Round (1973–1979)  In 1973, representatives of approximately 100 
nations gathered in Tokyo for another round of GATT negotiations. The Tokyo Round 
was completed in 1979. The participants negotiated tariff cuts of 30 to 35 percent, 
which were to be implemented over an eight-year period. In addition, they were able to 
remove or ease such nontariff barriers as import quotas, unrealistic quality standards 
for imports, and unnecessary red tape in customs procedures.
The Uruguay Round (1986–1993)  In 1986, the Uruguay Round was launched to 
extend trade liberalization and widen the GATT treaty to include textiles, agricultural 
products, business services, and intellectual-property rights. This most ambitious and 
comprehensive global commercial agreement in history concluded overall negotiations 
on December 15, 1993, with delegations on hand from 109 nations. The agreement 
included provisions to lower tariffs by greater than one-third, to reform trade in agri-
cultural goods, to write new rules of trade for intellectual property and services, and 
to strengthen the dispute-settlement process. These reforms were expected to expand 
the world economy by an estimated $200 billion annually.
The Uruguay Round also created the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 
January 1, 1995. The WTO was established by GATT to oversee the provisions of the 
Uruguay Round and resolve any resulting trade disputes. Membership in the WTO 
obliges 153 member nations to observe GATT rules. The WTO has judicial powers 
to mediate among members disputing the new rules. It incorporates trade in goods, 
services, and ideas and exerts more binding authority than GATT. Its main function is 
to ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably, and freely as possible.
The Doha Round (2001)  On November 14, 2001, in Doha, Qatar, the WTO mem-
bers agreed to further reduce trade barriers through multilateral trade negotiations 
over the next three years. This new round of negotiations focuses on industrial tariffs 
and nontariff barriers, agriculture, services, and easing trade rules. U.S. exporters of 
industrial and agricultural goods and services should have improved access to overseas 
markets. The Doha Round has set the stage for WTO members to take an important 
step toward significant new multilateral trade liberalization. It is a difficult task, but 
the rewards—lower tariffs, more choices for consumers, and further integration of 
developing countries into the world trading system—are sure to be worth the effort. 
Some experts suggest that U.S. exporters of industrial and agricultural goods and 
services should have improved access to overseas markets, whereas others disagree. 
Negotiations between the developed and developing countries continued in 2012.
World Trade and the Global Economic Crisis
After the sharpest decline in more than 72 years, world trade was set to rebound in 
2010 by growing at 9.5 percent, according to the WTO economists. In a 2012 speech, 
WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy stated, “The multilateral trading system has been 
instrumental in maintaining trade openness during the crisis, thereby avoiding even 
worse outcomes. Members must remain vigilant. This is not the time for go-it-alone 
measures. This is the time to strengthen and preserve the global trading system so that 
it keeps performing this vital function in the future.”7
Exports from developed economies increased nearly 13 percent in 2010, compared 
to a 16.5 percent increase in the rest of the world. China’s exports increased in 2010 
by a massive 28 percent. Furthermore, the higher prices and extraordinary growth of 
trade in developing Asia increased the combined share of developing economies and 
the Commonwealth of Independent States in world exports to 45 percent in 2010, its 
highest ever.

International Economic Organizations 
Working to Foster Trade
The primary objective of the WTO is to remove barriers to trade on a worldwide basis. 
On a smaller scale, an economic community is an organization of nations formed 
to promote the free movement of resources and products among its members and to 
create common economic policies. A number of economic communities now exist.
The European Union  The European Union (EU), also known as the European 
Economic Community and the Common Market, was formed in 1957 by six 
­countries—France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, 
and Luxembourg. Its objective was freely conducted commerce among these nations 
and others that might later join. As shown in Figure 3.5, many more nations have 
joined the EU since then.
On January 1, 2007, the 25 nations of the EU became the EU27 as Bulgaria and 
Romania became new members. The EU, with a population of nearly half a billion, is now 
an economic force with a collective economy larger than much of the United States or Japan.
In celebrating the EU’s 50th anniversary in 2007, the president of the European 
Commission, Jose Manuel Durao Barraso, declared, “Let us first recognize 50 years 
of achievement. Peace, liberty, and prosperity, beyond the dreams of even the most 
optimistic founding fathers of Europe. In 1957, 15 of our 27 members were either 
under dictatorship or were not allowed to exist as independent countries. Now we are 
all prospering democracies. The EU of today is around 50 times more prosperous and 
with three times the population of the EU of 1957.”

Part 1   The Environment of Business
Since January 2002, 15 member nations of the EU have been participating in 
the new common currency, the euro. The euro is the single currency of the European 
Monetary Union nations. However, three EU members, Denmark, the United Kingdom, 
and Sweden, still maintain their own currencies.
The North American Free Trade Agreement  The North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA) joined the United States with its first- and second-largest export 
trading partners, Canada and Mexico. Implementation of NAFTA on January 1, 1994, 
created a market of more than 462 million people. This market consists of Canada 
(population 34 million), the United States (313 million), and Mexico (115 million). 
According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, after 18 years, NAFTA has 
achieved its core goals of expanding trade and investment between the United States, 
Canada, and Mexico. For example, from 1993 to 2011, trade among the NAFTA 
nations more than tripled, from $297 billion to $1,058 billion. 
NAFTA is built on the Canadian Free Trade Agreement, signed by the United 
States and Canada in 1989, and on the substantial trade and investment reforms 
undertaken by Mexico since the mid-1980s. Initiated by the Mexican government, 
formal negotiations on NAFTA began in June 1991 among the three governments. 
The support of NAFTA by President Bill Clinton, past U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan 
and Jimmy Carter, and Nobel Prize–winning economists provided the impetus for U.S. 
congressional ratification of NAFTA in November 1993. By 2008, NAFTA had gradu-
ally eliminated all tariffs and quotas on goods produced and traded among Canada, 
Mexico, and the United States to provide for a totally free-trade area. Chile is expected 
to become the fourth member of NAFTA, but political forces may delay its entry into 
the agreement for several years.
However, NAFTA is not without its critics. Critics maintain that NAFTA:
●
●has not achieved its goals
●
●has resulted in job losses
●
●hurts workers by eroding labor standards and lowering wages
●
●undermines national sovereignty and independence
●
●does nothing to help the environment, and
●
●hurts the agricultural sector
The proponents of NAFTA call the agreement a remarkable economic success 
story for all three partners. They maintain that NAFTA:
●
●has contributed to significant increases in trade and investment
●
●has benefited companies in all three countries
●
●has resulted in increased sales, new partnerships, and new opportunities
●
●has created high-paying export-related jobs, and
●
●better prices and selection in consumer goods
The Central American Free Trade Agreement  The Central American Free 
Trade Agreement (CAFTA) was created in 2003 by the United States and four Central 
American countries—El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The CAFTA 
became CAFTA-DR when the Dominican Republic joined the group in 2007. On 
January 1, 2009, Costa Rica joined CAFTA-DR as the sixth member. CAFTA-DR cre-
ates the third-largest U.S. export market in Latin America, behind only Mexico and 
Brazil. 
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations  The Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations, with headquarters in Jakarta, Indonesia, was established in 1967 to 
promote political, economic, and social cooperation among its seven member countries: 
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, and Vietnam. With 
the three new members, Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar, this region of 600 million 
people is already our fifth-largest trading partner.

The Commonwealth of Independent States  The 
Commonwealth of Independent States was established 
in December 1991 by the newly independent states as an 
association of 11 republics of the former Soviet Union.
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)  On November 
12, 2011, the leaders of the nine countries—Australia, 
Brunei Darussalam, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, 
Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States—
formed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This partnership will 
boost economies of the member countries, lower barriers to 
trade and investment, increase exports, and create more jobs. 
Together, these eight economies would be America’s fifth-largest 
trading partner. According to President Obama, “We already 
do more than $200 billion in trade with them every year, and 
with nearly 500 million consumers between us, there’s so much 
more that we can do together.” The Asia-Pacific region is one of 
the fastest growing areas in the world and TPP will open more 
markets to American businesses and exports.8
The Common Market of the Southern Cone 
(MERCOSUR)  The Common Market of the Southern Cone 
(MERCOSUR) was established in 1991 under the Treaty of 
Asuncion to unite Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay as a 
free-trade alliance; Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Chile 
joined later as associates. The alliance represents more than 267 
million consumers—67 percent of South America’s population, 
making it the third-largest trading block behind NAFTA and the 
EU. Like NAFTA, MERCOSUR promotes “the free circulation 
of goods, services and production factors among the countries” 
and established a common external tariff and commercial policy.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries was founded in 1960 in response to reductions in the 
prices that oil companies were willing to pay for crude oil. The 
organization was conceived as a collective bargaining unit to 
provide oil-producing nations with some control over oil prices.
Methods of Entering  
International Business
A firm that has decided to enter international markets can do so in several ways. We will 
discuss several different methods. These different approaches require varying degrees 
of involvement in international business. Typically, a firm begins its international 
operations at the simplest level. Then, depending on its goals, it may progress to higher 
levels of involvement.
Licensing
Licensing is a contractual agreement in which one firm permits another to produce and 
market its product and use its brand name in return for a royalty or other compensation. 
For example, Yoplait yogurt is a French yogurt licensed for production in the United 
States. The Yoplait brand maintains an appealing French image, and in return, the U.S. 
producer pays the French firm a percentage of its income from sales of the product.

a firm can organize for and

markets.

Part 1   The Environment of Business
Licensing is especially advantageous for small manufacturers 
wanting to launch a well-known domestic brand internationally. 
For example, all Spalding sporting products are licensed worldwide. 
The licensor, the Questor Corporation, owns the Spalding name but 
produces no goods itself. Licensing thus provides a simple method 
for expanding into a foreign market with virtually no investment. 
On the other hand, if the licensee does not maintain the licensor’s 
product standards, the product’s image may be damaged. Another 
possible disadvantage is that a licensing arrangement may not pro-
vide the original producer with any foreign marketing experience.
Exporting
A firm also may manufacture its products in its home country and 
export them for sale in foreign markets. As with licensing, exporting 
can be a relatively low-risk method of entering foreign markets. 
Unlike licensing, however, it is not a simple method; it opens up 
several levels of involvement to the exporting firm.
At the most basic level, the exporting firm may sell its prod-
ucts outright to an export–import merchant, which is essentially a 
merchant wholesaler. The merchant assumes all the risks of product 
ownership, distribution, and sale. It may even purchase the goods in the producer’s 
home country and assume responsibility for exporting the goods. An important and 
practical issue for domestic firms dealing with foreign customers is securing payment. 
This is a two-sided issue that reflects the mutual concern rightly felt by both parties 
to the trade deal: The exporter would like to be paid before shipping the merchandise, 
whereas the importer obviously would prefer to know that it has received the ship-
ment before releasing any funds. Neither side wants to take the risk of fulfilling its part 
of the deal only to discover later that the other side has not. The result would lead 
to legal costs and complex, lengthy dealings that would waste everyone’s resources. 
This mutual level of mistrust, in fact, makes good business sense and has been around 
since the beginning of trade centuries ago. The solution then was the same as it still is 
today—for both parties to use a mutually trusted go-between who can ensure that the 
payment is held until the merchandise is in fact delivered according to the terms of the 
trade contract. The go-between representatives employed by the importer and exporter 
are still, as they were in the past, the local domestic banks involved in international 
business.
Exporting to International Markets  American companies may manufacture 
their products in the United States and export them for sale in foreign markets. 
Exporting can be a relatively low-risk method of entering foreign markets.
Here is a simplified version of how it works. After signing contracts detailing the 
merchandise sold and terms for its delivery, an importer will ask its local bank to issue 
a letter of credit for the amount of money needed to pay for the merchandise. The 
letter of credit is issued “in favor of the exporter,” meaning that the funds are tied 
specifically to the trade contract involved. The importer’s bank forwards the letter of 
credit to the exporter’s bank, which also normally deals in international transactions. 
The exporter’s bank then notifies the exporter that a letter of credit has been received 
in its name, and the exporter can go ahead with the shipment. The carrier transporting 
the merchandise provides the exporter with evidence of the shipment in a document 
called a bill of lading. The exporter signs over title to the merchandise (now in transit) 
to its bank by delivering signed copies of the bill of lading and the letter of credit.
In exchange, the exporter issues a draft from the bank, which orders the importer’s 
bank to pay for the merchandise. The draft, bill of lading, and letter of credit are sent 
from the exporter’s bank to the importer’s bank. Acceptance by the importer’s bank 
leads to return of the draft and its sale by the exporter to its bank, meaning that the 
exporter receives cash and the bank assumes the risk of collecting the funds from the

foreign bank. The importer is obliged to pay its bank on delivery of 
the merchandise, and the deal is complete.
In most cases, the letter of credit is part of a lending arrange-
ment between the importer and its bank. Of course, both banks 
earn fees for issuing letters of credit and drafts and for handling the 
import–export services for their clients. Furthermore, the process 
incorporates the fact that both importer and exporter will have 
different local currencies and might even negotiate their trade in 
a third currency. The banks look after all the necessary exchanges. 
For example, the vast majority of international business is negoti-
ated in U.S. dollars, even though the trade may be between coun-
tries other than the United States. Thus, although the importer may 
end up paying for the merchandise in its local currency and the 
exporter may receive payment in another local currency, the banks 
involved will exchange all necessary foreign funds in order to allow 
the deal to take place.
Alternatively, the exporting firm may ship its products to an 
export–import agent, which arranges the sale of the products to 
foreign intermediaries for a commission or fee. The agent is an inde-
pendent firm—like other agents—that sells and may perform other 
marketing functions for the exporter. The exporter, however, retains 
title to the products during shipment and until they are sold.
An exporting firm also may establish its own sales offices, or branches, in for-
eign countries. These installations are international extensions of the firm’s distribu-
tion system. They represent a deeper involvement in international business than the 
other exporting techniques we have discussed—and thus they carry a greater risk. The 
exporting firm maintains control over sales, and it gains both experience in and knowl-
edge of foreign markets. Eventually, the firm also may develop its own sales force to 
operate in conjunction with foreign sales offices.
Joint Ventures
A joint venture is a partnership formed to achieve a specific goal or to operate for a 
specific period of time. A joint venture with an established firm in a foreign country 
provides immediate market knowledge and access, reduced risk, and control over 
product attributes. However, joint-venture agreements established across national 
borders can become extremely complex. As a result, joint-venture agreements generally 
require a very high level of commitment from all the parties involved.
A joint venture may be used to produce and market an existing product in a 
foreign nation or to develop an entirely new product. Recently, for example, Archer 
Daniels Midland Company (ADM), one of the world’s leading food processors, entered 
into a joint venture with Gruma SA, Mexico’s largest corn flour and tortilla company. 
Besides a 22 percent stake in Gruma, ADM also received stakes in other joint ven-
tures operated by Gruma. One of them will combine both companies’ U.S. corn flour 
operations, which account for about 25 percent of the U.S. market. ADM also has a 
40 percent stake in a Mexican wheat flour mill. ADM’s joint venture increased its par-
ticipation in the growing Mexican economy, where ADM already produces corn syrup, 
fructose, starch, and wheat flour.
Totally Owned Facilities
At a still deeper level of involvement in international business, a firm may develop 
totally owned facilities, that is, its own production and marketing facilities in one or 
more foreign nations. This direct investment provides complete control over operations, 
but it carries a greater risk than the joint venture. The firm is really establishing a 
subsidiary in a foreign country. Most firms do so only after they have acquired some 
knowledge of the host country’s markets.
Exporting to international markets. American 
companies may manufacture their products in the 
United States and export them for sale in foreign 
markets. Exporting can be a relatively risk-free method 
of entering foreign markets.

Part 1   The Environment of Business
Direct investment may take either of two forms. In the first, the firm builds or 
purchases manufacturing and other facilities in the foreign country. It uses these facili-
ties to produce its own established products and to market them in that country and 
perhaps in neighboring countries. Firms such as General Motors, Union Carbide, and 
Colgate-Palmolive are multinational companies with worldwide manufacturing facili-
ties. Colgate-Palmolive factories are becoming Eurofactories, supplying neighboring 
countries as well as their own local markets.
A second form of direct investment in international business is the purchase of an 
existing firm in a foreign country under an arrangement that allows it to operate inde-
pendently of the parent company. When Sony Corporation (a Japanese firm) decided 
to enter the motion picture business in the United States, it chose to 
purchase Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc., rather than start a 
new motion picture studio from scratch.
Strategic Alliances
A strategic alliance, the newest form of international business 
structure, is a partnership formed to create competitive advantage 
on a worldwide basis. Strategic alliances are very similar to joint 
ventures. The number of strategic alliances is growing at an 
estimated rate of about 20 percent per year. In fact, in the automobile 
and computer industries, strategic alliances are becoming the 
predominant means of competing. International competition 
is so fierce and the costs of competing on a global basis are so 
high that few firms have all the resources needed to do it alone. 
Thus, individual firms that lack the internal resources essential for 
international success may seek to collaborate with other companies.
An example of such an alliance is the New United Motor 
Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI), formed by Toyota and General 
Motors to make automobiles of both firms. This enterprise united 
the quality engineering of Japanese cars with the marketing exper-
tise and market access of General Motors.

Services Team Up to Enter India
A growing number of U.S.-based service 
firms are expanding into India by forming 
joint ventures with local firms. Both partners 
bring specific strengths to the joint venture, not 
just their brands but also the Indian firm’s in-depth knowledge 
of customers and the U.S. firm’s service concepts. 
For example, Cigna, which markets health insurance, has 
teamed up with TTK Group to sell insurance policies in India. 
TTK Group operates 1,500 retail stores and sells a variety of 
goods and services, including insurance. The joint venture will 
enable Cigna to reach consumers without creating a separate 
network of insurance agents—and TTK Group gains another 
product line to diversify its offerings. 
CBS and its partner in India, Reliance Broadcast Networks, 
recently launched English-language channels to tap into the 
country’s burgeoning market for television entertainment. CBS 
provides the content (including hit programs such as CSI) and 
Reliance provides its expertise in distribution and advertising 
sales for this joint venture, known as Big CBS.
Dunkin’ Donuts has a joint venture with Jubilant Foodworks 
to open shops featuring an all-day menu of coffee, donuts, 
and other foods adapted to Indian tastes. In this partnership, 
“Dunkin’ provides flexibility in localizing recipes, and we have 
strengths in food and culinary which we intend to leverage,” 
explains Jubilant’s chairman.

Trading Companies
A trading company provides a link between buyers and sellers in different countries. 
A trading company, as its name implies, is not involved in manufacturing or owning 
assets related to manufacturing. It buys products in one country at the lowest price 
consistent with quality and sells to buyers in another country. An important function of 
trading companies is taking title to products and performing all the activities necessary 
to move the products from the domestic country to a foreign country. For example, 
large grain-trading companies operating out of home offices both in the United States 
and overseas control a major portion of the world’s trade in basic food commodities. 
These trading companies sell homogeneous agricultural commodities that can be stored 
and moved rapidly in response to market conditions.
Countertrade
In the early 1990s, many developing nations had major restrictions on converting 
domestic currency into foreign currency. Therefore, exporters had to resort to barter 
agreements with importers. Countertrade is essentially an international barter 
transaction in which goods and services are exchanged for different goods and services. 
Examples include Saudi Arabia’s purchase of ten 747 jets from Boeing with payment 
in crude oil and Philip Morris’s sale of cigarettes to Russia in return for chemicals used 
to make fertilizers.
Multinational Firms
A multinational enterprise is a firm that operates on a worldwide scale without ties 
to any specific nation or region. The multinational firm represents the highest level of 
involvement in international business. It is equally “at home” in most countries of the 
world. In fact, as far as the operations of the multinational enterprise are concerned, 
national boundaries exist only on maps. It is, however, organized under the laws of its 
home country.
Table 3.3 shows the ten largest foreign and U.S. public multinational companies; 
the ranking is based on a composite score reflecting each company’s best three out of 
four rankings for sales, profits, assets, and market value. Table 3.4 describes steps in 
entering international markets.

Part 1   The Environment of Business
According to the chairman of the board of Dow Chemical Company, a multi-
national firm of U.S. origin, “The emergence of a world economy and of the mul-
tinational corporation has been accomplished hand in hand.” He sees multinational 
enterprises moving toward what he calls the “anational company,” a firm that has no 
nationality but belongs to all countries. In recognition of this movement, there already 
have been international conferences devoted to the question of how such enterprises 
would be controlled.
Sources of Export Assistance
In August 2010, President Obama announced the National Export Initiative (NEI) 
to revitalize U.S. exports. Under the NEI, many federal agencies assist U.S. firms in 
developing export-promotion programs. The export services and programs of these

agencies can help American firms to compete in foreign markets and create new jobs 
in the United States. For example, in 2011 the International Trade Administration 
coordinated 77 trade missions to 38 countries. More than 1,120 companies secured 
over $1.25 billion in export sales during these missions. Table 3.5 provides an overview 
of selected export assistance programs.
These and other sources of export information enhance the business opportunities 
of U.S. firms seeking to enter expanding foreign markets. Another vital energy factor 
is financing.
Financing International Business
International trade compounds the concerns of financial managers. Currency exchange 
rates, tariffs and foreign exchange controls, and the tax structures of host nations all 
affect international operations and the flow of cash. In addition, financial managers 
must be concerned both with the financing of their international operations and with 
the means available to their customers to finance purchases.
Fortunately, along with business in general, a number of large banks have become 
international in scope. Many have established branches in major cities around the world. 
Thus, like firms in other industries, they are able to provide their services where and 
when they are needed. In addition, financial assistance is available from U.S. govern-
ment and international sources.
Several of today’s international financial organizations were founded many years 
ago to facilitate free trade and the exchange of currencies among nations. Some, such 
as the Inter-American Development Bank, are supported internationally and focus on 
developing countries. Others, such as the Export-Import Bank, are operated by one 
country but provide international financing.
The Export-Import Bank of the United States
The Export-Import Bank of the United States, created in 1934, is an independent 
agency of the U.S. government whose function is to assist in financing the exports of 
American firms. Ex-Im Bank, as it is commonly called, extends and guarantees credit 
to overseas buyers of American goods and services and guarantees short-term financing 
for exports. It also cooperates with commercial banks in helping American exporters 
to offer credit to their overseas customers.

Part 1   The Environment of Business
According to Fred P. Hochberg, chairman and pres-
ident of Ex-Im Bank, “Working with private lenders we 
are helping U.S. exporters put Americans to work pro-
ducing the high quality goods and services that foreign 
buyers prefer. As part of President Obama’s National 
Export Initiative, Ex-Im Bank’s export financing is con-
tributing to the goal of doubling of U.S. exports within 
the next five years.”
Multilateral Development Banks
A multilateral development bank (MDB) is an internationally 
supported bank that provides loans to developing countries 
to help them grow. The most familiar is the World Bank, a 
cooperative of 187 member countries, which operates worldwide. 
Established in 1944 and headquartered in Washington, DC, 
the bank provides low-interest loans, interest-free credits, and 
grants to developing countries. The loans and grants help these 
countries to:
●
●supply safe drinking water
●
●build schools and train teachers
●
●increase agricultural productivity
●
●expand citizens’ access to markets, jobs, and housing
●
●improve health care and access to water and sanitation
●
●manage forests and other natural resources
●
●build and maintain roads, railways, and ports, and
●
●reduce air pollution and protect the environment.9
Four other MDBs operate primarily in Central and South America, Asia, Africa, 
and Eastern and Central Europe. All five are supported by the industrialized nations, 
including the United States.
The Inter-American Development Bank  The Inter-American Development Bank 
(IDB), the oldest and largest regional bank, was created in 1959 by 19 Latin American 
countries and the United States. The bank, which is headquartered in Washington, DC, 
makes loans and provides technical advice and assistance to countries. Today, the IDB 
is owned by 48 member states.
The Asian Development Bank  With 67 member nations, the Asian Development 
Bank (ADB), created in 1966 and headquartered in the Philippines, promotes economic 
and social progress in Asian and Pacific regions. The U.S. government is the second-
largest contributor to the ADB’s capital, after Japan.
The African Development Bank  The African Development Bank (AFDB), also 
known as Banque Africaines de Development, was established in 1964 with head-
quarters in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Its members include 53 African and 24 non-African 
countries from the Americas, Europe, and Asia. The AFDB’s goal is to foster the 
economic and social development of its African members. The bank pursues this goal 
through loans, research, technical assistance, and the development of trade programs.
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  Established in 1991 
to encourage reconstruction and development in the Eastern and Central European 
countries, the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
is owned by 61 countries and 2 intergovernmental institutions. Its loans are geared 
toward developing market-oriented economies and promoting private enterprise.

If you’re interested in doing business outside the United 
States, you’ll need to know something about international 
finance. Currency exchange rates will affect anything you 
buy or sell, for example, and you’ll probably want to deal

The International Monetary Fund
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international bank with 188 member 
nations that makes short-term loans to developing countries experiencing balance-
of-payment deficits. This financing is contributed by member nations, and it must be 
repaid with interest. Loans are provided primarily to fund international trade. Created 
in 1945 and headquartered in Washington, DC, the bank’s main goals are to:
●
●promote international monetary cooperation,
●
●facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade,
●
●promote exchange rate stability,
●
●assist in establishing a multilateral system of payments, and
●
●make resources available to members experiencing balance-of-payment difficulties.
The Challenges Ahead

Part 1   The Environment of Business
Explain the economic basis for international 
business.
International business encompasses all business activities that 
involve exchanges across national boundaries. International 
trade is based on specialization, whereby each country 
produces the goods and services that it can produce more 
efficiently than any other goods and services. A nation is 
said to have a comparative advantage relative to these goods. 
International trade develops when each nation trades its 
surplus products for those in short supply.
A nation’s balance of trade is the difference between the 
value of its exports and the value of its imports. Its balance 
of payments is the difference between the flow of money into 
and out of the nation. Generally, a negative balance of trade 
is considered unfavorable.
Discuss the restrictions nations place on 
international trade, the objectives of these 
restrictions, and their results.
Despite the benefits of world trade, nations tend to use 
tariffs and nontariff barriers (import quotas, embargoes, and 
other restrictions) to limit trade. These restrictions typically 
are justified as being needed to protect a nation’s economy, 
industries, citizens, or security. They can result in the loss of

The world of today is virtually unrecognizable from the world in which we lived one 
generation ago.” The most striking example of globalization is Apple. Apple’s iPod is 
designed in the United States, manufactured with components from Japan, Korea, and 
several other Asian countries, and assembled in China by a company from Chinese 
Taipei. Nowadays, most products are not “Made in the UK” or “Made in France”; they 
are in fact “Made in the World.”10
In 2012, the global economic recovery remained sluggish. Financial challenges in 
some euro-area economies slowed the economic growth. However, WTO rules and 
principles have assisted governments in keeping markets open and they now provide 
a platform for which the trade can grow as the global economy improves. According 
to Mr. Lamy, “We see the light at the end of the tunnel and trade promises to be an 
important part of the recovery. But we must avoid derailing any economic revival 
through protectionism.”
Inside
Business
If Volkswagen achieves its goal of manufacturing and sell-
ing 10 million vehicles yearly by 2018, it will move into 
first place as the world’s largest automaker. With this in 
mind, Volkswagen is redesigning its vehicles so more parts 
fit more models, an important consideration for a com-
pany with facilities in so many countries. “We’re creating 
a system that enables us to produce vehicles based on 
this architecture at any factory,” explains a Volkswagen 
executive.
The company’s joint ventures in China are also a key 
advantage in its expansion plans. China has the potential 
to be Volkswagen’s largest market within just a few years 
because of higher demand from the ever-growing middle 
class. Volkswagen is already the top-selling foreign car 
brand in China, and building on that success will only add 
momentum to the company’s global growth.

jobs, higher prices, fewer choices in the marketplace, and the 
misallocation of resources.
Outline the extent of international business and 
the world economic outlook for trade.
World trade is generally increasing. Trade between the 
United States and other nations is increasing in dollar value 
but decreasing in terms of our share of the world market. 
Exports as a percentage of U.S. GDP have increased steadily 
since 1985, except in the 2001 and 2008 recessions.
Discuss international trade agreements and 
international economic organizations working to 
foster trade.
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
was formed to dismantle trade barriers and provide an 
environment in which international business can grow. Today, 
the World Trade Organization (WTO) and various economic 
communities carry on this mission. These world economic 
communities include the European Union, the NAFTA, the 
CAFTA, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the 
Pacific Rim, the Commonwealth of Independent States, 
the Caribbean Basin Initiative, the Common Market of the 
Southern Cone, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development.
Define the methods by which a firm can organize 
for and enter into international markets.
A firm can enter international markets in several ways. It may 
license a foreign firm to produce and market its products. 
It may export its products and sell them through foreign 
intermediaries or its own sales organization abroad, or it 
may sell its exports outright to an export–import merchant. 
It may enter into a joint venture with a foreign firm. It may 
establish its own foreign subsidiaries, or it may develop into 
a multinational enterprise.
Generally, each of these methods represents an increas-
ingly deeper level of involvement in international business, 
with licensing being the simplest and the development of a 
multinational corporation the most involved.
Describe the various sources of export 
assistance.
Many government and international agencies provide 
export assistance to U.S. and foreign firms. The export 
services and programs of the 19 agencies of the U.S. Trade 
Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) can help U.S. 
firms to compete in foreign markets and create new jobs 
in the United States. Sources of export assistance include 
U.S. Export Assistance Centers, the International Trade 
Administration, U.S. and Foreign Commercial Services, 
Export Legal Assistance Network, Advocacy Center, 
National Trade Data Bank, and other government and 
international agencies.
Identify the institutions that help firms and 
nations finance international business.
The financing of international trade is more complex than 
that of domestic trade. Institutions such as the Ex-Im Bank 
and the International Monetary Fund have been established 
to provide financing and ultimately to increase world trade 
for American and international firms.

Part 1   The Environment of Business
It’s been hot in Brazil. No, we’re not talking about the country’s 
temperature: We’re talking about its economy, which has been 
growing at a heated pace. In 2010, the country’s GDP grew by 
7.5 percent. That’s a growth rate developed countries such as 
the United States haven’t experienced for years, if not decades. 
Although Brazil’s growth rate slowed considerably in 2011 and 
2012 due to the global economic crisis, it has fared better than 
many other nations. Recently it surpassed the United Kingdom as 
the sixth-largest economy in the world.
Why has Brazil done so well economically? Increased world 
trade is one reason why. The country has an abundant amount 
of natural resources firms in other countries around the world are 
eager to buy—especially companies in the fast-growing nation of 
China. Greater exports have also helped 40 million Brazilians rise 
up out of poverty and into the middle class. Their massive spend-
ing power is creating new markets for multinational companies 
ranging from McDonald’s and Whirlpool to Nestlé, Avon, and 
Volkswagen. Brazil has become Avon’s largest market. Volkswagen 
now sells more cars in Brazil than it does Germany, where the 
company is headquartered. “China may have over a billion inhab-
itants, but Brazil has 200,000 consumers,” explains Ivan Zurita, 
the president of Nestle’s Brazil division.
Clouds on the horizon threaten to cool off Brazil’s growth, 
however. To begin with, the country is concerned that its trade 
with China is out of balance. Although China purchases more 
natural resources from Brazil than any other nation, it doesn’t 
purchase near as many manufactured goods from Brazil as it 
exports to it.
A bigger issue is the appreciation of Brazil’s currency, the real. 
Massive amounts of money have been flowing into Brazil to take 
advantage of the nation’s high interest rates and growth oppor-
tunities. This has increased the demand for the real, causing its 
value to rise by nearly 50 percent relative to other currencies. The 
good news is that the stronger real has made imported products 
cheaper for Brazilians to buy. The bad news is that products 
made in Brazil have become more expensive for the rest of the 
world to purchase, slowing the country’s exports and growth.
Businesses in Brazil have lobbied the government to weaken 
the real so their products are better able to compete against 
imports. Their efforts appear to have paid off. Recently, Guido 
Mantega, Brazil’s minister of finance, said the country will take 
steps “as needed” to weaken the real. The government has also 
imposed tariffs on a number of imported products, including 
cars, shoes, chemicals, and textiles, and signed a trade deal with 
Mexico that put a quota on the number of automobiles imported 
from that country.
Imports and the value of the real are not the only clouds 
threatening Brazil, though. Businesses in the country face a great 
deal of bureaucratic red tape, heavy regulations, and tax rates 
that are some of the highest in the world. To deal with these 
problems, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has announced 
that her administration will eliminate payroll taxes for employers

in industries hardest hit by imports. To further ease the nation’s 
growing pains, Brazil’s development bank, BDM, will subsidize 
business loans to boost the production of many products, includ-
ing tablets and off-shore oil rigs. The goal is to stimulate tech-
nological innovations that will enable manufacturers to produce 
higher-value products so Brazil doesn’t have to rely on natural 
resources to fuel its growth. “Look, a government isn’t made on 
the second or third day,” Rousseff has said about her administra-
tion’s incremental efforts to keep Brazil’s emerging economy mov-
ing forward. “It’s made over time. Things mature.”11
Questions
1.	 Do you think the efforts of Brazil’s government to keep the 
economy growing will be successful? Why or why not?
2.	 What downsides might Brazil experience by implementing 
quotas, tariffs, and measures to devalue its currency?
Few U.S. businesses are as international as McDonald’s, the 
Illinois-based fast-food giant that began as an all-American ham-
burger place. With $22 billion in annual revenue, McDonald’s 
now rings the world with 32,400 restaurants and serves 60 mil-
lion customers every day. Although the United States accounts for 
35 percent of McDonald’s global revenue, Europe accounts for 
41 percent and the Asia/Pacific, Middle East, and Africa regions 
account for 19 percent.
Hamburgers are, of course, the main attraction in many 
McDonald’s restaurants: Worldwide, the company sells 
more than four million burgers every day. However, one of 
McDonald’s key strengths is its ability to adapt to local tastes. 
In Japan, McDonald’s sells Cheese Katsu sandwiches, featuring 
fried pork and cheese. In the Middle East, it sells McArabia pita 
sandwiches filled with grilled chicken or spiced beef. In France, 
it sells Croque McDo sandwiches with melted cheese and ham. 
In India, it sells vegetarian McAloo Tikki burgers. In Mexico, 
it sells McMolletes sandwiches made with refried beans and 
cheese.
Being a global business also helps McDonald’s weather the 
economic ups and downs of different regions. At one point dur-
ing the recent recession, its Asian revenue grew almost twice as 
quickly as its European revenue, both of which balanced the 
smaller increase in U.S. sales. Worldwide, McDonald’s owns some 
of its restaurants and also sells franchise licenses to firms that 
open restaurants under the McDonald’s brand name. In some 
markets, the company operates restaurants in joint ventures with 
local firms. For example, in India, it has one joint venture with a 
local firm to operate restaurants in the west and south and a sec-
ond joint venture with a different company to operate restaurants 
in the east and the north.
The company is also building its global business by attracting 
more customers during different “dayparts,” such as at break-
fast time and in the late-night hours. A growing number of its 
global units stay open 24 hours a day for customer convenience. 
McDonald’s has introduced a steady stream of breakfast, bever-
age, snack, and sandwich items to encourage repeat visits from 
customers at all income levels.
On the high end, McDonald’s is doing well with its McCafés, 
which serve mochas and other gourmet coffees in a separate 
area of selected McDonald’s units. As the company opens new 
restaurants and remodels existing restaurants, it is adding more 
McCafés in U.S. and European markets. The Angus Burger is 
another popular premium menu item. Both McCafé coffees 
and Angus Burgers appeal to customers willing to pay a little 
more to splurge on high quality. At the same time, the items on 
McDonald’s budget menus are priced to appeal to customers 
who keep a close rein on their wallets.
Being a major power in global business means McDonald’s 
must think carefully about the value of the different currencies its 
restaurants take in. Outside the United States, much of its rev-
enue is rung up in euros, British pounds, Australian dollars, and 
Canadian dollars. As a result, McDonald’s pays close attention 
to swings in foreign-exchange rates as it manages its financial 
affairs.
McDonald’s is stepping up its involvement in sustainability 
all around the world. It has increased its use of packaging made 
from renewable materials and boosted recycling efforts to keep 
waste out of landfills. It has also been building eco-friendly 
restaurants in North and South America as well as in Europe to 
test green construction methods and cut back on energy and 
water usage. The company’s social responsibility menu includes 
­supporting the Ronald McDonald House charities and offer-
ing a range of organic foods and beverages plus healthy snack 
choices.
From India to Ireland, Argentina to Australia, McDonald’s is 
poised for continued growth in sales and profits as it expands its 
restaurant empire and cooks up new products for customers to 
enjoy around the clock and around the world.12
Questions
1.	 What are the advantages and disadvantages of McDonald’s 
ringing up sales in so many foreign currencies worldwide?
2.	 Why would McDonald’s use two joint ventures to operate res-
taurants in different regions of India?
3.	 Discuss how being a multinational enterprise, with a pres-
ence in more than 170 countries, helps McDonald’s build 
its business regardless of the short-term global economic 
outlook.

Part 1   The Environment of Business
1 	SOCIAL MEDIA EXERCISE
Although Nike was founded in the Pacific Northwest and still has 
its corporate headquarters near Beaverton, Oregon, the company 
has become a multinational enterprise. The firm employs more 
than 35,000 people across six continents and is now a global 
marketer of footwear, apparel, and athletic equipment. 
Because it operates in 160 countries around the globe and 
manufactures products in over 900 factories in 47 different coun-
tries, sustainability is a big initiative for Nike. Today, Nike uses the 
YouTube social media site to share its sustainability message with 
consumers, employees, investors, politicians, and other interested 
stakeholders.  To learn about the company’s efforts to sustain the 
planet, follow these steps:
●
●
Make an Internet connection and go to the YouTube Web site 
(www.youtube.com).
●
●
Enter the words “Nike” and “Sustainability” in the search win-
dow and click the search button.
1.	 View at least 3 different YouTube videos about Nike’s 
­sustainability efforts.
2.	 Based on the information in the videos you watched, do you 
believe that Nike is a good corporate citizen because of its 
efforts to sustain the planet?   Why or why not? 
3.	 Prepare a one to two page report that describes how Nike is 
taking steps to reduce waste, improve the environment, and 
reduce its carbon footprint while manufacturing products 
around the globe.  
2 	JOURNALING FOR SUCCESS
Discovery statement: This chapter was designed to excite you 
about international business and how trade among nations affects 
our daily lives.
Assignment
1.	 Assume that your friend, who recently lost his job in the automobile 
industry, is critical of imported Toyotas, Hondas, and Volkswagens. 
How would you respond to his resentment of imported goods?
2.	 What specific reasons will you offer to your friend in support of 
the fact that international trade is beneficial to society as a whole?
3.	 Ask your friend what might be some consequences if the trade 
among nations was banned.
3 	DEVELOPING CRITICAL-THINKING SKILLS
Suppose that you own and operate an electronics firm that man-
ufactures transistors and integrated circuits. As foreign competi-
tors enter the market and undercut your prices, you realize that 
your high labor costs are hindering your ability to compete. You 
are concerned about what to do and are open for suggestions. 
Recently, you have been trying to decide whether to move your 
plant to Mexico, where labor is cheaper.
Assignment
1.	 Questions you should consider in making this decision include 
the following:
a.	 Would you be better off to build a new plant in Mexico or 
to buy an existing building?
b.	 If you could find a Mexican electronics firm similar to 
yours, would it be wiser to try to buy it than to start your 
own operation?
c.	 What are the risks involved in directly investing in your 
own facility in a foreign country?
d.	 If you did decide to move your plant to Mexico, how 
would you go about it? Are there any government agencies 
that might offer you advice?
2.	 Prepare a two-page summary of your answers to these ­questions.
4 	BUILDING TEAM SKILLS
The North American Free Trade Agreement among the United 
States, Mexico, and Canada went into effect on January 1, 1994. 
It has made a difference in trade among the countries and has 
affected the lives of many people.
Assignment
1.	 Working in teams and using the resources of your library, 
investigate NAFTA. Answer the following questions:
a.	 What are NAFTA’s objectives?
b.	 What are its benefits?
c.	 What impact has NAFTA had on trade, jobs, and travel?
d.	 Some Americans were opposed to the implementation of 
NAFTA. What were their objections? Have any of these 
objections been justified?
e.	 Has NAFTA influenced your life? How?
2.	 Summarize your answers in a written report. Your team also 
should be prepared to give a class presentation.
5 	RESEARCHING DIFFERENT CAREERS
Today, firms around the world need employees with special skills. In 
some countries, such employees are not always available, and firms 
then must search abroad for qualified applicants. One way they 
can do this is through global workforce databases. As business and 
trade operations continue to grow globally, you may one day find 
yourself working in a foreign country, perhaps for an American com-
pany doing business there or for a foreign company. In what foreign 
country would you like to work? What problems might you face?
Assignment
1.	 Choose a country in which you might like to work.
2.	 Research the country. The National Trade Data Bank is a 
good place to start. Find answers to the following questions:
a.	 What language is spoken in this country? Are you pro-
ficient in it? What would you need to do if you are not 
­proficient?
b.	 What are the economic, social, and legal systems like in 
this nation?
c.	 What is its history?
d.	 What are its culture and social traditions like? How might 
they affect your work or your living arrangements?
3.	 Describe what you have found out about this country in a writ-
ten report. Include an assessment of whether you would want 
to work there and the problems you might face if you did.

Only a tiny fraction of family-owned businesses are still growing 
four generations after their founding, but happily for lovers of 
premium-quality ice cream, Graeter’s is one of them.
Now a $30 million firm with national distribution, Graeter’s was 
founded in Cincinnati in 1870 by Louis Charles Graeter and his 
wife, Regina Graeter. The young couple made ice cream and choco-
late candies in the back room of their shop, sold them in the front 
room, and lived upstairs. Ice cream was a special treat in this era 
before refrigeration, and the Graeters started from scratch every 
day to make theirs from the freshest, finest ingredients. Even after 
freezers were invented, the Graeters continued to make ice cream in 
small batches to preserve the quality, texture, and rich flavor.
After her husband’s death, Regina’s entrepreneurial leadership 
became the driving force behind Graeter’s expansion from 1920 
until well into the 1950s. At a time when few women owned or 
operated a business, Regina opened 20 new Graeter’s stores in 
the Cincinnati area and added manufacturing capacity to support 
this ambitious—and successful—growth strategy. Her sons and 
grandchildren followed her into the business and continued to 
open ice-cream shops all around Ohio and beyond. Today, three 
of Regina’s great-grandsons run Graeter’s with the same attention 
to quality that made the firm famous. In her honor, the street in 
front of the company’s ultramodern Cincinnati factory is named 
Regina Graeter Way.
THE SCOOP ON GRAETER’S SUCCESS
Graeter’s fourth-generation owners are Richard Graeter II (CEO), 
Robert (Bob) Graeter (vice president of operations), and Chip 
Graeter (vice president of retail operations). They grew up in the 
business, learning through hands-on experience how to do every-
thing from packing a pint of ice cream to locking up the store 
at night. They also absorbed the family’s dedication to product 
quality, a key reason for the company’s enduring success. “Our 
family has always been contented to make a little less profit in 
order to ensure our long-term survival,” explains the CEO. 
Throughout its history, Graeter’s has used a unique, time-
consuming manufacturing process to produce its signature ice 
creams in small batches. “Our competition is making thousands 
and thousands of gallons a day,” says Chip Graeter. “We are mak-
ing hundreds of gallons a day at the most. All of our ice cream 
is packed by hand, so it’s a very laborious process.” Graeter’s 
“French pot” manufacturing method ensures that very little air 
gets into the product. As a result, the company’s ice cream is 
dense and creamy, not light and fluffy—so dense, in fact, that 
each pint weighs nearly a pound.
Another success factor is the use of simple, fresh ingredients 
like high-grade chocolate, choice seasonal fruits, and farm-fresh 
cream. Graeter’s imports some ingredients, such as vanilla from 
Madagascar, and buys other ingredients from U.S. producers 
known for their quality. “We use a really great grade of choco-
late,” says Bob Graeter. “We don’t cut corners on that . . . 
Specially selected great black raspberries, strawberries, blueber-
ries, and cherries go into our ice cream because we feel that we 
want to provide flavor not from artificial or unnatural ingredients 
but from really quality, ripe, rich fruits.” Instead of tiny chocolate 
chips, Graeter’s products contain giant chunks formed when liq-
uid chocolate is poured into the ice-cream base just before the 
mixture is frozen and packed into pints.
MAINTAINING THE CORE OF SUCCESS
Graeter’s “fanatical devotion to product quality” and its time-
tested recipes have not changed over the years. The current gener-
ation of owners is maintaining this core of the company’s success 
while mixing in a generous dash of innovation.  “If you just pre-
serve the core,” Bob Graeter says, “ultimately you stagnate. And 
if you are constantly stimulating progress and looking for new 
ideas, well, then you risk losing what was important. . . . Part of 
your secret to long-term success is knowing what your core is and 
holding to that. Once you know what you’re really all about and 
what is most important to you, you can change everything else.” 
One of those “important” things is giving back to the com-
munity and its families via local charities and other initiatives. 
“Community involvement is just part of being a good corporate 
citizen,” observes Richard Graeter. When Graeter’s celebrated a 
recent new store opening, for example, it made a cash donation 
to the neighborhood public library. It is also a major sponsor of 
The Cure Starts Now Foundation, a research foundation seeking 
a cure for pediatric brain cancer. In line with its focus on natural 
goodness, Graeter’s has been doing its part to preserve the envi-
ronment by recycling and by boosting production efficiency to 
conserve water, energy, and other resources.
GRAETER’S LOOKS TO THE FUTURE
Even though Graeter’s recipes reflect its 19th-century heritage, 
the company is clearly a 21st-century operation. It has 150,000 
Facebook “likes,” connects with brand fans on Twitter, and invites 
customers to subscribe to its e-mail newsletter. The company sells 
its products online and ships orders via United Parcel Service to ice-
cream lovers across the continental United States. Its newly-opened 
production facility uses state-of-the-art refrigeration, storage, and 
sanitation—yet the ice cream is still mixed by hand rather than by 
automated equipment. With an eye toward future growth, Graeter’s 
is refining its information system to provide managers with all the 
details they need to make timely decisions in today’s fast-paced busi-
ness environment. 
Graeter’s competition ranges from small, local businesses to 
international giants such as Unilever, which owns Ben & Jerry’s, 
and Nestle, which owns Haagen-Dazs. Throughout the economic 
ups and downs of recent years, Graeter’s has continued to expand, 
and its ice creams are now distributed through 6,200 stores in 43 
states. Oprah Winfrey and other celebrities have praised its prod-
ucts in public. But the owners are just as proud of their home-town 
success. “Graeter’s in Cincinnati is synonymous with ice cream,” 
says Bob Graeter. “People will say, ‘Let’s go get a Graeter’s.’”13

Part 1   The Environment of Business
A business plan is a carefully constructed guide for a person start-
ing a business. The purpose of a well-prepared business plan is to 
show how practical and attainable the entrepreneur’s goals are. 
It also serves as a concise document that potential investors can 
examine to see if they would like to invest or assist in financing a 
new venture. A business plan should include the following  
12 components:
●
●
Introduction
●
●
Executive summary
●
●
Benefits to the community
●
●
Company and industry
●
●
Management team
●
●
Manufacturing and operations plan
●
●
Labor force
●
●
Marketing plan
●
●
Financial plan
●
●
Exit strategy
●
●
Critical risks and assumptions
●

Appendix
A brief description of each of these sections is provided in 
Chapter 5 (see also Table 5.3 on page 145).
This is the first of seven exercises that appear at the ends of 
each of the seven major parts in this textbook. The goal of these 
exercises is to help you work through the preceding components 
to create your own business plan. For example, in the exercise for 
this part, you will make decisions and complete the research that 
will help you to develop the introduction for your business plan 
and the benefits to the community that your business will provide. 
In the exercises for Parts 2 through 7, you will add more compo-
nents to your plan and eventually build a plan that actually could 
be used to start a business. The flowchart shown in Figure 3.6 
gives an overview of the steps you will be taking to prepare your 
business plan.
THE FIRST STEP: CHOOSING YOUR BUSINESS
One of the first steps for starting your own business is to decide 
what type of business you want to start. Take some time to think 
about this decision. Before proceeding, answer the following 
questions:
●
●
Why did you choose this type of business?
●
●
Why do you think this business will be successful?
●
●
Would you enjoy owning and operating this type of business?
Warning: Do not rush this step. This step often requires much 
thought, but it is well worth the time and effort. As an added 
bonus, you are more likely to develop a quality business plan if 
you really want to open this type of business.
Now that you have decided on a specific type of business, it 
is time to begin the planning process. The goal for this part is to 
complete the introduction and benefits-to-the-community com-
ponents of your business plan.
Before you begin, it is important to note that the business plan 
is not a document that is written and then set aside. It is a living 
document that an entrepreneur should refer to continuously in 
order to ensure that plans are being carried through appropri-
ately. As the entrepreneur begins to execute the plan, he or she 
should monitor the business environment continuously and make 
changes to the plan to address any challenges or opportunities 
that were not foreseen originally.
Throughout this course, you will, of course, be building your 
knowledge about business. Therefore, it will be appropriate for 
you to continually revisit parts of the plan that you have already 
written in order to refine them based on your more comprehen-
sive knowledge. You will find that writing your plan is not a simple 
matter of starting at the beginning and moving chronologically 
through to the end. Instead, you probably will find yourself jump-
ing around the various components, making refinements as you 
go. In fact, the second component—the executive summary—
should be written last, but because of its comprehensive nature 
and its importance to potential investors, it appears after the 
introduction in the final business plan. By the end of this course, 
you should be able to put the finishing touches on your plan, 
making sure that all the parts create a comprehensive and sound 
whole so that you can present it for evaluation.
THE INTRODUCTION COMPONENT
1.1.	 Start with the cover page. Provide the business name, street 
address, telephone number, Web address (if any), name(s) 
of owner(s) of the business, and the date the plan is issued.
1.2.	 Next, provide background information on the company and 
include the general nature of the business: retailing, manu-
facturing, or service; what your product or service is; what 
is unique about it; and why you believe that your business 
will be successful.
1.3.	 Then include a summary statement of the business’s finan-
cial needs, if any. You probably will need to revise your

FYI
Kimpton Hotel & Restaurant Group Strives for Perfection!
When investment banker Bill Kimpton traveled to Europe, he liked staying in small hotels 
with personality and personalized service rather than big hotels owned by big chains. 
Adapting the “boutique” hotel idea, he bought and renovated an older San Francisco hotel 
with architectural charm and a central location. It reopened in 1981 as the Clarion Bedford 
Hotel and featured each room decorated in an individual style rather than all being identi-
cal, as in most hotel chains. It also offered a complimentary wine-tasting hour to bring 
guests together in the lobby for a bit of socializing every evening.
Little by little, Kimpton and his investment partners bought and renovated other hotels 
on the West Coast and, later, across the country. Now, more than 30 years later, the 
company that Kimpton founded has grown to more than 100 boutique hotels and trendy 
restaurants in North America. It employs more than 7,200 employees and rings up annual 
revenue of more than $700 million.
Kimpton Hotel & Restaurant Group is a limited-liability company (LLC), a form of 
business ownership that allows it the financial and management flexibility to work with 
different investment partners on different hotel and restaurant properties. The company 
also partners with different chefs to create specialty restaurants where the chef, not the 
hotel manager, is in charge. This unconventional approach led to Kimpton partnering with 
Wolfgang Puck, among other well-known chefs, to open restaurants inside or alongside 
Kimpton hotels.
Kimpton’s boutique hotels are always adding special touches to make guests feel 
pampered. For example, under the “Guppy Love” program, the hotels will put a fish 
bowl stocked with goldfish in a guest room by request. The idea is to “provide little fish 
friends to anyone who [wants] a pet companion,” explains Niki Leondakis, Kimpton’s 
president. Employees further personalize the hotel experience by helping guests “live like 
a local, offering tailored recommendations from staff picks to one-of-a-kind experiences,” 
Leondakis adds. Whether they’re talking about a unique historical site or giving directions 
to a local art gallery, Kimpton’s employees are “proud to be the cultural ambassadors of 
their city.”1

B
ill Kimpton started the Kimpton Hotel and Restaurant Group—the company 
profiled in the Inside Business feature for this chapter—with one goal in mind: 
He wanted customers to have a unique and memorable experience. Over the 
next 30 years, with the help of investors and partners, Kimpton created more than 
100 boutique hotels and restaurants that ring up annual revenue of more than $700 
million and employ more than 7,200 employees. Pretty impressive achievements for a 
company that must compete with larger corporate hotel and restaurant chains.
For Bill Kimpton, deciding to start a business was only the first step. It takes hard 
work, and there are many decisions that you must make to build a successful business. 
For example, you must choose the right type of business ownership. Kimpton chose the 
limited liability company (LLC) form of ownership because it allows the financial and 
management flexibility to work with different investment partners on different hotels 
and restaurant properties. And yet, as you will see in this chapter, there are other popu-
lar forms of ownership including sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations. 
We begin this chapter by describing the three common forms of business owner-
ship: sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations. We discuss how these types

of businesses are formed and note the advantages and disadvantages of each. Next, 
we consider several types of business ownership usually chosen for special purposes, 
including S-corporations, limited-liability companies, not-for-profit corporations, 
cooperatives, joint ventures, and syndicates. We conclude the chapter with a discussion 
of how businesses can grow through internal expansion or through mergers with other 
companies.
Sole Proprietorships
A sole proprietorship is a business that is owned (and usually operated) by one 
person. Although a few sole proprietorships are large and have many employees, most 
are small. Sole proprietorship is the simplest form of business ownership and the easiest 
to start. In most instances, the owner (the sole proprietor) simply decides that he or she 
is in business and begins operations. Some of today’s largest corporations, including 
Walmart, JCPenney, H.J. Heinz Company, and Procter & Gamble Company, started 
out as tiny—and in many cases, struggling—sole proprietorships.
Often entrepreneurs with a promising idea choose the sole proprietorship form 
of ownership. Annie Withey, for example, created a cheddar cheese­–flavored popcorn 
snack food. Annie’s popcorn, called Smartfood, became one of the fastest-selling snack 
foods in U.S. history. After a few years, PepsiCo Inc.’s Frito-Lay division bought the 
brand for about $15 million. Ms. Withey, an organic farmer and mother of two chil-
dren, went on to develop an all-natural white-cheddar macaroni and cheese product. 
This venture was also a success. Today even though her firm, Annie’s Homegrown, has 
grown and become part of a larger conglomerate, Annie remains the entrepreneurial 
heart of the company and still thinks like a sole proprietor.
As you can see in Figure 4.1, there are approximately 23 million nonfarm sole 
proprietorships in the United States. They account for 72 percent of the country’s 
business firms. Although the most popular form of ownership when compared with 
partnerships and corporations, they rank last in total sales revenues. As shown in 
Figure 4.2, sole proprietorships account for about $1.3 trillion, or about 4 percent of 
total annual sales.
Sole proprietorships are most common in retailing, service, and agriculture. Thus, 
the clothing boutique, corner grocery, television-repair shop down the street, and small, 
independent farmers are likely to be sole proprietorships.

Advantages of Sole Proprietorships
Most of the advantages of sole proprietorships arise from the two main characteristics 
of this form of ownership: simplicity and individual control.
Ease of Start-Up and Closure  Sole proprietorship is the simplest and cheapest 
way to start a business. Often, start-up requires no contracts, agreements, or other legal 
documents. Thus, a sole proprietorship can be, and most often is, established without 
the services of an attorney. The legal requirements often are limited to registering the 
name of the business and obtaining any necessary licenses or permits.
If the enterprise does not succeed, the firm can be closed as 
easily as it was opened. Creditors must be paid, of course, but gen-
erally, the owner does not have to go through any legal procedure 
before hanging up an “Out of Business” sign.
Pride of Ownership  A successful sole proprietor is often very 
proud of her or his accomplishments—and rightfully so. In almost 
every case, the owner deserves a great deal of credit for solving the 
day-to-day problems associated with operating a sole proprietor-
ship. Unfortunately, the reverse is also true. When the business fails, 
it is often the sole proprietor who is to blame.
Retention of All Profits  Because all profits become the personal 
earnings of the owner, the owner has a strong incentive to succeed. 
This direct financial reward attracts many entrepreneurs to the sole 
proprietorship form of business and, if the business succeeds, is a 
source of great satisfaction.
No Special Taxes  Profits earned by a sole proprietorship are 
taxed as the personal income of the owner. As a result, sole propri-
etors must report certain financial information for the business on 
their personal income tax returns and make estimated quarterly tax

Part 2   Business Ownership and Entrepreneurship
unlimited liability  a legal concept 
that holds a business owner 
personally responsible for all the 
debts of the business
payments to the federal government. Thus, a sole pro-
prietorship does not pay the special state and federal 
income taxes that corporations pay.
Flexibility of Being Your Own Boss  A sole pro-
prietor is completely free to make decisions about 
the firm’s operations. Without asking or waiting for 
anyone’s approval, a sole proprietor can switch from 
retailing to wholesaling, move a shop’s location, open 
a new store, or close an old one. Suppose that the sole pro-
prietor of an appliance store finds that many customers now 
prefer to shop on Sunday afternoons. He or she can make an 
immediate change in business hours to take advantage of this 
information (provided that state laws allow such stores to 
open on Sunday). The manager of a store in a large corpo-
rate chain such as Best Buy Company may have to seek the 
approval of numerous managers and company officials before 
making such a change.
Disadvantages of Sole Proprietorships
The disadvantages of a sole proprietorship stem from the 
fact that these businesses are owned by one person. Some 
capable sole proprietors experience no problems. Individuals who start out with few 
management skills and little money are most at risk for failure.
Unlimited Liability  Unlimited liability is a legal concept that holds a business 
owner personally responsible for all the debts of the business. There is legally no dif-
ference between the debts of the business and the debts of the proprietor. If the busi-
ness fails, or if the business is involved in a lawsuit and loses, the owner’s personal 
property—including savings and other assets—can be seized (and sold if necessary) 
to pay creditors.
Unlimited liability is perhaps the major factor that tends to discourage would-be 
entrepreneurs with substantial personal wealth from using the sole proprietor form of 
business organization.
Lack of Continuity  Legally, the sole proprietor is the business. If the owner 
retires, dies, or is declared legally incompetent, the business essentially ceases to 
exist. In many cases, however—especially when the business is a profitable enter-
prise—the owner’s heirs take it over and either sell it or continue to operate it. The 
business also can suffer if the sole proprietor becomes ill and cannot work for an 
extended period of time. If the owner, for example, has a heart attack, there is often 
no one who can step in and manage the business. An illness can be devastating if 
the sole proprietor’s personal skills are what determine if the business is a success 
or a failure.
Lack of Money  Banks, suppliers, and other lenders usually are unwilling to lend large 
sums of money to sole proprietorships. Only one person—the sole proprietor—can be 
held responsible for repaying such loans, and the assets of most sole proprietors usually 
are limited. Moreover, these assets may have been used already as security or collateral 
for personal borrowing (a home mortgage or car loan) or for short-term credit from 
suppliers. Lenders also worry about the lack of continuity of sole proprietorships: Who

Do you dream of being your own boss? If you become a

you’ll have the final say, you’ll also be responsible if 
something goes wrong.

will repay a loan if the sole proprietor dies? Finally, many lenders are concerned about 
the large number of sole proprietorships that fail—a topic discussed in Chapter 5.
The limited ability to borrow money can prevent a sole proprietorship from grow-
ing. It is the main reason that many business owners, when in need of relatively large 
amounts of capital, change from a sole proprietorship to a partnership or corporate 
form of ownership.
Limited Management Skills  The sole proprietor is often the sole manager—in 
addition to being the only salesperson, buyer, accountant, and, on occasion, janitor. 
Even the most experienced business owner is unlikely to have expertise in all these 
areas. Unless he or she obtains the necessary expertise by hiring employees, assistants, 
or consultants, the business can suffer in the areas in which the owner is less knowl-
edgeable. For the many sole proprietors who cannot hire the help they need, there just 
are not enough hours in the day to do everything that needs to be done.
Difficulty in Hiring Employees  The sole proprietor may find it hard to attract and 
keep competent help. Potential employees may feel that there is no room for advance-
ment in a firm whose owner assumes all managerial responsibilities. And when those 
who are hired are ready to take on added responsibility, they may find that the only 
way to do so is to quit the sole proprietorship and go to work for a larger firm or start 
up their own businesses. The lure of higher salaries and increased benefits (especially 
health insurance) also may cause existing employees to change jobs.
Beyond the Sole Proprietorship
Like many others, you may decide that the major disadvantage of a sole proprietorship 
is the limited amount that one person can do in a workday. One way to reduce the 
effect of this disadvantage (and retain many of the advantages) is to have more than 
one owner.
Why Sell a Small Business to a Big Business?
Entrepreneurial
Success

Corey Capasso and Andrew Ferenci started 
Spinback in 2010 to help companies 
determine how social media connections 
were influencing sales. A year later, they had 
several large e-business customers and were ready for a major 
expansion, which meant raising more money. After discussing 
an alliance with Buddy Media, the co-founders realized that 
being acquired by Buddy Media was “a perfect fit,” Ferenci 
says. “We would be able to focus more on the nuts and bolts 
of the business” without having to spend time looking for 
additional financing. But, he cautions, entrepreneurs “need to 
make sure the acquiring company has a solid corporate culture 
and will be a good place to work.”
Aaron Patzer is another entrepreneur who let a big business 
acquire his small business, Mint.com, so he could keep 
improving operations and serving customers. Mint.com helps 
consumers manage their money online, and Patzer already 
had a million customers to consider when competitor Intuit 
approached him with an acquisition offer. The entrepreneur 
decided to sell, and became not only a millionaire but also 
a vice president at Intuit, bringing his employees to Intuit to 
keep running the business he had started. “They sort of left us 
alone to continue what we’re doing,” Patzer says of the post-
acquisition situation.

partnership  a voluntary 
association of two or more 
persons to act as co-owners of a

who assumes full or shared 
responsibility for operating a 
business
limited partner  a person who

has no management responsibility 
or liability for losses beyond the

Partnerships
A person who would not think of starting and running a sole proprietorship business 
alone may enthusiastically seize the opportunity to form a business partnership. The 
U.S. Uniform Partnership Act defines a partnership as a voluntary association of two 
or more persons to act as co-owners of a business for profit. For example, in 1990, 
two young African-American entrepreneurs named Janet Smith and Gary Smith started 
IVY Planning Group—a company that provides strategic planning and performance 
measurement for clients. Today, more than 20 years later, the company has evolved into 
a multimillion-dollar company that has hired a diverse staff of employees and provides 
cultural diversity training for Fortune 1000 firms, large not-for-profit organizations, 
and government agencies. In recognition of its efforts, IVY Planning Group has been 
recognized by DiversityBusiness.com as one of the top 50 minority-owned companies. 
And both Janet Smith and Gary Smith have been named “1 of 50 Influential Minorities 
in Business” by Minority Business and Professionals Network.2
As shown in Figures 4.1 and 4.2, there are approximately 3 million partnerships 
in the United States, and this type of ownership accounts for about $5 trillion in sales 
receipts each year. Note, however, that this form of ownership is much less common 
than the sole proprietorship or the corporation. In fact, as Figure 4.1 shows, partner-
ships represent only about 9 percent of all American businesses. Although there is no 
legal maximum on the number of partners a partnership may have, most have only two. 
Regardless of the number of people involved, a partnership often represents a pooling of 
special managerial skills and talents; at other times, it is the result of a sole proprietor 
taking on a partner for the purpose of obtaining more capital.
Types of Partners
All partners are not necessarily equal. Some may be active in running the business, 
whereas others may have a limited role.
General Partners  A general partner is a person who assumes full or shared respon-
sibility for operating a business. General partners are active in day-to-day business 
operations, and each partner can enter into contracts on behalf of the other partners. 
He or she also assumes unlimited liability for all debts, including debts incurred by any 
other general partner without his or her knowledge or consent. A 
general partnership is a business co-owned by two or more general 
partners who are liable for everything the business does. To avoid 
future liability, a general partner who withdraws from the partner-
ship must give notice to creditors, customers, and suppliers.
Limited Partners  A limited partner is a person who invests 
money in a business but who has no management responsibility 
or liability for losses beyond his or her investment in the partner-
ship. A limited partnership is a business co-owned by one or more 
general partners who manage the business and limited partners 
who invest money in it. Limited partnerships, for example, may be 
formed to finance real estate, oil and gas, motion picture, and other 
business ventures. Typically, the general partner or partners collect 
management fees and receive a percentage of profits. Limited part-
ners receive a portion of profits and tax benefits.
Because of potential liability problems, special rules apply to 
limited partnerships. These rules are intended to protect custom-
ers and creditors who deal with limited partnerships. For example, 
prospective partners in a limited partnership must file a formal 
declaration, usually with the secretary of state, that describes the 
essential details of the partnership and the liability status of each 
partner involved in the business. At least one general partner must

Sometimes it helps to have a famous partner with 
a proven track record. After leaving public office, 
former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani formed 
Giuliani Partners—a partnership with the accounting 
firm Ernst & Young. The objective of this partnership 
is to help business clients deal with the risks that stem 
from terrorism, crime, natural disasters, and other 
factors that threaten an organization’s ability to survive.

be responsible for the debts of the limited partnership. Also, some states prohibit the 
use of the limited partner’s name in the partnership’s name.
A special type of partnership is referred to as a master limited partnership. A 
­master limited partnership (MLP) (sometimes referred to as a publicly traded part-
nership, or PTP) is a limited partnership that has units of ownership that can be traded 
on security exchanges much like shares of ownership in a corporation. Generally, both 
general partners and limited partners are involved in an MLP. The general partners 
manage the business; the limited partners provide investment capital. This special 
ownership arrangement has two major advantages. First, units of ownership in MLPs 
can be sold to investors to raise capital. Because MLP units can be traded on an 
exchange, investors can sell their units of ownership at any time, hopefully for a profit. 
While there are exceptions, most MLPs typically are in natural resources, energy, or 
real estate-related businesses.3 Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, for example, is one 
of the largest publicly traded pipeline master limited partnerships in America. For 
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, ownership units are traded on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Second, income from MLPs is generally reported as the personal income 
of the owners. MLPs thus avoided the double taxation paid on corporate income. 
For more information on the advantages and disadvantages of the MLP form of 
ownership, visit the National Association of Publicly Traded Partnerships Web site at  
www.naptp.org.
The Partnership Agreement
Articles of partnership  refers to an agreement listing and explaining the terms of the 
partnership. Although both oral and written partnership agreements are legal and can 
be enforced in the courts, a written agreement has an obvious advantage. It is not 
subject to lapses of memory.
Figure 4.3 shows a typical partnership agreement. The partnership agreement 
should state
●
●Who will make the final decisions
●
●What each partner’s duties will be
●
●The investment each partner will make
●
●How much profit or loss each partner receives or is responsible for
●
●What happens if a partner wants to dissolve the partnership or dies
Although the people involved in a partnership can draft their own agreement, most 
experts recommend consulting an attorney.
When entering into a partnership agreement, partners would be wise to let a neu-
tral third party—a consultant, an accountant, a lawyer, or a mutual friend—assist with 
any disputes that might arise.
Advantages and Disadvantages of 
Partnerships
When compared to sole proprietorships and corporations, partnerships are the 
least popular form of business ownership. Still there are situations when forming a 
partnership makes perfect sense. Before you make a decision to form a partnership, 
all the people involved should consider both the advantages and disadvantages of a 
partnership.
Advantages of Partnerships
Partnerships have many advantages. The most important are described as follows.
Ease of Start-Up  Partnerships are relatively easy to form. As with a sole proprietor-
ship, the legal requirements often are limited to registering the name of the business

and obtaining any necessary licenses or permits. It may not even be necessary to pre-
pare written articles of partnership, although doing so is generally a good idea.
Availability of Capital and Credit  Because partners can pool their funds, a part-
nership usually has more capital available than a sole proprietorship does. This addi-
tional capital, coupled with the general partners’ unlimited liability, may encourage 
banks and suppliers to extend more credit or approve larger loans to a partnership 
than to a sole proprietor. This does not mean that partnerships can borrow all the 
money they need. Many partnerships have found it hard to get long-term financing 
simply because lenders worry about the possibility of management disagreements and 
lack of continuity.
Personal Interest  General partners are very concerned with the operation of the 
firm—perhaps even more so than sole proprietors. After all, they are responsible for the 
actions of all other general partners, as well as for their own. The pride of ownership

Articles of Partnership
The articles of partnership is a written or oral agreement  
that lists and explains the terms of a partnership.
PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT
This agreement, made June 20, 2012, between Penelope Wolfburg of 783A South Street, 
Hazelton, Idaho, and Ingrid Swenson of RR 5, Box 96, Hazelton, Idaho.
1. The above named persons have this day formed a partnership that shall operate  
 
under the name of W-S Jewelers, located at 85 Broad Street, Hazelton, Idaho  
 
83335, and shall engage in jewelry sales and repairs.
2. The duration of this agreement will be for a term of ﬁfteen (15) years, beginning  
 
June 20, 2012, or for a shorter period if agreed upon in writing by both partners.

from solving the day-to-day problems of operating a business—
with the help of another person(s)—is a strong motivating force 
and often makes all the people involved in the partnership work 
harder to become more successful.
Combined Business Skills and Knowledge  Partners often 
have complementary skills. The weakness of one partner—in manu-
facturing, for example—may be offset by another partner’s strength 
in that area. Moreover, the ability to discuss important decisions 
with another concerned individual often relieves some pressure and 
leads to more effective decision making.
Retention of Profits  As in a sole proprietorship, all profits 
belong to the owners of the partnership. The partners share directly 
in the financial rewards and therefore are highly motivated to do 
their best to make the firm succeed. As noted, the partnership agree-
ment should state how much profit or loss each partner receives or 
is responsible for.
No Special Taxes  Although a partnership pays no income tax, 
the Internal Revenue Service requires partnerships to file an annual 
information return that states the names and addresses of all part-
ners involved in the business. The return also must provide infor-
mation about income and expenses and distributions made to each partner. Then each 
partner is required to report his or her share of profit (or loss) from the partnership 
on his or her individual tax return. Ultimately each partner’s share of the partnership 
profit is taxed in the same way a sole proprietor is taxed.
Disadvantages of Partnerships
Although partnerships have many advantages when compared with sole proprietorships 
and corporations, they also have some disadvantages, which anyone thinking of 
forming a partnership should consider.
Unlimited Liability  As we have noted, each general partner has unlimited liability 
for all debts of the business. Each partner is legally and personally responsible for the 
debts, taxes, and actions of any other partner conducting partnership business, even 
if that partner did not incur those debts or do anything wrong. General partners thus 
run the risk of having to use their personal assets to pay creditors. Limited partners, 
however, risk only their original investment.
Today, many states allow partners to form a limited-liability partnership (LLP), in 
which a partner may have limited-liability protection from legal action resulting from 
the malpractice or negligence of the other partners. Many states that allow LLPs restrict 
this type of ownership to certain types of professionals such as accountants, architects, 
attorneys, and similar professionals. (Note the difference between a limited partnership 
and a limited-liability partnership. A limited partnership must have at least one general 
partner that has unlimited liability. On the other hand, all partners in a limited-liability 
partnership may have limited liability for the malpractice of the other partners.)
Management Disagreements  What happens to a partnership if one of the part-
ners brings a spouse or a relative into the business? What happens if a partner wants 
to withdraw more money from the business? Notice that each of these situations—and 
for that matter, most of the other problems that can develop in a partnership—involves 
one partner doing something that disturbs the other partner(s). This human factor is 
especially important because business partners—with egos, ambitions, and money on 
the line—are especially susceptible to friction. When partners begin to disagree about 
Two entrepreneurs with one goal. There is a special 
pride of ownership that takes place when two people 
are solving problems and working together for the 
same purpose. Being responsible for what happens to 
the company—as well as your business partner—can be 
a motivating force for working that much harder to be 
successful.

Part 2   Business Ownership and Entrepreneurship
decisions, policies, or ethics, distrust may build and get worse as time passes—often to 
the point where it is impossible to operate the business successfully.
Lack of Continuity  Partnerships are terminated if any one of the general partners 
dies, withdraws, or is declared legally incompetent. However, the remaining partners 
can purchase that partner’s ownership share. For example, the partnership agreement 
may permit surviving partners to continue the business after buying a deceased part-
ner’s interest from his or her estate. However, if the partnership loses an owner whose 
specific management or technical skills cannot be replaced, it is not likely to survive.
Frozen Investment  It is easy to invest money in a partnership, but it is sometimes 
quite difficult to get it out. This is the case, for example, when remaining partners are 
unwilling to buy the share of the business that belongs to a partner who retires or 
wants to relocate to another city. To avoid such difficulties, the partnership agreement 
should include some procedure for buying out a partner.
In some cases, a partner must find someone outside the firm to buy his or her 
share. How easy or difficult it is to find an outsider depends on how successful the 
business is and how willing existing partners are to accept a new partner.
Beyond the Partnership
The main advantages of a partnership over a sole proprietorship are increased 
availability of capital and credit and the combined business skills and knowledge of 
the partners. However, some of the basic disadvantages of the sole proprietorship also 
plague the general partnership. One disadvantage in particular—unlimited liability—
can cause problems for a partner with substantial personal wealth. A third form of 
business ownership, the corporation, overcomes this disadvantage.
Corporations
Back in 1837, William Procter and James Gamble—two sole proprietors—formed a 
partnership called Procter & Gamble (P&G) and set out to compete with 14 other soap 
and candle makers in Cincinnati, Ohio. Then, in 1890, Procter & Gamble incorporated to 
raise additional capital for expansion that eventually allowed the company to become a 
global giant. Today, P&G brands serve over 4 billion of the 7 billion people in the world 
today because the corporation operates in 180 countries around the globe.4 Like many 
large corporations, P&G’s market capitalization is greater than the gross domestic product 
of many countries. Although this corporation is a corporate giant, the firm’s executives 
and employees believe it also has a responsibility to be an ethical corporate citizen. For 
example, P&G’s purpose statement (or mission) is
We will provide branded products and services of superior quality and value that 
improve the lives of the world’s consumers, now and for generations to come. As 
a result, consumers will reward us with leadership sales, profit and value creation, 
allowing our people, our shareholders and the communities in which we live and 
work to prosper.5
In today’s competitive environment, it’s common to hear of large companies that 
are profitable. It is less common to hear of profitable companies that are held in high 
regard because they are good corporate citizens.
While not all sole proprietorships and partnerships become corporations, there 
are reasons why business owners choose the corporate form of ownership. Let’s begin 
with a definition of a corporation. Perhaps the best definition of a corporation was 
given by Chief Justice John Marshall in a famous Supreme Court decision in 1819.

corporation  an artificial person 
created by law with most of the 
legal rights of a real person, 
including the rights to start and 
operate a business, to buy or sell 
property, to borrow money, to 
sue or be sued, and to enter into 
binding contracts
stock  the shares of ownership of 
a corporation
stockholder  a person who owns 
a corporation’s stock
closed corporation  a 
corporation whose stock is owned 
by relatively few people and is not 
sold to the general public
open corporation  a corporation 
whose stock can be bought and 
sold by any individual
A corporation, he said, “is an artificial person, invisible, intangible, 
and existing only in contemplation of the law.” In other words, a 
corporation (sometimes referred to as a regular or C-corporation) 
is an artificial person created by law, with most of the legal rights 
of a real person. These include:
●
●The right to start and operate a business
●
●The right to buy or sell property
●
●The right to borrow money
●
●The right to sue or be sued
●
●The right to enter into binding contracts
Unlike a real person, however, a corporation exists only on 
paper. There are approximately 6 million corporations in the United 
States. They comprise about 19 percent of all businesses, but they 
account for 81 percent of sales revenues (see Figures 4.1 and 4.2).
Corporate Ownership
The shares of ownership of a corporation are called stock. The 
people who own a corporation’s stock—and thus own part of the 
corporation—are called stockholders. Once a corporation has 
been formed, it may sell its stock to individuals or other companies 
that want to invest in the corporation. It also may issue stock as 
a reward to key employees in return for certain services or as a return to investors in 
place of cash payments.
A closed corporation is a corporation whose stock is owned by relatively few 
people and is not sold to the general public. As an example, Mars—the company 
famous for M&Ms, Snickers, Dove, Milky Way, Twix, and other chocolate candy—is 
a privately held, family-owned, closed corporation. Although many people think that 
a closed corporation is a small company, there are exceptions. Mars, for example, has 
annual sales of more than $30 billion, employs more than 65,000 associates world-
wide, and operates in 70 different countries.6
An open corporation is one whose stock can be bought and sold by any indi-
vidual. Examples of open corporations include General Electric, Microsoft, Apple, and 
Sony.
Forming a Corporation
Although you may think that incorporating a business guarantees success, it does not. 
There is no special magic about placing the word Incorporated or the abbreviation Inc. 
after the name of a business. Unfortunately, like sole proprietorships or partnerships, 
corporations can go broke. The decision to incorporate a business therefore should be 
made only after carefully considering whether the corporate form of ownership suits 
your needs better than the sole proprietorship or partnership forms.
If you decide that the corporate form is the best form of organization for you, most 
experts recommend that you begin the incorporation process by consulting a lawyer to 
be sure that all legal requirements are met. While it may be possible to incorporate a 
business without legal help, it is well to keep in mind the old saying, “A man who acts 
as his own attorney has a fool for a client.” Table 4.1 lists some aspects of starting and 
running a business that may require legal help.
Where to Incorporate  A business is allowed to incorporate in any state that it 
chooses. Most small- and medium-sized businesses are incorporated in the state where 
they do the most business. The founders of larger corporations or of those that will 
do business nationwide often compare the benefits that various states provide to cor-
porations. The decision on where to incorporate usually is based on two factors: (1) 
the cost of incorporating in one state compared with the cost in another state and 
Procter & Gamble: Once a sole proprietorship, 
then a partnership, and now a very large 
corporation. Although one of the largest 
corporations in the world, P&G was started when two 
sole proprietors formed a partnership to sell soap 
and candles. Today the corporation’s product line 
has expanded and it now operates in 180 different 
countries around the globe.

(2) the advantages and disadvantages of each state’s corporate laws and tax structure. 
Some states are more hospitable than others, and some offer fewer restrictions, lower 
taxes, and other benefits to attract new firms. Delaware, Nevada, and Wyoming are 
often chosen by corporations that do business in more than one state because of their 
corporation-friendly laws and pro-business climate.7
An incorporated business is called a domestic corporation in the state in which it is 
incorporated. In all other states where it does business, it is called a foreign corporation. 
Sears Holdings Corporation, the parent company of Sears and Kmart, is incorporated 
in Delaware, where it is a domestic corporation. In the remaining 49 states, Sears 
is a foreign corporation. Sears must register in all states where it does business and 
also pay taxes and annual fees to each state. A corporation chartered by a foreign 
government and conducting business in the United States is an alien corporation. 
Volkswagen AG, Sony Corporation, and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group are examples of 
alien corporations.
The Corporate Charter  Once a home state has been chosen, the incorporator(s) 
submits articles of incorporation to the secretary of state. When the articles of incor-
poration are approved, they become a contract between a corporation and the state in 
which the state recognizes the formation of the artificial person that is the corporation. 
Usually, the articles of incorporation include the following information:
●
●The firm’s name and address
●
●The incorporators’ names and addresses
●
●The purpose of the corporation
●
●The maximum amount of stock and types of stock to be issued
●
●The rights and privileges of stockholders
●
●The length of time the corporation is to exist
To help you to decide if the corporate form of organization is the right choice, you 
may want to visit the library for more information on the incorporation process. You 
can also use an Internet search engine and enter the term “business incorporation” for 
useful Web sites. In addition, before making a decision to organize your business as a 
corporation, you may want to consider two additional areas: stockholders’ rights and 
the importance of the organizational meeting.
Stockholders’ Rights  There are two basic types of stock. Owners of common 
stock may vote on corporate matters. Generally, an owner of common stock has one 
vote for each share owned. However, any claims of common-stock owners on profits, 
dividends, and assets of the corporation are paid after the claims of others. The owners

dividend  a distribution of 
earnings to the stockholders of a 
corporation

to be decided at a stockholders’ 
meeting and enabling stockholders 
to transfer their voting rights 
to some other individual or 
individuals

the members of which are elected 
by the stockholders
of preferred stock usually have no voting rights, but 
their claims on dividends are paid before those of com-
mon-stock owners. Although large corporations may 
issue both common and preferred stock, generally small 
corporations issue only common stock.
Perhaps the most important right of owners of both 
common and preferred stock is to share in the profit 
earned by the corporation through the payment of divi-
dends. A dividend is a distribution of earnings to the 
stockholders of a corporation. Other rights include receiv-
ing information about the corporation, voting on changes to the 
corporate charter, and attending the corporation’s annual stock-
holders’ meeting, where they may exercise their right to vote.
Because common stockholders usually live all over the 
nation, very few actually may attend a corporation’s annual 
meeting. Instead, they vote by proxy. A proxy is a legal form 
listing issues to be decided at a stockholders’ meeting and 
enabling stockholders to transfer their voting rights to some 
other individual or individuals. The stockholder can register a 
vote and transfer voting rights simply by signing and returning 
the form. Today, most corporations also allow stockholders to 
exercise their right to vote by proxy by accessing the Internet 
or using a toll-free phone number.
Organizational Meeting  As the last step in forming a cor-
poration, the incorporators and original stockholders meet to 
adopt corporate by-laws and elect their first board of directors. 
(Later, directors will be elected or reelected at the corporation’s 
annual meetings by the firm’s stockholders.) The board members are directly respon-
sible to the stockholders for the way they operate the firm.
Corporate Structure
The organizational structure of most corporations is more complicated than that of a 
sole proprietorship or partnership. In a corporation, both the board of directors and 
the corporate officers are involved in management.
Board of Directors  As an artificial person, a corporation can act only through 
its directors, who represent the corporation’s stockholders. The board of directors 
is the top governing body of a corporation and is elected by the stockholders. In 
theory, then, the stockholders are able to control the activities of the entire corpora-
tion through its directors because they are the group that elects the board of directors 
(see Figure 4.4)
Board members can be chosen from within the corporation or from outside it. 
Note: For a small corporation, only one director is required in many states although 
you can choose to have more. Directors who are elected from within the corpora-
tion are usually its top managers—the president and executive vice presidents, for 
Personal
Apps
Even if you own a single share of common stock, you’re 
legally a part-owner of the corporation. You’re entitled to 
receive any dividends paid to shareholders and you can 
vote on important matters such as electing the board of 
directors. Your vote is counted—and it counts.

example. Those elected from outside the corporation generally are 
experienced managers or entrepreneurs with proven leadership 
ability and/or specific talents the organization seems to need. In 
smaller corporations, majority stockholders usually serve as board 
members.
The major responsibilities of the board of directors are to set 
company goals and develop general plans (or strategies) for meet-
ing those goals. The board also is responsible for the firm’s overall 
operation and appointing corporate officers.
Corporate Officers  Corporate officers are appointed by the 
board of directors. Although a small corporation may not have 
all of the following officers, the chairman of the board, president, 
executive vice presidents, corporate secretary, and treasurer are all 
corporate officers. They help the board to make plans, carry out 
strategies established by the board, hire employees, and manage 
day-to-day business activities. Periodically (usually each month), 
they report to the board of directors. And at the annual meeting, 
the directors report to the stockholders.
Advantages and Disadvantages  
of Corporations
Back in October 2000, Manny Ruiz decided that it was time to start his own company. 
With the help of a team of media specialists, he founded Hispanic PR Wire. In a 
business where hype is the name of the game, Hispanic PR Wire is the real thing and 
has established itself as the nation’s premier news distribution service reaching U.S. 
Hispanic media and opinion leaders. Today, the business continues to build on its early 
success.8 Mr. Ruiz chose to incorporate this business because it provided a number of 
advantages that other forms of business ownership did not offer. Typical advantages 
include limited liability, ease of raising capital, ease of transfer of ownership, perpetual 
life, and specialized management.

managers. In many cases, women handle negotiations differently 
than men do, their careers follow slightly different paths, and 
their leadership styles may differ, as well. All these differences can 
be strengths as boards grapple with internal and external issues.
On the other hand, few women have risen to the top 
management ranks of U.S. corporations, which means that 
boards must widen their search to find women directors. 
Also, boards scouting for directors generally look for the best 
candidates with top-notch skills, education, and achievements, 
putting much less weight on gender. Should U.S. corporations 
take deliberate steps to bring more women into the board room?

world’s highest percentage of women directors (more than  
30 percent), followed by Sweden (more than 25 percent). 
Then again, Norway’s laws require that 40 percent of direc-

limited liability  a feature of 
corporate ownership that limits 
each owner’s financial liability to 
the amount of money that he or 
she has paid for the corporation’s 
stock
Advantages of Corporations
Limited Liability  One of the most attractive features of cor-
porate ownership is limited liability. With few exceptions, each 
­owner’s financial liability is limited to the amount of money he or 
she has paid for the corporation’s stock. This feature arises from 
the fact that the corporation is itself a legal person, separate from 
its owners. If a corporation fails or is involved in a lawsuit and 
loses, creditors have a claim only on the corporation’s assets, not 
on the stockholders’ (owners’) personal assets. Because it over-
comes the problem of unlimited liability connected with sole pro-
prietorships and general partnerships, limited liability is one of the 
chief reasons why entrepreneurs often choose the corporate form 
of organization.
Ease of Raising Capital  The corporation is one of the most 
effective forms of business ownership for raising capital. Like sole 
proprietorships and partnerships, corporations can borrow from 
lending institutions. However, they also can raise additional sums 
of money by selling stock. Individuals are more willing to invest 
in corporations than in other forms of business because of limited 
liability, and they can generally sell their stock easily—hopefully 
for a profit.
Ease of Transfer of Ownership  Accessing a brokerage firm Web site or a tele-
phone call to a stockbroker is all that is required to put most stock up for sale. Willing 
buyers are available for most stocks at the market price. Ownership is transferred 
when the sale is made, and practically no restrictions apply to the sale and purchase of 
stock issued by an open corporation.
Perpetual Life  Since it is essentially a legal “person,” a corporation exists inde-
pendently of its owners and survives them. The withdrawal, death, or incompetence 
of a key executive or owner does not cause the corporation to be terminated. Sears, 
Roebuck and Co. incorporated in 1893 and is one of the nation’s largest retailing 
corporations, even though its original co-founders, Richard Sears and Alvah Roebuck, 
have been dead for decades.
Specialized Management  Typically, corporations are able to recruit more skilled, 
knowledgeable, and talented managers than proprietorships and partnerships. This is 
so because they pay bigger salaries, offer excellent employee benefits, and are large 
enough to offer considerable opportunity for advancement. Within the corporate struc-
ture, administration, human resources, finance, marketing, and operations are placed 
in the charge of experts in these fields.
Disadvantages of Corporations
Like its advantages, many of a corporation’s disadvantages stem from its legal definition 
as an artificial person or legal entity. The most serious disadvantages are described in 
the following text. (See Table 4.2 for a comparison of some of the advantages and 
disadvantages of a sole proprietorship, general partnership, and corporation.)
Difficulty and Expense of Formation  Forming a corporation can be a relatively 
complex and costly process. The use of an attorney is usually necessary to complete 
the legal forms that are submitted to the secretary of state. Application fees, attor-
ney’s fees, registration costs associated with selling stock, and other organizational 
costs can amount to thousands of dollars for even a medium-sized corporation. 
Would you buy stock in Facebook? Facebook—the 
company that started in a Harvard University dorm 
room back in 2004—finally sold stock to the general 
public in 2012. The money raised from the public 
stock offering can be used to “grow” the company. 
For investors, it was a chance to “cash in” on the 
phenomenal success of the world’s most recognized 
social media company.

Part 2   Business Ownership and Entrepreneurship
The costs of incorporating, in terms of both time and 
money, discourage many owners of smaller businesses 
from forming corporations.
Government Regulation and Increased Paper­
work   A corporation must meet various government 
standards before it can sell its stock to the public. Then 
it must file many reports on its business operations and 
finances with local, state, and federal governments. In 
addition, the corporation must make periodic reports to 
its stockholders about various aspects of the business. To pre-
pare all the necessary reports, even small corporations often 
need the help of an attorney, certified public accountant, and 
other professionals on a regular basis. In addition, a corpora-
tion’s activities are restricted by law to those spelled out in its 
charter.
Conflict Within the Corporation  Because a large corpo-
ration may employ thousands of employees, some conflict is 
inevitable. For example, the pressure to increase sales revenue, 
reduce expenses, and increase profits often leads to increased 
stress and tension for both managers and employees. This 
is especially true when a corporation operates in a competi-
tive industry, attempts to develop and market new products, 
or must downsize the workforce to reduce employee salary 
expense during an economic crisis.
Double Taxation  Corporations must pay a tax on their 
profits. In addition, stockholders must pay a personal income 
tax on profits received as dividends. Corporate profits thus are 
taxed twice—once as corporate income and a second time as the 
personal income of stockholders. Note: Both the S-corporation 
and the limited-liability company discussed in the next section 
eliminate the disadvantage of double taxation because they are 
taxed like a partnership.
Lack of Secrecy  Because open corporations are required to 
submit detailed reports to government agencies and to stock-
holders, they cannot keep their operations confidential. Competitors can study these 
corporate reports and then use the information to compete more effectively. In effect, 
every public corporation has to share some of its secrets with its competitors.

S-corporation  a corporation 
that is taxed as though it were a 
partnership
limited-liability company 
(LLC)  a form of business 
ownership that combines the 
benefits of a corporation and 
a partnership while avoiding 
some of the restrictions and 
disadvantages of those forms of 
ownership
Special Types of Business Ownership
In addition to the sole proprietorship, partnership, and the regular corporate form 
of organization, some entrepreneurs choose other forms of organization that meet 
their special needs. Additional organizational options include S-corporations, limited-
liability companies, and not-for-profit corporations.
S-Corporations
If a corporation meets certain requirements, its directors may apply to the Internal 
Revenue Service for status as an S-corporation. An S-corporation is a corporation that 
is taxed as though it were a partnership. In other words, the corporation’s income is 
taxed only as the personal income of its stockholders. Corporate profits or losses “pass 
through” the business and are reported on the owners’ personal income tax returns.
To qualify for the special status of an S-corporation, a firm must meet the follow-
ing criteria:9 
	 1.	No more than 100 stockholders are allowed.
	 2.	Stockholders must be individuals, estates, or certain trusts.
	 3.	There can be only one class of outstanding stock.
	 4.	The firm must be a domestic corporation eligible to file for S-corporation status.
	 5.	There can be no partnerships, corporations, or nonresident-alien stockholders.
	 6.	All stockholders must agree to the decision to form an S-corporation.
Becoming an S-corporation can be an effective way to avoid double taxation while 
retaining the corporation’s legal benefit of limited liability.
Limited-Liability Companies
A new form of ownership called a limited-liability company has been approved in all 
50 states—although each state’s laws may differ. A limited-liability company (LLC) 
is a form of business ownership that combines the benefits of a corporation and a 
partnership while avoiding some of the restrictions and disadvantages of those forms 
of ownership. Chief advantages of an LLC are as follows:
	 1.	Like a sole proprietorship or partnership, an LLC enjoys pass-through taxation. 
This means that owners report their share of profits or losses in the company 
on their individual tax returns and avoid the double taxation 
imposed on most corporations. LLCs with at least two mem-
bers are taxed like a partnership. LLCs with just one member 
are taxed like a sole proprietorship. LLCs can even elect to be 
taxed as a corporation if there are benefits to offset the corpo-
rate double taxation.
	 2.	Like a corporation, it provides limited-liability protection for 
acts and debts of the LLC. An LLC thus extends the concept of 
personal-asset protection to small business owners.
	 3.	The LLC type of organization provides more management flex-
ibility when compared with corporations. A corporation, for 
example, is required to hold annual meetings and record meet-
ing minutes; an LLC is not.
Although many experts believe that the LLC is nothing more 
than a variation of the S-corporation, there is a difference. An LLC 
is not restricted to 100 stockholders—a common drawback of the 
S-corporation. LLCs are also less restricted and have more flex-
ibility than S-corporations in terms of who can become an owner. 
Although the owners of an LLC may file the required articles of 
organization in any state, most choose to file in their home state—
the state where they do most of their business.
Examine special types of 
corporations, including 
S-corporations, limited-
liability companies, and ­ 
not-for-profit corporations.

Part 2   Business Ownership and Entrepreneurship
not-for-profit corporation  a 
corporation organized to provide 
a social, educational, religious, or 
other service rather than to earn a 
profit
Even though most LLCs are small to medium-sized businesses, a limited-liability 
company doesn’t have to be small. American Girl Brands—a limited-liability company 
that sells dolls, clothing, furniture, books, and magazines for the popular American 
Girl product lines—chose the LLC type of business ownership because it provided 
limited liability for investors and avoided some of the restrictions and disadvantages 
of other forms of business ownership.
Because of the increased popularity of the LLC form of organization, experts 
are predicting that LLCs may become one of the most popular forms of ­business 
ownership available. For more information about the benefits of forming an LLC, 
go to www.llc.com/LLC_Benefits.html. For help in understanding the differences 
between a regular corporation, S-corporation, and limited-liability company, see 
Table 4.3.
Not-for-Profit Corporations
A not-for-profit corporation (sometimes referred to as non-profit) is a corporation 
organized to provide a social, educational, religious, or other service rather than to 
earn a profit. Various charities, museums, private schools, colleges, and charitable 
organizations are organized in this way, primarily to ensure limited liability.
While the process used to organize a not-for-profit corporation is similar to the 
process used to create a regular corporation, each state does have different laws. In 
fact, many of the requirements are different than the requirements for establishing a 
regular corporation. Once approved by state authorities, not-for-profit corporations 
must meet specific Internal Revenue Service guidelines in order to obtain tax-exempt 
status.
Today, there is a renewed interest in not-for-profits because these organizations 
are formed to improve communities and change lives. For example, Habitat for 
Humanity is a not-for-profit corporation and was formed to provide homes for quali-
fied lower income people who cannot afford housing. Even though this corporation 
may receive more money than it spends, any surplus funds are “reinvested” in building 
activities to provide low-cost housing to qualified individuals. Other examples of not-­ 
for-profit corporations include the SeaWorld and Busch Gardens Conservation Fund, 
the Girl Scouts, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and many local not-for-profits 
designed to meet specific needs within a community.

cooperative an association of 
individuals or firms whose purpose 
is to perform some business 
function for its members
joint venture  an agreement 
between two or more groups to 
form a business entity in order 
to achieve a specific goal or to 
operate for a specific period of 
time
syndicate  a temporary 
association of individuals or firms 
organized to perform a specific 
task that requires a large amount 
of capital
Many not-for-profit corporations operate in much the same way as for-profit 
businesses. Employees of not-for-profit businesses are responsible for making sure the 
organization achieves its goals and objectives, ensuring accountability for finances and 
donations, and monitoring activities to improve performance of both paid employees 
and volunteers. If you are interested in a business career, don’t rule out the non-profit 
sector. You might consider volunteering your time and effort in a local not-for-profit 
organization to see if you enjoy this type of challenge.
Cooperatives, Joint Ventures,  
and Syndicates
Today, three additional types of business organizations—cooperatives, joint ventures, 
and syndicates—are used for special purposes. Each of these forms of organization is 
unique when compared with more traditional forms of business ownership.
Cooperatives
A cooperative is an association of individuals or firms whose purpose is to perform 
some business function for its members. The cooperative can perform its function more 
effectively than any member could by acting alone. For example, cooperatives purchase 
goods in bulk and distribute them to members; thus, the unit cost is lower than it 
would be if each member bought the goods in a much smaller quantity.
Although cooperatives are found in all segments of our economy, they are most 
prevalent in agriculture. Farmers use cooperatives to purchase supplies, to buy services 
such as trucking and storage, and to process and market their products. Ocean Spray 
Cranberries, Inc., for example, is a cooperative of some 700 cranberry growers and 
about 50 citrus growers spread throughout the country and is North America’s leading 
producer of canned and bottled juices and juice drinks.10
Joint Ventures
A joint venture is an agreement between two or more groups to form a business entity 
in order to achieve a specific goal or to operate for a specific period of time. Both the 
scope of the joint venture and the liabilities of the people or businesses involved usually 
are limited to one project. Once the goal is reached, the period of time elapses, or the 
project is completed, the joint venture is dissolved.
Corporations, as well as individuals, may enter into joint ventures. Major oil pro-
ducers often have formed a number of joint ventures to share the extremely high cost 
of exploring for offshore petroleum deposits. And many U.S. companies are forming 
joint ventures with foreign firms in order to enter new markets around the globe. For 
example, Walmart has joined forces with India’s Bharti Enterprises to establish whole-
sale cash-and-carry stores that sell directly to local retailers in different cities and towns 
in India. Plans are for each store to offer an assortment of approximately 6,000 items 
including food and nonfood items at competitive wholesale prices, allowing retailers 
and small business owners to lower their cost of operation. By the beginning of 2012, 
the Bharti Walmart joint venture had opened 14 cash-and-carry stores and employed 
over 3,000 associates.11
Syndicates
A syndicate is a temporary association of individuals or firms organized to perform 
a specific task that requires a large amount of capital. The syndicate is formed 
because no one person or firm is willing to put up the entire amount required for the 
undertaking. Like a joint venture, a syndicate is dissolved as soon as its purpose has 
been accomplished.
Discuss the purpose of a 
cooperative, joint venture, 
and syndicate.

Syndicates are used most commonly to underwrite large insurance policies, 
loans, and investments. To share the risk of default, banks have formed syndi-
cates to provide loans to developing countries. Stock brokerage firms usually join 
together in the same way to market a new issue of stock. In May 2012 and after 
years of anticipation in the investment world, Facebook sold stock to investors. 
Facebook—the world’s leading social media Web site—raised $16 billion with the 
help of a syndicate of Wall Street firms including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, 
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs.12 This initial public 
offering, often referred to as an IPO, is one of the largest in recent history. (An 
initial public offering is the term used to describe the first time a corporation sells 
stock to the general public.)
Corporate Growth
Growth seems to be a basic characteristic of business. One reason for seeking 
growth has to do with profit: A larger firm generally has greater sales revenue and 
thus greater profit. Another reason is that in a growing economy, a business that 
does not grow is actually shrinking relative to the economy. A third reason is that 
business growth is a means by which some executives boost their power, prestige, 
and reputation.
Growth poses new problems and requires additional resources that first must be 
available and then must be used effectively. The main ingredient in growth is capital—
and as we have noted, capital is most readily available to corporations.
Growth from Within
Most corporations grow by expanding their present operations. Some introduce and 
sell new but related products. Others expand the sale of present products to new 
geographic markets or to new groups of consumers in geographic markets already 
served. Although Walmart was started by Sam Walton in 1962 with one discount 
store, today Walmart has over 10,000 stores in the United States and 27 other 
countries and has long-range plans for expanding into additional international 
markets.13
Growth from within, especially when carefully planned and controlled, can have 
relatively little adverse effect on a firm. For the most part, the firm continues to do 
what it has been doing, but on a larger scale. For instance, Larry Ellison, co-founder 
and CEO of Oracle Corporation of Redwood Shores, California, built the firm’s annual 
revenues up from a mere $282 million in 1988 to approximately $36 billion today.14 
Much of this growth has taken place over the last 15 years as Oracle capitalized on its 
global leadership in information management software.
Growth Through Mergers and Acquisitions
Another way a firm can grow is by purchasing another company. The purchase of 
one corporation by another is called a merger. An acquisition is essentially the same 
thing as a merger, but the term usually is used in reference to a large corporation’s 
purchases of other corporations. Although most mergers and acquisitions are 
friendly, hostile takeovers also occur. A hostile takeover is a situation in which 
the management and board of directors of a firm targeted for acquisition disapprove 
of the merger.
When a merger or acquisition becomes hostile, a corporate raider—another com-
pany or a wealthy investor—may make a tender offer or start a proxy fight to gain 
control of the target company. A tender offer is an offer to purchase the stock of 
a firm targeted for acquisition at a price just high enough to tempt stockholders to 
sell their shares. Corporate raiders also may initiate a proxy fight. A proxy fight is

within and growth through 
mergers can enable a business

a technique used to gather enough stockholder votes to control a 
targeted company.
If the corporate raider is successful and takes over the targeted 
company, existing management usually is replaced. Faced with 
this probability, existing management may take specific actions, 
sometimes referred to as “poison pills,” “shark repellents,” or 
“porcupine provisions,” to maintain control of the firm and avoid 
the hostile takeover. Whether mergers are friendly or hostile, they 
are generally classified as horizontal, vertical, or conglomerate 
(see Figure 4.5).
Horizontal Mergers  A horizontal merger is a merger between 
firms that make and sell similar products or services in similar mar-
kets. The proposed merger between AT&T and T-Mobile was an 
example of a horizontal merger because both firms provide cell 
phone service to their customers. This type of merger tends to 
reduce the number of firms in an industry—and thus may reduce 
competition. As a result most horizontal mergers are reviewed 
carefully by federal agencies before they are approved in order to 
protect competition in the marketplace. In fact, the AT&T merger 
with T-Mobile was effectively blocked when the U.S. Department 
of Justice filed a law suit to block the merger. According to the Department of Justice, 
the main reason behind the government’s legal action was to protect the competitive 
environment and the consumers’ right to choose. Rather than fight the government’s 
attempt to block the merger, AT&T withdrew its offer to acquire T-Mobile.
Vertical Mergers  A vertical merger is a merger between firms that operate at 
different but related levels in the production and marketing of a product. Generally, 
one of the merging firms is either a supplier or a customer of the other. A vertical

in the process of building the next generation of news-reader software that had a 
unique approach to summarizing the most important information from social media 
feeds from Google, Facebook, and Twitter. Rather than develop its own software to 
summarize the most important information, Twitter simply purchased the Summify 
company.15
Conglomerate Mergers  A conglomerate merger takes place between firms in 
completely different industries. A conglomerate merger occurred when financial con-
glomerate Berkshire Hathaway acquired Wesco Financial Corporation. While both 
companies were recognized as successful companies that have a history of increasing 
sales revenues and profits, they operate in different industries. Berkshire Hathaway, led 
by its CEO Warren Buffett, has a long history of acquiring firms that have great finan-
cial potential. Wesco, on the other hand, is a smaller company with its main business 
interests in insurance, furniture rental, and steel.16 The Berkshire Hathaway–Wesco 
merger was friendly because it was beneficial for both firms. (Note: For more informa-
tion on the Berkshire Hathaway Corporation and its merger activities, read Case 4.2 
on page 130.)
Merger and Acquisition Trends for the Future
While there have always been mergers and acquisitions, the recent economic crisis has 
changed the dynamics of how and why firms merge. Recently, mergers and acquisitions 
have been fueled by the desire of financially secure firms to take over firms in financial 
trouble. For a firm experiencing financial difficulties, a merger or acquisition is 
often a better option than bankruptcy. During the recent economic crisis, this trend 
was especially evident in the financial services and banking industry. For example, 
Wachovia was purchased by Wells Fargo in order to avoid a Wachovia bank failure 
or a government takeover of Wachovia’s assets and loan portfolio. In other situations, 
a financially secure firm will purchase a company experiencing financial problems 
because it is a good investment.
Economists, financial analysts, corporate managers, and stockholders still hotly 
debate whether mergers and acquisitions are good for the economy—or for individual 
companies—in the long run. Takeover advocates argue that for companies that have 
been taken over, the purchasers have been able to make the company more profitable 
and productive by installing a new top-management team, by reducing expenses, and 
by forcing the company to concentrate on one main business.
Takeover opponents argue that takeovers do nothing to enhance corporate profit-
ability or productivity. These critics argue that the only people who benefit from take-
overs are investment bankers, brokerage firms, and takeover “artists,” who receive 
financial rewards by manipulating corporations rather than by producing tangible 
products or services.
Most experts now predict that mergers and acquisitions after the economic cri-
sis will be the result of cash-rich companies looking to acquire businesses that will 
enhance their position in the marketplace. Analysts also anticipate more mergers 
that involve companies or investors from other countries. Regardless of the com-
panies involved or where the companies are from, future mergers and acquisitions 
will be driven by solid business logic and the desire to compete in the international 
marketplace.
Whether they are sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, or some other 
form of business ownership, most U.S. businesses are small. In the next chapter, we 
focus on these small businesses. We examine, among other things, the meaning of the 
word small as it applies to business and the place of small business in the American 
economy.

Inside
Business
While Kimpton’s chef partners use their culinary talents to 
build the restaurant side of the business, its hotel experts 
focus on delivering personalized customer service, which 
requires a knowledgeable, dedicated workforce. Kimpton 
grooms future managers through a formal training pro-
gram and matches promising employees with experienced 
mentors to further develop their skills. Based on its many 
employee development and motivation programs, it has 
twice been named to the Fortune magazine list of “Best 
Companies to Work For.”
The company has also made environmental protection 
one of its top priorities. Following its Kimpton EarthCare 
plan, it has installed water-conservation systems in its 
hotels, expanded its recycling programs, and invested in 
energy-efficient equipment to save power. Going further, 
Kimpton works with the Nature Conservancy and the Trust 
for Public Land to raise money for environmental projects. 
The company isn’t finished growing—watch for more bou-
tique hotels and restaurants to open in the coming years.
Questions
1.	 Do you think Kimpton should switch from the LLC 
form of ownership to an open corporation to be able 
to raise money by selling shares of stock? Explain your 
answer.
2.	 Kimpton sometimes buys individual hotels from other 
companies, renovates them, and reopens them under 
a new name. Why would Kimpton do this rather than 
grow through a merger with a larger, more recognized 
hotel?

Summary
Describe the advantages and disadvantages of 
sole proprietorships.
In a sole proprietorship, all business profits become the property 
of the owner, but the owner is also personally responsible for 
all business debts. A successful sole proprietorship can be a 
great source of pride for the owner. When comparing different 
types of business ownership, the sole proprietorship is the 
simplest form of business to enter, control, and leave. It also 
pays no special taxes. Perhaps for these reasons, 72 percent 
of all American business firms are sole proprietorships. 
Sole proprietorships nevertheless have disadvantages, such 
as unlimited liability and limits on one person’s ability to 
borrow or to be an expert in all fields. As a result, this form 
of ownership accounts for only 4 percent of total revenues 
when compared with partnerships and corporations.
Explain the different types of partners and the 
importance of partnership agreements.
Like sole proprietors, general partners are responsible for 
running the business and for all business debts. Limited 
partners receive a share of the profit in return for investing 
in the business. However, they are not responsible for 
1
2
business debts beyond the amount they have invested. It is 
also possible to form a master limited partnership (MLP) 
and sell units of ownership to raise capital. Regardless of the 
type of partnership, it is always a good idea to have a written 
agreement (or articles of partnership) setting forth the terms 
of a partnership.
Describe the advantages and disadvantages of 
partnerships.
Although partnership eliminates some of the disadvantages 
of sole proprietorship, it is the least popular of the major 
forms of business ownership. The major advantages 
of a partnership include ease of start-up, availability 
of capital and credit, personal interest, combined skills 
and knowledge, retention of profits, and possible tax 
advantages. The effects of management disagreements are 
one of the major disadvantages of a partnership. Other 
disadvantages include unlimited liability (in a general 
partnership), lack of continuity, and frozen investment. 
By forming a limited partnership, the disadvantage of 
unlimited liability may be eliminated for the limited 
partner(s). This same disadvantage may be eliminated for 
partners that form a limited-liability partnership (LLP). 
Of course, special requirements must be met if partners 
form either the limited partnership or the limited-liability 
partnership.

Part 2   Business Ownership and Entrepreneurship
Summarize how a corporation is formed.
A corporation is an artificial person created by law, with most 
of the legal rights of a real person, including the right to start 
and operate a business, to buy or sell property, to borrow 
money, to be sued or sue, and to enter into contracts. With the 
corporate form of ownership, stock can be sold to individuals 
to raise capital. The people who own a corporation’s common 
or preferred stock are called stockholders. Stockholders are 
entitled to receive any dividends paid by the corporation, and 
common stockholders can vote either in person or by proxy. 
Generally, corporations are classified as closed corporations 
(few stockholders) or open corporations (many stockholders).
The process of forming a corporation is called incorpo-
ration. Most experts believe that the services of a lawyer are 
necessary when making decisions about where to incorpo-
rate and about obtaining a corporate charter, issuing stock, 
holding an organizational meeting, and all other legal details 
involved in incorporation. In theory, stockholders are able to 
control the activities of the corporation because they elect the 
board of directors who appoint the corporate officers.
Describe the advantages and disadvantages 
of a corporation.
Perhaps the major advantage of the corporate form is limited 
liability—stockholders are not liable for the corporation’s 
debts beyond the amount they paid for its stock. Other 
important advantages include ease of raising capital, ease 
of transfer of ownership, perpetual life, and specialized 
management. A major disadvantage of a large corporation 
is double taxation: All profits are taxed once as corporate 
income and again as personal income because stockholders 
must pay a personal income tax on the profits they receive 
as dividends. Other disadvantages include difficulty and 
expense of formation, government regulation, conflict within 
the corporation, and lack of secrecy.
Examine special types of corporations, including 
S-corporations, limited-liability companies, and 
not-for-profit corporations.
S-corporations are corporations that are taxed as though 
they were partnerships but that enjoy the benefit of limited 
liability. To qualify as an S-corporation, a number of criteria 
must be met. A limited-liability company (LLC) is a form of 
business ownership that provides limited liability and has 
fewer restrictions when compared to a regular corporation 
or an S-corporation. LLCs with at least two members are 
taxed like a partnership and thus avoid the double taxation 
imposed on most corporations. LLCs with just one member 
4
5
6
are taxed like a sole proprietorship. When compared with 
a regular corporation or an S-corporation, an LLC is more 
flexible. Not-for-profit corporations are formed to provide 
social services and to improve communities and change lives 
rather than to earn profits.
Discuss the purpose of a cooperative, joint 
venture, and syndicate.
Three additional forms of business ownership—the 
cooperative, joint venture, and syndicate—are used by 
their owners to meet special needs. A cooperative is an 
association of individuals or firms whose purpose is 
to perform some business function for its members. A 
joint venture is formed when two or more groups form 
a business entity in order to achieve a specific goal or 
to operate for a specific period of time. Once the goal 
is reached, the period of time elapses, or the project is 
completed, the joint venture is dissolved. A syndicate is a 
temporary association of individuals or firms organized 
to perform a specific task that requires large amounts of 
capital. Like a joint venture, a syndicate is dissolved as 
soon as its purpose has been accomplished.
Explain how growth from within and growth 
through mergers can enable a business to 
expand.
A corporation may grow by expanding its present operations 
or through a merger or an acquisition. Although most 
mergers are friendly, hostile takeovers also occur. A hostile 
takeover is a situation in which the management and board 
of directors of a firm targeted for acquisition disapprove of 
the merger. Mergers generally are classified as horizontal, 
vertical, or conglomerate.
During the recent economic crisis, mergers and acquisi-
tions have been fueled by the desire of financially secure firms 
to take over firms in financial trouble. For a firm experienc-
ing financial trouble, a merger or acquisition is often a bet-
ter option than bankruptcy. In other situations, a financially 
secure firm will purchase a company experiencing financial 
problems because it is a good investment.
While economists, financial analysts, corporate manag-
ers, and stockholders debate the merits of mergers, some 
trends should be noted. First, experts predict that future 
mergers will be the result of cash-rich companies looking 
to acquire businesses that will enhance their position in the 
marketplace. Second, more mergers are likely to involve for-
eign companies or investors. Third, mergers will be driven by 
business logic and the desire to compete in the international 
marketplace.

Review Questions
When it tried to buy T-Mobile for $39 billion in 2011, AT&T went 
so far as to offer the company a “break up” fee of $4 billion if 
the deal fell through. Why was AT&T so determined to purchase 
T-Mobile? AT&T was no. 2 in the wireless phone-service market. 
T-Mobile was no. 4. By merging, they would have become the 
nation’s largest wireless provider, surpassing Verizon. The deal 
would also have given AT&T access to the spectrum (airwaves) 
T-Mobile owned but couldn’t afford to upgrade to 4G (state-of-
the art, fourth-generation technology).
Executives at the companies said that in addition to creat-
ing jobs, the merger would result in fewer dropped calls and 
faster connection times for customers. The merged company 
would also be able to immediately expand wireless service to 
rural areas that lacked it. “AT&T will immediately gain cell sites 
equivalent to what would have taken on average five years to 
build without the transaction,” the two companies said in their 
merger announcement. The announcement also referred to a 
government report that showed that despite many mergers in 
the industry over the past decade, the price of wireless service 
had declined.
Investors cheered when they heard about the merger. However, 
many consumers, the Department of Justice, and the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) were wary of the deal. The 
merged company would have controlled nearly half of the mar-
ket. The only remaining big players in the industry would have 
been Verizon and Sprint. Some industry experts thought Sprint 
might get forced out of the market because it held the least mar-
ket share. They also believed few new companies would enter

the market. Competing against a combined AT&T and T-Mobile 
would make it too difficult.
What would the merger have meant for consumers? Dan 
Gillmor, the director of the Knight Center for Digital Media 
Entrepreneurship at Arizona State University, said he thought the 
deal would be bad for consumers. They would have fewer wire-
less providers to choose from, Gillmor said. He also predicted 
consumers could end up paying higher prices. “T-Mobile is the 
only company that’s now competing seriously on price,” he 
explained.
Researchers at the magazine Consumer Reports also concluded 
that T-Mobile charged less than many of its competitors for 
different types of plans. What firm would keep AT&T and its 
prices in check if it were to swallow up T-Mobile? Another issue 
was that a number of surveys had found that AT&T’s service 
quality was uneven. Would it get worse following the merger? 
Or better?
As you learned earlier in the chapter, the Department of 
Justice ultimately filed a lawsuit to block the merger. “The com-
bination of AT&T and T-Mobile would result in tens of millions 
of consumers all across the United States facing higher prices, 
fewer choices, and lower-quality products for mobile wireless 
services,” said Department of Justice Deputy Attorney General 
James M. Cole. And even though AT&T and T-Mobile claimed 
the merger would produce more jobs, an investigation by the 
FCC came to a different conclusion. The internal records of 
the two companies showed that the firms planned to lay off 
personnel by combining duplicate functions in their organiza-
tions such as their sales, management, and customer service 
departments. The FCC also disputed the companies’ claim that 
the merger would immediately expand wireless service to rural 
areas. Why? Because T-Mobile serviced mostly urban areas—not 
rural ones.
Acquiring T-Mobile became such an upward battle that AT&T 
eventually abandoned the effort and paid T-Mobile the $4 billion 
breakup fee. A few months later, T-Mobile announced it was spend-
ing $4 billion to expand and upgrade its network to 4G.17

3.	 Name some other examples of horizontal, vertical, and con-

When Warren Buffett started his first partnership more than 50 
years ago, he never dreamed he would wind up putting together 
a wildly diverse collection of businesses under one corporate 
umbrella. Originally, Buffett set up a series of partnerships with 
family and friends to pool cash for buying big blocks of stock 
in companies he had researched. Not all of Buffett’s stock picks 
paid off, but many were so successful that Buffett quickly earned 
a worldwide reputation for savvy investing.
Always looking for a good investment, Buffett turned his atten-
tion to the prospects of Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile 
manufacturer based in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Seeing 
value in the company’s heritage and its plans for making syn-
thetic fibers, Buffett began buying its stock. Once he controlled 
the mills, Buffett put one of Berkshire Hathaway’s executives in 
charge. This was Buffett’s pattern over and over as he built a con-
glomerate by adding to his company’s portfolio of businesses. He 
provided the financial backing, but he didn’t meddle in the day-
to-day management decisions of the corporations he purchased.
Berkshire Hathaway became the corporate vehicle through 
which Buffett acquired a variety of companies. In the early days, 
he pursued insurance firms, banks, and publishing companies. 
He continued buying year after year, adding See’s Candies to 
his conglomerate and, later, GEICO insurance, sticking to his 
tried-and-true formula of investing in companies with long-term 
profit potential and strong competitive positions.
Living in Omaha, Buffett couldn’t help but notice the suc-
cess of the Nebraska Furniture Mart, a superstore that annually 
sold $100 million worth of furniture. The family-owned business 
was a fierce competitor and a major regional power in furniture 
retailing. Although Buffett had tried, unsuccessfully, to buy the 
store, he never gave up. During the 1980s, he again approached 
the retailer. This time he pointed out all the financial benefits of 
being part of Berkshire Hathaway and emphasized his hands-off 
approach to ownership. Berkshire Hathaway won the deal.
Today Berkshire Hathaway has more than six dozen compa-
nies in its diverse portfolio. Although it still owns some of the 
companies it acquired decades ago, the portfolio has changed 
a bit over the years. GEICO, the third-largest U.S. auto insur-
ance firm, has been a member of the conglomerate since 1996. 
Berkshire Hathaway also owns the General Re insurance firm. 
Among the retailing businesses it owns are Jordan Furniture, 
Star Furniture, Helzberg Diamonds, and the Pampered Chef 
direct-seller of kitchen tools. In addition, it owns the ice-cream 
franchising company Dairy Queen; Benjamin Moore paint; 
Johns Manville building products; and Shaw Industries, which 
makes tufted broadloom carpeting and distributes other floor-
ing products.
Berkshire Hathaway has expanded into transportation, as 
well. Its NetJets was a pioneer in offering companies and indi-
viduals the opportunity to own a fraction of a private jet, so they

can enjoy the convenience of flying whenever and wherever they 
want. In 2010, the conglomerate paid $26 billion for Burlington 
Northern Santa Fe Corp., a railroad that serves western and 
southwestern states. This acquisition, labeled “brilliant” by a 
railway competitor because it was completed just as the industry 
began to rebound from recession, gave Buffett access to years 
of details about the size, volume, and destination of train ship-
ments. By analyzing this information, Buffett spotted clues that 
helped him fine-tune his investments.
The annual meeting held by Berkshire Hathaway is unlike any 
stockholder gathering on Earth. The more-than-35,000 people in 
attendance spend hours browsing and buying from exhibits set up 
by the conglomerate’s companies. Stockholders are encouraged 
to bring the details of their car insurance and let GEICO give them 
quotes on the spot, including a small ownership discount. Nebraska 
Furniture Mart promotes a special stockholders’ weekend of sales, 
as do other Berkshire Hathaway-owned retailers in the area. The 
annual meeting is such a high-profile event that it merits coverage 
by the New York Times, CNBC, and Fortune magazine, among many 
other major media outlets. What will Berkshire Hathaway’s next 
acquisition target be?18
Questions
1.	 Why would Berkshire Hathaway own a number of furniture

or one of the conglomerate’s companies? Explain.
1 	Social Media Exercise
Not-for-profit organizations have used social media to redefine 
how they can get funding for their missions. There are even a few 
that exist totally online. Check out www.donorschoose.org and 
www.kiva.org. Both of these depend on crowds (called crowd-
funding) to either fund educational projects (Donors Choose) or 
lend money to support projects all over the world (Kiva) using the 
microfinancing model.
a.	 Take a minute to explore these sites and view some of the 
projects up for funding. How are these projects organized? Do 
you think these models are effective? Why or why not?
b.	 Both Donors Choose and Kiva are for not-for-profits; do you 
think these models are useful for “for-profit” businesses? Why 
or why not?
2 	JOURNALING FOR SUCCESS

lege. Would you prefer to work in someone else’s business or one 
that you would start? Explain your answer.
Assuming that you have decided to start your own small busi-
ness, what type of business will you start? What special skills and 
experience will you need to be successful? (Note: You may want 
to talk with someone who owns a business before answering this 
question.)
Now describe where and how you could obtain the skills and 
experience you need to be successful.
What type of business ownership would you choose for your 
business? Record your ideas and responses to the preceding 
questions.

Suppose that you are a person who has always dreamed of 
owning a business but never had the money to open one. Since 
you were old enough to read a recipe, your mother allowed 
you to help in the kitchen. Most of all, you enjoyed baking 
and decorating cakes. You liked using your imagination to cre-
ate cakes for special occasions. By the time you were in high 
school, you were baking and decorating wedding cakes for a 
fee. Also assume that after high school you started working full 
time as an adjuster for an insurance company. Your schedule 
now allows little time for baking and decorating cakes. Finally, 
assume that you inherited $250,000 and that changes at your 
job have created undue stress in your life. What should you 
do?

to examine their agreements.
5 	RESEARCHING DIFFERENT CAREERS
Many people spend their entire lives working in jobs that they do 
not enjoy. Why is this so? Often, it is because they have taken 
the first job they were offered without giving it much thought. 
How can you avoid having this happen to you? First, you should 
determine your “personal profile” by identifying and analyzing 
your own strengths, weaknesses, things you enjoy, and things you 
dislike. Second, you should identify the types of jobs that fit your 
profile. Third, you should identify and research the companies 
that offer those jobs.
Assignment
a.	 Take two sheets of paper and draw a line down the middle of 
each sheet, forming two columns on each page. Label column 
1 “Things I Enjoy or Like to Do,” column 2 “Things I Do Not 
Like Doing,” column 3 “My Strengths,” and column 4 “My 
Weaknesses.”
b.	 Record data in each column over a period of at least one 
week. You may find it helpful to have a relative or friend give 
you input.
c.	 Summarize the data, and write a profile of yourself.
d.	 Take your profile to a career counselor at your college or to 
the public library and ask for help in identifying jobs that fit 
your profile. Your college may offer testing to assess your skills 
and personality. The Internet is another resource.
e.	 Research the companies that offer the types of jobs that fit 
your profile.
f.	 Write a report on your findings.

Part 2   Business Ownership and Entrepreneurship
Locker Lookz Looks for Higher Sales
Texas entrepreneurs Christi Sterling and JoAnn Brewer started Locker Lookz in 2008 with 
$50,000 in personal savings and an idea based on their daughters’ interest in personalizing 
their school lockers. Shopping for fun accessories before the start of school, the moth-
ers and their daughters found very little ready-made for dressing up a locker, in stores or 
online. Eventually, they bought materials at local craft stores to create wallpaper and car-
peting for the girls’ lockers. When friends started asking where they could buy these deco-
rations, “We had a light-bulb moment,” Brewer says. “There’s a real need for something 
that’s cute, easy, and one-stop shopping.”
The co-founders designed a limited line of locker decorations, all styled for middle-
school tastes, and priced at $10 and up. Next, they connected with a sales expert who spe-
cializes in distributing products through local and national retailers. With his help, Sterling 
and Brewer arranged for overseas manufacturers to produce the items, found a packager 
to ready the products for retail display, and completed a successful sales test in several 
dozen stores. Soon, JCPenney and Hallmark were placing orders, followed by Learning 
Express and other retail chains. 
By mid-2011, more than 1,200 stores were signed up to carry Locker Lookz acces-
sories for the back-to-school selling season. Now Sterling and Brewer had a few weeks to 
raise $1 million to pay for manufacturing and shipping the goods from factories in China 
to stores across the United States. Just in time, they raised cash from relatives and from 
a church investment group. The containers filled with Locker Lookz merchandise arrived 
on schedule, and soon the co-founders began crisscrossing the country to publicize their 
expanding product line. 
Today, Locker Lookz is an entrepreneurial multimillion-dollar company facing increased 
competition from other firms that see locker decor as a profitable business opportunity. 
Although the preferences of preteen girls can change rapidly and without warning, Brewer 
and Sterling are paying close attention to fashion trends and asking their daughters’ advice 
about new product ideas. How much room does Locker Lookz have to grow?1
A
s is in the case of Christie Sterling’s and JoAnn Brewer’s Locker Lookz, most 
businesses start small and those that survive usually stay small. They provide a 
solid foundation for our economy—as employers, as suppliers and purchasers 
of goods and services, and as taxpayers.
In this chapter, we do not take small businesses for granted. Instead, we look 
closely at this important business sector—beginning with a definition of small busi-
ness, a description of industries that often attract small businesses, and a profile of 
some of the people who start small businesses. Next, we consider the importance of 
small businesses in our economy. We also present the advantages and disadvantages 
of smallness in business. We then describe services provided by the Small Business 
Administration, a government agency formed to assist owners and managers of small 
businesses. We conclude the chapter with a discussion of the pros and cons of fran-
chising, an approach to small-business ownership that has become very popular in the 
last 50 years.

Lookz after their daughters

accessories to decorate their

Small Business: A Profile
The Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a small business as “one which is 
independently owned and operated for profit and is not dominant in its field.” How 
small must a firm be not to dominate its field? That depends on the particular industry 
it is in. The SBA has developed the following specific “smallness” guidelines for the 
various industries, as shown in Table 5.1.2 The SBA periodically revises and simplifies 
its small-business size regulations.
Annual sales in millions of dollars may not seem very small. However, for many 
firms, profit is only a small percentage of total sales. Thus, a firm may earn only 
$40,000 or $50,000 on yearly sales of $1 million—and that is small in comparison 
with the profits earned by most medium-sized and large firms. Moreover, most small 
firms have annual sales well below the maximum limits in the SBA guidelines.
Small businesses are very important to the U.S. economy. For example, small 
businesses
	 •	 represent 99.7 percent of all employer firms;
	 •	 employ about half of all private sector employees;
	 •	 pay 43 percent of total U.S. private payroll;
	 •	 have generated 65 percent of net new jobs over the past 17 years;
	 •	 create more than half of the nonfarm private GDP;
	 •	 hire 43 percent of high-tech workers (scientists, engineers, computer programmers, 
and others);
	 •	 are 52 percent home-based and 2 percent franchises;
	 •	 made up 97.5 percent of all identified exporters and produced 31 percent of export 
value in FY 2008; and
	 •	 produced 16.5 times more patents per employee than large patenting firms.3
The Small-Business Sector
In the United States, it typically takes less than a week and $500 to establish a business 
as a legal entity. The steps include registering the name of the business, applying for

tax IDs, and setting up unemployment and workers’ 
compensation insurance. In Japan, however, a typical 
entrepreneur spends more than $3,500 and 31 days to 
follow 11 different procedures.
A surprising number of Americans take advantage 
of their freedom to start a business. There are, in fact, 
about 27.5 million businesses in this country. Only 
just 18,469 of these employ more than 500 workers—
enough to be considered large.
Interest in owning or starting a small business has never 
been greater than it is today. During the last decade, the num-
ber of small businesses in the United States has increased 49 
percent. For the last few years, new-business formation in the 
United States has broken successive records, except during the 
2001–2002 and 2008 recessions. Recently, nearly 552,600 new 
businesses were incorporated. Furthermore, part-time entrepre-
neurs have increased fivefold in recent years; they now account 
for one-third of all small businesses.4
According to a recent study, 69 percent of new businesses 
survive at least two years, about 50 percent survive at least five 
years, and 31 percent survive at least ten years.5 The primary 
reason for these failures is mismanagement resulting from a 
lack of business know-how. The makeup of the small-business 
sector thus is constantly changing. Despite the high failure 
rate, many small businesses succeed modestly. Some, like Apple Computer, Inc., are 
extremely successful—to the point where they can no longer be considered small. 
Taken together, small businesses are also responsible for providing a high percentage 
of the jobs in the United States. According to some estimates, the figure is well over 
50 percent.
Industries That Attract Small Businesses
Some industries, such as auto manufacturing, require huge investments in machinery 
and equipment. Businesses in such industries are big from the day they are started—if 
an entrepreneur or group of entrepreneurs can gather the capital required to start one.
By contrast, a number of other industries require only a low initial investment and 
some special skills or knowledge. It is these industries that tend to attract new busi-
nesses. Growing industries, such as outpatient-care facilities, are attractive because of 
their profit potential. However, knowledgeable entrepreneurs choose areas with which 
they are familiar, and these are most often the more established industries.
Small enterprise spans the gamut from corner newspaper vending to the develop-
ment of optical fibers. The owners of small businesses sell gasoline, flowers, and coffee 
to go. They publish magazines, haul freight, teach languages, and program comput-
ers. They make wines, movies, and high-fashion clothes. They build new homes and 
restore old ones. They fix appliances, recycle metals, and sell used cars. They drive 
cabs and fly planes. They make us well when we are ill, and they sell us the products 
of corporate giants. In fact, 74 percent of real estate, rental, and leasing industries; 
61 percent of the businesses in the leisure and hospitality services; and 86 percent of 
the construction industries are dominated by small businesses. The various kinds of 
businesses generally fall into three broad categories of industry: distribution, service, 
and production.
Distribution Industries  This category includes retailing, wholesaling, transporta-
tion, and communications—industries concerned with the movement of goods from 
producers to consumers. Distribution industries account for approximately 33 percent 
of all small businesses. Of these, almost three-quarters are involved in retailing, that 
is, the sale of goods directly to consumers. Clothing and jewelry stores, pet shops, 
Personal

Sometime in your career, you’re likely to have a job in a 
small business. You might work in a store, in a service 
business, or in production. If you’re thinking of starting your 
own business, be sure to watch how these entrepreneurs 
manage their companies.

bookstores, and grocery stores, for example, are all retailing firms. Slightly less than 
one-quarter of the small distribution firms are wholesalers. Wholesalers purchase prod-
ucts in quantity from manufacturers and then resell them to retailers.
Service Industries  This category accounts for more than 48 percent of all small 
businesses. Of these, about three-quarters provide such nonfinancial services as medi-
cal and dental care; watch, shoe, and TV repairs; haircutting and styling; restaurant 
meals; and dry cleaning. About 8 percent of the small service firms offer financial ser-
vices, such as accounting, insurance, real estate, and investment counseling. An increas-
ing number of self-employed Americans are running service businesses from home.
Production Industries  This last category includes the construction, mining, and 
manufacturing industries. Only about 19 percent of all small businesses are in this 
group, mainly because these industries require relatively large initial investments. Small 
firms that do venture into production generally make parts and subassemblies for 
larger manufacturing firms or supply special skills to larger construction firms.
The People in Small Businesses: The 
Entrepreneurs
The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in the United States. One study 
revealed that the U.S. population is quite entrepreneurial when compared 
with those of other countries. More than 70 percent of Americans would 
prefer being an entrepreneur to working for someone else. This compares with 
46 percent of adults in Western Europe and 58 percent of adults in Canada. 
Another study on entrepreneurial activity for 2002 found that of 36 countries 
studied, the United States was in the top third in entrepreneurial activity and 
was the leader when compared with Japan, Canada, and Western Europe.6
Small businesses typically are managed by the people who started and own 
them. Most of these people have held jobs with other firms and still could be 
so employed if they wanted. Yet owners of small businesses would rather take 
the risk of starting and operating their own firms, even if the money they make 
is less than the salaries they otherwise might earn.
Researchers have suggested a variety of personal factors as reasons why 
people go into business for themselves. These are discussed next.
Characteristics of Entrepreneurs
Entrepreneurial spirit is the desire to create a new business. For example, Nikki 
Olyai always knew that she wanted to create and develop her own business. 
Her father, a successful businessman in Iran, was her role model. She came 
to the United States at the age of 17 and lived with a host family in Salem, 
Oregon, attending high school there. Undergraduate and graduate degrees 
in computer science led her to start Innovision Technologies while she held 
two other jobs to keep the business going and took care of her four-year-old 
son. Recently, Nikki Olyai’s business was honored by the Women’s Business 
Enterprise National Council’s “Salute to Women’s Business Enterprises” as one 
of 11 top successful firms. For three consecutive years, her firm was selected as 
a “Future 50 of Greater Detroit Company.”
Other Personal Factors
Other personal factors in small-business success include
	•  independence;
	•  a desire to determine one’s own destiny;

Part 2   Business Ownership and Entrepreneurship
	 •	 a willingness to find and accept a challenge;
	 •	 family background (in particular, researchers think that people whose families 
have been in business, successfully or not, are most apt to start and run their own 
businesses); and
	 •	 age (those who start their own businesses also tend to cluster around certain 
ages—more than 70 percent are between 24 and 44 years of age; see Figure 5.1).
Motivation
There must be some motivation to start a business. A person may decide that he or she 
simply has “had enough” of working and earning a profit for someone else. Another may 
lose his or her job for some reason and decide to start the business he or she has always 
wanted rather than to seek another job. Still another person may have an idea for a new 
product or a new way to sell an existing product. Or the opportunity to go into business 
may arise suddenly, perhaps as a result of a hobby. For example, Cheryl Strand started 
baking and decorating cakes from her home while working full time as a word processor 
at Clemson University. Her cakes became so popular that she soon found herself working 
through her lunch breaks and late into the night to meet customer demand.
Women as Small-Business Owners
According to the latest 2012 data available from the Small Business Administration:
●
●Women are 51 percent of the U.S. population, and according to the SBA, they 
owned at least 50 percent of all small businesses in 2008.
●
●Women already own 66 percent of the home-based businesses in this country, and 
the number of men in home-based businesses is growing rapidly.
●
●About 7.8 million women-owned businesses in the United States provide almost 
7.6 million jobs and generate $1.2 trillion in sales.
●
●Women-owned businesses in the United States have proven that they are more suc-
cessful; more than 40 percent have been in business for 12 years or more.
●
●Women-owned businesses are financially sound and credit-worthy, and their risk 
of failure is lower than average.
●
●Compared to other working women, self-employed women are older, better edu-
cated, and have more managerial experience.
●
●Just over one-half of small businesses are home based, and 91 percent have no employ-
ees. About 60 percent of home-based businesses are in service industries, 16 percent 
in construction, 14 percent in retail trade, and the rest in manufacturing, finance, 
transportation, communications, wholesaling, and other industries.7
People in all age groups become entrepreneurs, but more than  
70 percent are between 24 and 44 years of age.

Teenagers as Small-Business Owners
High-tech teen entrepreneurship is definitely exploding. “There’s not a period in history 
where we’ve seen such a plethora of young entrepreneurs,” comments Nancy F. Koehn, 
associate professor of business administration at Harvard Business School. Still, teen 
entrepreneurs face unique pressures in juggling their schoolwork, their social life, and 
their high-tech workload. Some ultimately quit school, whereas others quit or cut back 
on their business activities. Consider Brian Hendricks at Winston Churchill High School 
in Potomac, Maryland. He is the founder of StartUpPc and VB Solutions, Inc. StartUpPc, 
founded in 2001, sells custom-built computers and computer services for home users, 
home offices, small businesses, and students. Brian’s services include design, installation 
of systems, training, networking, and on-site technical support. In October 2002, Brian 
founded VB Solutions, Inc., which develops and customizes Web 
sites and message boards. The firm sets up advertising contracts and 
counsels Web site owners on site improvements. The company has 
designed corporate ID kits, logos, and Web sites for clients from 
all over the world. Brian learned at a very young age that working 
for yourself is one of the best jobs available. According to Brian, a 
young entrepreneur must possess “the five P’s of entrepreneurship”—
planning, persistence, patience, people, and profit. Brian knows what 
it takes to be a successful entrepreneur. His accolades include Junior 
Achievement’s “National Youth Entrepreneur of the Year” and SBA’s 
2005 “Young Entrepreneur of the Year” awards.8
In some people, the motivation to start a business develops 
slowly as they gain the knowledge and ability required for success 
as a business owner. Knowledge and ­ability—especially, manage-
ment ability—are probably the most important factors involved. A 
new firm is very much built around the entrepreneur. The owner 
must be able to manage the firm’s finances, its personnel (if there 
are any employees), and its day-to-day operations. He or she must 
handle sales, advertising, purchasing, pricing, and a variety of other 
business functions. The knowledge and ability to do so are acquired 
most often through experience working for other firms in the same 
area of business.
Mary Rodas, a child entrepreneur. At age 13, Mary 
scored an instant success with the ‘Balzac,’ a ball 
made by blowing up a balloon inside a fabric sack, 
jazzed up with vivid colors and designs. At Catco, Inc., 
she became vice president of marketing at age 14, 
earning $200,000 a year. Balzac Balloon Ball sales have 
exceeded $100 million per year.

Career
SUCCESS
Is Entrepreneurship in Your Future?
Some entrepreneurs realize early that they 
want to start a business. Others become 
entrepreneurs after working for other people. 
You can take a number of tests to assess whether 
you have the drive, temperament, and attitude to be your own 
boss. No test can tell whether your business will be successful, 
but you can get a sense of your own skills and capabilities as a 
future entrepreneur.
Stop by the career center on campus, which may offer an 
entrepreneurship self-test. For another perspective on your 
entrepreneurial potential, take at least one more test. For 
example, the informal questions on the Isenberg Entrepreneur 
Test, created by Professor Daniel Isenberg of Babson College, 
are designed to get you thinking about what you like and why. 
Do you like to challenge yourself? Would you prefer to fail at 
something you’ve chosen rather than succeed at something 
chosen by someone else?
The U.S. Small Business Administration (www.sba.gov) 
offers an online self-assessment to determine whether you’re 
ready to start your own business. In addition, compare what 
you know about yourself to the SBA’s listing of entrepreneur 
characteristics to see how well you match up. Similarly, the 
Business Development Bank of Canada’s online test shows 
whether your attitudes, aptitudes, and motivations would be 
a good fit with the entrepreneurial life.

Part 2   Business Ownership and Entrepreneurship
Why Some Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses Fail
Small businesses are prone to failure. Capital, management, and planning are the key 
ingredients in the survival of a small business, as well as the most common reasons for 
failure. Businesses can experience a number of money-related problems. It may take 
several years before a business begins to show a profit. Entrepreneurs need to have not 
only the capital to open a business but also the money to operate it in its possibly lengthy 
start-up phase. One cash flow obstacle often leads to others. Moreover, a series of cash 
flow predicaments usually ends in a business failure. This scenario is played out all too 
often by small and not-so-small start-up Internet firms that fail to meet their financial 
backers’ expectations and so are denied a second wave of investment dollars to continue 
their drive to establish a profitable online firm. According to Maureen Borzacchiello, 
co-owner of Creative Display Solutions, a trade show products company, “Big businesses 
such as Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and AIG can get bailouts, but small-
business owners are on their own when times are tough and credit is tight.”
Many entrepreneurs lack the management skills required to run a business. Money, 
time, personnel, and inventory all need to be managed effectively if a small business is 
to succeed. Starting a small business requires much more than optimism and a good 
idea.
Success and expansion sometimes lead to problems. Frequently, entrepreneurs with 
successful small businesses make the mistake of overexpansion. Fast growth often 
results in dramatic changes in a business. Thus, the entrepreneur must plan carefully 
and adjust competently to new and potentially disruptive situations.
Every day, and in every part of the country, people open new businesses. For 
example, 552,600 new businesses recently opened their doors. At the same time, how-
ever, 660,900 businesses closed their business and 60,837 businesses (in 2009) declared 
bankruptcy (see Table 5.2).9 Although many fail, others represent well-conceived ideas 
developed by entrepreneurs who have the expertise, resources, and determination to 
make their businesses succeed. As these well-prepared entrepreneurs pursue their indi-
vidual goals, our society benefits in many ways from their work and creativity. Billion-
dollar companies such as Apple Computer, McDonald’s Corporation, and Procter & 
Gamble are all examples of small businesses that expanded into industry giants.
The Importance of Small Businesses 
in Our Economy
This country’s economic history abounds with stories of ambitious men and women who 
turned their ideas into business dynasties. The Ford Motor Company started as a one-
man operation with an innovative method for industrial production. L.L.Bean, Inc., can

trace its beginnings to a basement shop in Freeport, Maine. Both Xerox and Polaroid 
began as small firms with a better way to do a job. Indeed, every year since 1963, 
the President of the United States has proclaimed National Small Business Week to 
recognize the contributions of small businesses to the economic well-being of America.
Providing Technical Innovation
Invention and innovation are part of the foundations of our economy. The increases in 
productivity that have characterized the past 200 years of our history are all rooted in 
one principal source: new ways to do a job with less effort for less money. Studies show 
that the incidence of innovation among small-business workers is significantly higher 
than among workers in large businesses. Small firms produce two-and-a-half times as 
many innovations as large firms relative to the number of persons employed. In fact, 
small firms employ 40 percent of all high-tech workers such as scientists, engineers, 
and computer specialists. No wonder small firms produce 13 to 14 times more patents 
per employee than large patenting firms.
Consider Waymon Armstrong, the owner of a small business that uses computer 
simulations to help government and other clients prepare for and respond to natural 
disasters, medical emergencies, and combat. In presenting the 2010 National Small 
Business Person of the Year award, Karen Mills, Administrator of the U.S. Small 
Business Administration, said, “Waymon Armstrong is a perfect example of the inno-
vation, inspiration, and determination that exemplify America’s most successful entre-
preneurs. He believed in his brainchild to the point where he deferred his own salary 
for three years to keep it afloat. When layoffs loomed for his staff after 9/11, their 
loyalty and belief in the company was so great that they were willing to work without 
pay for four months.
“Waymon’s commitment to his employees and to his business—Engineering & 
Computer Simulations, Inc.—demonstrates the qualities that make small businesses 
such a powerful force for job creation in the American economy and in their local 
communities,” said Mills. “It’s the same qualities that will lead us to economic recovery. 
We are especially proud that his company benefited from two grants under SBA’s Small 
Business Innovation and Research Program.”10
According to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, more than half the major 
technological advances of the 20th century originated with individual inventors and 
small companies. Even just a sampling of those innovations is remarkable:
●
●Air conditioning
●
●Airplane
●
●Automatic transmission
●
●FM radio
●
●Heart valve
●
●Helicopter
●
●Instant camera
●
●Insulin
●
●Jet engine
●
●Penicillin
●
●Personal computer
●
●Power steering
Perhaps even more remarkable—and important—is that many of these inventions 
sparked major new U.S. industries or contributed to an established industry by adding 
some valuable service.
Providing Employment
Small firms traditionally have added more than their proportional share of new jobs 
to the economy. Seven out of the ten industries that added the most new jobs were 
small-business-dominated industries. Small businesses creating the most new jobs 
recently included business services, leisure and hospitality services, and special trade

Part 2   Business Ownership and Entrepreneurship
contractors. Small firms hire a larger proportion of 
employees who are younger workers, older workers, 
women, or workers who prefer to work part time.
Furthermore, small businesses provide 67 percent 
of workers with their first jobs and initial on-the-job 
training in basic skills. According to the SBA, small 
businesses represent 99.7 percent of all employers, 
employ more than 50 percent of the private workforce, 
and provide about two-thirds of the net new jobs added 
to our economy.11 Small businesses thus contribute sig-
nificantly to solving unemployment problems.
The business cycle, as discussed in Chapter 1, is an impor-
tant factor in the net creation or loss of jobs. During the 2008–
2009 recession, businesses with fewer than 20 employees began 
losing jobs as early as mid-2007. From 2008 to mid-2009, these 
smallest businesses accounted for 24 percent of the net job 
losses, while those with 20–499 employees accounted for 36 
percent; the remaining 40 percent of job losses were in larger 
firms with more than 500 employees.12
Providing Competition
Small businesses challenge larger, established firms in many 
ways, causing them to become more efficient and more 
responsive to consumer needs. A small business cannot, of 
course, compete with a large firm in all respects. However, a 
number of small firms, each competing in its own particular 
area and its own particular way, together have the desired 
competitive effect. Thus, several small janitorial companies 
together add up to reasonable competition for the no-longer-
small ServiceMaster.
Filling Needs of Society and Other Businesses
Small firms also provide a variety of goods and services to each other and to much 
larger firms. Sears, Roebuck & Co. purchases merchandise from approximately 12,000 
suppliers—and most of them are small businesses. General Motors relies on more 
than 32,000 companies for parts and supplies and depends on more than 11,000 
independent dealers to sell its automobiles and trucks. Large firms generally buy parts 
and assemblies from smaller firms for one very good reason: It is less expensive than 
manufacturing the parts in their own factories. This lower cost eventually is reflected 
in the price that consumers pay for their products.
It is clear that small businesses are a vital part of our economy and that, as 
consumers and as members of the labor force, we all benefit enormously from their 
existence. Now let us look at the situation from the viewpoint of the owners of small 
businesses.
The Pros and Cons of Smallness
Do most owners of small businesses dream that their firms will grow into giant 
corporations—managed by professionals—while they serve only on the board of 
directors? Or would they rather stay small, in a firm where they have the opportunity 
(and the responsibility) to do everything that needs to be done? The answers depend 
on the personal characteristics and motivations of the individual owners. For many, the 
advantages of remaining small far outweigh the disadvantages.

Advantages of Small Business
Small-business owners with limited resources often must struggle 
to enter competitive new markets. They also have to deal with 
increasing international competition. However, they enjoy several 
unique advantages.
Personal Relationships with Customers and Employees 
For those who like dealing with people, small business is the place 
to be. The owners of retail shops get to know many of their custom-
ers by name and deal with them on a personal basis. Through such 
relationships, small-business owners often become involved in the 
social, cultural, and political life of the community.
Relationships between owner-managers and employees also 
tend to be closer in smaller businesses. In many cases, the owner is 
a friend and counselor as well as the boss.
These personal relationships provide an important business 
advantage. The personal service small businesses offer to customers 
is a major competitive weapon—one that larger firms try to match 
but often cannot. In addition, close relationships with employees 
often help the small-business owner to keep effective workers who might earn more 
with a larger firm.
Ability to Adapt to Change  Being his or her own boss, the owner-manager of a 
small business does not need anyone’s permission to adapt to change. An owner may add 
or discontinue merchandise or services, change store hours, and experiment with vari-
ous price strategies in response to changes in market conditions. And through personal 
relationships with customers, the owners of small businesses quickly become aware of 
changes in people’s needs and interests, as well as in the activities of competing firms.
Simplified Record Keeping  Many small firms need only a simple set of records. 
Record keeping might consist of a checkbook, a cash-receipts journal in which to 
record all sales, and a cash-disbursements journal in which to record all amounts paid 
out. Obviously, enough records must be kept to allow for producing and filing accurate 
tax returns.
Independence  Small-business owners do not have to punch in and out, bid for vaca-
tion times, take orders from superiors, or worry about being fired or laid off. They 
are the masters of their own destinies—at least with regard to employment. For many 
people, this is the prime advantage of owning a small business.
Other Advantages  According to the SBA, the most profitable companies in the 
United States are small firms that have been in business for more than ten years and 
employ fewer than 20 people. Small-business owners also enjoy all the advantages of 
sole proprietorships, which were discussed in Chapter 4. These include being able to 
keep all profits, the ease and low cost of going into business and (if necessary) going 
out of business, and being able to keep business information secret.
Disadvantages of Small Business
Personal contacts with customers, closer relationships with employees, being one’s own 
boss, less cumbersome record-keeping chores, and independence are the bright side of 
small business. In contrast, the dark side reflects problems unique to these firms.
Risk of Failure  As we have noted, small businesses (especially new ones) run a 
heavy risk of going out of business—about 50 percent survive at least five years.

Older, well-established small firms can be hit hard by a business recession mainly 
because they do not have the financial resources to weather an extended difficult 
period.
Limited Potential  Small businesses that survive do so with varying degrees of suc-
cess. Many are simply the means of making a living for the owner and his or her family. 
The owner may have some technical skill—as a hair stylist or electrician, for example—
and may have started a business to put this skill to work. Such a business is unlikely 
to grow into big business. In addition, employees’ potential for advancement is limited.
Limited Ability to Raise Capital  Small businesses typically have a limited abil-
ity to obtain capital. Figure 5.2 shows that most small-business financing comes 
out of the owner’s pocket. Personal loans from lending institutions provide only 
about one-fourth of the capital required by small businesses. About 50 percent of 
all new firms begin with less than $30,000 in total capital, according to Census 
Bureau and Federal Reserve surveys. In fact, almost 36 percent of new firms begin 
with less than $20,000, usually provided by the owner or family members and 
friends.13
Although every person who considers starting a small business should be aware 
of the hazards and pitfalls we have noted, a well-conceived business plan may help to 
avoid the risk of failure. The U.S. government is also dedicated to helping small busi-
nesses make it. It expresses this aim most actively through the SBA.
The Importance of a Business Plan
Lack of planning can be as deadly as lack of money to a new small business. Planning 
is important to any business, large or small, and never should be overlooked or taken 
lightly. A business plan is a carefully constructed guide for the person starting a 
business. Consider it as a tool with three basic purposes: communication, management, 
Small businesses get financing from various sources; the most  
important is personal savings.

Success
A growing number of students are becoming 
entrepreneurs even before they graduate, 
gaining valuable business experience and 
taking advantage of the many resources on campus. 
Brandt Page, who started a company while at Brigham Young 
University and has since founded or co-founded two more, 
explains that as a student entrepreneur, “you have free access 
to libraries, free access to mentors, to professors, to business 
competitions, to really being recognized and mentored.”
Corinne Prevot had already earned $8,000 from her 
ski apparel business, Skida, before she entered college. 
After taking an entrepreneurship course as a freshman at 
Middlebury College, she rethought her approach to business. 
She researched competitors, looked at distribution, repriced 
her products, and formalized her branding. Now Skida’s 
yearly sales are more than $100,000, and Prevot is ready to 
expand.
Partners Noah Chilton, Harry Kelley, Jackson Kroopf, and 
Misha Epstein like gourmet coffee, so they created a rolling 
cart to bring their favorite brews to classmates at Vassar 
through a business they called Tree City. The entrepreneurs 
buy from growers who use eco-friendly agricultural methods 
and they discuss good coffee while they brew a fresh cup for 
each customer. “Part of what we love about coffee is the way it 
brings people together,” Kroopf says.

and planning. As a communication tool, a business plan 
serves as a concise document that potential investors 
can examine to see if they would like to invest or assist 
in financing a new venture. It shows whether a business 
has the potential to make a profit. As a management 
tool, the business plan helps to track, monitor, and 
evaluate the progress. The business plan is a living 
document; it is modified as the entrepreneur gains 
knowledge and experience. It also serves to establish 
time lines and milestones and allows comparison of 
growth projections against actual accomplishments. Finally, 
as a planning tool, the business plan guides a businessperson 
through the various phases of business. For example, the plan 
helps to identify obstacles to avoid and to establish alternatives. 
According to Robert Krummer, Jr., chairman of First Business 
Bank in Los Angeles, “The business plan is a necessity. If the 
person who wants to start a small business can’t put a business 
plan together, he or she is in trouble.”
Components of a Business Plan
Table 5.3 shows the 12 sections that a business plan should 
include. Each section is further explained at the end of each 
of the seven major parts in the text. The goal of each end-
of-the-part exercise is to help a businessperson create his or 
her own business plan. When constructing a business plan, the 
businessperson should strive to keep it easy to read, uncluttered, and complete. Like 
other busy executives, officials of financial institutions do not have the time to wade 
through pages of extraneous data. The business plan should answer the four questions 
banking officials and investors are most interested in: (1) What exactly is the nature

Although writing a business plan won’t guarantee your 
success, it will help you think through many of the issues 
that can trip up entrepreneurs. And if you work for a big 
company, you may find yourself writing a kind of business 
plan for a product or project.

and mission of the new venture? (2) Why is this new enterprise a good idea? (3) What 
are the businessperson’s goals? (4) How much will the new venture cost?
The great amount of time and consideration that should go into creating a business 
plan probably will end up saving time later. For example, Sharon Burch, who was run-
ning a computer software business while earning a degree in business administration, 
had to write a business plan as part of one of her courses. Burch has said, “I wish I’d 
taken the class before I started my business. I see a lot of things I could have done dif-
ferently. But it has helped me since because I’ve been using the business plan as a guide 
for my business.” Table 5.4 provides a business plan checklist. Accuracy and realistic 
expectations are crucial to an effective business plan. It is unethical to deceive loan 
officers, and it is unwise to deceive yourself.

The Small Business Administration
The Small Business Administration (SBA), created by Congress in 1953, is a 
governmental agency that assists, counsels, and protects the interests of small businesses 
in the United States. It helps people get into business and stay in business. The agency 
provides assistance to owners and managers of prospective, new, and established 
small businesses. Through more than 1,000 offices and resource centers throughout 
the nation, the SBA provides both financial assistance and management counseling. 
Recently, the SBA provided training, technical assistance, and education to more than 
3 million small businesses. It helps small firms to bid for and obtain government 
contracts, and it helps them to prepare to enter foreign markets.
SBA Management Assistance
Statistics show that most failures in small business are related to poor management. 
For this reason, the SBA places special emphasis on improving the management ability 
of the owners and managers of small businesses. The SBA’s Management Assistance 
Program is extensive and diversified. It includes free individual counseling, courses, 
conferences, workshops, and a wide range of publications. Recently, the SBA provided 
management and technical assistance to nearly 1 million small businesses through its

Management Courses and Workshops  The management courses offered by the 
SBA cover all the functions, duties, and roles of managers. Instructors may be teachers 
from local colleges and universities or other professionals, such as management con-
sultants, bankers, lawyers, and accountants. Fees for these courses are quite low. The 
most popular such course is a general survey of eight to ten different areas of business 
management. In follow-up studies, businesspeople may concentrate in depth on one 
or more of these areas depending on their particular strengths and weaknesses. The 
SBA occasionally offers one-day conferences. These conferences are aimed at keeping 
owner-managers up-to-date on new management developments, tax laws, and the like. 
The Small Business Training Network (SBTN) is an online training network consisting 
of 83 SBA-run courses, workshops, and resources. Some of the most requested courses 
include Entrepreneurship, Starting and Managing Your Own Business, Developing 
a Business Plan, Managing the Digital Enterprise, Identify Your Target Market, and 
Analyze Profitability. Find out more at www.sba.gov/training. Recently, more than 
240,000 small-business owners benefited from SBA’s free online business courses.
SCORE  The Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE), created in 1964, is 
a group of more than 13,000 retired and active businesspeople including more than 
2,000 women who volunteer their services to small businesses through the SBA. The 
collective experience of SCORE volunteers spans the full range of American enterprise. 
These volunteers have worked for such notable companies as Eastman Kodak, General 
Electric, IBM, and Procter & Gamble. Experts in areas of accounting, finance, market-
ing, engineering, and retailing provide counseling and mentoring to entrepreneurs.
A small-business owner who has a particular problem can request free counseling from 
SCORE. An assigned counselor visits the owner in his or her establishment and, through 
careful observation, analyzes the business situation and the problem. If the problem is 
complex, the counselor may call on other volunteer experts to assist. Finally, the counselor 
offers a plan for solving the problem and helping the owner through the critical period.
Consider the plight of Elizabeth Halvorsen, a mystery writer from Minneapolis. 
Her husband had built up the family advertising and graphic arts firm for 17 years 
when he was called in 1991 to serve in the Persian Gulf War. The only one left behind 
to run the business was Mrs. Halvorsen, who admittedly had no 
business experience. Enter SCORE. With a SCORE management 
expert at her side, she kept the business on track. Recently, SCORE 
volunteers served more than 523,800 small-business people like 
Mrs. Halvorsen through its 389 offices. The 13,000 counselors 
provided 203,000 face-to-face counseling sessions, 119,000 online 
counseling sessions, and more than 49,500 online workshops to 
more than 201,000 workshop participants. Since its inception, 
SCORE has assisted more than 9 million small-business people 
with online and face-to-face small business counseling.15
Help for Minority-Owned Small Businesses
Americans who are members of minority groups have had 
difficulty entering the nation’s economic mainstream. Raising 
money is a nagging problem for minority business owners, who 
also may lack adequate training. Members of minority groups 
are, of course, eligible for all SBA programs, but the SBA makes 
a special effort to assist those minority groups who want to 
start small businesses or expand existing ones. For example, the 
Minority Business Development Agency awards grants to develop 
and increase business opportunities for members of racial and 
ethnic minorities.
Banking on the Banks. Meet Marilyn and Dwayne 
Banks, owners of Marilyn’s Gift Gallery and Sound 
World Music, in their East Waco, TX, gift shop. Since 
opening their business in 1989, they have helped start 
many community projects including an association to 
help minority business owners in the area.

Helping women become entrepreneurs is also a special goal of the SBA. Emily 
Harrington, one of nine children, was born in Manila, the Philippines. She arrived in 
the United States in 1972 as a foreign-exchange student. Convinced that there was a 
market for hard-working, dedicated minorities and women, she launched Qualified 
Resources, Inc., a professional staffing services firm. Inc. magazine selected her firm as 
one of “America’s Fastest Growing Private Companies” just six years later. Harrington 
credits the SBA with giving her the technical support that made her first loan possible. 
Finding a SCORE counselor to work directly with her, she refined her business plan 
until she got a bank loan. Before contacting the SBA, Harrington was turned down for 
business loans “by all the banks I approached,” even though she worked as a manager 
of loan credit and collection for a bank. Later, Emily Harrington was SBA’s winner 
of the local, regional, and national Small Business Entrepreneurial Success Award for 
Rhode Island, the New England region, and the nation! For several years in a row, 
Qualified Resources, Inc., was named one of the fastest growing private companies 
in Rhode Island. Now with more than 100 Women’s Business Centers, entrepreneurs 
like Harrington can receive training and technical assistance, access to credit and capi-
tal, federal contracts, and international markets. The SBA’s Online Women’s Business 
Center (www.sba.gov/aboutsba/sbaprograms/onlinewbc/index.html) is a state-of-the-art 
Internet site to help women expand their businesses. This free, interactive Web site offers 
women information about business principles and practices, management techniques, 
networking, industry news, market research and technology training, online counseling, 
and hundreds of links to other sites, as well as information about the many SBA services 
and resources available to them.
Small-Business Institutes  Small-business institutes (SBIs), created in 1972, 
are groups of senior and graduate students in business administration who provide 
management counseling to small businesses. SBIs have been set up on more than 
520 college campuses as another way to help business owners. The students work in 
small groups guided by faculty advisers and SBA management-assistance experts. Like 
SCORE volunteers, they analyze and help solve the problems of small-business owners 
at their business establishments.
Small-Business Development Centers  Small-business development centers 
(SBDCs) are university-based groups that provide individual counseling and practi-
cal training to owners of small businesses. SBDCs draw from the resources of local, 
state, and federal governments, private businesses, and universities. These groups can 
provide managerial and technical help, data from research studies, and other types 
of specialized assistance of value to small businesses. In 2011, there were more than 
1,000 SBDC locations, primarily at colleges and universities, assisting people such 
as Kathleen DuBois. After scribbling a list of her abilities and the names of potential 
clients on a napkin in a local restaurant, Kathleen DuBois decided to start her own 
marketing firm. Beth Thornton launched her engineering firm after a discussion with 
a colleague in the ladies room of the Marriott. When Richard Shell was laid off after 
20 years of service with Nisource (Columbia Gas), he searched the Internet tirelessly 
before finding the right franchise option. Introduced by mutual friends, Jim Bostic 
and Denver McMillion quickly connected, built a high level of trust, and combined 
their diverse professional backgrounds to form a manufacturing company. Although 
these entrepreneurs took different routes in starting their new businesses in West 
Virginia, all of them turned to the West Virginia Small Business Development Center 
for the technical assistance to make their dreams become a reality.
SBA Publications  The SBA issues management, marketing, and technical pub-
lications dealing with hundreds of topics of interest to present and prospective 
managers of small firms. Most of these publications are available from the SBA 
free of charge. Others can be obtained for a small fee from the U.S. Government 
Printing Office.

SBA Financial Assistance
Small businesses seem to be constantly in need of money. An owner may have enough 
capital to start and operate the business. But then he or she may require more money to 
finance increased operations during peak selling seasons, to pay for required pollution 
control equipment, to finance an expansion, or to mop up after a natural disaster 
such as a flood or a terrorist attack. For example, the Supplemental Terrorist Activity 
Relief program has made $3.7 billion in loans to 8,202 small businesses harmed or 
disrupted by the September 11 terrorist attacks. In October 2005, the SBA guaranteed 
loans of up to $150,000 to small businesses affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. 
Since the 2005 hurricanes, SBA has made more than $4.9 billion in disaster loans to 
102,903 homeowners and renters in the Gulf region. Businesses in the area received 
16,828 business disaster loans with disbursements worth $1.5 billion.16 In 2010, the 
SBA offered economic injury loans to fishing and fishing-dependent small businesses as 
a result of the Deepwater BP spill that shut down commercial and recreational fishing 
waters. According to the SBA Administrator Karen Mills, “SBA remains committed to 
taking every step to help small businesses deal with the financial challenges they are 
facing as a result of the Deepwater BP oil spill.”17 The SBA offers special financial-
assistance programs that cover all these situations. However, its primary financial 
function is to guarantee loans to eligible businesses.
Regular Business Loans  Most of the SBA’s business loans are actually made by 
private lenders such as banks, but repayment is partially guaranteed by the agency. 
That is, the SBA may guarantee that it will repay the lender up to 90 percent of the 
loan if the borrowing firm cannot repay it. Guaranteed loans approved on or after 
October 1, 2002, may be as large as $1.5 million (this loan limit may be increased in 
the future). The average size of an SBA-guaranteed business loan is about $300,000, 
and its average duration is about eight years.
Small-Business Investment Companies  Venture capital is money that is 
invested in small (and sometimes struggling) firms that have the potential to become 
very successful. In many cases, only a lack of capital keeps these firms from rapid and 
solid growth. The people who invest in such firms expect that their investments will 
grow with the firms and become quite profitable.
The popularity of these investments has increased over the past 30 years, but most 
small firms still have difficulty obtaining venture capital. To help such businesses, the 
SBA licenses, regulates, and provides financial assistance to small-business invest-
ment companies (SBICs).
An SBIC is a privately owned firm that provides venture capital to small enterprises 
that meet its investment standards. Such firms as America Online, Apple Computer, 
Federal Express, Compaq Computer, Intel Corporation, Outback Steakhouse, and 
Staples, Inc., all were financed through SBICs during their initial growth period. SBICs 
are intended to be profit-making organizations. The aid that SBA offers allows them 
to invest in small businesses that otherwise would not attract venture capital. Since 
Congress created the program in 1958, SBICs have financed more than 107,000 small 
businesses for a total of about $60 billion. Recently, SBIC benefited 1,477 businesses, 
and 24 percent of these firms were less than two years old.18
State of Small Business During the Recession
Celebrating the 47th annual observance of National Small Business Week in May 
2010, President Obama stated,
Our nation is still emerging from one of the worst recessions in our history, and 
small businesses were among the hardest hit. From mom-and-pop stores to high 
tech start-ups, countless small businesses have been forced to lay off employees or 
shut their doors entirely. In these difficult times, we must do all we can to help 
these firms recover from the recession and put Americans back to work. Our

government cannot guarantee a company’s success, but it can help create market 
conditions that allow small businesses to thrive.
My Administration is committed to helping small businesses drive our 
economy toward recovery and long-term growth. The American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act has supported billions of dollars in loans and Federal contracts 
for small businesses across the country. The Affordable Care Act makes it easier 
for small business owners to provide health insurance to their employees, and gives 
entrepreneurs the security they need to innovate and take risks. We have enacted 
new tax cuts and tax credits for small firms. Still, we must do more to empower 
these companies. Small businesses are the engine of our prosperity and a proud 
reflection of our character. A healthy small business sector will give us vibrant com-
munities, cutting-edge technology, and an American economy that can compete 
and win in the 21st century.19
As if the recession was not enough, in the states near the Gulf of Mexico, many 
small businesses suffered financial losses following the April 20, 2010, Deepwater 
Horizon BP oil spill that shut down commercial and recreational fishing along the 
coasts. According to the SBA Administrator Karen Mills, “With the region still recov-
ering from previous devastation and the national recession of the last couple of years, 
it’s critical that we take every step we can to provide small businesses with resources 
to make it through this latest crisis so that they can continue to drive local economic 
growth and provide good-paying jobs.” The SBA offered working capital loans up to 
$2 million at an interest rate of 4 percent with terms up to 30 years.20
We have discussed the importance of the small-business segment of our economy. 
We have weighed the advantages and drawbacks of operating a small business as com-
pared with a large one. But is there a way to achieve the best of both worlds? Can one 
preserve one’s independence as a business owner and still enjoy some of the benefits of 
“bigness”? Let’s take a close look at franchising.
Franchising
A franchise is a license to operate an individually owned business as if it were part of a 
chain of outlets or stores. Often, the business itself is also called a franchise. Among the 
most familiar franchises are McDonald’s, H&R Block, AAMCO Transmissions, GNC 
(General Nutrition Centers), and Dairy Queen. Many other franchises carry familiar 
names; this method of doing business has become very popular in the last 30 years or 
so. It is an attractive means of starting and operating a small business.
What Is Franchising?
Franchising is the actual granting of a franchise. A franchisor is an individual or 
organization granting a franchise. A franchisee is a person or organization purchasing a 
franchise. The franchisor supplies a known and advertised business name, management 
skills, the required training and materials, and a method of doing business. The 
franchisee supplies labor and capital, operates the franchised business, and agrees to 
abide by the provisions of the franchise agreement. Table 5.5 lists the basic franchisee 
rights and obligations that would be covered in a typical franchise agreement.
Types of Franchising
Franchising arrangements fall into three general categories. In the first approach, a 
manufacturer authorizes a number of retail stores to sell a certain brand-name item. 
This type of franchising arrangement, one of the oldest, is prevalent in sales of passenger 
cars and trucks, farm equipment, shoes, paint, earth-moving equipment, and petroleum. 
About 90 percent of all gasoline is sold through franchised, independent retail service 
stations, and franchised dealers handle virtually all sales of new cars and trucks. In 
the second type of franchising arrangement, a producer licenses distributors to sell a

given product to retailers. This arrangement is common in the soft drink industry. Most 
national manufacturers of soft drink syrups—The Coca-Cola Company, Dr. Pepper/
Seven-Up Companies, PepsiCo, Royal Crown Companies, Inc.—franchise independent 
bottlers who then serve retailers. In a third form of franchising, a franchisor supplies 
brand names, techniques, or other services instead of a complete product. Although 
the franchisor may provide certain production and distribution services, its primary 
role is the careful development and control of marketing strategies. This approach 
to franchising, which is the most typical today, is used by Holiday Inns, Howard 
Johnson Company, AAMCO Transmissions, McDonald’s, Dairy Queen, Avis, Hertz 
Corporation, KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken), and SUBWAY, to name but a few.

accordance with the franchisor’s methods and subject to the franchisor’s directions;
7.  guidelines established by the franchisor regarding exclusive territorial rights; and
8.  rights to obtain supplies from nominated suppliers at special prices.

The Growth of Franchising
Franchising, which began in the United States around the time of the Civil War, was 
used originally by large firms, such as the Singer Sewing Company, to distribute 
their products. Franchising has been increasing steadily in popularity since the early 
1900s, primarily for filling stations and car dealerships; however, this retailing strategy 
has experienced enormous growth since the mid-1970s. The franchise proliferation 
generally has paralleled the expansion of the fast-food industry.
Of course, franchising is not limited to fast foods. Hair salons, tanning parlors, and 
dentists and lawyers are expected to participate in franchising arrangements in growing 
numbers. Franchised health clubs, pest exterminators, and campgrounds are already 
widespread, as are franchised tax preparers and travel agencies. The real estate industry 
also has experienced a rapid increase in franchising.
Also, franchising is attracting more women and minority business owners in the 
United States than ever before. One reason is that special outreach programs designed 
to encourage franchisee diversity have developed. Consider Angela Trammel, a young 
mother of two. She had been laid off from her job at the Marriott after 9/11. Since she 
was a member of a Curves Fitness Center and liked the concept of empowering women 
to become physically fit, she began researching the cost of purchasing a Curves franchise 
and ways to finance the business. “I was online looking for financing, and I linked to 
Enterprise Development Group in Washington, DC. I knew that they had diverse clients.” 
The cost for the franchise was $19,500, but it took $60,000 to open the doors to her 
fitness center. “Applying for a loan to start the business was much harder than buying a 
house,” said Trammel. Just three years later, Angela and her husband, Ernest, own three 
Curves Fitness Centers with 12 employees. Recently, since giving birth to her third child, 
she has found the financial freedom and flexibility needed to care for her busy family. 
In fact, within a three-year period, the Trammels grew their annual household income 
from $80,000 to $250,000.21 Franchisors such as Wendy’s, McDonald’s, Burger King, and 
Church’s Chicken all have special corporate programs to attract minority and women 
franchisees. Just as important, successful women and minority franchisees are willing to 
get involved by offering advice and guidance to new franchisees.
Herman Petty, the first African-American McDonald’s franchisee, remembers that 
the company provided a great deal of help while he worked to establish his first 
units. In turn, Petty traveled to help other black franchisees, and he invited new 
franchisees to gain hands-on experience in his Chicago restaurants 
before starting their own establishments. In 1972, Petty also orga-
nized a support group, the National Black McDonald’s Operators 
Association, to help black franchisees in other areas. Today, mem-
bers of this association own nearly 1,400 McDonald’s restaurants 
throughout the United States, South Africa, and the Caribbean with 
annual sales of more than $3.2 billion. “We are really concentrat-
ing on helping our operators to be successful both operationally 
and financially,” says Craig Welburn, the McDonald’s franchisee 
who leads the group.
Dual-branded franchises, in which two franchisors offer their 
products together, are a new small-business trend. For example, 
in 1993, pleased with the success of its first cobranded restaurant 
with Texaco in Beebe, Arkansas, McDonald’s now has more than 
400 cobranded restaurants in the United States. Also, an agree-
ment between franchisors Doctor’s Associates, Inc., and TCBY 
Enterprises, Inc., now allows franchisees to sell SUBWAY sand-
wiches and TCBY yogurt in the same establishment.

Part 2   Business Ownership and Entrepreneurship
owned and operated by franchisees is significantly higher than the success rate for 
other independently owned small businesses. In a recent nationwide Gallup poll of 944 
franchise owners, 94 percent of franchisees indicated that they were very or somewhat 
successful, only 5 percent believed that they were very unsuccessful or somewhat 
unsuccessful, and 1 percent did not know. Despite these impressive statistics, franchising 
is not a guarantee of success for either franchisees or franchisors. Too rapid expansion, 
inadequate capital or management skills, and a host of other problems can cause failure 
for both franchisee and franchisor. Thus, for example, the Dizzy Dean’s Beef and Burger 
franchise is no longer in business. Timothy Bates, a Wayne State University economist, 
warns, “Despite the hype that franchising is the safest way to go when starting a new 
business, the research just doesn’t bear that out.” Just consider Boston Chicken, which 
once had more than 1,200 restaurants before declaring bankruptcy in 1998.
Advantages of Franchising
Franchising plays a vital role in our economy and soon may become the dominant 
form of retailing. Why? Because franchising offers advantages to both the franchisor 
and the franchisee.
To the Franchisor  The franchisor gains fast and well-controlled distribution of its 
products without incurring the high cost of constructing and operating its own outlets. 
The franchisor thus has more capital available to expand production and to use for 
advertising. At the same time, it can ensure, through the franchise agreement, that out-
lets are maintained and operated according to its own standards.
The franchisor also benefits from the fact that the franchisee—a sole proprietor in 
most cases—is likely to be very highly motivated to succeed. The success of the fran-
chise means more sales, which translate into higher royalties for the franchisor.
To the Franchisee  The franchisee gets the opportunity to start a business with lim-
ited capital and to make use of the business experience of others. Moreover, an outlet 
with a nationally advertised name, such as RadioShack, McDonald’s, or Century 21, 
has guaranteed customers as soon as it opens.
If business problems arise, the franchisor gives the franchisee 
guidance and advice. This counseling is primarily responsible for 
the very high degree of success enjoyed by franchises. In most cases, 
the franchisee does not pay for such help.
The franchisee also receives materials to use in local advertising 
and can take part in national promotional campaigns sponsored by 
the franchisor. McDonald’s and its franchisees, for example, consti-
tute one of the nation’s top 20 purchasers of advertising. Finally, the 
franchisee may be able to minimize the cost of advertising, supplies, 
and various business necessities by purchasing them in cooperation 
with other franchisees.
Disadvantages of Franchising
The main disadvantage of franchising affects the franchisee, and 
it arises because the franchisor retains a great deal of control. The 
franchisor’s contract can dictate every aspect of the business: decor, 
design of employee uniforms, types of signs, and all the details of 
business operations. All Burger King French fries taste the same 
because all Burger King franchisees have to make them the same way.
Contract disputes are the cause of many lawsuits. For example, 
Rekha Gabhawala, a Dunkin’ Donuts franchisee in Milwaukee, 
alleged that the franchisor was forcing her out of business so that 
the company could profit by reselling the downtown franchise 
to someone else; the company, on the other hand, alleged that 
The growth of franchising. Franchising is designed 
to provide a tested formula for success, along with 
ongoing advice and training. The franchisor, such 
as Wendy’s or Burger King, supplies a known and 
advertised business name, management skills, the 
required training and materials, and a method of doing 
business. Franchising, however, is not a guarantee of 
success for either franchisees or franchisors.

Gabhawala breached the contract by not running the business according to company 
standards. In another case, Dunkin’ Donuts sued Chris Romanias, its franchisee in 
Pennsylvania, alleging that Romanias intentionally underreported gross sales to the 
company. Romanias, on the other hand, alleged that Dunkin’ Donuts, Inc., breached 
the contract because it failed to provide assistance in operating the franchise. Other 
franchisees claim that contracts are unfairly tilted toward the franchisors. Yet others 
have charged that they lost their franchise and investment because their franchisor 
would not approve the sale of the business when they found a buyer.
To arbitrate disputes between franchisors and franchisees, the National Franchise 
Mediation Program was established in 1993 by 30 member firms, including Burger King 
Corporation, McDonald’s Corporation, and Wendy’s International, Inc. Negotiators 
have since resolved numerous cases through mediation. Recently, Carl’s Jr. brought in 
one of its largest franchisees to help set its system straight, making most franchisees 
happy for the first time in years. The program also helped PepsiCo settle a long-term 
contract dispute and renegotiate its franchise agreements.
Because disagreements between franchisors and franchisees have increased in recent 
years, many franchisees have been demanding government regulation of franchising. In 
1997, to avoid government regulation, some of the largest franchisors proposed a new 
self-policing plan to the Federal Trade Commission.
Franchise holders pay for their security, usually with a one-time franchise fee and 
continuing royalty and advertising fees, collected as a percentage of sales. A SUBWAY 
franchisee pays an initial franchise fee of $15,000 and an annual fee of 8 percent of 
gross sales. In some fields, franchise agreements are not uniform. One franchisee may 
pay more than another for the same services.
Even success can cause problems. Sometimes a franchise is so successful that the fran-
chisor opens its own outlet nearby, in direct competition—although franchisees may fight 
back. For example, a court recently ruled that Burger King could not enter into direct 
competition with the franchisee because the contract was not specific on the issue. A 
spokesperson for one franchisor contends that the company “gives no geographical pro-
tection” to its franchise holders and thus is free to move in on them. Franchise operators 
work hard. They often put in 10- and 12-hour days, six days a week. The International 
Franchise Association advises prospective franchise purchasers to investigate before invest-
ing and to approach buying a franchise cautiously. Franchises vary widely in approach 
as well as in products. Some, such as Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins, demand long 
hours. Others, such as Great Clips hair salons and Albert’s Family Restaurants, are more 
appropriate for those who do not want to spend many hours at their stores.
Global Perspectives in Small Business
For small American businesses, the world is becoming smaller. National and 
international economies are growing more and more interdependent as political 
leadership and national economic directions change and trade barriers diminish or 
disappear. Globalization and instant worldwide communications are rapidly shrinking 
distances at the same time that they are expanding business opportunities. According 
to a recent study, the Internet is increasingly important to small-business strategic 
thinking, with more than 50 percent of those surveyed indicating that the Internet 
represented their most favored strategy for growth. This was more than double the 
next-favored choice, strategic alliances reflecting the opportunity to reach both global 
and domestic customers. The Internet and online payment systems enable even very 
small businesses to serve international customers. In fact, technology now gives small 
businesses the leverage and power to reach markets that were once limited solely to 
large corporations. No wonder the number of businesses exporting their goods and 
services has tripled since 1990, with two-thirds of that boom coming from companies 
with fewer than 20 employees.22
The SBA offers help to the nation’s small-business owners who want to enter the 
world markets. The SBA’s efforts include counseling small firms on how and where to

market overseas, matching U.S. small-business executives with potential overseas cus-
tomers, and helping exporters to secure financing. The agency brings small U.S. firms 
into direct contact with potential overseas buyers and partners. The SBA International 
Trade Loan program provides guarantees of up to $5 million in loans to small-busi-
ness owners. These loans help small firms in expanding or developing new export mar-
kets. The U.S. Commercial Service, a Commerce Department division, aids small and 
medium-sized businesses in selling overseas. The division’s global network includes more 
than 100 offices in the United States and 151 others in 75 countries around the world.23
Consider Daniel J. Nanigian, President of Nanmac Corporation in Framingham, 
Massachusetts. This company manufactures temperature sensors used in a wide range 
of industrial applications. With an export strategy aimed at growing revenues in diverse 
foreign markets including China, the Nanmac Corporation experienced explosive 
growth in 2009. The company nearly doubled its sales from $2.7 million in 2008 to 
$5.1 million in 2009. The company’s international sales, at $300,000 in 2004, reached 
$700,000 in 2009 and $1.7 million in 2010. Its administrative, sales, and manufactur-
ing employees have increased by 80 percent.
The company has a strong presence in China and is expanding in other markets, as 
well, including Latin America, Singapore, and Russia. Under Nanigian’s guidance, the 
company has developed creative solutions and partnerships to help maximize its pres-
ence internationally. As part of its China strategy, Nanmac partners with distributors, 
recruits European and in-country sales representatives, uses a localized Chinese Web 
site, and relies for advice on the export assistance programs of the Massachusetts Small 
Business Development Center Network’s Massachusetts Export Center. The strategy, 
along with travel to China to conduct technical training seminars and attend trade 
shows and technical conferences, has helped to grow Nanmac’s Chinese client list from 
1 in 2003 to more than 30 accounts today. Mr. Nanigian received SBA’s 2010 Small 
Business Exporter of the Year Award.24
International trade will become more important to small-business owners as they 
face unique challenges in the new century. Small businesses, which are expected to 
remain the dominant form of organization in this country, must be prepared to adapt 
to significant demographic and economic changes in the world marketplace.
This chapter ends our discussion of American business today. From here on, we shall 
be looking closely at various aspects of business operations. We begin, in the next chapter, 
with a discussion of management—what management is, what managers do, and how 
they work to coordinate the basic economic resources within a business organization.
Inside
Business
JoAnn Brewer and Christi Sterling had never run a com-
pany before they teamed up to found Locker Lookz. After 
helping their preteen daughters create accessories to dress 
up their school lockers as a way to show off their personal 
style, they recognized a viable business opportunity. “Self-
expression is such a huge, huge thing at this age,” explains 
Sterling. “Not everybody gets to see your bedroom at 
home, but everyone gets to see your locker.”
Part of the fun for customers is mixing and matching 
products for a unique look. For this reason, Locker Lookz’s 
Web site has an interactive design feature to help girls visu-
alize how different products go together. The site also offers 
instructional videos so customers know how to install and 
remove accessories without damaging the locker. Coming 
soon: Accessories to personalize boys’ lockers.
Questions
1.	 When Locker Lookz needed to raise money quickly, 
why do you think the founders sought financing from 
family, friends, and a church investment group rather 
than talking with banks?
2.	 If you were writing a business plan for Locker Lookz, 
what would you recommend as an exit strategy? 
Explain your answer.

Chapter 5   Small Business, Entrepreneurship, and Franchises	
157
Define what a small business is and recognize the 
fields in which small businesses are concentrated.
A small business is one that is independently owned and 
operated for profit and is not dominant in its field. There are 
about 27.5 million businesses in this country, and more than 
99.7 percent of them are small businesses. Small businesses 
employ more than half the nation’s workforce. About 69 
percent of small businesses survive at least two years and 
about 50 percent survive at least five years. More than half 
of all small businesses are in retailing and services.
Identify the people who start small businesses 
and the reasons why some succeed and many fail.
Such personal characteristics as independence, desire to 
create a new enterprise, and willingness to accept a challenge 
may encourage individuals to start small businesses. Various 
external circumstances, such as special expertise or even the 
loss of a job, also can supply the motivation to strike out on 
one’s own. Poor planning and lack of capital and management 
experience are the major causes of small-business failures.
Assess the contributions of small businesses to 
our economy.
Small businesses have been responsible for a wide variety of 
inventions and innovations, some of which have given rise 
to new industries. Historically, small businesses have created 
the bulk of the nation’s new jobs. Further, they have mounted 
effective competition to larger firms. They provide things 
that society needs, act as suppliers to larger firms, and serve 
as customers of other businesses, both large and small.
Describe the advantages and disadvantages of 
operating a small business.
The advantages of smallness in business include the 
opportunity to establish personal relationships with customers 
and employees, the ability to adapt to changes quickly, 
independence, and simplified record keeping. The major 
disadvantages are the high risk of failure, the limited potential 
for growth, and the limited ability to raise capital.
Explain how the Small Business Administration 
helps small businesses.
The Small Business Administration (SBA) was created in 
1953 to assist and counsel the nation’s millions of small-
business owners. The SBA offers management courses 
and workshops; managerial help, including one-to-one 
counseling through SCORE; various publications; and 
financial assistance through guaranteed loans and SBICs. It 
places special emphasis on aid to minority-owned businesses, 
including those owned by women.
Explain the concept and types of 
franchising.
A franchise is a license to operate an individually owned 
business as though it were part of a chain. The franchisor 
provides a known business name, management skills, a 
method of doing business, and the training and required 
materials. The franchisee contributes labor and capital, 
operates the franchised business, and agrees to abide by the 
provisions of the franchise agreement. There are three major 
categories of franchise agreements.
Analyze the growth of franchising and its 
advantages and disadvantages.
Franchising has grown tremendously since the mid-1970s. 
The franchisor’s major advantage in franchising is fast and 
well-controlled distribution of products with minimal capital 
outlay. In return, the franchisee has the opportunity to open 
a business with limited capital, to make use of the business 
experience of others, and to sell to an existing clientele. For 
this, the franchisee usually must pay both an initial franchise 
fee and a continuing royalty based on sales. He or she also 
must follow the dictates of the franchise with regard to 
operation of the business.
Worldwide business opportunities are expanding for small 
businesses. The SBA assists small-business owners in penetrat-
ing foreign markets. The next century will present unique 
challenges and opportunities for small-business owners.

Discussion Questions
Murray’s Cheese began in New York’s Greenwich Village in 
1940, as a wholesale butter and egg shop owned by a Jewish 
veteran of the Spanish Civil War named Murray Greenberg. 
When the current president Rob Kaufelt purchased the shop in 
1991, it was little more than a local hole-in-the-wall. Kaufelt 
and his staff made the decision to focus on high-quality gour-
met cheeses from around the world. Today, people come from 
all over to sample Murray’s cheeses and to take classes or 
attend its Cheese U boot camp to learn about cheese. Although 
Murray’s has extended its product line to include gourmet 
meats, crackers, olives, and dried fruit, cheese remains its core 
product. In fact, Murray’s Cheese has been voted by Forbes 
as “the best cheese shop” and it is expanding to three other 
stores. Its success prompted Kroger to seek it out as a partner 
in its chain of supermarkets, a step that included intensively 
training Kroger employees in the fine points of selling Murray’s 
products and the creation of a 300-page cheese service guide 
for them.
“We are little and they are very big,” says Murray’s managing 
director, Liz Thorpe, in speaking of Kroger. “So it’s a very interest-
ing model for us. We’ve begun operating cheese shops in Kroger 
delis that are similar to our New York shops. This allows us  
to bring our knowledge and expertise on sourcing, production 
selection, education, and customer service to a different  
format. . . . We’re actually going to be opening 50 of these  
shops in the next 36 months.”
Murray’s is still small, with about 70 employees, and has 
an advertising budget of zero dollars. Instead of advertising, 
Murray’s relies on providing great customer service and creating 
positive word of mouth to promote its products and to secure its 
reputation. Personal selling is key. The company recruits salespeo-
ple who are passionate about both cheese and people and trains 
them carefully. The key is to inform customers about the store’s 
many unique products and persuade them to taste and then pur-
chase. The staff enjoys listening to customers, gaining an under-
standing of their interests, and trying to find the right ­product to

satisfy their needs. Their efforts often succeed in getting custom-
ers to purchase more and to make repeat buys.
All customers get to taste free samples of cheese before they 
buy it. “We like knowing the folks who walk in our door and hav-
ing everyone taste the cheese,” said the managing director. “It’s 
part of the shopping experience. That said, we are getting more 
sophisticated about how we communicate with people. E-mail 
marketing continues to be really critical, and we’re starting to 
take advantage of social networking outlets like Twitter. For 
people who are into cheese and into Murray’s, it’s a great way for 
them to be directly tapped into knowing what’s going on right 
this second.”
What continues to appeal to sophisticated shoppers about 
Murray’s is that cheese is an affordable luxury. A wine and cheese 
party for a dozen people, for instance, can fit almost any budget, 
and Murray’s salespeople are happy to provide suggestions and 
samples to assist in the selection. Murray’s manager also credits 
popular media like the Food Network with helping to popular-
ize food in general, and cheese in particular. After all, he says, 
cheeses “don’t have to be improved upon or fortified. They are 
naturally good for you.”25
Questions
1.	 How does Murray’s overcome one of the most common limi-
tations facing small companies: its nonexistent advertising 
budget?
2.	 What are some of the advantages of being a small business 
that Murray’s can (or does) take advantage of? What disad-
vantages might it face as a small firm?
3.	 Do you think the partnership with Kroger will have a negative 
or a positive effect on the unique experience customers expect 
from Murray’s? Why?
Fashionable, affordable prescription eyeglasses sold directly to 
customers—that’s the business vision of Warby Parker, a fast-
growing small firm based in New York City. Founded by four 
friends from the Wharton business school, Warby Parker uses 
easy-on-the-eyes styling and easy-on-the-budget pricing to com-
pete with national chains such as LensCrafters as well as with 
neighborhood optical shops. Its exclusive retro-style prescription 
glasses are priced under $100, with prescription sunglasses priced 
at $150. Warby Parker’s affordable prices include extras such 
as free shipping, free in-home frame try-ons, and a money-back 
guarantee. Just as important is that, for every pair of glasses pur-
chased, the company donates one pair to someone in need.
 Rather than pay to license famous brand names for its frames, 
Warby Parker designs its own, inspired by styles from the 1950s 
and 1960s and manufactured in China. Based on each customer’s  
individual prescription, the company has the optical lenses 
made to order by a U.S. lab. After the lenses are set in place, the 
­finished product is inspected twice before glasses are shipped to 
customers.
Because Warby Parker’s prices are significantly lower than 
those of traditional eyeglass providers, customers can afford to 
buy frames as fashion accessories, not just for vision correction. 
Co-founder David Gilboa points out that while U.S. consumers 
typically buy new eyeglasses every other year, many Warby Parker 
customers “are buying six, seven, eight pairs at a time.” They 
choose different frames for different occasions, such as one pair 
for going to work and another pair for going out with friends, 
and they buy frames to fit with particular outfits. The largest 
single order Warby Parker ever received was from a customer who 
ordered 14 pairs at once.
Warby Parker operates a showroom at its headquarters in the 
hip SoHo section of New York, plus seven other showrooms inside 
fashion boutiques across the country. It also invites customers to 
call a toll-free number for information and ordering. The main 
focus, however, is on the interactive Web site, where custom-
ers can browse more than two dozen frames, narrow down the 
choice by color, shape, and size, and upload a digital headshot 
for a virtual “try on” before ordering. Customers can order up to 
five frames and try them on at home for five days—enough time 
to post photos on Warby Parker’s Facebook page, if they choose, 
and ask for feedback on which frames are the most flattering. 
Shipping and returns are paid by the company, which takes the 
risk out of trying and buying.
Customers feel good about buying from Warby Parker because 
they save money and they know each purchase covers a donation 
of eyeglasses. The company’s “buy one, give one” policy allows it 
to donate more than 100,000 pairs of eyeglasses a year to people 
in need worldwide through a connection with the nonprofit orga-
nization VisionSpring. Now, with the help of venture capital fund-
ing, Warby Parker is expanding. It has more than 50 employees 
and uses social media such as Twitter, Tumblr, and Pinterest to 
publicize its business vision. Because satisfied customers tell friends 
and relatives about their experiences, “over 50 percent of our sales 
are driven by word of mouth,” says co-founder Neil Blumenthal.26
Questions
1.	 If you were writing a business plan for Warby Parker, what criti-
cal risks and challenges would you mention? What are the busi-
ness implications of each risk or challenge?
2.	 Why would Warby Parker have eyeglass frames made in China 
but optical lenses made in America?
3.	 Do you agree with Warby Parker’s decision to open show-
rooms inside trendy boutiques in addition to operating on the 
Internet? Explain your answer.

Discovery statement: One of the objectives in this chapter was to 
make you aware of the advantages and disadvantages of owning 
a franchise.
Assignment
1.	 Assume that after evaluating your skills, experience, and finan-
cial situation, you have decided to purchase a franchise in your 
community. Identify and describe sources where you can obtain 
information on what the franchise package should contain.
2.	 List at least five reasons why you should choose franchising 
rather than starting a new, independent business.

4.	 Make a list of possible advantages and disadvantages of the 
franchise you are considering. What are your rights and your 
obligations as a franchisee?
3 	DEVELOPING CRITICAL-THINKING SKILLS
Small businesses play a vital role in our economy. They not only 
contribute to technological innovation and to the creation of 
many new jobs but also ensure that customers have an alternative 
to the products and services offered by large firms. In addition, 
by making parts for large firms at a lower cost than the large 
firms could make the parts themselves, they help to keep the lid 
on consumer prices. Regardless of our need for them, many small 
businesses fail within their first five years. Why is this so?
Assignment
1.	 Identify several successful small businesses in your community.
2.	 Identify one small business that has failed.
3.	 Gather enough information about those businesses to answer 
the following questions:
a.	 What role do small businesses play in your community?
b.	 Why are they important?
c.	 Why did the business fail?
d.	 What was the most important reason for its failure?
e.	 How might the business have survived?
4.	 Summarize what you have learned about the impact of small 
businesses on your community. Give the summary to your 
instructor.
4 	BUILDING TEAM SKILLS
A business plan is a written statement that documents the nature 
of a business and how that business intends to achieve its goals. 
Although entrepreneurs should prepare a business plan before 
starting a business, the plan also serves as an effective guide later 
on. The plan should concisely describe the business’s mission, 
the amount of capital it requires, its target market, competition, 
resources, production plan, marketing plan, organizational plan, 
assessment of risk, and financial plan.
Assignment
1.	 Working in a team of four students, identify a company in 
your community that would benefit from using a business 
plan, or create a scenario in which a hypothetical entrepre-
neur wants to start a business.
2.	 Using the resources of the library or the Internet and/or inter-
views with business owners, write a business plan incorporat-
ing the information in Table 5.3.
3.	 Present your business plan to the class.
5 	RESEARCHING DIFFERENT CAREERS
Many people dream of opening and operating their own busi-
nesses. Are you one of them? To be successful, entrepreneurs 
must have certain characteristics; their profiles generally differ 
from those of people who work for someone else. Do you know 
which personal characteristics make some entrepreneurs succeed 
and others fail? Do you fit the successful entrepreneur’s profile? 
What is your potential for opening and operating a successful 
small business?
Assignment
1.	 Use the resources of the library or the Internet to establish 
what a successful entrepreneur’s profile is and to determine 
whether your personal characteristics fit that profile. Internet 
addresses that can help you are www.smartbiz.com/sbs/arts/
ieb1.html and www.sba.gov (see “Start your Business” and 
“FAQ”). These sites have quizzes online that can help you to 
assess your personal characteristics. The SBA also has helpful 
brochures.
2.	 Interview several small-business owners. Ask them to describe 
the characteristics they think are necessary for being a suc-
cessful entrepreneur.
3.	 Using your findings, write a report that includes the following:
a.	 A profile of a successful small-business owner
b.	 A comparison of your personal characteristics with the 
profile of the successful entrepreneur
c.	 A discussion of your potential as a successful small-busi-
ness owner

Chapter 5   Small Business, Entrepreneurship, and Franchises	
161
Independent and family-owned for more than 140 years, 
Graeter’s has successfully made the transition from a 
19th-century mom-and-pop ice cream business to a 21st-century 
corporation with three manufacturing facilities, dozens of ice 
cream shops, and hundreds of employees. Much of the 
company’s success over the years has been due to the family’s 
strong and enduring entrepreneurial spirit. 
SMALL BUSINESS, BIG AMBITIONS
The road to small-business success started with cofounder Louis 
Charles Graeter, who developed the startup’s first flavors, insisted 
on only the finest ingredients, and made all his ice cream by hand 
in small batches to ensure freshness and quality. After his death, 
his wife and cofounder Regina maintained the same high level of 
quality as she led the company through three decades of aggres-
sive growth. Her great-grandson, CEO Richard Graeter II, says 
that “without her strength, fortitude, and foresight, there would 
be no Graeter’s ice cream today.”
Richard, Bob, and Chip, great-grandsons of the founders, 
are the fourth generation to own and operate Graeter’s. They 
grew up in the business, and now they share responsibility for 
the firm’s day-to-day management and for determining its future 
direction. Bob worked his way up to vice president of operations, 
starting with a management position in one of the Graeter’s ice-
cream shops. Chip, currently vice president of retail operations, 
handled all kinds of jobs in Graeter’s stores as a teenager. He uses 
this first-hand knowledge of customer relations to fine-tune every 
store function. 
Richard Graeter became the company’s CEO in 2007. “Even 
though I have the title of CEO, in a family business titles don’t 
mean a whole lot,” he comments. “The functions that I am doing 
now as CEO, I was doing as executive vice president for years . . . 
It really was and remains a partnership with my two cousins . . . 
Our fathers brought us into the business at an early age . . . 
I think most important is we saw our fathers and their dedication 
and the fact that, you know, they came home later, they came 
home tired, they got up early and went to work before we ever got 
up to go to school in the morning, and you see that dedication 
and appreciate that—that is what keeps your business going.”
Graeter continues, “It can be challenging to work with your 
family. My father and I didn’t always see things the same way. But 
on the other hand, there is a lot of strength in the family 
relationship . . . we certainly had struggles, and family businesses 
do struggle, especially with transition . . . but we found people to 
help us, including lawyers, accountants, and a family-business 
psychologist.”
GROWING BEYOND CINCINNATI
To expand beyond Cincinnati without diverting resources from 
the existing stores and factory, the third generation of Graeter’s 
family owners decided to license a handful of franchise operators. 
One franchise operation was so successful that it even opened 
its own factory. A few years ago, however, the fourth generation 
switched gears on growth and repurchased all the stores of its 
last remaining franchisee. “When you think about Graeter’s,” says 
the CEO, “the core of Graeter’s is the quality of the product. You 
can’t franchise your core. So by franchising our manufacturing, 
that created substantial risk for the organization, because the 
customer doesn’t know that it is a franchise. . . . They know it is 
Graeter’s. . . . You really have to rely on the intention and good-
will of the individual franchisees to make the product the way you 
would make it, and that is not an easy thing to guarantee.”
After working with consultants to carefully analyze the situa-
tion and evaluate alternative paths to future growth, the found-
er’s great-grandsons decided against further franchising. Instead, 
they pursued nationwide distribution through a large network 
of grocery stores and supermarket chains. They also built a new 
facility to increase production capacity and hired experienced 
executives to help manage the expanded business. 
As a private company, Graeter’s can take actions like these with-
out worrying about the reaction of the stock market. Specifically, 
Graeter’s is an S-corporation, which allows it limited liability pro-
tection coupled with the benefit of not being taxed as a corpora-
tion. Instead, the three owners—who are the stockholders—pay only 
personal income taxes on the corporation’s profits. In the event of 
significant legal or tax code changes, Graeter’s owners do have the 
option of choosing a different form of corporate organization.27
Questions
	 1.	 Graeter’s current management team bought the business 
from their parents, who did not have a formal succession 
plan in place to indicate who would do what. Do you think 
the current team should have such a plan specifying who is 
to step into the business, when, and with what responsibili-
ties? Why or why not?
	 2.	 Graeter’s hired management consultants to help improve 
its training procedures and expand distribution. “I think my 
cousins and I all have come to realize we can’t do it alone,” 
says the CEO. Why do you think the management team made 
this decision? Does the involvement of outside consultants 
move Graeter’s further from its roots as a family business?
	 3.	 Do you agree with Graeter’s decision to stop franchising? 
Explain your answer.

information about the background of the company, choice of 
the legal business form, information on the product or services 
to be offered, and descriptions of potential customers, current 
competitors, and the business’s future. Chapter 4 in your text-
book, “Choosing a Form of Business Ownership,” and Chapter 5, 
“Small Business, Entrepreneurship, and Franchises,” can help you 
to answer some of the questions in this part of the business plan.
THE COMPANY AND INDUSTRY COMPONENT
The company and industry analysis should include the answers to 
at least the following questions:
2.1. What is the legal form of your business? Is your business a 
sole proprietorship, a partnership, or a corporation?
2.2. What licenses or permits will you need, if any?
2.3. Is your business a new independent business, a takeover, an 
expansion, or a franchise?
2.4. If you are dealing with an existing business, how did your 
company get to the point where it is today?
    2.5. What does your business do, and how does it satisfy custom-
ers’ needs?
    2.6. How did you choose and develop the products or services 
to be sold, and how are they different from those currently 
on the market?
    2.7. What industry do you operate in, and what are the indus-
try-wide trends?
    2.8. Who are the major competitors in your industry?
    2.9. Have any businesses recently entered or exited? Why did 
they leave?
2.10. Why will your business be profitable, and what are your 
growth opportunities?
2.11. Does any part of your business involve e-business?

Management and 
Organization
This Part of the book deals with the organization—the “thing” that is a business. We begin with a discussion 
of the management functions involved in developing and operating a business. Next, we analyze the organization’s 
elements and structure. Then we consider a firm’s operations that are related to the production of goods and 
services.

IBM’s New CEO Feels Technological Leadership Is Key
IBM had just begun its second century of business when it appointed Virginia Rometty 
as its first female CEO. IBM made technology history throughout its first century, with 
innovations such as the automatic tabulating machine, FORTRAN programming language, 
the personal computer, and the speedy Watson supercomputer that scored decisive wins 
on the television show Jeopardy. During the decade before Rometty became CEO, IBM 
sharpened its focus on serving business customers by acquiring PricewaterhouseCoopers 
Consulting and selling its consumer-oriented PC business to China’s Lenovo.
When Rometty took over in 2012, IBM was already aiming to achieve the ambitious 
goal of generating an additional $20 billion in new revenue by 2015. She had joined IBM 30 
years before and managed the team that integrated PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting 
into the IBM organization. Later, heading up part of IBM’s services division, she gained 
senior-level experience in marketing and strategy. All these experiences have prepared 
Rometty for her responsibilities as CEO of a $100 billion company that employs nearly 
400,000 employees worldwide.
With the global economy in trouble, ongoing technological shifts, and increasingly 
intense competition, Rometty’s top priority is to keep reinventing the company. “We are 
different today than we were a decade ago,” she says, and moving quickly to adapt to the 
ever-changing business environment will help IBM extend its record of success. The com-
pany now makes more money from the sale of technology services and business software 
than from the sale of computers, the result of lucrative, long-term contracts with business 
and government customers. Because a significant amount of IBM’s future revenue will 
come from overseas customers, Rometty has appointed a senior vice president to head the 
Growth Markets unit and moved that unit’s headquarters to Shanghai, China. She contin-
ues to invest heavily in research and development activities for future growth, and is on the 
lookout for potential acquisitions that will give IBM an even bigger edge in delivering the 
services and software that business customers need to solve their most pressing problems.1
FYI
Did You Know?
Founded in 1911, IBM rings 
up more than $100 billion 
in annual revenue from 
global sales of software, 
services, and computers.
Inside
Business
T
he leadership employed at IBM illustrates that management can be one of the 
most exciting and rewarding professions available today. Depending on its size, 
a firm may employ a number of specialized managers who are responsible for 
particular areas of management, such as marketing, finance, and operations. That same 
organization also includes managers at several levels within the firm. In this chapter, 
we define management and describe the four basic management functions of planning, 
organizing, leading and motivating, and controlling. Then we focus on the types of man-
agers with respect to levels of responsibility and areas of expertise. Next, we focus on 
the skills of effective managers and the different roles managers must play. We examine 
several styles of leadership and explore the process by which managers make decisions. 
We also describe how total quality management can improve customer satisfaction.
What Is Management?
Management is the process of coordinating people and other resources to achieve 
the goals of an organization. As we saw in Chapter 1, most organizations make 
use of four kinds of resources: material, human, financial, and informational (see 
Figure 6.1).

Part 3   Management and Organization
Material resources are the tangible, physical 
resources an organization uses. For example, General 
Motors uses steel, glass, and fiberglass to produce cars 
and trucks on complex machine-driven assembly lines. 
A college or university uses books, classroom build-
ings, desks, and computers to educate students. And the 
Mayo Clinic uses operating room equipment, diagnostic 
machines, and laboratory tests to provide health care.
Perhaps the most important resources of any 
organization are its human resources—people. In fact, 
some firms live by the philosophy that their employees are 
their most important assets. Some managers believe that the 
way employees are developed and managed may have more 
impact on an organization than other vital components such as 
marketing, sound financial decisions about large expenditures, 
production, or use of technology. One such firm that takes 
pride in its employees is Southwest Airlines. Southwest treats 
its employees with the same respect and attention it gives its 
passengers. Southwest selectively seeks employees with upbeat 
attitudes and promotes from within 80 percent of the time. In 
decision making, everyone who will be affected is encouraged 
to get involved in the process. In an industry in which deregu-
lation, extreme price competition, and fluctuating fuel costs 
have eliminated several major competitors, Southwest keeps 
growing and making a profit because of its employees. Many 
experts would agree with Southwest’s emphasis on employees.
Financial resources are the funds an organization uses to 
meet its obligations to investors and creditors. A 7-Eleven con-
venience store obtains money from customers at the checkout 
counter and uses a portion of that money to pay its suppliers. Your college obtains 
money in the form of tuition, income from its endowments, and state and federal grants. 
It uses the money to pay utility bills, insurance premiums, and professors’ salaries.
Finally, many organizations increasingly find that they cannot afford to ignore 
information. External environmental conditions—including the economy, consumer 
markets, technology, politics, and cultural forces—are all changing so rapidly that a 
business that does not adapt probably will not survive. To adapt to change, the busi-
ness must know what is changing and how it is changing. Most companies gather 
information about their competitors to increase their knowledge about changes in 
their industry and to learn from other companies’ failures and successes.
It is important to realize that the four types of resources described earlier are only gen-
eral categories of resources. Within each category are hundreds or thousands of more specific 
resources. It is this complex mix of specific resources—and not simply “some of each” of 
the four general categories—that managers must coordinate to produce goods and services.
Another interesting way to look at management is in terms of the different func-
tions managers perform. These functions have been identified as planning, organizing, 
leading and motivating employees, and controlling. We look at each of these manage-
ment functions in the next section.

Basic Management Functions
When pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly decided to focus on the emerging market 
of China, the company reorganized its structure so that one of its six units would 
handle emerging markets, doubled its employee count from 1,100 to 2,200, and began 
construction on a second manufacturing plant in Suzhou, China. The company also 
implemented a partnering strategy in China to handle research and development. 
Eli Lilly’s key strategies include maximizing their core assets, 
accelerating new product launches, capitalizing on longer product 
life-cycles in areas like China, and establishing local alliances to 
access fast-growing market segments.2
Management functions such as those just described do not 
occur according to some rigid, preset timetable. Managers do not 
plan in January, organize in February, lead and motivate in March, 
and control in April. At any given time, managers may engage in a 
number of functions simultaneously. However, each function tends 
to lead naturally to others. Figure 6.2 provides a visual framework 
for a more detailed discussion of the four basic management func-
tions. How well managers perform these key functions determines 
whether a business is successful.
Planning
Planning, in its simplest form, is establishing organizational goals 
and deciding how to accomplish them. It is often referred to as 
the “first” management function because all other management 
functions depend on planning. Organizations such as Starbucks, 
Houston Community College system, and Facebook begin the 
planning process by developing a mission statement.
An organization’s mission is a statement of the basic purpose that makes that 
organization different from others. Starbucks’ mission statement, for example, is 
“to inspire and nurture the human spirit—one person, one cup, and one neighbor-
hood at a time.” Houston Community College’s mission is to provide an education 
for local citizens. Facebook’s mission statement is “to give people the power to 
share and make the world more open and connected.”3 Once an organization’s 
mission has been described in a mission statement, the next step is to engage in 
strategic planning.
Strategic Planning Process  The strategic planning process involves establishing 
an organization’s major goals and objectives and allocating resources to achieve them. 
Top management is responsible for strategic planning, although customers, products, 
competitors, and company resources are some of the factors that are analyzed in the 
strategic planning process.
Describe the four basic 
management functions: 
planning, organizing, 
leading and motivating, and 
controlling.

Superior human resources management can set 
a firm apart. Do you have a great business plan or 
product? A competitor can easily copy both. Great 
employees, however, are much harder to duplicate. 
That’s why being able to attract, train, and retain 
talented workers can give a firm a competitive 
advantage over its rivals.

Part 3   Management and Organization
In today’s rapidly changing business environment, constant 
internal or external changes may necessitate changes in a company’s 
goals, mission, or strategy. The time line for strategic plans is gener-
ally one to two years and can be as long as ten years. Strategic plans 
should be flexible and include action items, such as outlining how 
plans will be implemented.
Establishing Goals and Objectives  A goal is an end result 
that an organization is expected to achieve over a one- to ten-year 
period. An objective is a specific statement detailing what the orga-
nization intends to accomplish over a shorter period of time.
Goals and objectives can deal with a variety of factors, such as 
sales, company growth, costs, customer satisfaction, and employee 
morale. Whereas a small manufacturer may focus primarily on sales 
objectives for the next six months, a large firm may be more inter-
ested in goals that impact several years in the future. Starbucks, 
for example, has established several goals under its “Shared Planet” 
program to be completed in the next few years, specifically in the 
areas of ethical sourcing, environmental stewardship, and commu-
nity involvement. By 2015, Starbucks hopes to purchase 100 percent 
of its coffee from ethical sources or farmers who grow their coffee 
responsibly without permanently harming the environment. The company also hopes 
to combat climate change by encouraging farmers to prevent deforestation through the 
use of incentive programs. Starbucks hopes to make 100% of its cups reusable or recy-
clable by 2015. Also, the company hopes to use their stores to lead volunteer programs 
in each store’s community.4 Finally, goals are set at every level of an organization. Every 
member of an organization—the president of the company, the head of a department, 
and an operating employee at the lowest level—has a set of goals that he or she hopes 
to achieve.
The goals developed for these different levels must be consistent. However, it is 
likely that some conflict will arise. A production department, for example, may have 
a goal of minimizing costs. One way to do this is to produce only one type of prod-
uct and offer “no frills.” Marketing may have a goal of maximizing sales. One way 
to implement this goal is to offer customers a wide range of products and options. 
As part of goal setting, the manager who is responsible for both departments must 
achieve some sort of balance between conflicting goals. This balancing process is called 
optimization.
The optimization of conflicting goals requires insight and ability. Faced with the 
marketing-versus-production conflict just described, most managers probably would 
not adopt either viewpoint completely. Instead, they might decide on a reasonably 
diverse product line offering only the most widely sought-after options. Such a com-
promise would seem to be best for the whole organization.
SWOT Analysis  SWOT analysis is the identification and evaluation of a firm’s 
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Strengths and weaknesses are inter-
nal factors that affect a company’s capabilities. Strengths refer to a firm’s favorable 
characteristics and core competencies. Core competencies are approaches and pro-
cesses that a company performs well that may give it an advantage over its competi-
tors. These core competencies may help the firm attract financial and human resources 
and be more capable of producing products that better satisfy customers. Weaknesses 
refer to any internal limitations a company faces in developing or implementing plans. 
At times, managers have difficulty identifying and understanding the negative effects 
of weaknesses in their organizations.
External opportunities and threats exist independently of the firm. Opportunities 
refer to favorable conditions in the environment that could produce rewards for the 
organization. That is, opportunities are situations that exist but must be exploited for

What is your organization’s purpose? How is 
it different than other organizations? Those are 
the questions a firm’s mission statement like the one 
shown here should answer. Mission statements are 
meant for multiple audiences, including a company’s 
customers, investors, the general public, and 
employees. Most firms familiarize their personnel with 
their mission statements so they know what’s expected 
of them and what they should strive for.

the firm to benefit from them. Threats, on the other hand, are conditions or barriers 
that may prevent the firm from reaching its objectives. Opportunities and threats can 
stem from many sources within the business environment. For example, a competitor’s 
actions, new laws, economic changes, or new technology can be threats. Threats for 
some firms may be opportunities for others. Examples of strengths, weaknesses, oppor-
tunities, and threats are shown in Figure 6.3.
Digging Deep to Research Competitors
competitors’ pharmaceutical products are moving through 
regulatory channels, clues that help it plan the timing of its own 
introductions and its marketing campaigns.
No matter how much a company learns about its competitors’ 
strengths and weaknesses, the information is useless unless the 
right people see it. That’s why Egencia, a travel agency that 
serves business customers, maintains a “Know Your Enemy” 
internal site where employees can post and review competitive 
details. Then, when salespeople meet with customers, they can 
emphasize Egencia’s competitive strengths.

Ethical
Success or Failure?
When preparing a SWOT analysis, how 
far can companies go in researching their 
competition? Many firms carefully monitor 
social media comments in search of tidbits 
about their rivals, for example. What are the ethical limits of 
competitive research?
In general, companies are going too far when they rummage 
through a competitor’s trash cans, tap its phone lines, hack into 
its computer systems, or try to obtain proprietary information 
such as customer lists and product blueprints. On the other 
hand, visiting competitors’ publicly-available Web sites and 
Facebook pages, shopping their stores or showrooms, and 
watching for announcements of new products and price 
changes are all good ways to map the competitive landscape.

Part 3   Management and Organization
Types of Plans  Once goals and objectives have been set for the organization, man-
agers must develop plans for achieving them. A plan is an outline of the actions by 
which an organization intends to accomplish its goals and objectives. Just as it has 
different goals and objectives, the organization also develops several types of plans, as 
shown in Figure 6.4.
Resulting from the strategic planning process, an organization’s strategic plan is 
its broadest plan, developed as a guide for major policy setting and decision making. 
Strategic plans are set by the board of directors and top management and are generally 
designed to achieve the organization’s long-term goals. Thus, a firm’s strategic plan 
defines what business the company is in or wants to be in and the kind of company it 
is or wants to be. Gannett, a major publisher of 82 different newspapers, revamped its 
strategic plan in the face of a prolonged advertising slump. The firm’s plan involved 
increasing sports coverage and revamping its subscriber model in an effort to boost rev-
enues. The new strategic plan recognizes that subscribers increasingly obtain their news 
online in a digital format and implemented an online subscriber system. Customers 
can read between 5 and 15 articles per month for free, after which they have to pay.5
In addition to strategic plans, most organizations also employ several narrower 
kinds of plans. A tactical plan is a smaller scale plan developed to implement a strat-
egy. Most tactical plans cover a one- to three-year period. If a strategic plan will take 
five years to complete, the firm may develop five tactical plans, one covering each year. 
Tactical plans may be updated periodically as dictated by conditions and experience. 
Their more limited scope permits them to be changed more easily than strategies. 
IKEA has a tactical plan that involves opening three stores per year in China through 
2016. These stores must be located in urban areas near transit, such as train or light 
rail. Because Chinese infrastructure, income levels, lifestyles, and living spaces all differ 
from those of its customers in the west, IKEA must utilize a different tactical plan for 
its Chinese expansion.6

Chapter 6   Understanding the Management Process	
171
An operational plan is a type of plan designed to implement 
tactical plans. Operational plans are usually established for one 
year or less and deal with how to accomplish the organization’s 
specific objectives.
Regardless of how hard managers try, sometimes business activ-
ities do not go as planned. Today, most corporations also develop 
contingency plans along with strategies, tactical plans, and opera-
tional plans. A contingency plan is a plan that outlines alternative 
courses of action that may be taken if an organization’s other plans 
are disrupted or become ineffective. For instance, Air Canada was 
forced to enact its contingency plan for servicing aircraft after its 
normal supplier, Aveos Fleet Performance, suspended operations. 
Without warning, Aveos locked out 2,300 workers, filed for credit 
protection, and announced that it permanently closed its airframe 
maintenance operation. Luckily, Air Canada had a contingency plan 
in place to reroute aircraft to a supplier in Quebec for repairs.7
Organizing the Enterprise
After goal setting and planning, the manager’s second major function 
is organization. Organizing is the grouping of resources and activities 
to accomplish some end result in an efficient and effective manner. Consider the case 
of an inventor who creates a new product and goes into business to sell it. At first, 
the inventor will do everything on his or her own—purchase raw materials, make the 
product, advertise it, sell it, and keep business records. Eventually, as business grows, 
the inventor will need help. To begin with, he or she might hire a professional sales 
representative and a part-time bookkeeper. Later, it also might be necessary to hire sales 
staff, people to assist with production, and an accountant. As the inventor hires new 
personnel, he or she must decide what each person will do, to whom each person will 
report, and how each person can best take part in the organization’s activities. We discuss 
these and other facets of the organizing function in much more detail in Chapter 7.
Leading and Motivating
The leading and motivating function is concerned with the human resources within an 
organization. Specifically, leading is the process of influencing people to work toward 
a common goal. Motivating is the process of providing reasons for people to work 
in the best interests of an organization. Together, leading and motivating are often 
referred to as directing.
We have already noted the importance of an organization’s human resources. Because 
of this importance, leading and motivating are critical activities. Obviously, different peo-
ple do things for different reasons—that is, they have different motivations. Some are 
interested primarily in earning as much money as they can. Others may be spurred on 
by opportunities to get promoted. Part of a manager’s job, then, is to determine what 
factors motivate workers and to try to provide those incentives to encourage effective 
performance. Jeffrey R. Immelt, GE’s chairperson and CEO, has worked to transform GE 
into a leader in essential themes tied to world development, such as emerging markets, 
environmental solutions, demographics, and digital connections. He believes in giving 
freedom to his teams and wants them to come up with their own solutions. However, he 
does not hesitate to intervene if the situation demands. He believes that a leader’s primary 
role is to teach, and he makes people feel that he is willing to share what he has learned. 
Immelt also laid the vision for GE’s ambitious “ecomagination initiative” and has been 
named one of the “World’s Best CEOs” three times by Barron’s.8  A lot of research has 
been done on both motivation and leadership. As you will see in Chapter 10, research on 
motivation has yielded very useful information. However, research on leadership has been 
less successful. Despite decades of study, no one has discovered a general set of personal 
traits or characteristics that makes a good leader. Later in this chapter, we discuss leader-
ship in more detail.

Part 3   Management and Organization
Controlling Ongoing Activities
Controlling is the process of evaluating and regulating ongoing activities to ensure 
that goals are achieved. To see how controlling works, consider a rocket launched by 
NASA to place a satellite in orbit. Do NASA personnel simply fire the rocket and then 
check back in a few days to find out whether the satellite is in place? Of course not. 
The rocket is monitored constantly, and its course is regulated and adjusted as needed 
to get the satellite to its destination.
The control function includes three steps (see Figure 6.5). The first is setting stan-
dards with which performance can be compared. The second is measuring actual per-
formance and comparing it with the standard. The third is taking corrective action as 
necessary. Notice that the control function is circular in nature. The steps in the control 
function must be repeated periodically until the goal is achieved. For example, sup-
pose that Southwest Airlines establishes a goal of increasing profits by 12 percent. To 
ensure that this goal is reached, Southwest’s management might monitor its profit on 
a monthly basis. After three months, if profit has increased by 3 percent, management 
might be able to assume that plans are going according to schedule. In this case, it is 
likely that no action will be taken. However, if profit has increased by only 1 percent 
after three months, some corrective action is needed to get the firm on track. The par-
ticular action that is required depends on the reason for the small increase in profit.
Kinds of Managers
Managers can be classified in two ways: according to their level within an organization 
and according to their area of management. In this section, we use both perspectives to 
explore the various types of managers.
Levels of Management
For the moment, think of an organization as a three-story structure (as illustrated in 
Figure 6.6). Each story corresponds to one of the three general levels of management: 
top managers, middle managers, and first-line managers.
Top Managers  A top manager is an upper-level executive who guides and controls an 
organization’s overall fortunes. Top managers constitute a small group. In terms of plan-
ning, they are generally responsible for developing the organization’s mission. They also

determine the firm’s strategy. It takes years of hard work, long hours, and perseverance, 
as well as talent and no small share of good luck, to reach the ranks of top management 
in large companies. Common job titles associated with top managers are president, vice 
president, chief executive officer (CEO), and chief operating officer (COO).
Middle Managers  Middle managers probably make up the largest group of man-
agers in most organizations. A middle manager is a manager who implements the 
strategy and major policies developed by top management. Middle managers develop 
tactical plans and operational plans, and they coordinate and supervise the activities 
of first-line managers. Titles at the middle-management level include division manager, 
department head, plant manager, and operations manager.
First-Line Managers  A first-line manager is a manager who 
coordinates and supervises the activities of operating employ-
ees. First-line managers spend most of their time working with 
and motivating their employees, answering questions, and solving 
day-to-day problems. Most first-line managers are former oper-
ating employees who, owing to their hard work and potential, 
were promoted into management. Many of today’s middle and 
top managers began their careers on this first management level. 
Common titles for first-line managers include office manager, 
supervisor, and foreman.
Areas of Management Specialization
Organizational structure can also be divided into areas of 
management specialization (see Figure 6.7). The most common 
areas are finance, operations, marketing, human resources, and 
administration. Depending on its mission, goals, and objectives, 
an organization may include other areas as well—research and 
development (R&D), for example.
Financial Managers  A financial manager is primarily responsi-
ble for an organization’s financial resources. Accounting and invest-
ment are specialized areas within financial management. Because

Virgin Cola, Virgin Wine, Virgin Spa, Virgin Airlines—
and the list goes on. By 2014, Virgin Galactic, one of 
Branson’s newest companies, aims to launch paying 
customers into space.

financing affects the operation of the entire firm, many of the CEOs and presidents of 
this country’s largest companies are people who got their “basic training” as financial 
managers.
Operations Managers  An operations manager manages the systems that con-
vert resources into goods and services. Traditionally, operations management has been 
equated with manufacturing—the production of goods. However, in recent years, many 
of the techniques and procedures of operations management have been applied to the 
production of services and to a variety of nonbusiness activities. As with financial man-
agement, operations management has produced a large percentage of today’s company 
CEOs and presidents.
Marketing Managers  A marketing manager is responsible for facilitating the 
exchange of products between an organization and its customers or clients. Specific 
areas within marketing are marketing research, product management, advertising, pro-
motion, sales, and distribution. A sizable number of today’s company presidents have 
risen from the ranks of marketing management.
Human Resources Managers  A human resources manager is charged with 
managing an organization’s human resources programs. He or she engages in 
human resources planning; designs systems for hiring, training, and evaluating the 
performance of employees; and ensures that the organization follows government

Steve Jobs: Futurist Extraordinaire
To the outside world, Jobs was the face of Apple, introducing 
every new product with personal pride. Inside the company, he 
was a relentless innovator, always thinking about the next new 
thing and pushing for the next breakthrough. Over the years, 
Jobs changed the way people use computers, make phone calls, 
and listen to music. His leadership legacy is a strong, successful 
company with can-do spirit.

The late Steve Jobs was not just an

he cofounded—he was also an inspiration 
to many other business leaders, including Virgin 
Group’s entrepreneur-in-chief, Richard Branson. Observing 
that “all true leaders go about things in their own way,” 
Branson observes that Jobs’s success as CEO was due to his 
ability to envision things that others could not.
With Jobs as its visionary CEO, Apple introduced  
now-iconic products such as the iPhone, the iPad, and iTunes. 
Jobs was creative, charismatic, and autocratic. He made quick 
and confident decisions, pushing Apple to be the very best 
at what it does. At his insistence, any product carrying the 
company logo of an apple minus a bite had to be aesthetically 
distinctive, intuitive to use, and top quality.

regulations concerning employment practices. Some human 
resources managers make effective use of technology. For exam-
ple, more than 1 million job openings are posted on Monster.
com, which attracts about 23 million visitors monthly.9
Administrative Managers  An administrative manager (also 
called a general manager) is not associated with any specific func-
tional area but provides overall administrative guidance and leader-
ship. A hospital administrator is an example of an administrative 
manager. He or she does not specialize in operations, finance, mar-
keting, or human resources management but instead coordinates 
the activities of specialized managers in all these areas. In many 
respects, most top managers are really administrative managers.
Whatever their level in the organization and whatever area they 
specialize in, successful managers generally exhibit certain key skills 
and are able to play certain managerial roles. However, as we shall 
see, some skills are likely to be more critical at one level of manage-
ment than at another.
Key Skills of Successful 
Managers
As shown in Figure 6.8, managers need a variety of skills, including conceptual, 
analytic, interpersonal, technical, and communication skills.
Conceptual Skills
Conceptual skills involve the ability to think in abstract terms. Conceptual skills 
allow a manager to see the “big picture” and understand how the various parts of an 
organization or idea can fit together. For example, Jim Whitehurst of Red Hat, an open-
source technology company, strongly believes in the advantage offered by conceptual 
thinkers. He believes that managers should solicit creative ideas from all levels of the

organization in order to help them see the big picture better and to obtain a wide 
variety of creative viewpoints.10 These skills are useful in a wide range of situations, 
including the optimization of goals described earlier.
Analytic Skills
Employers expect managers to use analytic skills to identify problems correctly, generate 
reasonable alternatives, and select the “best” alternatives to solve problems. Top-level 
managers especially need these skills because they need to discern the important issues 
from the less important ones, as well as recognize the underlying reasons for different 
situations. Managers who use these skills not only address a situation but also correct 
the initial event or problem that caused it to occur. Thus, these skills are vital to run a 
business efficiently and logically.
Interpersonal Skills
Interpersonal skills involve the ability to deal effectively with other people, both 
inside and outside an organization. Examples of interpersonal skills are the ability to 
relate to people, understand their needs and motives, and show genuine compassion. 
Howard Schultz, founder and CEO of Starbucks, used his knowledge of interpersonal 
communication to save the company recently. Schultz quickly shut down 800 poorly 
performing stores, laid off 4,000 employees, retrained staff, modernized technology, 
and improved operations. Despite these drastic changes, employees are still loyal to the 
company and motivated for change because of Schultz’s commitment to community 
and employee growth. For example, he refused to reduce employee health coverage 
because this would “sap the reservoir of trust” that employees have. While it may be 
obvious that a CEO such as Schultz must be able to work with employees throughout 
the organization, it’s not so obvious that middle and first-line managers must also 
possess these interpersonal skills.11
Technical Skills
Technical skills involve specific skills needed to accomplish a specialized activity. For 
example, the skills engineers and machinists need to do their jobs are technical skills. 
First-line managers (and, to a lesser extent, middle managers) need the technical skills 
relevant to the activities they manage. Although these managers 
may not perform the technical tasks themselves, they must be able 
to train subordinates, answer questions, and otherwise provide 
guidance and direction. A first-line manager in the accounting 
department of the Hyatt Corporation, for example, must be able to 
perform computerized accounting transactions and help employees 
complete the same accounting task. In general, top managers do not 
rely on technical skills as heavily as managers at other levels. Still, 
understanding the technical side of a business is an aid to effective 
management at every level.
Communication Skills
Communication skills, both oral and written, involve the ability 
to speak, listen, and write effectively. Managers need both oral and 
written communication skills. Because a large part of a manager’s 
day is spent conversing with others, the ability to speak and listen is 
critical. Oral communication skills are used when a manager makes 
sales presentations, conducts interviews, and holds press conferences. 
Written communication skills are important because a manager’s 
ability to prepare letters, e-mails, memos, sales reports, and other 
written documents may spell the difference between success and 
failure. Computers, smartphones, and other high-tech devices make 
communication in today’s business world both easier and more 
How good are your managerial skills? To be 
successful, managers must master and simultaneously 
utilize a number of  skills, including: technical skills 
that aid with specialized work; conceptual skills that 
foster abstract thinking; and interpersonal skills to 
help manage and motivate their employees. Which of 
these skills will you need to work on as you build your 
career?

Leadership
Leadership has been defined broadly as the ability to influence others. A leader can 
use his or her power to affect the behavior of others. Leadership is different from 
management in that a leader strives for voluntary cooperation, whereas a manager may 
have to depend on coercion to change employee behavior.
Formal and Informal Leadership
Some experts make distinctions between formal leadership and informal leadership. 
Formal leaders have legitimate power of position. They have authority within an 
organization to influence others to work for the organization’s objectives. Informal 
leaders usually have no such authority and may or may not exert their influence in 
support of the organization. Both formal and informal leaders make use of several 
kinds of power, including the ability to grant rewards or impose punishments, the 
possession of expert knowledge, and personal attraction or charisma. Informal 
leaders who identify with the organization’s goals are a valuable asset to any 
organization. However, a business can be brought to its knees by informal leaders 
who turn work groups against management.
Styles of Leadership
For many years, leadership was viewed as a combination 
of personality traits, such as self-confidence, concern 
for people, intelligence, and dependability. Achieving 
a consensus on which traits were most important 
was difficult, however, so attention turned to styles 
of leadership behavior. In recent years, several styles 
of leadership have emerged, including autocratic, 
participative, and entrepreneurial.
Autocratic leadership is very task-oriented. 
Decisions are made confidently, with little concern about 
employee opinions. Employees are told exactly what is 
expected from them and given specific guidelines, rules, and 
regulations on how to achieve their tasks. Managers at Hyundai 
USA successfully employ the autocratic leadership style.12
Participative leadership is common in today’s business 
organizations. Participative leaders consult workers before 
making decisions. This helps workers understand which goals 
are important and fosters a sense of ownership and commit-
ment to reach those goals. Participative leaders can be classi-
fied into three groups: consultative, consensus, and democratic. 
Consultative leaders discuss issues with workers but retain the 
final authority for decision making. Consensus leaders seek 
input from almost all workers and make final decisions based 
on their support. Democratic leaders give final authority to the 
group. They collect opinions and base their decisions on the 
vote of the group. Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey 
Brin are known for their democratic decision-making styles.13 
Communication is active upward and downward in participa-
tive organizations. Coaching, collaborating, and negotiating are 
important skills for participative leaders.

leadership.

Part 3   Management and Organization
Entrepreneurial leadership is personality dependent. Although 
each entrepreneur is different, this leadership style is generally task-
oriented, driven, charismatic, and enthusiastic.14 The entrepreneur-
ial personality tends to take initiative, venture into new areas, be 
visionary, and focus on the next deal. Their enthusiasm energizes 
and inspires their people. Entrepreneurial leaders tend to be very 
invested in their businesses, working extremely long hours trying to 
ensure the success of their firm. They may not understand why their 
employees do not have the same level of passion for their work. 
Steve Jobs, former CEO of Apple, was probably the preeminent 
example of an entrepreneurial leader. He was highly charismatic 
and worked tirelessly and passionately for his organization.15
Which Leadership Style Is the Best?
Today, most management experts agree that no “best” managerial 
leadership style exists. Each of the styles described—autocratic, 
participative, and entrepreneurial—has advantages and disadvan­
tages. Participative leadership can motivate employees to work 
effectively because they are implementing their own decisions. 
However, the decision-making process in participative leadership 
takes time that subordinates could be devoting to the work itself. 
Table 6.1 presents tips for effective leadership. Most of these tips are 
consistent with the participative leadership style.
Although hundreds of research studies have been conducted to prove which lead-
ership style is best, there are no definite conclusions. The “best” leadership seems to 
occur when the leader’s style matches the situation. Each of the leadership styles can be 
effective in the right situation. The most effective style depends on interaction among 
employees, characteristics of the work situation, and the manager’s personality.
A CEO who leads by example. Bill Gates’s 
leadership style and technological know-how have 
helped him foster an environment at Microsoft in 
which top-notch products can be created. Gates’s 
leadership style includes dimensions of both autocratic 
and participative leadership.

Managerial Decision Making
Decision making is the act of choosing one alternative from a set of alternatives.16 In 
ordinary situations, decisions are made casually and informally. We encounter a problem, 
mull it over, settle on a solution, and go on. Managers, however, require a more systematic 
method for solving complex problems. As shown in Figure 6.9, managerial decision 
making involves four steps: (1) identifying the problem or opportunity, (2) generating 
alternatives, (3) selecting an alternative, and (4) implementing and evaluating the solution.
Identifying the Problem or Opportunity
A problem is the discrepancy between an actual condition and a desired condition—the 
difference between what is occurring and what one wishes would occur. For example, 
a marketing manager at Campbell’s Soup Company has a problem if sales revenues for 
Campbell’s Hungry Man frozen dinners are declining (the actual condition). To solve 
this problem, the marketing manager must take steps to increase sales revenues (desired 
condition). Most people consider a problem to be “negative”; however, a problem also 
can be “positive.” A positive problem should be viewed as an “opportunity.”
Although accurate identification of a problem is essential before it can be solved 
or turned into an opportunity, this stage of decision making creates many difficulties 
for managers. Sometimes managers’ preconceptions of the problem prevent them from 
seeing the actual situation. They produce an answer before the proper question has 
been asked. In other cases, managers overlook truly significant issues by focusing on 
unimportant matters. Also, managers may mistakenly analyze problems in terms of 
symptoms rather than underlying causes.
Effective managers learn to look ahead so that they are prepared when decisions must 
be made. They clarify situations and examine the causes of problems, asking whether the 
presence or absence of certain variables alters a situation. Finally, they consider how 
individual behaviors and values affect the way problems or opportunities are defined.
Generating Alternatives
After a problem has been defined, the next task is to generate alternatives. The more 
important the decision, the more attention must be devoted to this stage. Managers 
should be open to fresh, innovative ideas as well as obvious answers.
Certain techniques can aid in the generation of creative alternatives. Brainstorming, 
commonly used in group discussions, encourages participants to produce many new 
ideas. During brainstorming, other group members are not permitted to criticize or 
ridicule. Another approach, developed by the U.S. Navy, is called “Blast! Then Refine.” 
Group members tackle a recurring problem by erasing all previous solutions and pro-
cedures. The group then re-evaluates its original objectives, modifies them if necessary, 
and devises new solutions. Other techniques—including trial and error—are also useful 
in this stage of decision making.
Selecting an Alternative
Final decisions are influenced by a number of considerations, including financial 
constraints, human and informational resources, time limits, legal obstacles, and political

factors. Managers must select the alternative that will be most effective and practical. 
Long known for its simple menu of fast food, McDonald’s has been forced recently 
to choose between different alternatives in order to accommodate changing consumer 
tastes. A few years ago, McDonald’s was faced with a problem of slumping sales and 
had to make decisions regarding business structure and the type of food offerings that 
would attract customers. Management outlined its alternatives selection in the “Plan 
to Win,” which involved changing the fast food chain’s menu to include more salads, 
smoothies, and other healthier items; as well as acquiring other companies, such as 
Chipotle, which offers healthy Mexican fast food. Management also implemented a 
careful leadership succession plan in order to make leadership transfers as smooth as 
possible.17
At times, two or more alternatives or some combination of alternatives will be 
equally appropriate. Managers may choose solutions to problems on several levels. The 
coined word satisfice describes solutions that are only adequate and not ideal. When 
lacking time or information, managers often make decisions that “satisfice.” Whenever 
possible, managers should try to investigate alternatives carefully and select the ideal 
solution.
Implementing and Evaluating the Solution
Implementation of a decision requires time, planning, preparation of personnel, and 
evaluation of results. Managers usually deal with unforeseen consequences even when 
they have carefully considered the alternatives.
The final step in managerial decision making entails evaluating a decision’s effec-
tiveness. If the alternative that was chosen removes the difference between the actual 
Social
Media
A growing number of firms are encouraging 
employees to interact with each other and with customers 
and suppliers using social media, as long as they follow 
specific guidelines. Kodak’s employees must disclose 
their affiliation when discussing anything related to the 
company’s business and are not allowed to reveal any 
confidential information. The social-media policy of online 
retailer Zappos is short and to 
the point: “Be real and use your 
best judgment.”

Through Social Media, Do Workers 
Create Problems for Their Employers?
How should managers handle employee use of social media? 
Despite the growing popularity of Facebook, LinkedIn, 
Twitter, and other sites, some companies are concerned 
that employees will disclose proprietary information or 
become involved in controversial 
conversations that could harm the 
company’s image. They also worry 
that employees will be distracted 
during the workday.
Employers in a few industries—
such as financial services—are 
required to monitor business-related 
messages posted by employees to 
ensure compliance with government 
regulations. In most cases, however, 
companies are free to set their own 
policies. For example, IBM’s policy 
requires employees to use respectful 
language, obey copyright laws, 
and indicate that their views are 
personal.

condition and the desired condition, the decision is considered effective. If the problem 
still exists, managers may select one of the following choices:
●
●Decide to give the chosen alternative more time to work.
●
●Adopt a different alternative.
●
●Start the problem identification process all over again.
Failure to evaluate decisions adequately may have negative consequences. After the 
recent Wall Street financial meltdown, stakeholders and regulators spent years debat-
ing what happened and how to prevent a similar financial system breakdown in the 
future. Derivatives were largely blamed for the meltdown. At the time, organizational 
management, gatekeepers, and regulators all failed to adequately assess the risks of 
using derivatives. Recently, regulators came together to approve new rules that they 
hope will reduce the likelihood of widespread derivatives problems in the future.18
Managing Total Quality
The management of quality is a high priority in some organizations today. Major 
reasons for a greater focus on quality include foreign competition, more demanding 
customers, and poor financial performance resulting from reduced market shares 
and higher costs. Over the last few years, several U.S. firms have lost the dominant 
competitive positions they had held for decades.
Total quality management is a much broader concept than just controlling the 
quality of the product itself (which is discussed in Chapter 8). Total quality manage-
ment (TQM) is the coordination of efforts directed at improving customer satisfaction, 
increasing employee participation, strengthening supplier partnerships, and facilitating 
an organizational atmosphere of continuous quality improvement. For TQM programs 
to be effective, management must address each of the following components:
●
●Customer satisfaction. Ways to improve include producing higher-quality products, 
providing better customer service, and showing customers that the company cares.
●
●Employee participation. This can be increased by allowing employees to contrib-
ute to decisions, develop self-managed work teams, and assume responsibility for 
improving the quality of their work.
●
●Strengthening supplier partnerships. Developing good working 
relationships with suppliers can ensure that the right supplies 
and materials will be delivered on time at lower costs.
●
●Continuous quality improvement. A program based on con-
tinuous improvement has proven to be the most effective long-
term approach.
One tool that is used for TQM is called benchmarking. 
Benchmarking is the process of evaluating the products, processes, 
or management practices of another organization for the purpose of 
improving quality. The focal organization may be superior in safety, 
customer service, productivity, innovativeness, or in some other way.
For example, competitors’ products might be disassembled and 
evaluated, or wage and benefit plans might be surveyed to measure 
compensation packages against the labor market. The four basic steps 
of benchmarking are identifying objectives, forming a benchmarking 
team, collecting data, analyzing data, and acting on the results. Best 
practices may be discovered in any industry or organization.
Although many factors influence the effectiveness of a TQM 
program, two issues are crucial. First, top management must 
make a strong commitment to a TQM program by treating qual-
ity improvement as a top priority and giving it frequent attention. 
Firms that establish a TQM program but then focus on other pri-
orities will find that their quality-improvement initiatives will fail.

management.

Total quality management accelerates Toyota’s 
competitiveness. Prior to the 1970s, products “Made 
in Japan” were often considered shoddy. Not anymore. 
Toyota Motor Company worked hard to change 
that image by pioneering the use of total quality 
management practices.  As a part of its total quality 
management practices, Toyota meticulously inspects its 
products and continuously strives to improve them.

Inside
Business
As Virginia Rometty rose through the ranks of IBM, she 
earned the experience and skills needed to head this pio-
neering technology company. She worked closely with 
the previous CEO on implementing the current strategic 
plan, which aims to accelerate growth of IBM’s global 
sales and profits. On her first day as CEO, she announced 
top-­management changes to support IBM’s international 
activities and its services division, two key groups impor-
tant to the company’s future.
Although IBM is more than 100 years old, its CEO 
wants it to be as innovative as a young start-up. For more 
than 15 years, IBM has been awarded more U.S. patents 
than any other company, and Rometty plans to maintain 
this technological leadership as she positions the com-
pany for aggressive growth in the years ahead.

Define what management is.
Management is the process of coordinating people and other 
resources to achieve an organization’s goals. Managers are 
concerned with four types of resources—material, human, 
financial, and informational.
Describe the four basic management functions: 
planning, organizing, leading and motivating, and 
controlling.
Managers perform four basic functions. Management functions 
do not occur according to some rigid, preset timetable, though. 
At any time, managers may engage in a number of functions 
simultaneously. However, each function tends to lead naturally 
to others. First, managers engage in planning—determining 
where the firm should be going and how best to get there. 
One method of planning that can be used is SWOT analysis, 
which identifies and evaluates a firm’s strengths, weaknesses, 
opportunities, and threats. Three types of plans, from the 
broadest to the most specific, are strategic plans, tactical plans, 
and operational plans. Managers also organize resources and 
activities to accomplish results in an efficient and effective 
manner, and they lead and motivate others to work in the best 
interests of the organization. In addition, managers control 
ongoing activities to keep the organization on course. There 
are three steps in the control function: setting standards, 
measuring actual performance, and taking corrective action.
Distinguish among the various kinds of managers 
in terms of both level and area of management.
Managers—or management positions—may be classified 
from two different perspectives. From the perspective of 
level within the organization, there are top managers, who 
control the fortunes of the organization; middle managers,

Summary
Second, management must coordinate the specific elements of a TQM program so that 
they work in harmony with each other.
Although not all U.S. companies have TQM programs, these programs provide 
many benefits. Overall financial benefits include lower operating costs, higher return 
on sales and on investments, and an improved ability to use premium pricing rather 
than competitive pricing. Firms that do not implement TQM are sometimes afraid 
that the costs of doing so will be prohibitive. While implementing TQM can be high 
initially, the savings from preventing future problems and integrating systems usually 
make up for the expense. The long-term costs of not implementing TQM can involve 
damage to a company’s reputation and lost productivity and time from fixing mistakes 
after they have happened.19

who implement strategies and major policies; and first-line 
managers, who supervise the activities of operating employees. 
From the viewpoint of area of management, managers most 
often deal with the areas of finance, operations, marketing, 
human resources, and administration.
Identify the key management skills of successful 
managers.
Managers need a variety of skills in order to run a successful 
and efficient business. Conceptual skills are used to think 
in abstract terms or see the “big picture.” Analytic skills 
are used to identify problems correctly, generate reasonable 
alternatives, and select the “best” alternatives to solve 
problems. Interpersonal skills are used to deal effectively 
with other people, both inside and outside an organization. 
Technical skills are needed to accomplish a specialized 
activity, whether they are used to actually do the task or used 
to train and assist employees. Communication skills are used 
to speak, listen, and write effectively.
Explain the different types of leadership.
Managers’ effectiveness often depends on their styles of 
leadership—that is, their ability to influence others, either 
formally or informally. Autocratic leaders are very task 
oriented; they tell their employees exactly what is expected 
from them and give them specific instructions on how to 
do their assigned tasks. Participative leaders consult their 
employees before making decisions and can be classified 
into three groups: consultative, consensus, and democratic. 
Entrepreneurial leaders are different depending on their 
personalities, but they are generally enthusiastic and 
passionate about their work and tend to take initiative.

Discuss the steps in the managerial decision-
making process.
Decision making, an integral part of a manager’s work, is the 
process of developing a set of possible alternative solutions to 
a problem and choosing one alternative from among the set. 
Managerial decision making involves four steps: Managers 
must accurately identify problems, generate several possible 
solutions, choose the solution that will be most effective 
under the circumstances, and implement and evaluate the 
chosen course of action.
Describe how organizations benefit from total 
quality management.
Total quality management (TQM) is the coordination 
of efforts directed at improving customer satisfaction, 
increasing employee participation, strengthening supplier 
partnerships, and facilitating an organizational atmosphere 
of continuous quality improvement. Another tool used 
for TQM is benchmarking, which is used to evaluate the 
products, processes, or management practices of another 
organization that is superior in some way in order to 
improve quality. The five basic steps in benchmarking 
are identifying objectives, forming a benchmarking team, 
collecting data, analyzing data, and acting on the results. 
To have an effective TQM program, top management must 
make a strong, sustained commitment to the effort and must 
be able to coordinate all the program’s elements so that 
they work in harmony. Overall financial benefits of TQM 
include lower operating costs, higher return on sales and on 
investment, and an improved ability to use premium pricing 
rather than competitive pricing.

L.L.Bean’s first product was a waterproof boot, designed by 
Maine outdoorsman Leon Leonwood Bean, who promised com-
plete customer satisfaction. One hundred pairs were sold—and 
90 pairs were returned because of a defect. Bean refunded the 
customers’ money and went to work perfecting the product, 
now one of the most popular in the firm’s long and successful 
history.
L.L.Bean began in 1912 as a tiny mail-order company and has 
grown to include 14 retail stores in ten states, an online store, 
and a popular catalog showcasing many of the company’s 20,000 
items, including high-quality clothing, accessories, outdoor gear, 
luggage, linens, and furniture. It is still privately owned and fam-
ily run and has had just three presidents in its history—L.L.Bean 
himself, his grandson Leon Gorman, and now Chris McCormick, 
the first nonfamily member to lead the firm. New England is the 
core of L.L.Bean’s market, and its selling cycle accelerates sharply 
every year around the winter holidays. Headquartered in Freeport, 
Maine, near its original store, the company reports annual sales 
of over $1.5 billion.
Managers at L.L.Bean today have many opportunities for 
using their planning, organizing, leading, and controlling skills. 
During the preholiday selling season, for instance, temporary 
workers hired to handle the increased workload bring the 
regular staff of about 4,600 to almost double its size, so 
managers have to reorganize the teams of 25 to 30 front-line 
employees who work in the call centers. Regular employees not 
currently in leadership positions are asked to head the teams 
of temps, ensuring they have an experienced person to help 
them develop their skills and perform to expectations. This 
organizing strategy works so well that many temps return year 
after year.
Planning skills come to the fore when top management decides 
when and where to open new retail stores, whether to expand 
the number of outlet stores offering discontinued items and over-
stocks, and how much to invest in ensuring that L.L.Bean build-
ings meet the highest standards of environmental stewardship. 
One recent strategic planning project resulted in the creation of a 
new clothing and accessories collection called L.L.Bean Signature, 
featuring updated versions of classic items from the company’s 
100-year heritage.
With respect to the control function, managers assess 
employee performance with a continuous evaluation process. 
Corporate-level goals are broken down to the level of the indi-
vidual store and employee. If something isn’t on track, the super-
visor is expected to let the employee know and help figure out a 
solution. However, control at L.L.Bean is not entirely a top-down 
process. Employees are encouraged to develop their own personal 
goals, such as learning a new skill or gaining a better apprecia-
tion of the way L.L.Bean makes business decisions. Managers help 
them find ways to meet these personal objectives as well, through 
a temporary reassignment within the firm or participation in a 
special company project.
L.L.Bean has a strong collaborative work culture in which it is 
equally important to work through your supervisor, your

co-workers, and your subordinates. That means everyone is 
a leader to some extent. Formal management candidates are 
asked to demonstrate both analytical and interpersonal skills 
and to model the company’s six core values: outdoor heritage, 
integrity, service, respect, perseverance, and safe and healthy 
living. In the early days of the company, L.L.Bean lived above 
the store and would come downstairs in the middle of the night 
to help a customer who rang the bell. “A customer is the most 
important person ever in this office—in person or by mail,” he 
was fond of saying. So, true to his beliefs, leadership style con-
tinues to revolve around serving the customer’s needs. As one 
L.L.Bean manager said, the company is all about salespeople 
and customer service representatives so that they can better 
serve customers.20

Case 6.2
What’s Next for “Earth’s Biggest 
Bookstore”?
© sergey rusakov/

When CEO Jeff Bezos founded the pioneering online retailer 
Amazon.com in 1995, his goal was to build “Earth’s biggest 
bookstore.” Amazon now rings up $48 billion in annual sales and 
offers “Earth’s biggest selection” of merchandise, everything from 
cameras and clothing to lamps and luggage. What began as a vir-
tual bookstore has become a multifaceted, multinational business 
serving 164 million consumers and business customers, thanks 
to the founder’s visionary leadership and relentless focus on cus-
tomer satisfaction.
	Sitting around the conference table with his top managers, 
Bezos often leaves one chair empty to represent “the most impor-
tant person in the room”—the customer. Although many CEOs 
keep a close eye on the earnings they must report to sharehold-
ers every three months, Bezos has always paid more attention to 
long-term customer needs than to short-term financial results. 
Amazon’s strategic plans look ahead a decade or more, and cover 
innovations that take advantage of the company’s technology 
strengths. “We are comfortable planting seeds and waiting for 
them to grow into trees,” he says. Bezos and his executives have 
the patience and conviction to make far-reaching decisions about 
future investments and actions, watch how things unfold during 
implementation, and adjust the plans as needed while the world 
catches up.
The Kindle is a good example of how Amazon’s strategic 
planning pays off. When electronic book readers were in their 
infancy, Bezos was convinced that Amazon could upend the mar-
ket by making an easy-to-use device capable of downloading and 
displaying any book in one minute or less. Company engineers 
invested years (and millions of dollars) inventing the original 
Kindle, which immediately sold out when introduced in 2007. 
Since then, newer models with additional features and function-
ality, including the Kindle Fire, have attracted a huge wave of 
new customers as well as new “content creators”—authors who 
use the Kindle platform to publish their own books. Electronic 
books now outsell printed books, a development that has driven 
Borders and other book stores into bankruptcy while Amazon 
profits from the surge in digital downloads that its Kindle helped 
to stimulate. 
	To ensure that Amazon is doing what it should be doing to 
satisfy customers, management sets standards for hundreds of 
everyday activities and constantly measures actual performance. 
For example, it times how quickly its web pages load and finds 
ways to speed things up, because it has learned that even a split-
second delay can cause customers to click away. The company 
maintains minimum inventory levels to avoid running out of 
merchandise, presorts packages to add to its shipping partners’ 
efficiency, and tracks down the cause of any delivery delays so cus-
tomers will know they can rely on Amazon’s delivery promises. No 
wonder Amazon routinely comes out on top in customer-satisfac-
tion surveys.
Today, the company’s Web site serves as an online market-
place where individuals and businesses can sell their products, 
paying Amazon a small percentage every time they make a sale. 
Major corporations like Netflix pay for access to Amazon’s 
sophisticated Internet software and data storage systems. Still, 
because Amazon’s roots are in retailing, Bezos continues his 
habit of reading customers’ letters to see what they like and what 
they don’t like, seeking clues that will lead him to the next big 
opportunity.21 
Questions
1.	 Knowing that Amazon.com’s strength is technology, which 
can change rapidly and unpredictably, do you agree with Jeff 
Bezos’s method of looking up to a decade ahead for strategic 
planning purposes? Explain your answer.
2.	 Does Jeff Bezos appear to be an autocratic, a participative, 
or an entrepreneurial leader? What are the implications for 
Amazon.com?
3.	 How does Amazon.com apply total quality management, and 
why?

Part 3   Management and Organization
1 	SOCIAL MEDIA EXERCISE
Crowdsourcing is a set of principles, processes, and platforms 
to get things done that includes putting out an open call to a 
group and managing the responses and output. Crowdsourcing 
can be like outsourcing in a bigger way because instead of con-
tracting to one known entity, you are putting a call out to a big-
ger group, often a global online community, to either get many 
to participate or to find the person you need by casting a much 
wider net.
There are crowdsourcing companies that perform specific 
types of work such as translations (MyGengo, Smartling), tran-
scription (CastingWords), keyword marketing (Trada), even 
design and marketing work (Prova, 99Designs, CrowdSpring). 
Each company operates differently. In the case of transcription 
or translation, you give work to a company like CastingWords or 
MyGengo, and they in turn put the job out to their “crowd” of 
workers from around the world. They are like the middleman to 
helping you get the work done, and their distributed workforce 
can be less costly to them so they pass on their savings to your 
organization.
1.	 Check out a few of these crowdsourcing companies. What are 
your thoughts? Do you think they are effective? Why or why 
not?
2.	 Which type of leadership is most likely to include the use of 
crowdsourcing?
3.	 Can you think of other areas in businesses that can benefit 
from the use of crowdsourcing? What are they?
2 	JOURNALING FOR SUCCESS
Discovery statement: This chapter discussed the critical manage-
ment function of leading and motivating others to work in the 
best interests of an organization. Think about your current job or 
a job that you had previously.
Assignment
1.	 Who is the most outstanding leader with whom you have 
worked?
2.	 What was his or her position and in what capacity did you 
work with the person?
3.	 What are this person’s outstanding leadership qualities?
4.	 Select the most outstanding leadership quality from question 
3 and provide an example that demonstrates this quality.
5.	 Do most of your co-workers view this person as being an 
­outstanding leader, too? Explain.
3 	DEVELOPING CRITICAL-THINKING SKILLS
As defined in the chapter, an organization’s mission is a state-
ment of the basic purpose that makes the organization differ-
ent from others. Clearly, a mission statement, by indicating the 
purpose of a business, directly affects the company’s employees, 
customers, and stockholders.
Assignment
1.	 Find the mission statements of three large corporations in dif-
ferent industries. The Internet is one source of mission state-
ments. For example, you might search these sites:
www.apple.com
www.benjerry.com
www.walmart.com
Compare the mission statements on the basis of what each 
reflects about the company’s philosophy and its concern for 
employees, customers, and stockholders.
2.	 Which company would you like to work for and why?
3.	 Prepare a report on your findings.
4 	BUILDING TEAM SKILLS
Over the past few years, an increasing number of employees, 
stockholders, and customers have been demanding to know what 
their companies are about. As a result, more companies have 
been taking the time to analyze their operations and to prepare 
mission statements that focus on the purpose of the company. 
The mission statement is becoming a critical planning tool for 
successful companies. To make effective decisions, employees 
must understand the purpose of their company.
Assignment
1.	 Divide into teams and write a mission statement for one of 
the following types of businesses:
Food service, restaurant
Banking
Airline
Auto repair
Cabinet manufacturing
2.	 Discuss your mission statement with other teams. How did 
the other teams interpret the purpose of your company? What 
is the mission statement saying about the company?
3.	 Write a one-page report on what you learned about develop-
ing mission statements.
5 	RESEARCHING DIFFERENT CAREERS
A successful career requires planning. Without a plan, or road-
map, you will find it very difficult, if not impossible, to reach your 
desired career destination. The first step in planning is to estab-
lish your career goal. You then must set objectives and develop 
plans for accomplishing those objectives. This kind of planning 
takes time, but it will pay off later.

This statement should encapsulate what you want to accomplish 
over the long run. It may include the type of job you want and 
the type of business or industry you want to work in. Examples 
include the following:
●
●
My career goal is to work as a top manager in the food 
industry.
●
●
My career goal is to supervise aircraft mechanics.
●
●
My career goal is to win the top achievement award in the 
advertising industry.

Objectives are benchmarks along the route to a career des-
tination. They are more specific than a career goal. A statement 
about a career objective should specify what you want to accom-
plish, when you will complete it, and any other details that will 
serve as criteria against which you can measure your progress. 
Examples include the following:
●
●
My objective is to enroll in a management course at Main 
College in the spring semester 2014.
●
●
My objective is to earn an A in the management course at 
Main College in the spring semester 2014.
●
●
My objective is to be promoted to supervisor by January 1, 
2016.
●
●
My objective is to prepare a status report by September 
30 covering the last quarter’s activities by asking Charlie in 
Quality Control to teach me the procedures.
3.	 Exchange your goal and objectives statements with another 
class member. Can your partner interpret your objectives 
correctly? Are the objectives concise and complete? Do they 
include criteria against which you can measure your progress? 
If not, discuss the problem and rewrite the objective.

Crafting a Split of Snacks and Groceries at Kraft
Over the past 25 years, Kraft Foods has altered its organizational structure again and 
again as it changed ownership, acquired new brands and companies, and continued to 
expand internationally. With future growth on their minds, senior managers decided to 
split Kraft into two separate companies by the end of 2012. The spinoff company with 
North American grocery brands such as Maxwell House, Velveeta, and Oscar Meyer has 
$16 billion in annual sales. The spinoff with global snack brands such as Cadbury, Oreo, 
and Trident has $32 billion in annual sales and is growing quickly because of increasing 
demand in emerging markets like China.
After the spinoffs were announced, Kraft Foods CEO Irene Rosenfeld was named CEO 
of the global snacks company, and Tony Vernon, executive vice president of Kraft Foods, 
was named CEO of the grocery company. In both firms, jobs are grouped by geographic 
region and then by country, as well as by type of customer (such as supermarket chains 
and convenience stores). This organization, carried over from the former parent, allows 
executives to understand and address each area’s specific needs.
For example, when Kraft first introduced U.S.-style Oreo cookies in China, sales were 
not spectacular. Then local management sweetened the recipe for Chinese tastes, added 
a straw shape for neater dunking, and created locally-inspired flavors such as green tea 
filling. Soon Oreo was the top-selling cookie in China. The same intense focus on local 
needs helped Kraft’s Latin American group research and introduce Delice, a new chocolate 
product, under the locally strong Lacta brand. Thanks to that new product, the brand’s 
yearly sales skyrocketed by 29 percent.
Each of the spinoffs needed its own staff for functions such as human resources man-
agement and financial management. They also had to determine how to handle tasks such 
as distributing products to retail customers. The snacks side decided to deliver its products 
directly to each retail store, while the grocery side chose to stock products in warehouses 
and hire outside firms to make deliveries to retail customers. Decisions like these ultimately 
affected the number and types of jobs in each spinoff. What’s next for these two companies?1
Inside
Business
FYI
Did You Know? 
Combined, the two Kraft Foods 
companies have more than 
120,000 employees and ring 
up more than $48 billion in 
annual sales worldwide.
T
o survive and to grow, companies such as Kraft Foods must constantly look for 
ways to improve their methods of doing business. Managers at Kraft, like those 
at many other organizations, deliberately reorganized the company to achieve 
its goals and to create satisfying products that foster long-term customer relationships.
When firms are organized, or reorganized, the focus is sometimes on achieving low 
operating costs. Other firms, such as Nike, emphasize providing high-quality products 
to ensure customer satisfaction. A firm’s organization influences its performance. Thus, 
the issue of organization is important.
We begin this chapter by examining the business organization—what it is and how 
it functions in today’s business environment. Next, we focus one by one on five char-
acteristics that shape an organization’s structure. We discuss job specialization within a 
company, the grouping of jobs into manageable units or departments, the delegation of 
power from management to workers, the span of management, and establishment of a 
chain of command. Then we step back for an overall view of organizational structure, 
describe the effects of corporate culture, and focus in on how committees and task 
forces are used. Finally, we look at the network of social interactions—the informal 
organization—that operates within the formal business structure.

What Is an Organization?
We used the term organization throughout Chapter 6 without really defining it mainly 
because its everyday meaning is close to its business meaning. Here, however, let us 
agree that an organization is a group of two or more people working together to 
achieve a common set of goals. A neighborhood dry cleaner owned and operated by 
a husband-and-wife team is an organization. IBM and Home Depot, which employ 
thousands of workers worldwide, are also organizations in the same sense. Although 
each corporation’s organizational structure is more complex than the dry-cleaning 
establishment, all must be organized to achieve their goals.
An inventor who goes into business to produce and market a new invention hires 
people, decides what each will do, determines who will report to whom, and so on. 
These activities are the essence of organizing, or creating, the organization. One way 
to create this “picture” is to create an organization chart.
Developing Organization Charts
An organization chart is a diagram that represents the positions and relationships 
within an organization. An example of an organization chart is shown in Figure 7.1. 
Each rectangle represents a particular position or person in the organization. At the top is 
the president, at the next level are the vice presidents. The solid vertical lines connecting

the vice presidents to the president indicate that the vice presidents are in the chain of 
command. The chain of command is the line of authority that extends from the highest 
to the lowest levels of the organization. Moreover, each vice president reports directly 
to the president. Similarly, the plant managers, regional sales managers, and accounting 
department manager report to the vice presidents. The chain of command can be short 
or long. A small local restaurant may have a very short chain of command consisting 
of the owner at the top and employees below. Large multinational corporations, on 
the other hand, may have very long chains of command. No matter what the length 
of the chain of command, organizations must make certain that communication along 
the chain is clear. In the chart, the connections to the directors of legal services, public 
affairs, and human resources are shown as broken lines; these people are not part of the 
direct chain of command. Instead, they hold advisory, or staff, positions. This difference 
will be examined later in this chapter when we discuss line-and-staff positions.
Most smaller organizations find organization charts useful. They clarify positions 
and report relationships for everyone in the organization, and they help managers to 
track growth and change in the organizational structure. However, many large organi-
zations, such as ExxonMobil, Kellogg’s, and Procter & Gamble, do not maintain com-
plete, detailed charts. There are two reasons for this. First, it is difficult to chart even a 
few dozen positions accurately, much less the thousands that characterize larger firms. 
Second, larger organizations are almost always changing parts of their structure. An 
organization chart would be outdated before it was completed. However, organizations A

Major Considerations for Organizing a Business
When a firm is started, management must decide how to organize the firm. These 
decisions focus on job design, departmentalization, delegation, span of management, 
and chain of command. In the next several sections, we discuss major issues associated 
with these dimensions.
Job Design
In Chapter 1, we defined specialization as the separation of a manufacturing process 
into distinct tasks and the assignment of different tasks to different people. Here we are 
extending that concept to all the activities performed within an organization.
Job Specialization
Job specialization is the separation of all organizational activities into distinct tasks 
and the assignment of different tasks to different people. Adam Smith, the 18th-century 
economist whose theories gave rise to capitalism, was the first to emphasize the 
power of specialization in his book, The Wealth of Nations. According to Smith, the 
various tasks in a particular pin factory were arranged so that one worker 
drew the wire for the pins, another straightened the wire, a third cut it, a 
fourth ground the point, and a fifth attached the head. Smith claimed that 
10 men were able to produce 48,000 pins per day. Before specialization, they 
could produce only 200 pins per day because each worker had to perform 
all five tasks!
The Rationale for Specialization
For a number of reasons, some job specialization is necessary in every 
organization because the “job” of most organizations is too large for one 
person to handle. In a firm such as Ford Motor Company, thousands of 
people are needed to manufacture automobiles. Others are needed to sell the 
cars, control the firm’s finances, and so on.
Second, when a worker has to learn one specific, highly specialized task, 
that individual should be able to learn it very efficiently. Third, a worker 
repeating the same job does not lose time changing from operations, as the 
pin workers did when producing complete pins. Fourth, the more specialized 
the job, the easier it is to design specialized equipment. And finally, the more 
specialized the job, the easier the job training.
Alternatives to Job Specialization
Unfortunately, specialization can have negative consequences as well. The 
most significant drawback is the boredom and dissatisfaction employees may 
feel when repeating the same job. Bored employees may be absent from work 
frequently, may not put much effort into their work, and may even sabotage 
the company’s efforts to produce quality products.
To combat these problems, managers often turn to job rotation. Job 
­rotation is the systematic shifting of employees from one job to another. For 
example, a worker may be assigned a different job every week for a four-
week period and then return to the first job in the fifth week. Job rotation 
provides a variety of tasks so that workers are less likely to become bored 
and dissatisfied. Intel, for instance, offers an internal database of short-term 
assignments for employees. Job rotation helps workers stay interested in their 
jobs, develop new skills, and identify new roles where they may like to focus

Specialization has its drawbacks. This 
employee has a specialized job that includes 
cutting out leather components that will be 
used to produce handbags. Specialization 
is efficient for the firm, but it can leave 
employees bored and dissatisfied. What 
do you think a firm can do to offset these 
problems?

survey, 43% of firms offer some sort of cross-training for workers.2
Two other approaches—job enlargement and job enrichment—also can provide 
solutions to the problems caused by job specialization. These topics, along with other 
methods used to motivate employees, are discussed in Chapter 10.
Departmentalization
After jobs are designed, they must be grouped together into “working units,” 
or departments. This process is called departmentalization. More specifically, 
departmentalization is the process of grouping jobs into manageable units. Several 
departmentalization bases are used commonly. In fact, most firms use more than one. 
Today, the most common bases for organizing a business into effective departments are 
by function, by product, by location, and by customer.
By Function
Departmentalization by function groups jobs that relate to the same organizational 
activity. Under this scheme, all marketing personnel are grouped together in the 
marketing department, all production personnel in the production department, and 
so on.
Most smaller and newer organizations departmentalize by function. Supervision is 
simplified because everyone is involved in the same activities, and coordination is easy. 
The disadvantages of this method of grouping jobs are that it can lead to slow decision 
making and that it tends to emphasize the department over the whole organization.
By Product
Departmentalization by product groups activities related to a particular good or 
service. This approach is used often by older and larger firms that produce and sell a 
variety of products. Each department handles its own marketing, production, financial 
management, and human resources activities.
Departmentalization by product makes decision making easier and provides 
for the integration of all activities associated with each product. 
However, it causes some duplication of specialized activities—
such as finance—from department to department. Moreover, 
the emphasis is placed on the product rather than on the whole 
organization.
By Location
Departmentalization by location groups activities according 
to the defined geographic area in which they are performed. 
Departmental areas may range from whole countries (for 
international firms) to regions within countries (for national firms) 
to areas of several city blocks (for police departments organized into 
precincts). Departmentalization by location allows the organization 
to respond readily to the unique demands or requirements of 
different locations. Nevertheless, a large administrative staff and an 
elaborate control system may be needed to coordinate operations 
in many locations.
By Customer
Departmentalization by customer groups activities according 
to the needs of various customer populations. A local Chevrolet 
dealership, for example, may have one sales staff to deal with 
individual consumers and a different sales staff to work with

departmentalization.

How is your school organized? These call center 
employees are organized by their function. Some 
businesses are organized by more than their functions, 
though. For example, if your university has more than 
one campus, they are organized by location but also 
by function such as by their business, social sciences, 
and math departments. Your school also might be 
organized by customer such as by undergraduate, 
graduate, and continuing education students.

corporate fleet buyers. The obvious advantage of this approach is that it allows the firm 
to deal efficiently with unique customers or customer groups. The biggest drawback is 
that a larger-than-usual administrative staff is needed.
Combinations of Bases
Many organizations use more than one of these departmentalization bases. PepsiCo, for 
instance, is divided by product and location. It has product divisions such as Beverages, 
Frito-Lay, Quaker, and Latin American Foods, as well as divisions based on location 
such as Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.3
Take a moment to examine Figure 7.2. Notice that departmentalization by cus-
tomer is used to organize New-Wave Fashions, Inc., into three major divisions: men’s, 
women’s, and children’s clothing. Then functional departmentalization is used to dis-
tinguish the firm’s production and marketing activities. Finally, location is used to 
organize the firm’s marketing efforts.
Delegation, Decentralization,  
and Centralization
The third major step in the organizing process is to distribute power in the organization. 
Delegation assigns part of a manager’s work and power to other workers. The degree 
of centralization or decentralization of authority is determined by the overall pattern 
of delegation within the organization.
Delegation of Authority
Because no manager can do everything, delegation is vital to completion of a manager’s 
work. Delegation is also important in developing the skills and abilities of subordinates. 
It allows those who are being groomed for higher-level positions to play increasingly 
important roles in decision making.

follows from delegation.
Most firms use more than one basis for departmentalization

responsibility the duty to do a 
job or perform a task
authority the power, within an 
organization, to accomplish an 
assigned job or task
accountability the obligation 
of a worker to accomplish an 
assigned job or task 
decentralized organization 
an organization in which 
management consciously attempts 
to spread authority widely in the 
lower levels of the organization
Steps in Delegation  The delegation process generally involves three steps (see 
Figure 7.3). First, the manager must assign responsibility. Responsibility is the duty to 
do a job or perform a task. In most job settings, a manager simply gives the worker a 
job to do. Typical job assignments might range from having a worker prepare a report 
on the status of a new quality control program to placing the person in charge of a 
task force. Second, the manager must grant authority. Authority is the power, within 
the organization, to accomplish an assigned job or task. This might include the power 
to obtain specific information, order supplies, authorize relevant expenditures, or make 
certain decisions. Finally, the manager must create accountability. Accountability is 
the obligation of a worker to accomplish an assigned job or task.
Note that accountability is created, but it cannot be delegated. Suppose that you 
are an operations manager for Target and are responsible for performing a specific task. 
You, in turn, delegate this task to someone else. You nonetheless remain accountable to 
your immediate supervisor for getting the task done properly. If the 
other person fails to complete the assignment, you—not the person 
to whom you delegated the task—will be held accountable.
Barriers to Delegation  For several reasons, managers may be 
unwilling to delegate work. Many managers are reluctant to del-
egate because they want to be sure that the work gets done. Another 
reason for reluctance stems from the opposite situation. The man-
ager fears that the worker will do the work well and attract the 
approving notice of higher-level managers. Finally, some managers 
do not delegate because they are so disorganized that they simply 
are not able to plan and assign work effectively.
Decentralization of Authority
The pattern of delegation throughout an organization determines the 
extent to which that organization is decentralized or centralized. In 
a decentralized organization, management consciously attempts 
to spread authority widely across various organization levels. A 
Delegate, delegate, delegate. The industrialist 
Andrew Carnegie once said, “No person will make a 
great business who wants to do it all himself or get all 
the credit.” Delegating gives employees different tasks 
to do, which can enrich and enlarge their jobs. It also 
enables both employees and their superiors to learn 
new skills required for higher-level positions.

Restructuring to nurture innovation doesn’t guarantee 
a product hit, as Dell knows from its unsuccessful first 
experience with a separate smartphone division. Still, 
decentralization is giving Dell an opportunity to recapture the 
nimble, innovative spirit of its early days.

Dell Restructures to Jump-Start Innovation
With more than $60 billion in global revenue 
from computers, cloud computing, and other 
high-tech offerings, Dell is hardly a scrappy 
startup. To recapture market share and create the 
hot new products of tomorrow, the Texas-based company 
is decentralizing to encourage speedier innovation. As an 
example, it maintains a separate research-and-development 
group in Silicon Valley to identify, develop, and market new 
offerings in networking and other technologies.
As another example, one of Dell’s business units—located 
just eight miles from headquarters—comes up with its own 
designs for data storage centers. The business acts like a firm 
founded in somebody’s garage, rather than one of many units 
in a multinational corporation’s portfolio. In fact, one of its 
engineers actually built a piece of equipment in his garage

organization that systematically

span of management (or span 
of control) the number of workers 
who report directly to one manager
centralized organization, on the other hand, systematically works to concentrate 
authority at the upper levels. For example, many publishers of college-level textbooks are 
centralized organizations, with authority concentrated at the top. Large organizations 
may have characteristics of both decentralized and centralized organizations.
A number of factors can influence the extent to which a firm is decentralized. 
One is the external environment in which the firm operates. The more complex and 
unpredictable this environment, the more likely it is that top management will let 
lower-level managers make important decisions. After all, lower-level managers are 
closer to the problems. Another factor is the nature of the decision itself. The riskier or 
more important the decision, the greater is the tendency to centralize decision making. 
A third factor is the abilities of lower-level managers. If these managers do not have 
strong decision-making skills, top managers will be reluctant to decentralize. And, in 
contrast, strong lower-level decision-making skills encourage decentralization. Finally, 
a firm that traditionally has practiced centralization or decentralization is likely to 
maintain that posture in the future.
In principle, neither decentralization nor centralization is right or wrong. What 
works for one organization may or may not work for another. Kmart Corporation 
and McDonald’s are very successful—and both practice centralization. But decentral-
ization has worked very well for General Electric and Sears. Every organization must 
assess its own situation and then choose the level of centralization or decentralization 
that will work best.
The Span of Management
The fourth major step in organizing a business is establishing the span of 
management (or span of control), which is the number of workers who report 
directly to one manager. For hundreds of years, theorists have searched for an ideal 
span of management. When it became apparent that there is no perfect number of 
subordinates for a manager to supervise, they turned their attention to the general 
issue of whether the span should be wide or narrow. This issue is complicated because 
the span of management may change by department within the same organization. 
A highly mechanized factory where all operations are standardized may allow for a 
fairly wide span of management. An advertising agency, where new problems and 
opportunities arise every day and where teamwork is a constant necessity, will have a 
much narrower span of management.

organizational height the 
number of layers, or levels, of 
management in a firm 
Wide and Narrow Spans of Management
A wide span of management exists when a manager has a larger 
number of subordinates. A narrow span exists when the manager 
has only a few subordinates. Several factors determine the span 
that is better for a particular manager (see Figure 7.4). Generally, 
the span of control may be wide when (1) the manager and the 
subordinates are very competent, (2) the organization has a well-
established set of standard operating procedures, and (3) few new 
problems are expected to arise. The span should be narrow when 
(1) workers are physically located far from one another, (2) the 
manager has much work to do in addition to supervising workers, 
(3) a great deal of interaction is required between supervisor and 
workers, and (4) new problems arise frequently.
Organizational Height
The span of management has an obvious impact on relations between 
managers and workers. It has a more subtle but equally important 
impact on the height of the organization. Organizational height 
is the number of layers, or levels, of management in a firm. The 
span of management plays a direct role in determining the height 
of the organization (see Figure 7.4). If spans of management are wider, fewer levels 
are needed, and the organization is flat. If spans of management generally are narrow, 
more levels are needed, and the resulting organization is tall.
In a taller organization, administrative costs are higher because more managers 
are needed. Communication among levels may become distorted because information 
has to pass up and down through more people. When companies are cutting costs, one 
option is to decrease organizational height in order to reduce related administrative 
expenses. For example, when cosmetics provider Avon experienced declining sales, the 
company began a series of long and extensive restructuring programs. The programs 
focused on increasing efficiency and organizational effectiveness. The restructuring 
Narrow versus wide spans of management: 
Which is better? The manager on the right side of

Consequently, he has a narrow span of management.

number of employees their supervisors should manage.

Several criteria determine whether a firm uses a wide span of management,  
in which a number of workers report to one manager, or a narrow span, in which  
a manager supervises only a few workers.

ers may perform more administrative duties simply because there are fewer managers. 
Wide spans of management also may require managers to spend considerably more 
time supervising and working with subordinates.
Forms of Organizational Structure
Up to this point, we have focused our attention on the major characteristics of 
organizational structure. In many ways, this is like discussing the parts of a jigsaw 
puzzle one by one. It is now time to put the puzzle together. In particular, we discuss 
four basic forms of organizational structure: line, line-and-staff, matrix, and network.
The Line Structure
The simplest and oldest form of organizational structure is the line structure, in which 
the chain of command goes directly from person to person throughout the organization. 
Thus, a straight line could be drawn down through the levels of management, from the 
chief executive down to the lowest level in the organization. In a small retail store, for 
example, an hourly employee might report to an assistant manager, who reports to a 
store manager, who reports to the owner.
Managers within a line structure, called line managers, make decisions and 
give orders to subordinates to achieve the organization’s goals. A line structure’s 
simplicity and clear chain of command allow line managers to make decisions 
quickly with direct accountability because the decision-maker only has one supervi-
sor to report to.
The downside of a line structure, however, is that line managers are responsible 
for many activities, and therefore must have a wide range of knowledge about all of 
them. While this may not be a problem for small organizations with a lower volume of 
activities, in a larger organization, activities become more numerous and complex, thus 
making it more difficult for line managers to fully understand what they are in charge 
of. Therefore, line managers in a larger organization would have a hard time making 
an educated decision without expert advice from outside 
sources. As a result, line structures are not very effec-
tive in medium- or large-sized organizations, but are 
very popular in small organizations.
The Line-and-Staff Structure
A line-and-staff structure not only utilizes the chain 
of command from a line structure but also provides 
line managers with specialists, called staff managers. 
Therefore, this structure works much better for 
medium- and large-sized organizations than line management 
alone. Staff managers provide support, advice, and expertise 
to line managers, thus eliminating the previous drawback of 
line structures. Staff managers are not part of the chain of 
command like line managers are, but they do have authority 
over their assistants (see Figure 7.5).
Both line and staff managers are needed for effective man-
agement, but the two positions differ in important ways. The 
basic difference is in terms of authority. Line managers have 
line authority, which means that they can make decisions and 
issue directives relating to the organization’s goals. Staff man-
agers seldom have this kind of authority. Instead, they usually 
have either advisory authority or functional authority. Advisory

If you’re looking to move up, try to get some advice from 
co-workers in both line and staff positions. Not only will 
this broaden your understanding of the organization, it 
will also help you bridge the gaps between line and staff 
and connect with both groups.

matrix structure  an 
organizational structure that 
combines vertical and horizontal 
lines of authority, usually 
by superimposing product 
departmentalization on a 
functionally departmentalized 
organization
authority is the expectation that line managers will consult the appropriate staff man-
ager when making decisions. Functional authority is stronger. Functional authority is 
the authority of staff managers to make decisions and issue directives about their areas 
of expertise. For example, a legal adviser for Nike can decide whether to retain a par-
ticular clause in a contract but not product pricing.
Staff managers in a line-and-staff structure tend to have more access to informa-
tion than line managers. This means that line managers must rely on the staff managers 
for information. This is usually not an issue, unless the staff man-
ager makes a wrong decision and there is no one else to catch his or 
her mistake.5 For a variety of reasons, conflict between line manag-
ers and staff managers is fairly common in business. Staff manag-
ers often have more formal education and sometimes are younger 
(and perhaps more ambitious) than line managers. Line managers 
may perceive staff managers as a threat to their own authority and 
thus may resent them. For their part, staff managers may become 
annoyed or angry if their expert recommendations—for example, in 
public relations or human resources management—are not adopted 
by line management.
Fortunately, there are several ways to minimize the likelihood 
of such conflict. One way is to integrate line and staff managers 
into one team. Another is to ensure that the areas of responsibil-
ity of line and staff managers are clearly defined. Finally, line and 
staff managers both can be held accountable for the results of their 
activities.
The Matrix Structure
When the matrix structure is used, individuals report to more than 
one superior at the same time. The matrix structure combines 
Line-and-staff organization structure. Ronald 
McDonald occupies a staff position and does not have 
direct authority over other employees at McDonald’s. 
The other individuals shown here occupy line positions 
and do have direct authority over some of the other 
McDonald’s employees.

Since information flows are more complicated in a matrix structure, many organi-
zations choose to utilize software and technologies to help them manage information. 
For instance, Aqayo, a leading producer of recruiting and talent management software 
and programs, offers features especially for organizations utilizing a matrix structure.
Another example of a matrix organization could be an automobile manufacturer 
whose company is divided into functional departments, such as production, sales, mar-
keting, distribution, and accounting, which co-manage with product departments (the 
vehicle models).
To understand the structure of a matrix organization, consider the usual functional 
arrangement, with people working in departments such as engineering, finance, and 
marketing. Now suppose that we assign people from these departments to a special 
group that is working on a new project as a team—a cross-functional team. A cross-
functional team consists of individuals with varying specialties, expertise, and skills 
that are brought together to achieve a common task. Frequently, cross-functional teams 
are charged with the responsibility of developing new products. The manager in charge 
of a team is usually called a project manager. Any individual who is working with the 
team reports to both the project manager and the individual’s superior in the functional 
department (see Figure 7.6).
Cross-functional team projects may be temporary, in which case the team is dis-
banded once the mission is accomplished, or they may be permanent. GE employs a 
A matrix is usually the result of combining product departmentalization  
with function departmentalization. It is a complex structure  
in which employees have more than one supervisor.

functions are contracted out to

rituals, heroes, and values of a firm
permanent cross-functional team within its Appliances division, called the Lean Big 
Room, which works to identify and remove wastefulness from its production pro-
cesses, while developing exciting new products for the market.6
These teams often are empowered to make major decisions. When a cross-­
functional team is employed, prospective team members may receive special training 
because effective teamwork can require different skills. For cross-functional teams to 
be successful, team members must be given specific information on the job each per-
forms. The team also must develop a sense of cohesiveness and maintain good com-
munications among its members.
Matrix structures offer advantages over other organizational forms. Added flex-
ibility is probably the most obvious advantage. The matrix structure also can increase 
productivity, raise morale, and nurture creativity and innovation. In addition, employ-
ees experience personal development through doing a variety of jobs.
The matrix structure also has disadvantages. Having employees report to more 
than one supervisor can cause confusion about who is in charge. Like committees, 
teams may take longer to resolve problems and issues than individuals working alone. 
Other difficulties include personality clashes, poor communication, undefined indi-
vidual roles, unclear responsibilities, and finding ways to reward individual and team 
performance simultaneously. Because more managers and support staff may be needed, 
a matrix structure may be more expensive to maintain.
The Network Structure
In a network structure (sometimes called a virtual organization), administration is 
the primary function performed, and other functions such as engineering, production, 
marketing, and finance are contracted out to other organizations. Frequently, a network 
organization does not manufacture the products it sells. This type of organization 
has a few permanent employees consisting of top management and hourly clerical 
workers. Leased facilities and equipment, as well as temporary workers, are increased 
or decreased as the organization’s needs change. Thus, there is rather limited formal 
structure associated with a network organization.
An obvious strength of a network structure is flexibility that allows the orga-
nization to adjust quickly to changes. Network structures consist of a lot of teams 
working together, rather than relying on one centralized leader. This also means 
that network structures may be more likely to survive if an important leader or 
member leaves because there is no power vacuum left at the top.7 Some of the 
challenges faced by managers in network-structured organizations include control-
ling the quality of work performed by other organizations, low morale and high 
turnover among hourly workers, and the vulnerability associated with relying on 
outside contractors.
Corporate Culture
Most managers function within a corporate culture. A corporate culture is generally 
defined as the inner rites, rituals, heroes, and values of a firm. An organization’s culture 
has a powerful influence on how employees think and act. It also can determine public 
perception of the organization.
Corporate culture generally is thought to have a very strong influence on a 
firm’s performance over time. Hence, it is useful to be able to assess a firm’s cor-
porate culture. Common indicators include the physical setting (building or office 
layouts), what the company says about its corporate culture (in advertising or news 
releases), how the company greets guests (formal or informal reception areas), 
and how employees spend their time (working alone in an office or working with 
others).

corporate culture.

Part 3   Management and Organization
Goffee and Jones have identified four distinct types of corporate cultures (see Figure 7.7).  
One is called the networked culture, characterized by a base of trust and friendship 
among employees, a strong commitment to the organization, and an informal 
environment. A small nonprofit organization may seek to build a networked culture 
where employees look out for each other and believe strongly in the organizational 
mission. Building a networked culture in such an organization is important because 
employees may have to work long hours for little pay, and a strong sense of community 
and commitment helps to keep productivity high and turnover low.
The mercenary culture embodies the feelings of passion, energy, sense of pur-
pose, and excitement for one’s work. Large banks and investment firms often have 
mercenary cultures because the environment is fast-paced, the 
stakes are high, and winning is important. Ever since the Wall 
Street failures in 2008, many stakeholders internal and external 
to firms have been calling on the major players of the financial 
industry to change their excessively mercenary corporate cul-
tures. This kind of culture can be very stressful for an employee 
with an incompatible personality.8 The term mercenary does 
not imply that employees are motivated to work only for the 
money, but this is part of it. In this culture, employees are very 
intense, focused, and determined to win. In the fragmented cul-
ture, employees do not become friends, and they work “at” the 
organization, not “for” it. Employees have a high degree of 
autonomy, flexibility, and equality. The communal culture com-
bines the positive traits of the networked culture and the mer-
cenary culture—those of friendship, commitment, high focus on 
performance, and high energy. People’s lives revolve around the 
product in this culture, and success by anyone in the organiza-
tion is celebrated by all.9
Some experts believe that cultural change is needed when 
a company’s environment changes, when the industry becomes 
more competitive, the company’s performance is mediocre, and 
when the company is growing or is about to become a truly large

organization. An example of a company that some 
believe is due for a culture change is the investment 
giant Goldman Sachs. The organization was placed 
under scrutiny when a manager at its London office 
wrote a scathing op-ed piece for The New York Times, 
calling out its highly negative corporate culture.10
Organizations in the future will look quite different. 
Experts predict that tomorrow’s businesses will comprise 
small, task-oriented work groups, each with control over 
its own activities. These small groups will be coordi-
nated through an elaborate computer network and held 
together by a strong corporate culture. Businesses oper-
ating in fast-changing industries will require leadership 
that supports trust and risk taking. Creating a culture of 
trust in an organization can lead to increases in growth, 
profit, productivity, and job satisfaction. A culture of 
trust can retain the best people, inspire customer loyalty, 
develop new markets, and increase creativity.
Another area where corporate culture plays a vital 
role is the integration of two or more companies. Business 
leaders often cite the role of corporate cultures in the inte-
gration process as one of the primary factors affecting the 
success of a merger or acquisition. Experts note that cor-
porate culture is a way of conducting business both within 
the company and externally. If two merging companies do 
not address differences in corporate culture, they are set-
ting themselves up for missed expectations and possibly 
failure.

Take the “R” For Tomorrow
P&G clearly communicates sustainability as part 
of its corporate culture. Employees are sent a 
clear message to focus on sustainability both at 
work and at home. The program entitled “Take the 
R for Tomorrow” encourages responsibility (R) when it 
comes to making decisions that impact the environment. 
Employees are reminded at meetings to build sustainability 
into everyday decisions. The company vision includes goals 
for packaging, eliminating consumer and manufacturing 
waste, and resource conservation by 2020.

Internships—Who Benefits?
Are businesses and nonprofits recruiting 
college students and recent graduates for 
low-paying or unpaid internships instead of 
hiring and paying employees? How do interns 
benefit from these internships?
According to estimates, as many as three out of four 
college graduates have been interns during their 21st-century 
college careers. Through internships, students gain real-world 
experience and polish their skills to shine in today’s highly 
competitive job market. In some cases, internships carry 
college credit, another plus. Many, however, are unpaid or 
pay a small amount that barely covers commuting costs.
“They’re giving me a ton of experience and a ton of 
responsibility, so I’m happy to have that,” says one recent grad 
who interns with a nonprofit group. “But at the same time, it’s 
really frustrating to not get paid for your work.”
The U.S. Department of Labor says that unpaid internships 
are legal if they meet specific guidelines. For example, interns 
must benefit from the internship, and must receive training 
similar to what they would receive in an educational setting. 
The intern is not supposed to displace an employee or be 
entitled to a job after the internship ends. Finally, the employer 
should not gain an “immediate advantage” from the intern’s 
work—meaning the intern should be the one to benefit, not the 
employer.

Committees and Task Forces
Today, business firms use several types of committees that affect organizational 
structure. An ad hoc committee is created for a specific short-term purpose, such 
as reviewing the firm’s employee benefits plan. Once its work is finished, the ad hoc 
committee disbands. A standing committee is a relatively permanent committee 
charged with performing a recurring task. A firm might establish a budget review 
committee, for example, to review departmental budget requests on an ongoing basis. 
Finally, a task force is a committee established to investigate a major problem or 
pending decision. A firm contemplating a merger with another company might form 
a task force to assess the pros and cons of the merger.
Committees offer some advantages over individual action. Their several members 
are able to bring information and knowledge to the task at hand. Furthermore, com-
mittees tend to make more accurate decisions and to transmit their results through 
the organization more effectively. However, committee deliberations take longer than 
individual actions. In addition, unnecessary compromise may take place within the 
committee, or the opposite may occur, as one person dominates (and thus negates) the 
committee process.
The Informal Organization 
and the Grapevine
So far, we have discussed the organization as a formal structure consisting of interrelated 
positions. This is the organization that is shown on an organization chart. There is 
another kind of organization, however, that does not show up on any chart. We define 
this informal organization as the pattern of behavior and interaction that stems from 
personal rather than official relationships. Firmly embedded within every informal 
organization are informal groups and the notorious grapevine.
An informal group is created by the group members themselves to accomplish 
goals that may or may not be relevant to the organization. Workers may create an 
informal group to go bowling, form a union, get a particular manager fired or trans-
ferred, or meet for lunch. The group may last for several 
years or a few hours.
Informal groups can be powerful forces in orga-
nizations. They can restrict output, or they can help 
managers through tight spots. They can cause dis-
agreement and conflict, or they can help to boost 
morale and job satisfaction. They can show new 
people how to contribute to the organization, or they 
can help people to get away with substandard perfor-
mance. Clearly, managers should be aware of these 
informal groups. Those who make the mistake of fighting 
the informal organization have a major obstacle to overcome.
The grapevine is the informal communications network 
within an organization. It is completely separate from—and 
sometimes much faster than—the organization’s formal chan-
nels of communication. Formal communications usually fol-
low a path that parallels the organizational chain of command. 
Information can be transmitted through the grapevine in any 
direction—up, down, diagonally, or horizontally across the 
organizational structure. Subordinates may pass information 
to their bosses, an executive may relay something to a main-
tenance worker, or there may be an exchange of information 
between people who work in totally unrelated departments.

Grapevine information may be concerned with topics ranging from 
the latest management decisions to gossip.
How should managers treat the grapevine? Certainly, it would 
be a mistake to try to eliminate it. People working together, day in 
and day out, are going to communicate. A more rational approach 
is to recognize its existence. For example, managers should respond 
promptly and aggressively to inaccurate grapevine informa-
tion to minimize the damage that such misinformation might do. 
Moreover, the grapevine can come in handy when managers are on 
the receiving end of important communications from the informal 
organization.
In the next chapter, we apply these and other management con-
cepts to an extremely important business function: the production 
of goods and services.
There is power in numbers. It’s common for 
employees to befriend one another and form informal 
groups within an organization. The groups provide their 
members with camaraderie and information but can 
create both challenges and benefits for the organization.

Inside
Business
When Kraft Foods announced it was splitting into two 
companies, the grapevine buzzed for months over who 
would wind up in which positions on the new organization 
charts. Little by little, announcements filled in the blanks, 
with senior managers from the parent predecessor firm 
taking the top spots in each spinoff. About 1,600 jobs 
were cut as each side consolidated offices and stream-
lined its structure.
Kraft needed more than a year to plan the split, 
because of the complexity of separating the two compa-
nies’ operations and getting each business ready to stand 
on its own. To ease the transition, the company created 
a high-level management group to resolve issues related 
to the structural changes. Even during the reorganiza-
tion period, sales were up—especially outside the United 
States—giving the two spinoffs momentum as they left 
their former parent, Kraft Foods.
Questions
1.	 Would you expect the two spinoffs to be flatter or 
taller, compared with the structure of Kraft Foods 
before the split? Why?
2.	 The structure of the two spinoffs is geared toward 
location, for responsiveness to local needs. How can 
each of the spinoffs use this structure as a global 
strength, not just a local strength?

Understand what an organization is and identify 
its characteristics.
An organization is a group of two or more people working 
together to achieve a common set of goals. The relationships 
among positions within an organization can be illustrated by 
means of an organization chart. Five specific characteristics—
job design, departmentalization, delegation, span of 
management, and chain of command—help to determine what 
an organization chart and the organization itself look like.
Explain why job specialization is important.
Job specialization is the separation of all the activities within 
an organization into smaller components and the assignment 
of those different components to different people. Several

Part 3   Management and Organization
factors combine to make specialization a useful technique 
for designing jobs, but high levels of specialization may cause 
employee dissatisfaction and boredom. One technique for 
overcoming these problems is job rotation.
Identify the various bases for 
departmentalization.
Departmentalization is the grouping of jobs into manageable 
units. Typical bases for departmentalization are by function, 
product, location, or customer. Because each of these bases 
provides particular advantages, most firms—especially larger 
ones—use a combination of different bases in different 
organizational situations.
Explain how decentralization follows from 
delegation.
Delegation is the assigning of part of a manager’s work 
to other workers. It involves the following three steps: 
(1) assigning responsibility, (2) granting authority, and (3) 
creating accountability. A decentralized firm is one that 
delegates as much power as possible to people in the lower 
management levels. In a centralized firm, on the other hand, 
power is systematically retained at the upper levels.
Understand how the span of management 
describes an organization.
The span of management is the number of workers who report 
directly to a manager. Spans generally are characterized as 
wide (many workers per manager) or narrow (few workers 
per manager). Wide spans generally result in flat organizations 
(few layers of management); narrow spans generally result in 
tall organizations (many layers of management).
Describe the four basic forms of organizational 
structure.
There are four basic forms of organizational structure. The 
line structure is the oldest and most simple structure, in which 
the chain of command goes in a straight line from person to 
person down through the levels of management. The line-
and-staff structure is similar to the line structure, but adds 
specialists called staff managers to assist the line managers in 
decision making. The line structure works most efficiently for 
smaller organizations, whereas the line-and-staff structure is 
used by medium- and large-sized organizations. The matrix 
structure may be visualized as product departmentalization 
superimposed on functional departmentalization. With the 
matrix structure, an employee on a cross-functional team 
reports to both the project manager and the individual’s 
supervisor in a functional department. In an organization 
with a network structure, the primary function performed 
internally is administration, and other functions are 
contracted out to other firms.
Describe the effects of corporate culture.
Corporate culture has both internal and external effects on 
an organization. An organization’s culture can influence the 
way employees think and act, and it can also determine the 
public’s perception of the organization. Corporate culture can 
affect a firm’s performance over time, either negatively or 
positively. Creating a culture of trust, for example, can lead to 
increased growth, profits, productivity, and job satisfaction, 
while retaining the best employees, inspiring customer loyalty, 
developing new markets, and increasing creativity. In addition, 
when two or more companies undergo the integration process, 
their different or similar corporate cultures can affect the 
success of a merger or acquisition.
Understand how committees and task forces 
are used.
Committees and task forces are used to develop organizational 
structure within an organization. An ad hoc committee is 
created for a specific short-term purpose, whereas a standing 
committee is relatively permanent. A task force is created to 
investigate a major problem or pending decision.
Explain the functions of the informal organization 
and the grapevine in a business.
Informal groups are created by group members to accomplish 
goals that may or may not be relevant to the organization, 
and they can be very powerful forces. The grapevine—the 
informal communications network within an organization—
can be used to transmit information (important or gossip) 
through an organization much faster than through the 
formal communication network. Information transmitted 
through the grapevine can go in any direction across the 
organizational structure, skipping up or down levels of 
management and even across departments.

Discussion Questions
You might expect a company specializing in marketing organic 
teas to have a distinctive corporate culture. In the case of 
Numi Organic Tea, a progressive seller of premium organic 
and Fair Trade teas based in Oakland, California, you’d be 
right.
With a relatively small staff of about 50 people and a recent 
growth rate of 180 percent a year, Numi needs to remain nimble 
and responsive. Its founders, the brother-and-sister team of 
Ahmed and Reem Rahim, were inspired to create a tea com-
pany after Ahmed had spent some years operating tea houses in 
Europe while Reem studied art in the United States. Combining 
both their interests led to a unique firm dedicated to quality, sus-
tainability, and community. Numi occupies offices that include a 
tea garden where employees often gather to relax, and it has won 
awards for many achievements including its unique teas, its inno-
vative packaging, and its commitment to the environment. Numi’s 
25 different tea and flowering tea products and gift packs are 
sold in Whole Foods and Safeway markets, as well as in individual 
natural food and grocery stores throughout the United States, 
and in 20 other countries overseas.
The prevailing attitude in the company, which maintains a 
blog and a presence on Facebook and MySpace, is a can-do, 
team-oriented spirit. Because it’s a small firm where everyone 
works hard, Numi can’t afford rapid employee turnover and the 
time that would be lost in recruiting, interviewing, and training.  
Employees are thus carefully chosen for their willingness to do 
whatever it takes to get the job done and to remain upbeat and 
positive despite the occasional stress of working for a small 
company with customers around the world. Workers must also 
be able to devote long hours when necessary and share the 
­company’s goals.
Employees in Numi’s distribution center, for instance, recently 
found themselves under pressure because it was taking nearly two 
weeks to fill international orders. However, with a new manager 
and a new focus on everyone understanding how each job fit 
into the big picture, a sense of teamwork began to grow. Soon 
each employee had been trained to perform all the critical tasks 
in order fulfillment, so instead of working in isolation they were 
able to pitch in during crunch times. Their new flexibility reduced 
lead times for overseas orders to about five days and cut the time

for domestic orders in half. In fact, sometimes the team can ship 
orders the same day.
At Numi, managers who communicate well and who are out 
working alongside their staff are the norm. They must also com-
municate well with customers and demonstrate a high level of 
emotional maturity. Some meet with their teams on a regular 
basis, to review project status against deadlines and due dates 
and to make changes in workload and procedures where neces-
sary. The company offers flextime to help employees retain a bal-
ance between their work and personal life, and when things get 
overwhelming at the office, there’s always the tea garden and a 
freshly brewed cup of organic tea.11
Questions
1.	 Numi’s customer service manager, Cindy Graffort, says the 
company is like a “living, breathing organism.” What does she 
mean? How does the company’s culture reflect this belief?
2.	 Numi’s distribution manager, Dannielle Oviedo, says her phi-
losophy of management means she gets involved in what her 
team is doing: “I do what I ask folks to do.” Do you think she 
is a good delegator? Why or why not?
3.	 What can you infer about Numi’s basis for departmentaliza-
tion and its chain of command?
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is the original “started in a garage” tech-
nology company, founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in 
1939. Over the years, HP has grown into a market leader, with 
$114 billion in annual revenue, 300,000 employees worldwide, 
and tens of millions of customers on six continents. Its rivals, 
multinationals such as Apple, Dell, Acer, and Lenovo, never 
stop looking for the next big tech breakthrough. No wonder HP, 
approaching its 75th birthday, uses its organizational structure 
for competitive advantage in the 21st-century race for higher sales 
and profits.
The company has seven divisions, organized according to 
product or function: Services, Enterprise Storage and Servers, HP 
Software, the Personal Systems Group, the Imaging and Printing 
Group, HP Financial Services, and Corporate Investments. 
Within each division are business units organized by product. 
For example, the services division contains four main units 
(infrastructure technology outsourcing, applications services, 
business process outsourcing, and technology services). Each 
unit hires managers and employees with the particular skills, 
experience, and training appropriate for the services it offers.
Some HP business units are organized by customer and by 
product within a division. The Personal Systems Group, for 
example, includes one unit that focuses on commercial PCs and 
one that focuses on consumer PCs. Establishing these as sepa-
rate business units allows HP to address differences in products 
and customers’ needs while sharing expertise within the division. 
For efficiency, some functions straddle divisions and serve mul-
tiple units. The company recently consolidated its data-center 
operations and now has six megacenters instead of 85 smaller 
centers for data management.
Through its organizational structure, HP seeks to achieve 
two key objectives. First, knowing that technological change can 
occur at any time and move in unexpected directions, the com-
pany is determined to remain agile and adaptable. Its structure 
leaves day-to-day planning, decisions, and implementation in 
the hands of each unit’s managers, allowing them to satisfy cus-
tomers, initiate projects, and respond to environmental shifts 
without delay. Major decisions that affect the overall organiza-
tion, such as whether to acquire another company, are made at 
higher levels.
Second, the company uses its structure to support growth. 
Eyeing a larger share of the $1.7 trillion global market for infor-
mation technology, HP has been steadily adding to its portfolio 
of goods and services. Some of this expansion has occurred 
through acquisition. During the past few years, HP has bought 
EDS, 3Com, and Palm, among other businesses, and merged 
their operations into the appropriate corporate divisions. Palm, 
a pioneer of handheld computing devices and maker of smart-
phones, was integrated into HP’s Personal Systems Group to 
enhance that division’s technical capabilities in preparation for 
future growth.
Innovation has been woven into the fabric of HP’s corporate 
culture since the early days. The company is famous for invest-
ing billions of dollars annually to research new technology and 
develop new products. Although senior managers don’t want 
to stifle innovation by imposing too many limits, they have very 
clear expectations for research projects. “The key change we 
made was to take our brilliant scientists and sharpen their focus 
around a much smaller pool of big bets,” explains the head of 
HP Labs. Researchers know that “every single [project] must 
have the potential to [generate] $1 billion-plus in revenue for 
HP.” As a result, instead of pursuing as many as 150 projects at 
any given time, researchers now concentrate their efforts on the 
most promising two dozen projects.
Top managers are also involved in coordinating the overall 
efforts of employees that serve their very largest customers. For 
example, HP has a $3 billion contract to handle information tech-
nology operations for Procter & Gamble on an outsourcing basis. 
The head of the HP division visits with Procter & Gamble’s senior 
managers six times a year to jointly evaluate performance. HP’s 
CEO also joins the conversation at least twice a year. “When you 
have the CEO of a company sitting across the table saying, ‘We’re 
going to deliver this,’ you know they’re going to deliver,” says a 
senior Procter & Gamble executive.12

1 	SOCIAL MEDIA EXERCISE
Zappo’s is a company that embraces the notion that customers 
come first. It is well known that this company is customer-centered. 
One of the ways that it allows employees to communicate with 
customers is through its blog www.zapposinsights.com/blog.
1.	 Take a look at this blog. What can you tell about the corpo-
rate culture of Zappo’s?
2.	 How do they approach customer service? Do you think it 
works? Why or why not?
2 	JOURNALING FOR SUCCESS
Discovery statement: This chapter described the powerful influ-
ence that a corporate culture has on an organization.
Assume that after leaving school, you are hired by your “dream 
company.”
Assignment
1.	 What are the major corporate culture dimensions of your 
dream company?
2.	 Before accepting a job at your “dream company,” how will 
you find out about the company’s corporate culture?
3.	 From Figure 7.7, identify the type of corporate culture that 
you prefer and explain why.
4.	 Thinking back to previous jobs that you have had, describe 
the worst corporate culture you have ever experienced.
3 	DEVELOPING CRITICAL-THINKING SKILLS
A firm’s culture is a reflection of its most basic beliefs, values, 
customs, and rituals. Because it can have a powerful influence 
on how employees think and act, this culture also can have a 
powerful influence on a firm’s performance. The influence may 
be for the better, of course, as in the case of Kraft Foods, or 
it may be for the worse, as in the case of a bureaucratic orga-
nization whose employees feel hopelessly mired in red tape. 
When a company is concerned about mediocre performance 
and declining sales figures, its managers would do well to 
examine the cultural environment to see what might be in need 
of change.
Assignment
1.	 Analyze the cultural environment in which you work. (If you 
have no job, consider your school as your workplace and  
your instructor as your supervisor.) Ask yourself and your  
co-workers (or classmates) the following questions and record 
the answers:
a.	 Do you feel that your supervisors welcome your ideas and 
respect them even when they may disagree with them? 
Do you take pride in your work? Do you feel that your 
work is appreciated? Do you think that the amount of 
work assigned to you is reasonable? Are you compensated 
adequately for your work?
b.	 Are you proud to be associated with the company? Do 
you believe what the company says about itself in its 
advertisements? Are there any company policies or rules, 
written or unwritten, that you feel are unfair? Do you 
think that there is an opportunity for you to advance in 
this environment?
c.	 How much independence do you have in carrying out your 
assignments? Are you ever allowed to act on your own, or 
do you feel that you have to consult with your supervisor 
on every detail?
d.	 Do you enjoy the atmosphere in which you work? Is the 
physical setting pleasant? How often do you laugh in an 
average workday? How well do you get along with your 
supervisor and co-workers?
e.	 Do you feel that the company cares about you? Will your 
supervisor give you time off when you have some pressing 
personal need? If the company had to downsize, how do 
you think you would be treated?
2.	 Using the responses to these questions, write a two-page 
paper describing how the culture of your workplace affects 
your performance and the overall performance of the firm. 
Point out the cultural factors that have the most beneficial 
and negative effects. Include your thoughts on how negative 
effects could be reversed.
4 	BUILDING TEAM SKILLS
An organization chart is a diagram showing how employees 
and tasks are grouped and how the lines of communication 
and authority flow within an organization. These charts can 
look very different depending on a number of factors, includ-
ing the nature and size of the business, the way it is depart-
mentalized, its patterns of delegating authority, and its span of 
management.
Assignment
1.	 Working in a team, use the following information to draw an 
organization chart: The KDS Design Center works closely with 
two home-construction companies, ACME Homebuilders and 
Highmass. KDS’s role is to help customers select materials for

their new homes and to ensure that their selections are com-
municated accurately to the builders. The company is also a 
retailer of wallpaper, blinds, and drapery. The retail depart-
ment, the ACME Homebuilders accounts, and the Highmass 
accounts make up KDS’s three departments. The company 
has the following positions: president, executive vice presi-
dent, managers, two appointment coordinators, two ACME 
Homebuilders coordinators, two Highmass coordinators, two 
consultants/designers for the Amex and Highmass accounts, 
15 retail positions, and four payroll and billing personnel.
2.	 After your team has drawn the organization chart, discuss the 
following:
a.	 What type of organizational structure does your chart 
depict? Is it a bureaucratic, matrix, cluster, or network 
structure? Why?
b.	 How does KDS use departmentalization?
c.	 To what extent is authority in the company centralized or 
decentralized?
d.	 What is the span of management within KDS?
e.	 Which positions are line positions and which are staff? Why?
3.	 Prepare a three-page report summarizing what the chart 
revealed about relationships and tasks at the KDS Design 
Center and what your team learned about the value of organi-
zation charts. Include your chart in your report.
5 	RESEARCHING DIFFERENT CAREERS
In the past, company loyalty and the ability to assume increasing 
job responsibility usually ensured advancement within an organi-
zation. While the reasons for seeking advancement (the desire for 
a better-paying position, more prestige, and job satisfaction) have 
not changed, the qualifications for career advancement have. 
In today’s business environment, climbing the corporate ­ladder 
requires packaging and marketing yourself. To be promoted 
within your company or to be considered for employment with 
another company, it is wise to improve your skills continually.

here’s a good chance when you saw the name Unilever in the Inside Business 
opening case for this chapter you didn’t recognize a company that operates 
in 190 countries around the globe and employs 170,000 people. And yet, 
this company generates annual sales exceeding $62 billion by producing consumer 
products that you may use on a regular basis including Axe, Bertolli, Ben & Jerry’s, 
Dove, Knorr, Lipton, Vaseline, and Sunlight.  In fact, on any given day, more than two 
billion people use Unilever products to look good, feel good, and get more out of life. 
Although the company was founded more than 120 years ago and has been extremely 
profitable, Unilver continues to innovate and introduce new products to compete with 
not only local firms but also global giants including Procter & Gamble and Nestle. 
At the same time, it is a company known for its efforts to sustain the planet. Today, 
Unilever is an excellent example of what this chapter’s content—the production of 
quality goods and services—is all about. 
We begin this chapter with an overview of operations management—the activi-
ties required to produce goods and services that meet the needs of customers. In this 
section, we also discuss the role of manufacturing in the U.S. economy, competition 
in the global marketplace, and careers in operations management. Next, we describe 
the conversion process that makes production possible and also note the growing role 
of services in our economy. Then we examine more closely three important aspects of 
operations management: developing ideas for new products, planning for production, 
Inside
Business
Unilever: Producing Quality Goods the Green Way
Unilever, with headquarters in London and Rotterdam, aims to double sales worldwide and 
slash its environmental footprint in half by 2020. These are aggressive goals even for a $62 
billion company with 170,000 employees and more than 120 years of experience producing 
high quality skin-care products, foods, and other consumer goods. Some of the most famous 
brands in Unilever’s pantry are Axe, Bertolli, Ben & Jerry’s, Dove, Knorr, Lipton, Vaseline, and 
Sunlight. The Dove brand alone accounts for $3.7 billion in annual global sales. 
To compete with local firms as well as with multinational giants such as Nestlé and 
Procter & Gamble, Unilever spends $1.3 billion each year on research and development. 
More than 6,000 Unilever researchers worldwide work closely with experts from the com-
pany’s Safety and Environmental Assurance Center to develop new products and production 
processes that are safe, effective, and innovative. In particular, the company is focused on 
improving the nutritional value of its food products, and it has invested heavily to create 
healthy new foods with lower fat and salt content, fewer calories, and less sugar. 
Unilever is also building greener, more energy-efficient production facilities to support 
sustainable growth in international markets, which account for 56 percent of sales. For exam-
ple, it recently opened a new manufacturing plant in South Africa to produce Knorr soup 
mixes and other packaged foods. This is Unilever’s most environmentally-friendly factory: it 
recycles rainwater for plant use, composts unneeded materials in local gardens, and reuses 
packaging so nothing lands in landfills. Once fully expanded, this factory—the size of three 
soccer fields—will have the largest production capacity of any of Unilever’s dry-food facilities.
Although large corporations often try to improve their profit margins by squeezing sup-
pliers for more savings, Unilever prefers a partnership approach. Instead of seeking to buy at 
the lowest cost, it shares its long-term goals with key suppliers of raw materials, packaging, 
and services, inviting them to jointly develop product and process innovations for mutual 
benefit. As a result, suppliers have provided the inspiration for hundreds of items that are 
currently in Unilever’s new-product pipeline.1

and effectively controlling operations after production has begun. We close the chap-
ter with a look at the productivity trends and the ways that manufacturing can be 
improved through the use of technology.
What Is Production?
Have you ever wondered where a new pair of Levi’s jeans comes from? Or an Apple 
iPhone, or a Uniroyal tire for your car? Even factory service on a Hewlett-Packard 
computer or a Maytag clothes dryer would be impossible if it weren’t for the activities 
described in this chapter. In fact, these products and services and millions of others like 
them would not exist if it weren’t for production activities.
Let’s begin this chapter by reviewing what an operating manager does. In 
Chapter 6, we described an operations manager as a person who manages the systems 
that convert resources into goods and services. This area of management is usually 
referred to as operations management, which consists of all the activities required 
to produce goods and services.
To produce a product or service successfully, a business must perform a number 
of specific activities. For example, suppose that Toyota (the parent company of Lexus 
automobiles) has an idea for a new, sport version of the Lexus GS 350 that will cost 
approximately $50,000. Marketing research must determine not only if customers are 
willing to pay the price for this product but also what special features they want. Then 
Toyota’s operations managers must turn the idea into reality.
Toyota’s managers cannot just push the “start button” and immediately begin 
producing the new automobile. Production must be planned. As you will see, plan-
ning takes place both before anything is produced and during the production process.
Managers also must concern themselves with the control of operations to ensure 
that the organization’s goals are achieved. For a product such as the Lexus GS 350, 
control of operations involves a number of important issues, including product quality, 
performance standards, the amount of inventory of both raw materials and finished 
products, and production costs.
We discuss each of the major activities of operations management later in this 
chapter. First, however, let’s take a closer look at American manufacturers and how 
they compete in the global marketplace.
How American Manufacturers 
Compete in the Global Marketplace
After World War II, the United States became the most productive 
country in the world. For almost 30 years, until the late 1970s, its 
leadership was never threatened. By then, however, manufacturers 
in Japan, Germany, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Sweden, and other 
industrialized nations were offering U.S. firms increasing competition. 
Now the Chinese are manufacturing everything from sophisticated 
electronic equipment and automobiles to less expensive everyday 
items—often at a lower cost than the same goods can be manufactured 
in other countries. And yet, in the face of increasing competition, there 
is both good and bad news for U.S. manufacturers. First the bad news.
The Bad News for Manufacturers  The number of Americans 
employed in the manufacturing sector has decreased. Currently, 
approximately 12 million U.S. workers are employed in manufac-
turing jobs—down from just over 19 million back in 1979.2 While 
there are many additional factors, three major factors explain why 
employment in this economic sector has declined.
●
●Many of the manufacturing jobs that were lost were outsourced 
to low-wage workers in nations where there are few labor and 
environmental regulations.
Explain the nature of 
production.

●It costs about 20 percent more to manufacture goods in the United States than it 
does anywhere else in the world.3
●
●The number of unemployed factory workers increased during the recent economic 
crisis because of decreased consumer demand for manufactured goods.
As a result, manufacturing accounts for only about 9 percent of the current workforce.4 
Since 1979, 7 million jobs have been lost, and many of those jobs aren’t coming back.
The Good News for Manufacturers  The United States remains one of the largest 
manufacturing countries in the world. While some people would argue that “Made in 
America” doesn’t mean what it used to mean, consider the following:
●
●U.S. manufacturers produce approximately 20 percent of total global manufactur-
ing output.5
●
●Every year, manufacturing contributes approximately $2 trillion to the U.S. economy.6
●
●Manufacturing exports are nearly 60 percent of all U.S. exports.7
●
●Between now and 2018, it is anticipated that there will be 2 million job openings 
in manufacturing.8
●
●For every new manufacturing job created, there are another three new jobs created 
in the supply chain, the trucking industry, and other related areas of the economy.9
As a result, the manufacturing sector is still a very important part of the U.S. 
economy. Although the number of manufacturing jobs has declined, productivity has 
increased. At least two very important factors account for increases in productivity: 
First, innovation—finding a better way to produce products—is the key factor that has 
enabled American manufacturers to compete in the global marketplace. Often, innova-
tion is the result of manufacturers investing money to purchase new, state-of-the-art 
equipment that helps employees improve productivity. Second, today’s workers in the 
manufacturing sector are highly skilled in order to operate sophisticated equipment. 
Simply put, Americans are making more goods, but with fewer employees.
Even more good news is that many American manufacturers that outsourced work 
to factories in foreign nations are once again beginning to manufacture goods in the 
United States. For our purposes, the term reshoring (sometimes referred to as onshor-
ing or insourcing) describes a situation where U.S. manufacturers bring manufacturing 
jobs back to the United States. For example, General Electric (GE) opened a new plant 
in Louisville, Kentucky, to manufacture hybrid electric water heaters in 2012.10 Before 
the Kentucky plant was built, the water heaters were manufactured in China.11 Ford, 
Procter & Gamble, NCR, Caterpillar, Honda, Intel, and Master Lock and many other 
U.S. firms are involved in reshoring. The primary reasons why U.S. firms are “coming 
back home” include increasing labor costs in foreign nations, higher shipping costs, 
significant quality and safety issues, faster product development when goods are pro-
duced in the United States, and federal and state subsidies to encourage manufactures 
to produce products in the United States.
Although there are many challenges facing U.S. manufacturers, experts predict 
that there could be a significant resurgence for manufacturers that can meet current 
and future challenges. The bottom line: The global marketplace has never been more 
competitive and successful U.S. firms will focus on the following:
	 1.	Meeting the needs of customers and improving product quality.
	 2.	Motivating employees to cooperate with management and improve productivity.
	 3.	Reducing costs by selecting suppliers that offer higher quality raw materials and 
components at reasonable prices.
	 4.	Using computer-aided and flexible manufacturing systems that allow a higher 
degree of customization.
	 5.	Improving control procedures to help ensure lower manufacturing costs.
	 6.	Using green manufacturing to conserve natural resources and sustain the planet.
For most firms, competing in the global marketplace is not only profitable but also 
an essential activity that requires the cooperation of everyone within the organization.

Careers in Operations Management
Although it is hard to provide information about specific career opportunities in 
operations management, some generalizations do apply to this management area. First, 
you must appreciate the manufacturing process and the steps required to produce a 
product or service. A basic understanding of mass production and the difference 
between an analytical process and a synthetic process is essential. Mass production 
is a manufacturing process that lowers the cost required to produce a large number 
of identical or similar products over a long period of time. An analytical process 
breaks raw materials into different component parts. For example, a barrel of crude oil 
refined by Marathon Oil Corporation—a Texas-based oil and chemical refiner—can be 
broken down into gasoline, oil, lubricants, and many other petroleum by-products. A 
synthetic process is just the opposite of the analytical one; it combines raw materials 
or components to create a finished product. Black & Decker uses a synthetic process 
when it combines plastic, steel, rechargeable batteries, and other components to produce 
a cordless drill.
Once you understand that operations managers are responsible for producing tan-
gible products or services that customers want, you must determine how you fit into 
the production process. Today’s successful operations managers must:
	 1.	Be able to motivate and lead people.
	 2.	Understand how technology can make a manufacturer more productive and efficient.
	 3.	Appreciate the control processes that help lower production costs and improve 
product quality.
	 4.	Understand the relationship between the customer, the marketing of a product, and 
the production of a product.
If operations management seems like an area you might be interested in, why not 
do more career exploration?
The Conversion Process
The purpose of manufacturing or a service business is to provide utility to customers. 
Utility is the ability of a good or service to satisfy a human need. Although there 
are four types of utilities—form, place, time, and possession—
operations management focuses primarily on form utility. Form 
utility is created by people converting raw materials, finances, and 
information into finished products. The other types of utility—
place, time, and possession—are discussed in Chapter 12.
But how does the conversion take place? How does Kellogg’s 
convert grain, sugar, salt, and other ingredients; money from 
previous sales and stockholders’ investments; production work-
ers and managers; and economic and marketing forecasts into 
Frosted Flakes cereal products? How does H&R Block employ 
more than 100,000 tax preparers and convert retail locations, 
computers and software, and advertising and promotion into tax 
services for its clients. They do so through the use of a conver-
sion process like the one illustrated in Figure 8.1. As indicated by 
our H&R Block example, the conversion process can be used to 
produce services.
Factors That Affect a Conversion Process
The conversion of resources into products and services can be 
described in several ways. We limit our discussion here to three: 
the focus or major resource used in the conversion process, its 
magnitude of change, and the number of production processes 
employed.
Outline how the conversion 
process transforms raw 
materials, labor, and other 
resources into finished goods 
or services.

Part 3   Management and Organization
Focus  By the focus of a conversion process, we mean the resource or resources that 
make up the major or most important input. The resources are financial, material, 
information, and people—the same resources discussed in Chapters 1 and 6. For a 
bank such as Citibank, financial resources are the major resource. A chemical and 
energy company such as Chevron concentrates on material resources. Your college or 
university is concerned primarily with information. And temporary employment ser-
vices, such as Manpower, focus on the use of human resources.
Magnitude of Change  The magnitude of a conversion process is the degree to which 
the resources are physically changed. At one extreme lie such processes as the one by 
The conversion process converts ideas and resources into useful goods and 
services. The ability to create ideas and to produce goods and services is a crucial 
step in the economic development of any nation.

uid or powder form are combined to produce long, thin sheets of plastic Glad Cling Wrap. 
Here, the original resources are totally unrecognizable in the finished product. At the other 
extreme, Southwest Airlines produces no physical change in its original resources. The 
airline simply provides a service and transports people from one place to another.
Number of Production Processes  A single firm may employ one production 
process or many. In general, larger firms that make a variety of products use multiple 
production processes. For example, GE manufactures some of its own products, buys 
other merchandise from suppliers, and operates multiple divisions including a finance 
division, a lighting division, an appliance division, a healthcare division, and other divi-
sions responsible for the products and services that customers associate with the GE 
name. Smaller firms, by contrast, may use one production process. For example, Texas-
based Advanced Cast Stone, Inc., manufactures one basic product: building materials 
made from concrete.
The Increasing Importance of Services
The application of the basic principles of operations management to the production of 
services has coincided with a dramatic growth in the number and diversity of service 
businesses. In 1900, only 28 percent of American workers were employed in service 
firms. By 1950, this figure had grown to 40 percent, and by 2011, it had risen to 87 
percent.12 In fact, the American economy is now characterized as a service economy 
(see Figure 8.2). A service economy is one in which more effort is devoted to the 
production of services than to the production of goods.
Planning Quality Services
Today, the managers of restaurants, laundries, real estate agencies, banks, movie theaters, 
airlines, travel bureaus, and other service firms have realized that they can benefit from the 
experience of manufacturers. And while service firms are different from manufacturing 
firms, both types of businesses must complete many of the same activities in order to 
be successful. For example, as illustrated in the middle section of Figure 8.1, service 
businesses must plan, design, execute, evaluate, improve, and redesign their services in 
order to provide the services that their customers want.
For a service firm, planning often begins with determining who the customer is 
and what needs the customer has. After customer needs are identified, the next step for

Part 3   Management and Organization
successful service firms is to develop a plan that will enable the firm to deliver the ser-
vices that their customers want or need. For example, a swimming pool repair business 
must develop a business plan that includes a process for hiring and training qualified 
employees, obtaining necessary parts and supplies, marketing the firm’s services, and 
creating management and accounting systems to control the firm’s activities. Once the 
firm provides a service to a customer, successful firms evaluate their operating systems 
and measure customer satisfaction. And if necessary, redesign their operating systems 
and their services to improve the customer’s experience. 
Evaluating the Quality of a Firm’s Services
The production of services is very different from the production of manufactured 
goods in the following five ways:
	 1.	When compared to manufactured goods, customers are much more involved in 
obtaining the service they want or need.
	 2.	Services are consumed immediately and, unlike manufactured goods, cannot be 
stored. For example, a hair stylist cannot store completed haircuts.
	 3.	Services are provided when and where the customer desires the service. In many 
cases, customers will not travel as far to obtain a service.
	 4.	Services are usually labor-intensive because the human resource is often the most 
important resource used in the production of services.
	 5.	Services are intangible, and it is therefore more difficult to evaluate customer 
satisfaction.13
Although it is often more difficult to measure the customer’s level of satisfaction, 
today’s successful service firms work hard to exceed the customer’s expectations. To make 
their guests feel at home, Affinia Hotels has developed a revolutionary new customer 
service program that allows guests to customize every aspect of their stay. Using the new 
online service, guests of this upscale hotel chain can pre-select not only the type of pillow 
they want, but also amenities including a guitar, golf ball and putter, a fitness kit, or even a 
rubber ducky to help make their stay perfect and at the same time build repeat business.14
Compared with manufacturers, service firms often listen more carefully to custom-
ers and respond more quickly to the market’s changing needs. For example, Maggiano’s 
Little Italy restaurant is a chain of eating establishments owned by Brinker International. 
In order to continuously improve customer service, the restaurant encourages diners to 
complete online surveys that prompt diners to evaluate the food, atmosphere, service, 
and other variables. The information from the surveys is then used to fine-tune the way 
Maggiano’s meets its customers’ needs.
In addition, many service firms are now using social media to build relationships 
with their customers. Coldwell Banker, one of the largest real estate companies in the 
United States sponsors an Internet blog that can be used not only to provide information 
about the current housing market, but also as a method to encourage comments and 
questions from customers. And Olive Garden, the restaurant chain owned by the Darden 
family of restaurants, uses the Internet to provide recipes for many of its menu items so 
customers can try their hand at creating the “perfect” Italian meal in their own kitchens.
Now that we understand something about the production process that is used to 
transform resources into goods and services, we can consider three major activities 
involved in operations management: research and development, planning for produc-
tion, and operations control.
Where Do New Products 
and Services Come From?
No firm can produce a product or service until it has an idea. Both Apple’s iPad and 
Ford’s Electric Focus automobile began as an idea. Although no one can predict with 
100 percent accuracy what types of products and services will be available in the next

five years, it is safe to say that companies will continue 
to introduce new products and services that will change 
our everyday lives.
Research and Development
How did we get the Apple iPad or the Electric Ford 
Focus automobile? We got them as a result of people 
working with new ideas that developed into useful 
products. These activities generally are referred to as 
research and development. For our purposes, research and 
development (R&D) involves a set of activities intended to 
identify new ideas that have the potential to result in new 
goods and services.
Today, business firms use three general types of R&D activi-
ties. Basic research consists of activities aimed at uncovering new 
knowledge. The goal of basic research is scientific advancement, 
without regard for its potential use in the development of goods 
and services. Applied research, in contrast, consists of activities 
geared toward discovering new knowledge with some potential 
use. Development and implementation involves research activi-
ties undertaken specifically to put new or existing knowledge 
to use in producing goods and services. For many companies, 
R&D is a very important part of their business operations. The 
3M company, for example, has always been known for its devel-
opment and implementation research activities. Currently, 3M 
employs 7,350 researchers worldwide and has invested more than $7 billion over the 
last five years to develop new products designed to make people’s lives easier and safer.15
Product Extension and Refinement
When a brand-new product is first marketed, its sales start at zero and slowly increase 
from that point. If the product is successful, annual sales increase more and more rapidly 
until they reach some peak. Then, as time passes, annual sales begin to decline, and they 
continue to decline until it is no longer profitable to manufacture the 
product. (This rise-and-decline pattern, called the product life-cycle, is 
discussed in more detail in Chapter 13.)
If a firm sells only one product, when that product reaches the 
end of its life-cycle, the firm will die, too. To stay in business, the 
firm must, at the very least, find ways to refine or extend the want-
satisfying capability of its product. Consider television sets. Since 
they were introduced in the late 1930s, television sets have been 
constantly refined so that they now provide clearer, sharper pictures 
with less dial adjusting. During the same time, television sets also 
were extended. There are basic flat-screen televisions without added 
features, and many others that include DVD or Blu-Ray players and 
Internet streaming options. The latest development—high-defini-
tion television—has already become the standard.
For most firms, extension and refinement are expected results 
of their research, development, and implementation activities. Each 
refinement or extension results in an essentially “new” product 
whose sales make up for the declining sales of a product that was 
introduced earlier. When consumers were introduced to the original 
five varieties of Campbell’s Soup, they discovered that these soups 
were of the highest quality, as well as inexpensive, and the soups were 
an instant success. Although one of the most successful companies at 
the beginning of the 1900s, Campbell’s had to continue to innovate, 
refine, and extend its product line. For example, many consumers in

How Do Managers Plan Production?
Only a few of the many ideas for new products, refinements, and extensions ever reach 
the production stage. For those ideas that do, however, the next step is planning for 
production. Once a new idea for a product or service has been identified, planning for 
production involves three different phases: design planning, facilities planning, and 
operational planning (see Figure 8.3).
Design Planning
When the R&D staff at Samsung recommended to top management that the firm 
manufacture and market a “Smart Fridge” with an LCD screen, Wi-Fi connectivity, 
and apps that allow consumers to update their calendars, leave 
notes to family members, or listen to music, the company could 
not simply swing into production the next day. Instead, a great 
deal of time and energy had to be invested in determining what 
the new refrigerator would look like, where and how it would be 
produced, and what options would be included. These decisions are 
a part of design planning. Design planning is the development of 
a plan for converting an idea into an actual product or service. The 
major decisions involved in design planning deal with product line, 
required capacity, and use of technology.
Product Line  A product line is a group of similar products that 
differ only in relatively minor characteristics. During the design-
planning stage, a manufacturer like Samsung must determine how 
many different models to produce and what major options to offer. 
Likewise, a restaurant chain such as Pizza Hut must decide how 
many menu items to offer.

Nobody likes to fail, but making a mistake 
can teach you a lot—and set the stage for 
future successes. For example, new products 
or production processes don’t always turn out 
the way you’d expect on the first try. Eileen Fisher, founder of 
the Eileen Fisher apparel firm in New York City, knows this from 
first-hand experience. She and her employees are constantly 
designing new items of clothing to be sold in department and 
specialty stores around the country. “Often the first time you 
produce a garment or work with a new fabric, you have to 
tweak it,” she explains. “In the mistake is the next success.”
Dr. Paul J. H. Schoemaker, author of Brilliant Mistakes, 
believes that employers should actually encourage mistakes 
because “they are often the source of deep personal learning, 
breakthrough ideas in business, and game-changing advances.” 
Businesses need to take some small, calculated risks, if only to 
get a sense of what’s most promising (and what’s not) before 
making a larger-scale change. Finally, if you make some small 
mistakes early in your career and take the time to analyze what 
went wrong, you’ll be better prepared for the bigger decisions 
you’re likely to face later in your career.

Chapter 8   Producing Quality Goods and Services 
221
An important issue in deciding on the product line is to balance customer pref-
erences and production requirements. For this reason, marketing managers play an 
important role in making product-line decisions. Typically, marketing personnel want 
a “long” product line that offers customers many options. Because a long product 
line with more options gives customers greater choice, it is easier to sell products that 
meet the needs of individual customers. On the other hand, production personnel 
generally want a “short” product line with fewer options because products are easier 
to produce.
Once the product line has been determined, each distinct product within the 
product line must be designed. Product design is the process of creating a set 
of specifications from which a product can be produced. When designing a new 
product, specifications are extremely important. For example, product engineers for 
Samsung must make sure that their new “Smart Fridge” keeps food frozen in the 
freezer compartment. At the same time, they must make sure that lettuce and toma-
toes do not freeze in the crisper section of the refrigerator. The need for a complete 
product design is fairly obvious; products that work cannot be manufactured with-
out it. But services should be designed carefully as well—and for the same reason.
Required Production Capacity  Capacity is the amount of products or services 
that an organization can produce in a given period of time. (For example, the capac-
ity of a Panasonic assembly plant might be 1.3 million high-definition televisions per 
year.) Operations managers—again working with the firm’s marketing managers—
must determine the required capacity. This, in turn, determines the size of the produc-
tion facility. If the facility is built with too much capacity, valuable resources (plant, 
equipment, and money) will lie idle. If the facility offers insufficient capacity, additional 
capacity may have to be added later when it is much more expensive than in the initial 
building stage.
Capacity means about the same thing to service businesses. For example, the capac-
ity of a restaurant such as the Hard Rock Cafe in Nashville, Tennessee, is the number 
of customers it can serve at one time. As with the Panasonic manufacturing facility 
described earlier, if the restaurant is built with too much capacity—too many tables 
and chairs—valuable resources will be wasted. If the restaurant is too small, customers 
may have to wait for service; if the wait is too long, they may leave and choose another 
restaurant.

Part 3   Management and Organization
Use of Technology  During the design-planning 
stage, management must determine the degree to which 
automation and technology will be used to produce a 
product or service. Here, there is a trade-off between 
high initial costs and low operating costs (for automa-
tion) and low initial costs and high operating costs (for 
human labor). Ultimately, management must choose 
between a labor-intensive technology and a capital-
intensive technology. A labor-intensive ­technology 
is a process in which people must do most of the work. 
Housecleaning services and the New York Yankees baseball 
team, for example, are labor-intensive. A capital-intensive 
technology is a process in which machines and equipment 
do most of the work. A Sony automated assembly plant is 
capital intensive.
Site Selection and Facilities Planning
Generally, a business will choose to produce a new product 
in an existing factory as long as (1) the existing factory has 
enough capacity to handle customer demand for both the 
new product and established products and (2) the cost of 
refurbishing an existing factory is less than the cost of building 
a new one.
After exploring the capacity of existing factories, man-
agement may decide to build a new production facility. In 
determining where to locate production facilities, manage-
ment must consider a number of variables, including the 
following:
●
●Locations of major customers and suppliers.
●
●Availability and cost of skilled and unskilled labor.
●
●Quality of life for employees and management in the pro-
posed location.
●
●The cost of land and construction to build a new facility.
●
●Local and state taxes, environmental regulations, and 
zoning laws.
●
●The amount of financial support and subsidies, if any, 
offered by local and state governments.
●
●Special requirements, such as great amounts of energy or 
water used in the production process.
Before making a final decision about where a proposed plant will be located and how 
it will be organized, two other factors—human resources and plant layout—should be 
examined.
Human Resources  Several issues involved in site selection and facilities planning 
fall within the province of human resources managers. When Nestlé built its new 
900,000-square-foot production facility to make liquid Nesquik® and Coffee-Mate® 
products in Anderson, Indiana, human resources managers were involved to make sure 
the necessary managers and employees needed to staff the plant were available. And 
when a company decides to build a new facility in a foreign country, again human 
resources managers are involved. For example, suppose that a U.S. firm like AT&T 
wants to lower labor costs by importing products from China. It has two choices. It 
can build its own manufacturing facility in a foreign country or it can outsource pro-
duction to local firms. In either case, human resources become involved in the decision. 
If the decision is made to build its own plant, human resources managers will have to 
recruit managers and employees with the appropriate skills who are willing to relocate

to a foreign country, develop training programs for local Chinese 
workers, or both. On the other hand, if the decision is made to 
outsource production to local suppliers, human resources manag-
ers must make sure that local suppliers are complying with the U.S. 
company’s human rights policies and with all applicable national 
and local wage and hour laws.
Plant Layout  Plant layout is the arrangement of machinery, 
equipment, and personnel within a production facility. Three gen-
eral types of plant layout are used (see Figure 8.4).
The process layout is used when different operations are 
required for creating small batches of different products or work-
ing on different parts of a product. The plant is arranged so that 
each operation is performed in its own particular area. An auto 
repair facility at a local automobile dealership provides an exam-
ple of a process layout. The various operations may be engine 
repair, bodywork, wheel alignment, and safety inspection. If you 
take your Lincoln Navigator for a wheel alignment, your car “vis-
its” only the area where alignments are performed.
A product layout (sometimes referred to as an assembly line) 
is used when all products undergo the same operations in the 
same sequence. Workstations are arranged to match the sequence 
of operations, and work flows from station to station. An assem-
bly line is the best example of a product layout. For example, California-based 
Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., uses a product layout to manufacture components 
for consumer and business electronic products. A ­fixed-position layout is used when 
a very large product is produced. Aircraft manufacturers and shipbuilders apply this 
method because of the difficulty of moving a large product such as an airliner or a 
ship. The product remains stationary, and people and machines are moved as needed 
to assemble the product. Boeing, for example, uses the fixed-position layout to build 
787 Dreamliner jet aircraft at its Everett, Washington, manufacturing facility.
Operational Planning
The objective of operational planning is to decide on the amount 
of products or services each facility will produce during a specific 
period of time. Four steps are required.
Step 1: Selecting a Planning Horizon  A planning hori-
zon is simply the time period during which an operational plan 
will be in effect. A common planning horizon for production 
plans is one year. Then, before each year is up, management 
must plan for the next. A planning horizon of one year generally 
is long enough to average out seasonal increases and decreases 
in sales. At the same time, it is short enough for planners to 
adjust production to accommodate long-range sales trends.
Step 2: Estimating Market Demand  The market demand for 
a product is the quantity that customers will purchase at the going 
price. This quantity must be estimated for the time period covered 
by the planning horizon. Sales projections developed by marketing 
managers are the basis for market-demand estimates.
Step 3: Comparing Market Demand with Capacity  The 
third step in operational planning is to compare the estimated 
Ice cream that tastes as good as homemade. The 
goal for Roundy’s Supermarkets is to make their ice 
cream taste just like Mom’s—but production is on a much 
larger scale. To accomplish the task, the Wisconsin–
based company uses a stainless steel assembly line that 
snakes through the company’s food manufacturing and 
processing plant in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

A big product! The British Royal Navy’s aircraft 
carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth was constructed using 
a fixed-position layout. To see how large the ship is, 
compare its size with the people at the bottom of this 
photo. When a product is this large, it is easier to move 
people, machinery, and parts to where they are needed 
instead of moving the ship.

market demand with the facility’s capacity to satisfy that demand. (Remember that 
capacity is the amount of products or services that an organization can produce in 
a given time period.) One of three outcomes may result: Demand may exceed capac-
ity, capacity may exceed demand, or capacity and demand may be equal. If they are 
equal, the facility should be operated at full capacity. However, if market demand 
and capacity are not equal, adjustments may be necessary.
Step 4: Adjusting Products or Services to Meet Demand  The biggest rea-
son for changes to a firm’s production schedule is changes in the amount of products 
or services that a company sells to its customers. For example, Indiana-based Berry 
Plastics produces all kinds of plastic products. One particularly successful product 
line for Berry Plastics is drink cups that can be screen-printed to promote a company 
or its products or services.16 If Berry Plastics obtains a large contract to provide pro-
motional cups to a large fast-food chain such as Whataburger or McDonald’s, the 
The process layout is used when small batches of different products are created or when working on different parts of a 
product. The product layout (assembly line) is used when all products undergo the same operations in the same sequence. 
The fixed-position layout is used in producing a product too large to move.

purchasing  all the activities 
involved in obtaining required 
materials, supplies, components, 
and parts from other firms
company may need to work three shifts a day, seven days a week, until the contract 
is fulfilled. Unfortunately, the reverse is also true. If the company’s sales force does 
not generate new sales, there may be only enough work for the employees on one 
shift.
When market demand exceeds capacity, several options are available to a firm. 
Production of products or services may be increased by operating the facility overtime 
with existing personnel or by starting a second or third work shift. For manufactur-
ers, another response is to subcontract or outsource a portion of the work to other 
manufacturers. If the excess demand is likely to be permanent, the firm may expand 
the current facility or build another facility.
What happens when capacity exceeds market demand? Again, there are several 
options. To reduce output temporarily, workers may be laid off and part of the facility 
shut down, or the facility may be operated on a shorter-than-normal workweek for 
as long as the excess capacity persists. To adjust to a permanently decreased demand, 
management may shift the excess capacity of a manufacturing facility to the produc-
tion of other goods or services. The most radical adjustment is to eliminate the excess 
capacity by selling unused manufacturing facilities.
Operations Control
We have discussed the development of an idea for a product or service and the planning 
that translates that idea into the reality. Now we are ready to begin the actual production 
process. In this section, we examine four important areas of operations control: 
purchasing, inventory control, scheduling, and quality control (see Figure 8.5).
Purchasing
Purchasing consists of all the activities involved in obtaining required materials, 
supplies, components (or subassemblies), and parts from other firms. Levi Strauss, 
for example, must purchase denim cloth, thread, and zippers before it can produce a 
single pair of jeans. For all firms, the purchasing function is far from routine, and its 
importance should not be underestimated. For some products, purchased materials 
make up more than 50 percent of their wholesale costs.
The objective of purchasing is to ensure that required materials are available when 
they are needed, in the proper amounts, and at minimum cost. Generally, the company 
with purchasing needs and suppliers must develop a working relationship built on 
trust. In addition to a working relationship built on trust, many companies believe 
that purchasing is one area where they can promote diversity. For example, AT&T 
developed a Supplier Diversity Program in 1968. Today, more than 40 years later, goals 
for the AT&T program include purchasing a total of 21.5 percent of all products and 
services from minorities, women, and disabled veteran business enterprises.17
Purchasing personnel should constantly be on the lookout for new or backup sup-
pliers, even when their needs are being met by their present suppliers, because problems

use of purchasing, inventory control, scheduling, and quality control.

Part 3   Management and Organization
inventory control  the process 
of managing inventories in such 
a way as to minimize inventory 
costs, including both holding costs 
and potential stock-out costs
such as strikes and equipment breakdowns can cut off the flow of purchased materials 
from a primary supplier at any time.
The choice of suppliers should result from careful analysis of a number of factors. 
The following are especially critical:
●
●Price. Comparing prices offered by different suppliers is always an essential part 
of selecting a supplier.
●
●Quality. Purchasing specialists always try to buy materials at a level of quality in 
keeping with the type of product being manufactured. The lowest acceptable qual-
ity is usually specified by product designers.
●
●Reliability. An agreement to purchase high-quality materials at a low price is the 
purchaser’s dream. However, the dream becomes a nightmare if the supplier does 
not deliver.
●
●Credit terms. Purchasing specialists should determine if the supplier demands 
immediate payment or will extend credit.
●
●Shipping costs. The question of who pays the shipping costs should be answered 
before any supplier is chosen.
Inventory Control
Can you imagine what would happen if a Coca-Cola manufacturing plant ran out of the 
company’s familiar red-and-white aluminum cans? It would be impossible to complete 
the manufacturing process and ship the cases of Coke to retailers. Management would 
be forced to shut the assembly line down until the next shipment of cans arrived from 
a supplier. The simple fact is that shutdowns are expensive because costs such as wages, 
rent, utilities, insurance, and other expenses still must be covered.
Operations managers are concerned with three types of inventories. A raw-mate-
rials inventory consists of materials that will become part of the product during the 
production process. The work-in-process inventory consists of partially completed 
products. The finished-goods inventory consists of completed goods. Each type of 
inventory also has a holding cost, or storage cost, and a stock-out cost, the cost of 
running out of inventory. Inventory ­control is the process of managing inventories in 
such a way as to minimize inventory costs, including both holding costs and potential 
stock-out costs.
Africa’s New Role in Socially-Responsible Production
Entrepreneurial
Success

From boots to chocolate bars, Africa is 
attracting socially-responsible manufacturing 
firms that want to make good use of the 
continent’s abundance of raw materials. Tal 
Dehtiar started Oliberte with the goal of bringing good-paying 
jobs to Africa while selling high-quality fashion shoes in the 
world marketplace. Rather than build facilities from scratch, 
he partnered with local leather suppliers and small factories in 
Ethiopia, Liberia, and Kenya. Although output is relatively low—
the company makes and sells about 18,000 pairs of shoes per 
year—it is steadily increasing production capacity and expanding 
distribution as the Oliberte brand becomes better known.
Madecasse Chocolate, founded by former Peace Corps 
volunteers Tim McCollum and Brett Beach, transforms locally-
grown cocoa beans into premium chocolate bars for export 
from the company’s base in Madagascar. The entrepreneurs 
began by contracting with farming cooperatives that grow top-
quality cocoa. Next, they figured out how to transport a ton 
of cocoa beans to a contract manufacturing plant downriver, 
where the beans are roasted and turned into chocolate bars. 
Finally, they arranged for stores like Whole Foods Market to 
sell the chocolate bars. With annual sales topping $2 million, 
Madecasse Chocolate is about to expand its storage facilities 
to prepare for future growth.

Chapter 8   Producing Quality Goods and Services 
227
Today, computer systems are being used to keep track of inven-
tories and alert managers to impending stock-outs. One of the most 
sophisticated methods of inventory control used today is materials 
requirements planning. Materials requirements planning (MRP) 
is a computerized system that integrates production planning and 
inventory control. One of the great advantages of an MRP system 
is its ability to juggle delivery schedules and lead times effectively. 
For a complex product such as an automobile with 4,000 or more 
individual parts, it is virtually impossible for individual managers 
to oversee the hundreds of parts that go into the finished product. 
However, a manager using an MRP system can arrange both order 
and delivery schedules so that materials, parts, and supplies arrive 
when they are needed.
Today a popular extension of MRP is known as enterprise 
resource planning (ERP). The primary difference between ERP and 
MRP is that ERP software is more sophisticated and can monitor 
not only inventory and production processes but also quality, sales, 
and even such variables as inventory at a supplier’s location.
Because large firms can incur huge inventory costs, much atten-
tion has been devoted to inventory control. The just-in-time system 
being used by some businesses is one result of all this attention. A 
just-in-time inventory system is designed to ensure that materials 
or supplies arrive at a facility just when they are needed so that stor-
age and holding costs are minimized. The customer must specify what will be needed, 
when, and in what amounts. The supplier must be sure that the right supplies arrive at 
the agreed-upon time and location. For example, managers using a just-in-time inventory 
system at a Toyota assembly plant determine the number of automobiles that will be 
assembled in a specified time period. Then Toyota purchasing personnel order just the 
parts needed to produce those automobiles. In turn, suppliers deliver the parts in time or 
when they are needed on the assembly line.
Without proper inventory control, it is impossible for operations managers to 
schedule the work required to produce goods that can be sold to customers.
Scheduling
Scheduling is the process of ensuring that materials and other resources are at the right 
place at the right time. The materials and resources may be moved from a warehouse to 
the workstations, they may move from station to station along an assembly line, or they 
may arrive at workstations “just in time” to be made part of the work-in-process there.
As our definition implies, both place and time are important to scheduling. The 
routing of materials is the sequence of workstations that the materials will follow. 
Assume that Drexel-Heritage—one of America’s largest and oldest furniture manu-
facturers—is scheduling production of an oval coffee table made from cherry wood. 
Operations managers route the needed materials (wood, screws, packaging materials, 
etc.) through a series of individual workstations along an assembly line. At each work-
station, a specific task is performed, and then the partially finished coffee table moves 
to the next workstation. When routing materials, operations managers are especially 
concerned with the sequence of each step of the production process. For the coffee 
table, the top and legs must be cut to specifications before the wood is finished. (If the 
wood were finished before being cut, the finish would be ruined, and the coffee table 
would have to be stained again.)
When scheduling production, managers also are concerned with timing. The tim-
ing function specifies when the materials will arrive at each station and how long they 
will remain there. For the cherry coffee table, it may take workers 30 minutes to cut 
the table top and legs and another 30 minutes to drill the holes and assemble the table. 
Before packaging the coffee table for shipment, it must be finished with cherry stain

Tracking inventory can be a tedious, but 
necessary chore. For a wholesaler or retailer, running 
out of inventory means a business has nothing to sell. 
For a manufacturer, no inventory can lead to shutting 
down a production facility and no finished products. In 
either case, no inventory equals no sales and can lead 
to no profits.

Regardless of whether the finished product requires a simple or complex produc-
tion process, operations managers are responsible for monitoring schedules—called 
follow-up—to ensure that the work flows according to a timetable. For some products, 
operations managers often prefer to use Gantt charts or the PERT technique to sched-
ule production activities.
Scheduling Through Gantt Charts  Developed by Henry L. Gantt, a Gantt chart 
is a graphic scheduling device that displays the tasks to be performed on the vertical 
axis and the time required for each task on the horizontal axis. Gantt charts do the 
following:
●
●Allow you to determine how long a project should take.
●
●Lay out the order in which tasks need to be completed.
●
●Determine the resources needed.
●
●Monitor progress of different activities required to complete the project.
A Gantt chart that describes the activities required to build three dozen golf 
carts is illustrated in Figure 8.6. Gantt charts usually are not suitable for scheduling 
extremely complex situations. Nevertheless, using them forces a manager to plan the 
steps required to get a job done and to specify time requirements for each part of  
the job.
Scheduling via PERT  A technique for scheduling a complex project and maintain-
ing control of the schedule is PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique).
To use PERT, you begin by identifying all the major activities involved in the proj-
ect. For example, the activities involved in producing your textbook are illustrated in  
Figure 8.7.
All events are arranged in a sequence. In doing so, we must be sure that an event 
that must occur before another event in the actual process also occurs before that event 
on the PERT chart. The manuscript, for example, must be edited before the type is set. 
Next, we use arrows to connect events that must occur in sequence. We then estimate 
the time required for each activity and mark it near the corresponding arrow. The 
This chart details the job of building three dozen electric golf carts.

Malcolm Baldrige National 
Quality Award  an award given by 
the President of the United States 
to organizations judged to be 
outstanding in specific managerial 
tasks that lead to improved quality 
for both products and services
sequence of production activities that take the longest time from start to finish is called 
the critical path. The activities on this path determine the minimum time in which the 
process can be completed. These activities are the ones that must be scheduled and 
controlled carefully. A delay in any one of them will cause a delay in completion of the 
project as a whole.
Quality Control
Over the years, more and more managers have realized that quality is an essential 
“ingredient” of the good or service being produced. This view of quality provides 
several benefits. The number of defects decreases, which causes profits to increase. 
Furthermore, making products or completing services right the first time reduces many 
of the rejects and much of the rework.
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, American business firms 
that compete in the very competitive global marketplace have taken 
another look at the importance of improving quality. Today, there 
is even a national quality award. The Malcolm Baldrige National 
Quality Award is given by the President of the United States to 
organizations judged to be outstanding in specific managerial tasks 
that lead to improved quality for both products and services. Past 
winners include Ritz-Carlton Hotels, Boeing Aerospace, Motorola, 
Nestlé Purina Petcare, Cargill Corn Milling North America, and 
Richland Community College (part of the Dallas Community 
College District), among many others. For many organizations, 
using the Baldrige criteria results in
●
●better employee relations,
●
●higher productivity,
●
●greater customer satisfaction,
●
●increased market share, and
●
●improved profitability.18
All Baldrige winners have one factor in common: They use 
quality control to improve their firm’s products or services.

Part 3   Management and Organization
Quality control is the process of ensuring that goods and services are produced 
in accordance with design specifications. The major objective of quality control is 
to see that the organization lives up to the standards it has set for itself on quality. 
Some firms, such as Mercedes-Benz, have built their reputations on quality. Other 
firms adopt a strategy of emphasizing lower prices along with reasonable (but not 
particularly high) quality. Today, many firms use the techniques described in Table 8.1 
to gather information and statistics that can be used to improve the quality of a firm’s 
products or services. 
Although the techniques described in Table 8.1 can provide information and sta-
tistics, it is people who must act on the information and make changes to improve the 
production process. And the firm’s employees are often the most important component 
needed to improve quality.
Improving Quality Through Employee Participation  One of the first steps 
needed to improve quality is employee participation. Simply put: Successful firms 
encourage employees to accept full responsibility for the quality of their work. 
When Toyota, once the role model for world-class manufacturing, faced a quality 
crisis, the company announced a quality-improvement plan based on its famous 
“Toyota Way.” One tenet of the Toyota Way is the need to solve problems at their 
source, which allows factory workers to stop the production line if necessary to 
address a problem. Another tenet that enabled Toyota to resolve quality problems 
was the use of quality circles designated to deal with difficulties as they arise. A 
quality circle is a team of employees who meet on company time to solve problems 
of product quality. This level of employee participation allowed Toyota to correct 
the problems and improve the firm’s automobiles. Today, Toyota is once again rec-
ognized as one of the most reliable automobile brands. Quality circles have also 
been used successfully in companies such as IBM, Northrop Grumman Corporation, 
Lockheed Martin, and GE.
Increased effort is also being devoted to ­inspection, which is the examination of 
the quality of work-in-process. Employees perform inspections at various times during 
production. Purchased materials may be inspected when they arrive at the production 
facility. Subassemblies and manufactured parts may be inspected before they become 
part of a finished product. In addition, finished goods may be inspected before they are 
shipped to customers. Items that are within design specifications continue on their way. 
Those that are not within design specifications are removed from production.
Total quality management (TQM) can also be used to improve quality of a 
firm’s products or services. As noted in Chapter 6, a TQM program coordinates the 
efforts directed at improving customer satisfaction, increasing employee participation, 
strengthening supplier partnerships, and facilitating an organizational atmosphere of 
continuous quality improvement. Firms such as American Express, AT&T, Motorola,

Description
Benchmarking
A process of comparing the way a firm produces products or services to the methods 
used by organizations known to be leaders in an industry in order to determine the “best 
practices” that can be used to improve quality.
Continuous Improvement
Continuous improvement is a never-ending effort to eliminate problems and improve 
quality. Often this method involves many small changes or steps designed to improve the 
production process on an ongoing basis.
Statistical Process Control (SPC)
Sampling to obtain data that are plotted on control charts and graphs to see if the 
production process is operating as it should and to pinpoint problem areas.
Statistical Quality Control (SQC)
A detailed set of specific statistical techniques used to monitor all aspects of the production 
process to ensure that both work-in-process and finished products meet the firm’s quality 
standards.

product quality and, ultimately, customer satisfaction.
Another technique that businesses may use to 
improve not only quality but also overall performance is 
Six Sigma. Six Sigma is a disciplined approach that relies 
on statistical data and improved methods to eliminate 
defects for a firm’s products and services. Although many 
experts agree that Six Sigma is similar to TQM, Six Sigma 
often has more top-level support, much more teamwork, 
and a new corporate attitude or culture. The companies 
that developed, refined, and have the most experience with Six 
Sigma are Motorola, GE, and Honeywell. Although each of these 
companies is a corporate giant, the underlying principles of Six 
Sigma can be used by any firm, regardless of size.19
World Quality Standards: ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 
Without a common standard of quality, customers may be at the 
mercy of manufacturers and vendors. As the number of compa-
nies competing in the global marketplace has increased, so has 
the seriousness of this problem. To deal with the problem of stan-
dardization, the International Organization for Standardization, 
a nongovernmental organization with headquarters in Geneva, 
Switzerland, was created. The International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) is a network of national standards insti-
tutes and similar organizations from over 160 different countries 
that is charged with developing standards for quality products and 
services that are traded throughout the globe. According to the 
organization,
ISO’s work makes a positive difference to the world we live in. ISO standards add 
value to all types of business operations. They contribute to making the develop-
ment, manufacturing and supply of products and services more efficient, safer and 
cleaner. They make trade between countries easier and fairer. ISO standards also 
serve to safeguard consumers and users of products and services in general, as well 
as making their lives simpler.20
Standardization is achieved through consensus agreements between national del-
egations representing all the economic stakeholders—suppliers, customers, and often 
governments. The member organization for the United States is the American National 
Standards Institute located in Washington, D.C.
In 1987, the panel published ISO 9000 (iso is Greek for “equal”), which sets 
the guidelines for quality management procedures that manufacturers and service 
providers must use to receive certification. Certification by independent auditors 
and laboratory testing services serves as evidence that a company meets the stan-
dards for quality control procedures in design, production processes, and product 
testing.
Although certification is not a legal requirement to conduct business globally, the 
organization’s member countries have approved the ISO standards. In fact, ISO stan-
dards are so prevalent around the globe that many customers refuse to do business 
with noncertified companies. As an added bonus, companies completing the certification 
process often discover new, cost-efficient ways to improve their existing quality-control 
programs.
As a continuation of this standardization process, the International Organization 
for Standardization has developed ISO 14000. ISO 14000 is a family of international 
standards for incorporating environmental concerns into operations and product stan-
dards. Both the ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 family of standards are updated periodically. 
For example, ISO 9001:2008 includes important clarifications and addresses issues of 
compatibility with ISO’s other quality standards.

You don’t want to buy a shoddy product, and any 
company you work for doesn’t want to gain a reputation 
for poor quality. That’s why strict quality control is so 
important.

waste from all of the activities 
required to produce a product or 
service
Improving Productivity with Technology
No coverage of operations management would be complete without a discussion of 
productivity and technology. Productivity concerns all managers, but it is especially 
important to operations managers, the people who must oversee the creation of a firm’s 
goods or services. In Chapter 1, productivity was defined as the average level of output 
per worker per hour. Hence, if each worker at plant A produces 75 units per day and 
each worker at plant B produces only 70 units per day, the workers at plant A are more 
productive. If one bank teller serves 25 customers per hour and another serves 28 per 
hour, the second teller is more productive.
Productivity Trends
For U.S. businesses, overall productivity growth for output per hour averaged 
4.1 percent for the period 1979–2010.21 More specifically, 2010 output per hour for 
U.S. firms increased 5.8 percent.22 (Note: At the time of publication, 2010 was the last 
year that complete statistics were available.) While the 5.8 increase in output per hour 
in 2010 was impressive when compared with our average productivity growth, 12 
other nations that the U.S. Bureau Labor Statistics tracks each year had larger growth 
in productivity than the United States—as illustrated in Figure 8.8.23
Improving Productivity Growth
In an effort to improve productivity, an increasingly large number of business firms 
are adopting the concept of lean manufacturing. Lean manufacturing is a concept 
built on the idea of eliminating waste from all of the activities required to produce a 
product or service. Benefits of lean manufacturing include a reduction in the amount of 
resources required to produce a product or service, more efficient use of employee time, 
improved quality, and increased profits. In addition to lean manufacturing, several 
other factors must be considered if U.S. firms are going to increase productivity and 
their ability to compete in the global marketplace. For example:
●
●The United States must stabilize its economy so that firms will invest more money 
in new facilities, equipment, technology and employee training.

●
●Business firms must cooperate with employees to increase employee motivation 
and participation in the workplace.
●
●All government policies must be examined to ensure that unreasonable regulations 
that may be hindering productivity growth are eliminated.
●
●Successful techniques that have been used in manufacturing firms must be used to 
increase productivity in the service industry.
●
●Increased use of automation, robotics, and computer manufacturing systems must 
be used to lower production costs.
●
●There must be more emphasis on satisfying the customer’s needs with quality 
goods and services.
Finally, innovation and research and development efforts to create new prod-
ucts and services must be increased in order for U.S. firms to compete in the global 
marketplace.
The Impact of Automation, Robotics, 
and Computers on Productivity
Automation is the total or near-total use of machines to do work. The rapid increase 
in automated procedures has been made possible by the microprocessor, a silicon chip 
that led to the production of desktop computers for businesses, homes, and schools. 
In factories, microprocessors are used in robotics and in computer manufacturing 
systems.
Robotics  Robotics is the use of programmable machines to perform a variety 
of tasks by manipulating materials and tools. Robots work quickly, accurately, and 
steadily. For example, Illumina, Inc., a San Diego company, sells robotic equipment 
that performs medical laboratory tests. Available information then is sold to some of 
the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies where it is used to alter existing pre-
scription drugs, develop new drug therapies, and customize treatments for all kinds of 
serious diseases. As an added bonus, Illumina’s robotic equipment can work 24 hours 
a day at much lower costs than if human lab workers performed the same tests.24
Robots are especially effective in tedious, repetitive assembly-line jobs, as well 
as in handling hazardous materials. Lincoln Electric, for example, provides robotic 
arc welders that eliminate the hot, dirty job of welding, which is key to many 
manufacturing tasks. As an added bonus, robotic arc welders 
are often quicker and are more precise than old-fashioned weld-
ing machines. Robots are also useful as artificial “eyes” that can 
check the quality of products as they are being processed on 
assembly lines. To date, the automotive industry has made the 
most extensive use of robotics, but robots also have been used to 
mine coal, inspect the inner surfaces of pipes, assemble computer 
components, provide certain kinds of patient care in hospitals, 
and clean and guard buildings at night.
Computer Manufacturing Systems  People are quick to point 
out how computers have changed their everyday lives, but most 
people do not realize the impact computers have had on manu-
facturing. In simple terms, the factory of the future has already 
arrived. For most manufacturers, the changeover began with the 
use of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing. 
Computer-aided design (CAD) is the use of computers to aid in 
the development of products. Ford speeds up car design, Canon 
designs new photocopiers, and American Greetings creates new 
birthday cards by using CAD.
Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) is the use of comput-
ers to plan and control manufacturing processes. A well-designed

Robotics can be a manufacturer’s best friend. 
One of the first industries to use robotics to increase 
the number of products produced and improve 
employee productivity was the automobile industry. In 
this photo, robotics are used to move the right side of 
a sport utility vehicle (SUV) from one workstation on 
an assembly line to the next station.

Part 3   Management and Organization
computer-integrated 
manufacturing (CIM)  a computer 
system that not only helps to 
design products but also controls 
the machinery needed to produce 
the finished product
continuous process  a 
manufacturing process in which a 
firm produces the same product(s) 
over a long period of time

(FMS)  a single production system 
that combines electronic machines 
and computer-integrated 
manufacturing
intermittent process  a 
manufacturing process in which 
a firm’s manufacturing machines 
and equipment are changed to 
produce different products
CAM system allows manufacturers to become much more productive. Not only are 
a greater number of products produced, but speed and quality also increase. Using 
CAM systems, Toyota produces automobiles, Hasbro manufactures toys, and Apple 
Computer creates electronic products.
If you are thinking that the next logical step is to combine the CAD and CAM 
computer systems, you are right. Today, the most successful manufacturers use 
CAD and CAM together to form a computer-integrated manufacturing system. 
Specifically, computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) is a computer system 
that not only helps to design products but also controls the machinery needed to 
produce the finished product. For example, Fifth & Pacific Companies (formerly Liz 
Claiborne), uses CIM to design clothing, to establish patterns for new fashions, and 
then to cut the cloth needed to produce the finished product. Other advantages of 
using CIM include improved flexibility, more efficient scheduling, and higher prod-
uct quality—all factors that make a production facility more competitive in today’s 
global economy.
Flexible Manufacturing Systems  Manufacturers have known for a number of 
years that the mass-production and traditional assembly lines used to manufacture 
products present a number of problems. For example, although traditional assem-
bly lines turn out extremely large numbers of identical products economically, the 
system requires expensive, time-consuming retooling of equipment whenever a new 
product is to be manufactured. This type of manufacturing is often referred to as 
a continuous process. Continuous process is a manufacturing process in which a 
firm produces the same product(s) over a long period of time. Now it is possible to 
use flexible manufacturing systems to solve such problems. A flexible manufactur-
ing system (FMS) combines electronic machines and computer-integrated manu-
facturing in a single production system. Instead of having to spend large amounts 
of time and effort to retool the traditional mechanical equipment on an assembly 
line for each new product, an FMS is rearranged simply by reprogramming elec-
tronic machines. Because FMSs require less time and expense to reprogram than 
traditional systems, manufacturers can produce smaller batches of a variety of 
products without raising the production cost. Flexible manufacturing is sometimes 
referred to as an intermittent process. An intermittent process is a manufacturing 
process in which a firm’s manufacturing machines and equipment are changed to 
produce different products.
For most manufacturers, the driving force behind FMSs is the customer. In 
fact, the term customer-driven production is often used to describe a manufactur-
ing system that is driven by customer needs and what customers want to buy. For 
example, advanced software and a flexible manufacturing system have enabled Dell 
Computer to change to a more customer-driven manufacturing process. The process 
starts when a customer phones a sales representative on a toll-free line or accesses 
Dell’s Web site. Then the representative or the customer enters the specifications 
for the new product directly into a computer. The order then is sent to a nearby 
plant. Once the order is received, a team of employees, with the help of a repro-
grammable assembly line, can build the product just the way the customer wants 
it. Products include desktop computers, notebook computers, and other Dell equip-
ment. 25 Although the costs of designing and installing an FMS such as this are high, 
the electronic equipment is used more frequently and efficiently than the machinery 
on a traditional assembly line.
Sustainability and Technological Displacement
In Chapter 1, sustainability was defined as meeting the needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. While 
sustainability affects all aspects of a nation, its people, and the economy, the concept is 
especially important for manufacturers and service providers. Because of the amount 
of resources required to produce goods and services, these businesses must conserve

resources whenever possible. As an added bonus, efforts to reduce waste and sustain 
the planet can often improve a firm’s bottom-line profit amount.
In the future, most experts agree that, because U.S. manufacturers will continue to 
innovate, workers who have manufacturing jobs will be highly skilled and can work 
with the automated and computer-assisted manufacturing systems. Those that don’t 
possess high-tech skills will be dispensable and unemployed. Many workers will be 
faced with the choice of retraining for new jobs or seeking jobs in other sectors of 
the economy. Government, business, and education will have to cooperate to prepare 
workers for new roles in an automated workplace.
The next chapter discusses many of the issues caused by technological displace-
ment. In addition, a number of major components of human resources management 
are described, and we see how managers use various reward systems to boost motiva-
tion, productivity, and morale.

Business
Store shelves all over the world are packed with foods, 
skin-care products, household cleaners, and other con-
sumer products made by Unilever. In fact, more than two 
billion consumers in 190 countries use a Unilever product 
every day. Over the years, the company has been awarded 
20,000 patents to protect product innovations resulting 
from research conducted at its centers in Asia, Europe, 
and the Americas. Scientists, chemists, nutritionists, and 
other specialists work closely with market researchers, 
quality assurance experts, and safety professionals to 
create and refine new products and meet the everyday 
needs of consumers in the countries where Unilever does 
business.
Unilever has set goals for minimizing the environmen-
tal impact of its products at all stages, from sourcing raw 
materials to the production process to packaging and 
beyond. For example, as one of the world’s largest buyers 
of tea leaves, Unilever recognizes that if it can encour-
age customers to compost used teabags, they will keep 
thousands of tons of waste out of landfills and make the 
planet greener for future generations.
Questions
1.	 How do the concepts of focus, magnitude of change, 
and number of production processes, describe the 
way Unilever produces products?
2.	 Why would a large multinational company like 
Unilever with established products that consumers 
purchase on a regular basis continue to invest money 
in research and development?
Unilever
Explain the nature of production.
Operations management consists of all the activities that 
managers engage in to create goods and services. Operations 
are as relevant to service organizations as to manufacturing 
firms. Today, U.S. companies are forced to compete in an 
ever-smaller world to meet the needs of more-demanding 
customers. As a result, U.S. manufacturers have used 
innovation to improve productivity. Because of innovation, 
fewer workers are needed, but those workers who are 
needed possess the skills to use automation and technology. 
In an attempt to regain a competitive edge, manufacturers 
have taken another look at the importance of improving 
quality and meeting the needs of their customers. They also 
have used new techniques to motivate employees, reduced 
costs, used computer-aided and flexible manufacturing 
systems, improved control procedures, and used green 
manufacturing. Competing in the global economy is not 
only profitable but also an essential activity that requires 
the cooperation of everyone within an organization. A 
number of career options are available for employees in 
operations management.

Part 3   Management and Organization
Outline how the conversion process transforms 
raw materials, labor, and other resources into 
finished goods or services.
A business transforms resources into goods and services in 
order to provide utility to customers. Utility is the ability 
of a good or service to satisfy a human need. Form utility 
is created by people converting raw materials, finances, and 
information into finished products. Conversion processes 
vary in terms of the major resources used to produce 
goods and services (focus), the degree to which resources 
are changed (magnitude of change), and the number of 
production processes that a business uses.
Understand the importance of service businesses 
to consumers, other business firms, and the 
nation’s economy.
The application of the basic principles of operations 
management to the production of services has coincided 
with the growth and importance of service businesses in 
the United States. Today 87 percent of American workers 
are employed in the service industry. In fact, the American 
economy is now characterized as a service economy. For a 
service firm, planning often begins with determining who the 
customer is and what needs the customer has. After customer 
needs are identified the next step is to develop a plan that will 
enable the firm to deliver the services that their customers 
want or need. Although it is often more difficult to measure 
customer satisfaction, today’s successful service firms work 
hard at providing the services customers want. For example, 
compared with manufacturers, service firms often listen 
more carefully to customers and respond more quickly to 
the market’s changing needs.
Describe how research and development lead to 
new products and services.
Operations management often begins with product research 
and development and often referred to as R&D. The results 
of R&D may be entirely new products or services or 
extensions and refinements of existing products or services. 
R&D activities are classified as basic research (aimed at 
uncovering new knowledge), applied research (discovering 
new knowledge with some potential use), and development 
and implementation (using new or existing knowledge to 
produce goods and services). If a firm sells only one product 
or provides only one service, when that product or service 
reaches the end of its life-cycle, the firm will die, too. To stay 
in business, the firm must, at the very least, find ways to 
refine or extend the want-satisfying capability of its product 
or service.
Discuss the components involved in planning the 
production process.
Planning for production involves three major phases: 
design planning, site selection and facilities planning, and 
operational planning. First, design planning is undertaken 
to address questions related to the product line, required 
production capacity, and the use of technology. Then 
2
3
4

production facilities, human resources, and plant layout 
must be considered. Operational planning focuses on the 
use of production facilities and resources. The steps for 
operational planning include (1) selecting a planning horizon, 
(2) estimating market demand, (3) comparing market demand 
with capacity, and (4) adjusting production of products or 
services to meet demand.
Explain how purchasing, inventory control, 
scheduling, and quality control affect  
production.
The major areas of operations control are purchasing, 
inventory control, scheduling, and quality control. 
Purchasing involves selecting suppliers. The choice of 
suppliers should result from careful analysis of a number 
of factors, including price, quality, reliability, credit terms, 
and shipping costs. Inventory control is the management 
of stocks of raw materials, work-in-process, and finished 
goods to minimize the total inventory cost. Scheduling 
ensures that materials and other resources are at the right 
place at the right time. Both Gantt charts and PERT can be 
used to improve a firm’s ability to schedule the production 
of products. Quality control guarantees that products 
and services are produced in accordance with design 
specifications. The major objective of quality control is to 
see that the organization lives up to the standards it has set 
for itself on quality. A number of different activities can be 
used to improve quality.
Summarize how technology can make American 
firms more productive and competitive in the 
global marketplace.
Productivity is the average level of output per worker per 
hour. From 1979 to 2010, U.S. productivity growth averaged 
a 4.1 percent increase. More specifically, productivity in 2010 
increased 5.8 percent. Although a 5.8 percent was impressive 
when compared to our average productivity growth, 12 
other nations that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks 
each year had larger growth in productivity than the United 
States. Several factors must be considered if U.S. firms are 
going to increase productivity and their ability to compete in 
the global marketplace.
Automation, the total or near-total use of machines to 
do work, has for some years been changing the way work 
is done in factories. A growing number of industries are 
using programmable machines called robots. Computer-
aided design, computer-aided manufacturing, and com-
puter-integrated manufacturing use computers to help 
design and manufacture products. FMS combines elec-
tronic machines and computer-integrated manufacturing 
to produce smaller batches of products more efficiently 
than on the traditional assembly line. Instead of having to 
spend vast amounts of time and effort to retool the tradi-
tional mechanical equipment on an assembly line for each 
new product, an FMS is rearranged simply by reprogram-
ming electronic machines.

Part 3   Management and Organization
Chicago-based Boeing uses a combination of team-inspired inno-
vations and cutting-edge technology to make commercial jetlin-
ers at two plants in Washington state and one in South Carolina. 
The company rings up $68 billion in annual revenues and 
employs more than 170,000 employees in 70 nations. Because 
lives are at stake each time a plane takes off, quality is at the very 
top of Boeing’s agenda when it designs, tests, and manufactures 
its jetliners.
Boeing’s best-selling plane is the 737, which has been updated 
numerous times since it was first introduced in the late 1960s. 
More than 350 airlines now fly 737s, and the model is still in 
such demand that Boeing has orders to deliver another 2,600 
(priced at $59 million and up, depending on configuration). At 
Boeing’s 737 plant in Renton, Washington, employees with varied 
technical, engineering, and production backgrounds work in small 
teams to tackle challenges related to a specific part of the jetliner 
or the assembly process. These teams have found ingenious ways 
to improve productivity without expanding the facility or increas-
ing costs.
For example, when the jetliners are rolled along the factory 
floor during the final stages of assembly, stray fasteners or bolts 
occasionally poke holes in the tires. Counting materials and labor, 
the replacement cost of one tire is $10,000. To reduce the num-
ber of punctures, the team tried using specially shaped sweepers 
to move any fasteners out of the jetliner’s path. When that didn’t 
entirely solve the problem, a team member borrowed an idea he’d 
snowboard about 100 days of the year, sometimes to test new 
products, but sometimes just for fun. “There are a lot of vibrant 
folks [at the company] and it rubs off on you,” he says.
The company, which began as an entrepreneurial venture 
housed in a barn in 1977, now manufactures and sells snow-
boards with prices that range from $300 to $1,500. Jake, who 
says he was a failure in shop class while in school, handmade 
his own boards for a sport that had few followers and was yet 
unrecognized. Snowboarding has since come a long way, hav-
ing made its Olympic debut during the 1998 Winter Games at 
Nagano, Japan. Burton Snowboards has grown, too. With world 
headquarters in Burlington, the company operates a factory in 
Austria and stores in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Wrentham 
(MA), Orlando, and of course Burlington, as well as in Tokyo and 
Innsbruck (Austria). It also works with thousands of retail dealers 
in more than 30 countries around the world and offers products 
for sale online as well.
A major factor in the company’s success is the high-quality 
standards to which it has adhered from its very beginning. These 
have made Burton Snowboards a premium supplier whose name 
is synonymous with quality. Its snowboards are made to exacting 
specifications from wood, fiberglass, and steel (not cheaper foam 
materials), and with unrelenting attention to every step of pro-
duction, including the finishing details. “We don’t cut corners,” 
says a company spokesperson, though that sometimes means its 
products will cost a bit more than competitors’. The prevailing 
philosophy at the firm is that “you get what you pay for,” and by 
listening to its core customers, who fall between the ages of 12 
and 35 years old, Burton remains confident that its high stan-
dards meet the expectations of those for whom snowboarding is 
not just a sport but also a lifestyle. “We’ve always based our deci-
sions around snowboarders and what’s best for them,” says Jake.
Quality is further assured by the company’s policy of rede-
signing every product every year in order to retain its position as 
“an innovator, not an imitator” and to keep up with changing 
customers’ needs and desires as well as with competitors’ efforts 
to grow their own market share. One such threat comes from 
ski companies that have decided to move into the snowboarding 
industry. Burton’s managers credit much of the company’s suc-
cess to its ability to respond well to change. According to Jake, 
“As a company we’ve always thrived on opportunity.”
One new opportunity the firm faces is the need to control 
its production costs without sacrificing quality. Burton recently 
announced that it is closing its Burlington factory and will manu-
facture exclusively at the Austrian plant it has operated for the 
past 25 years. “It costs us significantly more to produce a board 
in Vermont than we are capable of selling it for,” a company 
statement said, “and sadly, this is not sustainable in the current 
economy.” Nearly 400 employees will remain at the Burlington 
facility, however, which has “excelled at prototyping and devel-
oping product” in the past and will still carry that responsibil-
ity. “Here in Vermont,” said the then-CEO, “we will continue to 
focus on advanced product development, which will allow us to 
bring the latest snowboard technology to riders faster than ever 
before.” As evidence of its commitment to maintaining its reputa-
tion as the best snowboard manufacturer in the world, Burton 
opened a new state-of-the-art prototype research facility named 
after world famous snowboarder Craig Kelly in 2011.26
Questions
1. About 40 people lost their jobs when Burton closed its 
Burlington manufacturing facility. How do you think the 
­factory closing might affect the productivity of the remaining 
headquarters staff? What impact could it have on product 
quality?
2. Do you think there will be an impact on quality when the 
design and development staff is separated from the factory 
floor by so many miles? Why or why not?
3. Can you reconcile the company’s focus on product quality 
with its decision to concentrate manufacturing in a place 
where it’s less expensive to operate? If so, how, and if not, 
why not?

seen at a motorcycle race: Put canvas covers on the tires, and 
take them off just before the race begins. Implementing this idea 
saved Boeing more than $200,000 per year in 737 tire replace-
ment costs.
Teams have come up with creative approaches to boost produc-
tivity all over the 737 plant. One team found a way to simultane-
ously prepare four engines for mounting in the same space where 
they formerly prepared three engines. Another team changed the 
sequence of tasks involved in painting parts, which saved at least 
10 minutes per employee per job. Yet another team determined 
that preassembling some groups of hydraulic tubes prior to instal-
lation in the wheel well would shave 30 hours off the time that 
skilled mechanics spent working on each 737. All these efficiencies 
add up: The plant can now assemble an entire 737 jetliner in fewer 
than 11 days, compared with 22 days just a decade ago.
Boeing’s newest jetliner, the 787 Dreamliner, is produced from 
high-tech, lightweight carbon composite materials in Everett, 
Washington, and North Charleston, South Carolina. When build-
ing the South Carolina factory, it used everything it had learned 
from 50 years of making jets. Inside the cavernous building, one 
787 jetliner at a time is assembled in the middle of five work-
stations. On-site factories build big sections of the fuselage as 
needed for each 787, which adds to the efficiency.
Despite careful planning, the fuel-efficient 787 is three years 
behind schedule because of problems with parts shortages and 
unforeseen design and assembly glitches. Boeing purchased some 
production operations of its South Carolina suppliers to gain 
direct control over this part of the supply chain. Now, with orders 
in hand for more than 850 Dreamliners, Boeing is working hard 
to increase monthly output to seven jetliners per month at the 
Everett plant and three jetliners per month at the South Carolina 
plant.27
Questions
1. Currently, Boeing has a big backlog of orders for both 737 
and 787 Dreamliner aircraft. How does the backlog affect 
its plans for production? What could the company do to 
increase production without sacrificing quality?
2. Do you agree that a just-in-time inventory system is appropri-
ate for Boeing’s 787 production? Explain your answer.
3. One production team suggested changing the sequence 
required to paint parts and saved 10 minutes per employee 
per job in the paint job. How do suggestions—even those 
that result in small improvements in the production process—
improve the company’s ability to meet customer demand, 
improve quality, and increase profits?
1  SOCIAL MEDIA EXERCISE
Starbucks has taken an innovative approach to improving their 
products and the customer experience in their stores. Their entire 
purpose is to create a “third place” beyond home and work where 
people can congregate and socialize (while having a nice cup of 
coffee). To engage customers, they created a Web site called My 
Starbucks Idea (http://mystarbucksidea.com) that allows custom-
ers to post their ideas and then allows customers to also vote on 
them. 
1. Visit the http://mystarbucksidea.com site. Do you have an 
idea for Starbucks? If so, post it. Do you have a feeling about 
one of the current ideas? If so, then vote for it.
2. Do you think this is an effective way to gain customer ideas 
for new products? Why or why not?
3. Can you think of other ways that corporate executives at 
Starbucks can gauge customer interest in their products and 
experience using social media?
2  JOURNALING FOR SUCCESS
Today, people purchase all kinds of products ranging from inexpen-
sive, everyday items to expensive, sophisticated products including 
electronics, automobiles, and even housing. In each case, custom-
ers like to think they are “getting their money’s worth” when they 
purchase a product or service.
Assignment
1. Describe a recent purchase that you made. Be sure to include 
the cost and why you made the purchase.
2. Given the cost of the product or service, were you satisfied? 
Why?
3. Do you think that the quality of this product or service was 
acceptable or unacceptable?
4. How could the manufacturer or provider of the service 
improve the quality of the product or service?
3  DEVELOPING CRITICAL-THINKING SKILLS
Plant layout—the arrangement of machinery, equipment, and per-
sonnel within a production facility—is a critical ingredient in a com-
pany’s success. If the layout is inefficient, productivity—and, ulti-
mately, profits—will suffer. The purpose of the business dictates the 
type of layout that will be most efficient. There are three general 
types: process layout, product layout, and fixed-position layout.
Assignment
1. For each of the following businesses, identify the best type of 
layout:

4  BUILDING TEAM SKILLS
Suppose that you are planning to build a house in the country. It 
will be a brick, one-story structure of approximately 2,000 square 
feet, centrally heated and cooled. It will have three bedrooms, 
two bathrooms, a family room, a dining room, a kitchen with a 
breakfast nook, a study, a utility room, an entry foyer, a two-car 
garage, a covered patio, and a fireplace. Appliances will operate on 
electricity and propane fuel. You have received approval and can be 
connected to the cooperative water system at any time. Public sew-
erage services are not available; therefore, you must rely on a septic 
system. You want to know how long it will take to build the house.
Assignment
1. Identify the major activities involved in the project and 
sequence them in the proper order.
2. Estimate the time required for each activity.
3. Working in a group, prepare a PERT diagram to show the 
steps involved in building your house.
4. Present your PERT diagram to the class and ask for comments 
and suggestions.
5  RESEARCHING DIFFERENT CAREERS
Because service businesses are now such a dominant part of 
our economy, job seekers sometimes overlook the employment 
opportunities available in production. Two positions often found 
in these plants are quality-control inspector and purchasing 
agent.
Assignment
1. Using the Occupational Outlook Handbook at your local library or 
on the Internet (http://stats.bls.gov/oco/home.htm), find the 
following information for the jobs of quality-control inspector 
and purchasing agent:
 
Nature of work, including main activities and responsibilities
 
Job outlook
 
Earnings
 
Training, qualifications, and advancement.
2. Look for other production jobs that may interest you and 
compile the same sort of information about them.
3. Summarize in a two-page report the key things you learned 
about jobs in production.
Graeter’s began as a tiny Cincinnati business and now enjoys 
a national reputation for the quality of its premium ice cream. 
Even though the $30 million company recently opened a new 
factory to support its expansion plans, it still clings fiercely to its 
original small-batch production method for making creamy ice 
cream from fresh ingredients. CEO Richard Graeter emphasizes 
that profits are important, but “staying true to who you are and 
investing in your business is what makes sure that your business is 
going to be here tomorrow.” That’s why Graeter’s still makes all 
of its ice cream by hand, ensuring that the texture and taste meet 
its high standards batch after batch, year after year. 
MORE THAN A FAMILY AFFAIR
Graeter’s top-management team includes the CEO and his two 
cousins, Bob and Chip Graeter. As vice president of operations, 
Bob is responsible for manufacturing, as well as for developing 
new products and finding suppliers to provide ingredients such 
as fresh fruits, cream, eggs, and chocolates. His brother Chip 
oversees all of the company’s ice cream shops. Rounding out the 
management team is a chief operating officer, a controller, a vice 
president of sales and marketing, and a candy production man-
ager. 
“Every major decision, we make on a consensus basis,” 
Richard says, describing the equal partnership among the 
three family members. “That doesn’t mean we don’t have a 
different point of view from time to time, but. . . we learn 
to see each other’s view and discuss, debate, and get down 
to a decision that all of us support. The other thing that we 
have learned to do, something that is a little different than 
our parents’ generation [did], is bring in outside people into 
the. . . executive level of the management team. . . . We now 
work with a couple of consultants to help us plan our strategy 
to look for a new vision, to develop training programs. . . all 
those systems that big companies have.” Managers stay in 
close contact with employees at all levels and don’t hesitate 
to ask for their input when solving problems and making deci-
sions.

INSIDE THE ORG CHART
Graeter’s formalized its organization structure over the years as it 
opened more stores and expanded beyond Cincinnati. Today, the 
store managers report to a group manager, who in turn reports to 
the vice president of retail operations. At the company’s recently 
opened 28,000 square foot production facility, employees in each 
of three shifts are supervised by a shift manager, who reports 
to the vice president of operations. The first and third shifts are 
responsible for ice cream production, while the second shift is in 
charge of cleaning and sanitizing the facility. 
 Because so many Graeter’s stores are located miles from 
headquarters, two managers “shop” each store every month, 
checking on quality and service. These management visits are 
supplemented by two monthly visits from “mystery shoppers” 
who buy ice cream on different days, observing what employ-
ees are doing and taking note of what else is happening in the 
store. Their written reports give Graeter’s top managers another 
view of the business, this time from the customer’s perspective.
WHAT’S THE PLAN?
Change has come quickly to Graeter’s, not all of it anticipated. 
The company was constructing its second factory to support the 
drive for nationwide distribution when an unexpected opportunity 
arose: to buy out the last franchise company operating Graeter’s 
retail stores and take over its factory as well. The management 
team jumped at the chance. “A few months ago our strategy was 
just operate one plant,” says Richard. “Now our strategy is, adapt 
to the opportunity that came along. . . we are operating three 
plants. The goal is to keep all of your assets deployed produc-
tively, so if we have these three plants, what is the most we can 
do out of those plants to be generating product and profit? One 
example would be supplying restaurants in other cities, which we 
really weren’t considering originally because our new plant was 
really geared for pints, but if we have this excess capacity, the 
smart thing to do is figure out what we can do with that.” 
 The newest Graeter’s facility, on Regina Graeter Way in 
Cincinnati, was built to produce as much as 1 million gal-
lons of ice cream per year, although the current annual output 
is about 625,000 gallons. Many steps, such as putting lids 
on packages and moving them into refrigerated storage, are 
handled by automated equipment. Yet all of the ice cream is 
still made in small batches and by hand. Experienced techni-
cians wield a paddle to gradually mix in ingredients such as 
molten chocolate, which have been pasteurized on the premises 
to comply with government regulations. Once the ice cream 
reaches the right temperature and texture, another employee 
hand-packs it into individual packages, which are then auto-
matically capped, stamped with a date code, sealed, and 
whisked away to be kept cold until being loaded onto trucks 
for delivery to supermarket customers. Ice cream samples from 
every shift’s output are tested to ensure purity and quality.
 Graeter’s sets weekly and monthly sales goals for its stores, 
based on each unit’s location and other factors that affect 
demand. If a store doesn’t meet its goals, the group man-
ager acts quickly to find out why and help the store get back 
on track. As the company explores the possibility of opening 
Graeter’s stores as far away as Los Angeles and New York, 
the management team is planning carefully and assessing the 
potential challenges and advantages of coast-to-coast opera-
tions.28
Questions
 1. Based on this case and the two previous Graeter’s cases, 
what are the company’s most important strengths? Can you 
identify any weaknesses that might affect its ability to grow? 
 2. How would you describe the departmentalization and the 
organizational structure at Graeter’s? Do you think Graeter’s 
is centralized or decentralized, and what are the implications 
for its plans for growth?
 3. The newest Graeter’s plant can produce far more ice cream 
than is needed today. The company also makes ice cream at 
its original plant and at the plant formerly owned by a fran-
chisee. What are the implications for Graeter’s strategy and 
for its operational planning? 
Now you should be ready to provide evidence that you have a man-
agement team with the necessary skills and experience to execute 
your business plan successfully. Only a competent management 
team can transform your vision into a successful business. You also 
should be able to describe your manufacturing and operations plans. 
The three chapters in Part 3 of your textbook, “Understanding the 
Management Process,” “Creating a Flexible Organization,” and 
“Producing Quality Goods and Services,” should help you in answer-
ing some of the questions in this part of the business plan.
THE MANAGEMENT TEAM COMPONENT
The management team component should include the answers to 
at least the following questions:
3.1 How is your team balanced in technical, conceptual, inter-
personal, and other special skills needed in your business?
3.2 What will be your style of leadership?
3.3 How will your company be structured? Include a statement 
of the philosophy of management and company culture.
3.4 What are the key management positions, compensation, and 
key policies?
3.5 Include a job description for each management position and 
specify who will fill that position. Note: Prepare an organiza-
tion chart and provide the résumé of each key manager for 
the appendix.

THE MANUFACTURING AND 
OPERATIONS PLAN COMPONENT
If you are in a manufacturing business, now is a good time to 
describe your manufacturing and operations plans, space require-
ments, equipment, labor force, inventory control, and purchasing 
requirements. Even if you are in a service-oriented business, many 
of these questions still may apply.
The manufacturing and operations plan component should 
include the answers to at least the following questions:
3.7 What are the advantages and disadvantages of your planned 
location in terms of
●
●
Wage rates
●
●
Unionization
●
●
Labor pool
●
●
Proximity to customers and suppliers
●
●
Types of transportation available
●
●
Tax rates
●
●
Utility costs
●
●

Companies and Job Candidates Get LinkedIn
Are you LinkedIn? LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com) is a professionals’ social media site, an 
online place where businesspeople in nearly every industry can network with their peers, 
showcase their credentials, research potential employers, and explore career possibilities. 
In today’s wired world, companies are increasingly reaching out to job-seekers through 
technology. Because LinkedIn has more than 150 million members in 200 nations, it has 
become a key hub for many firms’ online recruitment activities. 
For example, member companies pay to search for job candidates through LinkedIn’s 
listings and post open positions. FedEx created a Careers Connections group on LinkedIn 
to network with experienced professionals seeking to change jobs and with college students 
interested in learning about career opportunities. FedEx also pays to advertise jobs so that 
LinkedIn members with the right qualifications see the ads when they visit the site. LinkedIn 
itself maintains a careers page on the site, filled with information about the benefits of 
working for LinkedIn, job postings, testimonials from people who were recently hired, and 
direct links to the company’s recruiters.
Multinational corporations find LinkedIn an efficient way to recruit in multiple regions. 
Invensys, a London-based company that makes electronic controls for factories, power 
plants, and transit systems, has used LinkedIn to attract applicants for jobs in Kazakhstan, 
Slovakia, and Nigeria. Even for companies that hire locally, LinkedIn is supplementing tra-
ditional recruiting methods. When the biochemicals firm AMRESCO schedules a job fair 
in its home state of Ohio, its 250 employees post the place, date, and time to alert their 
LinkedIn member networks. Now one-third of AMRESCO’s new hires come through refer-
rals from employees who are LinkedIn members.
When the software developer Softchoice wants to hire professionals for its Toronto 
office, its recruiters sift through LinkedIn membership profiles to identify individuals with 
the relevant skills and experience. Then the recruiters contact these people, often via a 
LinkedIn message, to initiate a conversation about open positions. This allows Softchoice 
to expand its pool of candidates by reaching out to people who are not actively seeking to 
change jobs—yet.1

LinkedIn has more than 150

L
inkedIn has become an important tool for job seekers and professionals alike, 
as it allows firms to recruit and individuals to post and share their résumés and 
professional experiences online. We begin our study of human resources manage-
ment (HRM) with an overview of how businesses acquire, maintain, and develop their 
human resources. After listing the steps by which firms match their human resources 
needs with the supply available, we explore several dimensions of cultural diversity. 
Then we examine the concept of job analysis. Next, we focus on a firm’s recruiting, 
selection, and orientation procedures as the means of acquiring employees. We also 
describe forms of employee compensation that motivate employees to remain with a 
firm and to work effectively. Then we discuss methods of employee training, manage-
ment development, and performance appraisal. Finally, we consider legislation that 
affects HRM practices.

in acquiring, maintaining, and 
developing an organization’s 
human resources
Human Resources Management: 
An Overview
The human resource is not only unique and valuable but also an organization’s 
most important resource. It seems logical that an organization would expend a 
great deal of effort to acquire and make full use of such a resource. This effort 
is known as human resources management. It also has been called staffing and 
personnel management.
Human resources management (HRM) consists of all the activities involved 
in acquiring, maintaining, and developing an organization’s human resources. As the 
definition implies, HRM begins with acquisition—getting people to work for the orga-
nization. The acquisition process can be quite competitive for certain types of qualified 
employees. Next, steps must be taken to keep these valuable resources. (After all, they 
are the only business resources that can leave an organization.) Finally, the human 
resources should be developed to their full capacity.
HRM Activities
Each of the three phases of HRM—acquiring, maintaining, and developing human 
resources—consists of a number of related activities. Acquisition, for example, includes 
planning, as well as the various activities that lead to hiring new personnel. Altogether 
this phase of HRM includes five separate activities:
●
●Human resources planning—determining the firm’s future human resources needs
●
●Job analysis—determining the exact nature of the positions
●
●Recruiting—attracting people to apply for positions
●
●Selection—choosing and hiring the most qualified applicants
●
●Orientation—acquainting new employees with the firm
Maintaining human resources consists primarily of encouraging employees to 
remain with the firm and to work effectively by using a variety of HRM programs, 
including the following:
●
●Employee relations—increasing employee job satisfaction through satisfaction sur-
veys, employee communication programs, exit interviews, and fair treatment
●
●Compensation—rewarding employee effort through monetary 
payments
●
●Benefits—providing rewards to ensure employee well-being
The development phase of HRM is concerned with improving 
employees’ skills and expanding their capabilities. The two impor-
tant activities within this phase are:
●
●Training and development—teaching employees new skills, 
new jobs, and more effective ways of doing their present jobs
●
●Performance appraisal—assessing employees’ current and 
potential performance levels
These activities are discussed in more detail shortly, when we 
have completed this overview of HRM.
Responsibility for HRM
In general, HRM is a shared responsibility of line managers 
and staff HRM specialists. In very small organizations, the 
owner handles all or most HRM activities. As a firm grows 
in size, a human resources manager is hired to take over staff 
responsibilities. In firms as large as Disney, HRM activities tend 
to be very highly specialized. There are separate groups to

The power of people. Many firms believe their 
employees  are their most important assets. However, 
unlike other assets such as machinery, capital, 
and products, employees can pick up and leave an 
organization. Carefully designing compensation and 
reward packages can help a firm attract and retain 
valuable employees.

human resources planning  the 
development of strategies to meet 
a firm’s future human resources 
needs
deal with compensation, benefits, training and 
development, and other staff activities. GE, for 
example, has many divisions and offices all over 
the world. Because of the size and complexity of 
the organization, GE has hundreds of different HR 
managers to cover different geographic areas and 
departments within the firm.2
Specific HRM activities are assigned to those 
who are in the best position to perform them. 
Human resources planning and job analysis usually 
are done by staff specialists, with input from line manag-
ers. Similarly, recruiting and selection are handled by staff 
experts, although line managers are involved in hiring 
decisions. Orientation programs are devised by staff 
specialists and carried out by both staff specialists and line 
managers. Compensation systems (including benefits) most 
often are developed and administered by the HRM staff. 
However, line managers recommend pay increases and pro-
motions. Training and development activities are the joint 
responsibility of staff and line managers. Performance 
appraisal is the job of the line manager, although HRM 
personnel design the firm’s appraisal system in many 
organizations.
Human Resources Planning
Human resources planning is the development of strategies to meet a firm’s future 
human resources needs. The starting point is the organization’s overall strategic plan. 
From this, human resources planners can forecast future demand for human resources. 
Next, the planners must determine whether the needed human resources will be 
available. Finally, they have to take steps to match supply with demand.
Forecasting Human Resources Demand
Planners should base forecasts of the demand for human resources on as much relevant 
information as available. The firm’s overall strategic plan will provide information about 
future business ventures, new products, and projected expansions or contractions of 
specific product lines. Information on past staffing levels, evolving technologies, industry 
staffing practices, and projected economic trends also can be helpful. Technological 
advances are creating new opportunities in forecasting and planning for human resources 
demand. A survey released by Deloitte Consulting found that new technologies such 
as social media, cloud computing, and analytics have increased the speed of doing 
business, which increases the importance of international growth and strong leadership 
in organizations. Firms must hire HR talent that is fluent in using these new technologies 
in order to take advantage of opportunities and be aware of threats.3
HRM managers use this information to determine both the number of employees 
required and their qualifications. Planners use a wide range of methods to forecast spe-
cific personnel needs. For example, with one simple method, personnel requirements 
are projected to increase or decrease in the same proportion as sales revenue. Thus, if 
a 30 percent increase in sales volume is projected over the next two years, then up to 
a 30 percent increase in personnel requirements may be expected for the same period. 
(This method can be applied to specific positions as well as to the workforce in gen-
eral. It is not, however, a very precise forecasting method.) At the other extreme are 
elaborate, computer-based personnel planning models used by some large firms such as 
ExxonMobil Corporation.

Forecasting Human Resources Supply
The forecast of the supply of human resources must take into account both the 
present workforce and any changes that may occur within it. For example, suppose 
that planners project that in five years a firm that currently employs 100 engineers 
will need to employ a total of 200 engineers. Planners simply cannot assume that 
they will have to hire 100 engineers; during that period, some of the firm’s present 
engineers are likely to be promoted, leave the firm, or move to other jobs within the 
firm. Thus, planners may project the supply of engineers in five years at 87, which 
means that the firm will have to hire a total of 113 new engineers. When forecasting 
supply, planners should analyze the organization’s existing employees to determine 
who can be retrained to perform the required tasks.
Two useful techniques for forecasting human resources supply are the replacement 
chart and the skills inventory. A replacement chart is a list of key personnel and 
their possible replacements within a firm. The chart is maintained to ensure that top-
management positions can be filled fairly quickly in the event of an unexpected death, 
resignation, or retirement. Some firms also provide additional training for employees 
who might eventually replace top managers.
A skills inventory is a computerized data bank containing information on the 
skills and experience of all present employees. It is used to search for candidates to fill 
available positions. For a special project, a manager may be seeking a current employee 
with specific information technology skills, at least six years of experience, and fluency 
in French. The skills inventory can quickly identify employees who possess such quali-
fications. Skill-assessment tests can be administered inside an organization, or they can 
be provided by outside vendors. Some companies, such as eSkill, offer customizable 
skills assessment and training software that allows firms to more expertly examine 
skills without contracting with an outside provider.4
Matching Supply with Demand
Once they have forecasted the supply and demand for personnel, planners can devise 
a course of action for matching the two. When demand is predicted to be greater 
than supply, they must make plans to recruit new employees. The timing of these 
actions depends on the types of positions to be filled. Suppose that we expect 
to open another plant in five years that will need, along with other employees, 
a plant manager and 25 maintenance workers. We probably can wait quite a 
while before we begin to recruit maintenance personnel. However, because the 
job of a plant manager is so critical, we may start searching for the right person 
for that position immediately.
When supply is predicted to be greater than demand, the firm must take 
steps to reduce the size of its workforce. When the oversupply is expected to be 
temporary, some employees may be laid off—dismissed from the workforce until 
they are needed again.
Perhaps the most humane method for making personnel cutbacks is through 
attrition. Attrition is the normal reduction in the workforce that occurs when 
employees leave a firm. The U.S. Postal Service, in order to become leaner and 
more competitive with other delivery services, aims to cut its 650,000-person 
workforce by 100,000 in upcoming years, mostly by attrition as people retire or 
find other jobs. Most stakeholders believe this is a necessary move as the USPS 
runs a $1 billion-a-month deficit and customer numbers are low.5
Early retirement is another option. Under early retirement, people who are 
within a few years of retirement are permitted to retire early with full benefits. 
Depending on the age makeup of the workforce, this may or may not reduce the 
staff enough.
As a last resort, unnecessary employees are sometimes simply fired. However, 
because of its negative impact, this method generally is used only when absolutely 
necessary.

The demand for labor versus its 
supply: A balancing act. The supply 
and demand for employees with 
different skills is constantly shifting. 
In some industries, qualified workers 
are plentiful. In others, they are 
hard to find, even when the nation’s 
unemployment rate is high.

cultural (workplace) 
diversity  differences among 
people in a workforce owing to 
race, ethnicity, and gender
Cultural Diversity in Human Resources
Today’s workforce is made up of many types of people. Firms can no longer assume 
that every employee has similar beliefs or expectations. Whereas North American 
white males may believe in challenging authority, Asians tend to respect and defer to 
it. In Hispanic cultures, people often bring music, food, and family members to work, 
a custom that U.S. businesses traditionally have not allowed. A job applicant who will 
not make eye contact during an interview may be rejected for being unapproachable, 
when, according to his or her culture, he or she was just being polite.
Because a larger number of women, minorities, and immigrants have entered the U.S. 
workforce, the workplace is more diverse. It is estimated that women make up about 
47 percent of the U.S. workforce; African Americans and Hispanics each make up about 
12 and 15 percent of U.S. workers, respectively.6 Increasingly, women are taking more 
white-collar jobs than men in the United States; women represent more than half of col-
lege graduates. After the most recent recession, women fared better than men in terms 
of employment. Male employment fell 3.8%, while female employment only fell 1.8%.7
Cultural (or workplace) diversity refers to the differences among people in a 
workforce owing to race, ethnicity, and gender. Increasing cultural diversity is forcing 
managers to learn to supervise and motivate people with a broader range of value sys-
tems. The high proportion of women in the workforce, combined with a new emphasis 
on participative parenting by men, has brought many family-related issues to the work-
place. Today’s more educated employees also want greater independence and flexibility. 
In return for their efforts, they want both compensation and a better quality of life.
Although cultural diversity presents a challenge, managers should view it as an 
opportunity rather than a limitation. When managed properly, cultural diversity 
can provide advantages for an organization. Table 9.1 shows several benefits that

challenges and opportunities 
associated with it.

Table 9.1	
Advantages of Cultural Diversity
Economic Measure
Description
Cost
As organizations become more diverse, the cost of doing a poor job of integrating workers will 
increase. Companies that handle this well thus can create cost advantages over those that do a 
poor job. In addition, companies also experience cost savings by hiring people with knowledge of 
various cultures as opposed to having to train Americans, for example, about how Germans do 
business.
Resource 
acquisition
Companies develop reputations as being favorable or unfavorable prospective employers for 
women and ethnic minorities. Those with the best reputations for managing diversity will win the 
competition for the best personnel.
Marketing edge
For multinational organizations, the insight and cultural sensitivity that members with roots in 
other countries bring to marketing efforts should improve these efforts in important ways. The 
same rationale applies to marketing subpopulations domestically.
Flexibility
Culturally diverse employees often are open to a wider array of positions within a 
company and are more likely to move up the corporate ladder more rapidly, given excellent 
performance.
Creativity
Diversity of perspectives and less emphasis on conformity to norms of the past should improve 
the level of creativity.
Problem solving
Differences within decision-making and problem-solving groups potentially produce better 
decisions through a wider range of perspectives and more thorough critical analysis of issues.
Bilingual skills
Cultural diversity in the workplace brings with it bilingual and bicultural skills, which are very 
advantageous to the ever-growing global marketplace. Employees with knowledge about how 
other cultures work not only can speak to them in their language but also can prevent their 
company from making embarrassing moves owing to a lack of cultural sophistication. Thus, 
companies may seek job applicants with a background in cultures in which the company does 
business.

What Does a Chief Diversity Officer Do?
At Sodexho, the CDO is applying diversity principles to its 
suppliers as well as to its workforce, so the company can better 
serve customers in the food and facilities management industry. 
A Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Board identifies diversity 
trends that affect Sodexho and represents the company in 
its communities. American Express’s CDO has implemented 
a series of leadership and mentoring programs to improve 
diversity at the senior management level. And, like Sodexho, 
American Express looks beyond its workforce to promote “a 
supplier base that is reflective of our diverse customer base, 
employees, and shareholders.”

creative management of cultural diversity can offer. A firm that manages diversity 
properly can develop cost advantages over other firms. Moreover, organizations that 
manage diversity creatively are in a much better position to attract the best person-
nel. A culturally diverse organization may gain a marketing edge because it under-
stands different cultural groups. Proper guidance and management of diversity in an 
organization also can improve the level of creativity. People who embrace cultural 
diversity frequently are more flexible in the types of positions they will accept and 
are more comfortable working with culturally diverse co-workers.
Because cultural diversity creates challenges along with 
advantages, it is important for an organization’s employees to 
understand it. To accomplish this goal, numerous U.S. firms 
have trained their managers to respect and manage diversity. 
Diversity training programs may include recruiting minori-
ties, training minorities to be managers, training managers to 
view diversity positively, teaching English as a second language, 
and facilitating support groups for immigrants. Many com-
panies are realizing the necessity of having diversity training 
span beyond just racial issues. For example, companies such as 
PricewaterhouseCoopers and Sodexo require annual diversity 
training and use company-sanctioned global employee-resource 
groups.8 Companies such as these are continuously expanding 
their business worldwide and therefore need to meld a cohesive 
workforce from a labor pool whose demographics are constantly 
becoming more diverse.
A diversity program will be successful only if it is system-
atic, is ongoing, and has a strong, sustained commitment from 
top leadership. Cultural diversity is here to stay. Its impact on 
organizations is widespread and will continue to grow within 
corporations. Management must learn to overcome the obstacles 
and capitalize on the advantages associated with culturally diverse 
human resources.

Why hiring a diverse group of employees can 
benefit your business. Organizations that hire 
diverse types of employees benefit from their different 
skills and life experiences. The different points of 
view of these workers can help a firm find new 
opportunities and ways of doing things. In addition, 
diverse employees often have a greater understanding 
of  diverse customers and the goods and services they 
prefer.

Job Analysis
There is no sense in hiring people unless we know what we are hiring them for. In other 
words, we need to know the nature of a job before we can find the right person to do it.
Job analysis is a systematic procedure for studying jobs to determine their various 
elements and requirements. Consider the position of a clerk, for example. In a large 
corporation, there may be 50 kinds of clerk positions. They all may be called “clerks,” 
but each position may differ from the others in the activities performed, the level of 
proficiency required for each activity, and the particular set of qualifications that the 
position demands. These distinctions are the focus of job analysis. HRTMS is a leader 
in job description management. The company recently unveiled the Job Description 
Project, which combines one-on-one consulting, online support, with access to HRTMS 
programs that help craft job descriptions and ensure that they are in compliance with 
existing laws and regulations.9
The job analysis for a particular position typically consists of two parts—a job 
description and a job specification. A job description is a list of the elements that 
make up a particular job. It includes the duties to be performed, the working condi-
tions, the responsibilities, and the tools and equipment that must be used on the job 
(see Figure 9.1).
A job specification is a list of the qualifications required to perform a particular 
job, such as certain skills, abilities, education, and experience. When attempting to 
hire a financial analyst, the Bank of America might use the following job specifi-

recruiting  the process of 
attracting qualified job applicants
external recruiting  the attempt 
to attract job applicants from 
outside an organization
(individually and as a member of a team), positive attitude, high energy level and abil-
ity to influence others.”
The job analysis is not only the basis for recruiting and selecting new employees; 
it is also used in other areas of HRM, including evaluation and the determination of 
equitable compensation levels.
Recruiting, Selection, and Orientation
In an organization with jobs waiting to be filled, HRM personnel need to (1) find 
candidates for the jobs and (2) match the right candidate with each job. Three activities 
are involved: recruiting, selection, and new employee orientation.
Recruiting
Recruiting is the process of attracting qualified job applicants. Because it is a vital link 
in a costly process (the cost of hiring an employee can be several thousand dollars), 
recruiting needs to be a systematic process. One goal of recruiters is to attract the “right 
number” of applicants. The right number is enough to allow a good match between 
applicants and open positions but not so many that matching them requires too much 
time and effort. For example, if there are five open positions and five applicants, the 
firm essentially has no choice. It must hire those five applicants (qualified or not), or 
the positions will remain open. At the other extreme, if several hundred job seekers 
apply for the five positions, HRM personnel will have to spend weeks processing their 
applications.
Recruiters may seek applicants outside the firm, within the firm, or both. The 
source used depends on the nature of the position, the situation within the firm, and 
sometimes the firm’s established or traditional recruitment policies.
External Recruiting  External recruiting is the attempt to attract job applicants 
from outside an organization. External recruiting may include recruiting via newspaper 
advertising, employment agencies, and online employment organizations; recruiting 
on college campuses; soliciting recommendations from present employees; and con-
ducting “open houses.” Increasingly, people utilize the Internet to conduct their job 
searches. Social networking sites like LinkedIn or TweetMyJobs help match employ-
ers with interested potential employees. Online job search sites, like Monster.com or 
MediaBistro, help job seekers search for jobs by a variety of criteria 
like location and industry.10
Clearly, it is best to match the recruiting means with the kind 
of applicant being sought. Technology is helping organizations with 
this matching process. TweetMyJobs, a more recent addition to the 
social networking HRM arsenal, is a new means of matching job 
seekers with available positions. It is a service that alerts people 
via Twitter when a job opens up for which they are qualified. Web 
sites like LinkedIn allow employees to post their résumés, skills, 
and experiences; and employers can search for qualified employees. 
Technologies like these allow employers and employees to more 
easily locate positions that are a good fit.11
External recruiting has both advantages and disadvantages. A 
primary advantage of external recruiting is that it brings in people 
with new perspectives and varied business backgrounds. Some 
firms prefer to hire recruits directly out of college because they 
believe that these candidates will be more trainable to fit with the 
corporate culture and the needs of the company. An additional 
benefit of hiring younger talent is that they tend to be more techno-
logically savvy than their older counterparts, a characteristic that is 
highly desirable in today’s fast-moving workplace. A disadvantage

Potential employees are being recruited in increasingly 
different ways today. Companies often keep statistics 
on their recruiting sources so they can determine which 
methods are the best for finding good employees.

internal recruiting  considering 
present employees as applicants 
for available positions
selection  the process of 
gathering information about 
applicants for a position and then 
using that information to choose 
the most appropriate applicant
of external recruiting is that it is often expensive, especially if private employment 
agencies must be used. External recruiting also may provoke resentment among pres-
ent employees.
Internal Recruiting  Internal recruiting means considering present employees as 
applicants for available positions. Generally, current employees are considered for pro-
motion to higher-level positions. However, employees may be considered for transfer 
from one position to another at the same level. Among leading companies, 85 percent 
of CEOs are promoted from within. In the companies that hire CEOs from outside, 60 
to 80 percent of the CEOs are gone after 18 months.12
Promoting from within provides strong motivation for current employees and 
helps the firm to retain quality personnel. General Electric and ExxonMobil are com-
panies dedicated to promoting from within. The practice of job posting, or informing 
current employees of upcoming openings, may be a company policy or required by 
union contract. The primary disadvantage of internal recruiting is that promoting a 
current employee leaves another position to be filled. Not only does the firm still incur 
recruiting and selection costs, but it also must train two employees instead of one.
In many situations it may be impossible to recruit internally. For example, a new posi-
tion may be such that no current employee is qualified, or the firm may be growing so 
rapidly that there is no time to reassign positions that promotion or transfer requires.
Selection
Selection is the process of gathering information about applicants for a position 
and then using that information to choose the most appropriate applicant. Note the 
use of the word appropriate. In selection, the idea is not to hire the person with the 
most qualifications but rather the applicant who is most appropriate. The selection 
of an applicant is made by line managers responsible for the position. However, 
HRM personnel usually help by developing a pool of applicants and by expediting 
the assessment of these applicants. Common means of obtaining information about 
applicants’ qualifications are employment applications, interviews, references, and 
assessment centers.
Employment Applications  An employment application is useful in collecting fac-
tual information on a candidate’s education, work experience, and personal history 
(see Figure 9.2). The data obtained from applications usually are used for two pur-
poses: to identify applicants who are worthy of further scrutiny and to familiarize 
interviewers with their backgrounds. Many firms offer online applications, which help 
to streamline the process and improve data gathering capabilities for the firm. In fact, 
paper applications are becoming increasingly rare.
Many job candidates submit résumés, and some firms require them. A résumé is a 
one- or two-page summary of the candidate’s background and qualifications. It may 
include a description of the type of job the applicant is seeking. A résumé may be sent 
to a firm to request consideration for available jobs, or it may be submitted along with 
an employment application.
To improve the usefulness of information, HRM specialists ask current employees 
about factors in their backgrounds most related to their current jobs. Then these fac-
tors are included on the applications and may be weighted more heavily when evaluat-
ing new applicants’ qualifications.
Employment Tests  Tests administered to job candidates usually focus on aptitudes, 
skills, abilities, or knowledge relevant to the job. Such tests (basic computer skills tests, 
for example) indicate how well the applicant will do the job. Occasionally, companies 
use general intelligence or personality tests, but these are seldom helpful in predicting 
specific job performance. Many organizations, from the very small up to Fortune 500 
companies, use predictive behavior tests. Improved technology has brought down sub-
stantially the costs of administering such tests.

Interviews  The interview is perhaps the most widely used selection technique. Job 
candidates are interviewed by at least one member of the HRM staff and by the per-
son for whom they will be working. Candidates for higher-level jobs may meet with a 
department head or vice president over several interviews.
Interviews provide an opportunity for applicants and the firm to learn more about 
each other. Interviewers can pose problems to test the candidate’s abilities, probe employ-
ment history, and learn something about the candidate’s attitudes and motivation. The 
candidate has a chance to find out more about the job and potential co-workers. In 
some instances, companies are able to use video conferencing software like Skype or 
Oovoo. This has made the interviewing process easier for companies. Some companies 
have been able to reduce the number of applicants being flown in for interviews.13
Unfortunately, interviewing may be the stage at which discrimination begins. For 
example, suppose that a female applicant mentions that she is the mother of small 
children. Her interviewer may assume that she would not be available for job-related 
travel. In addition, interviewers may be unduly influenced by such factors as appear-
ance, or they may ask different questions of different applicants so that it becomes 
impossible to compare candidates’ qualifications. Table 9.2 contains interview ques-
tions that are difficult to answer.
Some of these problems can be solved through better interviewer training and use 
of structured interviews. In a structured interview, the interviewer asks only a prepared

Paper and pencil testing has given way 
to online tests that enable companies to 
assess your skills, attitudes, and personality 
before making a hiring decision—and, in many 
cases, before scheduling an interview. Pre-employment testing 
helps companies screen out people who lack the necessary 
skills and focus on candidates who may have what it takes 
to succeed in a particular position. For example, St. Luke’s 
Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, doesn’t just look for 
top-notch medical skills—it also uses a pre-employment test 
to determine whether job applicants have a positive attitude 
toward customer service.
When Bon-Ton Stores wants to fill a sales position in the 
cosmetics department, it requires applicants to complete an 
online test with 80 questions. The test helps the department 
store identify people who are good problem-solvers, who 
can think logically, and who have strong math skills. Since 
Bon-Ton began using this test, it has significantly reduced 
turnover in the cosmetics department while improving sales 
results.
Brown Shoe, a footwear retailer, began using pre-
employment assessments as part of a broader shift toward 
more personalized customer service. Then, in testing the test 
for store managers, it wound up fine-tuning questions that 
evaluate verbal reasoning, because those skills are particularly 
important for good on-the-job performance.

Part 4   Human Resources
set of job-related questions. The firm also may consider using 
several different interviewers for each applicant, but this is likely 
to be costly.
References  A job candidate generally is asked to furnish the 
names of references—people who can verify background infor-
mation and provide personal evaluations. Naturally, applicants 
tend to list only references who are likely to say good things. 
Thus, personal evaluations obtained from references may not 
be of much value. However, references are often contacted to 
verify such information as previous job responsibilities and the 
reason an applicant left a former job. In some instances, online 
social networking has changed the order in which employers 
receive information. Usually, references come after interviews. 
However, applicants may have former employers and colleagues 
post recommendations to their LinkedIn accounts so that poten-
tial employers see positive reviews about their work even before 
interviewing them.
Assessment Centers  An assessment center is used primarily 
to select current employees for promotion to higher-level posi-
tions. Typically, a group of employees is sent to the center for a 
few days. While there, they participate in activities designed to simulate the manage-
ment environment and to predict managerial effectiveness. Trained observers make 
recommendations regarding promotion possibilities. Although this technique is gaining 
popularity, the expense involved limits its use.
Orientation
Once all information about job candidates has been collected and analyzed, the 
company extends a job offer. If it is accepted, the candidate becomes an employee.
Soon after a candidate joins a firm, he or she goes through the firm’s orientation 
program. Orientation is the process of acquainting new employees with an organiza-
tion. Orientation topics range from the location of the company cafeteria to career 
paths within the firm. The orientation itself may consist of a half-hour informal pre-
sentation by a human resources manager, or it may be an elaborate program involving 
dozens of people and lasting several days or weeks.
Compensation and Benefits
An effective employee reward system must (1) enable employees to satisfy basic needs, 
(2) provide rewards comparable with those offered by other firms, (3) be distributed 
fairly within the organization, and (4) recognize that different people have different 
needs.
A firm’s compensation system can be structured to meet the first three of these 
requirements. The fourth is more difficult because it must account for many variables. 
Most firms offer a number of benefits that, taken together, generally help to provide 
for employees’ varying needs.
Compensation Decisions
Compensation is the payment employees receive in return for their labor. Its importance 
to employees is obvious. Because compensation can account for a significant percentage 
of a firm’s operating costs, it is equally important to the management. For example, 
health care services have the highest ratio of salaries to operating expenses—salaries 
account for 54 percent of operating costs.14 Therefore, the firm’s compensation system, 
the policies and strategies that determine employee compensation, must be designed

carefully to provide for employees’ needs while keeping labor costs within reasonable 
limits. For most firms, designing an effective compensation system requires three 
separate management decisions—wage level, wage structure, and individual wages.
Wage Level  Management first must position the firm’s general pay level relative to 
pay levels of comparable firms. Most firms choose a pay level near the industry aver-
age. However, a firm that is not in good financial shape may pay less than average, and 
large, prosperous organizations may pay more than average.
To determine the average pay for a job, the firm may use wage surveys. A wage 
­survey is a collection of data on prevailing wage rates within an industry or a geo-
graphic area. Such surveys are compiled by industry associations, local governments, 
personnel associations, and (occasionally) individual firms.
Wage Structure  Next, management must decide on relative pay levels for all the 
positions within the firm. Will managers be paid more than secretaries? Will secretar-
ies be paid more than custodians? The result of this set of decisions is often called the 
firm’s wage structure.
The wage structure almost always is developed on the basis of a job evaluation. Job 
evaluation is the process of determining the relative worth of the various jobs within a 
firm. Most observers probably would agree that a secretary should make more money 
than a custodian, but how much more? Job evaluation should provide the answer to 
this question.
A number of techniques may be used to evaluate jobs. The simplest is to rank all 
the jobs within the firm according to value. A more frequently used method is based on 
the job analysis. Points are allocated to each job for each of its elements and require-
ments. For example, “college degree required” might be worth 50 points, whereas the 
need for a high school education might count for only 25 points. The more points a 
job is allocated, the more important it is presumed to be (and the higher its level in the 
firm’s wage structure).
Individual Wages  Finally, the company must determine the specific payments indi-
vidual employees will receive. Consider the case of two secretaries working side by 
side. Job evaluation has been used to determine the relative level of secretarial pay 
within the firm’s wage structure. However, suppose that one secretary has 15 years of 
experience and can type 80 words per minute accurately and the other has two years 
of experience and can type only 55 words per minute; in most firms, these two people 
would not receive the same pay. Instead, a wage range would be established for the sec-
retarial position. In this case, the range might be $8.50 to $12.50 per hour. The more 
experienced and proficient secretary then would be paid an amount near the top of the 
range (say, $12.25 per hour); the less experienced secretary would receive an amount 
that is lower but still within the range (say, $8.75 per hour).
Two wage decisions come into play here. First, the employee’s initial rate must be 
established. It is based on experience, other qualifications, and expected performance. 
Later, the employee may be given pay increases based on seniority and performance.
Comparable Worth
One reason women in the workforce are paid less may be that a proportion of women 
occupy female-dominated jobs—nurses, secretaries, and medical records analysts, for 
example—that require education, skills, and training equal to higher-paid positions 
but are undervalued. Comparable worth is a concept that seeks equal compensation 
for jobs that require about the same level of education, training, and skill. In recent 
decades, many states have taken steps to ensure that all workers have equal pay for 
comparable worth, but the issue remains contentious. Wisconsin, for example, has 
mulled passing a bill that would remove workers’ ability to sue employers for many 
types of discrimination. Legal moves like this prove that the issue of equal pay for equal

work is far from settled. Critics of comparable worth believe that the market should 
determine the worth of jobs and laws should not tamper with the market’s pricing 
mechanisms.15 The Equal Pay Act, discussed later in this chapter, does not address 
the issue of comparable worth. Critics also argue that inflating salaries artificially for 
female-dominated occupations encourages women to keep these jobs rather than seek 
out higher-paying jobs.
Types of Compensation
Compensation can be paid in a variety of forms. Most forms of compensation fall 
into the following categories: hourly wage, weekly or monthly salary, commissions, 
incentive payments, lump-sum salary increases, and profit sharing.
Hourly Wage  An hourly wage is a specific amount of money paid for each hour 
of work. People who earn wages are paid their hourly wage for the first 40 hours 
worked in any week. They are then paid one-and-one-half times their hourly wage for 
time worked in excess of 40 hours (i.e., they are paid “time-and-a-half” for overtime). 
Workers in retail and fast-food chains, on assembly lines, and in clerical positions usu-
ally are paid an hourly wage.
Weekly or Monthly Salary  A salary is a specific amount of money paid for an 
employee’s work during a set calendar period, regardless of the actual number of hours 
worked. Salaried employees receive no overtime pay, but they do not lose pay when 
they are absent from work. Most professional and managerial positions are salaried.
Commissions  A commission is a payment that is a percentage of sales revenue. 
Sales representatives and sales managers often are paid entirely through commissions 
or through a combination of commissions and salary.
Incentive Payments  An incentive payment is a payment in addition to wages, sal-
ary, or commissions. Incentive payments are really extra rewards for outstanding job 
performance. They may be distributed to all employees or only to certain employees. 
Some firms distribute incentive payments to all employees annually. The size of the 
payment depends on the firm’s earnings and, at times, on the particular employee’s 
length of service with the firm. Firms sometimes offer incentives to employees who 
exceed specific sales or production goals, a practice called gain sharing.
To avoid yearly across-the-board salary increases, some organizations reward out-
standing workers individually through merit pay. This pay-for-performance approach 
allows management to control labor costs while encouraging employees to work more 
efficiently. An employee’s merit pay depends on his or her achievements relative to 
those of others.
Lump-Sum Salary Increases  In traditional reward systems, an employee who 
receives an annual pay increase is given part of the increase in each pay period. For 
example, suppose that an employee on a monthly salary gets a 10 percent annual pay 
hike. He or she actually receives 10 percent of the former monthly salary added to 
each month’s paycheck for a year. Companies that offer a lump-sum salary increase 
give the employee the option of taking the entire pay raise in one lump sum. The 
employee then draws his or her “regular” pay for the rest of the year. The lump-
sum payment typically is treated as an interest-free loan that must be repaid if the 
employee leaves the firm during the year.
Profit-Sharing  Profit-sharing is the distribution of a percentage of a firm’s profit 
among its employees. The idea is to motivate employees to work effectively by giving 
them a stake in the company’s financial success. General Motors employees participate 
in employee profit-sharing plans. Workers have benefited from this perk recently, as the

company recovered after the auto bailouts. Recently, it 
reported profits of over $400 million and was able to 
cut profit-sharing checks of up to $7,000 to its hourly 
wage earners.16
Employee Benefits
An employee benefit is a reward in addition to regular 
compensation that is provided indirectly to employees. 
Employee benefits consist mainly of services (such as 
insurance) that are paid for partially or totally by employers and 
employee expenses (such as college tuition) that are reimbursed 
by employers. Currently, the average cost of these benefits is 
nearly 30 percent of an employee’s total compensation, which 
includes wages plus benefits.17 Thus, a person who received 
total compensation (including benefits) of $50,000 a year 
earned $35,300 in wages and received an additional $14,700 
in benefits.
Types of Benefits  Employee benefits take a variety of 
forms. Pay for time not worked covers such absences as vaca-
tion time, holidays, and sick leave. Insurance packages may 
include health, life, and dental insurance for employees and 
their families. Some firms pay the entire cost of the insurance 
package, and others share the cost with the employee. The costs 
of pension and retirement programs also may be borne entirely 
by the firm or shared with the employee.
Some benefits are required by law. For example, employers must maintain work-
ers’ compensation insurance, which pays medical bills for injuries that occur on the job 
and provides income for employees who are disabled by job-related injuries. Employers 
must also pay for unemployment insurance and contribute to each employee’s federal 
Social Security account.
Other benefits provided by employers include tuition-reimbursement plans, credit 
unions, child-care services, company cafeterias, exercise rooms, and 
broad stock-option plans available to all employees. Some compa-
nies offer special benefits to U.S. military reservists who are called 
up for active duty.
Some companies offer unusual benefits to attract and retain

Flexible Benefit Plans  Through a flexible benefit plan, an 
employee receives a predetermined amount of benefit dollars and 
may allocate those dollars to various categories of benefits in the 
mix that best fits his or her needs. Some flexible benefit plans offer 
a broad array of benefit options, including health care, dental care, 
life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment coverage for 
both the worker and dependents, long-term disability coverage, 
vacation benefits, retirement savings, and dependent-care benefits.

When you’re applying for a new job, wait to ask about 
benefits until you’ve been offered the position. During 
your first interview, stay focused on the company and how 
you can be an asset in this position, not on the benefits or 
compensation.

What job benefits are crucial to you? The benefits 
companies provide vary widely. Large companies are 
often able to offer employees more benefits than small 
ones. However, in small firms, employees are more 
likely to do a broader range of tasks and advance to 
higher positions more quickly.

Other firms offer limited options, primarily in health and life insurance and retirement 
plans.
Although the cost of administering flexible plans is high, a number of organiza-
tions, including Quaker Oats and Coca-Cola, have implemented this option for several 
reasons. Because employees’ needs are so diverse, flexible plans help firms to offer ben-
efit packages that more specifically meet their employees’ needs. Flexible plans can, in 
the long run, help a company to contain costs because a specified amount is allocated 
to cover the benefits of each employee. Furthermore, organizations that offer flexible 
plans with many choices may be perceived as being employee-friendly. Thus, they are 
in a better position to attract and retain qualified employees.
Training and Development
Training and development are extremely important at the Container Store. Because 
great customer service is so important, every first-year full-time salesperson receives 
about 185 hours of formal training as opposed to the industry standard, which is 
approximately seven hours. Training and development continue throughout a person’s 
career. Each store has a full-time trainer called the super sales trainer. This trainer 
provides product training, sales training, and employee-development training. A 
number of top managers believe that the financial and human resources invested in 
training and development are well worth it.
Both training and development are aimed at improving employees’ skills and 
abilities. However, the two are usually differentiated as either employee training or 
management development. Employee training is the process of teaching operations 
and technical employees how to do their present jobs more effectively and efficiently. 
Management development is the process of preparing managers and other profes-
sionals to assume increased responsibility in both present and future positions. Thus, 
training and development differ in who is being taught and the purpose of the teaching. 
However, both are necessary for personal and organizational growth. Companies that 
hope to stay competitive typically make huge commitments to employee training and 
development. Internet-based e-learning is growing. Driven by cost, travel, and time sav-
ings, online learning alone (and in conjunction with face-to-face situations) is a strong 
alternative strategy. Development of a training program usually has three components: 
analysis of needs, determination of training and development methods, and creation of 
an evaluation system to assess the program’s effectiveness.
Some employers are using new approaches to train and certify workers. They have 
found that having a good education may not provide an employee 
with necessary skills to do a job well, so some organizations have 
developed a system that works similarly to the Boy Scouts merit 
badge. A potential employee completes a certification course geared 
toward a certain line of work and receives a “badge” upon suc-
cessful completion. Programs like this cut down on the additional 
on-the-job training required after being hired because they are 
geared toward training in a specific field. Having such certification 
provides an employer with a better idea of the exact skill set of 
a potential employee. Once hired, employees undergo additional 
training, which varies a great deal from firm to firm and between 
industries.19
Analysis of Training Needs
When thinking about developing a training program, managers 
first must determine if training is needed and, if so, what types of 
training needs exist. At times, what at first appears to be a need for 
training is actually, on assessment, a need for motivation. Training 
needs can vary considerably. For example, some employees may 
need training to improve their technical skills, or they may need

training about organizational procedures. Training also 
may focus on business ethics, product information, or 
customer service. Because training is expensive, it is 
critical that the correct training needs be identified.
Training and Development Methods
A number of methods are available for employee training 
and management development. Some of these methods 
may be more suitable for one or the other, but most can be 
applied to both training and management development.
●
●On-the-job methods. The trainee learns by doing the work 
under the supervision of an experienced employee.
●
●Simulations. The work situation is simulated in a separate 
area so that learning takes place away from the day-to-day 
pressures of work.
●
●Classroom teaching and lectures. You probably already 
know these methods quite well.
●
●Conferences and seminars. Experts and learners meet to 
discuss problems and exchange ideas.
●
●Role-playing. Participants act out the roles of others in the 
organization for better understanding of those roles (pri-
marily a management development tool).
Evaluation of Training and Development
Training and development are very expensive. The training itself 
costs quite a bit, and employees are usually not working—or are 
working at a reduced load and pace—during training sessions. 
To ensure that training and development are cost-effective, the 
managers responsible should evaluate the company’s efforts 
periodically.
The starting point for this evaluation is a set of veri-
fiable objectives that are developed before the training is 
undertaken. Suppose that a training program is expected to 
improve the skills of machinists. The objective of the pro-
gram might be stated as follows: “At the end of the training 
period, each machinist should be able to process 30 parts per 
hour with no more than one defective part per 90 parts com-
pleted.” This objective clearly specifies what is expected and 
how training results may be measured or verified. Evaluation 
then consists of measuring machinists’ output and the ratio 
of defective parts produced after the training.
The results of training evaluations should be made known 
to all those involved in the program—including trainees and 
upper management. For trainees, the results of evaluations can 
enhance motivation and learning. For upper management, the 
results may be the basis for making decisions about the training 
program itself.
Performance Appraisal
Performance appraisal is the evaluation of employees’ current and potential levels 
of performance to allow managers to make objective human resources decisions. The 
process has three main objectives. First, managers use performance appraisals to let

Part 4   Human Resources
workers know how well they are doing and how they can do better in the future. 
Second, a performance appraisal provides an effective basis for distributing rewards, 
such as pay raises and promotions. Third, performance appraisal helps the organization 
monitor its employee selection, training, and development activities. If large numbers 
of employees continually perform below expectations, the firm may need to revise its 
selection process or strengthen its training and development activities. Most performance 
appraisal processes include a written document. An example appears in Figure 9.3.
Common Evaluation Techniques
The various techniques and methods for appraising employee performance are either 
objective or judgmental in nature.
Objective Methods  Objective appraisal methods use some measurable quantity as 
the basis for assessing performance. Units of output, dollar volume of sales, number of 
defective products, and number of insurance claims processed are all objective, measur-
able quantities. Thus, an employee who processes an average of 26 insurance claims 
per week is given a higher evaluation than one whose average is 19 claims per week.
Such objective measures may require some adjustment for the work environment. 
Suppose that the first of our insurance claims processors works in New York City and the 
second works in rural Iowa. Both must visit each client because they are processing hom-
eowners’ insurance claims. The difference in their average weekly output may be entirely 
because of the long distances the Iowan must travel to visit clients. In this case, the two 
workers may very well be equally competent and motivated. Thus, a manager must take 
into account circumstances that may be hidden by a purely statistical measurement.

263
Judgmental Methods  Judgmental appraisal methods are used much more fre-
quently than objective methods. They require that the manager judge or estimate the 
employee’s performance level. However, judgmental methods are not capricious. These 
methods are based on employee ranking or rating scales. When ranking is used, the 
manager ranks subordinates from best to worst. This approach has a number of draw-
backs, including the lack of any absolute standard. Use of rating scales is the most pop-
ular judgmental appraisal technique. A rating scale consists of a number of statements; 
each employee is rated on the degree to which the statement applies. For example, one 
statement might be, “This employee always does high-quality work.” The supervisor 
would give the employee a rating, from 5 down to 1, corresponding to gradations rang-
ing from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree.” The ratings on all the statements are 
added to obtain the employee’s total evaluation.
Avoiding Appraisal Errors  Managers must be cautious if they are to avoid mak-
ing mistakes when appraising employees. It is common to overuse one portion of an 
evaluation instrument, thus overemphasizing some issues and underemphasizing oth-
ers. A manager must guard against allowing an employee’s poor performance on one 
activity to influence his or her judgment of that subordinate’s work on other activities. 
Similarly, putting too much weight on recent performance distorts an employee’s evalu-
ation. For example, if the employee is being rated on performance over the last year, a 
manager should not permit last month’s disappointing performance to overshadow the 
quality of the work done in the first 11 months of the year. Finally, a manager must 
guard against discrimination on the basis of race, age, gender, religion, national origin, 
or sexual orientation.
Performance Feedback
No matter which appraisal technique is used, the results should be discussed with 
the employee soon after the evaluation is completed. The manager should explain the 
basis for present rewards and should let the employee know what he or she can do 
to be recognized as a better performer in the future. The information provided to an 
employee in such discussions is called performance feedback, and the process is known 
as a performance feedback interview.
There are three major approaches to performance feedback 
interviews: tell-and-sell, tell-and-listen, and problem solving. In 
a tell-and-sell feedback interview, the superior tells the employee 
how good or bad the employee’s performance has been and then 
attempts to persuade the employee to accept the evaluation. Because 
the employee has no input into the evaluation, the tell-and-sell inter-
view can lead to defensiveness, resentment, and frustration on the 
part of the subordinate. The employee may not accept the results of 
the interview and may not be committed to achieving the goals that 
are set.
With the tell-and-listen approach, the supervisor tells the 
employee what has been right and wrong with the employee’s per-
formance and then gives the employee a chance to respond. The 
subordinate may simply be given an opportunity to react to the 
supervisor’s statements or may be permitted to offer a full self-
appraisal, challenging the supervisor’s assessment.
In the problem-solving approach, employees evaluate their own 
performance and set their own goals for future performance. The 
supervisor is more a colleague than a judge and offers comments and 
advice in a noncritical manner. An active and open dialogue ensues in 
which goals for improvement are mutually established. The problem-
solving interview is most likely to result in the employee’s commit-
ment to the established goals.

Performance feedback can help employees 
progress within an organization. A business 
usually evaluatesits employees on an annual basis, 
but sometimes it does so quarterly and even monthly, 
especially when they are newly hired. Performance 
reviews that gather feedback about an employee 
from his or her peers, subordinates, and supervisors 
can help the person get a realistic view of his or her 
strengths and weaknesses.

Part 4   Human Resources
To avoid some of the problems associated with the tell-and-sell interview, super-
visors sometimes use a mixed approach. The mixed interview uses the tell-and-sell 
approach to communicate administrative decisions and the problem-solving approach 
to discuss employee-development issues and future performance goals.
An appraisal approach that has become popular is called a 360-degree evaluation. 
A 360-degree evaluation collects anonymous reviews about an employee from his or her 
peers, subordinates, and supervisors and then compiles these reviews into a feedback report 
that is given to the employee. Companies that invest significant resources in employee-
development efforts are especially likely to use 360-degree evaluations. An employee 
should not be given a feedback report without first having a one-on-one meeting with his 
or her supervisor. The most appropriate way to introduce a 360-degree evaluation system 
in a company is to begin with upper-level management. Then managers should be trained 
on how to interpret feedback reports so that they can coach their employees on how to 
use the feedback to achieve higher-level job-related skills and behaviors.
Finally, we should note that many managers find it difficult to discuss the nega-
tive aspects of an appraisal. Unfortunately, they may ignore performance feedback 
altogether or provide it in a very weak and ineffectual manner. In truth, though, most 
employees have strengths that can be emphasized to soften the discussion of their 
weaknesses. An employee may not even be aware of the weaknesses and their conse-
quences. If such weaknesses are not pointed out through performance feedback, they 
cannot possibly be eliminated. Only through tactful, honest communication can the 
results of an appraisal be fully used.
The Legal Environment of HRM
Legislation regarding HRM practices has been passed mainly to protect the rights of 
employees, to promote job safety, and to eliminate discrimination in the workplace. 
The major federal laws affecting HRM are described in Table 9.3.
National Labor Relations Act and Labor–
Management Relations Act
These laws are concerned with dealings between business firms and labor unions. 
This general area is, in concept, a part of HRM. However, because of its importance, 
it is often treated as a separate set of activities. We discuss both labor–management 
relations and these two acts in detail in Chapter 11.
Fair Labor Standards Act
This act, passed in 1938 and amended many times since, applies primarily to wages. 
It established minimum wages and overtime pay rates. Many managers and other 
professionals, however, are exempt from this law. Managers, for example, seldom get 
paid overtime when they work more than 40 hours a week.
Equal Pay Act
Passed in 1963, this law overlaps somewhat with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (see 
next section). The Equal Pay Act specifies that men and women who are doing equal 
jobs must be paid the same wage. Equal jobs are jobs that demand equal effort, skill, and 
responsibility and are performed under the same conditions. Differences in pay are legal if 
they can be attributed to differences in seniority, qualifications, or performance. However, 
women cannot be paid less (or more) for the same work solely because they are women. 
In spite of having this law on the books for 50 years, women and men are not treated 
equally in the workplace. For example, only 3 percent of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies 
are women, and women still only earn 77 cents for every dollar earned by men. In order 
to better gauge and track this issue, the Department of Labor called on technology gurus 
to help. It created the Equal Pay App Challenge, which asks the general public to help 
develop an app that will educate people about persistent pay inequality issues.20

Civil Rights Acts
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applies directly to selection and promotion. 
It forbids organizations with 15 or more employees to discriminate in those areas on 
the basis of sex, race, color, religion, or national origin. The purpose of Title VII is to 
ensure that employers make personnel decisions on the basis of employee qualifications 
only. As a result of this act, discrimination in employment (especially against African 
Americans) has been reduced in this country.
The EEOC is charged with enforcing Title VII. A person who believes that he or 
she has been discriminated against can file a complaint with the EEOC. The commis-
sion then investigates the complaint and, if it finds that the person has, in fact, been 
the victim of discrimination, the commission can take legal action on his or her behalf.
The Civil Rights Act of 1991 facilitates an employee’s suing and collecting punitive 
damages for sexual discrimination. Discriminatory promotion and termination deci-
sions as well as on-the-job issues, such as sexual harassment, are covered by this act.
Age Discrimination in Employment Act
The general purpose of this act, which was passed in 1967 and amended in 1986, is the 
same as that of Title VII—to eliminate discrimination. However, as the name implies, 
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act is concerned only with discrimination 
based on age. It applies to companies with 20 or more employees. In particular, it

Part 4   Human Resources
outlaws personnel practices that discriminate against people aged 40 years or older. 
(No federal law forbids discrimination against people younger than 40 years, but 
several states have adopted age discrimination laws that apply to a variety of age 
groups.) Also outlawed are company policies that specify a mandatory retirement age. 
Employers must base employment decisions on ability and not on a number.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
Passed in 1970, this act is mainly concerned with issues of employee health and safety. For 
example, the act regulates the degree to which employees can be exposed to hazardous 
substances. It also specifies the safety equipment that the employer must provide.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) was created to 
enforce this act. Inspectors from OSHA investigate employee complaints regarding 
unsafe working conditions. They also make spot checks on companies operating in 
particularly hazardous industries, such as chemical and mining industries, to ensure 
compliance with the law. A firm found to be in violation of federal standards can be 
heavily fined or shut down. Nonetheless, many people feel that issuing OSHA viola-
tions is not enough to protect workers from harm.
Employee Retirement Income Security Act
This act was passed in 1974 to protect the retirement benefits of employees. It does not 
require that firms provide a retirement plan. However, it does specify that if a retirement 
plan is provided, it must be managed in such a way that the interests of employees are 
protected. It also provides federal insurance for retirement plans that go bankrupt.
Affirmative Action
Affirmative action is not one act but a series of executive orders issued by the President 
of the United States. These orders established the requirement for affirmative action 
in personnel practices. This stipulation applies to all employers with 50 or more 
employees holding federal contracts in excess of $50,000. It prescribes that such 
employers (1) actively encourage job applications from members 
of minority groups and (2) hire qualified employees from minority 
groups who are not fully represented in their organizations. Many 
firms that do not hold government contracts voluntarily take part 
in this affirmative action program.
Americans with Disabilities Act
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination 
against qualified individuals with disabilities in all employment 
practices—including job-application procedures, hiring, firing, 
advancement, compensation, training, and other terms and 
conditions of employment. All private employers and government 
agencies with 15 or more employees are covered by the ADA. 
Defining who is a qualified individual with a disability is, of course, 
difficult. Depending on how qualified individual with a disability is 
interpreted, more than 50 million Americans can be included under 
this law.21 This law also mandates that all businesses that serve the 
public must make their facilities accessible to people with disabilities.
The ADA not only protects individuals with obvious physical 
disabilities but also safeguards those with less visible conditions, such 
as heart disease, diabetes, epilepsy, cancer, AIDS, and mental illnesses. 
Because of this law, many organizations no longer require job appli-
cants to pass physical examinations as a condition of employment.
Employers are required to provide disabled employees with rea-
sonable accommodation. Reasonable accommodation is any modi-
fication or adjustment to a job or work environment that will enable

Focus on what employees and job candidates can 
do—not  what they can’t. The American Disabilities 
Act (ADA) requires  businesses to make reasonable 
accommodations for applicants and employees with 
disabilities. The law isn’t the only reason  why firms 
should hire and retain the disabled, though. Studies  
have shown that firms that do so experience positive 
business outcomes. Many manual and electronic 
devices are available today that can help the disabled 
work safely and productively. Simply redesigning a 
workstation slightly can make it possible for someone 
to work at a job he or she couldn’t before.

a qualified employee with a disability to perform a central job function. Examples of 
reasonable accommodation include making existing facilities readily accessible to and 
usable by an individual confined to a wheelchair. Reasonable accommodation also 
might mean restructuring a job, modifying work schedules, acquiring or modifying 
equipment, providing qualified readers or interpreters, or changing training programs.
Describe the major components of human 
resources management.
Human resources management (HRM) is the set of activities 
involved in acquiring, maintaining, and developing an 
organization’s human resources. Responsibility for HRM is 
shared by specialized staff and line managers. HRM activities 
include human resources planning, job analysis, recruitment, 
selection, orientation, compensation, benefits, training and 
development, and performance appraisal.
Identify the steps in human resources planning.
Human resources planning consists of forecasting the human 
resources that a firm will need and those that it will have 
available and then planning a course of action to match 
supply with demand. Layoffs, attrition, early retirement, and 
(as a last resort) firing are ways to reduce the size of the 
workforce. Supply is increased through hiring.
Describe cultural diversity and understand some 
of the challenges and opportunities associated 
with it.
Cultural diversity refers to the differences among people in 
a workforce owing to race, ethnicity, and gender. With an 
increasing number of women, minorities, and immigrants 
entering the U.S. workforce, management is faced with both 
challenges and competitive advantages. Some organizations 
are implementing diversity-related training programs and 
working to make the most of cultural diversity. With proper 
guidance and management, a culturally diverse organization 
can prove beneficial to all involved.
Explain the objectives and uses of job analysis.
Job analysis provides a job description and a job specification 
for each position within a firm. A job description is a list of 
the elements that make up a particular job. A job specification 
is a list of qualifications required to perform a particular job. 
Job analysis is used in evaluation and in the determination of 
compensation levels and serves as the basis for recruiting and 
selecting new employees.

When LinkedIn launched in 2003, its founders could never 
have imagined that less than a decade later, it would 
attract 120 new members per minute, around the clock 
and around the world. This social media site for profes-
sionals has grown into an important networking tool for 
connecting companies and job candidates at all levels. In 
the words of one LinkedIn executive, the site is a “global 
talent marketplace” where individual members are “entre-
preneurs of their own lives.”
To get noticed by potential employers on LinkedIn, 
members need to post and keep their professional pro-
files updated. The more people in their network of con-
tacts, the more possibilities for connecting with someone 
at a company that’s hiring. Joining industry or specialized 
groups helps members stay on top of new developments 
and new openings in their chosen fields. Finally, LinkedIn 
is a good place to research possible employers and make 
one-to-one connections with a company recruiter.
Questions
1.	 What are the advantages and disadvantages of asking 
employees to alert their LinkedIn member networks 
when a job opening is available?
2.	 Do you think a company should be able to view the 
LinkedIn profiles of members who work for its com-
petitors and even contact them about job openings? 
Explain your answer.

Part 4   Human Resources
Describe the processes of recruiting, employee 
selection, and orientation.
Recruiting is the process of attracting qualified job applicants. 
Candidates for open positions may be recruited from within 
or outside a firm. In the selection process, information about 
candidates is obtained from applications, résumés, tests, 
interviews, references, or assessment centers. This information 
then is used to select the most appropriate candidate for the 
job. Newly hired employees will then go through a formal 
or an informal orientation program to acquaint themselves 
with the firm.
Discuss the primary elements of employee 
compensation and benefits.
Compensation is the payment employees receive in return 
for their labor. In developing a system for paying employees, 
management must decide on the firm’s general wage level 
(relative to other firms), the wage structure within the firm, 
and individual wages. Wage surveys and job analyses are 
useful in making these decisions. Employees may be paid 
hourly wages, salaries, or commissions. They also may 
receive incentive payments, lump-sum salary increases, 
and profit-sharing payments. Employee benefits, which are 
nonmonetary rewards to employees, add about 28 percent to 
the cost of compensation.
Explain the purposes and techniques of employee 
training and development.
Employee-training and management-development programs 
enhance the ability of employees to contribute to a firm. When 
developing a training program, the company should analyze 
training needs and then select training methods. Because 
training is expensive, an organization should periodically 
evaluate the effectiveness of its training programs.
Discuss performance appraisal techniques and 
performance feedback.
Performance appraisal, or evaluation, is used to provide 
employees with performance feedback, to serve as a basis for 
distributing rewards, and to monitor selection and training 
activities. Both objective and judgmental appraisal techniques 
are used. Their results are communicated to employees 
through three performance feedback approaches: tell-and-
sell, tell-and-listen, and problem solving.
Outline the major legislation affecting human 
resources management.
A number of laws have been passed that affect HRM practices 
and that protect the rights and safety of employees. Some 
of these are the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, the 
Labor–Management Relations Act of 1947, the Fair Labor 
Standards Act of 1938, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title VII 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in 
Employment Acts of 1967 and 1986, the Occupational Safety 
and Health Act of 1970, the Employment Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining 
Notification Act of 1988, the Americans with Disabilities Act 
of 1990, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, and the Family and 
Medical Leave Act of 1993.

Discussion Questions
In today’s global marketplace, managers interact with people 
of different cultures, languages, beliefs, and values. Whirlpool 
Corporation has shown that a diverse workforce can be a power-
ful advantage.
Since its establishment in 1911, Whirlpool, headquartered in 
Michigan, has grown into a global corporation with manufactur-
ing locations on every major continent and annual revenues in 
excess of $19 billion. Approximately 60 percent of Whirlpool’s 
70,000 employees work outside North America. The development 
of this broad workforce is aided by the company’s award-winning 
diversity program, which gathers workers into support groups 
based on personal affiliations. To enter the program, workers 
join a particular employee network of their choosing, such as the 
Hispanic network, the young professionals network, the Asian 
or African American networks, the women’s network, the Native 
American network, or the Pride network, which includes gay, 
lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) employees.
These networks give employees access to a world of new career 
resources and training opportunities. For instance, according to 
the company’s Web site, “Our primary objective is to become the 
employer of choice for GLBT and affirming employees.” Despite 
the program’s obvious focus on employee well-being, leaders at 
Whirlpool say the networks also offer a competitive advantage in 
global marketing. “Having diverse people making decisions and 
giving input to the factors that we consider on a daily basis is 
extremely important to the business,” according to the company’s 
vice president of consumer and appliance care, Kathy Nelson. 
“It’s important because we need to make sure that the people 
who are making business decisions are reflective of who our con-
sumers are.”
This belief is fully in keeping with the company’s Diversity 
Mission Statement, expressed by Chairman and CEO Jeff Fettig: 
“We best serve the unique needs of our customers through 
diverse, inclusive, and engaged employees who truly reflect our 
global customer base.”22
Questions
1.	 What are the three main objectives of Whirlpool’s diversity 
networks?
2.	 What challenges do managers face in establishing a diverse 
workplace, and how might they respond to these challenges?
3.	 Do you think formation of Whirlpool’s employee networks 
is the best way to promote a positive culture of diversity? 
Explain.

When the California-based company Intel was founded in 1968, 
computers were room-sized machines, and most people thought 
that chips were made of chocolate. Today, Intel rings up $54 bil-
lion in annual sales from the production of chips that put com-
puting power into all kinds of digital products for home, office, 
and factory use. The company also creates cloud computing sys-
tems for banks, businesses, and educational institutions.
To stay ahead of demand for its chips and services, Intel adds 
1,000 new positions annually to its worldwide workforce, cur-
rently at 43,000 employees. It uses a variety of high-tech and in-
person recruiting methods to recruit candidates who have what 
it takes to succeed in Intel’s fast-paced work environment. On 
campus, recruiters carry iPads with special software so that they 
can input key details for each student they meet, including name,

Part 4   Human Resources
grades, and courses taken, along with notes about specific job 
interests. This replaces the blizzard of paper résumés that Intel 
used to receive during the campus recruiting season. Because 
students’ profiles appear in Intel’s companywide system almost 
immediately, human resources personnel can match candidates 
with appropriate job opportunities and get in touch the day after 
a campus meeting, compared with a delay of a week or more 
under the old paper-based process.
Intel also invites students, recent graduates, and experienced 
workers to search its job database online or using a smartphone 
app. Visitors to its LinkedIn career pages can network infor-
mally with recruiters in the “student lounge,” click to learn more 
about current job openings, and read testimonials from current 
employees. Intel’s Facebook recruiting pages list job opportuni-
ties by country. The firm also spreads the word about job open-
ings via Twitter messages, blog posts, and periodic recruiting 
podcasts. These social-media recruiting efforts add a personal 
touch and cast a wide net to reach a diverse pool of potential 
candidates.
Intel has been testing virtual career fairs to extend its student 
contact. Instead of traveling to a campus and sitting at a recruit-
ing table for an hour or two, Intel managers stay in the office and 
exchange online messages with students who “attend” remotely 
from their computers. During a two-hour virtual career fair, Intel 
recruiters may exchange messages with 400 students and receive 
more than 600 résumés. Also, Intel hosts webinars about how to 
write a résumé, what to expect on an interview, and other career-
development topics, ending with a question-and-answer session 
for one-to-one communication.
Because of Intel’s global operations and the constant drive 
for innovation, the work is both challenging and exciting. “Many 
days start at 6 a.m. and don’t end until 10 p.m. to accommodate 
the different time zones,” says one human resources manager. 
To reward employees for their hard work, Intel offers a compre-
hensive benefits package. In addition, employees who have been 
with Intel for at least seven years are eligible to take an eight-week 
paid sabbatical. This allows employees to pursue personal inter-
ests and then return to the company with renewed enthusiasm. 
Colleagues are cross-trained to handle an employee’s duties dur-
ing sabbatical periods, creating new opportunities to hone team-
work and personal skills.
Intel regularly appears on Fortune magazine’s “100 Best 
Companies to Work For” list, and it has also been recognized as 
an outstanding employer by Working Mother and other publica-
tions. Not surprisingly, employee turnover is very low, and the 
company receives 100 applications for every open position. No 
matter how technology changes, Intel will need to attract and 
retain talented employees to keep its competitive edge.23
Questions
1.	 How do job candidates and Intel managers benefit when the 
company accepts résumés electronically instead of using printed 
résumés?
2.	 Why would Intel mention its policy on sabbaticals to job candi-
dates and publicize it periodically to current employees?
3.	 What are the advantages and disadvantages of relying on 
virtual career fairs for initial contact with students instead of 
personal meetings on campus?
1 	SOCIAL MEDIA EXERCISE
LinkedIn is the largest and best-known social network for profes-
sionals. Check out www.linkedin.com.

about her friends than about coaching her subordinates. Her 
workers never complain and appear to be satisfied with their 
jobs.
•	 Paul Steiberg is not a good performer, and his work group 
does not feel that he is an effective leader. You also know that 
his group is the toughest one to manage. The work is hard 
and dirty. You realize that it would be very difficult to replace 
him, and you therefore do not want to lose him.
•	 Anna Chen runs a tight ship. Her subordinates like her and 
feel that she is an excellent leader. She listens to them and 
supports them. Recently, her group won the TOP (The 
Outstanding Performance) Award. Anna’s husband is CEO of 
a consulting firm, and as far as you know, she is not in finan-
cial need.
•	 Jill Foster has completed every assignment successfully. You 
are impressed by this, particularly because she has a very 
difficult job. You recently learned that she spends several 
hours every week on her own taking classes to improve her 
skills. Jill seems to be motivated more by recognition than by 
money.
•	 Fred Hammer is a jolly person who gets along with everyone. 
His subordinates like him, but you do not think that he is get-
ting the job done to your expectations. He has missed a criti-
cal delivery date twice, and this cost the firm over $5,000 each 
time. He recently divorced his wife and is having an extremely 
difficult time meeting his financial obligations.
Assignment
1.	 You have $25,000 available for raises. As you think about how 
you will allot the money, consider the following:
a.	 What criteria will you use in making a fair distribution?
b.	 Will you distribute the entire $25,000? If not, what will 
you do with the remainder?
2.	 Prepare a four-column table in the following manner:
a.	 In column 1, write the name of the employee.
b.	 In column 2, write the amount of the raise.
c.	 In column 3, write the percentage of the $25,000 the 
employee will receive.
d.	 In column 4, list the reasons for your decision.
4 	BUILDING TEAM SKILLS
The New Therapy Company is soliciting a contract to provide five 
nursing homes with physical, occupational, speech, and respira-
tory therapy. The therapists will float among the five nursing 
homes. The therapists have not yet been hired, but the nursing 
homes expect them to be fully trained and ready to go to work 
in three months. The previous therapy company lost its contract 
because of high staff turnover owing to “burnout” (a common 
problem in this type of work), high costs, and low-quality care. 
The nursing homes want a plan specifying how the New Therapy 
Company will meet staffing needs, keep costs low, and provide 
high-quality care.
Assignment
1.	 Working in a group, discuss how the New Therapy Company 
can meet the three-month deadline and still ensure that the 
care its therapists provide is of high quality. Also discuss the 
following:
a.	 How many of each type of therapist will the company 
need?
b.	 How will it prevent therapists from “burning out”?
c.	 How can it retain experienced staff and still limit costs?
d.	 Are promotions available for any of the staff? What is the 
career ladder?
e.	 How will the company manage therapists at five different 
locations? How will it keep in touch with them (computer, 
voice mail, or monthly meetings)? Would it make more 
sense to have therapists work permanently at each loca-
tion rather than rotate among them?
f.	 How will the company justify the travel costs? What other 
expenses might it expect?
2.	 Prepare a plan for the New Therapy Company to present to 
the nursing homes.
5 	RESEARCHING DIFFERENT CAREERS
A résumé provides a summary of your skills, abilities, and achieve-
ments. It also may include a description of the type of job you 
want. A well-prepared résumé indicates that you know what your 
career objectives are, shows that you have given serious thought 
to your career, and tells a potential employer what you are quali-
fied to do. The way a résumé is prepared can make a difference in 
whether you are considered for a job.
Assignment
1.	 Prepare a résumé for a job that you want using the informa-
tion in Appendix A (see text Web site).
a.	 First, determine what your skills are and decide which 
skills are needed to do this particular job.
b.	 Decide which type of format—chronological or func-
tional—would be most effective in presenting your skills 
and experience.
c.	 Keep the résumé to one page, if possible (definitely no 
more than two pages). (Note that portfolio items may be 
attached for certain types of jobs, such as artwork.)
2.	 Have several people review the résumé for accuracy.
3.	 Ask your instructor to comment on your résumé.

REI Remains True to Its Roots
Since 1998, when the annual ranking began, REI has appeared on every one of Fortune 
magazine’s lists of “100 Best Companies to Work For.” REI—short for Recreational 
Equipment Inc.—sells outdoor equipment and clothing through two e-commerce sites 
and 122 stores in 29 states. Founded in the 1930s by a group of mountain climbers, REI 
has remained true to its roots by promoting responsible enjoyment of the outdoors, from 
the peak of Mount Everest to the dunes of Manhattan Beach. This is only one reason why 
REI’s 10,400 employees—whether they’re climbers, kayakers, skiers, or campers—are so 
enthusiastic about their jobs.
Working for REI brings outdoor-minded employees into daily contact with dozens of 
like-minded colleagues and customers, as well as everyday opportunities to test and sell the 
best equipment for their sports. The company also offers employees generous discounts 
on merchandise and adventure travel, and encourages them to volunteer for conservation 
programs and other community activities. Before opening a new store, REI hires local 
guides to give employees a taste of nearby outdoor activities. For example, employees of 
the New York City megastore hiked parks and waterfront inlets in northern Manhattan, far 
greener areas than the busy downtown district where the store is located—forging closer 
team ties in the process.
All REI staff members are eligible for health-care benefits, whether they work full- or 
part-time, a rarity in the retail industry but in keeping with the firm’s tradition of caring for 
its employees. “We truly believe that our employees are our greatest asset,” explains REI’s 
senior vice president of human resources. “Whether they work five hours a week or they 
work 40 hours a week, they create the customer experience and they create the success for 
the organization.”
Another way REI boosts satisfaction is by helping employees balance their personal 
and professional lives, through options such as telecommuting and flexible work sched-
ules. And the longer employees remain with REI, the longer their vacation period. Finally, 
employees can apply for a company grant to realize their dreams of tackling personal out-
door challenges such as climbing in the Himalayas.1

T
o achieve its goals, any organization—whether it is REI, Google, or a local con-
venience store—must be sure that its employees have more than the right raw 
materials, adequate facilities, and equipment that works. The organization also 
must ensure that its employees are motivated. To some extent, a high level of employee 
motivation derives from effective management practices.
In this chapter, after first explaining what motivation is, we present several views 
of motivation that have influenced management practices over the years: Taylor’s ideas 
of scientific management, Mayo’s Hawthorne Studies, Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, 
Herzberg’s motivation–hygiene theory, McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y, Ouchi’s 
Theory Z, and reinforcement theory. Then, turning our attention to contemporary 
ideas, we examine equity theory, expectancy theory, and goal-setting theory. Finally, 
we discuss specific techniques managers can use to foster employee motivation and 
satisfaction.

What Is Motivation?
A motive is something that causes a person to act. A successful athlete is said to be 
“highly motivated.” A student who avoids work is said to be “unmotivated.” We define 
motivation as the individual internal process that energizes, directs, and sustains 
behavior. It is the personal “force” that causes you or me to act in a particular way. For 
example, although job rotation may increase your job satisfaction and your enthusiasm 
for your work so that you devote more energy to it, job rotation may not have the 
same impact on me.
Morale is an employee’s attitude or feelings about the job, about superiors, and 
about the firm itself. To achieve organizational goals effectively, employees need more 
than the right raw materials, adequate facilities, and efficient equipment. High morale 
results mainly from the satisfaction of needs on the job or as a result of the job. One 
need that might be satisfied on the job is the need to be recognized as an important 
contributor to the organization. A need satisfied as a result of the job is the need for 
financial security. High morale, in turn, leads to dedication and loyalty, as well as to 
the desire to do the job well. Low morale, however, can lead to shoddy work, absen-
teeism, and high turnover rates as employees leave to seek more satisfying jobs with 
other firms. After the most recent recession, job turnover rates lowered as many people 
considered themselves lucky to have work. As the economy continues to recover, job 
turnover is again rising.2 To offset this turnover trend, companies are creating work 
environments focused on increasing employee satisfaction. One obvious indicator of 
satisfaction at a specific organization is whether employees like working there and 
whether other people want to work there. In a recent list of Fortune magazine’s “Top 
100 Companies to Work For,” the top ten best companies to work for were Google, 
Boston Consulting Group, SAS, Wegmans Food Markets, Edward Jones, Netapp, 
Camden Property Trust, REI Recreational Equipment, CHG Healthcare Services, and 
Quicken Loans.3 Motivation, morale, and the satisfaction of employees’ needs are thus 
intertwined. Along with productivity, they have been the subject of much study since 
the end of the 19th century. We continue our discussion of motivation by outlining 
some landmarks of the early research.
Historical Perspectives on Motivation
Researchers often begin a study with a fairly narrow goal in mind. After they develop 
an understanding of their subject, however, they realize that both their goal and their 
research should be broadened. This is exactly what happened when early research into 
productivity blossomed into the more modern study of employee motivation.
Scientific Management
Toward the end of the 19th century, Frederick W. Taylor became 
interested in improving the efficiency of individual workers. 
This interest, which stemmed from his own experiences in 
manufacturing plants, eventually led to scientific management, 
the application of scientific principles to management of work 
and workers.
One of Taylor’s first jobs was with the Midvale Steel Company 
in Philadelphia, where he developed a strong distaste for waste 
and inefficiency. He also observed a practice he called “soldier-
ing.” Workers “soldiered,” or worked slowly, because they feared 
that if they worked faster, they would run out of work and lose 
their jobs. Taylor realized that managers were not aware of this 
practice because they had no idea what the workers’ productivity 
levels should be.

Is anyone happy? A century ago, most businesses 
in the United States weren’t overly concerned about 
employee satisfaction. This is not the case today. Why 
do you think attitudes about employee motivation and 
satisfaction have changed?

internal process that energizes, 
directs, and sustains behavior; the 
personal “force” that causes you 
or me to behave in a particular 
way

piece-rate system  a 
compensation system under which 
employees are paid a certain 
amount for each unit of output 
they produce
Taylor later left Midvale and spent several years at Bethlehem Steel. While there, 
he made his most significant contribution to the field of motivation. He suggested 
that each job should be broken down into separate tasks. Then management should 
determine (1) the best way to perform each task and (2) the job output to expect when 
employees performed the tasks properly. Next, management should carefully choose 
the best person for each job and train that person in how to do the job properly. 
Finally, management should cooperate with workers to ensure that jobs were per-
formed as planned.
Taylor also developed the idea that most people work only to earn money. He 
therefore reasoned that pay should be tied directly to output. The more a person pro-
duced, the more he or she should be paid. This gave rise to the piece-rate system, 
under which employees are paid a certain amount for each unit of output they produce. 
Under Taylor’s piece-rate system, each employee was assigned an output quota. Those 
exceeding the quota were paid a higher per-unit rate for all units they produced (see 
Figure 10.1). Today, the piece-rate system is still used by some manufacturers and by 
farmers who grow crops that are harvested by farm laborers.
When Taylor’s system was put into practice at Bethlehem Steel, the results were 
dramatic. Average earnings per day for steel handlers rose from $1.15 to $1.88. (Do not 
let the low wages that prevailed at the time obscure the fact that this was an increase 
of more than 60 percent!) The average amount of steel handled per day increased from 
16 to 57 tons.
Taylor’s revolutionary ideas had a profound impact on management practice. 
However, his view of motivation was soon recognized as overly simplistic and nar-
row. It is true that most people expect to be paid for their work, but it is also true that 
people work for a variety of reasons other than pay. Therefore, simply increasing a 
person’s pay may not increase that person’s motivation or productivity.
The Hawthorne Studies
Between 1927 and 1932, Elton Mayo conducted two experiments at the Hawthorne 
plant of the Western Electric Company in Chicago. The original objective of these 
studies, now referred to as the Hawthorne Studies, was to determine the effects of the 
work environment on employee productivity.
In the first set of experiments, lighting in the workplace was varied for one group 
of workers but not for a second group. Then the productivities of both groups were 
measured to determine the effect of light. To the amazement of the researchers, produc-
tivity increased for both groups. For the group whose lighting was varied, productivity 
remained high until the light was reduced to the level of moonlight!
Workers who exceeded their quotas were rewarded with  
a higher rate per piece for all the pieces they produced.

need  a personal requirement
Maslow’s hierarchy of needs  a 
sequence of human needs in the 
order of their importance
physiological needs  the things 
we require for survival
safety needs  the things we 
require for physical and emotional 
security
The second set of experiments focused on the effectiveness of the piece-rate system 
in increasing the output of groups of workers. Researchers expected that output would 
increase because faster workers would put pressure on slower workers to produce 
more. Again, the results were not as expected. Output remained constant no matter 
what “standard” rates management set.
The researchers came to the conclusion that human factors were responsible for 
the results of the two experiments. In the lighting experiments, researchers had given 
both groups of workers a sense of involvement in their jobs merely by asking them to 
participate in the research. These workers—perhaps for the first time—felt as though 
they were an important part of the organization. In the piece-rate experiments, each 
group of workers informally set the acceptable rate of output for the group. To gain 
or retain the social acceptance of the group, each worker had to produce at that rate. 
Slower or faster workers were pressured to maintain the group’s pace.
The Hawthorne Studies showed that such human factors are at least as important 
to motivation as pay rates. From these and other studies, the human relations move-
ment in management was born. Its premise was simple: Employees who are happy and 
satisfied with their work are motivated to perform better. Hence, management is best 
served by providing a work environment that maximizes employee satisfaction.
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs
Abraham Maslow, an American psychologist whose best-known works were published 
in the 1960s and 1970s, developed a theory of motivation based on a hierarchy of needs. 
A need is a personal requirement. Maslow assumed that humans are “wanting” beings 
who seek to fulfill a variety of needs. He observed that these needs can be arranged 
according to their importance in a sequence now known as Maslow’s hierarchy of 
needs (see Figure 10.2).
At the most basic level are physiological needs, the things we require to survive. 
They include food and water, clothing, shelter, and sleep. In the employment context, 
these needs usually are satisfied through adequate wages.
At the next level are safety needs, the things we require for physical and emo-
tional security. Safety needs may be satisfied through job security, health insurance, 
pension plans, and safe working conditions. Many companies are facing increasing 
insurance premiums for employee health care. The rising costs of providing health 
care and retirement benefits are major issues for many firms and many have reduced 
medical coverage in order to keep costs low. These changes affect younger employ-
ees disproportionately. While previous generations often counted on relatively secure 
retirement packages, young people entering the workforce have no such guarantee.4
Psychologist Abraham Maslow believed  
that people act to fulfill five categories of needs.

Part 4   Human Resources
social needs  the human 
requirements for love and 
affection and a sense of belonging
esteem needs  our need for 
respect, recognition, and a sense 
of our own accomplishment and 
worth
self-actualization needs  the 
need to grow and develop and to 
become all that we are capable of 
being
Next are the social needs, the human requirements for love and affection and 
a sense of belonging. To an extent, these needs can be satisfied through relationships 
in the work environment and the informal organization. However, social networks 
beyond the workplace—with family and friends, for example—are needed, too. Many 
employers offer their workers flexible scheduling options in order to improve their 
quality of lives, which includes allowing time for family and friends. Employees who 
have flexible work schedules are more likely to be able to attend family events or 
to socialize. Because having a better balance makes people happier, an international 
survey by Accenture found that employees with flexible work schedules that address 
their social needs are more committed and less likely to leave their jobs.5
At the level of esteem needs, we require respect and recognition from others and 
a sense of our own accomplishment and worth (self-esteem). These needs may be satis-
fied through personal accomplishment, promotion to more responsible jobs, various 
honors and awards, and other forms of recognition.
At the top of the hierarchy are the self-actualization needs the need to grow, 
develop, and become all that we are capable of being. These are the most difficult needs 
to satisfy, and the means of satisfying them tend to vary with the individual. For some 
people, learning a new skill, starting a new career after retirement, or becoming “the 
best there is” at some endeavor may be the way to realize self-actualization.
Maslow suggested that people work to satisfy their physiological needs first, then 
their safety needs, and so on up the “needs ladder.” In general, they are motivated by 
the needs at the lowest level that remain unsatisfied. However, needs at one level do not 
have to be satisfied completely before needs at the next higher level come into play. If 
the majority of a person’s physiological and safety needs are satisfied, that person will 
be motivated primarily by social needs. However, any physiological and safety needs 
that remain unsatisfied also will be important.
Maslow’s hierarchy of needs provides a useful way of viewing employee motiva-
tion, as well as a guide for management. By and large, American business has been able 
to satisfy workers’ basic needs, but the higher-order needs present more of a challenge. 
These needs are not satisfied in a simple manner, and the means of satisfaction vary 
from one employee to another.
Herzberg’s Motivation–Hygiene Theory
In the late 1950s, Frederick Herzberg interviewed approximately 
200 accountants and engineers in Pittsburgh. During the interviews, 
he asked them to think of a time when they had felt especially good 
about their jobs and their work. Then he asked them to describe 
the factor or factors that had caused them to feel that way. Next, 
he did the same regarding a time when they had felt especially bad 
about their work. He was surprised to find that feeling good and 
feeling bad resulted from entirely different sets of factors; that is, 
low pay may have made a particular person feel bad, but it was 
some factor other than high pay that made that person feel good.
Satisfaction and Dissatisfaction  Before Herzberg’s interviews, 
the general assumption was that employee satisfaction and dissatis-
faction lay at opposite ends of the same scale. People felt satisfied, 
dissatisfied, or somewhere in between. However, Herzberg’s inter-
views convinced him that satisfaction and dissatisfaction may be 
different dimensions altogether. One dimension might range from 
satisfaction to no satisfaction, and the other might range from dis-
satisfaction to no dissatisfaction. In other words, the opposite of 
satisfaction is not dissatisfaction. The idea that satisfaction and 
What satisfies employees? Companies sometimes 
use travel awards as incentives for better employee 
performance. According to the motivation–hygiene 
theory, when an incentive for higher performance is not 
provided, is that a dissatisfier?

motivation–hygiene theory  the 
idea that satisfaction and 
dissatisfaction are separate and 
distinct dimensions
motivation factors  job factors 
that increase motivation, although 
their absence does not necessarily 
result in dissatisfaction
hygiene factors  job factors 
that reduce dissatisfaction when 
present to an acceptable degree 
but that do not necessarily result 
in high levels of motivation
dissatisfaction are separate and distinct dimensions is referred to as the motivation–
hygiene theory (see Figure 10.3).
The job factors that Herzberg found most frequently associated with satisfac-
tion were achievement, recognition, responsibility, advancement, growth, and the 
work itself. These factors generally are referred to as motivation factors because 
their presence increases motivation. However, their absence does not necessarily 
result in feelings of dissatisfaction. When motivation factors are present, they act 
as satisfiers.
Job factors cited as causing dissatisfaction were supervision, working conditions, 
interpersonal relationships, pay, job security, company policies, and administration. 
These factors, called hygiene factors, reduce dissatisfaction when they are present to 
an acceptable degree. However, they do not necessarily result in high levels of motiva-
tion. When hygiene factors are absent, they act as dissatisfiers.
Using Herzberg’s Motivation–Hygiene Theory  Herzberg provides explicit 
guidelines for using the motivation–hygiene theory of employee motivation. He sug-
gests that the hygiene factors must be present to ensure that a worker can function 
comfortably. He warns, however, that a state of no dissatisfaction never exists. In any 
situation, people always will be dissatisfied with something.
According to Herzberg, managers should make hygiene as positive as possible, but 
then should expect only short-term, rather than long-term, improvement in motivation. 
Managers must focus instead on providing those motivation factors that presumably 
will enhance motivation and long-term effort.
We should note that employee pay has more effect than Herzberg’s theory indi-
cates. He suggests that pay provides only short-term change and not true motiva-
tion. Yet, in many organizations, pay constitutes a form of recognition and reward 
for achievement—and recognition and achievement are both motivation factors. 
The effect of pay may depend on how it is distributed. If a pay increase does not 
depend on performance (as in across-the-board or cost-of-living raises), it may 
not motivate people. However, if pay is increased as a form of recognition (as in 
bonuses or incentives), it may play a powerful role in motivating employees to 
higher performance.
Theory X and Theory Y
The concepts of Theory X and Theory Y were advanced by Douglas McGregor in his 
book The Human Side of Enterprise. They are, in essence, sets of assumptions that 
underlie management’s attitudes and beliefs regarding workers’ behavior.
Herzberg’s theory takes into account that there are different dimensions to job 
satisfaction and dissatisfaction and that these factors do not overlap.

Part 4   Human Resources
Theory X  a concept of 
employee motivation generally 
consistent with Taylor’s scientific 
management; assumes that 
employees dislike work and will 
function only in a highly controlled 
work environment
Theory Y  a concept of employee 
motivation generally consistent 
with the ideas of the human 
relations movement; assumes 
responsibility and work toward 
organizational goals, and by doing 
so they also achieve personal 
rewards
Theory X is a concept of employee motivation generally consistent with Taylor’s 
scientific management. Theory X assumes that employees dislike work and will func-
tion effectively only in a highly controlled work environment.
Theory X is based on the following assumptions:
	 1.	People dislike work and try to avoid it.
	 2.	Because people dislike work, managers must coerce, control, and frequently 
threaten employees to achieve organizational goals.
	 3.	People generally must be led because they have little ambition and will not seek 
responsibility; they are concerned mainly about security.
The logical outcome of such assumptions will be a highly controlled work envi-
ronment—one in which managers make all the decisions and employees take all the 
orders.
On the other hand, Theory Y is a concept of employee motivation generally consis-
tent with the ideas of the human relations movement. Theory Y assumes that employ-
ees accept responsibility and work toward organizational goals, and by doing so they 
also achieve personal rewards. Theory Y is based on the following assumptions:
	 1.	People do not naturally dislike work; in fact, work is an important part of their 
lives.
	 2.	People will work toward goals to which they are committed.
	 3.	People become committed to goals when it is clear that accomplishing the goals 
will bring personal rewards.
	 4.	People often seek out and willingly accept responsibility.
	 5.	Employees have the potential to help accomplish organizational goals.
	 6.	Organizations generally do not make full use of their human resources.
Obviously, this view is quite different from—and much more positive than—that 
of Theory X. McGregor argued that most managers behave in accordance with Theory 
X, but he maintained that Theory Y is more appropriate and effective as a guide for 
managerial action (see Table 10.1).
The human relations movement and Theories X and Y increased managers’ aware-
ness of the importance of social factors in the workplace. However, human motivation 
is a complex and dynamic process to which there is no simple key. Neither money nor 
social factors alone can provide the answer. Rather, a number of factors must be con-
sidered in any attempt to increase motivation.
Theory Z
William Ouchi, a management professor at UCLA, studied business practices in 
American and Japanese firms. He concluded that different types of management 
systems dominate in these two countries.6 In Japan, Ouchi found what he calls type 
J firms. They are characterized by lifetime employment for employees, collective (or 
group) decision making, collective responsibility for the outcomes of decisions, slow

Theory Z  the belief that some 
middle ground between type A 
and type J practices is best for 
American business
reinforcement theory  a theory 
of motivation based on the 
premise that rewarded behavior 
is likely to be repeated, whereas 
punished behavior is less likely to 
recur
evaluation and promotion, implied control mechanisms, nonspecialized career paths, 
and a holistic concern for employees as people.
American industry is dominated by what Ouchi calls type A firms, which follow a 
different pattern. They emphasize short-term employment, individual decision making, 
individual responsibility for the outcomes of decisions, rapid evaluation and promo-
tion, explicit control mechanisms, specialized career paths, and a segmented concern 
for employees only as employees.
A few very successful American firms represent a blend of the type J and type A 
patterns. These firms, called type Z organizations, emphasize long-term employment, 
collective decision making, individual responsibility for the outcomes of decisions, slow 
evaluation and promotion, informal control along with some formalized measures, 
moderately specialized career paths, and a holistic concern for employees.
Ouchi’s Theory Z is the belief that some middle ground between his type A and 
type J practices is best for American business (see Figure 10.4). A major part of Theory 
Z is the emphasis on participative decision making. The focus is on “we” rather than 
on “us versus them.” Theory Z employees and managers view the organization as a 
family. This participative spirit fosters cooperation and the dissemination of informa-
tion and organizational values.
Reinforcement Theory
Reinforcement theory is based on the premise that behavior that is rewarded is 
likely to be repeated, whereas behavior that is punished is less likely to recur. A 
reinforcement is an action that follows directly from a particular behavior. It may 
be a pay raise after a particularly large sale to a new customer or a reprimand for 
coming to work late.
Reinforcements can take a variety of forms and can be used in a number of ways. A 
positive reinforcement is one that strengthens desired behavior by providing a reward. 
For example, many employees respond well to praise; recognition from their supervi-
sors for a job done well increases (strengthens) their willingness to perform well in 
the future. A negative reinforcement strengthens desired behavior by eliminating an 
undesirable task or situation. Suppose that a machine shop must be cleaned thoroughly 
every month—a dirty, miserable task. During one particular month when the workers 
do a less-than-satisfactory job at their normal work assignments, the boss requires the 
workers to clean the factory rather than bringing in the usual private maintenance 
service. The employees will be motivated to work harder the next month to avoid the 
unpleasant cleanup duty again.
The best aspects of Japanese and American management theories combine to form the nucleus of Theory Z.

Part 4   Human Resources
Punishment is an undesired consequence of unde-
sirable behavior. Common forms of punishment used 
in organizations include reprimands, reduced pay, dis-
ciplinary layoffs, and termination (firing). Punishment 
often does more harm than good. It tends to create an 
unpleasant environment, fosters hostility and resent-
ment, and suppresses undesirable behavior only until 
the supervisor’s back is turned.
Managers who rely on extinction hope to elimi-
nate undesirable behavior by not responding to it. The idea 
is that the behavior eventually will become “extinct.” Suppose, 
for example, that an employee writes memo after memo to his 
or her manager about insignificant events. If the manager does 
not respond to any of these memos, the employee probably will 
stop writing them, and the behavior will be squelched.
The effectiveness of reinforcement depends on which type 
is used and how it is timed. One approach may work best under 
certain conditions, although some situations lend themselves to 
the use of more than one approach. Generally, positive rein-
forcement is considered the most effective, and it is recom-
mended when the manager has a choice.
Continual reinforcement can become tedious for both 
managers and employees, especially when the same behavior is 
being reinforced over and over again in the same way. At the 
start, it may be necessary to reinforce a desired behavior every time it occurs. However, 
once a desired behavior has become more or less established, occasional reinforcement 
seems to be most effective.
Contemporary Views on Motivation
Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and Herzberg’s motivation–hygiene theory are popular 
and widely known theories of motivation. Each is also a significant step up from the 
relatively narrow views of scientific management and Theories X and Y. However, they 
do have one weakness: each attempts to specify what motivates people, but neither 
explains why or how motivation develops or is sustained over time. In recent years, 
managers have begun to explore three other models that take a more dynamic view of 
motivation. These are equity theory, expectancy theory, and goal-setting theory.
Equity Theory
The equity theory of motivation is based on the premise that people are motivated 
to obtain and preserve equitable treatment for themselves. As used here, equity is the 
distribution of rewards in direct proportion to each employee’s contribution to the 
organization. Everyone need not receive the same rewards, but the rewards should be 
in accordance with individual contributions.
According to this theory, we tend to implement the idea of equity in the following 
way. First, we develop our own input-to-outcome ratio. Inputs are the time, effort, skills, 
education, experience, and so on, that we contribute to the organization. Outcomes are the 
rewards we get from the organization, such as pay, benefits, recognition, and promotions. 
Next, we compare this ratio with what we perceive as the input-to-outcome ratio for some 
other person. It might be a co-worker, a friend who works for another firm, or even an 
average of all the people in our organization. This person is called the comparison other. 
Note that our perception of this person’s input-to-outcome ratio may be absolutely correct 
or completely wrong. However, we believe that it is correct.

expectancy theory  a model 
of motivation based on the 
assumption that motivation 
depends on how much we want 
something and on how likely we 
think we are to get it
If the two ratios are roughly the same, we feel that the organization is treating 
us equitably. In this case, we are motivated to leave things as they are. However, if 
our ratio is the higher of the two, we feel under-rewarded and are motivated to make 
changes. We may (1) decrease our own inputs by not working so hard, (2) try to 
increase our total outcome by asking for a raise in pay, (3) try to get the 
comparison other to increase some inputs or receive decreased outcomes, 
(4) leave the work situation, or (5) do a new comparison with a different 
comparison other.
Equity theory is most relevant to pay as an outcome. Because pay is 
a very real measure of a person’s worth to an organization, comparisons 
involving pay are a natural part of organizational life. Managers can try to 
avoid problems arising from inequity by making sure that rewards are dis-
tributed on the basis of performance and that everyone clearly understands 
the basis for his or her own pay.
Expectancy Theory
Expectancy theory, developed by Victor Vroom, is a very complex model of 
motivation based on a deceptively simple assumption. According to expectancy 
theory, motivation depends on how much we want something and on how 
likely we think we are to get it (see Figure 10.5). Consider, for example, the 
case of three sales representatives who are candidates for promotion to one 
sales manager’s job. Bill has had a very good sales year and always gets good 
performance evaluations. However, he is not sure that he wants the job because 
it involves a great deal of travel, long working hours, and much stress and 
pressure. Paul wants the job badly, but does not think he has much chance of 
getting it. He has had a terrible sales year and gets only mediocre performance 
evaluations from his present boss. Susan wants the job as much as Paul, and 
she thinks that she has a pretty good shot at it. Her sales have improved 
significantly this past year, and her evaluations are the best in the company.
Expectancy theory would predict that Bill and Paul are not very moti-
vated to seek the promotion. Bill does not really want it, and Paul does not

think that he has much of a chance of getting it. Susan, however, is very motivated to 
seek the promotion because she wants it and thinks that she can get it.
Expectancy theory is complex because each action we take is likely to lead to 
several different outcomes; some we may want, and others we may not want. For 
example, a person who works hard and puts in many extra hours may get a pay raise, 
be promoted, and gain valuable new job skills. However, that person also may be 
forced to spend less time with his or her family and be forced to cut back on his or 
her social life.
For one person, the promotion may be paramount, the pay raise and new skills 
fairly important, and the loss of family and social life of negligible importance. For 
someone else, the family and social life may be most important, the pay raise of mod-
erate importance, the new skills unimportant, and the promotion undesirable because 
of the additional hours it would require. The first person would be motivated to work 
hard and put in the extra hours, whereas the second person would not be motivated at 
all to do so. In other words, it is the entire bundle of outcomes—and the individual’s 
evaluation of the importance of each outcome—that determines motivation.
Expectancy theory is difficult to apply, but it does provide several useful guide-
lines for managers. It suggests that managers must recognize that (1) employees work 
for a variety of reasons; (2) these reasons, or expected outcomes, may change over 
time; and (3) it is necessary to clearly show employees how they 
can attain the outcomes they desire.
Goal-Setting Theory
Goal-setting theory suggests that employees are motivated to 
achieve goals that they and their managers establish together. The 
goal should be very specific, moderately difficult, and one that the 
employee will be committed to achieve.7 Rewards should be tied 
directly to goal achievement. Using goal-setting theory, a manager 
can design rewards that fit employee needs, clarify expectations, 
maintain equity, and provide reinforcement. For example, a manager 
might discover that one of her employees is very motivated by the 
occasional day off. Therefore, the manager and the employee may 
work out a plan together that involves giving the employee a free 
day as a reward after he completes a project satisfactorily and 
ahead of schedule, as long as he is up-to-date in his other work. A 
major benefit of this theory is that it provides a good understanding 
of the goal the employee has to achieve and the rewards that will 
accrue for the employee if the goal is accomplished.
Vroom’s theory is based on the idea that motivation depends on how much  
people want something and on how likely they think they are to get it.

management by objectives 
(MBO)  a motivation technique 
in which managers and employees 
collaborate in setting goals
Key Motivation Techniques
Today, it takes more than a generous salary to motivate employees. Increasingly, 
companies are trying to provide motivation by satisfying employees’ less-tangible 
needs. At times, businesses use simple, low- or no-cost approaches such as those listed 
in Table 10.2 to motivate workers. Organizations also use more complex approaches. 
In this section, we discuss several specific techniques that help managers to boost 
employee motivation and job satisfaction.
Management by Objectives
Management by objectives (MBO) is a motivation technique in which managers and 
employees collaborate in setting goals. The primary purpose of MBO is to clarify the 
roles employees are expected to play in reaching the organization’s goals.
By allowing individuals to participate in goal setting and performance evalua-
tion, MBO increases their motivation. Most MBO programs consist of a series of 
five steps. The first step in setting up an MBO program is to secure the acceptance 
of top management. It is essential that top managers endorse and participate in the 
program if others in the firm are to accept it. The commitment of top management 
also provides a natural starting point for educating employees about the purposes 
and mechanics of MBO.
Next, preliminary goals must be established. Top management also plays a major 
role in this activity because the preliminary goals reflect the firm’s mission and strat-
egy. The intent of an MBO program is to have these goals filter down through the 
organization.
The third step, which actually consists of several smaller steps, is the heart of 
MBO:
	 1.	The manager explains to each employee that he or she has accepted certain goals 
for the group (the manager as well as the employees) and asks the individual to 
think about how he or she can help to achieve these goals.
	 2.	The manager later meets with each employee individually. Together they establish 
goals for the employee. Whenever possible, the goals should be measurable and 
should specify the time frame for completion (usually one year).
	 3.	The manager and the employee decide what resources the employee will need to 
accomplish his or her goals.
As the fourth step, the manager and each employee meet periodically to review the 
employee’s progress. They may agree to modify certain goals during these meetings if 
circumstances have changed. For example, a sales representative may have accepted a 
goal of increasing sales by 20 percent. However, an aggressive competitor may have 
entered the marketplace, making this goal unattainable. In light of this circumstance, 
the goal may be revised downward to 10 or 15 percent.
The fifth step in the MBO process is evaluation. At the end of the designated time 
period, the manager and each employee meet again to determine which of the indi-
vidual’s goals were met and which were not met, and why. The employee’s reward (in 
the form of a pay raise, praise, or promotion) is based primarily on the degree of goal 
attainment.
As with every other management method, MBO has advantages and disadvan-
tages. MBO can motivate employees by involving them actively in the life of the firm. 
The collaboration on goal setting and performance appraisal improves communica-
tion and makes employees feel that they are an important part of the organization. 
Periodic review of progress also enhances control within an organization. A major 
problem with MBO is that it does not work unless the process begins at the top of an 
organization. In some cases, MBO results in excessive paperwork. Also, a manager may 
not like sitting down and working out goals with subordinates and may instead just 
assign them goals. Finally, MBO programs prove difficult to implement unless goals 
are quantifiable.

motivation.

job enrichment  a motivation 
technique that provides 
employees with more variety and 
responsibility in their jobs
job enlargement  expanding a 
worker’s assignments to include 
additional but similar tasks
Job Enrichment
Job enrichment is a method of motivating employees by providing them with variety 
in their tasks while giving them some responsibility for, and control over, their jobs. 
At the same time, employees gain new skills and acquire a broader perspective about 
how their individual work contributes to the goals of the organization. Earlier in 
this chapter, we noted that Herzberg’s motivation–hygiene theory is one rationale 
for the use of job enrichment; that is, the added responsibility and control that 
job enrichment confers on employees increases their satisfaction and motivation. 
For example, engineers at Google get to spend 20 percent of their time at work on 
projects of their choosing.8 This type of enrichment can motivate 
employees and create a variety of benefits for the company. At 
times, job enlargement, expanding a worker’s assignments to 
include additional but similar tasks, can lead to job enrichment. 
Job enlargement might mean that a worker on an assembly line 
who used to connect three wires to components moving down 
the line now connects five wires. Unfortunately, the added tasks 
often are just as routine as those the worker performed before 
the change. In such cases, enlargement may not be effective.
Whereas job enlargement does not really change the rou-
tine and monotonous nature of jobs, job enrichment does. Job 
enrichment requires that added tasks give an employee more 
responsibility for what he or she does. It provides workers with 
both more tasks to do and more control over how they perform 
them. In particular, job enrichment removes many controls from 
jobs, gives workers more authority, and assigns work in com-
plete, natural units. Moreover, employees frequently are given 
fresh and challenging job assignments. By blending more plan-
ning and decision making into jobs, job enrichment gives work 
more depth and complexity.

Job enlargement versus job enrichment. It’s no 
secret. Doing the same task over and over at your job is 
boring. Being able to do a variety of tasks helps. Having  
more responsibility over how you do your job is even 
better.

Are You Ready for Frequent Feedback?
© stoupa/Shutterstock
Will the usual yearly or twice-yearly 
employee performance review evolve into 
monthly or even daily feedback sessions 
to reinforce good performance and discourage 
less-productive actions? Some businesses find that employees 
actually welcome more frequent and less formal feedback than 
most organizations provide. Younger employees, in particular, 
are accustomed to texting, Tweeting, and other brief spurts 
of conversation, and they bring their expectations of quick 
response into the workplace. And in today’s rapidly changing 
business environment, companies don’t want employees to 
have to wait weeks or months for comments that will help 
them do a better job.
For example, managers at the social media site Facebook 
formally review employee performance two times a year. In 
addition, employees ask colleagues and managers for feedback 
and offer their own opinions when projects wrap up, after 
meetings, and after presentations. “You don’t have to schedule 
time with someone,” explains Facebook’s vice president of 
human resources. “It’s a 45-second conversation: ‘How did 
that go? What could be done better?’”
At Atlassian, an Australian software company, managers 
and employees discuss goals and performance every week, 
prompted by questions such as “How often have you stretched 
yourself?” As these firms know, getting a compliment or a 
suggestion for improvement at the right moment can make all 
the difference in reinforcing effective behavior.

enrichment in which work is

reinforcement to encourage 
desirable behavior
flextime  a system in which

limits
Job redesign is a type of job enrichment in which work is restructured in ways 
that cultivate the worker–job match. Job redesign can be achieved by combining tasks, 
forming work groups, or establishing closer customer relationships. Employees often 
are more motivated when jobs are combined because the increased variety of tasks 
presents more challenge and therefore more reward. Work groups motivate employees 
by showing them how their jobs fit within the organization as a whole and how they 
contribute to its success. Establishing client relationships allows employees to interact 
directly with customers. This type of redesign adds a personal dimension to employ-
ment. Another motivation for job redesign is to reduce employees’ stress at work. A 
job redesign that carefully matches worker to job can prevent stress-related injuries. 
Employees can sometimes play an active role in redesigning their jobs more to their 
liking. If an employee recognizes an opportunity at work to rework his or her job in 
such a way as to improve efficiency or productivity, he or she may want to approach a 
superior with the idea. Redesigning a position based around organizational needs may 
help improve employee satisfaction and reduce employee turnover—all while improv-
ing efficiency at the firm.9
Job enrichment works best when employees seek more challenging work. Of 
course, not all workers respond positively to job-enrichment programs. Employees 
must desire personal growth and have the skills and knowledge to perform enriched 
jobs. Lack of self-confidence, fear of failure, and distrust of management’s intentions 
are likely to lead to ineffective performance on enriched jobs. In addition, some work-
ers do not view their jobs as routine and boring, and others even prefer routine jobs 
because they find them satisfying. Companies that use job enrichment as an alternative 
to specialization also face extra expenses, such as the cost of retraining.
Behavior Modification
Behavior modification is a systematic program of reinforcement to encourage desirable 
behavior. Behavior modification involves both rewards to encourage desirable actions 
and punishments to discourage undesirable actions. However, studies have shown that 
rewards, such as compliments and expressions of appreciation, are much more effective 
behavior modifiers than punishments, such as reprimands and scorn.
When applied to management, behavior modification strives to encourage desir-
able organizational behavior. Use of this technique begins with identification of a target 
behavior—the behavior that is to be changed. (It might be low production levels or a 
high rate of absenteeism, for example.) Existing levels of this behavior are then mea-
sured. Next, managers provide positive reinforcement in the form of a reward when 
employees exhibit the desired behavior (such as increased production or less absentee-
ism). The reward might be praise or a more tangible form of recognition, such as a 
gift, meal, or trip. Apple created the Corporate Gifting and Rewards Program in order 
to give companies the ability to reward their staff with iPods, iPhones, iPads, Mac 
computers, or iTunes gift cards.10 Finally, the levels of the target behavior are measured 
again to determine whether the desired changes have been achieved. If they have been 
achieved, the reinforcement is maintained. However, if the target behavior has not 
changed significantly in the desired direction, the reward system must be changed to 
one that is likely to be more effective. The key is to devise effective rewards that will 
not only modify employees’ behavior in desired ways but also motivate them. To this 
end, experts suggest that management should reward quality, loyalty, and productivity.
Flextime
Flextime is a system in which employees set their own work hours within certain 
limits determined by employers. Typically, the firm establishes two bands of time: the 
core time, when all employees must be at work, and the flexible time, when employees 
may choose whether to be at work. The only condition is that every employee must 
work a total of eight hours each day. For example, the hours between 9 and 11 a.m. 
and 1 and 3 p.m. might be core times, and the hours between 6 and 9 a.m., 11 a.m. 
and 1 p.m., and 3 and 6 p.m. might be flexible times. This would give employees the

Another type of flextime allows employees to work a 40-hour work week in four days

off each week. Offering flextime can be a low-cost way for a firm to show an employee 
that it cares about his or her well-being through offering a better work–life balance.11 
The needs and lifestyles of today’s workforce are changing. Dual-income families make 
up a much larger share of the workforce than ever before, and women are one of its 
fastest-growing sectors. In addition, more employees are responsible for the care of 
elderly relatives. Recognizing that these changes increase the demand for family time, 
many employers are offering flexible work schedules that not only help employees to 
manage their time better but also increase employee motivation and job satisfaction. 
The sense of independence and autonomy employees gain from having a say in what 
hours they work can be a motivating factor. In addition, employees who have enough 
time to deal with non-work issues often work more productively and with greater 
satisfaction when they are on the job. Two common problems associated with using 
flextime are (1) supervisors sometimes find their jobs complicated by having employees 
who come and go at different times and (2) employees without flextime sometimes 
resent co-workers who have it.
To most people, a work schedule means the standard nine-to-five, 40-hour work 
week. In reality, though, some people have work schedules that are quite different 
from this. Flexible schedules are becoming much more common as improvements in 
technology allow people to stay connected, no matter where they are or what time it is. 
However, some industries are more likely to offer their workers flexible schedules than 
others. Medical and health, education and training, administrative jobs, and account-
ing are all likely to offer flexible schedule options. For example, many high-pressure 
accounting firms, such as Ernst & Young, have implemented flextime as a reward for 
working in an intense industry that requires some long hours during busy times. In 
order to offset the 60- or 70-hour work weeks during tax season, some accounting 
firms allow their employees to work 3-day weeks or take extended breaks during the 
summer. Flex policies like this help to reduce employee burnout and keep turnover low 
in what can be a stressful industry.12.
Part-Time Work and Job Sharing
Part-time work is permanent employment in which individuals 
work less than a standard work week. The specific number of 
hours worked varies, but part-time jobs are structured so that 
all responsibilities can be completed in the number of hours an 
employee works. Part-time work is of special interest to parents 
who want more time with their children and people who simply 
desire more leisure time. One disadvantage of part-time work is 
that it often does not provide the benefits that come with a full-time 
position. However, working without benefits is not always the case. 
A few large retailers do offer good benefit packages to part-time 
employees. Among the best firms for part-timers are REI, Land’s 
End, Starbucks, and Barnes & Noble. All of these organizations 
offer insurance packages to nearly all of their employees. Outfitter 
chain REI even offers its part-time employees incentive pay and 
the option to participate in a retirement and profit-sharing plan.13
Job sharing (sometimes referred to as work sharing) is an 
arrangement whereby two people share one full-time position. 
One job sharer may work from 8 a.m. to noon, and the other 
may work from 1 to 5 p.m., or they may alternate workdays. 
Job sharing is different than part-time work because two people 
share one single position, which is generally more skilled than a

Part-time pay, full-time benefits. Many employees 
want to work part-time but can’t afford not to have 
benefits such as health insurance.  Companies known 
for hiring part-time  employees with full benefits include 
UPS, REI, Land’s End, Starbucks, and Barnes & Noble.

part-time position would be. Job sharing can be dif-
ficult to orchestrate at the beginning, but may con-
tribute to greater job satisfaction and ease in creating 
work–life balance. Job sharing can actually lead people 
to be more productive, as they know that their time 
at work is limited and that someone else is directly 
depending on the quality of their work. This arrange-
ment may be especially appealing to parents who wish 
to maintain a professional position while also making 
time for children.14 Job sharing combines the security of a 
full-time position with the flexibility of a part-time job. For 
firms, job sharing provides a unique opportunity to attract 
highly skilled employees who might not be available on a full-
time basis. In addition, companies can save on expenses by 
reducing the cost of benefits and avoiding the disruptions of 
employee turnover. For employees, opting for the flexibility of 
job sharing may mean giving up some of the benefits received 
for full-time work. In addition, job sharing is difficult if tasks 
are not easily divisible or if two people do not work or com-
municate well with one another.
Telecommuting
A growing number of companies allow telecommuting, 
working at home all the time or for a portion of the work 
week. Email, cloud computing; smart phones, laptops, and 
tablets; video conferencing, and overnight couriers all 
facilitate the work-at-home trend. Working at home means 
that individuals can set their own hours and have more time 
with their families. A Cisco study reports that a full 45 percent 
of the United States workforce has a position that is suitable 
for telecommuting at least part of the time. A survey by the 
software company Wrike reveals that 83 percent of workers 
now do some work from home each day. Nevertheless, workers 
who do telecommute remain concerned that lack of in-person 
time with their superiors will hurt their careers.15
Technological advances have been so great that even CEOs are spending more 
time telecommuting. CEOs have found that they can be more effective and save 
time by occasionally touching base with staff virtually, via email, text message, 
or video chats, rather than having long face-to-face meetings. Increasingly, CEOs 
spend time on social media and other digital sites, monitoring competition and 
getting ideas.16
Companies that allow telecommuting experience several benefits, including 
increased productivity, lower real estate and travel costs, reduced employee absentee-
ism and turnover, increased work–life balance, improved morale, and access to addi-
tional labor pools. Telecommuting also helps improve the community by decreasing 
air pollutants, reducing traffic congestion, and lowering consumption of fossil fuels, 
which can give a company a green factor. Also, by having fewer employees commuting 
to work, the Reason Public Policy Institute estimates that approximately 350 lives are 
saved per year. Of all the companies that give employees the option to telecommute or 
work from home, Cisco is ranked number one with 90 percent of its employees classi-
fied as “regular” telecommuters.17
Among the disadvantages of telecommuting are feelings of isolation, putting in 
longer hours, and being distracted by family or household responsibilities. Although 
most bosses say that they trust their staff to work from home, many think that home 
workers are work-shy and less productive than office-based staff. In addition, some 
supervisors have difficulty monitoring productivity.

and using carpool lanes while they earn cash rewards. 
The program pays employees $4 per day for not driving 
to work alone or $4 per passenger per day for the drivers 
of carpools and vanpools. The company also offers free 
bus service, pre-tax transportation payroll deductions, and 
a company subsidy for commuting expenses, all designed 
to help employees avoid stress and traffic and protect the

empowerment  making 
employees more involved in 
their jobs by increasing their 
participation in decision making
employee ownership  a situation 
in which employees own the

being stockholders
Cisco, for example, is an industry leader at providing a virtual 
work environment. Approximately 85 percent of the company’s 
37,000-member U.S. workforce connects to the company remotely 
on a regular basis. Cisco’s employees use many of the company’s 
own products, including WebEx and TelePresence, which allow 
employees to attend meetings, do training, and hold video confer-
ences online. Cisco’s telecommuting program has boosted employee 
satisfaction, reduced turnover, and earned the company numerous 
sustainability awards. Telecommuting has saved the company over 
$277 million and lowers employees’ fuel costs by an estimated $10 
million annually.18
Employee Empowerment
Many companies are increasing employee motivation and satisfaction 
through the use of empowerment. Empowerment means making 
employees more involved in their jobs and in the operations of the 
organization by increasing their participation in decision making. 
With empowerment, control no longer flows exclusively from the 
top level of the organization downward. Empowered employees 
have a voice in what they do and how and when they do it. In some 
organizations, employees’ input is restricted to individual choices, 
such as when to take breaks. In other companies, their responsibilities may encompass 
more far-reaching issues. Successful companies tend to treat their employees like assets. 
Rather than forcing everyone to conform to an assigned role, empowered employees 
feel fully utilized and their responsibilities shift with the firm’s needs. Technology clearly 
plays a role in empowering employees, but so does creating an open and safe workplace 
where employees feel like they can speak up and be heard. Allowing employees access 
to information can empower them and make them feel more satisfied with their jobs. 
For example, the SAP Developer Network works like a social networking site, in that 
it links employees together, but it also provides a wealth of other information and 
interactive platforms that allow employees to share their knowledge and contribute to 
the company.19
For empowerment to work effectively, management must be involved. Managers 
should set expectations, communicate standards, institute periodic evaluations, and 
guarantee follow-up. If effectively implemented, empowerment can lead to increased 
job satisfaction, improved job performance, higher self-esteem, and increased orga-
nizational commitment. Obstacles to empowerment include resistance on the part of 
management, distrust of management on the part of workers, insufficient training, and 
poor communication between management and employees.
Employee Ownership
Some organizations are discovering that a highly effective technique for motivating 
employees is employee ownership—that is, employees own the company they work for 
by virtue of being stockholders. Employee-owned businesses directly reward employees 
for success. When the company enjoys increased sales or lower costs, employees benefit 
directly. The National Center for Employee Ownership, an organization that studies 
employee-owned American businesses, reports that employee stock ownership plans 
(ESOPs) provide considerable employee incentive and increase employee involvement 
and commitment. In the United States today, about 14 million employees participate 
in 11,500 ESOPs and stock bonus plans.20 As a means to motivate top executives and, 
frequently, middle-ranking managers who are working long days for what are generally 
considered poor salaries, some firms provide stock options as part of the employee 
compensation package. The option is simply the right to buy shares of the firm within 
a prescribed time at a set price. If the firm does well and its stock price rises past the set 
price (presumably because of all the work being done by the employee), the employee can 
exercise the option and immediately sell the stock and cash in on the company’s success.
Office space—at home. More companies are finding 
it cost-effective to allow employees to work at home. 
Working at home means that Nancy Allor can spend 
more time with her daughter Carrie. Telecommuting 
arrangements such as this can be a win-win situation 
for both employees and their firms.

ESOPs are not right for every company because they can be complex and expen-
sive. For example, Lowe’s decided to stop its ESOP and transferred the balance into 
a more traditional 401(k) plan instead. However, an ESOP can give some employees 
a feeling of having a stake in their workplace. Birkenstock, for example, has been 
employee-owned since the late 1970s. REI also has a popular ESOP.21
Teams and Teamwork
The concepts of teams and teamwork may be most commonly associated with sports, 
but they are also integral parts of business organizations. This organizational structure 
is popular because it encourages employees to participate more fully in business 
decisions. The growing number of companies organizing their workforces into teams 
reflects an effort to increase employee productivity and creativity because team 
members are working on specific goals and are given greater autonomy. This leads 
to greater job satisfaction as employees feel more involved in the 
management process.22
What Is a Team?
In a business organization, a team is two or more workers 
operating as a coordinated unit to accomplish a specific task or 
goal.23 A team may be assigned any number of tasks or goals, 
from development of a new product to selling that product. A 
team can also be created to identify or solve a problem that an 
organization is experiencing. Kotter International, an organization 
that specializes in helping other firms implement their strategic 
initiatives, believes in utilizing teams of volunteers from within 
an organization to assist in implementing change and problem 
solving. John Kotter recommends assembling a diverse team, with 
different viewpoints, skills, and experience-levels represented. 
Members need to be good at working with others and open to 
others’ ideas.24 Although teamwork may seem like a simple concept 
learned on soccer or football fields, teams function as a microcosm 
of the larger organization. Therefore, it is important to understand 
the types, development, and general nature of teams.
Types of Teams
There are several types of teams within businesses that function in 
specific ways to achieve different purposes, including problem-solving 
teams, self-managed teams, cross-functional teams, and virtual teams.
Problem-Solving Teams  The most common type of team in business organizations 
is the problem-solving team. It is generally used temporarily in order to bring knowl-
edgeable employees together to tackle a specific problem. Once the problem is solved, 
the team typically is disbanded.
Self-Managed Work Teams  Self-managed teams are groups of employees with 
the authority and skills to manage themselves. Experts suggest that workers on self-
managed teams are more motivated and satisfied because they have more task variety 
and job control. On many work teams, members rotate through all the jobs for which 
the team is responsible. Some organizations cross-train the entire team so that every-
one can perform everyone else’s job. In a traditional business structure, management is 
responsible for hiring and firing employees, establishing budgets, purchasing supplies, 
conducting performance reviews, and taking corrective action. When self-managed 
teams are in place, they take over some or all of these management functions. Xerox, 
Procter & Gamble, Ferrari, and numerous other companies have used self-managed

are allowing employees continents away from one 
another to work together effectively. Being able to  hire 
the best employees from all around the globe to work 
virtually with one  another can give a firm a competitive 
advantage. Virtual teams located in different time zones 
and on different continents can also enable a company 
to work on important projects 24-7.

specialties, expertise, and skills 
that are brought together to 
achieve a common task

teams successfully. The major advantages and disadvantages of self-managed teams are 
mentioned in Figure 10.6.
Cross-Functional Teams  Traditionally, businesses have organized employees into 
departments based on a common function or specialty. However, increasingly, business 
organizations are faced with projects that require a diversity of skills not available within 
a single department. A cross-functional team consists of individuals with varying spe-
cialties, expertise, and skills that are brought together to achieve a common task. For 
example, a purchasing agent might create a cross-functional team with representatives 
from various departments to gain insight into useful purchases for the company. This struc-
ture avoids departmental separation and allows greater efficiency when there is a single 
goal. Although cross-functional teams are not necessarily self-managed, most self-managed 
teams are cross-functional. Cross-functional teams can also be cross-divisional. By 2008, 
Ford Motor Company, along with other major automakers and their suppliers, were strug-
gling. Making sure the company had parts to build vehicles was a critical component of 
rebounding from disaster, but their supply chain was on the verge of failing. In order to 
rethink its supply chain and improve efficiency, Ford VP of Global Purchasing Tony Brown 
set up a cross-functional team, which included representatives from all business units and 
all departments. These individuals were put in charge of monitoring parts manufacturers, 
preventing supply chain disruptions, and helping in efforts to shrink Ford’s supply base. 
This team got together every day and worked long into the night, but they were able to 
address many of Ford’s problems and helped to speed the automaker’s recovery.25
Virtual Teams  With the advent of sophisticated communications technology, it is 
no longer necessary for teams to be geographically close. A virtual 
team consists of members who are geographically dispersed but 
communicate electronically. In fact, team members may never meet 
in person but rely solely on e-mail, teleconferences, faxes, voice 
mail, and other technological interactions. In the modern global 
environment, virtual teams connect employees on a common task 
across continents, oceans, time zones, and organizations. For exam-
ple, Mozilla, the software provider responsible for Firefox, regularly 
requests the help of volunteers to test and improve their products 
virtually. Some of these volunteers become employees of the organi-
zation based on their performance in the project they did.26 In some 
cases, the physical distances between participants and the lack of 
face-to-face interaction can be difficult when deadlines approach or 
communication is not clear.
Developing and Using Effective Teams
When a team is first developed, it takes time for the members 
to establish roles, relationships, delegation of duties, and other 
attributes of an effective team. As a team matures, it passes through 
five stages of development, as shown in Figure 10.7.
While self-managed teams provide advantages, managers must  
recognize their disadvantages.
ADVANTAGES
• Boosts employee morale
• Increases productivity
• Aids innovation
• Reduces employee boredom
DISADVANTAGES
• Additional training costs
• Teams may be disorganized
• Conﬂicts may arise
• Leadership role may be unclear

Part 4   Human Resources
When attempting to develop 
teams, managers must 
understand that multiple 
stages are generally required.
Figure 10.7	
Stages of Team 
Development
FORMING
The team is new.
Members get to know
each other.
STORMING
The team may be
volatile. Goals and
objectives are
developed.
NORMING
The team stabilizes.
Roles and duties are
accepted and
recognized.
PERFORMING
The team is dynamic.
Everyone makes a
focused effort to
accomplish goals.
ADJOURNING
The team is ﬁnished.
The goals have been
accomplished and
the team is disbanded.
Forming  In the first stage, forming, team members are introduced to one another and 
begin to develop a social dynamic. The members of the team are still unsure about how 
to relate to one another, what behaviors are considered acceptable, and what the ground 
rules are for the team. Through group member interaction over time, team members 
become more comfortable and a group dynamic begins to emerge.
Storming  During the storming stage, the interaction may be volatile and the 
team may lack unity. Because the team is still relatively new, this is the stage at 
which goals and objectives begin to develop. Team members will brainstorm to 
develop ideas and plans and establish a broad-ranging agenda. It is important at 
this stage for team members to grow more comfortable around the others so that 
they can contribute openly. At this time, the leadership role likely will be formally 
undefined. A team member may emerge as the informal leader. The success or 
failure of the ideas in storming determines how long the team will take to reach 
the next stage.
Norming  After storming and the first large burst of activity, the team begins to 
stabilize during the norming stage. During this process, each person’s role within the 
group starts to become apparent, and members begin to recognize the roles of others. 
A sense of unity will become stronger. If it has not occurred already, an identified 
leader will emerge. The group still may be somewhat volatile at this point and may 
regress back to the second stage if any conflict, especially over the leadership role, 
occurs.
Performing  The fourth stage, performing, is when the team achieves its full poten-
tial. It is usually slow to develop and occurs when the team begins to focus strongly on 
the assigned task and away from team-development issues. The members of the team 
work in harmony under the established roles to accomplish the necessary goals.
Adjourning  In the final stage, adjourning, the team is disbanded because the project 
has been completed. Team members may be reassigned to other teams or tasks. This 
stage does not always occur if the team is placed together for a task with no specific 
date of completion. For example, a marketing team for Best Buy may continue to 
develop promotional efforts for a store even after a specific promotional task has been 
accomplished. This stage is especially common in problem-solving teams that are dis-
mantled after the assigned problem has been resolved.
Roles Within a Team
Within any team, each member has a role to play in helping the team attain its 
objectives. Each of these roles adds important dimensions to team member interactions. 
The group member who pushes forward toward goals and places the objective first 
plays the task-specialist role by concentrating fully on the assigned task. In a cross-
functional team, this might be the person with the most expertise relating to the 
current task. The socioemotional role is played by the individual who supports 
and encourages the emotional needs of the other members. This person places the 
team members’ personal needs over the task of the team. Although this may sound 
unimportant, the socioemotional member’s dedication to team cohesiveness will 
lead to greater unity and higher productivity. The leader of the team, and possibly 
others as well, will play a dual role. This dual role is a combination of both the 
socioemotional and task-specialist roles because this individual focuses on both the 
task and the team. The team leader might not always play a dual role, but the team 
is likely to be most successful when he or she does. Sometimes an individual assumes 
the nonparticipant role. This role behavior is characterized by a person who does 
not contribute to accomplishing the task and does not provide favorable input with 
respect to team members’ socioemotional needs.

Chapter 10   Motivating and Satisfying Employees and Teams	
295
Team Cohesiveness
Developing a unit from a diverse group of personalities, 
specialties, backgrounds, and work styles can be 
challenging and complicated. In a cohesive team, 
the members get along and are able to accomplish 
their tasks effectively. There are factors that affect 
cohesiveness within a team. Teams generally are ideal 
when they contain five to 12 people. Teams with 
fewer than five people often fail to accomplish tasks 
and generate a variety of ideas. Teams with more than 12 
are too large because members do not develop relationships, 
may feel intimidated to speak, or may disconnect. It also may 
be beneficial to have team members introduce themselves 
and describe their past work experiences. This activity 
will foster familiarity and shared experiences. One of the 
most reliable ways to build cohesiveness within a team is 
through competition with other teams. When two teams are 
competing for a single prize or recognition, they are forced 
to put aside conflict and accomplish their goal. By adding 
an incentive to finishing the task, the team automatically 
becomes more goal oriented. Also, a favorable appraisal from 
an outsider may strengthen team cohesiveness. Because the 
team is being praised as a group, team members recognize 
their contribution as a unit. Teams are also more successful 
when goals have been agreed upon. A team that is clear 
about its objective will focus more on accomplishing it. 
Frequent interaction also builds cohesiveness as relationships 
strengthen and familiarity increases.
Team Conflict and How to Resolve It
Conflict occurs when a disagreement arises between two or more team members. 
Conflict traditionally has been viewed as negative; however, if handled properly, 
conflict can work to improve a team. For example, if two team members disagree 
about a certain decision, both may analyze the situation more closely to determine 
the best choice. As long as conflict is handled in a respectful and professional 
manner, it can improve the quality of work produced. However, if conflict turns 
hostile and affects the work environment, then steps must be taken to arrive at 
a suitable compromise. Compromises can be difficult in a business organization 
because neither party ends up getting everything he or she wants. The best solution 
is a middle-ground alternative in which each party is satisfied to some degree. It 
is best to avoid attempting to minimize or ignore conflicts within a group because 
this may cause the conflict to grow as members concentrate on the problem instead 
of the task. However the conflict is resolved, it is important to remember that 
conflict must be acknowledged if it is to either be resolved or serve a constructive 
purpose.
Benefits and Limitations of Teams
Teamwork within a company has been credited as a key to reducing turnover and 
costs and increasing production, quality, and customer service. There is also evidence 
that working in teams leads to higher levels of job satisfaction among employees and 
a harmonious work environment. Thus, an increasingly large number of companies 
are considering teams as a viable organizational structure. However, the process of 
reorganizing into teams can be stressful and time consuming with no guarantee that 
the team will develop effectively. If a team lacks cohesiveness and is unable to resolve 
conflict, the company may experience lower productivity.

Thanks to all the technology in your pocket and on your 
desk, it’s a small world after all. Friends, family, and 
coworkers are never more than a text message, e-mail, or 
Skype conversation away. Virtual teams also rely on these 
and other technologies to stay in touch.

Part 4   Human Resources
Explain what motivation is.
Motivation is the individual internal process that energizes, 
directs, and sustains behavior. Motivation is affected by 
employee morale—that is, the employee’s feelings about the 
job, superiors, and the firm itself. Motivation, morale, and 
job satisfaction are closely related.
Understand some major historical perspectives 
on motivation.
One of the first approaches to employee motivation was 
Frederick Taylor’s scientific management, the application of 
scientific principles to the management of work and workers. 
Taylor believed that employees work only for money and 
that they must be closely supervised and managed. This 
thinking led to the piece-rate system, under which employees 
are paid a certain amount for each unit they produce. The 
Hawthorne Studies attempted to determine the effects of the 
work environment on productivity. Results of these studies 
indicated that human factors affect productivity more than 
do physical aspects of the workplace.
Maslow’s hierarchy of needs suggests that people are moti-
vated by five sets of needs. In ascending order of importance, 
these motivators are physiological, safety, social, esteem, and 
self-actualization needs. People are motivated by the lowest 
set of needs that remains unfulfilled. As needs at one level are 
satisfied, people try to satisfy needs at the next level.
Frederick Herzberg found that job satisfaction and dis-
satisfaction are influenced by two distinct sets of factors. 
Motivation factors, including recognition and responsibility, 
affect an employee’s degree of satisfaction, but their absence 
does not necessarily cause dissatisfaction. Hygiene factors, 
including pay and working conditions, affect an employee’s 
degree of dissatisfaction but do not affect satisfaction.
Theory X is a concept of motivation that assumes that 
employees dislike work and will function effectively only 
in a highly controlled work environment. Thus, to achieve 
an organization’s goals, managers must coerce, control, and 
threaten employees. This theory generally is consistent with 
Taylor’s ideas of scientific management. Theory Y is more 
in keeping with the results of the Hawthorne Studies and 
the human relations movement. It suggests that employees 
can be motivated to behave as responsible members of the 
organization. Theory Z emphasizes long-term employment, 
collective decision making, individual responsibility for the 
outcomes of decisions, informal control, and a holistic con-
cern for employees. Reinforcement theory is based on the 
idea that people will repeat behavior that is rewarded and 
will avoid behavior that is punished.
Describe three contemporary views of motivation: 
equity theory, expectancy theory, and goal-
setting theory.
Equity theory maintains that people are motivated to obtain 
and preserve equitable treatment for themselves. Expectancy 
theory suggests that our motivation depends on how much 
we want something and how likely we think we are to get it. 
Goal-setting theory suggests that employees are motivated to 
achieve a goal that they and their managers establish together.

Summary
Inside
Business
REI has a long history of showing employees that they 
matter, which in turn boosts motivation and job satisfac-
tion. The retailer rewards team accomplishments, such 
as outstanding store sales results, and also recognizes 
individual achievements, through programs such as the 
“Going the Extra Mile” award. Employees nominate their 
colleagues for the Anderson Award, an honor named for 
one of REI’s founders. After each store or division votes, 
the winners are brought to headquarters for a three-day 
celebration and a ceremony in which they receive REI’s 
“rock of fame.”
REI gauges involvement and satisfaction through an 
annual employee survey, and then publishes the results 
internally for follow-up by action teams in stores and at 
the division level. Seeking to reach and then exceed $2 
billion in annual revenue, the retailer is empowering indi-
vidual employees and stores to serve and inspire their 
customers and their communities—in environmentally 
friendly ways.
Questions
1.	 How is REI fulfilling a variety of employee needs 
within Maslow’s hierarchy, and why is this important?
2.	 Which specific aspects of teamwork are likely to be 
affected when employees hike or bike together before 
a new store opens?

Chapter 10   Motivating and Satisfying Employees and Teams	
297
Explain several techniques for increasing 
employee motivation.
Management by objectives (MBO) is a motivation technique 
in which managers and employees collaborate in setting goals. 
MBO motivates employees by getting them more involved in 
their jobs and in the organization as a whole. Job enrichment 
seeks to motivate employees by varying their tasks and giving 
them more responsibility for and control over their jobs. Job 
enlargement, expanding a worker’s assignments to include 
additional tasks, is one aspect of job enrichment. Job redesign 
is a type of job enrichment in which work is restructured to 
improve the worker–job match.
Behavior modification uses reinforcement to encourage 
desirable behavior. Rewards for productivity, quality, and 
loyalty change employees’ behavior in desired ways and also 
increase motivation.
Allowing employees to work more flexible hours is 
another way to build motivation and job satisfaction. Flextime 
is a system of work scheduling that allows workers to set their 
own hours as long as they fall within the limits established 
by employers. Part-time work is permanent employment in 
which individuals work less than a standard work week. Job 
sharing is an arrangement whereby two people share one full-
time position. Telecommuting allows employees to work at 
home all or part of the work week. All of these types of work 
arrangements give employees more time outside the work-
place to deal with family responsibilities or to enjoy free time.
Employee empowerment, self-managed work teams, and 
employee ownership are also techniques that boost employee 
motivation. Empowerment increases employees’ involvement 
in their jobs by increasing their decision-making authority. 
Self-managed work teams are groups of employees with the 
authority and skills to manage themselves. When employees 
participate in ownership programs, such as employee stock 
ownership plans (ESOPs), they have more incentive to make 
the company succeed and therefore work more effectively.
Understand the types, development, and uses of 
teams.
A large number of companies use teams to increase their 
employees’ productivity. In a business organization, a team is 
a group of workers functioning together as a unit to complete 
a common goal or purpose.
There are several types of teams within businesses that func-
tion in specific ways to achieve different purposes. A problem-
solving team is a team of knowledgeable employees brought 
together to tackle a specific problem. A virtual team is a team 
consisting of members who are geographically dispersed but 
communicate electronically. A cross-functional team is a team of 
individuals with varying specialties, expertise, and skills.
The five stages of team development are forming, storm-
ing, norming, performing, and adjourning. As a team devel-
ops, it should become more productive and unified. The four 
roles within teams are task specialist, socioemotional, dual, 
and nonparticipative. Each of these roles plays a specific part 
in the team’s interaction. For a team to be successful, mem-
bers must learn how to resolve and manage conflict so that 
the team can work cohesively to accomplish goals.

Discussion Questions
From a tiny mail-order company begun 100 years ago, L.L.Bean 
has grown into a well-known retail firm with net sales of over $1.5 
billion a year. It encompasses 14 stores in 10 states, continues its 
ever-popular catalog, has a thriving online store, and sells some 
20,000 high-quality items, including clothing for the whole family, 
accessories, outdoor and camping gear, and even luggage, linens, 
and furniture. Employees at L.L.Bean share a sense of purpose 
that closely reflects the values of the company’s founders and 
managers, making them feel like they are part of a large family.
Although its online store has grown enormously in popular-
ity, the company continues to field a huge number of mail and 
telephone orders year-round, which puts employees in constant 
direct contact with customers. The company has a world-class 
training program, so employees’ skills are not an issue. In addi-
tion, employees’ motivation brought the company to the top of 
BusinessWeek’s list of companies with outstanding customer service. 
Why are they so motivated? “Our frontline employees are the face 
of L.L.Bean and the voice of L.L.Bean to our customers,” says the 
company’s vice president of e-commerce, “so they need to feel that 
they’re supported in making the right decisions on behalf of the 
customer and the company.” Describing the way many other firms 
require their telephone call center employees to bring in a supervi-
sor to resolve customers’ problems, the vice president explains why 
L.L.Bean does things differently. “We expect that the person you 
talk to on the phone will make it right. Other places you have to 
say, ‘Let me talk to your supervisor,’ and we really can’t stand that. 
We look on elevated calls as a bad thing.”
Empowering employees to resolve customer problems on their 
own not only speeds the handling of calls and leaves L.L.Bean’s 
customers more satisfied, it also increases employees’ decision-
making authority and the pride and satisfaction they feel in their 
work. The company offers annual bonuses and profit sharing 
for all year-round employees. However, as one company execu-
tive explained, the sense of ownership Bean employees feel in the 
company isn’t founded on money. “It’s definitely not based on 
that kind of incentive. . . . We select employees based on their 
ability to feel that kind of ownership, based on their investment in 
delivering the right customer experience. . . . They have this sort 
of underlying sense of values that drives them to deliver and . . . 
act as if they are an owner of the company. I talk about that a lot 
with my frontline employees.”
Communication at the firm goes both ways. L.L.Bean employ-
ees also know they are empowered to speak up when they think a 
product or a business process can be improved. As one manager 
says, “They would be very clear to the chain of command that 
‘this doesn’t work, and you need to change it so that it better 
suits the customer.’”
Other ways in which L.L.Bean rewards its employees are the 
company-owned fitness centers, walking trails, and sporting camps 
for fishing, kayaking, and skiing that encourage everyone at the 
firm to stay healthy and active. Ergonomic workstations bring the 
company’s commitment to its employees’ well-being right to their 
desks. During his tenure as president, in fact, Leon Gorman defined 
the company’s stakeholders as including not just customers, stock-
holders, vendors, communities, and the natural environment, but 
employees as well. Benefits, wages, discounts, and pensions are 
competitive, even generous. Some employees have worked for the 
company for as long as 30 years, and nearly 800 applicants turned 
out for 130 jobs created by the opening of a new L.L.Bean store 
in upstate New York. It all comes back to what Gorman calls the 
power of L.L.’s personality: “His personal charisma, based on 
down-home honesty, a true love for the outdoors, and a genuine 
enthusiasm for people inspired all who worked for him.” In that 
respect, the founder’s legacy is very much alive today.27
Questions
	 1.	 What role do you think empowerment plays at L.L.Bean?
	 2.	 Because the company’s retail Web site has proven to be so 
successful, L.L.Bean recently announced the closing of one 
of its four call centers, but the 220 employees there will have 
the option to work at another site or telecommute. What 
net effect do you think closing of the call center will have on 
employee morale and motivation?
	 3.	 What else could L.L.Bean do to motivate its employees?

Chapter 10   Motivating and Satisfying Employees and Teams	
299
Can a company that makes employee satisfaction its top priority 
achieve long-term success? Kip Tindell has been doing this since 
1978, when he opened the first Container Store in Texas to sell 
all kinds of containers, from bins and baskets to hooks and shelf 
hardware. Today, The Container Store has grown into a $650 
million company with 55 stores in 22 states and the District of 
Columbia. Even with a workforce of 5,000 people, Tindell still 
insists on putting his employees first. “If you really, truly take bet-
ter care of your employees, they’ll take better care of the custom-
ers,” he explains. In line with this philosophy, The Container Store 
refused to lay off employees during the recent recession, which 
won it public praise and reinforced its employees-first reputation.
The Container Store starts by hiring outstanding, enthusiastic 
employees who genuinely want to help customers solve their stor-
age problems by selecting products to organize closets, rooms, 
garages, or work spaces. To attract employees of this caliber, the 
company pays higher salaries than the typical retailer. It also gives 
new full-time employees 263 hours of training during their first 
year on the job (part-timers receive 150 hours of training during 
their first year). Managers receive an additional five weeks’ train-
ing in personnel management, operations, and leadership.
Training covers not only product knowledge but also the com-
pany’s basic principles, such as “communication is leadership”—
the idea that sharing information with employees gives them the 
tools they need to make good decisions on the job. Another basic 
principle is that both employees and customers benefit from the 
“air of excitement” the retailer creates in every store, making every 
shopping trip a fun experience for all. Instead of imposing a thick 
manual of policies and procedures, The Container Store encour-
ages its employees to apply these principles and use their good 
judgment to solve problems and satisfy customers.
Following a path of gradual, deliberate expansion, The 
Container Store opens only one or two new stores per year. As 
it grows, the company promotes primarily from within, giving 
managers and employees plenty of opportunity for professional 
development and additional responsibility. It’s not unusual for an 
employee to start on the selling floor and work up to managing 
the local store before transferring to a larger store or supervising 
the grand opening of a store in a new market.
The Container Store has been honored 13 times with a spot 
on Fortune’s annual list of the 100 best U.S. firms to work for. It 
regularly appears on “best employer” lists in many cities where 
it operates stores. Thanks to its great reputation, the company 
receives more than 52,000 job applications every year. Many 
applicants are referred by current employees or have shopped 
in the stores and want to work in one. Applications also come 
through The Container Store’s Facebook page, which has 
100,000 “likes” and a special section featuring career informa-
tion. The company is so choosy that fewer than 3 percent of the 
applicants make it through the rigorous selection process and 
receive a job offer.
Once hired, employees are so satisfied that fewer than 10 per-
cent leave in any given year. This puts The Container Store in a 
class of its own, because most retailers experience as much as 100 
percent annual turnover. Putting employees first has clearly paid 
off for The Container Store and for its employees.28
Questions
1.	 Based on Herzberg’s motivation hygiene theory, how does The 
Container Store reduce job dissatisfaction and increase job 
satisfaction?
2.	 What is The Container Store doing to empower its employ-
ees? How do you think this affects job satisfaction?
3.	 What other steps would you suggest that The Container Store 
take to motivate and satisfy its employees?

1 	SOCIAL MEDIA EXERCISE
Infosys is a successful software company with more than 100,000 
employees. Social media is integral to its strategy and commu-
nications approach. The company uses social media to engage 
younger employees in these processes and to empower them. 
In order to do this, the company created STRAP Surround as a 
social platform containing blogs, discussion forums, an in-house 
version of YouTube for video sharing, and a range of physical 
activities such as games to engage employees. Infosys wanted 
executives to teach, and employees to respond and participate. 
The executives had to then react to this input from the mammoth 
workforce.
	
Here is one example. Employees participated in a series of live 
events related to a strategy execution topic and then tens of thou-
sand of ideas were shared on social media. The company found 
that social media had more effect when fielding ideas that were 
based on structured questions around topics like technologies 
for future growth, digital consumer behavior and healthcare. To 
keep the momentum going, discussion moderators thanked each 
employee who contributed suggestions and then passed them 
onto managers for future development. Some employees were 
chosen to become team members.29
1.	 Do you think social media is an effective way to engage 
employees who are in large organizations? Why or why not?

2.	 Do you think social media would work well in smaller compa-
nies? Why or why not?
3.	 Do you think that using social media changes the corporate 
culture and the way in which teams communicate for the bet-
ter or worse? Explain your answer.
2 	JOURNALING FOR SUCCESS
Discovery statement: Many managers use special techniques to 
foster employee motivation and satisfaction.
Assignment
1.	 Thinking about your current job (or your most recent job), 
what types of motivation techniques are being used?
2.	 How well does each technique work on you and on your co-
workers?
3.	 Thinking about the first job that you will take after completing 
your studies, what types of motivation techniques will be most 
effective in motivating you to truly excel in your new position? 
Explain why.
4.	 Do you expect that most of your co-workers will be motivated 
by the same techniques that motivate you? Explain.
3 	DEVELOPING CRITICAL-THINKING SKILLS
This chapter has described several theories managers can use as 
guidelines in motivating employees to do the best job possible 
for the company. Among these theories are Maslow’s hierarchy of 
needs, equity theory, expectancy theory, and goal-setting theory. 
How effective would each of these theories be in motivating you 
to be a more productive employee?
Assignment
1.	 Identify five job needs that are important to you.
2.	 Determine which of the theories mentioned above would work 
best to satisfy your job needs.
3.	 Prepare a two-page report explaining how you reached these 
conclusions.
4 	BUILDING TEAM SKILLS
By increasing employees’ participation in decision making, 
empowerment makes workers feel more involved in their jobs and 
the operations of the organization. Although empowerment may 
seem like a commonsense idea, it is a concept not found univer-
sally at the workplace. If you had empowerment in your job, how 
would you describe it?
Assignment
1.	 Brainstorm to explore the concept of empowerment.
a.	 Write each letter of the word empowerment in a vertical 
column on a sheet of paper or on the classroom chalk-
board.
b.	 Think of several words that begin with each letter.
c.	 Write the words next to the appropriate letter.
2.	 Formulate a statement by choosing one word from each letter 
that best describes what empowerment means to you.
3.	 Analyze the statement.
a.	 How relevant is the statement for you in terms of empow-
erment? Or empowerment in your workplace?
b.	 What changes must occur in your workplace for you to 
have empowerment?
c.	 How would you describe yourself as an empowered 
employee?
d.	 What opportunities would empowerment give to you in 
your workplace?
4.	 Prepare a report of your findings.
5 	RESEARCHING DIFFERENT CAREERS
Because a manager’s job varies from department to department 
within firms, as well as among firms, it is virtually impossible to 
write a generic description of a manager’s job. If you are con-
templating becoming a manager, you may find it very helpful to 
spend time on the job with several managers learning firsthand 
what they do.
Assignment
1.	 Make an appointment with managers in three firms, prefera-
bly firms of different sizes. When you make the appointments, 
request a tour of the facilities.
2.	 Ask the managers the following questions:
a.	 What do you do in your job?
b.	 What do you like most and least about your job? Why?
c.	 What skills do you need in your job?
d.	 How much education does your job require?
e.	 What advice do you have for someone thinking about pur-
suing a career in management?
3.	 Summarize your findings in a two-page report. Include 
answers to these questions:
a.	 Is management a realistic field of study for you? Why?
b.	 What might be a better career choice? Why?

Inside Business: Saving the National Basketball Association’s Season
No basketball in the fall, or winter, or all season? When the National Basketball Association, 
team owners, and unionized players couldn’t come to agreement after more than a year of 
talks, fans worried that the professional basketball season of 2011-12 would be shortened 
or even canceled.
Money was the major issue, including how to split the income from the sale of tick-
ets, television broadcast rights, and merchandise. The owners wanted half of this income 
to improve the profitability of the league’s many money-losing teams. However, under 
the just-expired contract, the players received 57 percent of basketball-related income. A 
50/50 split would cost the players hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of the 
new multiyear agreement. The players and owners also argued over changes to the league-
wide salary cap and luxury tax, both designed to prevent teams with lots of cash from 
having a huge talent advantage over teams with less cash to spend on athletes’ salaries.
When it became clear that the two sides couldn’t agree, the NBA locked the doors 
to training facilities so players couldn’t report for practice. After weeks of no talks, the 
two sides met several times but made no progress toward resolving their differences. The 
NBA postponed summer training camps and preseason fall games, and then canceled the 
opening weeks of the season. Although a federal mediator was asked to help with negotia-
tions, the two sides still failed to agree. Next, the NBA said it would reduce its offer to the 
players if they didn’t agree quickly. Union members responded by voting to reject the plan 
and dissolve the union. The players also filed an antitrust suit against the NBA, something 
they couldn’t do when represented by the union because of special rules governing labor 
relations in major-league sports.
Finally, on the last Friday in November 2011, the two sides held one more negotiating 
session. Could the players and owners reach an agreement acceptable to both sides, after 
so many months of disagreement, and get players out of the courtroom and back on the 
basketball court?1
T
he National Basketball Association, like a number of other business organiza-
tions, has been unionized for years, and both management and the unions have 
experienced ups and downs. Many businesses today have highly cooperative 
relationships with labor unions. A labor union is an organization of workers act-
ing together to negotiate their wages and working conditions with employers. In the 
United States, nonmanagement employees have the legal right to form unions and to 
bargain, as a group, with management. The result of the bargaining process is a labor 
contract, a written agreement that is in force for a set period of time (usually one to 
three years). The dealings between labor unions and business management, both in the 
bargaining process and beyond it, are called union–management relations or, more 
simply, labor relations.
Because labor and management have different goals, they tend to be at odds with 
each other. However, these goals must be attained by the same means—through the 
production of goods and services. At contract bargaining sessions, the two groups must 
work together to attain their goals. Perhaps mainly for this reason, antagonism now 
seems to be giving way to cooperation in union–management relations.
We open this chapter by reviewing the history of labor unions in this country. Then 
we turn our attention to organized labor today, noting current membership trends and

union–management partnerships and summarizing important labor-relations laws. We 
discuss the unionization process, why employees join unions, how a union is formed, 
and what the National Labor Relations Board does. Then, collective-bargaining pro-
cedures are explained. Next, we consider issues in union–management contracts, 
including employee pay, working hours, security, management rights, and grievance 
procedures. We close with a discussion of various labor and management negotiating 
techniques: strikes, slowdowns and boycotts, lockouts, mediation, and arbitration.
The Historical Development of Unions
Until the middle of the 19th century, there was very little organization of labor in this 
country. Groups of workers occasionally did form a craft union, an organization 
of skilled workers in a single craft or trade. These alliances were 
usually limited to a single city, and they often lasted only a short 
time. In 1786, the first-known strike in the United States involved a 
group of Philadelphia printers who stopped working over demands 
for higher wages. When the employers granted the printers a pay 
increase, the group disbanded.
Early History
In the mid-1800s, improved transportation opened new markets 
for manufactured goods. Improved manufacturing methods made 
it possible to supply those markets, and American industry began 
to grow. The Civil War and the continued growth of the railroads 
after the war led to further industrial expansion.
Large-scale production required more and more skilled indus-
trial workers. As the skilled labor force grew, craft unions emerged 
in the more industrialized areas. From these craft unions, three 
­significant labor organizations evolved. (See Figure 11.1 for a 
­historical overview of unions and their patterns of membership.)
Knights of Labor  The first significant national labor organization 
to emerge was the Knights of Labor, which was formed as a secret 
society in 1869 by Uriah Stephens, a utopian reformer and abolitionist from Philadelphia. 
Membership reached approximately 700,000 by 1886. One major goal of the Knights was 
to eliminate the depersonalization of the worker, which resulted from mass-production 
technology. Another was to improve the moral standards of both employees and society. 
To the detriment of the group, its leaders concentrated so intently on social and economic 
change that they did not recognize the effects of technological change. Moreover, they 
assumed that all employees had the same goals as the Knights’ leaders: social and moral 
reform. The major reason for the demise of the Knights was the Haymarket riot of 1886.
At a rally (called to demand a reduction in the length of a work day from ten to 
eight hours) in Chicago’s Haymarket Square, a bomb exploded. Several police officers 
and civilians were killed or wounded. The Knights were not implicated directly, but 
they quickly lost public favor.
American Federation of Labor  In 1886, several leaders of the Knights of Labor 
joined with independent craft unions to form the American Federation of Labor (AFL). 
Samuel Gompers, one of AFL’s founders, became its first president. Gompers believed 
that the goals of the union should be those of its members rather than those of its 
leaders. The AFL did not seek to change the existing business system, as the Knights 
of Labor had. Instead, its goal was to improve its members’ living standards within 
the system.
Another major difference between the Knights of Labor and the AFL was in their 
positions regarding strikes. A strike is a temporary work stoppage by employees,

calculated to add force to their demands. The Knights did not favor the use of strikes, 
whereas the AFL strongly believed that striking was an effective labor weapon. The 
AFL also believed that organized labor should play a major role in politics. As we will 
see, the AFL is still very much a part of the American labor scene.
Industrial Workers of the World  The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) 
was created in 1905 as a radical alternative to the AFL. Among its goals was the 
overthrow of capitalism. This revolutionary stance prevented the IWW from gaining 
much of a foothold. Perhaps its major accomplishment was to make the AFL seem, by 
comparison, less threatening to the general public and to business leaders.
Evolution of Contemporary Labor Organizations
Between 1900 and 1920, both business and government attempted to keep labor 
unions from growing. This period was plagued by strikes and violent confrontations 
between management and unions. In steelworks, garment factories, and auto plants, 
clashes took place in which striking union members fought bitterly against non-union 
workers, police, and private security guards.
The AFL continued to be the major force in organized labor. By 1920, its mem-
bership included 75 percent of all those who had joined unions. Throughout its exis-
tence, however, the AFL had been unsure of the best way to deal with unskilled and 
semiskilled workers. Most of its members were workers skilled in specific crafts or 
trades. However, technological changes during World War I had brought about a sig-
nificant increase in the number of unskilled and semiskilled employees in the work-
force. These people sought to join the AFL, but they were not well received by its 
established membership.
Some unions within the AFL did recognize the need to organize unskilled and 
semiskilled workers, and they began to penetrate the auto and steel industries. The 
type of union they formed was an industrial union, an organization of both skilled 
and unskilled workers in a single industry. Soon workers in the rubber, mining, news-
paper, and communications industries were also organized into unions. Eventually, 
these unions left the AFL and formed the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).
The total number of members for all unions generally rose between 1869, when the 
first truly national union was organized, and 1980. The dates of major events in 
the history of labor unions are singled out along the line of membership change.

Part 4   Human Resources
During the same time (the late 1930s), there was a major upswing in rank-and-file 
membership in the AFL, the CIO, and independent unions. Strong union leadership, the 
development of effective negotiating tactics, and favorable legislation combined to increase 
total union membership to 9 million in 1940. At that point, the CIO began to rival the 
AFL in size and influence. There was another bitter rivalry: The AFL and CIO often clashed 
over which of them had the right to organize and represent particular groups of employees.
Since World War II, the labor scene has gone through a number of changes. For one 
thing, during and after the war years there was a downturn in public opinion regarding 
unions. A few isolated but very visible strikes during the war caused public sentiment 
to shift against unionism. Perhaps the most significant occurrence, however, was the 
merger of the AFL and the CIO. After years of bickering, the two groups recognized 
that they were wasting effort and resources by fighting each other and that a merger 
would greatly increase the strength of both. The merger took place on December 5, 
1955. The resulting organization, called the AFL–CIO, had a membership of as many 
as 16 million workers, which made it the largest labor organization of its kind in the 
world. Its first president was George Meany, who served until 1979.
Organized Labor Today
The power of unions to negotiate effectively with management is derived from two 
sources. The first is their membership. The more workers a union represents within 
an industry, the greater is its clout in dealing with firms operating 
in that industry. The second source of union power is the group of 
laws that guarantee unions the right to negotiate and, at the same 
time, regulate the negotiating process.
Union Membership
Approximately 11.8 percent of the nation’s workers belong to 
unions.2 Union membership is concentrated in a few industries 
and job categories. Within these industries, though, unions wield 
considerable power.
The AFL–CIO is still the largest union organization in this 
country, boasting approximately 12 million members.3 Those 
­represented by the AFL–CIO include actors, barbers, ­construction 
workers, carpenters, retail clerks, musicians, teachers, postal 
­workers, painters, steel and iron workers, firefighters, bricklayers, 
and newspaper reporters.
One of the largest unions not associated directly with the AFL–
CIO is the Teamsters Union. The Teamsters originally were part 
of the AFL–CIO, but in 1957 they were expelled for corrupt and 
illegal practices. The union started out as an organization of pro-
fessional drivers, but it has begun recently to recruit employees in 
a wide variety of jobs. Current membership is about 1.4 million 
workers.4
The United Steelworkers (USW) and the United Auto Workers 
(UAW) are two of the largest industrial unions. The USW member-
ship has risen to over 1 million workers. It is known as the domi-
nant union in paper and forestry products, steel, aluminum, tire 
and rubber, mining, glass, chemicals, petroleum, and other basic 
resource industries. The UAW represents employees in the automo-
bile industry. The UAW, too, originally was part of the AFL–CIO, 
but it left the parent union—of its own accord—in 1968. Currently, 
the UAW has about 376,000 members.5 The UAW rejoined the 
AFL–CIO in 1981.

Want to join a union? There are several general 
reasons why workers join unions. Clearly, there are 
additional reasons for joining a union related to 
the characteristics of a specific company, industry 
practices, and a worker's individual needs.

The proportion of union members relative to the size of the nation’s workforce has 
declined over the last 30 years. Moreover, total union membership has dropped since 
1980 despite steadily increasing membership in earlier years (see Figure 11.1).
To a great extent, this decline in membership is caused by several factors. Heavily 
unionized industries either have been decreasing in size or have not been growing 
as fast as non-unionized industries. For example, cutbacks in the steel industry have 
tended to reduce union membership. At the same time, the growth of high-tech indus-
tries has increased the ranks of non-union workers. Many firms have moved from the 
heavily unionized Northeast and Great Lakes regions to the less-unionized southeast 
and southwest regions—the so-called Sunbelt. At the relocated plants, formerly union-
ized firms tend to hire non-union workers. The largest growth in employment is occur-
ring in the service industries, and these industries typically are not unionized. Some 
U.S. companies have moved their manufacturing operations to other countries where 
less-unionized labor is employed.
A recent study on union participation rates found a negative correlation between 
union participation and wage inequality. Decades ago, when unions were strong 
Social
Media
Union Tweeting
Labor unions are increasingly using social media to 
promote their causes. A growing number of union 
organizations and members are already represented 
on Facebook and other social networking sites. It is also 
common for workers to set up community sites and blogs 
where they can openly discuss their concerns without 
having to worry about doing so on the job. Organizing 
2.0 is an organization that is dedicated to helping labor 
organizers use social media more effectively. They also 
encourage users to join them on Twitter. Organizing 
2.0 utilizes social media to connect people from many 
types of organizations, including labor, progressives, 
nonprofits, tech firms, faith communities, and information 
technologists.

and roughly 1 in 3 men were union members, they were able to exert a power-
ful influence over maintaining high wages. The study found that the largest factor 
contributing to union decline has been the growth of jobs outside of traditionally 
unionized industries, such as manufacturing and construction. The study also found 
that, even in unionized industries, managers have increasingly grown opposed to 
union activity.6
Union–Management Partnerships
For most of the 20th century, unions represented workers with respect to wages and 
working conditions. To obtain rights for workers and recognition for themselves, unions 
engaged in often-antagonistic collective-bargaining sessions and strikes. At the same 
time, management traditionally protected its own rights of decision making, workplace 
organization, and strategic planning. Increasingly, however, management has become 
aware that this traditionally adversarial relationship does not result in the kind of high-
performance workplace and empowered workforce necessary to succeed in today’s 
highly competitive markets. For their part, unions and their members acknowledge that 
most major strikes result in failures that cost members thousands of jobs and reduce 
the unions’ credibility. Today, instead of maintaining an “us versus them” mentality, 
many unions are becoming partners with management and cooperating to enhance the 
workplace, empower workers, increase production, improve quality, and reduce costs. 
According to the Department of Labor, the number of union–management partnerships 
in the United States is increasing.
Union–management partnerships can be initiated by union leaders, employees, 
or management. Long-range strategic partnerships focus on sharing decision-making 
power for a whole range of workplace and business issues. Long-range partnerships 
sometimes begin as limited ones and develop slowly over time. Limited partnerships 
center on accomplishing one specific task or project, such as the introduction of teams 
or the design of training programs. Education remains an industry that has relatively 
high union participation rates. Yale University, for instance, has a long-range strategic 
partnership with employees who belong to the Unite Here Locals 34 and 35 labor 
unions. This arrangement helps the two parties to develop best practices, as well as 
provides a forum to solve disputes and agree on contracts.7
Although strategic union–management partnerships vary, 
most of them have several characteristics in common. First, stra-
tegic partnerships focus on developing cooperative relationships 
between unions and management instead of arguing over contrac-
tual rights. Second, partners work toward mutual gain, in which 
the organization becomes more competitive, employees are better 
off, and unions are stronger as a result of the partnership. Finally, 
as already noted, strategic partners engage in joint decision mak-
ing on a broad array of issues. These issues include performance 
expectations, organizational structure, strategic alliances, new 
technology, pay and benefits, employee security and involvement, 
union–management roles, product development, and education 
and training.
Good labor–management relations can help everyone to deal 
with new and ­difficult labor issues as they develop. For example, 
many companies hope that their union–management partnerships 
will be strong enough to deal with the critical issue of rising health 
care costs. Unions work hard to protect their members from hav-
ing to pay an increased percentage of health care costs, and they 
have experienced some success, in that an average union worker 
pays about 17 percent of his or her health care premiums com-
pared with a non-union worker’s contribution of about 33 per-
cent.8 Strong union–management partnerships will play a vital role 
in resolving health care issues.

From conflict to cooperation. A union leader and 
a top executive at Chrysler group LLC are leading their 
organization toward a partnership that will expand 
Chrysler’s operations and the number of workers it 
needs. Traditionally, labor-management relations have 
been contentious.  However, over the years, many firm 
and unions have learned that cooperation is the key to 
the success of both groups.

Union–management partnerships have many potential benefits for management, 
workers, and unions. For management, partnerships can result in lower costs, increased 
revenue, improved product quality, and greater customer satisfaction. For workers, 
­benefits may include increased response to their needs, more decision-making opportu-
nities, less supervision, more responsibility, and increased job security. Unions can gain 
credibility, strength, and increased membership.
Among the many organizations that have found union-management partnerships 
beneficial is the Ford Motor Company. It has currently signed a union-management 
partnership agreement with the UAW. This partnership was created to increase the 
number of jobs and to make Ford more completive. The partnership will result in a 
better communications network throughout the company’s management system as well 
as improvement in quality performance.9 
Labor–Management Legislation
As we have noted, business opposed early efforts to organize labor. The federal 
government generally supported anti-union efforts through the court system, and in 
some cases federal troops were used to end strikes. Gradually, however, the government 
began to correct this imbalance through the legislative process.
Norris–LaGuardia Act
The first major piece of legislation to secure rights for unions, the Norris–LaGuardia 
Act of 1932, was considered a landmark in labor–management relations. This act 
made it difficult for businesses to obtain court orders that banned strikes, picketing, or 
union membership drives. Previously, courts had issued such orders readily as a means 
of curbing these activities.
National Labor Relations Act
The National Labor Relations Act, also known as the Wagner Act, was passed by 
Congress in 1935. It established procedures by which employees decide whether they 
want to be represented by a union. If workers choose to be represented, the Wagner 
Act requires management to negotiate with union representatives. Before this law was 
passed, union efforts sometimes were interpreted as violating the Sherman Act (1890) 
because they were viewed as attempts to monopolize. The Wagner Act also forbid 
certain unfair labor practices on the part of management, such as firing or punishing 
workers because they were pro-union, spying on union meetings, and bribing employees 
to vote against unionization.
Finally, the Wagner Act established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) 
to enforce the provisions of the law. The NLRB is concerned primarily with (1) over-
seeing the elections in which employees decide whether they will be represented by a 
union and (2) investigating complaints lodged by unions or employees. Recently, the 
NLRB passed a ruling that most U.S. employers must post a notice informing employ-
ees of their right to join a union and bargain collectively. The decision has proved 
divisive, spurring more than 7,000 comments when it was first posted online. Pro-labor 
groups applaud it for keeping workers informed of their rights, while some managers 
and lawyers complain that the NLRB has become too pro-union.10
Fair Labor Standards Act
In 1938, Congress enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act. One major provision of this act 
permits the federal government to set a minimum wage. The first minimum wage, which 
was set in the late 1930s and did not include farm workers and retail employees, was $0.25 
an hour. Today, the national minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, although many states and 
cities set their own minimum wages to account for differences in costs of living. Washington 
state has the highest minimum wage in the nation at $9.04 an hour.11 Some employees, such 
as wait persons and farm workers, are still exempt from the minimum-wage provisions in

most states. The act also requires that employees be paid overtime rates for work in excess 
of 40 hours a week. Finally, it prohibits the use of child labor.
Labor–Management Relations Act
The legislation of the 1930s sought to discourage unfair practices on the part of 
employers. Recall from Figure 11.1 that union membership grew from approximately 
2 million in 1910 to almost 12 million by 1945. Unions represented over 35 percent 
of all nonagricultural employees in 1945. As union membership and power grew, 
however, the federal government began to examine the practices of labor. Several long 
and bitter strikes in the 1940s, mainly in the coal mining and trucking industries, led to 
a demand for legislative restraint on unions. As a result, in 1947 Congress passed the 
Labor–Management Relations Act, also known as the Taft–Hartley Act, over President 
Harry Truman’s veto.
The Taft–Hartley Act’s objective is to provide a balance between union power and 
management authority. It lists unfair labor practices that unions are forbidden to use. 
These include refusal to bargain with management in good faith, charging excessive 
membership dues, harassing non-union workers, and using various means of coercion 
against employers.
The Taft–Hartley Act also gives management more rights during union organizing 
campaigns. For example, management may outline for employees the advantages and 
disadvantages of union membership, as long as the information it presents is accu-
rate. The act gives the President of the United States the power to obtain a temporary 
injunction to prevent or stop a strike that endangers national health and safety. An 
injunction is a court order requiring a person or group either to perform some act or 
to refrain from performing some act. Finally, the Taft–Hartley Act authorized states to 
enact laws to allow employees to work in a unionized firm without joining the union. 
Currently, 22 states (many in the south) have passed such right-to-work laws.12

who favor such restrictions are looking to improve the future

Public-sector employees oppose limitations on their 
collective bargaining rights. They see limitations as one step 
toward preventing unions from representing their interests in 
negotiations over working conditions and other issues, not just 
pay. Many also feel that public-sector unions are being unfairly 
blamed for states’ budget problems. So should the collective-
bargaining rights of public-sector unions be curtailed?

Success or Failure?
Government employees in many states 
have long been represented by unions 
empowered to bargain on their behalf. In 
recent years, however, officials in some cash-
strapped states have sought to curtail or eliminate collective 
bargaining rights for public-sector unions. Wisconsin, for 
example, passed a law that limits unions representing public 
employees to bargaining for wages only. This led to a recall 
effort aimed at unseating the governor who spearheaded 
the law. The Ohio legislature also voted to limit collective 
bargaining by public-sector unions—although that law was 
repealed the following year.

payoffs from employers for union protection. Some were involved in arson, blackmail, 
and murder. Public pressure for reform resulted in the 1959 Landrum–Griffin Act.
This law was designed to regulate the internal functioning of labor unions. 
Provisions of the law require unions to file annual reports with the U.S. Department of 
Labor regarding their finances, elections, and various decisions made by union officers. 
The Landrum–Griffin Act also ensures that each union member has the right to seek, 
nominate, and vote for each elected position in his or her union. It provides safeguards 
governing union funds, and it requires management and unions to report the lending 
of management funds to union officers, union members, or local unions.
The various pieces of legislation we have reviewed here effectively regulate much 
of the relationship between labor and management after a union has been established. 
The next section demonstrates that forming a union is also a carefully regulated process.
The Unionization Process
Before a union can be formed at a particular firm, some employees of the firm must be 
interested in being represented by a union. Then, they must take a number of steps to 
formally declare their desire for a union. To ensure fairness, most of the steps in this 
unionization process are supervised by the NLRB.
Why Some Employees Join Unions
Obviously, employees start or join a union for a variety of reasons.
In many industries, such as teaching, union membership is so prevalent that new 
employees may feel compelled to join. In some states, even those employees who 
choose not to join a union are required to pay union dues, which is a serious incentive 
to join. Another commonly cited reason for joining a union is to combat a feeling of 
alienation.13 Some employees—especially those whose jobs are dull and repetitive—
may perceive themselves as merely parts of a machine. They may feel that they lose 
their individual or social identity at work. Union membership is one way to establish 
contact with others in a firm.
Another common reason for joining a union is the perception that union mem-
bership increases job security. No one wants to live in fear of arbitrary or capricious 
dismissal from a job. Unions actually have only limited ability to guarantee a member’s 
job, but they can help to increase job security by enforcing seniority rules.
Employees may also join a union because of dissatisfaction with one or more ele-
ments of their jobs. If they are unhappy with their pay, benefits, or working conditions, 
they may look to a union to correct the perceived deficiencies.
Some people join unions because of their personal backgrounds. For example, a 
person whose parents are strong believers in unions might be inclined to feel just as 
positive about union membership.
In some situations, employees must join a union to keep their jobs. Many unions 
try, through their labor contracts, to require that a firm’s new employees join the union 
after a specified probationary period. Under the Taft–Hartley Act, states may pass 
right-to-work laws prohibiting this practice.
Steps in Forming a Union
The first step in forming a union is the organizing campaign (see Figure 11.2). Its 
primary objective is to develop widespread employee interest in having a union. To 
kick off the campaign, a national union may send organizers to the firm to stir this 
interest. Alternatively, the employees themselves may decide that they want a union. 
Then they contact the appropriate national union and ask for organizing assistance.
The organizing campaign can be quite emotional, and it may lead to conflict 
between employees and management. On the one hand, the employees who want 
the union will be dedicated to its creation. On the other hand, management will be 
extremely sensitive to what it sees as a potential threat to its power and control.

Part 4   Human Resources
At some point during the organizing campaign, employees are asked to sign autho-
rization cards (see Figure 11.3) to indicate—in writing—their support for the union. 
Because of various NLRB rules and regulations, both union organizers and company 
management must be very careful in their behavior during this authorization drive. 
For example, employees cannot be asked to sign the cards when they are supposed 
to be working. Management may not indicate in any way that employees’ jobs or job 
security will be in jeopardy if they do sign the cards.
If at least 30 percent of the eligible employees sign authorization cards, the orga-
nizers generally request that the firm recognize the union as the employees’ bargaining 
representative. Usually the firm rejects this request, and a formal election is held to 
decide whether to have a union. This election usually involves secret ballots and is con-
ducted by the NLRB. The outcome of the election is determined by a simple majority 
of eligible employees who choose to vote.
If the union obtains a majority, it becomes the official bargaining agent for its 
members, and the final step, NLRB certification, takes place. The union may immedi-
ately begin the process of negotiating a labor contract with management. If the union 
is voted down, the NLRB will not allow another election for one year.
Several factors can complicate the unionization process. For example, the ­bargaining 
unit, which is the specific group of employees that the union is to represent, must be 
defined. Union organizers may want to represent all hourly employees at a particular 
site (such as all workers at a manufacturing plant), or they may wish to represent only 
a specific group of employees (such as all electricians in a large manufacturing plant).
Unions must have written authorization to represent employees.

Another issue that may have to be resolved is that of 
­jurisdiction, which is the right of a particular union to organize 
particular groups of workers (such as nurses). When jurisdictions 
overlap or are unclear, the employees themselves may decide who 
will represent them. In some cases, two or more unions may be 
trying to organize some or all of the employees of a firm. Then, 
the election choices may be union A, union B, or no union at all.
The Role of the NLRB
As we have demonstrated, the NLRB is heavily involved in the 
unionization process. Generally, the NLRB is responsible for 
overseeing the organizing campaign, conducting the election (if 
one is warranted), and certifying the election results.
During the organizing campaign, both employers and union 
organizers can take steps to educate employees regarding the 
advantages and disadvantages of having a union. However, ­neither 
is allowed to use underhanded tactics or to distort the truth. If 
violations occur, the NLRB can stop the questionable behavior, 
postpone the election, or set aside the results of an election that 
has already taken place.
The NLRB usually conducts the election within 45 days of 
receiving the required number of signed authorization cards from 
the organizers. A very high percentage of the eligible voters gen-
erally participate in the election, and it is held at the workplace 
during normal working hours. In certain cases, however, a mail ballot or some other 
form of election may be called for.
Certification of the election involves counting the votes and considering challenges to 
the election. After the election results are announced, management and the union organizers 
have five days to challenge the election. The basis for a challenge might be improper conduct 
before the election or participation by an ineligible voter. After considering any challenges, 
the NLRB passes final judgment on the election results.
When union representation is established, union and management get down to the serious 
business of contract negotiations.
Collective Bargaining
Once certified by the NLRB, a new union’s first task is to establish its own identity and 
structure. It immediately signs up as many members as possible. Then, in an internal 
election, members choose officers and representatives. A negotiating committee is also 
chosen to begin collective bargaining, the process of negotiating a labor contract with 
management.
The First Contract
To prepare for its first contract session with management, the negotiating committee decides 
on its position on the various contract issues and determines the issues that are most 
important to the union’s members. For example, the two most pressing concerns might be 
a general wage increase and an improved benefits package.
The union then informs management that it is ready to begin negotiations, and the 
two parties agree on a time and location. Both sides continue to prepare for the session 
up to the actual date of the negotiations.
Negotiations are occasionally held on company premises, but it is more common 
for the parties to meet away from the workplace—perhaps in a local hotel. The union 
typically is represented by the negotiating committee and one or more officials from 
the regional or national union office. The firm normally is represented by ­managers 
from the industrial-relations, operations, human resources management, and legal

Unions are facing new challenges. Compensation 
and employee benefits are often the major issues a 
company and union leaders discuss during contract 
negotiations. Other issues include the working 
conditions and hours employees face and their right 
to organize and bargain with their employers in the 
first place. For example, to save money, the state of 
Wisconsin recently stripped away the bargaining rights 
of state government workers, who are union members.

departments. Each side is required by law to negotiate 
in good faith and not to stall or attempt to extend the 
bargaining proceedings unnecessarily.
The union normally presents its contract demands 
first. Management then responds to the demands, often 
with a counterproposal. The bargaining may move 
back and forth, from proposal to counterproposal, 
over a number of meetings. Throughout the process, 
union representatives constantly keep their members 
informed of what is going on and how the negotiating com-
mittee feels about the various proposals and counterproposals.
Each side clearly tries to “get its own way” as much as 
possible, but each also recognizes the need for compromise. For 
example, the union may begin the negotiations by demanding 
a wage increase of $1 per hour but may be willing to accept 
60 cents per hour. Management initially may offer 40 cents but 
may be willing to pay 75 cents. Eventually, the two sides will 
agree on a wage increase of between 60 and 75 cents per hour.
If an agreement cannot be reached, the union may strike. 
However, strikes are rare during a union’s first contract nego-
tiations. In most cases, the negotiating teams are able to agree 
on an initial contract without recourse to a strike.
The final step in collective bargaining is ratification, which 
is approval of the contract by a vote of the union membership. 
If the membership accepts the terms of the contract, it is signed 
and becomes a legally binding agreement. If the contract is not ratified, the negotiators 
must go back and try to iron out a more acceptable agreement.
Later Contracts
A labor contract may cover a period of one to three years or more, but every contract 
has an expiration date. As that date approaches, both management and the union begin 
to prepare for new contract negotiations. Now, however, the entire process is likely to 
be much thornier than the first negotiation.
For one thing, the union and the firm have “lived with each other” for several years, 
during which some difficulties may have emerged. Each side may see certain issues as being 
of critical importance—issues that provoke a great deal of emotion at the bargaining table 
and often are difficult to resolve. Also, each side has learned from the earlier negotiations. 
Each may take a harder line on certain issues and be less willing to compromise.
The contract deadline itself also produces tension. As the expiration date of the 
existing contract draws near, each side feels a pressure—real or imagined—to reach an 
agreement. This pressure may nudge the negotiators toward an agreement, but it also 
can have the opposite effect, making an accord more difficult to reach. Moreover, at 
some point during the negotiations, union leaders are likely to take a strike vote. This 
vote reveals whether union members are willing to strike in the event that a new con-
tract is not negotiated before the old one expires. In almost all cases, this vote supports 
a strike. Thus, the threat of a strike may add to the pressure mounting on both sides 
as they go about the business of negotiating.
Union–Management Contract Issues
As you might expect, many diverse issues are negotiated by unions and management 
and are incorporated into a labor contract. Unions tend to emphasize issues related to 
members’ income, their standard of living, and the strength of the union. Management’s 
primary goals are to retain as much control as possible over the firm’s operations and 
to maximize its strength relative to that of the union. The balance of power between 
union and management varies from firm to firm.

315
Employee Pay
An area of bargaining central to union–management relations is employee pay. Three 
separate issues are usually involved: the forms of pay, the magnitude of pay, and the 
means by which the magnitude of pay will be determined.
Forms of Pay  The primary form of pay is direct compensation—the wage or salary 
and benefits an employee receives in exchange for his or her contribution to the organi-
zation. Because direct compensation is a fairly straightforward issue, negotiators often 
spend much more of their time developing a benefits package for employees. Because 
the range of benefits and their costs have escalated over the years, this element of pay 
has become increasingly important and complex.
We discussed various employee benefits in Chapter 9. Of these, health, life, dis-
ability, and dental insurance are important benefits that unions try to obtain for their 
members. As the costs of health care continue to increase, insurance benefits are costing 
employers more, and many are trying to pass a higher portion of this increased cost 
on to their employees. Deferred compensation, in the form of pension or retirement 
programs, is also a common focal point. Decisions about deferred compensation can 
have a long-lasting impact on a company.
Other benefits commonly dealt with in the bargaining process include paid vacation 
time, holidays, and a policy on paid sick leave. Obviously, unions argue for as much paid 
vacation and holiday time as possible and for liberal sick-leave policies. Management 
naturally takes the opposite position. After decades of generous benefits packages, most 
firms have been forced to cut back due to decreased revenues or increased expenses. 
Especially as more baby boomers retire, pensions have become too expensive to be 
sustainable. Even heavily unionized industries, such as automobile manufacturing and 
utilities, have had to reduce their pensions and benefits for younger workers.14
Magnitude of Pay  Of considerable importance is the magnitude, or amount, of pay 
that employees receive as both direct and indirect compensation. The union attempts 
to ensure that pay is on par with that received by other employees in the same or 
similar industries, both locally and nationally. The union also attempts to include in 
the contract clauses that provide pay increases over the life of the agreement. The most 
Arbitration Down Under
unions come to agreement. When the deadline passed without 
a resolution, the tribunal ruled that the disputes would be 
settled by binding arbitration. During the next few months, 
while the airline and its engineers worked out an agreement that 
the tribunal approved, negotiations with ground crew and long-
haul pilots continued toward arbitration. Neither the unions 
nor the airline knew what the tribunal would decide about pay 
and security.

SUCCESS
On every continent, airlines are feeling 
squeezed by gyrating fuel prices and global 
competition. So when Australia’s Qantas 
Airways wanted to restructure to get ready 
for expansion, unions representing its engineers, pilots, and 
ground staff worried about job security and pay. Airline 
management and union representatives negotiated for months 
to resolve their differences, without success. After a series 
of strikes by unionized ground crew, Qantas took the very 
unusual step of halting all flights, domestic and international, 
for nearly two days.
 Then the country’s labor relations tribunal, Fair Work 
Australia, intervened to prevent further strikes and get Qantas 
flying again. It allowed three weeks for the airline and its

common is the cost-of-living clause, which ties periodic pay increases to increases in 
the cost of living, as defined by various economic statistics or indicators.
Of course, the magnitude of pay is also affected by the organization’s ability to pay. 
If the firm has posted large profits recently, the union may expect large pay increases 
for its members. If the firm has not been very profitable, the union may agree to smaller 
pay hikes or even to a pay freeze. In an extreme situation (e.g., when the firm is border-
ing on bankruptcy), the union may agree to pay cuts. Very stringent conditions usually 
are included in any agreement to a pay cut.
Bargaining with regard to magnitude also revolves around employee benefits. At 
one extreme, unions seek a wide range of benefits, entirely or largely paid for by the 
firm. At the other extreme, management may be willing to offer the benefits package 
but may want its employees to bear most of the cost. Again, factors such as equity 
(with similar firms and jobs) and ability to pay enter into the final agreement.
Pay Determinants  Negotiators also address the question of how individual pay 
will be determined. For management, the ideal arrangement is to tie wages to each 
employee’s productivity. As we have seen, this method of payment tends to motivate 
and reward effort. Unions, on the other hand, feel that this arrangement can cre-
ate unnecessary competition among employees. They generally argue that employees 
should be paid—at least in part—according to seniority. Seniority is the length of time 
an employee has worked for an organization.
Determinants regarding benefits are also negotiated. For example, management 
may want to provide profit-sharing benefits only to employees who have worked for the 
firm for a specified number of years. The union may want these benefits provided to all 
employees. Members of the Chicago police union receive large portions of their pay in 
the form of perks and benefits. For example, the union has an incredibly generous sick 
leave package. Police officers are allowed to take off up to 365 days of sick leave every 
two years. They also receive an annual allowance of $1,800 to compensate them for 
uniform costs and $2,800 in compensation for on-call time. Mayor Rahm Emanuel has 
been searching for ways to reduce the generous and expensive police benefits package.15
Working Hours
The number of working hours is another important issue in contract negotiations. The 
matter of overtime is of special interest. Federal law defines overtime as time worked 
in excess of 40 hours in one week. It also specifies that overtime pay must be at least 
one-and-one-half times the normal hourly wage. Unions may also attempt to negotiate 
overtime rates for all hours worked beyond eight hours in a single day. Similarly, the 
union may attempt to obtain higher overtime rates (say, twice the normal hourly wage) 
for weekend or holiday work. Still another issue is an upper limit to overtime, beyond 
which employees can refuse to work.
In firms with two or more work shifts, workers on less desirable shifts are paid 
a premium for their time. Both the amount of the premium and the manner in which 
workers are chosen for (or choose) particular shifts are negotiable issues. Other issues 
related to working hours are the work starting times and the length of lunch periods 
and coffee breaks.
Security
Security actually covers two issues. One is the job security of the individual worker; 
the other is the security of the union as the bargaining representative of the firm’s 
employees.
Job security is protection against the loss of employment. It is a major concern of 
individuals. As we noted earlier, the desire for increased job security is a major reason 
for joining unions in the first place. In the typical labor contract, job security is based 
on seniority. If employees must be laid off or dismissed, those with the least seniority 
are the first to go. Some of the more senior employees may have to move to lower-level 
jobs, but they remain employed.

Union security is protection of the union’s position as the employees’ bargaining 
agent. Union security is frequently a more volatile issue than job security. Unions strive 
for as much security as possible, but management tends to see an increase in union 
security as an erosion of its control.
Union security arises directly from its membership. The greater the ratio of union 
employees to non-union employees, the more secure the union is. In contract negotia-
tions, unions thus attempt to establish various union membership conditions. The most 
restrictive of these is the closed shop, in which workers must join the union before 
they are hired. This condition was outlawed by the Taft–Hartley Act, but several other 
arrangements, including the following, are subject to negotiation:
●
●The union shop, in which new employees must join the union after a specified 
probationary period
●
●The agency shop, in which employees can choose not to join the union but must 
pay dues to the union anyway (The idea is that non-union employees benefit from 
union activities and should help to support them.)
●
●The maintenance shop, in which an employee who joins the union must remain 
a union member as long as he or she is employed by the firm
Management Rights
Of particular interest to the firm are those rights and privileges that are to be retained 
by management. For example, the firm wants as much control as possible over whom 
it hires, how work is scheduled, and how discipline is handled. The union, in contrast, 
would like some control over these and other matters affecting its members. It is 
interesting that some unions are making progress toward their goal of playing a more 
direct role in corporate governance. Some union executives have, in fact, been given seats 
on corporate boards of directors. In the wake of negative publicity related to an allegedly 
toxic corporate culture, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein agreed to a union deal 
with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), 
which represents 1.6 million members. The deal creates more independent oversight of 
the firm and its board, but allows CEO Blankfein to retain much of his previous power.16
Grievance Procedures
A grievance procedure is a formally established course of action for resolving 
employee complaints against management. Virtually every labor contract contains a 
grievance procedure. Procedures vary in scope and detail, but they may involve the four 
steps described as follows (see Figure 11.4).
Original Grievance  The process begins with an employee who believes that he 
or she has been treated unfairly in violation of the labor contract. For example, an 
employee may be entitled to a formal performance review after six months on the 
job. If no such review is conducted, the employee may file a grievance. To do so, the 
employee explains the grievance to a shop steward, an employee elected by union 
members to serve as their representative. The employee and the steward then discuss 
the grievance with the employee’s immediate supervisor. Both the grievance and the 
supervisor’s response are put in writing.
Broader Discussion  In most cases, the problem is resolved during the initial discus-
sion with the supervisor. If it is not, a second discussion is held. Now the participants 
include the original parties (employee, supervisor, and steward), a representative from 
the union’s grievance committee, and the firm’s industrial-relations representative. 
Again, a record is kept of the discussion and its results.
Full-Scale Discussion  If the grievance is still not resolved, a full-scale discussion is 
arranged. This discussion includes everyone involved in the broader discussion, as well 
as all remaining members of the union’s grievance committee and another high-level 
union security  protection of the 
union’s position as the employees’ 
bargaining agent
closed shop  a workplace in 
which workers must join the union 
before they are hired; outlawed by 
the ­Taft–Hartley Act
union shop  a workplace in 
which new employees must 
join the union after a specified 
probationary period
agency shop  a workplace in 
which employees can choose not 
to join the union but must pay 
dues to the union anyway
maintenance shop  a workplace 
in which an employee who joins 
the union must remain a union 
member as long as he or she is 
employed by the firm

manager. As usual, all proceedings are put in writing. All participants are careful not to 
violate the labor contract during this attempt to resolve the complaint.
Arbitration  The final step in a grievance procedure is arbitration, in which a neutral 
third party hears the two sides of a dispute and renders a binding decision. As in a 
court hearing, each side presents its case and has the right to cross-examine witnesses. 
In addition, the arbitrator reviews the written documentation of all previous steps in 
the grievance procedure. Both sides may then give summary arguments and/or present 
briefs. The arbitrator then decides whether a provision of the labor contract has been 
violated and proposes a remedy. The arbitrator cannot make any decision that would 
add to, detract from, or modify the terms of the contract. If it can be proved that the 
arbitrator exceeded the scope of his or her authority, either party may appeal the deci-
sion to the courts.
What actually happens when union and management “lock horns” over all the 
issues we have mentioned? We can answer this question by looking now at the negoti-
ating tools each side can wield.
Union and Management  
Negotiating Tools
Management and unions can draw on certain tools to influence each other during 
contract negotiations. Both sides may use advertising and publicity to gain support for 
their respective positions. The most extreme tools are strikes and lockouts, but there 
are other, milder techniques as well.
Strikes
Unions only go out on strike in a very few instances. These almost always occur 
after an existing labor contract has expired. Generally speaking, strikes have been 
on the decline. There were only five major strikes in 2009, which was the lowest

Explain the primary 
bargaining tools available to 
unions and management.
The employee grievance procedure for most organizations consists of four steps. Each ensuing step  
involves all the personnel from the preceding step plus at least one higher-level person. The final step  
is to go to a neutral third party, the arbitrator.

documented annual number since the U.S. government started tracking in 
1947. The following year, 2010, had only 11 major strikes. There were 19 
major strikes and lockouts in 2011, which represented a significant increase 
over the previous year.17 Even then, if new contract negotiations seem to be 
proceeding smoothly, a union does not actually start a strike. The union does 
take a strike vote, but the vote may be used primarily to show members’ 
commitment to a strike if negotiations fail.
The main objective of a strike is to put financial pressure on the company 
to encourage management to meet union demands. When union members 
do go out on strike, it is usually because negotiations seem to be stalled. A 
strike is simply a work stoppage: The employees do not report for work. In 
­addition, striking workers engage in picketing, marching back and forth 
in front of a place of employment with signs informing the public that a 
strike is in progress. In doing so, they hope that (1) the public will be sym-
pathetic to the strikers and will not patronize the struck firm, (2) nonstrik-
ing ­employees of the firm will honor the picket line and not report to work, 
and (3) ­members of other unions will not cross the picket line (e.g., to make 
deliveries) and thus will further restrict the operations of the struck firm. 
Unions may also engage in informational picketing to let companies know 
of their dissatisfaction.
In March 2012, union members of Allied Waste and Republic ­picketed 
in cities around Washington, Alabama, New York, and Ohio over complaints 
regarding changes to their health care coverage. The picketing and waste 
service stoppages affected over 60,000 customers.18
Obviously, strikes are expensive to both the firm and the strikers. The 
firm loses business and earnings during the strike, and the striking workers 
lose the wages they would have earned if they had been at their jobs. During 
a strike, unions try to provide their members with as much support as pos-
sible. Larger unions are able to put a portion of their members’ dues into a 
strike fund. The fund is used to provide financial support for striking union 
members. At times, workers may go out on a wildcat strike, which is a strike 
that has not been approved by the union. In this situation, union leaders 
typically work with management to convince the strikers to return to work.
Slowdowns and Boycotts
Almost every labor contract contains a clause that prohibits strikes during 
the life of the contract. (This is why strikes, if they occur, usually take 
place after a contract has expired.) However, a union may strike a firm 
while the contract is in force if members believe that management has 
violated its terms. Workers also may engage in a slowdown, a technique 
whereby workers report to their jobs but work at a pace that is slower 
than normal.
A boycott is a refusal to do business with a particular firm. Unions occa-
sionally bring this strategy to bear by urging members (and sympathizers) 
not to purchase the products of a firm with which they are having a dispute. 
The Major League Baseball players’ union released a statement condemning 
the Arizona state law that gives police unprecedented powers to determine 
anyone’s immigration status. In addition to expressing their disapproval of 
the law, many big-league players vowed they would not attend the All-Star 
Game, which was held in Arizona, but everything went according to plan, 
despite the dispute over the law.19 A primary boycott, aimed at the employer 
directly involved in the dispute, can be a powerful weapon. A secondary boy-
cott, aimed at a firm doing business with the employer, is prohibited by the 
Taft–Hartley Act. Cesar Chavez, a migrant worker who founded the United 
Farm Workers Union, used boycotts to draw attention to the low pay and 
awful conditions endured by produce pickers.
To strike or not to strike? A strike can 
increase the public’s support for a union 
and hamper a firm’s ability to operate 
effectively.  But strikes are risky. They can 
cost their members a lot of money and 
even their jobs. The public isn’t always 
sympathetic to strikers either—especially 
during period of high unemployment when 
it’s hard for people to find even low-paying 
jobs with few or no benefits

Part 4   Human Resources
Lockouts and Strikebreakers
Management’s most potent weapon is the lockout. In 
a lockout, the firm refuses to allow employees to enter 
the workplace. Like strikes, lockouts are expensive 
for both the firm and its employees. For this reason, 
they are only used rarely and in certain circumstances. 
A firm that produces perishable goods, for example, 
may use a lockout if management believes that its 
employees will soon go on strike. The idea is to stop 
production in time to ensure minimal spoilage of finished 
goods or work-in-process.
Management also may attempt to hire strikebreakers. A 
strikebreaker is a non-union employee who performs the job 
of a striking union member. Hiring strikebreakers can result 
in violence when picketing employees confront the non-union 
workers at the entrance to the struck facility. The firm also 
faces the problem of finding qualified replacements for the 
striking workers. Sometimes management personnel take over 
the jobs of strikers. Managers at telephone companies have 
had to get actively involved in phone repair services.
Mediation and Arbitration
Strikes, strikebreaking, lockouts, and boycotts all pit one side 
against the other. Ultimately, one side “wins” and the other 
“loses.” Unfortunately, the negative effects of such actions—
including resentment, fear, and distrust—may linger for months 
or years after a dispute has been resolved.
More productive techniques that are being used increas-
ingly are mediation and arbitration. Either one may come 
into play before a labor contract expires or after some other strategy, such as a 
strike, has proved ineffective.
Mediation is the use of a neutral third party to assist management and the union 
during their negotiations. This third party (the mediator) listens to both sides, trying 
to find common ground for agreement. The mediator also tries to facilitate com-
munication between the two sides, to promote compromise, and generally to keep 
the negotiations moving. At first the mediator may meet privately with each side. 
Eventually, however, his or her goal is to get the two to settle their differences. The 
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) is an independent government 
agency that handles mediation for labor disputes. The agency handles 4,700 collec-
tive-bargaining negotiations per year, with 75 percent of those mediations reaching an 
agreement from both parties. The agency reports to have saved businesses and work-
ers approximately $20 billion during 1999–2011, showing the benefits of mediation 
for both parties.20
Unlike mediation, the arbitration step is a formal hearing. Just as it may be 
the final step in a grievance procedure, it also may be used in contract negotia-
tions (perhaps after mediation attempts) when the two sides cannot agree on one 
or more issues. Here, the arbitrator hears the formal positions of both parties on 
outstanding, unresolved issues. The arbitrator then analyzes these positions and 
makes a decision on the possible resolution of the issues. If both sides have agreed 
in advance that the arbitration will be binding, they must accept the arbitrator’s 
decision.
This chapter ends our discussion of human resources. Next, we examine the mar-
keting function of business. We begin in Chapter 12 by discussing the meaning of the 
term marketing.

On the Friday after Thanksgiving in 2011, when repre-
sentatives for the basketball players met with represen-
tatives for the team owners and the league, the fate of 
the NBA’s 2011-12 season was at stake. The NBA had 
imposed a lockout after the previous collective bargaining 
agreement expired. Now the owners were negotiating to 
improve team profitability and the players were negotiat-
ing to avoid giving up basketball-related income.
Talks stretched from Friday into Saturday, and before 
dawn, the two sides came to agreement. The players would 
receive at least 50 percent and possibly more of the basket-
ball-related income, according to a complex formula. The 
owners would have some spending restrictions and make 
payments for better competitive and financial ­balance 
between teams. The players withdrew their lawsuits and 
applied to have their union recertified so they could ratify 
the new contract. Owners began signing players, and the 
shortened season got underway on December 25.
Questions
1.	 After mediation failed to help resolve the issues 
between players and owners, do you think arbitration 
should have been the next step? Explain your answer.
2.	 What are the advantages and disadvantages of using 
a lockout when lengthy talks don’t lead to an agree-
ment and both players and owners will face heavy 
financial losses if games aren’t played?

Explain how and why labor unions came into 
being.
A labor union is an organization of workers who act together 
to negotiate wages and working conditions with their 
employers. Labor relations are the dealings between labor 
unions and business management.
The first major union in the United States was the 
Knights of Labor, formed in 1869 to eliminate the deper-
sonalization of workers. The Knights were followed in 1886 
by the American Federation of Labor (AFL). The goal of the 
AFL was to improve its members’ living standards without 
changing the business system. In 1905, the radical Industrial 
Workers of the World (IWW) was formed; its goal was to 
overthrow capitalism. Of these three, only the AFL remained 
when the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) was 
founded as a body of industrial unions between World War 
I and World War II. After years of competing, the AFL and 
CIO merged in 1955. The largest union not affiliated with 
the AFL–CIO is the Teamsters Union.
Discuss the sources of unions’ negotiating power 
and trends in union membership.
The power of unions to negotiate with management comes 
from two sources. The first is the size of their membership. 
The second is the groups of laws that guarantee unions the 
right to negotiate and that regulate the negotiation process. At 
present, union membership accounts for less than 15 percent 
of the American workforce, and it seems to be decreasing 
for various reasons. Nonetheless, unions wield considerable 
power in many industries—those in which their members 
comprise a large proportion of the workforce.
Many unions today are entering into partnerships with 
management rather than maintaining their traditional adver-
sarial position. Unions and management cooperate to increase 
production, improve quality, lower costs, empower workers, 
and enhance the workplace. Limited partnerships center on 
accomplishing one specific task or project. Long-range strate-
gic partnerships focus on sharing decision-making power for 
a range of workplace and business matters.
Identify the main focus of several major pieces of 
labor–management legislation.
Important laws that affect union power are the Norris–
LaGuardia Act (limits management’s ability to obtain 
injunctions against unions), the Wagner Act (forbids certain 
unfair labor practices by management), the Fair Labor 
Standards Act (allows the federal government to set the 
minimum wage and to mandate overtime rates), the Taft–
Hartley Act (forbids certain unfair practices by unions), and 
the Landrum–Griffin Act (regulates the internal functioning 
of labor unions). The National Labor Relations Board 
(NLRB), a federal agency that oversees union–management 
relations, was created by the Wagner Act.
Enumerate the steps involved in forming a union 
and show how the National Labor Relations 
Board is involved in the process.
Attempts to form a union within a firm begin with an 
organizing campaign to develop widespread employee interest 
in having a union. Next, employees sign authorization cards,

indicating in writing their support for the union. The 
third step is to hold a formal election to decide whether 
to have a union. Finally, if the union obtains a majority, 
it receives NLRB certification, making it the official 
bargaining agent for its members. The entire process is 
supervised by the NLRB, which oversees the organizing 
campaign, conducts the election, and certifies the election 
results.
Describe the basic elements of the collective-
bargaining process.
Once a union is established, it may negotiate a labor 
contract with management through the process of 
collective bargaining. First, the negotiating committee 
decides on its position on the various contract issues. 
The union informs management that it is ready to begin 
negotiations, and a time and place are set. The union 
is represented by the negotiating committee, and the 
organization is represented by managers from several 
departments in the company. Each side is required to 
negotiate in good faith and not to stall or attempt to 
extend the bargaining unnecessarily. The final step is 
5
ratification, which is approval of the contract by a vote of 
the union membership.
Identify the major issues covered in a union–
management contract.
As the expiration date of an existing contract approaches, 
management and the union begin to negotiate a new 
contract. Contract issues include employee pay and benefits, 
working hours, job and union security, management rights, 
and grievance procedures.
Explain the primary bargaining tools available to 
unions and management.
Management and unions can use certain tools to sway one 
another—and public opinion—during contract negotiations. 
Advertising and publicity help each side to gain support. 
When contract negotiations do not run smoothly, unions may 
apply pressure on management through strikes, slowdowns, 
or boycotts. Management may counter by imposing lockouts 
or hiring strikebreakers. Less drastic techniques for breaking 
contract deadlocks are mediation and arbitration. In both, a 
neutral third party is involved in the negotiations.

Chapter 11   Enhancing Union–Management Relations	
323
Most people probably don’t think “Hollywood” when they think 
“unions.” Perhaps they think of truck drivers, teachers, autowork-
ers, electricians, and other members of powerful and well-known 
labor unions. But in fact, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) is 
a long-standing and potent force in the media business and has 
been protecting and advocating for creative workers across the 
United States for over 50 years.
The Guild consists of two separate unions that are loosely 
linked but often act together—the Writers Guild East and the 
Writers Guild West. It’s a not-for-profit organization whose 
members include thousands of graphic artists and writers for 
motion pictures, television, radio, newscasts, and increasingly 
the Internet. One direct result of the three-month writers’ strike 
in 2008 was the Guild’s extension of its jurisdiction to include 
Internet content, and the organization is now in the process 
of developing rules to protect and govern its members’ work 
online. The Guild has created the position of New Media Project 
Manager for this purpose.
As one writer associated with a late-night TV talk show observed, 
in the entertainment business “all ideas start with the writer. 
Without writers you don’t have a business at all—we start the ball 
rolling.” That’s the kind of pride in authorship that members of the 
Guild readily feel with the power of their union behind them.
The main purpose of the Writers Guild union is to protect its 
members, ensuring they get proper credit for their work and are 
properly paid. Compensation for scriptwriters consists of two 
parts: up-front money, which is paid on delivery of the work, and 
residuals, which are continuing payments made when the work is 
reused—for instance, when a show is rerun or goes into syndica-
tion. One way the Guild protects members is by receiving their 
residuals directly from the networks and other broadcasters, so it 
can check their accuracy before turning the money over to the indi-
vidual writer who earned it. The Guild maintains a complex moni-
toring system that allows it to track reruns and verify payments 
and crediting. When something goes wrong—if someone isn’t 
properly paid or credited—the Guild will step in on the writer’s 
behalf. In the event of disagreements, the Guild will take the case 
to arbitration to ensure the writer gets what he or she has earned.
Most networks are closed shops, meaning writers must belong 
to the union to work there. In return, the Guild provides benefits 
like health care plans and pensions. Members’ income can range 
widely, so the Guild makes special efforts to draw them together 
and develop the kind of solidarity that can make picketing and 
strikes effective. Recently, for instance, almost 1,000 WGA mem-
bers filed a class-action lawsuit against two leading talent agen-
cies claiming age discrimination. A $4.5 million settlement fund 
was the result.
Picketing has been successful, too. WGA picket lines recently 
won members protection against employers’ ability to fire work-
ers at will (employment at will means an employee can be fired 
at any time for almost any reason and with few legal rights). 
And strikes, while costly to all parties, can get good, if imperfect, 
results for union members. The 2008 writers’ strike, for instance, 
sought a penny increase in the fee writers earned from the sale of 
movie videos and a percentage of the income from foreign sales 
of films (many U.S. films earn even more money abroad than they 
do at home). After three long months of a strike that disrupted 
the fall seasons of many top-rated TV shows and left other work-
ers associated with those shows temporarily out of work, the 
strike ended with the achievement of only one of the goals—the 
percentage of foreign sales. Union officials were satisfied that the 
deal made everyone at least a little bit happy, and from that per-
spective it was a good outcome.
The WGA continues to support creative workers in the enter-
tainment area. Writers Guild West recently came out in support 
of Hollywood’s composers and lyricists, who are currently not 
unionized but are seeking entry to Teamsters Local 399. “We’re 
very supportive,” said a Guild spokesperson. “We consider com-
posers and lyricists our colleagues, and we believe they deserve 
the benefits of a union contract.”21
Questions
	 1.	 Should union members in nonessential industries like enter-
tainment have the right to strike when their actions may put 
others out of work as well?
	 2.	 Do you think a labor dispute outcome that leaves both sides 
partly satisfied is a good outcome? Why or why not?
	 3.	 Union membership in the United States has been on a 
slow decline for about 30 years. What factors do you think 
account for this drop?

What happens when unionized nurses and hospital admin-
istrators do not agree? Not long ago, the California Nurses 
Association threatened a one-day strike against dozens of 
California hospitals. The union wanted to call attention to its 
serious concerns about hospitals’ preparations for protecting 
nurses against the potentially deadly H1N1 swine flu. At the time, 
200 people in California had died from the flu strain, and hospi-
tals around the state were coping with an influx of patients suffer-
ing from swine flu. The union was also in the middle of negotiat-
ing a new contract for its members, seeking higher pay and higher 
staffing levels than specified in the previous contract, which had 
expired months earlier.

Part 4   Human Resources
Only days before the strike was scheduled to take place, how-
ever, it was called off as union negotiators and hospital adminis-
trators sat down with a federal mediator and worked to resolve 
their differences. The two sides were able to reach an agreement, 
and the union’s members ratified the contract, which included 
extra safety precautions to protect nurses against swine flu.
This is only one example of how complex the negotiations 
can be when nurses’ unions and hospital management disagree. 
Adding to the challenge, the U.S. health care system is currently 
facing two conflicting issues: a shortage of nurses and pressure 
to contain costs while providing proper medical care. The qual-
ity of care is, in fact, an important consideration for both sides, 
especially in light of research published by the National Bureau of 
Economic Research. Covering 50 nurses’ strikes in New York state 
hospitals over 20 years, the study found higher mortality rates 
and higher readmission rates among patients hospitalized during 
the strikes, even when hospitals hired replacement nurses to cover 
for those on the picket line.
Because the stakes are so high, some nurses’ unions are 
banding together to boost their advocacy efforts. In 2009, 
the California Nurses Association, the Massachusetts Nurses 
Association, and the United American Nurses merged to create 
National Nurses United, a union with 150,000 members across 
the nation. The union’s top priority is to lobby for a higher ratio 
of nurses to patients.
Strikes are not the only way a nurses’ union can put the 
spotlight on their concerns. When members of the Washington 
State Nursing Association were unhappy with proposed contract 
changes that could limit rest breaks, the nurses walked an infor-
mational picket line outside the Providence Sacred Heart Medical 
Center. The nurses were worried about fatigue affecting the qual-
ity of care, and they wanted to ensure that they had a full ten 
minutes of break time every four hours to rest. Rather than call a 
strike, nurses carried explanatory picket signs outside the hospital 
before and after their regular shifts. This nurses’ union also set 
up an informational picket line when its contract negotiations 
with Tacoma General Hospital were stalled over pay increases and 
changes to retirement programs.
Sometimes nurses’ unions and hospital administrators disagree 
on other issues. The Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and 
Allied Professionals decided to strike Temple University Hospital 
in Pennsylvania after working without a contract for months. One 
of the key reasons was to protest a clause preventing union lead-
ers and members from publicly criticizing hospital administration 
and staff. The hospital’s CEO said the “non-disparagement” clause 
would not prevent nurses from alerting administrators to concerns 
about patient care. Other issues included pay, retirement programs, 
and college-tuition benefits for the children of hospital workers. 
The hospital hired 850 temporary nurses to maintain staffing levels 
during the strike, which lasted for a month. At the end, union and 
hospital negotiators bargained for days about the issues that had 
divided them, reached an agreement acceptable to both sides, and 
the union promptly ratified the new multiyear contract.22
Questions
	 1.	 Identify the major issues that have led to disagreements 
between nurses’ unions and hospitals. Which do you think 
are most important for each side, and why?
	 2.	 Why would a nurses’ union choose an informational picket 
instead of a strike when it wants to call attention to impor-
tant contract issues?
	 3.	 Should U.S. lawmakers forbid nurses’ unions from striking 
unless mediation and arbitration fail to settle their disputes 
with management?

landed safely and taxied to the terminal. The flight crew advised 
the maintenance and operations crews of the incident. Operations 
grounded the plane until it could be inspected, but because of 
the time of day, maintenance personnel available to perform the 
inspection were in short supply. A supervisor, calling from an 
overtime list, made calls until contacting two available off-duty 
mechanics. They worked on overtime pay to perform the inspec-
tion and return the aircraft to a safe flying status. Several days 
after the inspection, a mechanic on the overtime list who was not 
home when the supervisor called complained that she had been 
denied overtime. This union member believed that the company 
owed her overtime pay for the same number of hours worked by a 
mechanic who performed the actual inspection. The company dis-
agreed. What options are available to resolve this conflict?
Assignment
1.	 Using the following questions as guidelines, determine how 
this dispute can be resolved.
a.	 What options are available to the unhappy mechanic? 
What process must she pursue? How does this process 
work?
b.	 Do you believe that the mechanic should receive pay for 
the time she did not work? Justify your answer.
c.	 What do you think was the final outcome of this conflict?
2.	 Prepare a report describing how you would resolve this situa-
tion.
4 	BUILDING TEAM SKILLS
For more than a century, American unions have played an impor-
tant role in the workplace, striving to improve the working condi-
tions and quality of life of employees. Today, federal laws cover 
many of the workers’ rights that unions first championed. For this 
reason, some people believe that unions are no longer necessary. 
According to some experts, however, as technology changes the 
workplace and as cultural diversity and the number of part-time 
workers increase, unions will increase their memberships and 
become stronger as we move into the new century. What do you 
think?
Assignment
1.	 Form a “pro” group and a “con” group and join one of them.
2.	 Debate whether unions will be stronger or weaker in the next 
century.
3.	 Record the key points for each side.
4.	 Summarize what you learned about unions and their useful-
ness in a report, and state your position on the debated issue.
5 	RESEARCHING DIFFERENT CAREERS
When applying for a job, whether mailing or faxing in your 
résumé, you should always include a letter of application, or 
a cover letter, as it is often called. A well-prepared cover letter 
should convince the prospective employer to read your résumé 
and to phone you for an interview. The letter should describe the 
job you want and your qualifications for the job. It should also 
let the firm know where you can be reached to set up an appoint-
ment for an interview.
Assignment
1.	 Prepare a letter of application to use with the résumé you 
prepared in Chapter 9. (An example appears in Appendix A 
online.)
2.	 After having several friends review your letter, edit it carefully.
3.	 Ask your instructor to comment on your letter.
Although you might think working for an ice-cream com-
pany would be motivating under almost any circumstances, 
Graeter’s doesn’t take its employees’ commitment for granted.  
Including full-time and part-time seasonal workers, the com-
pany employs about 800 people in three production facilities 
and dozens of ice-cream shops. Teenagers who take a sum-
mer job at a Graeter’s shop often return to help out during 
the winter holidays and then come back to work the following 
summer, and the summer after that. Production employees 
tend to remain with the company for long periods, as well, 
and Graeter’s is relying on their experience and expertise as it 
expands its national distribution and opens new stores far from 
the Cincinnati base.

Part 4   Human Resources
(HRM) procedures, including those for hiring and evaluating 
employees. David Blink, the company’s controller, explains: “We 
hire based on potential. . . . We are looking for people who are 
conscientious about their work, who do a good job, who show 
up every day. We are a fun place to work. . . . We have turnover 
based on seasonal work only because we hire a lot of college 
kids [and] high school kids” to work during the summer months. 
Managers begin recruiting during the spring so that each store is 
fully staffed in advance of the peak ice cream buying season. The 
company also accepts job applications through its website.
When filling job openings at its three factories, Graeter’s 
looks for people with baking industry skills. On the job, 
employees and managers alike wear name badges that show 
the number of years they have worked for the firm, “and that is 
a proud number,” says Blink. Graeter’s adds a personal touch 
by celebrating employees’ birthdays and milestones such as 25 
years of service with the firm. 
According to a consultant who works with top manage-
ment, goals and measurement systems weren’t strongly empha-
sized in the company’s early days. “If [employees] came in and 
they made ice cream, if they made enough for the week, for the 
day, that was enough,” he says. These days, however, Graeter’s 
sets specific production and store goals so that all employees 
know what is expected of them. It also has measurement sys-
tems in place to track progress toward those goals. “We have 
defined the behaviors that are acceptable and not acceptable 
within the company,” the consultant continues. “We commu-
nicate that. We teach and educate people.” At the retail level, 
Graeter’s training focuses on how employees can make the in-
store experience engaging, fun, and memorable for customers. 
In the factory, higher production goals have given newly 
empowered employees achievements to boast about on the 
slogan T-shirts they wear. The workforce is eager to submit 
suggestions for improvement, and morale is high. The com-
pany also offers advancement opportunities for employees who 
are ready to take on more responsibility. Graeter’s low rate of 
turnover indicates that employees feel involved with the firm 
and the work they do. In fact, some employees spend their 
entire working careers with Graeter’s and eventually retire from 
the firm. 
BENEFITS THAT PAY
The benefits package for managers and full-time employees is 
competitive. Graeter’s offers profit sharing, and it has made 
a profit year after year. It also has a 401(k) retirement plan 
that matches employees’ contributions, plus a rolling allow-
ance for paid time-off that is separate from paid vacations and 
holidays, and is based on the employee’s tenure with the firm. 
Other benefits include medical, life, and disability insurance. 
Store employees wear uniforms (paid for by the company) and 
receive a 25 percent discount when they buy Graeter’s prod-
ucts. All managers and employees receive the training they need 
to be effective in their positions and to develop their profes-
sional skills.
“YOU CAN’T DO IT ALONE”
The management team has grown as the company moves 
forward with its aggressive nationwide expansion plans. CEO 
Richard Graeter, a great-grandson of the company’s founders, 
believes in recruiting outstanding people, compensating them 
well, and giving them the autonomy they need to get things 
done. “In the last few months,” he notes, “I have hired a vice 
president of sales and marketing . . . [and] we hired a vice 
president of finance, basically a CFO [chief financial officer] 
because we are big enough to support that . . . Identifying the 
gaps in your executive team and your talent pool, and going 
out and finding people to fill those gaps, is probably one of 
my most critical functions in addition to looking out to define 
the strategic direction of the company. I’ve got some wonderful 
people on the team now, and they are really helping us make 
the jump from a small business to a medium-sized business 
. . . People at that level, you’ve got to pay them well. It’s worth 
it, though . . . They can command the kind of salary they do 
because they bring the talent you need to navigate the waters.” 
“You can’t do it alone,” Richard concludes. “That is the other 
thing that I think my cousins and I all have come to realize; we 
can’t do it alone. Our fathers and aunt and the folks that came 
before them . . . they did it all, from figuring out where to build 
the next store to hanging up the laundry at the end of the day.” 
Now, to achieve the fast-growing company’s ambitious goals, he’s 
found that “you need to rely on talent that is beyond just you.”23
Questions
1.	 Imagine that you’re a human resources manager for 
Graeter’s. If you were writing the job specification for an 
entry-level, part-time employee who will serve customers 
in one of the scoop shops, what qualifications would you 
include, and why?
2.	 Food production facilities like the three Graeter’s factories 
must comply with strict regulations to ensure purity and 
safety. What kinds of teams might Graeter’s use in these 
facilities, and for what specific purposes?
3.	 Graeter’s is currently a non-union company. How might the 
experience of working there change if a union were to be 
introduced?

Chapter 11   Enhancing Union–Management Relations	
327
In this section of your business plan, you will expand on the type 
and quantity of employees that will be required to operate the 
business. Your human resources requirements are determined by 
the type of business and by the size and scale of your operation. 
From the preceding section, you should have a good idea of how 
many people you will need. Part 4 of your textbook, “Human 
Resources,” especially Chapters 9 and 10, should help you in 
answering some of the questions in this part of the business plan. 
THE HUMAN RESOURCES COMPONENT
To ensure successful performance by employees, you must inform 
workers of their specific job requirements. Employees must know 
what is expected of the job, and they are entitled to expect regular 
feedback on their work. It is vital to have a formal job description 
and job specification for every position in your business. Also, you 
should establish procedures for evaluating performance.
The labor force component should include the answers to at 
least the following questions:
4.1	
How many employees will you require, and what qualifica-
tions should they have—including skills, experience, and 
knowledge? How many jobs will be full-time? Part-time?
4.2	
Will you have written job descriptions for each position?
4.3	
Have you prepared a job-application form? Do you know 
what can legally be included in it?
4.4	
What criteria will you use in selecting employees?
4.5	
Have you made plans for the orientation process?
4.6	
Who will do the training?
4.7	
What can you afford to pay in wages and salaries? Is this in 
line with the going rate in your region and industry?
4.8	
Who will evaluate your employees?
4.9	
Will you delegate any authority to employees?
4.10	 Have you developed a set of disciplinary rules?
4.11	 Do you plan to interview employees when they resign?
REVIEW OF BUSINESS PLAN ACTIVITIES
Remember that your employees are the company’s most valuable 
and important resource. Therefore, make sure that you expend a 
great deal of effort to acquire and make full use of this resource. 
Check and resolve any issues in this component of your business 
plan before beginning Part 5. Again, make sure that your answers 
to the questions in each part are consistent with the entire busi-
ness plan. Finally, write a brief statement that summarizes all the 
information for this part of the business plan.

At $62 a Pound, Single-Serve Coffee is Hot!
Nespresso knows that what makes single-serve coffee so hot is the ability to brew one very 
good cup of coffee in a very short time. Owned by the Swiss food giant Nestlé, Nespresso 
focuses on convenience and quality when it markets machines and coffee capsules to con-
sumers and businesses. Now its annual sales of $3 billion are growing at a rate of nearly 20 
percent per year as the company introduces dozens of new coffeemakers and compatible 
capsules for consumers, small businesses, and corporate use.
Although Nespresso’s machines and capsules are especially popular in Europe, where 
they were first introduced, the firm also targets coffee lovers in other countries where the 
“coffee culture” is strong. Customers view single-serve coffee or espresso as an affordable 
luxury, whether the economy is up or down. Nespresso makes it easy to reorder replace-
ment capsules online, by phone, or in one of 300 branded boutiques in 50 countries. For 
the convenience of premeasured, premium coffee in their choice of flavors and strengths, 
customers pay about 55 cents per capsule. This works out to about $62 per pound, and 
earns Nespresso a healthy profit margin from every cup.
As the single-serve coffee market heats up, Nespresso faces an increasingly competi-
tive marketing environment. For example, Vermont’s Green Mountain Coffee Roasters 
holds a sizable share of the U.S. market, thanks to its fast-selling Keurig coffee machines 
and ­individual K-Cup portions. In addition to marketing a variety of flavors under its own 
brand, Green Mountain makes K-Cups prefilled with Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts, and 
Newman’s Own coffees.
The competitive stakes are particularly high because Nespresso’s capsules don’t work 
in Keurig machines, and K-Cups don’t work in Nespresso machines. This is generally the 
case for other brands, as well. So when customers buy a single-serve coffeemaker, they’re 
also making a choice about the replacement capsules they will buy in the future. As a result, 
Nespresso’s marketers aren’t just selling a machine—they’re vying for the opportunity to 
sell each customer thousands of coffee, tea, and cocoa capsules at a sizable profit, year 
after year after year.1
N
umerous organizations, like Nepresso, use marketing efforts to provide cus-
tomer satisfaction and value. Understanding customers’ needs, such as “what’s 
cool,” is crucial to provide customer satisfaction. Although marketing encom-
passes a diverse set of decisions and activities, marketing always begins and ends with 
the customer. The American Marketing Association defines marketing as “The activity, 
set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging 
offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.”2 The mar-
keting process involves eight major functions and numerous related activities (see Table 
12.1). All of these are essential if the marketing process is to be effective.
In this chapter, we examine marketing activities that add value to products. We 
trace the evolution of the marketing concept and describe how organizations practice 
it. Next, our focus shifts to market classifications and marketing strategy. We analyze 
the four elements of a marketing mix and discuss uncontrollable factors in the mar-
keting environment. Then we examine the major components of a marketing plan. 
We consider tools for strategic market planning, including market measurement, sales 
forecasts, marketing information systems, and marketing research. Last, we look at the 
forces that influence consumer and organizational buying behavior.

Part 5   Marketing
Managing Customer Relationships
Marketing relationships with customers are the lifeblood of all businesses. Maintaining 
positive relationships with customers is an important goal for marketers. The term 
relationship marketing refers to “marketing decisions and activities focused on achieving 
long-term, satisfying relationships with customers.” Relationship marketing continually 
deepens the buyer’s trust in the company, which, as the customer’s loyalty grows, increases 
a company’s understanding of the customer’s needs and desires. Successful marketers 
respond to customers’ needs and strive to continually increase value to buyers over time. 
Eventually, this interaction becomes a solid relationship that allows for cooperation 
and mutual trust. The Internet has expanded and improved relationship 
marketing options for many firms by making targeted communication 
faster, cheaper, and easier. New digital technologies allow firms to 
connect to consumers and have a dialogue with them in real-time. This 
not only improves the speed at which firms can innovate, but it gives 
consumers a feeling that they are being listened to. Some firms specialize 
in cultivating this relationship. Sparks and Honey, for example, is a 
trend-spotting agency started by advertising holding company Omnicom 
Group. Sparks and Honey seeks to take advantage of the technological 
forces that are remaking the advertising industry through utilizing social 
media, Twitter, and YouTube to identify and market the products that 
consumers currently like and want.3
To build long-term customer relationships, marketers are increas-
ingly turning to marketing research and information technology. 
Customer relationship management (CRM) focuses on using infor-
mation about customers to create marketing strategies that develop and 
sustain desirable customer relationships. By increasing customer value 
over time, organizations try to retain and increase long-term profitabil-
ity through customer loyalty. Because CRM is such an important part 
of creating and building customer loyalty, many companies offer high-
tech products aimed at helping firms to identify good customers and 
to manage relations with them over the long-term. The accessibility of 
technology has contributed to a more even playing field for firms of all 
Exchange functions: All companies—manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers—buy and sell to market their merchandise.
1.  Buying includes obtaining raw materials to make products, knowing how much merchandise to keep on hand, and selecting 
suppliers.
2.  Selling creates possession utility by transferring the title of a product from seller to customer.
Physical distribution functions: These functions involve the flow of goods from producers to customers. Transportation and 
storage provide time utility and place utility and require careful management of inventory.
3.  Transporting involves selecting a mode of transport that provides an acceptable delivery schedule at an acceptable price.
4.  Storing goods is often necessary to sell them at the best selling time.
Facilitating functions: These functions help the other functions to take place.
5.  Financing helps at all stages of marketing. To buy raw materials, manufacturers often borrow from banks or receive credit 
from suppliers. Wholesalers may be financed by manufacturers, and retailers may receive financing from the wholesaler or 
manufacturer. Finally, retailers often provide financing to customers.
6.  Standardization sets uniform specifications for products or services. Grading classifies products by size and quality, usually 
through a sorting process. Together, standardization and grading facilitate production, transportation, storage, and selling.
7.  Risk taking—even though competent management and insurance can minimize risks—is a constant reality of marketing 
because of such losses as bad-debt expense, obsolescence of products, theft by employees, and product-liability lawsuits.
8.  Gathering market information is necessary for making all marketing decisions.

Who do customers want? Like many other 
organizations, airline companies spend a considerable 
amount of money on marketing programs to develop 
and maintain long-term relationships with their 
customers—especially the valuable ones. Sometimes it’s 
more profitable to retain these customers by offering 
them big rewards than attracting new customers who 
may never develop the same loyalty.

sizes. Software and programs such as Batchbook and Mailchimp allow even very small 
companies to manage customers and maintain consistent communication with them.4
Managing customer relationships requires identifying patterns of buying behavior 
and using this information to focus on the most promising and profitable customers. 
Companies must be sensitive to customers’ requirements and desires and establish 
communication to build customers’ trust and loyalty. In some instances, it may be more 
profitable for a company to focus on satisfying a valuable existing customer than to 
attempt to attract a new one who may never develop the same level of loyalty. This 
involves determining how much the customer will spend over his or her lifetime. The 
customer lifetime value (CLV) is a measure of a customer’s worth (sales minus costs) 
to a business during one’s lifetime.5 However, there are also intangible benefits of 
retaining lifetime-value customers, such as their ability to provide feedback to a com-
pany and refer new customers of similar value. The amount of money a company is 
willing to spend to retain such customers is also a factor. In general, when marketers 
focus on customers chosen for their lifetime value, they earn higher profits in future 
periods than when they focus on customers selected for other reasons.6 Thanks to 
technological innovations and improved research, it is a fairly straightforward task to 
calculate CLV these days. In fact there are many online calculators that companies can 
utilize, including one created by Harvard University.7 Because the loss of a potential 
lifetime customer can result in lower profits, managing customer relationships has 
become a major focus of marketers.
Utility: The Value Added by Marketing
As defined in Chapter 8, utility is the ability of a good or service to satisfy a human 
need. The latest iPad, Nike Zoom running shoes, or Mercedes Benz luxury car all 
satisfy human needs. Thus, each possesses utility. There are four kinds of utility.
Form utility is created by converting production inputs into finished products. 
Marketing efforts may influence form utility indirectly because the data gathered as 
part of marketing research are frequently used to determine the size, shape, and fea-
tures of a product.
The three kinds of utility that are created directly by marketing are place, time, and 
possession utility. Place utility is created by making a product available at a location 
Explain how marketing adds

forms of utility.

finished products
place utility  utility created by

purchase it
Is the customer always right? When customers 
return a broken product to Kohler, which 
makes kitchen and bathroom fixtures, the 
company nearly always offers a replacement, 
to maintain good customer relations. Still, “there are times 
you’ve got to say ‘no,’” explains a Kohler warranty expert, 
such as when a product is undamaged or has been abused. 
Entrepreneur Lauren Thorp, who owns the e-commerce 
company Umba Box, says, “While the customer is ‘always’ 
right, sometimes you just have to fire a customer.” When 
Thorp has tried everything to resolve a complaint and realizes 
that the customer will be dissatisfied no matter what, she 
returns her attention to the rest of her customers, who she 
says are “the reason for my success.”
What about customers who hurt other customers? On Black 
Friday, at the start of the Christmas gift-buying season, some 
customers waiting for bargains have started fights or broken store 
fixtures. What about customers who abuse marketers’ policies? 
Costco traditionally offered a money-back guarantee on everything. 
A few years ago, however, the retailer noticed that some customers 
were returning older televisions, receiving refunds, and then buying 
newer models at lower prices. To stop these practices, Costco now 
offers a 90-day return policy on electronics and invites customers 
to call a toll-free hotline for technical assistance.

where customers wish to purchase it. A pair of shoes is given place utility when it is 
shipped from a factory to a department store.
Time utility is created by making a product available when customers wish to 
purchase it. For example, Halloween costumes may be manufactured in April but 
not displayed until late September, when consumers start buying them. By storing the 
­costumes until they are wanted, the manufacturer or retailer provides time utility.
Possession utility is created by transferring title (or ownership) of a product to 
a buyer. For a product as simple as a pair of shoes, ownership usually is transferred 
by means of a sales slip or receipt. For such products as automobiles and homes, the 
transfer of title is a more complex process. Along with the title to its products, the seller 
transfers the right to use that product to satisfy a need (see Figure 12.1).
Place, time, and possession utility have real value in terms of both money and con-
venience. This value is created and added to goods and services through a wide variety 
of marketing activities—from research indicating what customers want to product 
warranties ensuring that customers get what they pay for. Overall, these marketing 
activities account for about half of every dollar spent by consumers. When they are 
part of an integrated marketing program that delivers maximum utility to the cus-
tomer, many would agree that they are worth the cost.
Place, time, and possession utility are only the most fundamental applications of 
marketing activities. In recent years, marketing activities have been influenced by a 
broad business philosophy known as the marketing concept.
The Marketing Concept
The marketing concept is a business philosophy that a firm should provide goods 
and services that satisfy customers’ needs through a coordinated set of activities that 
allow the firm to achieve its objectives. Thus, initially, the firm must communicate 
with potential customers to assess their product needs. Then, the firm must develop a 
good or service to satisfy those needs. Finally, the firm must continue to seek ways to 
provide customer satisfaction. This process is an application of the marketing concept 
or marketing orientation. After years of declining sales related to poor product quality 
and not satisfying customers’ demands adequately, Captain D’s fast-food seafood 
chain overhauled its marketing approach and implemented the marketing concept. 
Under new management, the restaurant spent years investing in future success and 
Putting products at the 
customer’s fingertips. Firms 
try to provide customers with 
products whenever and wherever 
they need them.

increased customer loyalty though improved products, improved 
service, hiring new management talent, and even new decor for its 
restaurants. The investments have paid off with increased sales and 
improved customer satisfaction and loyalty.8
Evolution of the Marketing Concept
From the start of the Industrial Revolution until the early 20th 
century, business effort was directed mainly toward the production 
of goods. Consumer demand for manufactured products was so 
great that manufacturers could almost bank on selling everything 
they produced. Business had a strong production orientation, in 
which emphasis was placed on increased output and production 
efficiency. Marketing was limited to taking orders and distributing 
finished goods.
In the 1920s, production caught up with and began to exceed 
demand. Now producers had to direct their efforts toward sell-
ing goods rather than just producing goods that consumers readily 
bought. This new sales orientation was characterized by increased 
advertising, enlarged sales forces, and, occasionally, high-pres-
sure selling techniques. Manufacturers produced the goods they 
expected consumers to want, and marketing consisted primarily 
of promoting products through personal selling and advertising, taking orders, and 
delivering goods.
During the 1950s, however, businesspeople started to realize that even enormous 
advertising expenditures and the most thoroughly proven sales techniques were not 
enough. Something else was needed if products were to sell as well as expected. It was 
then that business managers recognized that they were not primarily producers or 
sellers but rather were in the business of satisfying customers’ needs. Marketers real-
ized that the best approach was to adopt a customer orientation—in other words, the 
organization had to first determine what customers need and then develop goods and 
services to fill those particular needs (see Table 12.2).
All functional areas—research and development, production, finance, human 
resources, and, of course, marketing—are viewed as playing a role in providing cus-
tomer satisfaction.
Implementing the Marketing Concept
To implement the marketing concept, a firm first must obtain information about its 
present and potential customers. The firm must determine not only what customers’ 
needs are but also how well these needs are being satisfied by products currently in 
the market—both its own products and those of competitors. It must ascertain how 
its products might be improved and what opinions customers have about the firm and 
its marketing efforts.
Tell us what you really think. Customer satisfaction 
is a major element of the marketing concept. Many 
businesses attempt to measure customer satisfaction  
through surveys. Surveys can be conducted in a variety 
of ways: in-person, by mail or fax, or online. Online 
surveys have made it very inexpensive for firms to 
gather customer feedback.

market  a group of individuals or 
organizations, or both, that need 
products in a given category and 
that have the ability, willingness, 
and authority to purchase such 
products
The firm then must use this information to pin-
point the specific needs and potential customers 
toward which it will direct its marketing activities and 
resources. Next, the firm must mobilize its market-
ing resources to (1) provide a product that will satisfy 
its customers, (2) price the product at a level that is 
acceptable to buyers and that will yield an acceptable 
profit, (3) promote the product so that potential cus-
tomers will be aware of its existence and its ability 
to satisfy their needs, and (4) ensure that the product 
is distributed so that it is available to customers where and 
when needed.
Finally, the firm must again obtain marketing 
­information—this time regarding the effectiveness of its 
efforts. Can the product be improved? Is it being promoted 
properly? Is it being distributed efficiently? Is the price too 
high or too low? The firm must be ready to modify any or 
all of its marketing activities based on information about 
its customers and competitors. Sears’ Kenmore brand, for 
example, has become an iconic American brand of appli-
ances. However, as the brand neared its 85-year mark, man-
agers noticed that the aging brand was not in high demand 
among the younger generation. Sears decided to rebrand 
Kenmore, modernizing it with a focus on sophisticated, 
contemporary styling and increased energy efficiency. Sears 
launched a new advertising campaign that featured real cus-
tomers and used the tagline “Kenmore, That’s Genius.” This 
campaign was launched through advertisements on televi-
sion and online at Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. Sears 
hopes that this rebranding will help Kenmore appeal to the younger generations as 
the market adjusts.9
Markets and Their Classification
A market is a group of individuals or organizations, or both, that need products in a 
given category and that have the ability, willingness, and authority to purchase such 
products. Markets are broadly classified as consumer or business-to-business markets 
because marketing efforts vary depending on the intended market. Marketers should 
understand the general characteristics of these two groups.
Consumer markets consist of purchasers and/or household members who intend 
to consume or benefit from the purchased products and who do not buy products 
to make profits. Business-to-business markets, also called industrial markets, are 
grouped broadly into producer, reseller, governmental, and institutional categories. 
These markets purchase specific kinds of products for use in making other products 
for resale or for day-to-day operations. Producer markets consist of individuals and 
business organizations that buy certain products to use in the manufacture of other 
products. Reseller markets consist of intermediaries such as wholesalers and retail-
ers, who buy finished products and sell them for a profit. Governmental markets 
consist of federal, state, county, and local governments. They buy goods and ser-
vices to maintain internal operations and to provide citizens with such products as 
highways, education, water, energy, and national defense. Governmental purchases 
total billions of dollars each year. Institutional markets include churches, not-for-
profit private schools and hospitals, civic clubs, fraternities and sororities, charitable 
organizations, and foundations. Their goals are different from such typical business 
goals as profit, market share, or return on investment.

Developing Marketing 
Strategies
A marketing strategy is a plan that will enable an organization 
to make the best use of its resources and advantages to meet its 
objectives. A marketing strategy consists of (1) the selection and 
analysis of a target market and (2) the creation and maintenance 
of an appropriate marketing mix, a combination of product, 
price, distribution, and promotion developed to satisfy a 
particular target market.
Target Market Selection and Evaluation
A target market is a group of individuals or organizations, or both, 
for which a firm develops and maintains a marketing mix suitable 
for the specific needs and preferences of that group. In selecting 
a target market, marketing managers examine potential markets 
for their possible effects on the firm’s sales, costs, and profits. The 
managers attempt to determine whether the organization has the 
resources to produce a marketing mix that meets the needs of a 
particular target market and whether satisfying these needs is 
consistent with the firm’s overall objectives. They also analyze the 
strengths and number of competitors already marketing to people in 
this target market. Marketing managers may define a target market 
as a sizable number of people or a relatively small group. The 
Nissan Cube, for example, has features designed to attract teenagers 
and early 20-somethings, and the company ensured that the Cube’s 
promotion, price, and distribution were appropriate for this target 
market. Ideas for promoting this vehicle came straight from U.S. 
college students who competed to have their marketing strategy 
adopted by Nissan and are part of this vehicle’s target market.10 
On the other hand, Rolls-Royce targets its automobiles toward a 
small, very exclusive market: wealthy people who want the ultimate 
in prestige in an automobile. Other companies target multiple 
markets with different products, prices, distribution systems, and 
promotion for each one. For example, some high-end clothing designers target multiple 
markets through developing affordable lines distributed at mass market retail outlets, such 
as Target, Kmart, and Walmart. This strategy allows designers to target customers with 
different needs and levels of disposable income. High-end fashion houses like Rodarte and 
Jason Wu, whose haute couture designs sell for thousands of dollars, offered designs at 
Target that retailed for much lower prices. Discount clothing retailer H&M has pursued a 
similar tactic, offering reasonably priced items by pricey designers, such as Karl Lagerfeld. 
Such collaborations between high and low end help to broadcast a designer’s name among 
a large audience and provide positive publicity for both the retailers and the designer.11
Undifferentiated Approach  A company that designs a single marketing mix and 
directs it at the entire market for a particular product is using an undifferentiated 
approach (see Figure 12.2). This approach assumes that individual customers in the target 
market for a specific kind of product have similar needs and that the organization therefore 
can satisfy most customers with a single marketing mix. This single marketing mix consists 
of one type of product with little or no variation, one price, one promotional program 
aimed at everyone, and one distribution system to reach all customers in the total market. 
Products that can be marketed successfully with the undifferentiated approach include 
staple food items, such as sugar and salt, and certain kinds of farm produce. An undiffer-
entiated approach is useful in only a limited number of situations because for most product 
categories buyers have different needs. When customers’ needs vary, a company should use 
the market segmentation approach.

Reaching the right market segments. The market 
for moisturizers is segmented based on gender. Some 
skin care products are aimed at women, while  others, 
such as the LAB Series, are aimed at men.  There are 
very few brands of moisturizers that are aimed at both 
men and women.

Market Segmentation Approach  A firm that is marketing 40-foot yachts would 
not direct its marketing effort toward every person in the total boat market. Some 
might want a sailboat or a canoe. Others might want a speedboat or an outboard-
powered fishing boat. Still others might be looking for something resembling a small 
ocean liner. Marketing efforts directed toward such boat buyers would be wasted.
Instead, the firm would direct its attention toward a particular portion, or seg-
ment, of the total market for boats. A market segment is a group of individuals 
or organizations within a market that shares one or more common characteristics. 
The process of dividing a market into segments is called market segmentation. 
As shown in Figure 12.2, there are two types of market segmentation approaches: 
concentrated and differentiated. When an organization uses concentrated market 
segmentation, a single marketing mix is directed at a single market segment. If dif-
ferentiated market segmentation is used, multiple marketing mixes are focused on 
multiple market segments.
In our boat example, one common characteristic, or basis, for segmentation might 
be “end use of a boat.” The firm would be interested primarily in the market segment 
whose uses for a boat could lead to the purchase of a 40-foot yacht. Another basis for 
segmentation might be income, still another might be geographic location. Each of these 
variables can affect the type of boat an individual might purchase. When ­choosing a basis 
for segmentation, it is important to select a characteristic that relates to differences in 
people’s needs for a product. The yacht producer, for example, would not use religion to 
segment the boat market because people’s needs for boats do not vary based on religion.
Marketers use a wide variety of segmentation bases. Bases most commonly applied 
to consumer markets are shown in Table 12.3. Each may be used as a single basis for 
market segmentation or in combination with other bases. OfficeMax, for example, is 
typically considered to be in a not-so-dazzling industry with a very broad definition for its 
target market (people and businesses that need office supplies). Therefore, the company 
recently decided to completely reposition itself. Driven by new research on consumers’ 
shopping experiences and expectations, OfficeMax launched a national campaign called 
“Life Is Beautiful, Work Can Be Too,” which featured stylish new private-label product

individuals or organizations within

common characteristics

of dividing a market into segments 
and directing a marketing mix at 
a particular segment or segments 
rather than at the total market
Two pens, two different concentrated targeting strategies. Both Mont 
Blanc pens, which are expensive, and Bic pens, which are not, are marketed using a 
concentrated targeting strategy. Each one is aimed at a different market segment. They 
do not compete for the same customers. Which do you buy and why?

lines and a spiced-up catalog. OfficeMax has made a huge effort to separate itself from 
other office supply stores by further defining its target market based on research data 
that women are responsible for over 85 percent of office ­purchases.12
Creating a Marketing Mix
A business firm controls four important elements of marketing that it combines in a way 
that reaches the firm’s target market. These are the product itself, the price of the product, 
the means chosen for its distribution, and the promotion of the product. When combined, 
these four elements form a marketing mix (see Figure 12.3). Marketers for Toyota’s Scion 
brand automobiles developed a marketing mix to target consumers who are young and 
hip. Scion aims much of its marketing efforts at the 18 to 34 demographic. Around 
75% of Scion purchasers are new to the Scion brand. Many Scion customers are buying 
a car for the first time. Scion’s most recent advertising campaign, called iQ Therefore I 
Am, surrounded the release of the new Scion model, the iQ, and included a variety of 
online content, such as racy videos, an interactive car brochure to highlight features of the 
vehicle, and even an online museum of underground cultural movements. Also included in 
the Scion iQ marketing mix is a test drive program in major cities around the country and 
collaborative events with artists to underscore Scion’s affiliation with arts and music.13
A firm can vary its marketing mix by changing any one or more of these ingredients. 
Thus, a firm may use one marketing mix to reach one target market and a second, some-
what different, marketing mix to reach another target market. For example, most auto-
makers produce several different types and models of vehicles and aim them at different 
market segments based on the potential customers’ age, income, and other factors.
The product ingredient of the marketing mix includes decisions about the product’s 
design, brand name, packaging, warranties, and the like. When McDonald’s decides on 
brand names, package designs, sizes of orders, flavors of sauces, and recipes, these 
choices are all part of the product ingredient.
The pricing ingredient is concerned with both base prices and discounts of various 
kinds. Pricing decisions are intended to achieve particular goals, such as to maximize 
profit or even to make room for new models. The rebates offered by automobile manu-
facturers are a pricing strategy developed to boost low auto sales. Product and pricing 
are discussed in detail in Chapter 13.
The distribution ingredient involves not only transportation and storage but also 
the selection of intermediaries. How many levels of intermediaries should be used

The marketing mix consists of elements that the firm controls—product,  
price, distribution, and promotion. The firm generally has no  
control over forces in the marketing environment.

in the distribution of a particular product? Should the product be 
distributed as widely as possible or should distribution be restricted 
to a few specialized outlets in each area? Video rental retailers have 
had to make numerous decisions regarding distribution. Currently, 
Redbox, owned by Coinstar, has 24 percent of the video rental 
market share, Dish Network Corporation, who recently took over 
Blockbuster, has 14 percent, and Netflix has 5 percent.14 Fifteen 
years ago, almost all videos were distributed through brick-and-
mortar stores. Distribution decisions and activities are discussed in 
more detail in Chapter 14.
The promotion ingredient focuses on providing information to 
target markets. The major forms of promotion are advertising, per-
sonal selling, sales promotion, and public relations. These four forms 
are discussed in Chapter 15.
These ingredients of the marketing mix are controllable elements. 
A firm can vary each of them to suit its organizational goals, market-
ing goals, and target markets. As we extend our discussion of market-
ing strategy, we will see that the marketing environment includes a 
number of uncontrollable elements.
Marketing Strategy and the 
Marketing Environment
The marketing mix consists of elements that a firm controls and uses to reach its 
target market. In addition, the firm has control over such organizational resources as 
finances and information. These resources may be used to accomplish marketing goals,

too. However, the firm’s marketing activities are also 
affected by a number of external—and generally 
uncontrollable—forces. As Figure 12.3 illustrates, 
the following forces make up the external marketing 
environment:
●
●Economic forces—the effects of economic con-
ditions on customers’ ability and willingness to 
buy
●
●Sociocultural forces—influences in a society and its 
culture that result in changes in attitudes, beliefs, 
norms, customs, and lifestyles
●
●Political forces—influences that arise through the actions 
of elected and appointed officials
●
●Competitive forces—the actions of competitors, who 
are in the process of implementing their own marketing 
plans
●
●Legal and regulatory forces—laws that protect consum-
ers and competition and government regulations that 
affect marketing
●
●Technological forces—technological changes that can 
create new marketing opportunities or cause products 
to become obsolete almost overnight
These forces influence decisions about marketing-
mix ingredients. Changes in the environment can have 
a major impact on existing marketing strategies. In 
addition, changes in environmental forces may lead to 
abrupt shifts in customers’ needs. Consider the effect 
technological forces have had on printed newspapers: 
Years ago, very few people would have predicted that 
consumers would one day have no need for their daily 
newspaper. However, that day has come. Consumers 
want today’s news now and are able to access it online 
at any time.
Developing a Marketing Plan
A marketing plan is a written document that specifies an organization’s resources, 
objectives, marketing strategy, and implementation and control efforts to be used in 
marketing a specific product or product group. The marketing plan describes the firm’s 
current position or situation, establishes marketing objectives for the product, and 
specifies how the organization will attempt to achieve these objectives. Marketing 
plans vary with respect to the time period involved. Short-range plans are for one year 
or less, medium-range plans cover from over one year to five years, and long-range 
plans cover periods of more than five years.
Although time-consuming, developing a clear, well-written marketing plan is impor-
tant. The plan will be used for communication among the firm’s employees. It covers 
the assignment of responsibilities, tasks, and schedules for implementation. It specifies 
how resources are to be allocated to achieve marketing objectives. It helps marketing 
managers monitor and evaluate the performance of the marketing strategy. Because 
the forces of the marketing environment are subject to change, marketing plans have 
to be updated frequently. For instance, in spite of overtaking Burger King as the 
second-largest hamburger chain in the United States, Wendy’s has undertaken a mission

Online videos can add vitality to any marketing mix, 
helping companies engage, educate, and persuade 
customers. Whether a video shows a product demonstration 
or a customer testimonial, it can capture attention, build buzz, 
and highlight key features and benefits. Ford, for example, posts 
videos on YouTube, Facebook, and its Web site to spotlight its 
vehicles’ innovative features. Blendtec demonstrates the power 
of its blenders through its popular “Will it blend?” videos. 
Viewers can’t take their eyes off the screen as the CEO puts an 
iPod and other unlikely objects into a blender, turns it on, and 
the item is pulverized in just a few seconds.

to remake its marketing plan and revamp its image in order to gain market share 
and increase revenues. Wendy’s announced plans to reposition the restaurant chain 
as a more high-end competitor as it struggles to gain ground on McDonald’s, which 
brings in roughly four times as much annual revenue as either Wendy’s or Burger King. 
McDonald’s has experienced success through releasing healthier and more upscale 
menu items and Wendy’s hopes to make similar changes that respond to the marketing 
environment and consumer preferences. To helm this revamp of its marketing plan, the 
chain hired a new chief of marketing, a former Procter & Gamble executive.15
The major components of a marketing plan are shown in Table 12.4.
Market Measurement and Sales 
Forecasting 
Measuring the sales potential of specific types of market segments helps an organization 
to make some important decisions, such as the feasibility of entering new segments. The 
organization can also decide how best to allocate its marketing resources and activities 
among market segments in which it is already active. All such estimates should identify 
the relevant time frame. As with marketing plans, these estimates may be short-range 
plans, covering periods of less than one year; medium-range plans, covering one to five 
years; or long-range plans, covering more than five years. The estimates should also 
define the geographic boundaries of the forecast. For example, sales potential can be 
estimated for a city, county, state, or group of nations. Finally, analysts should indicate 
whether their estimates are for a specific product item, a product line, or an entire 
product category.
A sales forecast is an estimate of the amount of a product that an organization 
expects to sell during a certain period of time based on a specified level of marketing 
effort. Managers in different divisions of an organization rely on sales forecasts when 
they purchase raw materials, schedule production, secure financial resources, consider

plant or equipment purchases, hire personnel, and plan inventory levels. Because the 
accuracy of a sales forecast is so important, organizations often use several forecasting 
methods, including executive judgments, surveys of buyers or sales personnel, time-series 
analyses, correlation analyses, and market tests. The specific methods used depend on 
the costs involved, type of product, characteristics of the market, time span of the fore-
cast, purposes for which the forecast is used, stability of historical sales data, availability 
of the required information, and expertise and experience of forecasters. A number of 
companies utilize sales forecasting software to help with predictions. IBM, for example, 
uses economic and demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau combined with sales 
forecasting software to make its complicated short-term and long-term sales forecasting 
predictions.16
Marketing Information
The availability and use of accurate and timely information are critical to make 
effective marketing decisions. A wealth of marketing information is obtainable. There 
are two general ways to obtain it: through a marketing information system and through 
marketing research.
Marketing Information Systems
A marketing information system is a system for managing 
marketing information that is gathered continually from internal 
and external sources. Most of these systems are computer based 
because of the amount of data the system must accept, store, sort, 
and retrieve. Continual collection of data is essential if the system 
is to incorporate the most up-to-date information.
In concept, the operation of a marketing information system 
is simple. Data from a variety of sources are fed into the sys-
tem. Data from internal sources include sales figures, product and 
marketing costs, inventory levels, and activities of the sales force. 
Data from external sources relate to the organization’s suppliers, 
intermediaries, and customers; competitors’ marketing activities; 
and economic conditions. All these data are stored and processed 
within the marketing information system. Its output is a flow of 
information in the form that is most useful for making market-
ing decisions. This information might include daily sales reports 
by territory and product, forecasts of sales or buying trends, and 
reports on changes in market share for the major brands in a 
specific industry. Both the information outputs and their form 
depend on the requirements of the personnel in the organiza-
tion. No matter what the industry and its needs; marketers must 
be well versed in the latest technology in order to maximize the 
efficiency of MIS. Companies like Adobe, IBM, Google, Acxiom, 
and Merkle all offer high-tech tools to help marketers collect and 
process information, manage marketing initiatives, and generate 
reports.17
Marketing Research
Marketing research is the process of systematically gathering, 
recording, and analyzing data concerning a particular marketing 
problem. Thus, marketing research is used in specific situations 
to obtain information not otherwise available to decision makers. 
Marketing research is an important step of the marketing process

because it involves collecting and analyzing data on 
what consumers want and need; their consumption 
habits; trends; and anticipating changes in the marketing 
environment. For example, a recent study of car buyers 
suggests that there is a correlation between political 
party affiliation and automobile model preference. The 
study demonstrates that Democrats prefer smaller more 
affordable cars, like the Honda Civic, while Republicans 
opt for larger, pricier models, such as the Ford Mustang. 
Such information can help marketers to determine target 
markets, marketing mixes, and other factors.18
Table 12.5 outlines a six-step procedure for conducting 
marketing research. This procedure is particularly well-suited 
to test new products, determine various characteristics of con-
sumer markets, and evaluate promotional activities. Food-
processing companies, such as Kraft Foods and Kellogg’s, 
use a variety of marketing research methods to avoid costly 
mistakes in introducing the wrong products, not to men-
tion introducing products in the wrong way or at the wrong 
time. They have been particularly interested in using market-
ing research to learn more about the African-American and 
Hispanic markets. Understanding of the food preferences, 
loyalties, and purchase motivators of these groups enables 
companies to serve them better.

Table 12.5	
The Six Steps of Marketing Research
1.  Define the problem.
In this step, the problem is stated clearly and accurately to 
determine what issues are involved in the research, what 
questions to ask, and what types of solutions are needed. 
This is a crucial step that should not be rushed.
2.  Make a preliminary 
investigation.
The objective of preliminary investigation is to develop both 
a sharper definition of the problem and a set of tentative 
answers. The tentative answers are developed by examining 
internal information and published data and by talking with 
persons who have some experience with the problem. These 
answers will be tested by further research.
3.  Plan the research.
At this stage, researchers know what facts are needed to 
resolve the identified problem and what facts are available. 
They make plans on how to gather needed but missing data.
4.  Gather factual 
information.
Once the basic research plan has been completed, the needed 
information can be collected by mail, telephone, or personal 
interviews; by observation; or from commercial or government 
data sources. The choice depends on the plan and the 
available sources of information.
5.  Interpret the 
information.
Facts by themselves do not always provide a sound solution 
to a marketing problem. They must be interpreted and 
analyzed to determine the choices available to management.
6.  Reach a conclusion.
Sometimes the conclusion or recommendation becomes 
obvious when the facts are interpreted. However, in other 
cases, reaching a conclusion may not be so easy because of 
gaps in the information or intangible factors that are difficult 
to evaluate. If and when the evidence is less than complete, it 
is important to say so.

Part 5   Marketing
Using Technology to Gather and 
Analyze Marketing Information
Technology is making information for marketing decisions increasingly accessible. 
The ability of firms to track the purchase behaviors of customers electronically and to 
better determine what they want is changing the nature of marketing. The integration 
of telecommunications with computing technology provides marketers with access 
to accurate information not only about customers and competitors but also about 
industry forecasts and business trends.
A database is a collection of information arranged for easy access and retrieval. 
Using databases, marketers tap into internal sales reports, newspaper articles, 
company news releases, government economic reports, bibliographies, and more. 
Many marketers use commercial databases, such as LEXIS-NEXIS, to obtain use-
ful information for marketing decisions. The Internet has made available a great 
deal of information that used to be obtainable only for a high price from compa-
nies specializing in producing commercial databases. However, sometimes firms 
still need to access the broad and in-depth information contained in large com-
mercial databases, such as Dun & Bradsteet’s Global Commercial database, with 
205 million business records.19
Information provided by a single firm on household demographics, purchases, 
television viewing behavior, and responses to promotions such as coupons and 
free samples is called single-source data. For example, Behavior Scan, offered by 
Information Resources, Inc., screens about 60,000 households in 26 U.S. markets. 
This single-source information service monitors household televisions and records 
the programs and commercials viewed. When buyers from these households shop in 
stores equipped with scanning registers, they present Hotline cards (similar to credit 
cards) to cashiers. This enables each customer’s identification to be coded electroni-
cally so that the firm can track each product purchased and store the information in 
a database.
Online information services offer subscribers access to e-mail, Web sites, down-
loadable files, news, databases, and research materials. By subscribing to mailing lists,

and, based on response, chose an image featuring chocolate 
chips “flying” off the cookie.
Magazines are also using neuroscience for marketing 
research. New Scientist magazine measured the brainwaves of 
readers to understand how they react to cover art. Putting the 
results into practice, one issue with a specially-designed cover 
enjoyed 12 percent higher newsstand sales compared with the 
previous year. Also, Time magazine is using neuroscience to 
gauge consumer involvement in the ads that accompany its iPad 
apps. Although neuroscience won’t replace traditional research 
techniques, it’s another tool for collecting data for marketing 
decisions.

Marketers are beginning to use neuroscience—
studying the brain and the nervous system—
to learn more about the inner workings of 
consumer behavior. For example, when Frito-Lay 
wanted to dig deeper into consumers’ reactions to its 
Cheetos, it hired a company to measure the brain waves of 
consumers as they snacked on the cheese puffs. The research 
showed that consumers enjoyed the messy orange cheese 
crumbs that Cheetos leave all over their fingers. Based on this 
research, Frito-Lay has used messy-fingers visuals in its ads and 
Facebook messages.
The Nabisco cookie brand Chips Ahoy! used insights from 
neuroscience when redesigning a package. Previous research 
showed that consumers placed a high value on resealable 
packaging, so researchers tested different ways to highlight the 
new design’s resealability tab. They also tested package images

marketers can receive electronic newsletters and participate in online discussions with 
other network users. This ability to communicate online with customers, suppliers, and 
employees improves the capability of a firm’s marketing information system and helps 
the company track its customers’ changing desires and buying habits.
The Internet has evolved as a powerful communication medium, linking cus-
tomers and companies around the world. Growth in Internet use has given rise to 
an entire industry that makes marketing information easily accessible to both com-
panies and customers. Among the many Web pages useful for marketing research 
are the home pages of Nielsen marketing research and Advertising Age. While most 
Web pages are open to all Internet users, some companies, such as U.S. West and 
Turner Broadcasting System, also maintain internal Web pages, called intranets, 
which allow employees to access internal data and facilitate communication among 
departments.
Table 12.6 contains a variety of sources of secondary information, which is exist-
ing information that has been gathered by other organizations. Many of these sources 
are available through Web sites. As can be seen in Table 12.6, secondary information 
can be obtained from a variety of sources including government sources, trade associa-
tions, general publications and news sources, and corporate information.
A tool that has recently gained popularity as a means of marketing research is 
social media. Many companies have begun using various social media outlets to solicit

feedback from customers on the company’s existing or upcoming products. However, 
a risk of being involved in social media is exposing your company to unwanted or 
negative information from the general public. Nevertheless, these comments need to 
be regarded as useful and viable information from a marketing research standpoint. 
Customer complaints are opportunities for improvement; if handled correctly, they can 
be an invaluable source of data.
Types of Buying Behavior
Buying behavior may be defined as the decisions and actions of people involved in 
buying and using products.20 Consumer buying behavior refers to the purchasing 
of products for personal or household use, not for business purposes. Business 
buying behavior is the purchasing of products by producers, resellers, governmental 
units, and institutions. Because a firm’s success depends greatly on buyers’ reactions 
to a particular marketing strategy, it is important to understand buying behavior. 
Marketing managers are better able to predict customer responses to marketing 
strategies and to develop a satisfying marketing mix if they are aware of the factors 
that affect buying behavior.
Consumer Buying Behavior
Consumers’ buying behaviors differ when they buy different types of products. For 
frequently purchased low-cost items, a consumer uses routine response behavior involving 
very little search or decision-making effort. The buyer uses limited decision making for 
purchases made occasionally or when more information is needed about an unknown 
product in a well-known product category. When buying an unfamiliar, expensive item 
or one that is seldom purchased, the consumer engages in extended decision making. 
Increasingly, consumers are empowered by information found on the Internet. It allows 
consumers to compare prices and features and read reviews about products before 
they even step in a store. In situations where they would have relied on salespeople 
A buyer goes through some or all of these steps when making a purchase.

in the past, consumers feel informed enough by online 
research to make purchasing decisions themselves. In this 
new environment, marketing and customer service are 
increasingly important.21
A person deciding on a purchase goes through 
some or all of the steps shown in Figure 12.4. First, the 
consumer acknowledges that a problem exists. A prob-
lem is usually the lack of a product or service that is 
desired or needed. Then, the buyer looks for informa-
tion, which may include brand names, product charac-
teristics, warranties, and other features. Next, the buyer 
weighs the various alternatives he or she has discovered 
and then finally makes a choice and acquires the item. 
In the after-purchase stage, the consumer evaluates the 
suitability of the product. This judgment will affect 
future purchases. As Figure 12.4 shows, the buying 
process is influenced by situational factors (physical 
surroundings, social surroundings, time, purchase rea-
son, and buyer’s mood and condition), psychological 
factors (perception, motives, learning, attitudes, per-
sonality, and lifestyle), and social factors (family, roles, 
reference groups, online social networks, social class, 
culture, and subculture).
Consumer buying behavior is also affected by the 
ability to buy or one’s buying power, which is largely 
determined by income. As every taxpayer knows, not all 
income is available for spending. For this reason, mar-
keters consider income in three different ways. Personal 
income is the income an individual receives from all 
sources less the Social Security taxes the individual must 
pay. Disposable income is personal income less all 
additional personal taxes. These taxes include income, 
estate, gift, and property taxes levied by local, state, and 
federal governments. Historically, about 3 percent of 
disposable income in the United States is saved, but that 
percentage has gone up to about 4.5 percent of dispos-
able income in recent years.22 Discretionary income 
is disposable income less savings and expenditures on 
food, clothing, and housing. Discretionary income is of 
particular interest to marketers because consumers have 
the most choice in spending it. Consumers use their discretionary income to purchase 
items ranging from automobiles and vacations to movies and pet food.
Business Buying Behavior
Business buyers consider a product’s quality, its price, and the service provided by 
suppliers. Business buyers are usually better informed than consumers about products 
and generally buy in larger quantities. In a business, a committee or a group of people, 
rather than just one person, often decides on purchases. Committee members must 
consider the organization’s objectives, purchasing policies, resources, and personnel. 
Business buying occurs through description, inspection, sampling, or negotiation. 
Because business transactions can be more complicated and orders tend to be larger, 
information on buyers and sellers is important. Credit rating agency Experian recently 
announced a partnership with the online marketplace Fedbid®, which will provide 
business and government buyers with access to sellers’ and contractors’ credit histories 
so that they can make more informed decisions regarding their supply chains and smart 
purchasing. This partnership should help save business buyers money while reducing 
fraud and wasted spending.23
Recognizing a problem. Problem recognition is the first stage of 
the consumer buying decision process. This ad makes consumers 
aware of an environmental problem they might not have known 
they were contributing to. The ad then provides more information 
about the solution—which is to buy Scott Naturals bathroom 
tissue.

As the market for single-serve coffee heats up, Nespresso 
and its rivals are competing to start long-term customer 
relationships and profit from the lifetime value of each 
buyer’s purchases. Selling a coffeemaker is the first step 
in serving a customer who will buy compatible coffee cap-
sules for years to come. The Nespresso Club (now 10 mil-
lion members strong) is the company’s way of keeping 
these customers satisfied and loyal. Members can consult 
with coffee experts, request service for their machines, 
order capsules for express delivery, and get early word 
about new products.
Nespresso, like Green Mountain Coffee Roasters and 
others in the industry, has patented its machines and cap-
sules to protect against unauthorized copying. However, 
these patents will soon start to expire, which means the 
company must be ready with new and improved products 
to meet customers’ needs and maintain market share.
Questions
1.	 How do Nespresso’s coffeemakers and capsules pro-
vide short-term and long-term utility for customers?
2.	 Of the six forces in the marketing environment, which 
do you think have the most effect on Nespresso’s 
ability to start and continue long-term customer rela-
tionships?

Understand the meaning of marketing and 
the importance of management of customer 
relationships.
Marketing is an organizational function and a set of 
processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value 
to customers and for managing customer relationships in 
ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholders. 
Maintaining positive relationships with customers is crucial. 
Relationship marketing is establishing long-term, mutually 
satisfying buyer–seller relationships. Customer relationship 
management uses information about customers to create 
marketing strategies that develop and sustain desirable 
customer relationships. Managing customer relationships 
requires identifying patterns of buying behavior and focusing 
on the most profitable customers. Customer lifetime value 
is a combination of purchase frequency, average value of 
purchases, and brand-switching patterns over the entire span 
of a customer’s relationship with the company.
Explain how marketing adds value by creating 
several forms of utility.
Marketing adds value in the form of utility or the power of a 
product or service to satisfy a need. It creates place utility by 
making products available where customers want them, time 
utility by making products available when customers want 
them, and possession utility by transferring the ownership of 
products to buyers.
Trace the development of the marketing concept 
and understand how it is implemented.
From the Industrial Revolution until the early 20th century, 
businesspeople focused on the production of goods; from 
the 1920s to the 1950s, the emphasis moved to the selling of 
goods. During the 1950s, however, businesspeople recognized 
that their enterprises involved not only producing and selling 
products but also satisfying customers’ needs. They began 
to implement the marketing concept, a business philosophy 
that involves the entire organization in the dual processes of 
meeting the customers’ needs and achieving the organization’s 
goals.
Implementation of the marketing concept begins and 
ends with customers—first to determine what customers’ 
needs are and then to evaluate how well the firm is meeting 
these needs.
Understand what markets are and how they are 
classified.
A market consists of people with needs, the ability to buy, and 
the desire and authority to purchase. Markets are classified 
as consumer and industrial (producer, reseller, governmental, 
and institutional) markets.

Identify the four elements of the marketing mix 
and be aware of their importance in developing a 
marketing strategy.
A marketing strategy is a plan for the best use of an 
organization’s resources to meet its objectives. Developing 
a marketing strategy involves selecting and analyzing a 
target market and creating and maintaining a marketing 
mix that will satisfy the target market. A target market is 
chosen through either the undifferentiated approach or the 
market segmentation approach. A market segment is a group 
of individuals or organizations within a market that have 
similar characteristics and needs. Businesses that use an 
undifferentiated approach design a single marketing mix and 
direct it at the entire market for a particular product. The 
market segmentation approach directs a marketing mix at a 
segment of a market.
The four elements of a firm’s marketing mix are product, 
price, distribution, and promotion. The product ingredient 
includes decisions about the product’s design, brand name, 
packaging, and warranties. The pricing ingredient is con-
cerned with both base prices and various types of discounts. 
Distribution involves not only transportation and storage but 
also the selection of intermediaries. Promotion focuses on 
providing information to target markets. The elements of the 
marketing mix can be varied to suit broad organizational 
goals, marketing objectives, and target markets.
Explain how the marketing environment affects 
strategic market planning.
To achieve a firm’s marketing objectives, marketing-mix 
strategies must begin with an assessment of the marketing 
environment, which, in turn, will influence decisions 
about marketing-mix ingredients. Marketing activities are 
affected by a number of external forces that make up the 
marketing environment. These forces include economic 
forces, sociocultural forces, political forces, competitive 
forces, legal and regulatory forces, and technological forces. 
Economic forces affect customers’ ability and willingness to 
buy. Sociocultural forces are societal and cultural factors, 
such as attitudes, beliefs, and lifestyles, that affect customers’ 
buying choices. Political forces and legal and regulatory 
forces influence marketing planning through laws that 
protect consumers and regulate competition. Competitive 
forces are the actions of competitors who are implementing 
their own marketing plans. Technological forces can create 
new marketing opportunities or quickly cause a product to 
become obsolete.
Understand the major components of a 
marketing plan.
A marketing plan is a written document that specifies 
an organization’s resources, objectives, strategy, and 
implementation and control efforts to be used in marketing 
a specific product or product group. The marketing plan 
describes a firm’s current position, establishes marketing 
objectives, and specifies the methods the organization will 
use to achieve these objectives. Marketing plans can be short-
range plans, covering one year or less; medium-range plans, 
covering two to five years; or long-range plans, covering 
periods of more than five years.
Describe how market measurement and sales 
forecasting are used.
Market measurement and sales forecasting are used to 
estimate sales potential and predict product sales in specific 
market segments.
Distinguish between a marketing information 
system and marketing research.
Strategies are monitored and evaluated through marketing 
research and the marketing information system that stores 
and processes internal and external data in a form that 
aids marketing decision making. A marketing information 
system is a system for managing marketing information 
that is gathered continually from internal and external 
sources. Marketing research is the process of systematically 
gathering, recording, and analyzing data concerning 
a particular marketing problem. It is an intermittent 
rather than a continual source of marketing information. 
Technology is making information for marketing decisions 
more accessible. Electronic communication tools can be very 
useful for accumulating accurate information with minimal 
customer interaction. Information technologies that are 
changing the way marketers obtain and use information 
are databases, online information services, and the Internet. 
Some companies are using social media to obtain feedback 
from customers.
Identify the major steps in the consumer buying 
decision process and the sets of factors that may 
influence this process.
Buying behavior consists of the decisions and actions of people 
involved in buying and using products. Consumer buying 
behavior refers to the purchase of products for personal 
or household use. Organizational buying behavior is the 
purchase of products by producers, resellers, governments, 
and institutions. Understanding buying behavior helps 
marketers to predict how buyers will respond to marketing 
strategies. The consumer buying decision process consists 
of five steps, that is, recognizing the problem, searching 
for information, evaluating alternatives, purchasing, and 
evaluating after purchase. Factors affecting the consumer 
buying decision process fall into three categories: situational 
influences, psychological influences, and social influences.

PepsiCo, the world’s leading snack marketer, aims to gobble up 
more market share through careful targeting and creative mar-
keting. Most of PepsiCo’s sales come from North and South 
America, where it has traditionally been a strong competitor. 
Among its ever-expanding pantry of brands, 19 are already 
billion-dollar businesses, including Pepsi-Cola, Diet Pepsi, and 
Mountain Dew soft drinks; Lay’s, Doritos, and Tostitos chips; 
Lipton teas; Tropicana fruit drinks; Gatorade sports drinks; 
Quaker foods; and Aquafina bottled waters.
The company faces aggressive competition from Coca-Cola 
and Draft Foods, both of which are making marketing waves in 
the Americas, across Europe, and in Asia. It must also deal with 
a variety of local brands that, in some cases, have large and loyal 
customer bases. Therefore, PepsiCo’s marketers constantly research 
customers’ needs and study the influence of environmental forces so 
that they can develop the right marketing mix for the right market.
One global trend that PepsiCo’s marketers have identified is 
increased interest in healthier eating. Several years ago, the U.K. 
government mounted a campaign warning consumers of the 
dangers of high salt intake and urged them to change their diets. 
In response, PepsiCo slashed the amount of sodium in its locally 
popular Walkers snacks by 25 percent. With U.S. health experts 
also calling for lower salt in processed foods, PepsiCo is now 
reducing the level of salt in many other snacks worldwide. It is 
also lightening up on fats and sugar and making nutrition labeling 
more prominent so that consumers can make educated choices. 
“What we want to do with our ‘fun for you’ products is to make 
them the healthiest ‘fun for you’ products,” says the CEO.
Another trend that PepsiCo’s marketers noticed is sharply 
higher use of digital media among teenagers and young adults, 
a large and lucrative target market for snacks and beverages. As 
a result, PepsiCo has stepped up its use of the Internet, blogs, 
Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to communicate with and influ-
ence these consumers. Its Dewmocracy campaigns, for example, 
invite customers to vote online for their favorite new Mountain 
Dew flavors. It has also run contests asking customers to create 
and submit homemade television commercials for Doritos chips. 
After posting the finalists online for public viewing and voting, 
PepsiCo airs the winning advertisements during the Super Bowl, 
giving winners cash prizes and their 30 seconds of fame.
PepsiCo’s recent Refresh Project, one of its more unusual mar-
keting efforts, combined digital marketing with social responsibility.

PepsiCo Tailors Tastes to Tantalize 
Tastebuds of Target Markets

pre-auto era, its bicycles became a two-wheeled status symbol 
for British consumers, and the brand maintained its cachet for 
decades. Although Raleigh’s chopper-style bicycles were hugely 
popular in the 1970s, international competition and changing 
consumer tastes have taken a toll during the past few decades.
Now Raleigh markets a wide variety of bicycles to consum-
ers in Europe, Canada, and the United States. Its U.S. division, 
based in Kent, Washington, has been researching new bicycles for 
contemporary consumers and developing models that are lighter, 
faster, and better. Inspired by the European lifestyle and tradition 
of getting around on bicycles, and its long history in the business, 
Raleigh is looking to reinvigorate sales and capture a larger share 
of the $6 billion U.S. bicycle market.
Raleigh’s U.S. marketers have been observing the “messenger 
market,” customers who ride bicycles through downtown streets 
to deliver documents and small packages to businesses and indi-
viduals. They have also noted that many everyday bicycle riders 
dress casually, in T-shirts and jeans, rather than in special racing 
outfits designed for speed. Targeting consumers who enjoy rid-
ing bicycles as a lifestyle, Raleigh’s marketers are focusing on this 
segment’s specific needs and preferences as they develop, price, 
promote, and distribute new models.
In recent years, Raleigh’s marketers have stepped up the 
practice of bringing demonstration fleets to public places where 
potential buyers can hop on one of the company’s bicycles and 
pedal for a few minutes. The idea is to allow consumers who 
enjoy bicycling to actually experience the fun feeling of riding a 
Raleigh. The marketers are also fanning out to visit bicycle races 
and meet bicyclists in cities and towns across America, encourag-
ing discussions about Raleigh and about bicycling in general and 
seeking feedback about particular Raleigh products.
Listening to consumers, Raleigh’s marketers recognized 
that many had misperceptions about the weight of steel-frame 
bicycles. Although steel can be quite heavy, Raleigh’s bicycles are 
solid yet light, nimble, and easy to steer. Those who have been on 
bicycles with steel frames praise the quality of the ride, saying that 
steel “has a soul,” according to market research.
To stay in touch with its target market, Raleigh is increasingly 
active in social media. It has several thousand fans who visit its 
Facebook page to see the latest product concepts and post their 
own photos and comments about Raleigh bicycles. It also uses 
Twitter to keep customers informed and answer questions about 
its bicycles and upcoming demonstration events. The company’s 
main blog communicates the latest news about everything from 
frame design and new bike colors under consideration to prod-
uct awards and racing activities. It has a separate blog about 
both the fun and the challenges of commuting on bicycle, a topic 
in which its customers are intensely interested because so many 
do exactly that. By listening to customers and showing that it 
understands the daily life of its target market, Raleigh is wheeling 
toward higher sales in a highly competitive marketplace.24
Questions for Discussion
1.	 Is Raleigh using the marketing concept? Explain.
2.	 What type of approach does Raleigh use to select target mar-
kets?
3.	 Of the four categories of segmentation variables, which is 
most important to Raleigh’s segmentation strategy, and why?

Building customer relationships through  
effective marketing
Comcast, the cable and communications provider, was one of 
the first companies to use Twitter for customer service. Frank 
Eliason was the first director of digital care and the first to 
develop ComcastCares on Twitter. Essentially the Comcast team 
scans Twitter for people complaining about service and then 
contacts them to see if they can help. This has changed the 
entire culture of the organization, as well as prompted other 
companies to use Twitter for customer service. Visit the site at 
Comcastcares on Twitter (do a search in a search engine like 
Bing or Google).
1.	 After reviewing Comcastcares on Twitter, do you think that 
this helps with customer service? Why or why not?
2.	 Do you see other applications for Twitter for a communica-
tions giant like Comcast?
2 	JOURNALING FOR SUCCESS
Discovery statement: This chapter emphasized the importance of 
keeping the customer at the core of every marketing decision.
Assignment
1.	 Think about the businesses from which you have purchased 
goods or services. Select the organization that you believe has 
adopted the marketing concept. Discuss the reasons why you 
believe that this company has adopted the marketing concept.
2.	 Describe the marketing mix this company has created for the 
brand that you purchase from this company.
3.	 Which two companies are the strongest competitors of this 
organization? Explain why.
4.	 Besides competition, which environmental forces have the 
greatest impact on this company for which you are a customer?
5.	 Calculate your customer lifetime value to this company. After 
recording your customer lifetime value, describe how you cal-
culated it.
3 	DEVELOPING CRITICAL-THINKING SKILLS
Market segmentation is the process of breaking down a larger target 
market into smaller segments. One common base of market seg-
mentation is demographics. Demographics for the consumer mar-
ket, which consists of individuals and household members who buy 
goods for their own use, include criteria such as age, gender, race, 
religion, income, family size, occupation, education, social class, 
and marital status. Liz Claiborne, Inc., retailer of women’s apparel, 
uses demographics to target a market it calls Liz Lady. The company 
knows Liz Lady’s age, income range, professional status, and family 
status, and it uses this profile to make marketing decisions.
Assignment
1.	 Identify a company that markets to the consumer.
2.	 Identify the company’s major product.
3.	 Determine the demographics of one of the company’s ­markets.
a.	 From the list that follows, choose the demographics that 
apply to this market. (Remember that the demographics 
chosen must relate to the interest, need, and ability of the 
customer to purchase the product.)
b.	 Briefly describe each demographic characteristic.

During the year-long program, PepsiCo invited consumers to apply 
online for grants to make a difference in their community. Every 
month, the public voted on which grants they thought were most 
deserving of funding. In all, PepsiCo awarded nearly $20 million in 
grants, got tens of thousands of customers interested in the project, 
and earned positive publicity for its good works. Of course, PepsiCo 
hoped that customers would also notice and respond to its social 
responsibility when they were making buying decisions about snacks 
and beverages.
These days, PepsiCo is keeping up a steady stream of new 
product introductions, based on marketing research that helps 
it understand the preferences of customers in each country. For 
example, catering to Russian palates, it offers Lay’s chips fla-
vored with red caviar. In China, its Cao Ben Le drinks feature 
herb flavors that local customers favor. In Japan, knowing that 
its customers look forward to seasonal variety, the company has 
launched a series of limited-edition soft drinks such as Pepsi 
Baobab (with the tang of African fruit flavor). In India, it markets 
Nimbooz by 7Up, its unique twist on a traditional lemon drink. 
What will PepsiCo do next in its quest to satisfy its global cus-
tomer base?25
Questions

4.	 Summarize your findings in a statement that describes the tar-
get market for the company’s product.
4 	BUILDING TEAM SKILLS
Review the text definitions of market and target market. Markets 
can be classified as consumer or industrial. Buyer behavior con-
sists of the decisions and actions of those involved in buying and 
using products or services. By examining aspects of a company’s 
products, you usually can determine the company’s target mar-
ket and the characteristics important to members of that target 
­market.
Assignment
1.	 Working in teams of three to five, identify a company and its 
major products.
2.	 List and discuss characteristics that customers may find 
important. These factors may include price, quality, brand 
name, variety of services, salespeople, customer service, spe-
cial offers, promotional campaign, packaging, convenience 
of use, convenience of purchase, location, guarantees, store/
office decor, and payment terms.
3.	 Write a description of the company’s primary customer (tar-
get market).
5 	RESEARCHING DIFFERENT CAREERS
Before interviewing for a job, you should learn all you can about 
the company. With this information, you will be prepared to ask 
meaningful questions about the firm during the interview, and the 
interviewer no doubt will be impressed with your knowledge of 
the business and your interest in it. To find out about a company, 
you can conduct some market research.
Assignment
1.	 Choose at least two local companies for which you might like 
to work.
2.	 Contact your local Chamber of Commerce. (The Chamber of 
Commerce collects information about local businesses, and 
most of its services are free.) Ask for information about the 
companies.
3.	 Call the Better Business Bureau in your community and ask if 
there are any complaints against the companies.
4.	 Prepare a report summarizing your findings.

PepsiCo’s Pantry of Billion-Dollar Brands
From Cheetos and Doritos to Aquafina and Gatorade, PepsiCo’s pantry is bulging with 
billion-dollar brands as the snack and beverage company launches innovative new products 
and sets prices for products purchased in different places. With $30 billion in annual sales, 
PepsiCo increasingly plans joint promotions of two or more brands because “consumers 
think about our beverage and snack brands together,” says a senior executive. For example, 
the company targets young men with convenience-store displays featuring Hot Doritos 
chips and Pepsi Max cola and reaches out to baseball fans with “Double Play” promotions 
starring Lay’s chips and specific Pepsi colas.
PepsiCo has a nonstop schedule for launching new products. Targeting customers 
who crave bold new flavors, its Frito-Lay division has created smokier, spicier versions of 
Doritos and Tostitos chips, among other snacks. Meanwhile, its Tropicana business has 
been developing good-tasting, good-for-you juice blends. The Trop50 product line consists 
of premium fruit-juice blends with Stevia, a natural sweetener, to reduce the sugar and 
calorie content. Every few months, Tropicana adds a new flavor, such as red orange or 
peach with white tea, to provide more variety and please buyers’ taste buds. Since Trop50 
first landed on store shelves in 2009, sales have skyrocketed by as much as 50 percent every 
year, giving PepsiCo a major new product success. Just as important, these unique blends 
help PepsiCo compete with Coca-Cola’s Minute Maid and Simply Orange premium juices.
The company’s knowledge of consumer behavior is especially vital for price setting. 
PepsiCo offers 99-cent soft drinks in grab-and-go bottle sizes for customers who stop into 
convenience stores and gas stations. It also offers 99-cent 1.5 liter bottles for mealtimes 
in small households and volume-priced 20-packs of 12-ounce cans for parties and other 
occasions. And customers who want a smaller size pay a little more per ounce for PepsiCo’s 
7.5-ounce cans. Meanwhile, PepsiCo has to pay more for sugar and some other ingredi-
ents, but it can’t always pass these higher costs along in the form of higher prices because 
of competition, customer resistance, and economic conditions. Looking ahead, how will 
the company manage its profits as it puts new products into its pantry?1
A 
product, like  a Diet Pepsi, is everything one receives in an exchange, includ-
ing all tangible and intangible attributes and expected benefits. An Apple iPod 
purchase, for example, includes not only the iPod itself but also earbuds, a 
power adapter, instructions, and a warranty. A new car includes a warranty, an owner’s 
manual, and perhaps free emergency road service for a year. Some of the intangibles 
that may go with an automobile include the status associated with ownership and the 
memories generated from past rides. Developing and managing products effectively are 
crucial to an organization’s ability to maintain successful marketing mixes.
A product may be a good, a service, or an idea. A good is a real, physical thing that 
we can touch, such as a Dell laptop computer. A service is the result of applying human 
or mechanical effort to a person or thing. Basically, a service is a change we pay others 
to make for us. A real estate agent’s services result in a change in the ownership of real 
property. A barber’s services result in a change in your appearance. An idea may take 
the form of philosophies, lessons, concepts, or advice. Often ideas are included with a 
good or service. Thus, we might buy a book (a good) that provides ideas on how to lose 
weight. Alternatively, we might join Weight Watchers for ideas on how to lose weight 
and for help (services) in doing so.
FYI
Did You Know? 
Fritos, Tropicana, and Mountain 
Dew are among the 22 
brands in PepsiCo’s pantry 
that each ring up more than 
$1 billion in annual sales.

Chapter 13   Creating and Pricing Products That Satisfy Customers	
359
We look at products first in this chapter. We examine product classifications and 
describe the four stages, or life-cycles, through which every product moves. Next, we 
illustrate how firms manage products effectively by modifying or deleting existing 
products and by developing new products. We also discuss branding, packaging, and 
labeling of products. Then our focus shifts to pricing. We explain competitive factors 
that influence sellers’ pricing decisions and also explore buyers’ perceptions of prices. 
After considering organizational objectives that can be accomplished through pricing, 
we outline several methods for setting prices. Finally, we describe pricing strategies by 
which sellers can reach target markets successfully.
Classification of Products
Different classes of products are directed at particular target markets. A product’s 
classification largely determines what kinds of distribution, promotion, and pricing are 
appropriate in marketing the product.
Products can be grouped into two general categories: consumer and business (the 
latter are also called business-to-business or industrial products). A product purchased 
to satisfy personal and family needs is a consumer product. A product bought for 
resale, for making other products, or for use in a firm’s operations is a business 
product. The buyer’s use of the product determines the classification of an item. Note 
that a single item can be both a consumer and a business product. Light bulbs are a 
consumer product when you use them in your home, but the same light bulbs are a 
business product if you purchase them for use in a business.
Consumer Product Classifications
The traditional and most widely accepted system of classifying consumer products 
consists of three categories: convenience, shopping, and specialty products. These 
groupings are based primarily on characteristics of buyers’ purchasing behavior.
A convenience product is a relatively inexpensive, frequently purchased item for 
which buyers want to exert only minimal effort. Examples include bread, gasoline, 
newspapers, soft drinks, and chewing gum. The buyer spends little time in planning the 
purchase of a convenience item or in comparing available brands or sellers.
A shopping product is an item for which buyers are willing to expend con-
siderable effort on planning and making the purchase. Buyers allocate ample time 
for comparing stores and brands with respect to prices, product features, quali-
ties, services, and perhaps warranties. Appliances, upholstered furniture, men’s suits, 
bicycles, and mobile phones are examples of shopping products. These products are 
expected to last for a fairly long time and thus are purchased less frequently than 
convenience items.
A specialty product possesses one or more unique characteristics for which a 
group of buyers is willing to expend considerable purchasing effort. Buyers actually 
plan the purchase of a specialty product; they know exactly what they want and will 
not accept a substitute. While searching for specialty products, purchasers do not com-
pare alternatives. Examples include unique sports cars, a specific type of antique dining 
table, a rare imported beer, or perhaps special handcrafted stereo speakers.
Business Product Classifications
Based on their characteristics and intended uses, business products can be classified 
into the following categories: raw materials, major equipment, accessory equipment, 
component parts, process materials, supplies, and services.
A raw material is a basic material that actually becomes part of a physical prod-
uct. It usually comes from mines, forests, oceans, or recycled solid wastes. Raw materi-
als are usually bought and sold according to grades and specifications.
Major equipment includes large tools and machines used for production purposes. 
Examples of major equipment are lathes, cranes, and stamping machines. Some major

equipment is custom-made for a particular organization, but other items are standard-
ized products that perform one or several tasks for many types of organizations.
Accessory equipment is standardized equipment used in a firm’s production or 
office activities. Examples include hand tools, fax machines, fractional horsepower 
motors, and calculators. Compared with major equipment, accessory items are usually 
much less expensive and are purchased routinely with less negotiation.
A component part becomes part of a physical product and is either a finished 
item ready for assembly or a product that needs little processing before assembly. 
Although it becomes part of a larger product, a component part can often be identified 
easily. Clocks, tires, computer chips, and switches are examples of component parts.
A process material is used directly in the production of another product. Unlike 
a component part, however, a process material is not readily identifiable in the finished 
product. Like component parts, process materials are purchased according to industry 
standards or to the specifications of the individual purchaser. Examples include indus-
trial glue and food preservatives.
A supply facilitates production and operations but does not become part of a fin-
ished product. Paper, pencils, oils, and cleaning agents are examples.
A business service is an intangible product that an organization uses in its opera-
tions. Examples include financial, legal, online, janitorial, and marketing research ser-
vices. Purchasers must decide whether to provide their own services internally or to 
hire them from outside the organization.
The Product Life-Cycle
In a way, products are like people. They are born, they live, and they die. Every product 
progresses through a product life-cycle, a series of stages in which a product’s sales 
revenue and profit increase, reach a peak, and then decline. A firm must be able 
to launch, modify, and delete products from its offering of products in response 
to changes in product life-cycles. Otherwise, the firm’s profits will disappear, and

the firm will fail. Depending on the product, life-cycle stages will vary in length. In 
this section, we discuss the stages of the life-cycle and how marketers can use this 
information.
Stages of the Product Life-Cycle
Generally, the product life-cycle is assumed to be composed of four stages— 
introduction, growth, maturity, and decline—as shown in Figure 13.1. Some products 
progress through these stages rapidly, in a few weeks or months. Others may take years 
to go through each stage. The Rubik’s Cube had a relatively short life-cycle. In contrast, 
Parker Brothers’ Monopoly game, which was introduced nearly a century ago, is still 
going strong.
Introduction  In the introduction stage, customer awareness and acceptance of the 
product are low. Sales rise gradually as a result of promotion and distribution activi-
ties; initially, however, high development and marketing costs result in low profit or 
even in a loss. There are no competitors. The price is sometimes high, and purchasers 
are primarily people who want to be “the first” to own the new product. The market-
ing challenge at this stage is to make potential customers aware of the product’s exis-
tence and its features, benefits, and uses.
A new product is seldom an immediate success. Marketers must watch early buy-
ing patterns carefully and be prepared to modify the new product promptly if neces-
sary. The product should be priced to attract the particular market segment that has 
the greatest desire and ability to buy the product. Plans for distribution and promotion 
should suit the targeted market segment. As with the product itself, the initial price, 
distribution channels, and promotional efforts may need to be adjusted quickly to 
maintain sales growth during the introduction stage.
Growth  In the growth stage, sales increase rapidly as the product becomes well 
known. Other firms have probably begun to market competing products. The compe-
tition and lower unit costs (owing to mass production) result in a lower price, which 
reduces the profit per unit. Note that industry profits reach a peak and begin to decline 
during this stage. To meet the needs of the growing market, the originating firm offers 
modified versions of its product and expands its distribution.

Part 5   Marketing
Management’s goal in the growth stage is to stabi-
lize and strengthen the product’s position by encourag-
ing brand loyalty. To beat the competition, the company 
may further improve the product or expand the product 
line to appeal to additional market segments. Apple, for 
example, has introduced several variations of its wildly 
popular iPod MP3 player. The iPod Shuffle is the small-
est and most affordable version, whereas the iPod Nano 
offers song, photo, and video support in a thin, light-
weight version that has a built-in video camera. The iPod 
Classic provides up to 160 GB of hard drive space, the most of 
any of the versions. The iPod Touch has a large, vibrant touch 
screen and an additional Wi-Fi connection that can use GPS 
technology and download applications. Apple has expanded its 
iTunes Music Store to include downloadable versions of popu-
lar TV shows (to be purchased per episode or as an entire sea-
son), exclusive music video downloads, and movies that can be 
purchased or rented online. Apple greatly expanded its product 
mix with the release of the iPhone, a combination iPod Touch 
and mobile phone. Continuous product innovation and service 
expansion have helped to expand Apple’s market penetration 
in the competitive MP3 player market.2
Management also may compete by lowering prices if 
increased production efficiency has resulted in savings for the 
company. As the product becomes more widely accepted, mar-
keters may be able to broaden the network of distributors. 
Marketers can also emphasize customer service and prompt 
credit for defective products. During this period, promotional 
efforts attempt to build brand loyalty among customers.
Maturity  Sales are still increasing at the beginning of the 
maturity stage, but the rate of increase has slowed. Later in this stage, the sales 
curve peaks and begins to decline. Industry profits decline throughout this stage. 
Product lines are simplified, markets are segmented more carefully, and price com-
petition increases. The increased competition forces weaker competitors to leave 
the industry. Refinements and extensions of the original product continue to appear 
on the market.
During a product’s maturity stage, its market share may be strengthened by 
redesigned packaging or style changes. Barq’s root beer, a popular soda for more 
than a century, recently unveiled a package redesign and new slogan that pay 
homage to its Gulf Coast roots. The bottles and cans sport a diamond design 
reminiscent of the beverage’s original 1898 glass bottles (which are still avail-
able in the Gulf Coast area) and the new slogan reads “It’s good. Since 1898.” 
The company hopes to capitalize on customers’ feelings of solidarity with the 
Gulf region after the catastrophic BP oil spill, while attracting new attention to 
the mature brand.3 In addition, consumers may be encouraged to use the prod-
uct more often or in new ways. Pricing strategies are flexible during this stage. 
Markdowns and price incentives are not uncommon, although price increases 
may work to offset production and distribution costs. Marketers may offer incen-
tives and assistance of various kinds to dealers to encourage them to support 
mature products, especially in the face of competition from private-label brands. 
New promotional efforts and aggressive personal selling may be necessary during 
this period of intense competition.

tinue to fall. The number of competing firms declines, and the only survivors in

the marketplace are firms that specialize in marketing the product. 
Production and marketing costs become the most important determi-
nant of profit.
When a product adds to the success of the overall product line, 
the company may retain it; otherwise, management must determine 
when to eliminate the product. A product usually declines because of 
technological advances or environmental factors or because consum-
ers have switched to competing brands. Therefore, few changes are 
made in the product itself during this stage. Instead, management 
may raise the price to cover costs, reprice to maintain market share, 
or lower the price to reduce inventory. Similarly, management will 
narrow distribution of the declining product to the most profitable 
existing markets. During this period, the company probably will not 
spend heavily on promotion, although it may use some advertis-
ing and sales incentives to slow the product’s decline. The company 
may choose to eliminate less-profitable versions of the product from 
the product line or may decide to drop the product entirely. Google 
actively discontinues products. Last year, Google discontinued ten 
products that failed to take off, including Google Desktop, Aardvark, 
and Google Pack. Some of these products were dropped immediately 
and some were phased out.4
Using the Product Life-Cycle
Marketers should be aware of the life-cycle stage of each product for which they are 
responsible. Moreover, they should try to estimate how long the product is expected to 
remain in that stage. Both must be taken into account in making decisions about the 
marketing strategy for a product. If a product is expected to remain in the maturity 
stage for a long time, a replacement product might be introduced later in the maturity 
stage. If the maturity stage is expected to be short, however, a new product should 
be introduced much earlier. In some cases, a firm may be willing to take the chance 
of speeding up the decline of existing products. In other situations, a company will 
attempt to extend a product’s life-cycle. Extending its life can be an importance tool 
in maintaining a product’s profitability. Developed over 150 years ago, Kraft has 
extended the life of Jell-O through frequently developing new flavors, uses, and recipes, 
including seasonal desserts and even baked goods.5
Product Line and Product Mix
A product line is a group of similar products that differ only in relatively minor 
characteristics. Generally, the products within a product line are related to each other in the 
way they are produced, marketed, or used. Procter & Gamble, for example, manufactures 
and markets several shampoos, including Prell, Head & Shoulders, and Ivory.
Many organizations tend to introduce new products within existing product lines. 
This permits them to apply the experience and knowledge they have acquired to the 
production and marketing of new products. Other firms develop entirely new product 
lines.
An organization’s product mix consists of all the products the firm offers for 
sale. For example, Procter & Gamble, which acquired Gillette, has over 85 brands 
that fall into one of two product line categories: beauty and grooming and household 
care.6 Two “dimensions” are often applied to a firm’s product mix. The width of the 
mix is the number of product lines it contains. The depth of the mix is the average 
number of individual products within each line. These are general measures; we 
speak of a broad or a narrow mix rather than a mix of exactly three or five product 
lines. Some organizations provide broad product mixes in order to be competitive.
Define product line and 
product mix and distinguish 
between the two.

How companies use product lines to

they develop producing one product line to 
develop others. It’s much a like a tree in a forest 
that grows new branches to find sunlight and 
thrive. This photo shows only a few of Kellogg 
Company’s 20 different cereal brands. Cereals 
aren’t Kellogg’s only product line, though. The 
company also produces a wide variety of crackers, 
bars, beverages, toaster pastries, waffles, 
pancakes, syrups, and fruit-flavored snacks.

Part 5   Marketing
Managing the Product Mix
To provide products that satisfy people in a firm’s target market or markets and that also 
achieve the organization’s objectives, a marketer must develop, adjust, and maintain an 
effective product mix. Seldom can the same product mix be effective for long. Because 
customers’ product preferences and attitudes change, their desire for a product may diminish 
or grow. In some cases, a firm needs to alter its product mix to adapt to competition. A 
marketer may have to eliminate a product from the mix because one or more competitors 
dominate that product’s specific market segment. Similarly, an organization may have 
to introduce a new product or modify an existing one to compete more effectively. A 
marketer may also expand the firm’s product mix to take advantage of excess marketing 
and production capacity. For example, General Mills has a wide product mix consisting 
of many different brands. It frequently expands its product mix by adding new offerings 
to its different product lines, such as breakfast cereals. The breakfast cereals product line 
consists of different familiar brands, such as Fiber One, Cascadian Farms, and Wheaties. 
General Mills takes advantage of production capacity for the Cheerios line by increasing 
its depth with new flavors, such as peanut butter, chocolate, and dulce de leche.7 For 
whatever reason a product mix is altered, the product mix must be managed to bring about 
improvements in the mix. There are three major ways to improve a product mix: change 
an existing product, delete a product, or develop a new product.
Managing Existing Products
A product mix can be changed by deriving additional products from existing ones. This 
can be accomplished through product modifications and by line extensions.
Product Modifications  Product modification refers to changing one or more of a 
product’s characteristics. For this approach to be effective, several conditions must be met. 
First, the product must be modifiable. Second, existing customers must be able to perceive 
that a modification has been made, assuming that the modified item is still directed at the 
same target market. Third, the modification should make the product more consistent with 
customers’ desires so that it provides greater satisfaction. For example, General Motors 
upgraded the structure and cooling systems in the battery for its Chevrolet Volt hybrid car 
in order to address some consumer hesitations over the battery’s safety. Volt owners were 
encouraged to bring their vehicles to a dealership to receive the new modified battery. In 
order to publicize the improvement, GM made widespread announcements regarding the 
change, including on the National Highway Safety Administration Web site.8
Existing products can be altered in three primary ways: in quality, function, and 
aesthetics. Quality modifications are changes that relate to a product’s dependabil-
ity and durability and are usually achieved by alterations in the materials or pro-
duction process. Functional modifications affect a product’s versatility, effectiveness, 
convenience, or safety; they usually require redesign of the product. Typical product 
categories that have undergone extensive functional modifications include home appli-
ances, office and farm equipment, and consumer electronics. Aesthetic modifications 
are directed at changing the sensory appeal of a product by altering its taste, texture, 
sound, smell, or visual characteristics. Because a buyer’s purchasing decision is affected 
by how a product looks, smells, tastes, feels, or sounds, an aesthetic modification may 
have a definite impact on purchases. Through aesthetic modifications, a firm can dif-
ferentiate its product from competing brands and perhaps gain a sizable market share 
if customers find the modified product more appealing.
Line Extensions  A line extension is the development of a product closely related 
to one or more products in the existing product line but designed specifically to meet 
somewhat different customer needs. WD-40, maker of the multi-use lubricant, recently 
launched its first-ever line extension. The WD-40 Specialist line consists of five differ-
ent products for industrial and home use, including a rust remover and a waterproofer.9

365
product deletion  the elimination 
of one or more products from a 
product line
Many of the so-called new products introduced each year are 
in fact line extensions. Line extensions are more common than new 
products because they are a less-expensive, lower-risk alternative 
for increasing sales. A line extension may focus on a different mar-
ket segment or be an attempt to increase sales within the same 
market segment by more precisely satisfying the needs of people in 
that segment. Line extensions are also used to take market share 
from competitors.
Deleting Products
To maintain an effective product mix, an organization often has to 
eliminate some products. This is called product deletion. A weak 
product costs a company time, money, and resources that could be 
used to modify other products or develop new ones. In addition, when 
a weak product generates an unfavorable image among customers, 
the negative image may rub off on other products sold by the firm.
Most organizations find it difficult to delete a product. Some 
firms drop weak products only after they have become severe finan-
cial burdens. A better approach is to conduct some form of system-
atic review of the product’s impact on the overall effectiveness of a 
firm’s product mix. Such a review should analyze a product’s contri-
bution to a company’s sales for a given period. It should include esti-
mates of future sales, costs, and profits associated with the product and a consideration 
of whether changes in the marketing strategy could improve the product’s performance.
A product-deletion program can definitely improve a firm’s performance. For 
example, T-Mobile recently decided to delete the Sidekick 4G smartphone due to 
declining sales and customer interest. However, the company announced that it had no 
plans to discontinue the entire Sidekick line.10
Developing New Products
Developing and introducing new products is frequently time consuming, expensive, 
and risky. Thousands of new products are introduced annually. The overall failure rate 
for new products is around 50 percent, although the failure rate in some industries can 
be much higher.11 Although developing new products is risky, failing to introduce new 
products can be just as hazardous. Successful new products bring a number of benefits 
to an organization, including survival, profits, a sustainable competitive advantage, 
and a favorable public image. Consider the numerous ways that the producers of the 
products in Table 13.1 have benefited.

Part 5   Marketing
New products are generally grouped into three categories on the 
basis of their degree of similarity to existing products. Imitations are 
products designed to be similar to—and to compete with—existing 
products of other firms. Examples are the various brands of whiten-
ing toothpastes that were developed to compete with those offered 
by Rembrandt. Adaptations are variations of existing products that 
are intended for an established market. Product refinements and 
extensions are the adaptations considered most often, although imi-
tative products may also include some refinement and extension. 
Innovations are entirely new products. They may give rise to a new 
industry or revolutionize an existing one. The introduction of digi-
tal music, for example, has brought major changes to the record-
ing industry. Innovative products take considerable time, effort, and 
money to develop. They are therefore less common than adaptations 
and imitations. Google recently announced an innovative new prod-
uct dubbed Project Glass. It involves a futuristic and ambitious plan 
to merge online technology with spectacles that users wear. Once 
finalized, the product will perform the function of many common 
electronic items. The product will act as a smartphone, day plan-
ner, navigation system, and even camera—all in wearable glasses 
with information showing up as small icons on the lenses. Because 
this product idea is so new, it has been the target of considerable 
consumer scrutiny, although many technophiles and early adopters 
are excited by the possibilities such a product can offer.12 As shown 
in Figure 13.2, the process of developing a new product consists of 
seven phases.

ideas that will help a firm to achieve its objectives. Although some 
organizations get their ideas almost by chance, firms trying to

Yak to the Future: From the Himalayas to the World
Entrepreneurial
Success

Julian Wilson and Aaron Pattillo, the 
cofounders of Khunu, market high-quality 
sweaters made of an unusual material: fine 
wool from yaks raised by Himalayan herders. The 
entrepreneurs met while on a mountain-biking tour outside 
Beijing and quickly discovered a shared interest in expanding 
economic opportunities for Himalayan herders. They noticed 
herders making coarse yak fiber into ropes, while the softer yak 
wool blew away. Wilson and Pattillo reasoned that if yak wool 
keeps animals warm high in the Himalayas, it would be good 
for cold-weather clothing.
As pioneers of yak-wool clothing, the entrepreneurs had 
to educate retailers and consumers about their products’ 
benefits while dispelling the misperception that yak wool is 
stiff and heavy. They also had to explain that their products 
carry premium prices because of the high quality and the fair-
market cost of raw yak wool bought from nomadic herders. 
For its associations with the area’s ancient Mongolian tribes, 
they chose Khunu as their brand name.
Wilson and Pattillo are currently riding the wave of two 
trends: using natural materials and ethical sourcing of raw 
materials. Yak wool is still a novelty, but not for long, says 
Wilson: “Global fashion brands are always on the lookout for 
new fibers, and they’re the ones most likely to take yak hair 
into the mainstream.”

maximize product-mix effectiveness usually develop systematic approaches for gen-
erating new-product ideas. Ideas may come from managers, researchers, engineers, 
competitors, advertising agencies, management consultants, private research organi-
zations, customers, salespersons, or top executives. Sometimes, large firms with supe-
rior experience and resources may mentor small firms and help them generate ideas 
to help their businesses grow. Business incubators sprung up around the country that 
pair new small businesses with large established ones so that the new business can 
learn about marketing and branding from experts at established firms. Cincinnati-
based Brandery is one such incubator. It pairs tech start-ups with marketers from 
firms like Procter & Gamble or with major branding agencies. The entrepreneurs can 
get ideas, help hone their image, and improve marketing strategy.13
Screening  During screening, ideas that do not match organizational resources and 
objectives are rejected. In this phase, a firm’s managers consider whether the organiza-
tion has personnel with the expertise to develop and market the proposed product. 
Generally, marketers follow these seven steps to develop a new product.

Part 5   Marketing
Management may reject a good idea because the company lacks the necessary skills 
and abilities. The largest number of product ideas are rejected during the screening 
phase.
Concept Testing  Concept testing is a phase in which a product idea is presented to 
a small sample of potential buyers through a written or oral description (and perhaps 
a few drawings) to determine their attitudes and initial buying intentions regarding the 
product. For a single product idea, an organization can test one or several concepts of 
the same product. Concept testing is a low-cost means for an organization to determine 
consumers’ initial reactions to a product idea before investing considerable resources 
in product research and development (R&D). Product development personnel can use 
the results of concept testing to improve product attributes and product benefits that 
are most important to potential customers. The types of questions asked vary consid-
erably depending on the type of product idea being tested. The following are typical 
questions:
●
●Which benefits of the proposed product are especially attractive to you?
●
●Which features are of little or no interest to you?
●
●What are the primary advantages of the proposed product over the one you cur-
rently use?
●
●If this product were available at an appropriate price, how often would you buy it?
●
●How could this proposed product be improved?
Business Analysis  Business analysis provides tentative ideas about a potential prod-
uct’s financial performance, including its probable profitability. During this stage, the 
firm considers how the new product, if it were introduced, would affect the firm’s sales, 
costs, and profits. Marketing personnel usually work up preliminary sales and cost 
projections at this point, with the help of R&D and production managers.
Product Development  In the product development phase, the company must find 
out first if it is technically feasible to produce the product and then if the product can 
be made at costs low enough to justify a reasonable price. If a product idea makes it to 
this point, it is transformed into a working model, or prototype. For example, Aptera, 
a California-based vehicle manufacturer, recently developed a prototype electric vehicle 
called the 2e. The 2e is an innovative three-wheeled, two-seat vehicle that uses an elec-
tric motor with phosphate-based lithium-ion batteries. The 2e is expected to operate 
at about 200 MPG and travel about 100 miles on a single charge.14 Often, this step is 
time-consuming and expensive for the organization. If a product successfully moves 
through this step, then it is ready for test marketing.
Test Marketing  Test marketing is the limited introduction of a product in several 
towns or cities chosen to be representative of the intended target market. Its aim is 
to determine buyers’ probable reactions. The product is left in the test markets long 
enough to give buyers a chance to repurchase the product if they are so inclined. 
Marketers can experiment with advertising, pricing, and packaging in different test 
areas and can measure the extent of brand awareness, brand switching, and repeat 
purchases that result from alterations in the marketing mix. Columbus, Ohio, is a very 
popular test marketing location because its demographics are representative of the 
nation as a whole. When Wendy’s wanted to test market its new Black Label Burger, it 
turned to Columbus first. Likewise, Jeni’s Ice Cream tested its cayenne pepper–flavored 
ice cream in Columbus and found it was a big hit.15
Commercialization  During commercialization, plans for full-scale manufacturing 
and marketing must be refined and completed, and budgets for the project must be 
prepared. In the early part of the commercialization phase, marketing management 
analyzes the results of test marketing to find out what changes in the marketing mix

are needed before the product is introduced. The results of test marketing may tell the 
marketers, for example, to change one or more of the product’s physical attributes, 
to modify the distribution plans to include more retail outlets, to alter promotional 
efforts, or to change the product’s price. Products are usually not introduced nation-
wide overnight. Most new products are marketed in stages, beginning in selected geo-
graphic areas and expanding into adjacent areas over a period of time.
Why Do Products Fail?
Despite this rigorous process for developing product ideas, most new products end up 
as failures. In fact, many well-known companies have produced market failures (see 
Table 13.2).
Why does a new product fail? Mainly because the product and its marketing pro-
gram are not planned and tested as completely as they should be. For example, to save 
on development costs, a firm may market-test its product but not its entire marketing 
mix. Alternatively, a firm may market a new product before all the “bugs” have been 
worked out. Or, when problems show up in the testing stage, a firm may try to recover 
its product development costs by pushing ahead with full-scale marketing anyway. 
Finally, some firms try to market new products with inadequate financing.
Branding, Packaging, and Labeling
Three important features of a product (particularly a consumer product) are its brand, 
package, and label. These features may be used to associate a product with a successful 
product line or to distinguish it from existing products. They may be designed to 
attract customers at the point of sale or to provide information to potential purchasers. 
Because the brand, package, and label are very real parts of the product, they deserve 
careful attention during product planning.
What Is a Brand?
A brand is a name, term, symbol, design, or any combination of these that identifies 
a seller’s products and distinguishes it from other sellers’ products. A brand name 
is the part of a brand that can be spoken. It may include letters, words, numbers, or 
pronounceable symbols, such as the ampersand in Procter & Gamble. A brand mark, 
on the other hand, is the part of a brand that is a symbol or distinctive design, such 
as the Nike “swoosh.” A trademark is a brand name or brand mark that is registered 
with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and thus is legally protected from use by

Types of Brands
Brands are often classified according to who owns 
them: manufacturers or stores. A manufacturer (or 
producer) brand, as the name implies, is a brand that 
is owned by a manufacturer. Many foods (Kellogg's 
Frosted Flakes), major appliances (Whirlpool), gasolines 
(Exxon), automobiles (Honda), and clothing (Levi’s) are sold as 
manufacturers’ brands. Some consumers prefer manufacturer 
brands because they are usually nationally known, offer 
consistent quality, and are widely available.
A store (or private) brand is a brand that is owned by 
an individual wholesaler or retailer. Among the better-known 
store brands are Kenmore and Craftsman, both owned by 
Sears. Owners of store brands claim that they can offer lower 
prices, earn greater profits, and improve customer loyalty with 
their own brands. Some companies that manufacture private 
brands also produce their own manufacturer brands. They 
often find such operations profitable because they can use 
excess capacity and at the same time avoid most marketing 
costs. Many private-branded grocery products are produced 
by companies that specialize in making private-label products. 
Most supermarkets rely heavily on their store brands because 
of store brand profitability and could not survive without hav-
ing store brands. According to the Private Label Manufacturer’s 
Association, the popularity and quality of store brands is on the 
rise, particularly among consumers who seek out good value with-
out sacrificing quality.16
Consumer confidence is the most important element in the 
success of a branded product, whether the brand is owned by a 
producer or by a retailer. Because branding identifies each product 
completely, customers can easily repurchase products that provide 
satisfaction, performance, and quality. Moreover, they can just as 
easily avoid or ignore products that do not. In supermarkets, the 
products most likely to keep their shelf space are the brands with 
large market shares and strong customer loyalty.
A generic product (sometimes called a generic brand) is a 
product with no brand at all. Its plain package carries only the 
name of the product—applesauce, peanut butter, potato chips, or 
whatever. Generic products, available in supermarkets since 1977, 
are sometimes made by the major producers that manufacture 
name brands. Even though generic brands may have accounted for 
as much as 10 percent of all grocery sales several years ago, they 
currently represent less than one-half of 1 percent.
Benefits of Branding
Both buyers and sellers benefit from branding. Because brands are easily recognizable, 
they reduce the amount of time buyers must spend shopping; buyers can quickly 
identify the brands they prefer. Choosing particular brands, such as Tommy Hilfiger, 
Polo, Nautica, or Nike, can be a way of expressing oneself. When buyers are unable 
to evaluate a product’s characteristics, brands can help them to judge the quality of 
the product. For example, most buyers are not able to judge the quality of stereo 
components but may be guided by a well-respected brand name. Brands can symbolize 
You can easily recognize a manufacturer’s brand 
because it is not sold by just one retailer. This 
brand was initiated by the manufacturer and is owned 
and supported by the manufacturer. Duracell batteries 
are sold in many retail stores.

a certain quality level to a customer, allowing that perception of quality to represent 
the actual quality of the item. Brands thus help to reduce a buyer’s perceived risk 
of purchase. Finally, customers may receive a psychological reward that comes from 
owning a brand that symbolizes status. The Lexus brand is an example.
Because buyers are already familiar with a firm’s existing brands, branding helps a 
firm to introduce a new product that carries the same brand name. Branding aids sellers in 
their promotional efforts because promotion of each branded product indirectly promotes 
other products of the same brand. H.J. Heinz, for example, markets many products with 
the Heinz brand name, such as ketchup, vinegar, vegetarian beans, gravies, barbecue sauce, 
and steak sauce. Promotion of one Heinz product indirectly promotes the others.
One chief benefit of branding is the creation of brand loyalty, the extent to which 
a customer is favorable toward buying a specific brand. The stronger the brand loyalty, 
the greater is the likelihood that buyers will consistently choose the brand. There are 
three levels of brand loyalty: recognition, preference, and insistence. Brand recognition 
is the level of loyalty at which customers are aware that the brand exists and will pur-
chase it if their preferred brands are unavailable or if they are unfamiliar with avail-
able brands. This is the weakest form of brand loyalty. Brand preference is the level of 
brand loyalty at which a customer prefers one brand over competing brands. However, 
if the preferred brand is unavailable, the customer is willing to substitute another 
brand. Brand insistence is the strongest level of brand loyalty. Brand-insistent custom-
ers strongly prefer a specific brand and will not buy substitutes. Brand insistence is the 
least common type of brand loyalty. Apple is a brand known for having brand-insistent 
customers. Every time Apple releases a new product, loyal customers will stand in line 
for hours just to be among the first to purchase it. Upon the U.K. release of the iPad 
3, a British couple waited five full days outside a London Apple store.17 Brand loyalty 
in general seems to be declining, partly due to marketers’ increased dependence on 
discounted prices, coupons, and other short-term promotions, and partly because of 
the enormous array of new products with similar characteristics.
Brand equity is the marketing and financial value associated with a brand’s 
strength in a market. Although difficult to measure, brand equity represents the value 
of a brand to an organization. The top ten most highly valued brands in the world are 
shown in Table 13.3. The four major factors that contribute to brand equity are brand 
awareness, brand associations, perceived brand quality, and brand loyalty. Brand aware-
ness leads to brand familiarity, and buyers are more likely to select a familiar brand 
than an unfamiliar one. The associations linked to a brand can connect a personality 
type or lifestyle with a particular brand. For example, customers associate Michelin 
tires with protecting family members; a De Beers diamond with a loving, long-lasting 
relationship (“A Diamond Is Forever”); and Dr Pepper with a unique taste. When

consumers are unable to judge for themselves the qual-
ity of a product, they may rely on their perception of the 
quality of the product’s brand. Finally, brand loyalty is a 
valued element of brand equity because it reduces both 
a brand’s vulnerability to competitors and the need to 
spend tremendous resources to attract new customers; 
it also provides brand visibility and encourages retailers 
to carry the brand. Companies have much work to do 
in establishing new brands to compete with well-known 
brands. Sometimes, large firms opt to purchase a well-
known brand rather than to compete with it. When Starbucks 
decided to enter the juice market, it began with acquiring the 
high-end juice brand Evolution Fresh. After it acquired the 
brand and expanded its distribution, Starbucks then unrolled a 
plan to open a chain of its own juice bars around the country.18
Marketing on the Internet is sometimes best done in col-
laboration with a better-known Web brand. For instance, Tire 
Rack, Razor Gator, Audible.com, and Shutterfly all rely on 
partnerships with Internet retail giant Amazon to increase their 
sales. Amazon provides special sections on its Web site to pro-
mote its partners and their products. As with its own products, 
Amazon gives users the ability to post online reviews of its 
partners’ products or to add them to an Amazon “wish list” 
that can be saved or e-mailed to friends. Amazon even labels 
its partners as “Amazon Trusted” when customers browse their 
sites, giving even these well-known real-world companies cred-
ibility in the online marketplace.19
Choosing and Protecting a Brand
A number of issues should be considered when selecting a brand 
name. The name should be easy for customers to say, spell, and 
recall. Short, one-syllable names such as Tide often satisfy this 
requirement. Words, numbers, and letters are combined to yield 
brand names such as Motorola’s RAZR V3 phone or BMW’s 
Z4 Roadster. The brand name should suggest, in a positive way, 
the product’s uses, special characteristics, and major benefits 
and should be distinctive enough to set it apart from competing 
brands. Choosing the right brand name has become a challenge 
because many obvious product names already have been used.
It is important that a firm select a brand that can be pro-
tected through registration, reserving it for exclusive use by that 
firm. Some brands, because of their designs, are infringed on more easily than others. 
Although registration protects trademarks domestically for ten years and can be renewed 
indefinitely, a firm should develop a system for ensuring that its trademarks will be 
renewed as needed. To protect its exclusive right to the brand, the company must ensure 
that the selected brand will not be considered an infringement on any existing brand 
already registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This task may be compli-
cated by the fact that infringement is determined by the courts, which base their decisions 
on whether a brand causes consumers to be confused, mistaken, or deceived about the 
source of the product. McDonald’s is one company that aggressively protects its trade-
marks against infringement; it has brought charges against a number of companies with 
Mc names because it fears that the use of the prefix will give consumers the impression 
that these companies are associated with or owned by McDonald’s.
A firm must guard against having its brand name become a generic term that refers 
to a general product category. Generic terms cannot be legally protected as exclusive 
brand names. For example, names such as yo-yo, aspirin, escalator, and thermos—all

Small Businesses Turn to Social 
Media for Effective Marketing
More than 70 percent of small businesses now use 
Facebook to reach their customers. Twitter, YouTube, and 
other social media tools are also popular among local firms 
around the country. Why? Because they’re an affordable 
way to interact with customers, build brand recognition, 
and reinforce loyalty.
AJ Bombers, a Milwaukee burger restaurant, 
became a local favorite within a year of its opening, 
thanks to its crowd-pleasing menu and its social-media 
activity. The business has earned thousands of Twitter 
followers, Facebook “likes,” and YouTube video views. 
Most important, AJ Bombers uses social media for two-

exclusively brand names at one time—eventually were declared generic terms that refer 
to product categories. As such, they can no longer be protected. To ensure that a brand 
name does not become a generic term, the firm should spell the name with a capital 
letter and use it as an adjective to modify the name of the general product class, as in 
Jell-O Brand Gelatin. An organization can deal directly with this problem by advertis-
ing that its brand is a trademark and should not be used generically. Firms also can use 
the registered trademark symbol ® to indicate that the brand is trademarked.
Branding Strategies
The basic branding decision for any firm is whether to brand its products. A producer 
may market its products under its own brands, private brands, or both. A retail store 
may carry only producer brands, its own brands, or both. Once either type of firm 
decides to brand, it chooses one of two branding strategies: individual branding or 
family branding.
Individual branding is the strategy in which a firm uses a different brand for each 
of its products. For example, Procter & Gamble uses individual branding for its line of 
bar soaps, which includes Ivory, Camay, Zest, Safeguard, Coast, and Olay. Individual 
branding offers two major advantages. A problem with one product will not affect 
the good name of the firm’s other products, and the different brands can be directed 
toward different market segments. For example, Marriott’s Fairfield Inns are directed 
toward budget-minded travelers, whereas Marriott Hotels are aimed toward upscale 
customers.
Family branding is the strategy in which a firm uses the same brand for all or 
most of its products. Sony, Dell, IBM, and Xerox use family branding for their entire 
product mixes. A major advantage of family branding is that the promotion of any one 
item that carries the family brand tends to help all other products with the same brand 
name. In addition, a new product has a head start when its brand name is already 
known and accepted by customers.
Brand Extensions
A brand extension occurs when an organization uses one of its existing brands to 
brand a new product in a different product category. Iams, a popular maker of dog 
food, partnered with VPI Pet Insurance to extend its brand into pet insurance. This 
brand extension was generally well received, as Iams already had a reputation for 
offering high-quality products to customers who truly care about their pets. Many 
considered it a smart move because pet insurance is an industry that is relatively free 
of major, established competitors, thus, Iams can develop strong market share.20 A 
brand extension should not be confused with a line extension. A line extension refers 
to using an existing brand on a new product in the same product category, such as a 
new flavor or new sizes. For example, Ben & Jerry’s ice cream frequently engages in 
line extension by releasing new flavors, such as Chocolate Therapy and Rocky Road-
ish. One thing marketers must be careful of, however, is extending a brand too many 
times or extending too far outside the original product category, which may weaken 
the brand. Many brands have had to recover from unsuccessful brand extensions, such 
as Harley Davidson perfume, Fritos lemonade, and Bic disposable underwear.21
Packaging
Packaging consists of all the activities involved in developing and providing a container 
with graphics for a product. The package is a vital part of the product. It can make 
the product more versatile, safer, or easier to use. Through its shape, appearance, and 
printed message, a package can influence purchasing decisions.
Packaging Functions  Effective packaging means more than simply putting prod-
ucts in containers and covering them with wrappers. The basic function of packaging 
materials is to protect the product and maintain its functional form. Fluids such as

Part 5   Marketing
milk, orange juice, and hair spray need packages that preserve and protect 
them; the packaging should prevent damage that could affect the product’s 
usefulness and increase costs. Because product tampering has become a 
problem for marketers of many types of goods, several packaging tech-
niques have been developed to counter this danger. Some packages are also 
designed to foil shoplifting.
Another function of packaging is to offer consumer convenience. For 
example, small, aseptic packages—individual-serving boxes or plastic bags 
that contain liquids and do not require refrigeration—appeal strongly to 
parents of small children and to young adults with active lifestyles. The 
size or shape of a package may relate to the product’s storage, convenience 
of use, or replacement rate. Small, single-serving cans of vegetables, for 
instance, may prevent waste and make storage easier. A third function of 
packaging is to promote a product by communicating its features, uses, 
benefits, and image. Sometimes a firm develops a reusable package to make 
its product more desirable. For example, the Cool Whip package doubles as 
a food-storage container.
Package Design Considerations  Many factors must be weighed when 
developing packages. Obviously, one major consideration is cost. Although 
a number of packaging materials, processes, and designs are available, some 
are rather expensive. Although U.S. buyers have shown a willingness to pay 
more for improved packaging, there are limits.
Marketers also must decide whether to package the product in single or 
multiple units. Multiple-unit packaging can increase demand by increasing the 
amount of the product available at the point of consumption (in the home, for 
example). However, multiple-unit packaging does not work for infrequently 
used products because buyers do not like to tie up their dollars in an excess 
supply or to store those products for a long time. However, multiple-unit pack-
aging can make storage and handling easier (as in the case of six-packs used for 
soft drinks); it can also facilitate special price offers, such as two-for-one sales. 
In addition, multiple-unit packaging may increase consumer acceptance of a 
product by encouraging the buyer to try it several times. On the other hand, 
customers may hesitate to try the product at all if they do not have the option 
to buy just one.
Marketers should consider how much consistency is desirable among an organi-
zation’s package designs. To promote an overall company image, a firm may decide 
that all packages must be similar or include one major element of the design. This 
approach, called family packaging, is sometimes used only for lines of products, as 
with Campbell’s soups, Weight Watchers entrées, and Planters nuts. The best policy 
is sometimes no consistency, especially if a firm’s products are unrelated or aimed at 
vastly different target markets.
Packages also play an important promotional role. Through verbal and nonverbal 
symbols, the package can inform potential buyers about the product’s content, uses, fea-
tures, advantages, and hazards. Firms can create desirable images and associations by 
choosing particular colors, designs, shapes, and textures. Many cosmetics manufacturers, 
for example, design their packages to create impressions of richness, luxury, and exclusive-
ness. The package performs another promotional function when it is designed to be safer 
or more convenient to use, especially if such features help to stimulate demand.
Packaging also must meet the needs of intermediaries. Wholesalers and retailers 
consider whether a package facilitates transportation, handling, and storage. Resellers 
may refuse to carry certain products if their packages are cumbersome.
Finally, firms must consider the issue of environmental responsibility when develop-
ing packages. Companies must balance consumers’ desires for convenience against the 
need to preserve the environment. About one-half of all garbage consists of discarded 
plastic packaging, such as plastic soft drink bottles and carryout bags. Plastic packaging 
material is not biodegradable, and paper necessitates destruction of valuable forest lands.

Consequently, many companies are exploring packaging alternatives and recycling more 
materials. Starbucks even holds an annual Cup Summit with packaging leaders in order 
to discuss issues related to reducing waste and increasing the recyclability of packaging. 
Many Starbucks locations offer recycling bins for used cups and other refuse in an effort 
to increase the scale of recycling and to make it more economical.22
Labeling
Labeling is the presentation of information on a product or its package. The label is 
the part that contains the information. This information may include the brand name 
and mark, the registered trademark symbol ®, the package size and contents, product 
claims, directions for use and safety precautions, a list of ingredients, the name and 
address of the manufacturer, and the Universal Product Code (UPC) symbol, which is 
used for automated checkout and inventory control.
A number of federal regulations specify information that must be included in the 
labeling for certain products. For example,
●
●Garments must be labeled with the name of the manufacturer, country of manu-
facture, fabric content, and cleaning instructions.
●
●Food labels must contain the most common term for ingredients.
●
●Any food product for which a nutritional claim is made must have nutrition label-
ing that follows a standard format.
●
●Food product labels must state the number of servings per container, the serving 
size, the number of calories per serving, the number of calories derived from fat, 
and the amounts of specific nutrients.
●
●Non-edible items such as shampoos and detergents must carry safety precautions 
as well as instructions for their use.
Such regulations are aimed at protecting customers from both misleading product 
claims and the improper (and thus unsafe) use of products. Food manufacturers are not 
allowed to make misleading health claims about their products. For example, General 
Mills was ordered to stop making claims about the heart-healthy benefits of Cheerios 
cereal. Similarly, Vitaminwater was taken to court for leading consumers to believe that 
the sugary beverage has health benefits. The Food and Drug Administration has cracked 
down on such offenses, sending out warning letters to violators.23
Labels also may carry the details of written or express warranties. An express 
warranty is a written explanation of the producer’s responsibilities in the event that a 
product is found to be defective or otherwise unsatisfactory. As a result of consumer 
discontent (along with some federal legislation), firms have begun to simplify the word-
ing of warranties and to extend their duration. Apple was forced to clarify the terms of 
its AppleCare warranty after being fined $1.2 million by Italian regulators for neglect-
ing to fully disclose the terms of the agreement. In response to the fine, Apple posted 
information pages that outline the warranties and what they cover.24
Pricing Products
A product is a set of attributes and benefits that has been carefully designed to satisfy 
its market while earning a profit for its seller. No matter how well a product is designed, 
however, it cannot help an organization to achieve its goals if it is priced incorrectly. 
Somewhere between too high and too low there is a “proper,” effective price for each 
product. Let’s take a closer look at how businesses go about determining a product’s 
right price.
The Meaning and Use of Price
The price of a product is the amount of money a seller is willing to accept in exchange 
for the product at a given time and under given circumstances. At times, the price 
results from negotiations between buyer and seller. In many business situations,

demand  the quantity of a product

however, the price is fixed by the seller. Suppose that a seller sets 
a price of $10 for a particular product. In essence, the seller is 
saying, “Anyone who wants this product can have it here and now 
in exchange for $10.”
Each interested buyer then makes a personal judgment regard-
ing the product’s utility, often in terms of some dollar value. A par-
ticular person who feels that he or she will get at least $10 worth of 
want satisfaction (or value) from the product is likely to buy it. If 
that person can get more want satisfaction by spending $10 in some 
other way, however, he or she will not buy the product.
Price thus serves the function of allocator. First, it allocates 
goods and services among those who are willing and able to buy 
them. (As we noted in Chapter 1, the answer to the economic ques-
tion “For whom to produce?” depends primarily on prices.) Second, 
price allocates financial resources (sales revenue) among producers 
according to how well they satisfy customers’ needs. Third, price 
helps customers to allocate their own financial resources among 
various want-satisfying products.
Supply and Demand Affects Prices
In Chapter 1, we defined the supply of a product as the quantity of the product that 
producers are willing to sell at each of various prices. We can draw a graph of the 
supply relationship for a particular product, say, a pair of jeans (see the left graph 
in Figure 13.3). Note that the quantity supplied by producers increases as the price 
increases along this supply curve.
As defined in Chapter 1, the demand for a product is the quantity that buyers are 
willing to purchase at each of various prices. We can also draw a graph of the demand 
relationship (see the center graph in Figure 13.3). Note that the quantity demanded by 
purchasers increases as the price decreases along the demand curve. The buyers and 
sellers of a product interact in the marketplace. We can show this interaction by super-
imposing the supply curve onto the demand curve for our product, as shown in the right 
graph in Figure 13.3. The two curves intersect at point E, which represents a quantity 
of 15 million pairs of jeans and a price of $30 per pair. Point E is on the supply curve; 
thus, producers are willing to supply 15 million pairs at $30 each. Point E is also on the 
demand curve; thus, buyers are willing to purchase 15 million pairs at $30 each. Point E

before many of its competitors did the same thing.

Price and Non-Price Competition
Before a product’s price can be set, an organization must determine the basis on which 
it will compete—whether on price alone or some combination of factors. The choice 
influences pricing decisions as well as other marketing-mix variables.
Price competition occurs when a seller emphasizes a product’s low price and sets 
a price that equals or beats competitors’ prices. To use this approach most effectively, 
a seller must have the flexibility to change prices often and must do so rapidly and 
aggressively whenever competitors change their prices. Price competition allows a mar-
keter to set prices based on demand for the product or in response to changes in the 
firm’s finances. Competitors can do likewise, however, which is a major drawback of 
price competition. They, too, can quickly match or outdo an organization’s price cuts. 
In addition, if circumstances force a seller to raise prices, competing firms may be able 
to maintain their lower prices. The Internet has made it more difficult than ever for 
sellers to compete on the basis of price, as consumers can quickly and easily conduct 
comparison-shopping online. Lower-priced competitors for pricy but popular products 
quickly crop up. For example, the Apple iPad tablet controls nearly three-quarters of 
the tablet market, but less expensive tablets running on Google’s Android operating 
system are providing consumers with different options with lower price tags.25
Non-price competition is competition based on factors other than price. It is used 
most effectively when a seller can make its product stand out from the competition by 
distinctive product quality, customer service, promotion, packaging, or other features. 
Buyers must be able to perceive these distinguishing characteristics and consider them 
desirable. Once customers have chosen a brand for non-price reasons, they may not be 
attracted as easily to competing firms and brands. In this way, a seller can build customer 
loyalty to its brand. A method of non-price competition, product differentiation, is the 
process of developing and promoting differences between one’s product and all similar 
products. Vibram Five Fingers shoes, for example, are sufficiently differentiated from 
the competition that marketers do not have to compete on price. The shoes have highly 
distinct styling and are unlike any other shoe on the market. Designed in the silhouette 
of a foot, tracing the shape of each individual toe, they appeal to athletes who want to 
protect the soles of their feet while also having a barefoot experience.26
Buyers’ Perceptions of Price
In setting prices, managers should consider the price sensitivity of people in the target 
market. How important is price to them? Is it always “very important”? Members of 
one market segment may be more influenced by price than members of another. For a 
particular product, the price may be a bigger factor for some buyers than for others. 
For example, buyers may be more sensitive to price when purchasing gasoline than 
when purchasing running shoes.
Buyers will accept different ranges of prices for different products; that is, they 
will tolerate a narrow range for certain items and a wider range for others. Consider 
the wide range of prices that consumers pay for soft drinks—from 15 cents per ounce 
at the movies down to 1.5 cents per ounce on sale at the grocery store. Management 
should be aware of these limits of acceptability and the products to which they apply. 
The firm also should take note of buyers’ perceptions of a given product in relation to 
competing products. A premium price may be appropriate if a product is considered 
superior to others in its category or if the product has inspired strong brand loyalty. 
On the other hand, if buyers have even a hint of a negative view of a product, a lower 
price may be necessary.
Sometimes buyers relate price to quality. They may consider a higher price to be 
an indicator of higher quality. Managers involved in pricing decisions should determine 
whether this outlook is widespread in the target market. If it is, a higher price may 
improve the image of a product and, in turn, make the product more desirable.

Part 5   Marketing
Pricing Objectives 
Before setting prices for a firm’s products, management must decide what it expects to 
accomplish through pricing. That is, management must set pricing objectives that are 
in line with both organizational and marketing objectives. Of course, one objective of 
pricing is to make a profit, but this may not be a firm’s primary objective. One or more 
of the following factors may be just as important.
Survival
A firm may have to price its products to survive—either as an organization 
or as a player in a particular market. This usually means that the firm will 
cut its price to attract customers, even if it then must operate at a loss. 
Obviously, such a goal hardly can be pursued on a long-term basis, for 
consistent losses would cause the business to fail. Even Abercrombie and 
Fitch (A&F) had to resort to price reductions on its luxury-priced clothing 
to stay in business during the recent economic downturn. A&F’s 2009 
first-quarter result was a loss of almost $27 million, compared to 2008’s 
income of over $62 million. This drastic difference forced the retailer to 
adjust prices to better complement customers’ smaller budgets.27
Profit Maximization
Many firms may state that their goal is to maximize profit, but this goal 
is impossible to define (and thus impossible to achieve). What, exactly, is 
the maximum profit? How does a firm know when it has been reached? 
Firms that wish to set profit goals should express them as either specific 
dollar amounts, or percentage increases, over previous profits.
Target Return on Investment
The return on investment (ROI) is the amount earned as a result of that 
investment. Some firms set an annual percentage ROI as their pricing 
goal. ConAgra, the company that produces Healthy Choice meals and 
a multitude of other products, has a target after-tax ROI of 20 percent.
Market-Share Goals
A firm’s market share is its proportion of total industry sales. Some firms 
attempt, through pricing, to maintain or increase their market shares. 
Both U.S. cola giants, Coke and Pepsi, try to gain market share through 
aggressive pricing and other marketing efforts.
Status-Quo Pricing
In pricing their products, some firms are guided by a desire to avoid “making 
waves,” or to maintain the status quo. This is especially true in industries 
that depend on price stability. If such a firm can maintain its profit or market share simply 
by meeting the competition—charging about the same price as competitors for similar 
products—then it will do so.
Pricing Methods
Once a firm has developed its pricing objectives, it must select a pricing method 
to reach that goal. Two factors are important to every firm engaged in setting 
prices. The first is recognition that the market, and not the firm’s costs, ultimately 
determines the price at which a product will sell. The second is awareness that 
costs and expected sales can be used only to establish some sort of price floor, the

What does a product’s price communicate 
to you?  How buyers perceive a product is 
often determined by its price. High prices 
communicate quality and status—which is 
why the makers of luxury goods such as Rolex 
watches are often reluctant to sell them at a 
discount. The producers of these goods don’t 
want to “cheapen” their brands for a quick sales 
boost because it could hurt the image of these 
brands.

minimum price at which the firm can sell its product without incurring a loss. In 
this section, we look at three kinds of pricing methods: cost-based, demand-based, 
and competition-based pricing.
Cost-Based Pricing
Using the simplest method of pricing, cost-based pricing, the seller first determines the 
total cost of producing (or purchasing) one unit of the product. The seller then adds 
an amount to cover additional costs (such as insurance or interest) and profit. The 
amount that is added is called the markup. The total of the cost plus the markup is 
the product’s selling price.
A firm’s management can calculate markup as a percentage of its total costs. Suppose, 
for example, that the total cost of manufacturing and marketing 1,000 DVD players is 
$100,000, or $100 per unit. If the manufacturer wants a markup that is 20 percent above 
its costs, the selling price will be $100 plus 20 percent of $100, or $120 per unit.
Markup pricing is easy to apply, and it is used by many businesses (mostly retail-
ers and wholesalers). However, it has two major flaws. The first is the difficulty of 
determining an effective markup percentage. If this percentage is too high, the product 
may be overpriced for its market; then too few units may be sold to return the total 
cost of producing and marketing the product. In contrast, if the markup percentage is 
too low, the seller is “giving away” profit it could have earned simply by assigning a 
higher price. In other words, the markup percentage needs to be set to account for the 
workings of the market, and that is very difficult to do.
The second problem with markup pricing is that it separates pricing from other 
business functions. The product is priced after production quantities are determined, 
after costs are incurred, and almost without regard for the market or the marketing 
mix. To be most effective, the various business functions should be integrated. Each 
should have an impact on all marketing decisions.
Cost-based pricing can also be facilitated through the use of breakeven analysis. 
For any product, the breakeven quantity is the number of units that must be sold for 
the total revenue (from all units sold) to equal the total cost (of all units sold). Total 
revenue is the total amount received from the sales of a product. We can estimate pro-
jected total revenue as the selling price multiplied by the number of units sold.
The costs involved in operating a business can be broadly classified as either fixed 
or variable costs. A fixed cost is a cost incurred no matter how many units of a 
product are produced or sold. Rent, for example, is a fixed cost; it remains the same 
whether 1 or 1,000 units are produced. A variable cost is a cost that depends on the 
number of units produced. The cost of fabricating parts for a stereo receiver is a vari-
able cost. The more units produced, the more parts that will be needed, and thus the 
higher cost of fabricating parts. The total cost of producing a certain number of units 
is the sum of the fixed costs and the variable costs attributed to those units.
If we assume a particular selling price, we can find the breakeven quantity either 
graphically or by using a formula. Figure 13.4 graphs the total revenue earned and the 
total cost incurred by the sale of various quantities of a hypothetical product. With 
fixed costs of $40,000, variable costs of $60 per unit, and a selling price of $120, the 
breakeven quantity is 667 units. To find the breakeven quantity, first deduct the vari-
able cost from the selling price to determine how much money the sale of one unit 
contributes to offsetting fixed costs. Then divide that contribution into the total fixed 
costs to arrive at the breakeven quantity. (The breakeven quantity in Figure 13.4 is the 
quantity represented by the intersection of the total revenue and total cost axes.) If the 
firm sells more than 667 units at $120 each, it will earn a profit. If it sells fewer units, 
it will suffer a loss.
Demand-Based Pricing
Rather than basing the price of a product on its cost, companies sometimes use a 
pricing method based on the level of demand for the product: demand-based pricing. 
This method results in a high price when product demand is strong and a low price

Part 5   Marketing
when demand is weak. Some long-distance telephone companies use demand-based 
pricing. To use this method, a marketer estimates the amount of a product that 
customers will demand at different prices and then chooses the price that generates 
the highest total revenue. Obviously, the effectiveness of this method depends on the 
firm’s ability to estimate demand accurately. In order to address severe problems 
with parking shortages, the city of San Francisco adopted a demand-based parking 
meter system. Rates are raised and lowered throughout the day according to demand. 
The city hopes that the variable fees will help smooth demand for parking spaces 
and traffic by encouraging people to park outside of congested 
areas and either walk, bike, or bus to their final destination. The 
plan is being watched closely by other cities, such as Boston, as 
a potential market-driven solution to parking and transportation 
problems.28
A firm may favor a demand-based pricing method called price 
differentiation if it wants to use more than one price in the market-
ing of a specific product. Price differentiation can be based on such 
considerations as time of the purchase, type of customer, or type of 
distribution channel. Sports arenas increasingly use demand-based 
pricing to sell tickets to events. Seats for single games are priced 
according to fan demand, meaning that the most popular seats 
sell for the highest price, no matter what the location within the 
stadium or arena. The St. Louis Cardinals, San Francisco Giants, 
and Minnesota Twins all utilize demand-based pricing. The Twins, 
for instance, began this practice in 2011 for two seating sections. 
It was so successful that the sports franchise decided to expand 
demand-based pricing for subsequent seasons.29 For price differ-
entiation to work correctly, the company first must be able to seg-
ment a market on the basis of different strengths of demand. The 
company must then be able to keep the segments separate enough 
so that those who buy at lower prices cannot sell to buyers in 
Breakeven analysis answers the question: What is the lowest level of production 
and sales at which a company can break even on a particular product?

Price comparisons are nothing new: Anybody 
with Internet access (via smartphone, tablet, 
or computer) can easily find out how much 
online retailers charge for items also sold in local 
stores. Still, bricks-and-mortar stores were outraged when 
Amazon.com first encouraged consumers to download its 
price-check app and use it to compare prices as they browsed 
in stores. Why? Because the app included a special incentive to 
comparison-shop and then buy from Amazon.
While standing in a store, the user would scan (or 
photograph) the UPC product code of an item they might 
buy and wait to see Amazon’s price for the same item. If the 
user bought that item from Amazon within 24 hours, the 
price would be discounted by $5. Amazon promoted its app 
during the year-end holiday shopping season, generating a 
lot of downloads and a lot of controversy.
Critics said the app turned local stores into showrooms 
where customers examined products, asked questions, and 
then bought from Amazon. In fact, surveys show that 20 
percent of consumers research purchases such as kitchen 
appliances in local stores before they buy from an Internet 
retailer. Meanwhile, Amazon has been getting valuable 
competitive pricing data and boosting its sales. What are the 
ethics of price-check apps?

segments that are charged a higher price. This isolation can be accomplished, for 
example, by selling to geographically separated segments.
Compared with cost-based pricing, demand-based pricing places a firm in a better 
position to attain higher profit levels, assuming that buyers value the product at levels 
sufficiently above the product’s cost. To use demand-based pricing, however, manage-
ment must be able to estimate demand at different price levels, which may be difficult 
to do accurately.
Competition-Based Pricing
In using competition-based pricing, an organization considers costs and revenue 
secondary to competitors’ prices. The importance of this method increases if competing 
products are quite similar and the organization is serving markets in which price is 
the crucial variable of the marketing strategy. A firm that uses competition-based 
pricing may choose to be below competitors’ prices, slightly above competitors’ 
prices, or at the same level. The price that your bookstore paid to the publishing 
company of this text was determined using competition-based pricing. Competition-
based pricing can help to attain a pricing objective to increase sales or market share. 
Competition-based pricing may also be combined with other cost approaches to 
arrive at profitable levels.
Pricing Strategies 
A pricing strategy is a course of action designed to achieve pricing objectives. Generally, 
pricing strategies help marketers to solve the practical problems of setting prices. 
The extent to which a business uses any of the following strategies depends on its 
pricing and marketing objectives, the markets for its products, the degree of product 
differentiation, the product’s life-cycle stage, and other factors. Figure 13.5 contains a 
list of the major types of pricing strategies. We discuss these strategies in the remainder 
of this section.

price skimming  the strategy of 
charging the highest possible 
price for a product during the 
introduction stage of its life-cycle
penetration pricing  the strategy 
of setting a low price for a new 
product
New-Product Pricing
The two primary types of new-product pricing strategies are price skimming and 
penetration pricing. An organization can use either one, or even both, over a period 
of time.
Price Skimming  Some consumers are willing to pay a high price for an innovative 
product either because of its novelty or because of the prestige or status that owner-
ship confers. Price skimming is the strategy of charging the highest possible price for 
a product during the introduction stage of its life-cycle. The seller essentially “skims the 
cream” off the market, which helps to recover the high costs of R&D more quickly. In 
addition, a skimming policy may hold down demand for the product, which is helpful 
if the firm’s production capacity is limited during the introduction stage. A danger is 
that a price-skimming strategy may make the product appear more lucrative than it 
actually is to potential competitors.
Penetration Pricing  At the opposite extreme, penetration pricing is the strategy 
of setting a low price for a new product. The main purpose of setting a low price is 
to build market share for the product quickly. The seller hopes that building a large 
market share quickly will discourage competitors from entering the market. If the low 
price stimulates sales, the firm also may be able to order longer production runs, which 
result in lower production costs per unit. A disadvantage of penetration pricing is that 
it places a firm in a less flexible position. It is more difficult to raise prices significantly 
than it is to lower them.
Differential Pricing
An important issue in pricing decisions is whether to use a single price or different 
prices for the same product. A single price is easily understood by both employees and 
customers. Since many salespeople and customers do not like having to negotiate a 
price, having a single price reduces the chance of a marketer developing an adversarial 
relationship with a customer.
Differential pricing means charging different prices to different buyers for the same 
quality and quantity of product. For differential pricing to be effective, the market 
must consist of multiple segments with different price sensitivities. When this method 
is employed, caution should be used to avoid confusing or antagonizing customers. 
Differential pricing can occur in several ways, including negotiated pricing, secondary-
market pricing, periodic discounting, and random discounting.
Companies have a variety of pricing strategies available to them.

Chapter 13   Creating and Pricing Products That Satisfy Customers	
383
negotiated pricing  establishing a 
final price through bargaining
secondary-market pricing  setting 
one price for the primary target 
market and a different price for 
another market
periodic discounting  temporary 
reduction of prices on a patterned 
or systematic basis
random discounting  temporary 
reduction of prices on an 
unsystematic basis
odd-number pricing  the strategy 
of setting prices using odd 
numbers that are slightly below 
whole-dollar amounts
multiple-unit pricing  the strategy 
of setting a single price for two or 
more units
reference pricing  pricing a 
product at a moderate level and 
positioning it next to a more 
expensive model or brand
Negotiated Pricing  Negotiated pricing occurs when the final price is established 
through bargaining between the seller and the customer. Negotiated pricing occurs in 
a number of industries and at all levels of distribution. Even when there is a predeter-
mined stated price or a price list, manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers still may 
negotiate to establish the final sales price. Consumers commonly negotiate prices for 
houses, cars, and used equipment.
Secondary-Market Pricing  Secondary-market pricing means setting one price 
for the primary target market and a different price for another market. Often the 
price charged in the secondary market is lower. However, when the costs of serving a 
secondary market are higher than normal, secondary-market customers may have to 
pay a higher price. Examples of secondary markets include a geographically isolated 
domestic market, a market in a foreign country, and a segment willing to purchase a 
product during off-peak times (such as “early bird” diners at restaurants and off-peak 
users of mobile phones).
Periodic Discounting  Periodic discounting is the temporary reduction of prices 
on a patterned or systematic basis. For example, many retailers have annual holiday 
sales, and some women’s apparel stores have two seasonal sales each year—a winter 
sale in the last two weeks of January and a summer sale in the first two weeks of July. 
From the marketer’s point of view, a major problem with periodic discounting is that 
customers can predict when the reductions will occur and may delay their purchases 
until they can take advantage of the lower prices.
Random Discounting  To alleviate the problem of customers’ knowing when discount-
ing will occur, some organizations employ random discounting. That is, they reduce their 
prices temporarily on a nonsystematic basis. When price reductions of a product occur 
randomly, current users of that brand are unlikely to predict when the reductions will 
occur; therefore, they will not delay their purchases in anticipation of buying the product 
at a lower price. Marketers also use random discounting to attract new customers.
Psychological Pricing
Psychological pricing strategies encourage purchases based on emotional responses 
rather than on economically rational responses. These strategies are used primarily for 
consumer products rather than business products.
Odd-Number Pricing  Many retailers believe that consumers respond more posi-
tively to odd-number prices such as $4.99 than to whole-dollar prices such as $5. Odd-
number pricing is the strategy of setting prices using odd numbers that are slightly 
below whole-dollar amounts. Nine and five are the most popular ending figures for 
odd-number prices.
Sellers who use this strategy believe that odd-number prices increase sales. The 
strategy is not limited to low-priced items. Auto manufacturers may set the price of a 
car at $11,999 rather than $12,000. Odd-number pricing has been the subject of vari-
ous psychological studies, but the results have been inconclusive.
Multiple-Unit Pricing  Many retailers (and especially supermarkets) practice multi-
ple-unit pricing, setting a single price for two or more units, such as two cans for 99 
cents rather than 50 cents per can. Especially for frequently purchased products, this 
strategy can increase sales. Customers who see the single price and who expect eventually 
to use more than one unit of the product regularly purchase multiple units to save money.
Reference Pricing  Reference pricing means pricing a product at a moderate level 
and positioning it next to a more expensive model or brand in the hope that the

Part 5   Marketing
customer will use the higher price as a reference price (i.e., a 
comparison price). Because of the comparison, the customer 
is expected to view the moderate price favorably.
Bundle Pricing  Bundle pricing is the packaging together 
of two or more products, usually of a complementary nature, 
to be sold for a single price. To be attractive to customers, the 
single price usually is considerably less than the sum of the 
prices of the individual products. Being able to buy the bun-
dled combination of products in a single transaction may 
be of value to the customer as well. Bundle pricing is used 
commonly for banking and travel services, computers, and 
automobiles with option packages. Bundle pricing can help 
to increase customer satisfaction. By bundling slow-moving 
products with ones with a higher turnover, an organization 
can stimulate sales and increase its revenues. Selling prod-
ucts as a package rather than individually also may result in 
cost savings. It is common for telecommunications provid-
ers to sell service bundles of cable, Internet, and phone service for one price. AT&T, 
Comcast, and DirectTV all offer such services.
Everyday Low Prices (EDLPs)  To reduce or eliminate the use of frequent short-term 
price reductions, some organizations use an approach referred to as everyday low prices 
(EDLPs). When EDLPs are used, a marketer sets a low price for its products on a con-
sistent basis rather than setting higher prices and frequently discounting them. EDLPs, 
though not deeply discounted, are set far enough below competitors’ prices to make 
customers feel confident that they are receiving a fair price. EDLPs are employed by 
retailers such as Walmart and by manufacturers such as Procter & Gamble. A company 
that uses EDLPs benefits from reduced promotional costs, reduced losses from frequent 
markdowns, and more stability in its sales. A major problem with this approach is that 
customers have mixed responses to it. In some instances, customers simply do not believe 
that EDLPs are what they say they are but are instead a marketing gimmick.
Customary Pricing  In customary pricing, certain goods are priced primarily on 
the basis of tradition. Examples of customary, or traditional, prices would be those set 
for candy bars and chewing gum.
Product-Line Pricing
Rather than considering products on an item-by-item basis when determining pricing 
strategies, some marketers employ product-line pricing. Product-line pricing means 
establishing and adjusting the prices of multiple products within a product line. 
Product-line pricing can provide marketers with flexibility in price setting. For 
example, marketers can set prices so that one product is quite profitable, whereas 
another increases market share by virtue of having a lower price than competing 
products.
When marketers employ product-line pricing, they have several strategies from 
which to choose. These include captive pricing, premium pricing, and price lining.
Captive Pricing  When captive pricing is used, the basic product in a product line 
is priced low, but the price on the items required to operate or enhance it are set at a 
higher level. Two common examples of captive pricing are razor blades and printer ink. 
The razor handle and the printer are generally priced quite low, but the razor blades 
and the printer ink replacement cartridges are usually very expensive. Sometimes, a 
brand will even give away the razor handle because it knows that consumers will then 
be compelled to buy the requisite razor blades.
bundle pricing  packaging together 
two or more complementary 
products and selling them for a 
single price
everyday low prices 
(EDLPs)  setting a low price for 
products on a consistent basis
customary pricing  pricing on the 
basis of tradition
captive pricing  pricing the basic 
product in a product line low, but 
pricing related items at a higher 
level
The benefits of bundling.  Companies like Verizon bundle their 
goods and services to entice consumers to purchase multiple 
products. This can increase a firm’s market share as well as get 
consumers interested in products they might not have been 
willing to purchase alone. Bundling can also help a firm match or 
undercut its competitors’ prices, especially if the competitor offers 
a single product or has fewer of them to bundle.

Chapter 13   Creating and Pricing Products That Satisfy Customers	
385
premium pricing  pricing the 
highest-quality or most-versatile 
products higher than other models 
in the product line
price lining  the strategy of 
selling goods only at certain 
predetermined prices that reflect 
definite price breaks
price leaders  products priced 
below the usual markup, near 
cost, or below cost
special-event pricing  advertised 
sales or price cutting linked to a 
holiday, season, or event
comparison discounting  setting 
a price at a specific level and 
comparing it with a higher price
Premium Pricing  Premium pricing occurs when the highest-quality product or the 
most-versatile version of similar products in a product line is given the highest price. 
Other products in the line are priced to appeal to price-sensitive shoppers or to those 
who seek product-specific features. Marketers that use premium pricing often realize a 
significant portion of their profits from premium-priced products. Examples of prod-
uct categories in which premium pricing is common are small kitchen appliances, beer, 
ice cream, and television cable service.
Price Lining  Price lining is the strategy of selling goods only at certain predeter-
mined prices that reflect definite price breaks. For example, a shop may sell men’s ties 
only at $22 and $37. This strategy is used widely in clothing and accessory stores. It 
eliminates minor price differences from the buying decision—both for customers and 
for managers who buy merchandise to sell in these stores.
Promotional Pricing
Price, as an ingredient in the marketing mix, often is coordinated with promotion. 
The two variables sometimes are so interrelated that the pricing policy is promotion 
oriented. Examples of promotional pricing include price leaders, special-event pricing, 
and comparison discounting.
Price Leaders  Sometimes a firm prices a few products below the usual markup, near 
cost, or below cost, which results in prices known as price leaders. This type of pricing 
is used most often in supermarkets and restaurants to attract customers by giving them 
especially low prices on a few items. Management hopes that sales of regularly priced 
products will more than offset the reduced revenues from the price leaders.
Special-Event Pricing  To increase sales volume, many organizations coordinate 
price with advertising or sales promotions for seasonal or special situations. Special-
event pricing involves advertised sales or price cutting linked to a holiday, season, or 
event. If the pricing objective is survival, then special sales events may be designed to 
generate the necessary operating capital.
Comparison Discounting  Comparison discounting sets the price of a product at a 
specific level and simultaneously compares it with a higher price. The higher price may be 
the product’s previous price, the price of a competing brand, the product’s price at another 
retail outlet, or a manufacturer’s suggested retail price. Customers may find comparative 
discounting informative, and it can have a significant impact on them. However, because 
this pricing strategy on occasion has led to deceptive pricing practices, the Federal Trade 
Commission has established guidelines for comparison discounting. If the higher price 
against which the comparison is made is the price formerly charged for the product, sell-
ers must have made the previous price available to customers for a reasonable period of 
time. If sellers present the higher price as the one charged by other retailers in the same 
trade area, they must be able to demonstrate that this claim is true. When they present 
the higher price as the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, then the higher price must 
be similar to the price at which a reasonable proportion of the product was sold. Some 
manufacturers’ suggested retail prices are so high that very few products actually are sold 
at those prices. In such cases, it would be deceptive to use comparison discounting.
Pricing Business Products
Many of the pricing issues discussed thus far in this chapter deal with pricing in general. 
However, setting prices for business products can be different from setting prices for 
consumer products owing to several factors such as size of purchases, transportation 
considerations, and geographic issues. We examine three types of pricing associated 
with business products: geographic pricing, transfer pricing, and discounting.
Describe three major types 
of pricing associated with 
business products.

Discounts Used for Business Markets
Type
Reasons for Use
Examples
Trade 
(functional)
To attract and keep effective resellers by compensating 
them for performing certain functions, such as 
transportation, warehousing, selling, and providing 
credit.
A college bookstore pays about one-third less for a 
new textbook than the retail price a student pays.
Quantity
To encourage customers to buy large quantities when 
making purchases and, in the case of cumulative 
discounts, to encourage customer loyalty.
Numerous companies serving business markets allow 
a 2 percent discount if an account is paid within ten 
days.
Seasonal
To allow a marketer to use resources more efficiently 
by stimulating sales during off-peak periods.
Florida hotels provide companies holding national 
and regional sales meetings with deeply discounted 
accommodations during the summer months.
Allowance
In the case of a trade-in allowance, to assist the 
buyer in making the purchase and potentially earn a 
profit on the resale of used equipment; in the case 
of a promotional allowance, to ensure that dealers 
participate in advertising and sales support programs.
A farm equipment dealer takes a farmer’s used 
tractor as a trade-in on a new one. Nabisco pays a 
promotional allowance to a supermarket for setting up 
and maintaining a large end-of-aisle display for a two-
week period.
Geographic Pricing
Geographic pricing strategies deal with delivery costs. The pricing strategy that 
requires the buyer to pay the delivery costs is called FOB origin pricing. It stands for 
“free on board at the point of origin,” which means that the price does not include 
freight charges, and thus the buyer must pay the transportation costs from the seller’s 
warehouse to the buyer’s place of business. FOB destination indicates that the price 
does include freight charges, and thus the seller pays these charges.
Transfer Pricing
When one unit in an organization sells a product to another unit, transfer pricing 
occurs. The price is determined by calculating the cost of the product. A transfer 
price can vary depending on the types of costs included in the calculations. The 
choice of the costs to include when calculating the transfer price depends on 
the company’s management strategy and the nature of the units’ interaction. An 
organization also must ensure that transfer pricing is fair to all units involved in 
the purchases.
Discounting
A discount is a deduction from the price of an item. Producers and sellers offer a wide 
variety of discounts to their customers, including trade, quantity, cash, and seasonal 
discounts as well as allowances. Trade discounts are discounts from the list prices 
that are offered to marketing intermediaries, or middlemen. Quantity discounts are 
discounts given to customers who buy in large quantities. The seller’s per-unit selling 
cost is lower for larger purchases. Cash discounts are discounts offered for prompt 
payment. A seller may offer a discount of “2/10, net 30,” meaning that the buyer may 
take a 2 percent discount if the bill is paid within ten days and that the bill must be paid 
in full within 30 days. A seasonal discount is a price reduction to buyers who purchase 
out of season. This discount lets the seller maintain steadier production during the year. 
An allowance is a reduction in price to achieve a desired goal. Trade-in allowances, 
for example, are price reductions granted for turning in used equipment, like aircraft, 
when purchasing new equipment. Table 13.4 describes some of the reasons for using 
these discounting techniques as well as some examples.

Chapter 13   Creating and Pricing Products That Satisfy Customers	
387
Explain what a product is and how products 
are classified.
A product is everything one receives in an exchange, including 
all attributes and expected benefits. The product may be a 
manufactured item, a service, an idea, or some combination 
of these.
Products are classified according to their ultimate use. 
Classification affects a product’s distribution, promotion, 
and pricing. Consumer products, which include convenience, 
shopping, and specialty products, are purchased to satisfy 
personal and family needs. Business products are purchased 
for resale, for making other products, or for use in a firm’s 
operations. Business products can be classified as raw mate-
rials, major equipment, accessory equipment, component 
parts, process materials, supplies, and services.
Discuss the product life-cycle and how it leads to 
new-product development.
Every product moves through a series of four stages—
introduction, growth, maturity, and decline—which together 
form the product life-cycle. As the product progresses through 
these stages, its sales and profitability increase, peak, and 
then decline. Marketers keep track of the life-cycle stage of 
products in order to estimate when a new product should be 
introduced to replace a declining one.
Define product line and product mix and distinguish 
between the two.
A product line is a group of similar products marketed by a 
firm. The products in a product line are related to each other 
in the way they are produced, marketed, and used. The firm’s 
product mix includes all the products it offers for sale. The 
width of a mix is the number of product lines it contains. 
The depth of the mix is the average number of individual 
products within each line.
Identify the methods available for changing a 
product mix.
Customer satisfaction and organizational objectives require 
marketers to develop, adjust, and maintain an effective 
product mix. Marketers may improve a product mix by 
changing existing products, deleting products, and developing 
new products.
New products are developed through a series of seven 
steps. The first step, idea generation, involves the accumula-
tion of a pool of possible product ideas. Screening, the sec-
ond step, removes from consideration those product ideas 
that do not mesh with organizational goals or resources. 
Concept testing, the third step, is a phase in which a small 
sample of potential buyers is exposed to a proposed product 
through a written or oral description in order to determine 
their initial reaction and buying intentions. The fourth step, 
business analysis, generates information about the potential 
sales, costs, and profits. During the development step, the 
product idea is transformed into mock-ups and actual pro-
totypes to determine if the product is technically feasible to

Inside
Business
Pursuing ever-higher market share, PepsiCo continues to 
face head-to-head competition with Coca-Cola, Kraft, 
and other international and local food and beverage rivals. 
Although price is a big part of its marketing strategy, 
PepsiCo puts even more emphasis on product differentia-
tion. This is why it has been cooking up line extensions 
to be introduced under its billion-dollar brands, with dis-
tinctive flavors and diverse package sizes for a range of 
customer preferences and budgets.
Innovative product lines such as the Trop50 reduced-
calorie juices earn PepsiCo higher profit margins because 
customers will pay more for unique flavors and valued 
benefits. No wonder PepsiCo is pouring more money into 
developing new products and building on brand equity 
by marketing its beverage and snack brands together for 
more impact.
Questions
1.	 How is PepsiCo using price differentiation in market-
ing its soft drinks?
2.	 How does the product life-cycle help to explain why 
PepsiCo introduces so many flavor variations of 
Doritos snacks and Mountain Dew soft drinks?

build and can be produced at reasonable costs. Test mar-
keting is an actual launch of the product in several selected 
cities. Finally, during commercialization, plans for full-scale 
production and marketing are refined and implemented. 
Most product failures result from inadequate product plan-
ning and development.
Explain the uses and importance of branding, 
packaging, and labeling.
A brand is a name, term, symbol, design, or any combination 
of these that identifies a seller’s products as distinct from 
those of other sellers. Brands can be classified as manufacturer 
brands, store brands, or generic brands. A firm can choose 
between two branding strategies—individual branding or 
family branding. Branding strategies are used to associate 
(or not associate) particular products with existing products, 
producers, or intermediaries. Packaging protects goods, offers 
consumer convenience, and enhances marketing efforts by 
communicating product features, uses, benefits, and image. 
Labeling provides customers with product information, some 
of which is required by law.
Describe the economic basis of pricing and the 
means by which sellers can control prices and  
buyers’ perceptions of prices.
Under the ideal conditions of pure competition, an individual 
seller has no control over the price of its products. Prices are 
determined by the workings of supply and demand. In our real 
economy, however, sellers do exert some control, primarily 
through product differentiation. Product differentiation is 
the process of developing and promoting differences between 
one’s product and all similar products. Firms also attempt to 
gain some control over pricing through advertising. A few 
large sellers have considerable control over prices because 
each controls a large proportion of the total supply of the 
product. Firms must consider the relative importance of price 
to buyers in the target market before setting prices. Buyers’ 
perceptions of prices are affected by the importance of the 
product to them, the range of prices they consider acceptable, 
their perceptions of competing products, and their association 
of quality with price.
Identify the major pricing objectives used by 
businesses.
Objectives of pricing include survival, profit maximization, 
target return on investment, achieving market goals, and 
maintaining the status quo. Firms sometimes have to price 
products to survive, which usually requires cutting prices 
to attract customers. ROI is the amount earned as a result 
of the investment in developing and marketing the product. 
The firm sets an annual percentage ROI as the pricing goal. 
Some firms use pricing to maintain or increase their market 
share. And in industries in which price stability is important, 
firms often price their products by charging about the same 
as competitors.
Examine the three major pricing methods that 
firms employ.
The three major pricing methods are cost-based pricing, 
demand-based pricing, and competition-based pricing. When 
cost-based pricing is employed, a proportion of the cost is 
added to the total cost to determine the selling price. When 
demand-based pricing is used, the price will be higher when 
demand is higher, and the price will be lower when demand 
is lower. A firm that uses competition-based pricing may 
choose to price below competitors’ prices, at the same level 
as competitors’ prices, or slightly above competitors’ prices.
Explain the different strategies available to 
companies for setting prices.
Pricing strategies fall into five categories: new-product 
pricing, differential pricing, psychological pricing, product-
line pricing, and promotional pricing. Price skimming and 
penetration pricing are two strategies used for pricing new 
products. Differential pricing can be accomplished through 
negotiated pricing, secondary-market pricing, periodic 
discounting, and random discounting. Types of psychological 
pricing strategies are odd-number pricing, multiple-unit 
pricing, reference pricing, bundle pricing, everyday low prices, 
and customary pricing. Product-line pricing can be achieved 
through captive pricing, premium pricing, and price lining. 
The major types of promotional pricing are price-leader 
pricing, special-event pricing, and comparison discounting.
Describe three major types of pricing associated 
with business products.
Setting prices for business products can be different from 
setting prices for consumer products as a result of several 
factors, such as the size of purchases, transportation 
considerations, and geographic issues. The three types of 
pricing associated with the pricing of business products are 
geographic pricing, transfer pricing, and discounting.

Part 5   Marketing
When a trio of college friends with backgrounds in art and archi-
tecture started moving into their first apartments in the late 
1990s, they were frustrated to find that when it came to furni-
ture, they couldn’t afford what they liked and didn’t like what 
they could afford. Fortunately for many future furniture shop-
pers, however, this frustration led the three to found Blu Dot, a 
Minneapolis-based furniture design and manufacturing company 
that has flourished since its founding in 1997.
Blu Dot specializes in the creation of furniture that is attrac-
tive, high quality, and affordable. Its modern, streamlined pieces 
use off-the-shelf materials and simple manufacturing processes 
that keep the company’s costs and prices down. The company 
also contracts with suppliers that make industrial rather than 
consumer products, because these suppliers use more efficient 
and cost-effective processes and technology. These strategies, plus 
designs that pack flat and are easy to ship, allow the firm to com-
bine what Maurice Blanks, one of the founders, describes as the 
affordability of the low end of the market and the craftsmanship 
of the high end. Anyone can design a $600 or $700 coffee table, 
Blu Dot believes. It’s the $99 one the company is aiming for that’s 
more of a challenge.
The company sells seven product lines—tables, storage, acces-
sories, desks, beds, seating, and shelving. Its pricing strategy for 
each of these is straightforward. Managers add their fixed and 
variable costs, plus the markup they believe they’ll need to keep 
the business functioning. They then usually look at what competi-
tors are doing with similar products and try to identify three or 
four different pieces of pricing information to help them settle on 
a profitable price. The company also uses some creative pricing 
strategies to make its margins. For instance, one coffee table in 
a set might have a higher markup, whereas another has a slightly 
lower one for more price-conscious customers. Overall, then, the 
target margins are often met.
Blu Dot thinks of its total product offering as consisting of 
three interdependent elements: the core product, its supple-
mental features, and its symbolic or experiential value. Although 
some customers are attracted by the design aspects of the prod-
ucts, others are more concerned with value. That’s one reason 
the company recently introduced a separate brand, called +oo 
(“too”), and priced it slightly below the original Blu Dot line. 
These items have been marketed through Urban Outfitters, and 
Blu Dot has adjusted the prices over time after seeing how sales 
progressed. Co-founder John Christakos likens Blu Dot’s pricing 
practice to cooking, in that both are processes that allow for fine-
tuning as events develop.
In an interesting recent promotion that flirted with the price 
of zero, Blu Dot celebrated the opening of its new store in New 
York’s hip SoHo district by leaving 25 brand-new units of its 
iconic “Real Good Chair,” normally priced at $129, on various 
street corners in the city. Most of the chairs were equipped with 
GPS devices that allowed the company’s marketing agency to 
trace the chairs to those who “rescued” them and brought them 
home. The company’s Web site proclaims that all the chairs 
found good homes, and those “scavengers” who agreed to chat 
with the firm about its products received a second free chair in 
thank’s30
Questions
1.	 What challenges does Blu Dot face in selling consumer prod-
ucts (as opposed to business products)?
2.	 Do you think the product life-cycle is an important marketing 
concept in developing and managing Blu Dot products? Why 
or why not?
3.	 Describe the product mix and the role different product lines 
play in Blu Dot’s marketing strategy.

Gatorade, which single-handedly pioneered the sports drink more 
than 45 years ago, is making “G” the centerpiece of its brand-
ing efforts. The original Gatorade formula was developed by 
researchers at the University of Florida to help players on the col-
lege football team avoid dehydration. Other schools took notice 
of the Gators’ performance and soon began ordering batches of 
Gatorade for their athletes. One by one, Gatorade attracted the 
interest of professional football teams, and in 1983, it was named 
the National Football League’s official sports drink. That year, 
Gatorade was acquired by Quaker Oats and, in 2001, Quaker 
was, in turn, purchased by PepsiCo.
Throughout its history, Gatorade has remained the leader 
in sports drinks. However, in recent years, changes in customer 
behavior and increased competition have combined to take a toll 
on sales. First, increasingly health-conscious customers are seek-
ing out low-calorie, low-sodium beverages instead of traditional 
sports drinks. Second, PepsiCo’s main rival, Coca-Cola, has been 
powering up its marketing of Powerade sports drinks and winning 
over customers. As a result, Gatorade’s annual sales were stalled 
at around $5 billion, and its market share had fallen to 75 per-
cent, while Powerade’s market share shot up to 24 percent.
Case 13.2
Will the “G” Branding Initiatives 
for Gatorade Work?

Chapter 13   Creating and Pricing Products That Satisfy Customers	
391
Now Gatorade’s marketers are fighting for higher sales with 
new branding initiatives for specific target markets and redesigned 
packaging to grab customers’ attention. Both the Gatorade brand 
name and the lightning bolt brand mark have been fine-tuned to 
emphasize the G and the thunderbolt while downplaying the rest 
of the name. The goal is to make the combination instantly recog-
nizable as representing Gatorade, in much the same way that the 
Nike swoosh has become the iconic representation of that brand.
Gatorade is also introducing a series of G sports drinks target-
ing the specific needs of athletes. This is a change for Gatorade, 
which had for several years broadened its targeting and posi-
tioned the brand as a thirst-quencher for a cross-section of con-
sumers, not just athletes. Now the brand, under its revamped G 
branding, is going back to its sports roots with the G Series line 
of drink products for casual and serious athletes at a variety of 
experience levels.
Gatorade Prime 01 contains vitamins and other nutrients 
to help athletes “start strong.” Gatorade Perform 02 products 
include the original green Gatorade beverage for rehydration dur-
ing exertion plus a low-calorie drink, branded as G2. In addition, 
mix-your-own powdered versions of both Perform drinks are avail-
able. Gatorade Recover 03 is a special drink developed to replen-
ish energy and help muscles recover after any sports activity. The 
Elite Series of Gatorade drinks for athletes, more widely available 
than in the past, offers special formulations featuring protein, 
carbohydrates, and other nutritional enhancements.
Thanks to a new distribution arrangement, G Series Pro—once 
sold to professional athletes in gyms and locker rooms—can now 
be purchased at 5,500 GNC stores. “This line alone, reaching a 
new target audience, is going to be a killer,” comments GNC’s 
CEO. “We have consumers who are extremely passionate about 
what they [drink].” In another new deal, Gatorade is marketing 
its G Natural and G2 Natural low-calorie drinks through Whole 
Foods Market, which specializes in natural and organic foods.
Along with fine-tuning the brand and individual products, 
Gatorade is fine-tuning its packaging and labeling. For years, all 
bottles featured the full “Gatorade” brand name bisected by the 
brand’s stylized orange lightning bolt. Today, the G has taken 
center stage on container labels, with a small bolt within the  
G and a bolder bolt as the backdrop for the product name. 
Overall, the G Series packaging unifies the product line while 
allowing each item enough distinctive touches (such as different 
bottle shapes) to help customers quickly find the particular prod-
uct they want on crowded store shelves. The sophisticated new 
packaging also sets this line apart from the traditional Gatorade 
green-and-orange look, visually reinforcing the innovativeness of 
the G Series.
Gatorade’s advertising and promotional efforts, including 
a YouTube channel and Facebook fan page, carry through the 
focus on athleticism. Sports stars such as Serena Williams and 
Derek Jeter are featured, along with behind-the-scenes interviews 
with athletes getting ready for major sporting events. However, 
with Coca-Cola putting a big push behind its Powerade prod-
ucts, will Gatorade’s target market embrace the big G idea and 
gulp down enough G Series drinks to increase the brand’s mar-
ket share?31
Questions
1.	 What are the marketing advantages and disadvantages of 
emphasizing “G” as the primary element in the Gatorade 
brand?
2.	 As Gatorade sharpens its marketing focus on athletes, should 
it vary its packaging for different distribution channels or dif-
ferent sports? Explain your answer.
3.	 When they launch additional Gatorade brands, like Gatorade 
Prime 01 and Gatorade Recover 03, are Gatorade marketers 
introducing brand extensions, line extensions, or both?
1 	SOCIAL MEDIA EXERCISE
Creating and pricing products that satisfy customers
As one of the largest railway companies in the United States, 
Union Pacific has been around for nearly 150 years. Recently, 
they used crowdsourcing to create a competition that Union 
Pacific held to get people to vote on the ideal route for an old 
steam engine to take on the “Union Pacific Great Excursion 
Adventure.” Union Pacific split the voting into several rounds and 
saw fierce competition from unexpected locations. Smaller towns 
like Tuscola, IL, were routinely outpacing big metro markets like 
Chicago in each round. Sometimes the most passion can come 
from smaller communities for whom winning may be a bigger 
deal. Union Pacific recorded nearly 200,000 votes and more than 
100,000 email addresses across the campaign. The company 
plans to repeat the campaign next year.
1.	 Visit the Web site. At first you probably would not think of 
social media as being useful for a railroad. What do you think 
are the most effective elements of the campaign?
2.	 What can other non-competing companies learn from Union 
Pacific’s use of crowdsourcing?
2 	JOURNALING FOR SUCCESS

3 	DEVELOPING CRITICAL-THINKING SKILLS
A feature is a characteristic of a product or service that enables it 
to perform its function. Benefits are the results a person receives 
from using a product or service. For example, a toothpaste’s 
stain-removing formula is a feature; the benefit to the user is 
whiter teeth. Although features are valuable and enhance a 
product, benefits motivate people to buy. The customer is more 
interested in how the product can help (the benefits) than in the 
details of the product (the features).
Assignment
1.	 Choose a product and identify its features and benefits.
2.	 Divide a sheet of paper into two columns. In one column, list 
the features of the product. In the other column, list the ben-
efits each feature yields to the buyer.
3.	 Prepare a statement that would motivate you to buy this 
product.
4 	BUILDING TEAM SKILLS
In his book, The Post-Industrial Society, Peter Drucker wrote:
Society, community, and family are all conserving institu-
tions. They try to maintain stability and to prevent, or at 
least slow down, change. But the organization of the post-
capitalist society of organizations is a destabilizer. Because 
its function is to put knowledge to work—on tools, pro-
cesses, and products; on work; on knowledge itself—it must 
be organized for constant change. It must be organized for 
innovation.
New product development is important in this pro-
cess of systematically abandoning the past and building a 
future. Current customers can be sources of ideas for new 
products and services and ways of improving existing ones.
Assignment
1.	 Working in teams of five to seven, brainstorm ideas for new 
products or services for your college.
2.	 Construct questions to ask currently enrolled students (your 
customers). Sample questions might include:
	
a.  Why did you choose this college?
	
b.  How can this college be improved?
	
c.  What products or services do you wish were available?
3.	 Conduct the survey and review the results.
4.	 Prepare a list of improvements and/or new products or ser-
vices for your college.
5 	RESEARCHING DIFFERENT CAREERS
Standard & Poor’s Industry Surveys, designed for investors, provides 
insight into various industries and the companies that compete 
within those industries. The “Basic Analysis” section gives over-
views of industry trends and issues. The other sections define 
some basic industry terms, report the latest revenues and earnings 
of more than 1,000 companies, and occasionally list major refer-
ence books and trade associations.
Assignment
1.	 Identify an industry in which you might like to work.
2.	 Find the industry in Standard & Poor’s. (Note: Standard & Poor’s 
uses broad categories of industry. For example, an apparel or 
home-furnishings store would be included under “Retail” or 
“Textiles.”)
3.	 Identify the following:
a.	 Trends and issues in the industry
b.	 Opportunities and/or problems that might arise in the 
industry in the next five years
c.	 Major competitors within the industry (These companies 
are your potential employers.)
4.	 Prepare a report of your findings.

Through Distribution, Chobani Climbs to Number One
How can a brand zoom from startup to market leader in just four years? Greek yogurt 
maker Chobani had a delicious product, eye-catching packaging, and wallet-friendly pric-
ing. But the real fuel powering its meteoric rise was distribution.
CEO Hamdi Ulukaya got the idea for Chobani when he heard about a yogurt factory 
for sale near Utica, New York. Instead of the usual yogurt found in grocery stores and 
supermarkets across America, Ulukaya wanted to market a thick, tangy yogurt not well 
known to U.S. consumers. Fage, a yogurt imported from Greece, had this product category 
to itself—for the moment.
Ulukaya bought the factory and hired a yogurt expert. In 2007, after months of devel-
opment and testing, his Greek yogurt was ready for introduction, complete with a colorful 
label and a popular price. To get Chobani into the hands of as many consumers as pos-
sible, he decided to work with mainstream retailers rather than limit distribution to health-
food stores and specialty shops. “We went to the big chains and said we wanted to put it in 
the regular yogurt section,” Ulukaya remembers. Another key decision was to offer in-store 
samples so customers could taste the new product while shopping and buy that day.
Customers liked the yogurt so much that the first three stores to carry Chobani quickly 
sold out and reordered. Not long afterward, BJ’s Wholesale Club agreed to carry Chobani, 
followed by Costco, and a growing number of supermarkets across the Northeast. As 
Chobani added new flavors, retailers made more room on store shelves.
Competition soon crowded in. Fage opened a yogurt plant an hour’s drive from 
Chobani’s plant, deep in the heart of New York’s dairy belt. Both Dannon and Yoplait 
introduced Greek yogurt products to take advantage of the booming demand. Only four 
years after Chobani’s debut, it became the top brand in Greek yogurt, with 53 percent of 
the market, and it was the third-largest overall yogurt brand, thanks in large part to its 
distribution strategy. How long can Chobani maintain this fast-paced growth?1
FYI
Did You Know?
Chobani ships 2 million cases 
of Greek yogurt every week to 
stores across the United States.
Inside
Business
S
ome companies, like Chobani, use a particular approach to distribution and 
marketing channels that gives them a sustainable competitive advantage. More 
than 2 million firms in the United States help to move products from producers to 
consumers. Store chains such as Dollar General, Starbucks, Sears, and Walmart operate 
retail outlets where consumers make purchases. Some retailers, such as Avon Products 
and Amway, send their salespeople to the homes of customers. Still others, such as 
Amazon, sell exclusively online. Most retailers, however, utilize a mix of distribution 
channels, which may include retail stores, a Web site with online shopping, and catalogs.
In addition, there are more than half a million wholesalers that sell merchandise 
to other firms. Most consumers know little about these firms, which work “behind the 
scenes” and rarely sell directly to consumers. These and other intermediaries are con-
cerned with the transfer of both products and ownership. They thus help to create the 
time, place, and possession utilities that are critical to marketing. As we will see, they 
also perform a number of services for their suppliers and their customers.
In this chapter, we initially examine various channels of distribution that products 
follow as they move from producer to ultimate user. Then we discuss wholesalers and 
retailers within these channels. Next, we examine the types of shopping centers. Finally, 
we explore the physical distribution function and the major modes of transportation 
that are used to move goods.

Part 5   Marketing
Channels of Distribution
A channel of distribution, or marketing channel, is a sequence of marketing organizations 
that directs a product from the producer to the ultimate user. Every marketing channel 
begins with the producer and ends with either the consumer or the business user.
A marketing organization that links a producer and user within a marketing chan-
nel is called a middleman or marketing intermediary. For the most part, middlemen 
are concerned with the transfer of ownership of products. A merchant middleman (or, 
more simply, a merchant) is a middleman that actually takes title to products by buying 
them. A functional middleman, on the other hand, helps in the transfer of ownership 
of products but does not take title to the products.
Channels for Consumer Products
Different channels of distribution generally are used to move consumer and business 
products. The four most commonly used channels for consumer products are illustrated 
in Figure 14.1.
Producer to Consumer  This channel, often called the direct channel, includes no 
marketing intermediaries. Practically all services and a few consumer goods are dis-
tributed through a direct channel. Examples of marketers that sell goods directly to 
consumers include Dell Computer, Mary Kay Cosmetics, and Avon Products.
Producers sell directly to consumers for several reasons. They can better control 
the quality and price of their products. They do not have to pay (through discounts) for 
the services of intermediaries. They can maintain closer ties with customers.
Producer to Retailer to Consumer  A retailer is a middleman that buys from 
producers or other middlemen and sells to consumers. Producers sell directly to retail-
ers when retailers (such as Walmart) can buy in large quantities. This channel is used 
most often for products that are bulky, such as furniture and automobiles, for which 
additional handling would increase selling costs. It is also the usual channel for perish-
able products, such as fruits and vegetables, and for high-fashion products that must 
reach the consumer in the shortest possible time.
Producer to Wholesaler to Retailer to Consumer  This channel is known as the 
traditional channel because many consumer goods (especially convenience goods) pass 
through wholesalers to retailers. A wholesaler is a middleman that sells 
products to other firms. These firms may be retailers, industrial users, or 
other wholesalers. A producer uses wholesalers when its products are car-
ried by so many retailers that the producer cannot deal with all of them. 
For example, the maker of Wrigley’s gum uses this type of channel.
Producer to Agent to Wholesaler to Retailer to Consumer 
Producers may use agents to reach wholesalers. Agents are functional 
middlemen who do not take title to products and are compensated by 
commissions paid by producers. Often these products are inexpensive, 
frequently purchased items. For example, to reach a large number of 
potential customers, a small manufacturer of gas-powered lawn edgers 
might choose to use agents to market its product to wholesalers, which, 
in turn, sell the lawn edgers to a large number of retailers. This channel 
is also used for highly seasonal products (such as Christmas tree orna-
ments) and by producers that do not have their own sales forces.
Multiple Channels for Consumer Products
Often, a manufacturer uses different distribution channels to reach 
different market segments. A manufacturer uses multiple channels, 
for example, when the same product is sold to consumers and

Why Dell expanded its distribution channels. 
Computers are sold through several distribution 
channels.  At one time, Dell sold its computers only 
through direct distribution. In other words, the 
company sold them straight to consumers and not 
to retailers. However, competition forced Dell to 
add the producer/retailer/consumer channel.

business customers. Multiple channels are also used to increase sales or to capture 
a larger share of the market. With the goal of selling as much merchandise as 
possible, Firestone markets its tires through its own retail outlets as well as through 
independent dealers.
Channels for Business Products
Producers of business products generally tend to use short channels. We will outline the 
two that are used most commonly, which are illustrated in Figure 14.1.
Producer to Business User  In this direct channel, the manufacturer’s own sales 
force sells directly to business users. Heavy machinery, airplanes, and major equipment 
usually are distributed in this way. The very short channel allows the producer to pro-
vide customers with expert and timely services, such as delivery, machinery installation, 
and repairs.
Producer to Agent Middleman to Business User  Manufacturers use this chan-
nel to distribute such items as operating supplies, accessory equipment, small tools, and 
standardized parts. The agent is an independent intermediary between the producer 
and the user. Generally, agents represent sellers.
Level of Market Coverage
The level of market coverage refers to the number of wholesalers and the number of 
retailers that are used for a specific geographic area. There are three levels of market 
coverage: intensive distribution, selective distribution, and exclusive distribution. 
Explain the concept of market 
coverage.

Part 5   Marketing
Figure 14.2 shows examples of products that are likely 
to be distributed through each of these levels of market 
coverage.
Intensive distribution is the use of all avail-
able outlets for a product. The producer that wants 
to give its product the widest possible exposure in 
the marketplace chooses intensive distribution. The 
manufacturer saturates the market by selling to any 
intermediary of good financial standing that is will-
ing to stock and sell the product. For the consumer, 
intensive distribution means being able to shop at a con-
venient store and spend a minimum amount of time buying 
the product. Companies such as Procter & Gamble that pro-
duce consumer packaged items rely on intensive distribution 
for many of their products because consumers want ready 
availability.
Selective distribution is the use of only a portion of the 
available outlets for a product in each geographic area. For 
example, famed high-end clothing designer Missoni switched 
to selective distribution to make its style more affordable and 
accessible by designing a low cost ready-to-wear clothing line 
distributed through Target stores.2
Exclusive distribution is the use of only a single retail 
outlet for a product in a large geographic area. Exclusive dis-
tribution usually is limited to very prestigious products. The 
producer usually places many requirements (such as inventory 
levels, sales training, service quality, and warranty procedures) 
on exclusive dealers. For example, Patek Philippe watches, 
which may sell for $500,000 or more, are available in only a 
few select locations.

Partnering Through Supply-Chain 
Management
Supply-chain management is a long-term partnership among channel members 
working together to create a distribution system that reduces inefficiencies, costs, 
and redundancies while creating a competitive advantage and satisfying customers. 
Supply-chain management requires cooperation throughout the entire marketing 
channel, including manufacturing, research, sales, advertising, and shipping. Supply 
chains focus not only on producers, wholesalers, retailers, and customers but also 
on component-parts suppliers, shipping companies, communication companies, and 
other organizations that participate in product distribution. Suppliers are having a 
greater impact on determining what items retail stores carry. This phenomenon, called 
category management, is becoming common for mass merchandisers, supermarkets, 
and convenience stores. Through category management, the retailer asks a supplier in 
a particular category how to stock the shelves. Many retailers and suppliers claim this 
process delivers maximum efficiency.
Traditionally, buyers and sellers have been adversarial when negotiating 
purchases. Supply-chain management, however, encourages cooperation in 
reducing the costs of inventory, transportation, administration, and han-
dling; in speeding order-cycle times; and in increasing profits for all channel 
members. When buyers, sellers, marketing intermediaries, and facilitating 
agencies work together, customers’ needs regarding delivery, scheduling, 
packaging, and other requirements are better met.  Dunkin’ Brands, Inc., the 
parent company of Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin Robbins, recently signed 
a long-term supply chain deal with National DCP in order to improve its 
supply-chain management. NDCP will be the exclusive supply chain pro-
vider, handling distribution and procurement, for all Dunkin’ outlets in the 
continental United States. This deal will help Dunkin’ streamline its supply 
chain and provide greater service and product consistency across all of its 
outlets. This deal will also allow Dunkin’ Brands to offer uniform product 
costs to all of its franchisees in all U.S. markets.3
Technology has enhanced the implementation of supply-chain manage-
ment significantly. Through computerized integrated information sharing, 
channel members reduce costs and improve customer service. Technology 
has also allowed for more reciprocal relationships between supply-chain 
members. The major buyer is no longer necessarily in charge of making all 
the decisions, which get passed along to the suppliers. Today, all members of 
a supply chain play important roles in decision making regarding efficien-
cies and innovation.4
Vertical Marketing Systems
Vertical channel integration occurs when two or more stages of a distribution channel 
are combined and managed by one firm. A vertical marketing system (VMS) is a 
centrally managed distribution channel resulting from vertical channel integration. This 
merging eliminates the need for certain intermediaries. One member of a marketing 
channel may assume the responsibilities of another member, or it actually may purchase 
the operations of that member. Apple has utilized a vertical integration model for decades, 
and other companies such as Oracle, Motorola, and Amazon are following suit. Apple 
maintains control of much of the operations in its supply chain, including research, design, 
distribution, marketing, and selling. Apple also, of course, maintains centralized marketing 
control for the products it produces. While a VMS works well for Apple, many firms find 
that it is more efficient to remain specialized and to outsource nonessential activities.5 
Total vertical integration occurs when a single management controls all operations from 
production to final sale. Oil companies that own wells, transportation facilities, refineries, 
terminals, and service stations exemplify total vertical integration.

chain management facilitates

their brands. The manufacturers generally 
require their dealers to be located in different 
geographic areas so they don’t directly 
compete with one another.

Part 5   Marketing
There are three types of VMSs: administered, contractual, and corporate. In an 
administered VMS, one of the channel members dominates the other members, perhaps 
because of its large size. Under its influence, the channel members collaborate on produc-
tion and distribution. A powerful manufacturer, such as Procter & Gamble, receives a 
great deal of cooperation from intermediaries that carry its brands. Although the goals of 
the entire system are considered when decisions are made, control rests with individual 
channel members, as in conventional marketing channels. Under a contractual VMS, 
cooperative arrangements and the rights and obligations of channel members are defined 
by contracts or other legal measures. In a corporate VMS, actual ownership is the vehicle 
by which production and distribution are joined. For example, The Limited established 
a corporate VMS that operates corporate-owned production facilities and retail stores. 
Most VMSs are organized to improve distribution by combining individual operations.
Marketing Intermediaries: Wholesalers
Wholesalers may be the most misunderstood of marketing intermediaries. Producers 
sometimes try to eliminate them from distribution channels by dealing directly with 
retailers or consumers. Yet wholesalers provide a variety of essential marketing services. 
Although wholesalers can be eliminated, their functions cannot be eliminated. These 
functions must be performed by other channel members or by consumers. Eliminating 
a wholesaler may or may not cut distribution costs.
Justifications for Marketing Intermediaries
The press, consumers, public officials, and other marketers often charge wholesalers, at least 
in principle, with inefficiency and parasitism. Consumers in particular feel strongly that the 
distribution channel should be made as short as possible. They assume that the fewer the 
intermediaries in a distribution channel, the lower the price of the product will be.
Those who believe that the elimination of wholesalers will bring about lower 
prices, however, do not recognize that the services wholesalers perform are still needed. 
Those services simply are provided by other means, and consumers still bear the costs. 
Moreover, all manufacturers operating without wholesalers would have to keep exten-
sive records and employ enough personnel to deal with a multitude of retailers indi-
vidually. Even with direct distribution, products might be considerably more expensive 
because prices would reflect the costs of producers’ inefficiencies. Figure 14.3 shows

that 16 contacts could result from the efforts of four buyers purchasing the products 
of four producers. With the assistance of an intermediary, only eight contacts would 
be necessary.
To illustrate further the useful role of wholesalers in the marketing system, assume 
that all wholesalers in the candy industry were abolished. With thousands of candy 
retailers to contact, candy manufacturers would be making an extremely large number 
of sales calls just to maintain the present level of product visibility. Hershey Foods, 
for example, would have to set up warehouses all over the country, organize a fleet of 
trucks, purchase and maintain thousands of vending machines, and deliver all of its 
own candy. Sales and distribution costs for candy would soar. Candy producers would 
be contacting and shipping products to thousands of small businesses instead of to a 
limited number of large wholesalers and retailers. The outrageous costs of this inef-
ficiency would be passed on to consumers. Candy bars would be more expensive and 
likely available through fewer retailers.
Wholesalers’ Services to Retailers
Wholesalers help retailers by buying in large quantities and then selling to retailers 
in smaller quantities and by delivering goods to retailers. They also stock—in one 
place—the variety of goods that retailers otherwise would have to buy from many 
producers. Wholesalers provide assistance in three other vital areas: promotion, market 
information, and financial aid.
Promotion  Some wholesalers help to promote the products they sell to retailers. 
These services are usually either free or performed at cost. Wholesalers, for example, 
are major sources of display materials designed to stimulate impulse buying. They 
also may help retailers to build effective window, counter, and shelf displays. Some 
may even assign their own employees to work on the retail sales floor during special 
promotions.
Market Information  Wholesalers are a constant source of market information. 
Wholesalers have numerous contacts with local businesses and distant suppliers. In 
the course of these dealings, they accumulate information about consumer demand, 
prices, supply conditions, new developments within the trade, and even industry 
personnel. This information may be relayed to retailers informally though the whole-
saler’s sales force. Wholesalers often provide information to their customers via Web 
site, which helps improve transparency and communication between buyers and 
sellers.
Information regarding industry sales and competitive prices is especially important 
to all firms. Dealing with a number of suppliers and many retailers, a wholesaler is 
a natural clearinghouse for such information. Most wholesalers are willing to pass 
information on to their customers.
Financial Aid  Most wholesalers provide a type of financial aid that retailers often 
take for granted. By making prompt and frequent deliveries, wholesalers enable retail-
ers to keep their own inventory investments small in relation to sales. Such indirect 
financial aid reduces the amount of operating capital that retailers need.
Wholesalers’ Services to Manufacturers
Some of the services that wholesalers perform for producers are similar to those they 
provide to retailers. Others are quite different.
Providing an Instant Sales Force  A wholesaler provides its producers with an 
instant sales force so that producers’ sales representatives need not call on retailers. This 
can result in enormous savings for producers. For example, Lever Brothers and General 
Foods would have to spend millions of dollars each year to field a sales force large

Part 5   Marketing
enough to call on all the retailers that sell their numerous products. Instead, these pro-
ducers rely on wholesalers to sell and distribute their products to many retailers. These 
producers do have sales forces, though, that call on wholesalers and large retailers.
Reducing Inventory Costs  Wholesalers purchase goods in sizable quantities from 
manufacturers and store these goods for resale. By doing so, they reduce the amount 
of finished-goods inventory that producers must hold and thereby reduce the cost of 
carrying inventories.
Assuming Credit Risks  When producers sell through wholesalers, it is the whole-
salers who extend credit to retailers, make collections from retailers, and assume the 
risks of non-payment. These services reduce the producers’ cost of extending credit to 
customers and the resulting bad-debt expense.
Furnishing Market Information  Just as they do for retailers, wholesalers supply ­market 
information to the producers they serve. Valuable information accumulated by wholesalers 
may concern consumer demand, the producers’ competition, and buying trends.
Types of Wholesalers
Wholesalers generally fall into three categories: merchant wholesalers; commission 
merchants, agents, and brokers; and manufacturers’ sales branches and sales offices. 
Of these, merchant wholesalers constitute the largest portion. They account for about 
four-fifths of all wholesale establishments and employees.
Merchant Wholesalers
A merchant wholesaler is a middleman that purchases goods in large quantities 
and then sells them to other wholesalers or retailers and to institutional, farm, 
government, professional, or industrial users. Merchant wholesalers usually operate 
one or more warehouses at which they receive, take title to, and 
store goods. These wholesalers are sometimes called distributors 
or jobbers.
Most merchant wholesalers are businesses composed of sales-
people, order takers, receiving and shipping clerks, inventory man-
agers, and office personnel. Houston Wire & Cable Company, for 
instance, is a major wholesaler of wire and cables for energy, utili-
ties, construction, and industrial markets. The company offers a 
wide variety of cables in its warehouses to satisfy customer needs. 
It also offers services to customers, such as same-day shipping, 
training programs, assistance with product selection, and asset 
management assistance.6 The successful merchant wholesaler must 
analyze available products and market needs. It must be able to 
adapt the type, variety, and quality of its products to changing 
market conditions.
Merchant wholesalers may be classified as full-service or 
limited-service wholesalers, depending on the number of services 
they provide. A full-service wholesaler performs the entire 
range of wholesaler functions described earlier in this section. 
These functions include delivering goods, supplying, warehous-
ing, arranging for credit, supporting promotional activities, and 
providing general customer assistance.
Under this broad heading are the general-merchandise whole-
saler, limited-line wholesaler, and specialty-line wholesaler. A 
­general-merchandise wholesaler deals in a wide variety of products,

Wholesalers facilitate trade by connecting 
manufacturers with retailers. A general-
merchandise wholesaler buys many types of products 
from a broad range of manufacturers, warehouses 
the products, and then sells them to retailers. So, 
instead of having to contact hundreds of different 
manufacturers to stock their shelves, retailers need to 
contact only a small number of wholesalers.

ited-line wholesaler stocks only a few product lines but carries numerous product items 
within each line. A specialty-line wholesaler carries a select group of products within 
a single line. Food delicacies such as shellfish represent the kind of product handled by 
this type of wholesaler.
In contrast to a full-service wholesaler, a limited-service wholesaler assumes 
responsibility for a few wholesale services only. Other marketing tasks are left to other 
channel members or consumers. This category includes cash-and-carry wholesalers, 
truck wholesalers, drop shippers, and mail-order wholesalers.
Commission Merchants, Agents, and Brokers
Commission merchants, agents, and brokers are functional middlemen. Functional 
middlemen do not take title to products. They perform a small number of marketing 
activities and are paid a commission that is a percentage of the sales price.
A commission merchant usually carries merchandise and negotiates sales for 
manufacturers. In most cases, commission merchants have the power to set the prices 
and terms of sales. After a sale is made, they either arrange for delivery or provide 
transportation services.
An agent is a middleman that expedites exchanges, represents a buyer or a seller, 
and often is hired permanently on a commission basis. When agents represent produc-
ers, they are known as sales agents or manufacturer’s agents. As long as the products 
represented do not compete, a sales agent may represent one or several manufacturers 
on a commission basis. The agent solicits orders for the manufacturers within a spe-
cific territory. As a rule, the manufacturers ship the merchandise and bill the customers 
directly. The manufacturers also set the prices and other conditions of the sales. What 
do the manufacturers gain by using a sales agent? The sales agent provides immedi-
ate entry into a territory, regular calls on customers, selling experience, and a known, 
predetermined selling expense (a commission that is a percentage of sales revenue).
A broker is a middleman that specializes in a particular commodity, represents 
either a buyer or a seller, and is likely to be hired on a temporary basis. However, food 
brokers, which sell grocery products to resellers, generally have long-term relationships 
with their clients. Brokers may perform only the selling function, or both buying and 
selling, using established contacts or special knowledge of their fields.
Manufacturers’ Sales Branches and Sales Offices
A manufacturer’s sales branch is, in essence, a merchant wholesaler that is owned 
by a manufacturer. Sales branches carry inventory, extend credit, deliver goods, and 
offer help in promoting products. Their customers are retailers, other wholesalers, and 
industrial purchasers.
Because sales branches are owned by producers, they stock primarily the goods 
manufactured by their own firms. Selling policies and terms usually are established 
centrally and then transmitted to branch managers for implementation.
A manufacturer’s sales office is essentially a sales agent owned by a manufac-
turer. Sales offices may sell goods manufactured by their own firms as well as cer-
tain products of other manufacturers that complement their own product lines. For 
example, Hiram Walker & Sons imports wine from Spain to increase the number of 
products its sales offices can offer to customers.
Marketing Intermediaries: Retailers
Retailers are the final link between producers and consumers. Retailers may buy 
from either wholesalers or producers. They sell not only goods but also such services 
as auto repairs, haircuts, and dry cleaning. Some retailers sell both. Sears, Roebuck 
and Company sells consumer goods, financial services, and repair services for home 
appliances bought at Sears.

types of retailers.

Part 5   Marketing
According to the most recent census data, there are over 1 mil-
lion retail establishments in the United States. Just over half of these 
have fewer than ten employees. On the other hand, some large retail 
organizations have thousands of employees and bring in millions of 
dollars in revenues.7 Table 14.1 lists the ten largest retail organiza-
tions and their approximate sales revenues and yearly profits.
Classes of In-Store Retailers
One way to classify retailers is by the number of stores owned and 
operated by the firm. An independent retailer is a firm that operates 
only one retail outlet. Approximately three-fourths of retailers are 
independent. One-store operators, like all small businesses, generally 
provide personal service and a convenient location.
A chain retailer is a company that operates more than one 
retail outlet. By adding outlets, chain retailers attempt to reach new 
geographic markets. As sales increase, chains usually buy merchan-
dise in larger quantities and thus take advantage of quantity dis-
counts. They also wield more power in their dealings with suppliers. 
About one-fourth of retail organizations operate chains.
Another way to classify in-store retailers is by store size and 
the kind and number of products carried. Let’s take a closer look at 
store types based on these dimensions.
Department Stores  These large retail establishments consist of 
several sections, or departments, that sell a wide assortment of prod-
ucts. According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, a department store 
is a retail store that (1) employs 25 or more persons and (2) sells at least 
home furnishings, appliances, family apparel, and household linens 
and dry goods, each in a different part of the store. Macy’s, Harrods 
in London, and Au Printemps in Paris are examples of large depart-
ment stores. Sears, Roebuck and JCPenney are also department stores. 
Traditionally, department stores have been service oriented along with 
the goods they sell, these retailers provide credit, delivery, personal 
assistance, liberal return policies, and pleasant shopping atmospheres.
Discount Stores  A discount store is a self-service general-merchandise outlet that 
sells products at lower-than-usual prices. These stores can offer lower prices by operat-
ing on smaller markups, by locating large retail showrooms in low-rent areas, and by 
offering minimal customer services. To keep prices low, discount stores operate on the 
basic principle of high turnover of such items as appliances, toys, clothing, automotive 
products, and sports equipment. To attract customers, many discount stores also offer 
some food and household items at low prices. Popular discount stores include Kmart, 
Walmart, Dollar General, and Target.
As competition among discount stores has increased, some discounters have 
improved their services, store environments, and locations. As a consequence, many 
of the better-known discount stores have assumed the characteristics of department 
stores. This upgrading has boosted their prices and blurred the distinction between 
some discount stores and department stores.
Catalog and Warehouse Showrooms  A catalog showroom is a retail outlet 
that displays well-known brands and sells them at discount prices through catalogs 
within the store. Colorful catalogs are available in the showroom (and sometimes by 
mail). The ­customer selects the merchandise, either from the catalog or from the show-
room display. The customer fills out an order form provided by the store and hands 
the form to a clerk. The clerk retrieves the merchandise from a warehouse room that 
is adjacent to the selling area.
independent retailer  a firm that 
operates only one retail outlet
chain retailer  a company that 
operates more than one retail 
outlet
department store  a retail store 
that (1) employs 25 or more 
persons and (2) sells at least home 
furnishings, appliances, family 
apparel, and household linens and 
dry goods, each in a different part 
of the store
discount store  a self-service 
general-merchandise outlet that 
sells products at lower-than-usual 
prices
catalog showroom  a retail outlet 
that displays well-known brands 
and sells them at discount prices 
through catalogs within the store
Accessing customers through different types of 
retailers. When people are asked to name a retailer, 
they often think of brick-and-mortar establishments 
like the ones shown in this photo. However, retailing 
goes on in all kinds of places, including in people’s 
homes and workplaces, online, over the phone and 
on TV, and even on the streets.

Small Business Saturday, a Day to Shop Local
Entrepreneurial
Success
© elnur/Shutterstock
Small Business Saturday has one goal: To 
encourage U.S. consumers to “shop small” 
on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. Initiated 
in 2010 by American Express and now repeated 
annually, Small Business Saturday seeks to bring 
customers to independent stores on one of the year’s busiest 
shopping weekends. American Express helps small retailers get 
the word out through downloadable, customizable marketing 
materials for in-store and online use. As an incentive for 
shoppers, the financial services firm offers a $25 credit to 
cardholders who buy from local businesses on that Saturday.
Year after year, Small Business Saturday has become increasingly 
successful, giving small stores a revenue boost while contributing 
to local economies across the country. Hundreds of organizations 
(such as the Small Business Administration, FedEx, Facebook, and 
multiple cities and chambers of commerce) support the event, 
adding their promotional efforts to American Express’s official 
Small Business Saturday advertising and social media marketing.
More than 100 million U.S. shoppers now participate in Small 
Business Saturday, and entrepreneurs say they’re serving more 
customers and new customers as a result. “It was heartening 
to see so many new faces on Saturday,” observed a book store 
owner. “People actually thought about what small business to 
go to and were happy to let us know they’d chosen us.”

A warehouse showroom is a retail facility with five basic characteristics: (1) a 
large, low-cost building; (2) warehouse materials-handling technology; (3) vertical 
merchandise displays; (4) a large on-premises inventory; and (5) minimal service. Some 
of the best-known showrooms are operated by big furniture retailers. These operations 
employ few personnel and offer few services. Most customers carry away purchases 
in the manufacturer’s carton, although some warehouse showrooms will deliver for a 
fee. The Plumbing Warehouse is a warehouse showroom where contractors and do-it-
yourself customers can browse a wide variety of bath and kitchen fixtures and shop 
for their needs.8
Convenience Stores  A convenience store is a small food store that sells a limited 
variety of products but remains open well beyond normal business hours. Almost 70

store that sells primarily food and 
household products

that carries not only food and 
nonfood products ordinarily 
found in supermarkets but also 
additional product lines

mix with deep product lines
percent of convenience store customers live within a mile of the store. White Hen 
Pantry, 7-Eleven, Circle K, and Open Pantry stores, for example, are found in some 
areas, as are independent convenience stores. There are over 118,000 convenience 
stores in the United States.9 Their limited product mixes and higher prices keep conve-
nience stores from becoming a major threat to other grocery retailers.
Supermarkets  A supermarket is a large self-service store that sells primarily food 
and household products. It stocks canned, fresh, frozen, and processed foods; paper 
products; and cleaning supplies. Supermarkets also may sell such items as housewares, 
toiletries, toys and games, drugs, stationery, books and magazines, plants and flowers, 
and a few clothing items.
Supermarkets are large-scale operations that emphasize low prices and one-stop 
shopping for household needs. A supermarket has annual sales of at least $2 million 
per store. Current top-ranking supermarkets include Kroger, Albertson’s, Safeway, and 
Winn-Dixie. Many traditional supermarket chains have experienced shrinking profit 
margins and are finding it difficult to compete with superstores, such as Walmart 
Supercenters or Super Targets, which stock the same items as supermarkets, in addition 
to a wide variety of other items.
Superstores  A superstore is a large retail store that carries not only food and 
nonfood products ordinarily found in supermarkets but also additional product lines—
housewares, hardware, small appliances, clothing, personal-care products, garden 
products, and automotive merchandise. Superstores also provide a number of services 
to entice customers. Typically, these include automotive repair, snack bars and restau-
rants, film developing, and banking.
Warehouse Clubs  The warehouse club is a large-scale members-only establish-
ment that combines features of cash-and-carry wholesaling with discount retailing. For 
an annual fee, small retailers may purchase products at wholesale prices for business 
use or for resale. Warehouse clubs also sell to ultimate consumers.
Warehouse clubs offer the same types of products offered by discount stores but 
in a limited range of sizes and styles. Because their product lines are shallow and sales 
volumes are high, warehouse clubs can offer a broad range of merchandise, including 
perishable and nonperishable foods, beverages, books, appliances, housewares, auto-
motive parts, hardware, furniture, and sundries. The sales volume of most warehouse 
clubs is four to five times that of a typical department store. Warehouse clubs are 
characterized by high inventory turnover rates, meaning they often 
sell their goods before manufacturers’ payment periods are up. This 
reduces warehouse clubs’ need for capital.
To keep their prices lower than those of supermarkets and dis-
count stores, warehouse clubs provide few services. They gener-
ally advertise only through direct mail. Their facilities often have 
concrete floors and aisles wide enough for forklifts. Merchandise 
is stacked on pallets or displayed on pipe racks. Usually cus-
tomers must transport purchases themselves. Although at one 
time there were about 20 competing warehouse clubs, only two 
major competitors remain: Sam’s Club and Costco. These ware-
house clubs stock about 4,000 items (usually in bulk packaging), 
including office supplies, food, electronics, jewelry, clothes, and 
appliances. Costco leads the warehouse club industry with sales 
of $88.9 billion and Sam’s Club is second with $46.7 billion in 
store sales.10
Traditional Specialty Stores  A traditional specialty store 
carries a narrow product mix with deep product lines. Traditional 
specialty stores are sometimes called limited-line retailers. If they 
Are you a member of one of these clubs? 
Warehouse clubs charge small businesses and 
consumers an annual fee that allows them to buy 
products in bulk at discount prices. Sam’s is an 
example of a warehouse club.  So is Costco.

off-price retailer  a store that 
buys manufacturers’ seconds, 
overruns, returns, and off-
season merchandise for resale to 
consumers at deep discounts

specialty store that concentrates 
on a single product line and 
competes on the basis of low 
prices and product availability

retailing whereby consumers

a store

products to customers through

home or in the workplace
carry depth in one particular product category, they may be called 
singleline retailers. Specialty stores usually sell such products as cloth-
ing, jewelry, sporting goods, fabrics, computers, flowers, baked goods, 
books, and pet supplies. Examples of specialty stores include Gap 
Inc., Radio Shack, Bath and Body Works, and Foot Locker.
Specialty stores usually offer deeper product mixes than department 
stores. They attract customers by emphasizing service, atmosphere, and 
location. Consumers who are dissatisfied with the impersonal atmo-
sphere of large retailers often find the attention offered by small spe-
cialty stores appealing.
Off-Price Retailers  An off-price retailer is a store that buys 
manufacturers’ seconds, overruns, returns, and off-season merchan-
dise at below-wholesale prices and sells them to consumers at deep 
discounts. Off-price retailers sell limited lines of national-brand 
and designer merchandise, usually clothing, shoes, or housewares. 
Examples of off-price retailers include T.J.Maxx, Burlington Coat 
Factory, and Marshalls. Off-price stores charge up to 50 percent less 
than department stores do for comparable merchandise but offer few 
customer services. They often include community dressing rooms and 
central checkout counters, and some off-price retailers have a policy 
against returns and exchanges.
Category Killers  A category killer is a very large specialty store that concentrates 
on a single product line and competes by offering low prices and an enormous number 
of products. These stores are called category killers because they take business away 
from smaller, high-cost retail stores. Examples of category killers include Home Depot 
(building materials), Office Depot (office supplies and equipment), and Best Buy (elec-
tronics), all of which are leaders in their niche. Toys“R”Us, one of the original category 
killers, has a bleak future; the inability to maintain high sales year round with a market 
that focuses on the holidays has had its effect on the toy retailer. Many category killers, 
including Toys“R”Us, are experiencing lower sales as they struggle to compete with 
Walmart, the world’s number-one retailer, which can price goods below cost and easily 
shift the concentration of different categories of goods in its stores depending on the 
store’s location and the time of the year. 11
Kinds of Nonstore Retailing
Nonstore retailing is selling that does not take place in conventional store facilities; 
consumers purchase products without visiting a store. This form of retailing accounts 
for an increasing percentage of total retail sales. Nonstore retailers use direct selling, 
direct marketing, and vending machines.
Direct Selling  Direct selling is the marketing of products to customers through 
face-to-face sales presentations at home or in the workplace. Traditionally called 
door-to-door selling, direct selling in the United States began with peddlers more than 
a century ago and has since grown into a sizable industry that generates about $28.5 
billion in U.S. sales annually.12 Instead of the door-to-door approach, many com-
panies today—such as Mary Kay, Kirby, Amway, and Avon—use other approaches. 
They identify customers by mail, telephone, the Internet, or at shopping malls and 
then set up appointments. Direct selling sometimes involves the “party plan,” which 
can occur in the customer’s home or workplace. One customer will act as a host 
and invite friends and co-workers to view merchandise in a group setting where 
the salesperson demonstrates the products. Direct selling through the party plan 
requires effective salespeople who can identify potential hosts and provide encour-
agement and incentives for them to organize a gathering of friends and associates. 
To specialize or not to specialize—that is the 
question. A traditional specialty store carries one 
product line in considerable depth.  Foot Locker 
is a traditional specialty store. Why might you 
shop there rather than at a department store that 
sells athletic shoes? Do specialty stores face any 
disadvantages? If so, what?

Part 5   Marketing
direct marketing  the use of 
the telephone, Internet, and 
nonpersonal media to introduce 
products to customers, who can 
then purchase them via mail, 
telephone, or the Internet
catalog marketing  a type 
of marketing in which an 
organization provides a catalog 
from which customers make 
selections and place orders by 
mail, telephone, or the Internet
Companies that commonly use the party plan are Tupperware, Stanley 
Home Products, Pampered Chef, and Sarah Coventry. Mary Kay also 
uses the party plan by holding group pajama parties, makeovers, and 
girls’ nights out.
Direct selling has both benefits and limitations. It gives the marketer 
an opportunity to demonstrate the product in an environment—usually 
customers’ homes—where it most likely would be used. Some companies, 
such as Kirby Vacuums, will even clean the carpet in your home while 
they demonstrate their product. The direct seller can give the customer 
personal attention, and the product can be presented to the customer 
at a convenient time and location. Personal attention to the customer is 
the foundation on which some direct sellers have built their businesses. 
For example, your Mary Kay salesperson can recommend beauty and 
skin products tailored to your specific needs. Because commissions are so 
high, ranging from 30 to 50 percent of the sales price, and great effort is 
required to isolate promising prospects, overall costs of direct selling make 
it a very expensive form of retailing.
Direct Marketing  Direct marketing is the use of the telephone, 
Internet, and nonpersonal media to communicate product and organi-
zational information to customers, who can then purchase products via 
mail, telephone, or the Internet. Direct marketing is one type of nonstore 
retailing. Direct marketing can occur through catalog marketing, direct-response mar-
keting, telemarketing, television home shopping, and online marketing.
In catalog marketing, an organization provides a catalog from which customers 
make selections and place orders by mail, telephone, or the Internet. Catalog market-
ing began in 1872, when Montgomery Ward issued its first catalog to rural families. 
Today, there are more than 7,000 catalog marketing companies in the United States, 
as well as a number of retail stores, such as Chico’s, that engage in catalog marketing. 
Some organizations, including Spiegel, offer a broad array of products spread over 
multiple product lines. JCPenney historically has used a similar approach. However, 
JCPenney recently revamped its catalog strategy, doing away with “The Big Book,” a 
1,000-page catalog, and replacing it with smaller specialty catalogs.13 Catalog compa-
nies, such as Burpee and Newport News, offer considerable depth in one major line of 
products. Still other catalog companies specialize in only a few products within a single 
line. Many catalog companies increasingly rely on their Web sites, 
which are cheaper to produce, maintain, and distribute, and allow 
organizations to be more responsive in terms of displaying only the 
inventory that is available.
Catalog marketing has both advantages and disadvantages. 
The advantages of catalog marketing include efficiency and conve-
nience for customers. The retailer benefits by being able to locate 
in remote, low-cost areas; save on expensive store fixtures; and 
reduce both personal selling and store operating expenses. On the 
other hand, catalog marketing is inflexible, provides limited ser-
vice, and is most effective for only a selected set of products.
Direct-response marketing occurs when a seller adver-
tises a product and makes it available, usually for a short time 
period, through mail, telephone, or online orders. Examples of 
direct-response marketing include a television commercial offering 
a recording artist’s musical collection, or a newspaper or maga-
zine advertisement for a series of children’s books. The marketing 
method has resulted in some products gaining widespread popular-
ity. Most people have probably heard of the Shake Weight, Snuggie, 
and Magic Bullet—which all became popular because of direct 
Killing the competition? Or not? Office Depot 
is an example of a category killer. Category killers 
aren’t likely to annihilate all of the competition 
though. Small retailers with less product variety 
and higher prices have found it difficult to compete 
against category killers. However, small retailers 
that carry a smaller inventory of products that are 
different from those stocked by category killers 
and compete on the basis of service, rather than 
price, can survive.

Utilizing multiple retail approaches. Many retailers 
use multiple marketing strategies to reach potential 
customers. Crate & Barrel operates over 160 retail 
stores. It also engages in direct marketing through 
catalog and online retailing.

direct-response marketing  a 
type of marketing in which a seller 
advertises a product and makes it

period, through mail, telephone, 
or online orders
telemarketing  the performance 
of marketing-related activities by 
telephone

form of selling in which products

response television marketing campaigns. The Snuggie 
was so popular that it even spawned a competitor, the 
Slanket.
Telemarketing is the performance of marketing-
related activities by telephone. Some organizations use 
a prescreened list of prospective clients. Telemarketing 
can help generate sales leads, improve customer service, 
speed up payments on past-due accounts, raise funds for 
non-profit organizations, and gather marketing data.
The laws and regulations regarding telemarketing 
have become more restrictive over time. Several states have 
do-not-call registries of customers who do not wish to receive 
telemarketing calls. In 2003, U.S. Congress implemented a 
national do-not-call registry, which has more than 200 mil-
lion numbers on it. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 
enforces violations; and companies are subject to fines of up 
to $16,000 for each call made to numbers on the list. Recently, 
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) created a 
regulation that restricts the use of prerecorded messages to 
make telemarketing calls. Companies are no longer allowed 
to call customers simply because they had done business in 
the past. The law also requires that an “opt-out” mechanism 
be embedded in the call for consumers who do not wish to 
receive the calls. Recently, unwanted telecommunications calls 
and texts were top consumer complaints, spurring passage of 
stricter regulations. Companies that are still allowed to make 
telemarketing phone calls must pay for access to the do-not-call registry and must 
obtain updated numbers from the registry at least every three days.
Certain exceptions apply to no-call lists. A company can still use telemarketing to 
communicate with existing customers. In addition, charitable, political, and telephone 
survey organizations are not restricted by the national registry.14
Television home shopping presents products to television viewers, encouraging 
them to order through toll-free numbers and pay with credit cards. Television home 
shopping typically sells products such as jewelry, the highest-selling product category, 
clothing, housewares, and electronics. With the growing popularity of this medium, 
new channels are being added, even ones that specialize in one specific product cat-
egory, such as Jewelry Television. Approximately 60 percent of home shopping sales 
revenues come from repeat purchasers.
The television home shopping format offers several benefits. Products can be 
demonstrated easily, and an adequate amount of time can be spent showing the 
product so as to make viewers well informed. The length of time a product is shown 
depends not only on the time required for doing the demonstration but also on 
whether the product is selling. Once the calls peak and begin to decline, a new prod-
uct is shown.
Online retailing makes products available to buyers through computer con-
nections. Most brick-and-mortar retailers have Web sites to sell products, provide 
information about their company, or distribute coupons. Consumers can also bid on 
anything from concert tickets, automobiles, or even a wedge of cheese shaped like 
Elvis on eBay. Online movie providers like Netflix have made it easier than ever for 
consumers to access the entertainment they want. Consumers can now conduct nearly 
all their financial activities online, including trade stocks, set up retirement accounts, 
and interact with brokerage firms. Online retailing has continued to rise, even affecting 
when people shop. Cyber Monday, which is the Monday after Thanksgiving, is also an 
increasingly important shopping day. Cyber Monday sales in 2011 skyrocketed 22% 
over the previous year. It was the single largest online shopping day in U.S. history, and 
the popularity of Cyber Monday is bound to increase in years to come.15

Part 5   Marketing
Automatic Vending  Automatic vending is the use of machines to dispense prod-
ucts. It accounts for less than 2 percent of all retail sales. Automatic vending is one 
of the most impersonal forms of retailing. Small, standardized, routinely purchased 
products (e.g., chewing gum, candy, newspapers, cigarettes, soft drinks, and cof-
fee) can be sold in machines because consumers usually buy them at the nearest 
available location. Vending machines in recent years have taken on a kind of cult 
popularity among urban-dwelling consumers. Now customers can find a wide vari-
ety of products dispensed via vending machine, even high-end items. For example, 
the Semi-Automatic machine, located in luxury hotels, dispenses such items as 
$500 watches and $22 eye cream to travelers who may have forgotten items at 
home. InstyMeds vending machines dispense prescription medications to custom-
ers. Fishermen in Pennsylvania can even buy live bait via PA Live Bait Vending.16 
Machines in areas with heavy foot traffic provide efficient and continuous service 
to consumers.
Since vending machines need only a small amount of space and no sales person-
nel, this retailing method has some advantages over stores. These advantages are 
partly offset, however, by the high costs of equipment and frequent servicing and 
repairs.
Planned Shopping Centers
The planned shopping center is a self-contained retail facility constructed by inde-
pendent owners and consisting of various stores. Shopping centers are designed and 
promoted to serve diverse groups of customers with widely differing needs. The man-
agement of a shopping center strives for a coordinated mix of stores, a comfortable 
atmosphere, adequate parking, pleasant landscaping, and special events to attract cus-
tomers. The convenience of meeting most family and household shopping needs in a 
single location is an important part of shopping-center appeal.
Next-Generation Vending Machines
The next generation of vending machines is 
on the way, wired with the latest technology 
for a fast, convenient, and fun experience. 
Craving a cupcake in the middle of the night? 
Head to one of the 24-hour high-tech vending machines 
outside a Sprinkles bakery. Slide your credit or debit card 
into the slot, decide on one of the 600 cupcakes—baked 
fresh throughout the day—and watch a robotic arm carefully 
dispense a small box with your ready-to-eat treat.
If you’re thirsty, you can choose from 125 different 
flavors of soft drinks and other beverages at Coca-Cola’s 
touch-screen Freestyle vending machines or use a Freestyle 
app to mix your own flavor combination. These machines are 
networked to Coca-Cola’s computer system so its marketers 
can analyze the most popular flavors by time of day and point 
of purchase.
Finally, for sheer entertainment, it’s hard to beat the Lay’s 
vending machine in Buenos Aires. Drop a raw potato down 
the shoot, and see it get washed, peeled, cut, cooked, salted, 
and bagged before a package of potato chips pops out of the 
machine. In reality, what customers see is a vivid one-minute 
video reinforcing the idea that Lay’s chips are made from real 
potatoes.

There are four types of planned shopping centers: lifestyle, neighborhood, com-
munity, or regional. Although shopping centers vary, each offers a complementary mix 
of stores for the purpose of generating consumer traffic.
Lifestyle Shopping Centers
A lifestyle shopping center is a shopping center that has an open-air configuration 
and is occupied by upscale national chain specialty stores. The lifestyle center is more 
convenient than a traditional enclosed mall and offers the same quality of upscale 
retail, department stores, movie theaters, and dining. The lifestyle shopping model has 
grown in popularity around the world because it combines shopping with the feel of 
being in a town and allows consumers to stroll around outside, as they would have 
done on Main Street a generation ago. Some lifestyle shopping centers incorporate 
activities, sports, and culture into their design in order to encourage customers to linger 
longer.17
Neighborhood Shopping Centers
A neighborhood shopping center typically consists of several small convenience 
and specialty stores. Businesses in neighborhood shopping centers might include 
small grocery stores, drugstores, gas stations, and fast-food restaurants. These 
retailers serve consumers who live less than ten minutes away, usually within a 
two- to three-mile radius of the stores. Because most purchases in the neighborhood 
shopping center are based on convenience or personal contact, these retailers 
generally make only limited efforts to coordinate promotional activities among 
stores in the shopping center.
Community Shopping Centers
A community shopping center includes one or two department stores and some 
specialty stores, along with convenience stores. It attracts consumers from a wider 
geographic area who will drive longer distances to find products and specialty items 
unavailable in neighborhood shopping centers. Community shopping centers, which 
are carefully planned and coordinated, generate traffic with special events such as art 
exhibits, automobile shows, and sidewalk sales. The management of a community 
shopping center maintains a balance of tenants so that the center can offer wide 
product mixes and deep product lines.
Regional Shopping Centers
A regional shopping center usually has large department 
stores, numerous specialty stores, restaurants, movie theaters, 
and sometimes even hotels. It carries most of the merchandise 
offered by a downtown shopping district. Downtown merchants, 
in fact, often have renovated their stores and enlarged their 
parking facilities to meet the competition of successful regional 
shopping centers. Urban expressways and improved public 
transportation also have helped many downtown shopping 
areas remain vigorous.
Regional shopping centers carefully coordinate management 
and marketing activities to reach the 150,000 or more customers 
in their target market. These large centers usually advertise, hold 
special events, and provide transportation to certain groups of 
customers. They also maintain a suitable mix of stores. National 
chain stores can gain leases in regional shopping centers more eas-
ily than small independent stores because they are better able to 
meet the centers’ financial requirements.
The “new” Main Street. Upscale stores and the 
quaint “Main Street”-like atmosphere found in small 
towns a generation ago have made lifestyle shopping 
centers like this one very popular. No longer are 
shoppers trapped indoors when they are at malls.

Physical Distribution 
Physical distribution is all those activities concerned with the efficient movement 
of products from the producer to the ultimate user. Physical distribution therefore is 
the movement of the products themselves—both goods and services—through their 
channels of distribution. It is a combination of several interrelated business functions. 
The most important of these are inventory management, order processing, warehousing, 
materials handling, and transportation.
Not too long ago, each of these functions was considered distinct from all the 
others. In a fairly large firm, one group or department would handle each function. 
Each of these groups would work to minimize its own costs and to maximize its own 
effectiveness, but the result was usually high physical distribution costs. Various studies 
of the problem emphasized both the interrelationships among the physical distribution 
functions and the relationships between physical distribution and other marketing 
functions.
Because of such interrelationships, marketers now view physical distribution as an 
integrated effort that provides important marketing functions: getting the right product 
to the right place at the right time and at minimal overall cost. Figure 14.4 shows the 
proportional costs of each of the major physical distribution functions.
Inventory Management
In Chapter 8 we discussed inventory management from the standpoint of operations. 
We defined inventory management as the process of managing inventories in such 
a  way as to minimize inventory costs, including both holding costs and potential 
stock-out costs. Both the definition and the objective of inventory control apply here 
as well.
Holding costs are the costs of storing products until they are purchased or shipped 
to customers. Stock-out costs are the costs of sales lost when items are not in inven-
tory. Of course, holding costs can be reduced by minimizing inventories, but then 
stock-out costs could be financially threatening to the organization. Stock-out costs 
can be minimized by carrying very large inventories, but then holding costs would be 
enormous.

order processing  activities 
involved in receiving and filling 
customers’ purchase orders
warehousing  the set of activities 
involved in receiving and storing 
goods and preparing them for 
reshipment
Inventory management, therefore, is a sort of balancing act 
between stock-out costs and holding costs. The latter include the 
cost of money invested in inventory, the cost of storage space, 
insurance costs, and inventory taxes. Often, even a relatively small 
reduction in inventory investment can provide a relatively large 
increase in working capital. Sometimes this reduction can best be 
accomplished through a willingness to incur a reasonable level of 
stock-out costs.
Companies frequently rely on technology and software to 
help manage inventory. Efficient inventory management with 
accurate reorder points is crucial for firms that use a just-in-time 
(JIT) approach, in which supplies arrive just as they are needed 
for use in production or for resale. When using JIT, companies 
maintain low inventory levels and purchase products and materi-
als in small quantities whenever they need them. Usually, there 
is no safety stock, and suppliers are expected to provide consis-
tently high-quality products. JIT inventory management requires 
a high level of coordination between producers and suppliers, 
but it eliminates waste and reduces inventory costs significantly. 
This approach has been used successfully by many well-known 
firms, including Chrysler, Harley-Davidson, and Dell Computers, 
to reduce costs and boost customer satisfaction. When a JIT 
approach is used in a supply chain, suppliers often move close to 
their customers.
Order Processing
Order processing consists of activities involved in receiving and filling customers’ 
purchase orders. It may include not only the means by which customers order products 
but also procedures for billing and for granting credit.
Fast, efficient order processing is an important marketing service—one that can 
provide a dramatic competitive edge. The people who purchase goods for intermediar-
ies are especially concerned with their suppliers’ promptness and reliability in order 
processing. To them, promptness and reliability mean minimal inventory costs as well 
as the ability to order goods when they are needed rather than weeks in advance. The 
Internet is providing new opportunities for improving services associated with order 
processing.
Warehousing
Warehousing is the set of activities involved in receiving and storing goods and 
preparing them for reshipment. Goods are stored to create time utility; that is, they 
are held until they are needed for use or sale. Warehousing includes the following 
activities:
●
●Receiving goods—The warehouse accepts delivered goods and assumes responsi-
bility for them.
●
●Identifying goods—Records are made of the quantity of each item received. Items 
may be marked, coded, or tagged for identification.
●
●Sorting goods—Delivered goods may have to be sorted before being stored.
●
●Dispatching goods to storage—Items must be moved to specific storage areas, 
where they can be found later.
●
●Holding goods—The goods are kept in storage under proper protection until 
needed.
●
●Recalling, picking, and assembling goods—Items that are to leave the warehouse 
must be selected from storage and assembled efficiently.
●
●Dispatching shipments—Each shipment is packaged suitably and directed to the 
proper transport vehicle. Shipping and accounting documents are prepared.
Wired warehouses and inventory control. 
Warehouses and inventory management are becoming 
increasingly sophisticated. This handheld inventory 
management device allows employees to get an instant 
overview of every item—and its price—in a warehouse 
at any given time. In some warehouses, electronic 
headsets tell workers exactly where to go to find 
merchandise—much like GPS devices provide people 
with directions.

materials handling  the actual 
physical handling of goods, in 
warehouses as well as during 
transportation
transportation  the shipment of 
products to customers
carrier  a firm that offers 
transportation services
A firm may use its own warehouses or rent space 
in public warehouses. A private warehouse, owned and 
operated by a particular firm, can be designed to serve 
the firm’s specific needs. However, the organization 
must take on the task of financing the facility, deter-
mining the best location for it, and ensuring that it is 
used fully. Generally, only companies that deal in large 
quantities of goods can justify private warehouses. 
Some such companies are United Parcel Service (UPS), 
Walmart, and Sears.
Public warehouses offer their services to all individu-
als and firms. Most are huge one-story structures on the 
outskirts of cities, where rail and truck transportation are 
easily available. They provide storage facilities, areas for 
sorting and assembling shipments, and office and display 
spaces for wholesalers and retailers. Public warehouses also 
will hold—and issue receipts for—goods used as collateral 
for borrowed funds.
Many organizations locate and design their warehouses 
not only to be cost-efficient but also to provide excellent cus-
tomer service.
Materials Handling
Materials handling is the actual physical handling of goods—
in warehouses as well as during transportation. Proper 
materials-handling procedures and techniques can increase 
the usable capacity of a warehouse or that of any means of 
transportation. Proper handling can reduce breakage and 
spoilage as well.
Modern materials handling attempts to reduce the num-
ber of times a product is handled. One method is called unit 
loading. Several smaller cartons, barrels, or boxes are com-
bined into a single standard-size load that can be handled 
efficiently by forklift, conveyer, or truck.
Transportation
As a part of physical distribution, transportation is simply the shipment of products to 
customers. The greater the distance between seller and purchaser, the more important 
is the choice of the means of transportation and the particular carrier. Transportation 
is an essential component of the marketing mix that requires careful planning because 
it can add significant cost. Even in these times of rising fuel costs and concerns over 
greenhouse gas emissions, some companies are finding ways to maintain or cut costs 
through improving transportation networks. Large firms like Nike, Walmart, and IKEA 
have all managed to reduce carbon emissions, cut costs, and improve transportation 
efficiency through better managing their transportation networks. They have cut 
emissions through best practices such as transporting products via ships instead of 
plane or via trains instead of trucks.18
A firm that offers transportation services is called a carrier. A common carrier is a 
transportation firm whose services are available to all shippers. Railroads, airlines, and 
most long-distance trucking firms are common carriers. A contract carrier is available 
for hire by one or several shippers. Contract carriers do not serve the general public. 
Moreover, the number of firms they can handle at any one time is limited by law. A 
private carrier is owned and operated by the shipper.
In addition, a shipper can hire agents called freight forwarders to handle its trans-
portation. Freight forwarders pick up shipments from the shipper, ensure that the 
goods are loaded on selected carriers, and assume responsibility for safe delivery of the

Green Logistics
Mega-retailer Walmart has one of the largest private 
distribution operations in the world, with over 7,000 
tractors and 53,000 trailers rolling around the clock 
and across the country. As part of its green initiative, 
the company’s logistics division has taken a number of 
important steps to make its fleets more efficient and 
environmentally friendly, including testing alternative 
fuels, and using more efficient, aerodynamic trucks along 
with hybrid vehicles. As a result, Walmart has been able to 
avoid 40,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions over 
the past few years—the equivalent of taking 7,600 cars off 
the road! Read more at:

shipments to their destinations. Freight forwarders can often group 
a number of small shipments into one large load (which is carried at 
a lower rate). This, of course, saves money for shippers.
The U.S. Postal Service offers parcel post delivery, which is used 
widely by mail-order houses. The Postal Service provides complete 
geographic coverage at the lowest rates, but it limits the size and 
weight of the shipments it will accept. UPS, a privately owned firm, 
also provides small-parcel services for shippers. Other privately 
owned carriers, such as Federal Express, DHL, and Airborne, offer 
fast—often overnight—parcel delivery both within and outside the 
United States. There are also many local parcel carriers, including 
specialized delivery services for various time-sensitive industries, 
such as publishing.
The six major criteria used for selecting transportation modes 
are compared in Table 14.2. Obviously, the cost of a transporta-
tion mode is important to marketers. At times, marketers choose higher-cost modes 
of transportation because of the benefits they provide. Speed is measured by the total 
time that a carrier possesses the products, including time required for pickup and 
delivery, handling, and movement between point of origin and destination. Usually, 
there is a direct relationship between cost and speed; that is, faster modes of transpor-
tation are more expensive. A transportation mode’s dependability is determined by the 
consistency of service provided by that mode. Load flexibility is the degree to which 
a transportation mode can provide appropriate equipment and conditions for moving 
specific kinds of products and can be adapted for moving other kinds of products. 
For example, certain types of products may need controlled temperatures or humid-
ity levels. Accessibility refers to a transportation mode’s ability to move goods over a 
specific route or network. Frequency refers to how often a marketer can ship products 
by a specific transportation mode. Whereas pipelines provide continuous shipments, 
railroads and waterways follow specific schedules for moving products from one loca-
tion to another. In Table 14.2, each transportation mode is rated on a relative basis for 
these six selection criteria. In addition, Table 14.2 shows a breakdown by use of the 
five different modes of transportation.

products today are being transported in 40- and 
50-foot metal containers like the ones shown on this 
ship. The containers provide flexibility because they 
can be transported by ships, railroads, and trucks. 
Often all three of these transportation modes are used 
to transport a single container.

Part 5   Marketing
Railroads  In terms of total freight carried, railroads are America’s most important 
mode of transportation. They are also the least expensive for many products. Almost 
all railroads are common carriers, although a few coal-mining companies operate their 
own lines.
Many commodities carried by railroads cannot be transported easily by any other 
means. They include a wide range of foodstuffs, raw materials, and manufactured 
goods. Nearly three-quarters of coal in the United States is transported via rail.19 Other 
major commodities carried by railroads include grain, paper and pulp products, liquids 
in tank-car loads, heavy equipment, and lumber.
Trucks  The trucking industry consists of common, contract, and private carriers. It 
has undergone tremendous expansion since the creation of a national highway system 
in the 1920s. Trucks can move goods to suburban and rural areas not served by rail-
roads. They can handle freight quickly and economically, and they carry a wide range 
of shipments. Many shippers favor this mode of transportation because it offers door-
to-door service, less stringent packaging requirements than ships and airplanes, and 
flexible delivery schedules.
Railroad and truck carriers have teamed up to provide a form of transportation 
called piggyback. Truck trailers are carried from city to city on specially equipped rail-
road flatcars. Within each city, the trailers are then pulled in the usual way by truck 
tractors. Some companies offer shipping and consolidation services, which may be a 
good option for smaller companies that do not need to make large shipments because 
it allows them to take advantage of the reduced costs from economies of scale. Such 
shipping companies handle the logistics of transporting products via rail and truck to 
the destination. Piggyback Consolidators is one such carrier. It offers shipping through-
out North America using a low-emissions fuel-efficient fleet, as well as tracking and 
reporting services.20
Airplanes  Air transport is the fastest but most expensive means of transportation. 
All certified airlines are common carriers. Supplemental or charter lines are contract 
carriers.
Because of the high cost, lack of airport facilities in many areas, and reliance on 
weather conditions, airlines carry less than 1 percent of all intercity freight. Only high-
value or perishable items, such as flowers, aircraft parts, and pharmaceuticals or goods 
that are needed immediately, are usually shipped by air.
Waterways  Cargo ships and barges offer the least expensive, but slowest, form of 
transportation. They are used mainly for bulky nonperishable goods such as chemicals, 
grain, motor vehicles, and large equipment. Of course, shipment by water is limited to 
cities located on navigable waterways.
Pipelines  Pipelines are a highly specialized mode of transportation. They are used 
primarily to carry petroleum and natural gas. Plains All American Pipeline, for 
example, is a fast-growing carrier of crude and refined petroleum and liquefied 
petroleum gas. The company handles around 3 million barrels of petroleum prod-
ucts a day through a pipeline system that extends all over the United States and 
Canada.21
Pipelines have become more important as the nation’s need for petroleum products 
has increased. Such products as semiliquid coal and wood chips can also be shipped 
through pipelines continuously, reliably, and with minimal handling.
In the next chapter, we discuss the fourth element of the marketing mix— promotion.

Inside
Business
To keep up with rising demand for Chobani Greek yogurt, 
more than four dozen refrigerated tanker trucks filled with 
milk drive to the company’s production facility in upper 
New York State every day. After the milk is made into yogurt, 
mixed with fruit for flavored varieties, and poured into plas-
tic cups, convoys of refrigerated trucks take the yogurt to 
Chobani’s coast-to-coast network of retailer partners. In 
all, Chobani produces 2 million cases of Greek yogurt every 
week and remains the brand to beat in its category.
When Chobani introduced Champions, its Greek yogurt 
for children, the product line gained wide distribution in a 
short time, thanks to strong retail connections. Now the 
company is testing international distribution, partnering 
with Loblaw’s in Canada and Woolworths in Australia. 
Watch for retail tests in other markets and new flavors for 
adults and children as Chobani continues its expansion.
Questions
1.	 When Chobani decided to pursue distribution in big 
retail chains, what level of market coverage was it 
aiming for? Why was this appropriate?
2.	 When planning physical distribution activities for a 
perishable food product like Chobani yogurt, what 
elements do marketers have to pay particular atten-
tion to—and why?

Identify the various channels of distribution that 
are used for consumer and industrial products.
A marketing channel is a sequence of marketing organizations 
that directs a product from producer to ultimate user. The 
marketing channel for a particular product is concerned 
with the transfer of ownership of that product. Merchant 
middlemen (merchants) actually take title to products, 
whereas functional middlemen simply aid in the transfer of 
title.
The channels used for consumer products include the 
direct channel from producer to consumer; the channel from 
producer to retailer to consumer; the channel from producer 
to wholesaler to retailer to consumer; and the channel from 
producer to agent to wholesaler to retailer to consumer. There 
are two major channels of industrial products: (1) producer 
to user and (2) producer to agent middleman to user.
Explain the concept of market coverage.
Channels and intermediaries are chosen to implement a given 
level of market coverage. Intensive distribution is the use 
of all available outlets for a product, providing the widest 
market coverage. Selective distribution uses only a portion 
of the available outlets in an area. Exclusive distribution uses 
only a single retail outlet for a product in a large geographic 
area.
Understand how supply-chain management 
facilitates partnering among channel members.
Supply-chain management is a long-term partnership 
among channel members working together to create a 
distribution system that reduces inefficiencies, costs, and 
redundancies while creating a competitive advantage and 
satisfying customers. Cooperation is required among all 
channel members, including manufacturing, research, sales, 
advertising, and shipping. When all channel partners work 
together, delivery, scheduling, packaging, and other customer 
requirements are better met. Technology, such as bar coding 
and electronic data exchange (EDI), makes supply-chain 
management easier to implement.
Describe what a vertical marketing system is and 
identify the types of vertical marketing systems.
A VMS is a centrally managed system. It results when two or 
more channel members from different levels combine under 
one management. Administered, contractual, and corporate 
systems represent the three major types of VMSs.
Discuss the need for wholesalers and describe 
the services they provide to retailers and 
manufacturers.
Wholesalers are intermediaries that purchase from producers 
or other intermediaries and sell to industrial users, retailers, 
or other wholesalers. Wholesalers perform many functions in 
a distribution channel. If they are eliminated, other channel 
members—such as the producer or retailers—must perform 
these functions. Wholesalers provide retailers with help in 
promoting products, collecting information, and financing. They

provide manufacturers with sales help, reduce their inventory 
costs, furnish market information, and extend credit to retailers.
Identify and describe the major types of 
wholesalers.
Merchant wholesalers buy and then sell products. Commission 
merchants and brokers are essentially agents and do not take 
title to the goods they distribute. Sales branches and offices 
are owned by the manufacturers they represent and resemble 
merchant wholesalers and agents, respectively.
Distinguish among the major types of retailers.
Retailers are intermediaries that buy from producers or 
wholesalers and sell to consumers. In-store retailers include 
department stores, discount stores, catalog and warehouse 
showrooms, convenience stores, supermarkets, superstores, 
warehouse clubs, traditional specialty stores, off-price 
retailers, and category killers. Nonstore retailers do not 
sell in conventional store facilities. Instead, they use direct 
selling, direct marketing, and automatic vending. Types of

There are three major types of shopping centers: 
neighborhood, community, and regional. A center fits one of 
these categories based on its mix of stores and the size of the 
geographic area it serves.
Explain the five most important physical 
distribution activities.
Physical distribution consists of activities designed to move 
products from producers to ultimate users. Its five major 
functions are inventory management, order processing, 
warehousing, materials handling, and transportation. These 
interrelated functions are integrated into the marketing 
effort.

Discussion Questions
Taza Chocolate, a small Massachusetts-based manufacturer of 
stone-ground organic chocolate made in the classic Mexican 
tradition, sells most of its products to retailers, wholesalers, and 
distributors throughout the United States. Individual custom-
ers around the world can also buy Taza chocolate bars, bak-
ing squares, chocolate-covered nuts, and other specialty items 
directly from Taza at the company’s Web site, and if they live in 
Somerville (Massachusetts), they might even find a Taza employee 
riding a “chococycle,” selling products and distributing samples 
at an upscale food truck festival or open market on a weekend.
With a staff of about 20 people, Taza sources all its ingredients 
directly from certified organic growers with whom the company 
cultivates a personal relationship. “Because our process here at the 
factory is so minimal,” says the company’s director of sales, “it’s 
really important that we get a very high-quality ingredient. . . . The 
cocoa beans are the most important. . . . When we source those, 
we pay a premium above even fair-trade prices. We call it direct 
trade. To make sure that we’re getting the absolute cream of the 
crop, we have a direct face-to-face human relationship between 
us and the actual farmer that’s producing those beans.”
The company believes that dealing directly with its suppli-
ers is the best business model for Taza as a small firm, not only 
because it allows the company to meet its social responsibility 
goals, but also because it ensures quality, which commands a 
premium price. “We’re a premium brand,” says the director of 
sales, “and because of the way we do what we do, we have to 
charge more than [the cost of] your average chocolate bar. . . 
. There’s ­usually a 40 to 50 percent markup between wholesale 
sales and the price . . . on the retail store shelf. So, say we sell a 
chocolate bar for $4.50 . . . then the wholesale price is going to 
be somewhere around $2.70 for that unit. . . . The distributor 
price [is] even lower, maybe around $2.” Distributors buy in the 
largest quantities, which for Taza means a pallet load as opposed 
to a case that a wholesaler would buy. “But wholesale will always 
be our bread and butter, where we really move the volume and we 
have good margins. . . . It’s been challenging for us to work with 
distributors. They’re always squeezing you on price, or trying to 
give you charge backs, or run promotions or do sales . . . whereas 
the average wholesale customer is, in our industry at least, . . . 
much more used to accepting what we give them in terms of pro-
motions or pricing.”
Taza does almost no advertising, relying instead on Facebook, 
Twitter, a company blog, e-mail, and events that create buzz like 
chocolate salons, food shows, in-store tastings, and especially 
frequent sampling in upscale and organic food stores in big met-
ropolitan areas. The company tries to cultivate the same sort of 
personal relationships with members of its distribution channel 
as it does with its cocoa farmers. “When we send a shipment of 
chocolate,” says the sales director, “sometimes we’ll put in a little 
extra for the people who work there. That always helps because 
you’re building that kind of human relationship.”
A privately owned firm, Taza has just begun shipping its 
chocolate products internationally to Canada and a handful of 
European companies. Its marketing channel definitely plays a role

Part 5   Marketing
in delivering products that are fresh. Shipping perishable products 
to customers in the summer, for instance, can be a problem. But 
“having a distributor . . . that has a couple of thousand dollars of 
inventory in their refrigerated warehouse all the time changes that 
equation. It means the store can just order from that distribu-
tor, pay about the same price that they would pay if they ordered 
directly from us, [and] get the product probably the next day, 
with much lower shipping cost.”22
Questions
1.	 Which distribution channels does Taza use?
2.	 In what ways does Taza benefit from selling directly to con-
sumers? What are the potential problems that Taza may expe-
rience by selling directly to consumers?
3.	 If Taza wanted to grow its sales by broadening physical dis-
tribution of its products, do you think it should work more 
closely with its wholesalers or with its distributors? Why?
When Michael Dell started his Texas-based computer business in 
1984, he chose a distribution strategy that was radically different 
from that of other computer marketers. Instead of selling through 
wholesalers and retailers, the company dealt directly with custom-
ers. This kept costs low and allowed Dell to cater to customers’ 
needs by building each computer to order. Using a direct channel 
also minimized inventory costs and reduced the risk that parts 
and products would become obsolete even before customers 
placed their orders, a constant concern in high-tech industries.
By 1997, Dell’s Web site alone was responsible for $1 million 
a day in sales. Relying on the strength of its online sales, cata-
logs, and phone orders, Dell expanded beyond the United States 
and added new products for four target markets: consumers, 
large corporations, small businesses, and government agencies. 
Meanwhile, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, and other competitors were 
reaching out to many of the same segments with a combination of 
direct and indirect channels. Apple Stores, for example, proved to 
be major customer magnets and gave a significant boost to sales 
of Macintosh computers and other Apple electronics. Hewlett-
Packard forged strong ties with value-added resellers (VARs), inter-
mediaries that assemble systems of computers, servers, and other 
products customized to meet the special needs of business buyers.
Although Dell tested retail distribution on a number of occa-
sions, it never let the experiments go on for too long. In the 
1990s, it tried selling PCs through a few big U.S. retail chains, but 
soon discontinued the arrangement because the profit margins 
weren’t as healthy as in the direct channel. Later, it opened a 
series of branded retail kiosks in major U.S. markets to display its 
products and answer customers’ questions. Unlike stores, how-
ever, the kiosks didn’t actually sell anything: Customers could only 
place orders for future delivery. Dell ultimately closed the kiosks 
down.
By 2007, with competitors coming on strong, Dell was ready 
to rethink its worldwide channel strategy. As convenient as online 
shopping was for many U.S. computer buyers, it was much less 
popular in many other countries. To gain market share domesti-
cally and internationally, Dell would have to follow consumers 
into stores, malls, and downtown shopping districts. The com-
pany began selling a few models through Walmart’s U.S. stores, 
Carphone Warehouse’s U.K. stores, Bic Camera’s Japanese stores, 
and Gome’s Chinese stores. In addition, it opened Dell stores in 
Moscow, Budapest, and other world capitals.
By 2010, sales through retailers had gained enough momen-
tum that Dell sought out other retail deals. In another chan-
nel change, it began selling through VAR partners that serve 
small- and medium-sized businesses and lined up wholesalers to 
distribute its products in Europe, Latin America, and elsewhere. 
When Dell introduced a new line of smartphones, it needed a 
new channel arrangement to reach buyers. Therefore, it arranged 
for mobile phone carriers such as AT&T to sell the new models to 
their customers.
As successful as Dell has been in revamping its indirect chan-
nels, selling directly to customers remains a top priority. Dell invites 
orders around the clock through Web pages tailored to the needs 
of each target market. It also maintains an online outlet store to 
sell discontinued and refurbished products. It mails millions of cat-
alogs and direct-mail pieces every year. And its sales force calls on 
government officials and big businesses that buy in volume. Dell’s 
Web site notes, with pride, that the ten largest U.S. corporations 
and five largest U.S. commercial banks “run on Dell.”
Moreover, the company is a pioneer in stimulating exchanges 
with customers through social media. Dell has 139,000 fans on 
Facebook, for example, and regularly posts offers that drive cus-
tomers to its various Web sites. It’s become a pioneer in selling 
directly to customers via the microblog site Twitter. In less than 
three years, it generated $6.5 million in revenue from sales trans-
actions that originated on Twitter. That may be a tiny sliver of 
Dell’s $53 billion in annual revenue, but it demonstrates the com-
pany’s flexibility in adapting to shifts in customer behavior and 
environmental forces, such as technological advances.
With market share and profit-margin challenges still facing the 
company, and global demand just picking up steam after a long, 
difficult recession, watch for Dell to make more channel adjust-
ments in the coming years.23
Questions for Discussion
1.	 Is Dell using intensive, selective, or exclusive distribution for its 
market coverage? Why is this appropriate for Dell’s products 
and target markets?
2.	 What are the major advantages and disadvantages of Dell’s 
use of multiple marketing channels instead of using just the 
direct marketing channel?
3.	 In what ways did Dell’s physical distribution practices change 
as it changed to using multiple marketing channels?

Chapter 14   Wholesaling, Retailing, and Physical Distribution	
421
1 	SOCIAL MEDIA EXERCISE
Wholesaling, retailing and physical distribution
Gamification is a new trend in social media that essentially uses the 
ideas and theories behind gaming (rewards, competition, levels and 
so forth) to engage people online. Fantasy Shopper is a good exam-
ple of combining the retail experience (in this case fashion retail-
ing) with online games. For example, a luxury handbag by Stella 
McCartney worth $960 is the prize in a online game to design the 
best virtual outfit using real items on sale in Matches, a real store. 
The players of the game choose the winner. Players visit a city (say 
London, with others to follow) and compete to find bargains and 
assemble the best outfits using virtual money to spend on goods 
actually sold in stores. The choices are then published in Facebook 
newsfeeds and others can vote on these looks. In addition to win-
ning real prizes, players are also rewarded virtually with badges and 
vouchers to use in real stores. This game is popular with women 
20–25 and retailers are excited because it helps them to promote 
their products and provides instant feedback about what is likely to 
sell. The real value to retailers is the amount of data generated and 
passed along by these “social shopping” firms based on the players’ 
behavior. Visit Fantasy Shopper (www.fantasyshopper.com) and 
take a look about the games available.24
1.	 For what types of retailers are these games most likely to be 
effective?
2.	 While the game mentioned above is aimed at women 20–25, 
what other age and gender segments would be most likely to 
participate in online games? 
2 	JOURNALING FOR SUCCESS
Discovery statement: In this chapter, you learned that retailers 
are marketing intermediaries and part of the distribution channel.
Assignment
1.	 Thinking about brick-and-mortar retail stores, in which store 
have you had your most enjoyable shopping experience? 
Describe this retail store.
2.	 Discuss this shopping experience and why it was such a great 
shopping experience.
3.	 At what brick-and-mortar store did you have your worst expe-
rience? Describe this store.
4.	 Discuss this worst shopping experience and be sure to men-
tion the reasons why this shopping experience was the worst 
one for you.
3 	DEVELOPING CRITICAL-THINKING SKILLS
According to the wheel of retailing hypothesis, retail businesses 
begin as low-margin, low-priced, low-status operations. As they 
successfully challenge established retailers for market share, they 
upgrade their facilities and offer more services. This raises their 
costs and forces them to increase their prices so that eventually 
they become like the conventional retailers they replaced. As they 
move up from the low end of the wheel, new firms with lower 
costs and prices move in to take their place. For example, Kmart 
started as a low-priced operation that competed with depart-
ment stores. Over time, it upgraded its facilities and products; 
big Kmart stores now offer such exclusive merchandise as Martha 
Stewart’s bed-and-bath collection, full-service pharmacies, café 
areas, and “pantry” areas stocked with frequently bought grocery 
items, including milk, eggs, and bread. In consequence, Kmart has 
become a higher-cost, higher-priced operation and, as such, is vul-
nerable to lower-priced firms entering at the low end of the wheel.
Assignment
1.	 Investigate the operations of a local retailer.
2.	 Explain how this retailer is evolving on the wheel of retailing.
3.	 Prepare a report on your findings.
4 	BUILDING TEAM SKILLS
Surveys are a commonly used tool in marketing research. The 
information they provide can reduce business risk and facilitate 
decision making. Retail outlets often survey their customers’ wants 
and needs by distributing comment cards or questionnaires.
The following customer survey is an example of a survey that a 
local photography shop might distribute to its customers.
Assignment
1.	 Working in teams of three to five, choose a local retailer.
2.	 Classify the retailer according to the major types of retailers.
3.	 Design a survey to help the retailer to improve customer 
service. (You may find it beneficial to work with the retailer 
and actually administer the survey to the retailer’s customers. 
Prepare a report of the survey results for the retailer.)
4.	 Present your findings to the class.
5 	RESEARCHING DIFFERENT CAREERS
When you are looking for a job, the people closest to you can be 
extremely helpful. Family members and friends may be able to answer 
your questions directly or put you in touch with someone else who 
can. This type of “networking” can lead to an “informational inter-
view,” in which you can meet with someone who will answer your 
questions about a career or a company and who can also provide 
inside information on related fields and other helpful hints.
Assignment
1.	 Choose a retailer or wholesaler and a position within the 
company that interests you.
2.	 Call the company and ask to speak to the person in that partic-
ular position. Explain that you are a college student interested 
in the position, and ask to set up an “informational interview.”
3.	 Prepare a list of questions to ask in the interview. The ques-
tions should focus on:
	
a.  The type of training recommended for the position
	
b.  How the person entered the position and advanced in it
	
c.  What he or she likes and dislikes about the work
	
d.  Present your findings to the class.

By Incorporating Hot Guys and Humor, Old Spice Heats Up on Profits
How can a 1940s brand attract 21st-century audiences? That was the challenge facing 
Procter & Gamble’s marketers when they thought about spicing up the marketing commu-
nications of Old Spice, its brand of men’s fragrance, body wash, and deodorant products. 
After decades of popularity, Old Spice was being eclipsed by Unilever’s Axe and other new 
brands with edgier images and flashier advertising. To revitalize Old Spice, P&G teamed up 
with the ad agency Wieden+Kennedy to launch the multimedia “Old Spice Guy” campaign, 
aiming to renew interest in the brand, build buzz, and boost sales.
The initial campaign featured former NFL football player Isaiah Mustafa in a series of 
humorous commercials, online videos, and print ads. Wearing only a towel, as if he had just 
stepped out of the shower, the muscular Mustafa greeted his audience—“Hello ladies”—
and said he was “the man your man could smell like” if they bought Old Spice. This cam-
paign grabbed immediate attention, and Old Spice Guy videos on YouTube quickly drew 
millions of views. The follow-up was a series of brief online videos featuring Mustafa mak-
ing clever remarks on camera to influential celebrities and answering questions directed 
to him on Twitter. The Old Spice Man appeared in so many ads in such a short time that 
the campaign received widespread publicity for its innovative timing and creative content, 
adding to the momentum and increasing brand awareness.
A few months later, the agency introduced a new campaign pitting Mustafa against 
model-turned–romance novelist Fabio in a tongue-in-cheek battle for the title of Old Spice 
Guy. Through ads, online videos, and social media comments, the two traded wry com-
ments and invited the public to vote for their favorite. In the end, Mustafa won—and so did 
the brand. The new spice put Old Spice into the spotlight and gave it a bit of attitude to 
stand out from competing brands. Best of all, “Old Spice leaped into first place in market 
share and is still growing,” says the head of Procter & Gamble’s North America division. 
“We ran out of product and could not keep up with sales.”1 
M
arketers employ multiple promotional methods to create very favorable 
company and product images in the minds of customers. Skillful use of pro-
motion is of great benefit to many brands like Old Spice.
Promotion is communication about an organization and its products that is 
intended to inform, persuade, or remind target-market members. The promotion with 
which we are most familiar—advertising—is intended to inform, persuade, or remind 
us to buy particular products. But there is more to promotion than advertising, and it is 
used for other purposes as well. Charities use promotion to inform us of their need for 
donations, to persuade us to give, and to remind us to do so in case we have forgotten. 
Even the Internal Revenue Service uses promotion (in the form of publicity) to remind 
us of its April 15 deadline for filing tax returns.
A promotion mix (sometimes called a marketing–communications mix) is the par-
ticular combination of promotional methods a firm uses to reach a target market. The 
makeup of a mix depends on many factors, including the firm’s promotional resources 
and objectives, the nature of the target market, the product characteristics, and the 
feasibility of various promotional methods.
In this chapter, we introduce four promotional methods and describe how they are 
used in an organization’s marketing plans. First, we examine the role of advertising in 
the promotion mix. We discuss different types of advertising, the process of developing 
an advertising campaign, and social and legal concerns in advertising.

Guy commercials and videos

Next, we consider several categories of personal selling, noting the importance of 
effective sales management. We also look at sales promotion—why firms use it and 
which sales promotion techniques are most effective. Then we explain how public rela-
tions can be used to promote an organization and its products. Also, we illustrate how 
these four promotional methods are combined in an effective promotion mix. Finally, 
we discuss the criticisms of promotion.
What Is Integrated Marketing 
Communications?
Integrated marketing communications is the coordination of promotion efforts to 
ensure their maximal informational and persuasive impact on customers. A major goal 
of integrated marketing communications is to send a consistent message to customers. 
This approach fosters not only long-term customer relationships but also the efficient 
use of promotional resources.
The concept of integrated marketing communications has been increasingly 
accepted for several reasons. Mass-media advertising, a very popular promotional 
method in the past, is used less today because of its high costs and unpredictable 
audience sizes. Marketers now can take advantage of more precisely targeted pro-
motional tools, such as cable TV, direct mail, DVDs, the Internet, special-interest 
magazines, and podcasts. Database marketing is also allowing marketers to be 
more precise in targeting individual customers. Mass media advertising used to be 
much more popular than it is today. It is still widely used, but as only one tool in 
an expanding toolkit of marketing communication options. Marketers today have 
access to a wide variety of advertising and promotional options. Marketers can now 
use a mix of high-tech options, such as cable and satellite television, emails, online 
social media, and podcasts. Thanks to online digital media, marketers today can 
more precisely identify their target audience with affordable advertising campaigns 
that directly address their customers’ needs and wants. Until recently, specialists 
handled different aspects of marketing communication campaigns. Advertising agen-
cies created advertising campaigns, sales promotion companies handled sales pro-
motion activities, and public relations firms handled public relations issues. Today, 
firms can rely on organizations that provide one-stop shopping for all marketing and 
promotion-related activities. Such firms help to reduce coordination problems and 
improve integration between different functions. This is beneficial because marketing 
communications can be very expensive and it is important for firms to ensure that 
promotional resources are used as efficiently as possible. To appeal to consumers 
while saving money on their advertising budgets, firms are even relying on custom-
ers to help develop effective advertisements and to design promotional activities. 
Companies like Doritos and Pepsi have utilized consumer advertising and promotion 
ideas with great success. These campaigns generate a lot of buzz and can be produced 
much more cheaply than a professional campaign. Viral marketing is another way to 
achieve broad advertising reach via digital channels for minimal cost. Most market-
ers now acknowledge the importance and power of utilizing viral marketing.2
The Role of Promotion
Promotion is commonly the object of two misconceptions. Often, people take note 
of highly visible promotional activities, such as advertising and personal selling, and 
conclude that these make up the entire field of marketing. People also sometimes 
consider promotional activities to be unnecessary, expensive, and the cause of higher 
prices. Neither view is accurate.
The role of promotion is to facilitate exchanges directly or indirectly by informing 
individuals, groups, or organizations and influencing them to accept a firm’s products

Part 5   Marketing
advertising  a paid nonpersonal 
message communicated to a select 
audience through a mass medium
personal selling  personal 
communication aimed at 
informing customers and 
persuading them to buy a firm’s 
products
sales promotion  the use of 
activities or materials as direct 
inducements to customers or 
salespersons
public relations  communication 
activities used to create and 
maintain favorable relations 
between an organization and 
various public groups, both 
internal and external
or to have more positive feelings about the firm. To expedite exchanges directly, mar-
keters convey information about a firm’s goods, services, and ideas to particular mar-
ket segments. To bring about exchanges indirectly, marketers address interest groups 
(such as environmental and consumer groups), regulatory agencies, investors, and the 
general public concerning a company and its products. The broader role of promotion, 
therefore, is to maintain positive relationships between a company and various groups 
in the marketing environment.
Marketers frequently design promotional communications, such as advertisements, 
for specific groups, although some may be directed at wider audiences. Several differ-
ent messages may be communicated simultaneously to different market segments. For 
example, BP must address stakeholders concerned about the aftereffects of the 2010 
Deepwater Horizon oil leak and subsequent cleanup efforts; inform customers about 
its products and services; and update investors about financial performance.
Marketers must plan, implement, and coordinate promotional communications 
carefully to make the best use of them. The effectiveness of promotional activities 
depends greatly on the quality and quantity of information available to marketers about 
the organization’s marketing environment (see Figure 15.1). If a marketer wants to 
influence customers to buy a certain product, for example, the firm must know who 
these customers are and how they make purchase decisions for that type of product. 
Marketers must gather and use information about particular audiences to communicate 
successfully with them. At times, two or more firms partner in joint promotional efforts.
The Promotion Mix: An Overview
Marketers can use several promotional methods to communicate with individuals, 
groups, and organizations. The methods that are combined to promote a particular 
product make up the promotion mix for that item.
Advertising, personal selling, sales promotion, and public relations are the four 
major elements in an organization’s promotion mix (see Figure 15.2) While it is pos-
sible that only one ingredient may be used, it is likely that two, three, or four of these 
ingredients will be used together in a promotion mix, depending on the type of product 
and target market involved.
Advertising is a paid nonpersonal message communicated to a select audience 
through a mass medium. Advertising is flexible enough that it can reach a very large 
target group or a small, carefully chosen one. Personal selling is personal communica-
tion aimed at informing customers and persuading them to buy a firm’s products. It is 
more expensive to reach a consumer through personal selling than through advertis-
ing, but this method provides immediate feedback and often is more persuasive than 
advertising. Sales promotion is the use of activities or materials as direct inducements 
to customers or salespersons. It adds extra value to the product or increases the cus-
tomer’s incentive to buy the product. Public relations is a broad set of communication 
activities used to create and maintain favorable relationships between an organization 
and various public groups, both internal and external.
A promotional activity’s effectiveness depends on the information available to 
marketers.

Advertising
Last year, organizations spent over $144 billion on measured media advertising in the 
United States.3 We will discuss how this money is spent by first looking at the type of 
advertising. Then, we focus on advertising media and the steps involved in developing 
an advertising campaign.
Types of Advertising by Purpose
Depending on its purpose and message, advertising may be classified into one of three 
groups: primary demand, selective demand, or institutional.
Primary-Demand Advertising  Primary-demand advertising is advertising 
aimed at increasing the demand for all brands of a product within a specific indus-
try The Corn Refiners Association, for example, launched a multimedia campaign 
designed to educate consumers about high fructose corn syrup in an effort to downplay 
negative publicity surrounding the refined corn ingredient.4 
Selective-Demand Advertising  Selective-demand (or brand) advertising is 
advertising that is used to sell a particular brand of product. It is by far the most com-
mon type of advertising, and it accounts for the lion’s share of advertising expenditures.
Selective advertising that aims at persuading consumers to make purchases within a 
short time is called immediate-response advertising. Most local advertising is of this type. 
Often local advertisers promote products with immediate appeal. Selective advertising 
aimed at keeping a firm’s name or product before the public is called reminder advertising.
Comparative advertising, which has become more popular over the last three 
decades, compares specific characteristics of two or more identified brands. Of course, 
the comparison shows the advertiser’s brand to be as good as or better than the other 
identified competing brands. Consumers sometimes become rather guarded concerning 
claims based on “scientific studies” and various statistical manipulations. Comparative 
advertising is unacceptable or illegal in a number of countries.
Institutional Advertising  Institutional advertising is advertising designed to 
enhance a firm’s image or reputation. A positive public image helps an organization to 
attract not only customers but also employees and investors. BP’s “Still Working, Still

three types of advertising.

Committed” campaign addresses the company’s efforts to clean up and maintain the 
environment in the Gulf of Mexico after the massive Deepwater Horizon oil leak. This 
ongoing ad campaign seeks to repair BP’s damaged image by demonstrating a commit-
ment to cleaning up pollution in the Gulf, showing a commitment to environmental-
ism, and restoring consumer faith in the company.5
Advertising Media
The advertising media are the various forms of communication through which 
advertising reaches its audience. The major media are newspapers, magazines, direct 
mail, Yellow Pages, out-of-home displays, television, radio, the Internet, and social 
media. Figure 15.3 shows the proportion of ad dollars spent on selected media.
Newspapers  A very large proportion of newspaper advertising is purchased by local 
retailers. Retailers use newspaper advertising extensively because it is relatively inexpen-
sive compared with other media. Moreover, since most newspapers provide local coverage, 
advertising dollars are not wasted in reaching people outside the organization’s market 
area. It is also timely. Ads usually can be placed just a few days before they are to appear.
There are some drawbacks, however, to newspaper advertising. It has a short life 
span; newspapers generally are read through once and then discarded. Newspaper 
readership is declining. Color reproduction in newspapers is usually not high quality; 
thus, most ads are run in black and white. Finally, marketers cannot target specific 
demographic groups through newspaper ads because newspapers are read by such a 
broad spectrum of people.

Primary-demand advertising versus selective-demand advertising. The "got milk?" ad is designed to stimulate 
the demand for all milk brands. It is an example of primary-demand advertising. In contrast, the Prius ad is designed to 
stimulate a single car brand. It is an example of selective-demand advertising.

direct-mail advertising  promotional 
material mailed directly to 
individuals
Yellow Pages advertising  simple 
listings or display advertisements 
presented under specific product 
categories appearing in print and 
online telephone directories
Magazines  The amount of money companies spend on magazine advertising has 
been flat over the last few years. However, advertisers can reach very specific market 
segments through ads in special-interest magazines. A boat manufacturer has a ready-
made consumer audience in subscribers to Yachting or Sail. A number of magazines 
such as Time and Cosmopolitan publish regional editions, which provide advertisers 
with geographic flexibility as well.
Magazine advertising is more prestigious than newspaper advertising, and it 
allows for high-quality color reproduction. In addition, magazine advertisements 
have a longer life span than those in other media and the ads they contain may be 
viewed repeatedly.
The major disadvantages of magazine advertising are high cost and lack of timeli-
ness. Because magazine ads normally must be prepared two to three months in advance, 
they cannot be adjusted to reflect the latest market conditions. Magazine ads—especially 
full-color ads—are also expensive. Although the cost of reaching 18 million people may 
compare favorably with that of other media, the cost of a full-page four-color ad can 
be very high—$320,000 in Time.6
Direct Mail  Direct-mail advertising is promotional material mailed directly to indi-
viduals. Direct mail is the most selective medium; mailing lists are available (or can be 
compiled) to reach almost any target audience, from airplane enthusiasts to zoologists. 
The effectiveness of direct-mail advertising can be measured because the advertiser has a 
record of who received the advertisements and can track who responds to the ads.
Some organizations are using direct e-mail. To avoid customers receiving unwanted 
e-mail, a firm should ask customers to complete a request form in order to receive pro-
motional e-mail from the company.
The success of direct-mail advertising depends to some extent on maintaining 
appropriate and current mailing lists. A direct-mail campaign may fail if the mailing list 
is outdated and the mailing does not reach the right people. In addition, this medium 
is relatively costly.
Yellow Pages Advertising  Yellow Pages advertising appears in telephone direc-
tories that are distributed to millions of customers around the United States, as well as 
online at http://yellowpages.com. Customers use Yellow Pages advertising to save time 
finding products, to find information quickly, and to learn about products and market-
ers. Unlike other types of advertising media, Yellow Pages advertisements are purchased 
for one year and cannot be changed.

Part 5   Marketing
out-of-home advertising  short 
promotional messages on 
billboards, posters, signs, and 
transportation vehicles
infomercial  a program-length 
televised commercial message 
resembling an entertainment or 
consumer affairs program
Out-of-Home Advertising  Out-of-home advertising consists of 
short promotional messages on billboards, posters, signs, and transpor-
tation vehicles.
Sign and billboard advertising allows the marketer to focus on a par-
ticular geographic area; it is also fairly inexpensive. However, because most 
outdoor promotion is directed toward a mobile audience, the message must 
be limited to a few words. The medium is especially suitable for products 
that lend themselves to pictorial display.
Television  Television ranks number one in total advertising expendi-
tures. Approximately 97 percent of American homes have at least one 
television set and the average American watches 5 hours and 30 minutes 
of television a day.
Television advertising is the primary medium for larger firms whose 
objective is to reach national or regional markets. A national advertiser 
may buy network time, which means that its message usually will be 
broadcast by hundreds of local stations affiliated with the network. 
However, the opportunity to reach extremely large television audiences 
has been reduced by the increased availability and popularity of cable 
channels and home videos. Both national and local firms may buy local 
time on a single station that covers a particular geographic area.
Advertisers may sponsor an entire show, participate with other sponsors of a show, 
or buy spot time for a single 10-, 20-, 30-, or 60-second commercial during or between 
programs. To an extent, they may select their audience by choosing the day of the week 
and the approximate time of day their ads will be shown. Anheuser-Busch advertises 
Budweiser beer during televised football games because the majority of viewers are 
men, who are likely to buy beer.
Marketers also can employ product placement, which is paying a fee to have a prod-
uct appear in a television program, movie, or music video. The product might appear on a 
table or counter, or one or more of the actors might be using it. Through channel switching 
and personal digital video recorders (DVRs), television viewers can avoid watching regu-
lar television commercials. By placing the product directly into the program, viewers are 
likely to be exposed to the product. Product placement continues to be a stable advertising 
method for many marketers. Music videos are increasingly a venue for product placement, 
particularly if an artist is a representative for a product. Artists like Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, 
and Rihanna frequently showcase prominently-displayed products and brand names in 
their music videos. To facilitate the product placement process in music videos, My Product 
Placement is a new platform that aims to match musical artists and products.7 Recently 
researchers reported that 90 percent of all television viewing remains live because more 
than half of all TV households still do not have access to time-shifting devices (DVRs). Even 
in households that do have DVRs, only about 20 percent of the viewing time is shifted.
Another option available to television advertisers is the infomercial. An infomer-
cial is a program-length televised commercial message resembling an entertainment 
or consumer affairs program. Infomercials for products such as exercise equipment 
tell customers why they need the product, what benefits it provides, in what ways 
it outperforms its competitors, and how much it costs. Although initially aired 
primarily over cable television, today infomercials are becoming more common on 
network and local TV as well. Currently, infomercials are responsible for market-
ing over $1 billion worth of products annually. Even some Fortune 500 companies 
are using them.
Television advertising rates are based on the number of people expected to be 
watching when the commercial is aired. In 2012, the cost of a 30-second Super Bowl 
commercial was $3.5 million. Advertisers typically spend over $500,000 for a 30-sec-
ond television commercial during a top-rated prime-time program.8
Radio  Like magazine advertising, radio advertising offers selectivity. Radio stations 
develop programming for—and are tuned in by—specific groups of listeners. There are 
©Sherab/Alamy
Taking advertising to the streets—and 
other places. Out-of-home advertisements are 
designed to reach consumers while they are out 
of their homes. Promotional messages on buses, 
the backs of street benches, in stadiums, and 
on backs of the doors of restroom stalls are all 
examples of out-of-home advertising.

IKEA Remodels Perceptions with Fix This Kitchen
could have fun with a virtual renovation and express their 
personal style through IKEA’s products.
As Fix This Kitchen began to air, IKEA also launched a full 
campaign of advertising, public relations, and special events. 
When its agencies evaluated the results, they found a 60 
percent increase in the number of people who agreed that 
IKEA offers high-quality materials, plus a 33 percent increase 
in the number of people using IKEA’s kitchen-design tools. 
Most important, store traffic and sales were on the rise, along 
with the size of the average sale.

SUCCESS

When viewers watch the reality show 
Fix This Kitchen on the A&E channel, they 
see renovations starring kitchen cabinets, 
counters, and cookware from IKEA. The 
retailer’s ad agencies came up with the idea for the 
series after discovering, through research, that customers 
viewed IKEA as a store for low-priced accessories, not as a 
place to design and furnish their dream kitchen. With this 
in mind, the agencies cooked up Fix This Kitchen to achieve 
two main objectives. The first was to change customers’ 
perceptions of the stores’ merchandise by showing a wide 
range of kitchen makeovers. The second was to draw 
customers to IKEA’s kitchen-design Web site, where they 
almost half a billion radios in the United States (about six per household), which makes 
radio the most accessible medium.
Radio advertising can be less expensive than in other media. Actual rates depend 
on geographic coverage, the number of commercials contracted for, the time period 
specified, and whether the station broadcasts on AM, FM, or both. Even small retailers 
are able to afford radio advertising, and a radio advertiser can schedule and change ads 
on short notice. The disadvantages of using radio are the absence of visual images and 
(because there are so many stations) the small audience size.
Internet  Spending on Internet advertising has increased significantly. 
Internet advertising can take a variety of forms. The banner ad is a rect-
angular graphic that appears at the top of a Web site. Many Web sites 
are able to offer free services because they are supported by banner 
advertisements. Advertisers can use animation and interactive capabili-
ties to draw more attention to their ads. Another type of advertising 
is sponsorship (or cobranded ads). These ads integrate a company’s 
brand with editorial content. The goal of this type of ad is to get users 
to strongly identify the advertiser with the site’s mission. For example, 
a running shoe advertiser such as Nike may choose to place advertise-
ments on a popular lifestyle blog related to running because the site is 
affiliated with the mission and activities of the firm. The Web site for a 
cable home-repair network, http://DIYNetwork.com, displays clickable 
advertisements related to featured articles. Someone browsing articles 
on windows would find advertisements for different windows on the 
site. Such online ads also make it easy for consumers to click over to 
the company’s site to make purchases or browse products.9
Many Internet advertisers choose to purchase keywords on pop-
ular search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo!, and MSN. For 
example, Kellogg’s purchased the word cereal on Google so that every 
time someone conducts a search using that word, a link to Kellogg’s 
Web site appears. Interstitial ads pop up to display a product. For 
example, users of www.Hulu.com can watch any of the available TV 
episodes and movies free of charge by viewing commercials periodi-
cally throughout each video.
Harnessing the power of social media—or 
not? Social media allows a business to reach out 
to customers in a context that is familiar and 
comfortable to them. Firms attempt to measure the 
effectiveness of their social media efforts by gathering 
statistics on the number of followers and fans they 
have, traffic to their Web sites, and mentions of their 
products on social networking sites. Whether or not 
this type of advertising results in additional sales can 
be difficult to tell. General Motors pulled its ads off 
of Facebook after deciding they weren't having much 
of an impact.

Part 5   Marketing
Social Media  In the last few years, the use of social 
media as an advertising medium has increased dra-
matically. This is largely due to the perception that 
marketers can target, interact with, and connect more 
personally with their customers through the different 
social-media outlets as opposed to more traditional 
media. Increasingly, customers expect companies 
to have an online presence. Most firms have a Web 
site and many also communicate information and 
relay promotions via Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. 
Businesses may also post advertisements on social media 
sites and blogs. Some companies also have their own branded 
sites that incorporate aspects and features of social media 
sites, but focus on their own brands and products. Even 
the President of the United States leverages social media to 
promote himself and his message. For example, President 
Obama released a 17-minute-long documentary narrated by 
Tom Hanks via YouTube. The documentary functioned like 
an extended advertisement in a campaign year and the presi-
dent’s staff hoped that it would go viral.10
While companies increasingly feel pressure to incorpo-
rate digital media, such as social networking sites, into their 
marketing mixes, research is not clear on the exact benefits 
of utilizing online social media for advertising. Social media 
can be a very low-cost advertising medium and it can be an 
excellent means for reaching a targeted audience, but social 
media sites are not as good at reaching broad or diverse audi-
ences. To contrast, a television ad broadcast during a major 
sporting event can reach millions of highly diverse viewers at 
once. Because of the smaller nature of Internet audiences and 
the problems of whether online customers actually see the pro-
motions, measuring the return on investment of social media 
advertising remains a challenge. Firms may measure things like 
followers and fans, traffic to a site, and social media mentions 
across other digital platforms, but marketers have a hard time 
translating this data into an estimate on return on investment. 
Nevertheless, most marketers feel that online social media are 
important tools and many firms have full-time social media 
experts on staff.11
Major Steps in Developing an Advertising Campaign
An advertising campaign is developed in several stages. These stages may vary in number 
and the order in which they are implemented depending on the company’s resources, 
products, and audiences. The development of a campaign in any organization, however, 
will include the following steps in some form:
1.  Identify and Analyze the Target Audience  The target audience is the group 
of people toward whom a firm’s advertisements are directed. To pinpoint the organi-
zation’s target audience and develop an effective campaign, marketers must analyze 
such information as the geographic distribution of potential customers; their age, sex, 
race, income, and education; and their attitudes toward both the advertiser’s product 
and competing products. How marketers use this information will be influenced by 
the features of the product to be advertised and the nature of the competition. Precise 
identification of the target audience is crucial to the proper development of subsequent

stages and, ultimately, to the success of the campaign itself. Rykä, 
for example, produces running shoes and accessories aimed at a 
target audience of female runners. It claims that its products are 
tailored to fit a woman’s foot shape and skeletal structure. As part 
of its promotional activities, the company partners with exercise 
programs, such as Jazzercize, that attract more women than men. 
It also features popular talk show host and avid runner, Kelly Ripa, 
as its spokeswoman.12
2.  Define the Advertising Objectives  The goals of an 
advertising campaign should be stated precisely and in measur-
able terms. The objectives should include the firm’s current posi-
tion, indicate how far and in what direction from that original 
reference point the company wishes to move, and specify a defi-
nite period of time for the achievement of the goals. Advertising 
objectives that focus on sales will stress increasing sales by a cer-
tain percentage or dollar amount or expanding the firm’s mar-
ket share. Communication objectives will emphasize increasing 
product or brand awareness, improving consumer attitudes, or 
conveying product information.
3.  Create the Advertising Platform  An advertising platform 
includes the important selling points or features that an advertiser 
wishes to incorporate into the advertising campaign. These features 
should be important to customers in their selection and use of a prod-
uct, and, if possible, they should be features that competing products 
lack. Although research into what consumers view as important issues 
is expensive, it is the most productive way to determine which issues 
to include in an advertising platform. For instance, customer research 
might indicate to the manufacturer of a cold-symptom reliever that 
customers want a product that relieves your coughing, stops your nose from running, 
and keeps your eyes from watering.
4.  Determine the Advertising Appropriation  The advertising appropriation is 
the total amount of money designated for advertising in a given period. This stage is 
critical to the campaign’s success because advertising efforts based on an inadequate 
budget will understimulate customer demand, and a budget too large will waste a com-
pany’s resources. Advertising appropriations may be based on last year’s (or next year’s 
forecasted) sales, on what competitors spend on advertising, or on executive judgment. 
Table 15.1 shows the nation’s top 20 advertising spenders. Procter & Gamble is tradi-
tionally one of the top spenders.
5.  Develop the Media Plan  A media plan specifies exactly which media will be 
used in the campaign and when advertisements will appear. For example, marketers 
are not likely to rely on digital media advertising to sell life insurance aimed at retired 
people because older consumers are not as likely to use the Internet as younger ones. 
Although cost-effectiveness is not easy to measure, the primary concern of the media 
planner is to reach the largest number of persons in the target audience for each dollar 
spent. In addition to cost, media planners must consider the location and demographics 
of people in the advertising target, the content of the message, and the characteristics of 
the audiences reached by various media. The media planner begins with general media 
decisions, selects subclasses within each medium, and, finally, chooses particular media 
vehicles for the campaign.
6.  Create the Advertising Message  The content and form of a message are 
influenced by the product’s features, the characteristics of people in the target

Pinpointing the target audience. Is this ad aimed at 
everyone? It's unlikely. Most ads are aimed at specific 
groups of consumers.

Part 5   Marketing
audience, the objectives of the campaign, and the 
choice of media. An advertiser must consider these 
factors when choosing words and illustrations that 
will be meaningful and appealing to persons in the 
advertising target. The copy, or words, of an adver-
tisement will vary depending on the media choice but 
should attempt to move the audience through atten-
tion, interest, desire, and action. Artwork and visuals 
should complement copy by attracting the audience’s 
attention and communicating an idea quickly. Creating a 
cohesive advertising message is especially difficult for a com-
pany such as eBay that offers such a broad mix of products. 
eBay developed a “whatever it is” campaign that features a 
variety of consumers representing all age groups using a vari-
ety of products (a car, a television, a dress, and a laptop) all 
shaped like the letters “it.” The tagline, “Whatever it is, you 
can get it on eBay,” emphasizes the massive range of products 
available from the site and effectively showcases the service 
that the company provides its customers.
7.  Execute the Campaign  The execution of an advertis-
ing campaign requires extensive planning, scheduling, and 
coordinating because many tasks must be completed on 
time. Many people and firms, such as production companies, 
research organizations, media firms, printers, photoengravers,

Think about the media plan an advertiser might use to 
reach you. When do you watch television? Do you ever 
pass any billboards? Which printed or online newspapers 
or magazines do you read? These are all questions a media 
planner would consider when choosing media for a target 
audience.

and commercial artists, may contribute to a campaign. Advertising managers con-
stantly must assess the quality of the work and take corrective action when necessary. 
Situations may also arise that require a change in plans. Designer Marc Jacobs’ market-
ing team had to scramble to release new advertisements after the initial print ad for its 
Oh, Lola! perfume was banned in the United Kingdom for being inappropriately erotic. 
Marc Jacobs’ marketing team responded by releasing some toned-down advertisements 
in its place.13
8.  Evaluate Advertising Effectiveness  A campaign’s success should be measured 
in terms of its original objectives before, during, and/or after the campaign. An adver-
tiser should at least be able to estimate whether sales or market share went up because 
of the campaign or whether any change occurred in customer attitudes or brand aware-
ness. Data from past and current sales and responses to coupon offers and customer 
surveys administered by research organizations are some of the ways in which advertis-
ing effectiveness can be evaluated. While most marketers agree that digital media and 
online social media are essential marketing tools, it can be difficult to gather measure-
ments on the effectiveness of online advertising, such as return on investment.14
Advertising Agencies
Advertisers can plan and produce their own advertising with help from media personnel, 
or they can hire advertising agencies. An advertising agency is an independent firm 
that plans, produces, and places advertising for its clients. Many large ad agencies 
offer help with sales promotion and public relations as well. The media usually pay a 
commission of 15 percent to advertising agencies. Thus, the cost to the agency’s client 
can be quite moderate. The client may be asked to pay for special services that the 
agency performs. Other methods for compensating agencies are also used.
Firms that do a lot of advertising may use both an in-house advertising department 
and an independent agency. This approach gives the firm the advantage of being able 
to call on the agency’s expertise in particular areas of advertising. An agency also can 
bring a fresh viewpoint to a firm’s products and advertising plans.
Via Ad Agency

Success

With 100 employees and annual revenues 
of $15 million, Via is a small advertising 
agency with big ideas. It was founded by John 
Coleman in 1993 and now operates from a historic 
19th-century building that once served as the public library of 
Portland, Maine. The award-winning agency is known as much 
for its responsive, results-oriented service as for its creativity 
in developing distinctive advertising campaigns that help its 
business clients achieve their promotion objectives.
The chief marketing officer of Samsung Electronics 
observes that Via’s creative experts are good listeners, work 
collaboratively with clients, and understand the need for 
measurable results. When Samsung introduced its Galaxy 
Tab tablet computer, which competes with Apple’s iPad, Via 
was able to crank up a multimedia launch program in only 
five weeks. Thanks in part to Via’s high-performing campaign, 
Samsung sold more than 1 million Galaxy Tabs in the first three 
months on the market.
Via’s expertise and service have attracted a growing roster 
of clients from different industries, including Unilever ice 
creams, Macaroni Grill restaurants, Perdue chicken products, 
and People’s United Bank. No wonder Advertising Age recently 
named Via the best small agency of the year.

Personal Selling 
Personal selling is the most adaptable of all promotional methods because the person 
who is presenting the message can modify it to suit the individual buyer. However, 
personal selling is also the most expensive method of promotion.
Most successful salespeople are able to communicate with others on a one-to-one 
basis and are strongly motivated. They strive to have a thorough knowledge of the prod-
ucts they offer for sale, and they are willing and able to deal with the 
details involved in handling and processing orders. Sales managers 
tend to emphasize these qualities when recruiting and hiring.
Many selling situations demand the face-to-face contact and 
adaptability of personal selling. This is especially true of industrial 
sales, in which a single purchase may amount to millions of dollars. 
Obviously, sales of that size must be based on carefully planned 
sales presentations, personal contact with customers, and thorough 
negotiations.
Kinds of Salespersons
Because most businesses employ different salespersons to perform 
different functions, marketing managers must select the kinds 
of sales personnel that will be most effective in selling the firm’s 
products. Salespersons may be identified as order-getters, order-
takers, and support personnel. A single individual can, and often 
does, perform all three functions.
Order-Getters  An order-getter is responsible for what is some-
times called creative selling—selling a firm’s products to new custom-
ers and increasing sales to current customers. An order-getter must 
perceive buyers’ needs, supply customers with information about the firm’s product, and 
persuade them to buy the product. Order-getting activities may be separated into two 
groups. In current-customer sales, salespeople concentrate on obtaining additional sales or 
leads for prospective sales from customers who have purchased the firm’s products at least 
once. In new-business sales, sales personnel seek out new prospects and convince them to 
make an initial purchase of the firm’s product. The real estate, insurance, appliance, heavy 
industrial machinery, and automobile industries in particular depend on new-business sales.
Order-Takers  An order-taker handles repeat sales in ways that maintain positive 
relationships with customers. An order-taker sees that customers have products when 
and where they are needed and in the proper amounts. Inside order-takers receive 
incoming mail and telephone orders in some businesses; salespersons in retail stores 
are also inside order-takers. Outside (or field) order-takers travel to customers. Often, 
the buyer and the field salesperson develop a mutually beneficial relationship of plac-
ing, receiving, and delivering orders. Both inside and outside order-takers are active 
salespersons and often produce most of their companies’ sales.
Support Personnel  Sales support personnel aid in selling but are more involved 
in locating prospects (likely first-time customers), educating customers, building good-
will for the firm, and providing follow-up service. The most common categories of 
support personnel are missionary, trade, and technical salespersons.
A missionary salesperson, who usually works for a manufacturer, visits retailers 
to persuade them to buy the manufacturer’s products. If the retailers agree, they buy the 
products from wholesalers, who are the manufacturer’s actual customers. Missionary 
salespersons often are employed by producers of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals 
to promote these products to retail druggists, physicians, and hospitals.

The pros and cons of personal selling. Personal 
selling is more effective than advertising. It's easy to 
ignore an advertisement. Saying "no" to a salesperson 
is much harder. The main drawback of personal selling 
is that it's expensive, which is why it's generally used to 
sell high-dollar goods and services.

company’s current customers in 
technical matters
A trade salesperson, who generally works for a food producer or processor, 
assists customers in promoting products, especially in retail stores. A trade salesperson 
may obtain additional shelf space for the products, restock shelves, set up displays, and 
distribute samples. Because trade salespersons usually are order-takers as well, they are 
not strictly support personnel.
A technical salesperson assists a company’s current customers in technical mat-
ters. He or she may explain how to use a product, how it is made, how to install it, or 
how a system is designed. A technical salesperson should be formally educated in sci-
ence or engineering. Computers, steel, and chemicals are some of the products handled 
by technical salespeople.
Marketers usually need sales personnel from several of these categories. Factors 
that affect hiring and other personnel decisions include the number of customers and 
their characteristics; the product’s attributes, complexity, and price; the distribution 
channels used by the company; and the company’s approach to advertising.
The Personal-Selling Process
No two selling situations are exactly alike, and no two salespeople perform their jobs 
in exactly the same way. Most salespeople, however, follow the six-step procedure 
illustrated in Figure 15.4.
Personal selling is not only the most adaptable of all promotional methods  
but also the most expensive.

Part 5   Marketing
Prospecting  The first step in personal selling is to research potential buyers and 
choose the most likely customers, or prospects. Sources of prospects include business 
associates and customers, public records, telephone and trade-association directories, 
and company files. The salesperson concentrates on those prospects that have the 
financial resources, willingness, and authority to buy the product.
Approaching the Prospect  First impressions are often lasting impressions. Thus, 
the salesperson’s first contact with the prospect is crucial to successful selling. The best 
approach is one based on knowledge of the product, of the prospect’s needs, and of 
how the product can meet those needs. Salespeople who understand each customer’s 
particular situation are likely to make a good first impression—and to make a sale.
Making the Presentation  The next step is actual delivery of the sales presentation. 
In many cases, this includes demonstrating the product. The salesperson points out the 
product’s features, its benefits, and how it is superior to competitors’ merchandise. If 
the product has been used successfully by other firms, the salesperson may mention 
this as part of the presentation.
During a demonstration, the salesperson may suggest that the prospect try out the 
product personally. The demonstration and product trial should underscore specific 
points made during the presentation.
Answering Objections  The prospect is likely to raise objections or ask questions at 
any time. This gives the salesperson a chance to eliminate objections that might prevent 
a sale, to point out additional features, or to mention special services the company offers.
Closing the Sale  To close the sale, the salesperson asks the prospect to buy the prod-
uct. This is considered the critical point in the selling process. Many experienced sales-
people make use of a trial closing, in which they ask questions based on the assumption 
that the customer is going to buy the product. The questions “When would you want 
delivery?” and “Do you want the standard model or the one with the special options 
package?” are typical of trial closings. They allow the reluctant prospect to make a 
purchase without having to say, “I’ll take it.”
Following-Up  The salesperson must follow up after the sale to ensure that the product 
is delivered on time, in the right quantity, and in proper operating condition. During 
follow-up, the salesperson also makes it clear that he or she is available in case problems 
develop. Follow-up leaves a good impression and eases the way toward future sales. 
Hence, it is essential to the selling process. The salesperson’s job does not end with a 
sale. It continues as long as the seller and the customer maintain a working relationship.
Managing Personal Selling
A firm’s success often hinges on the competent management of its sales force. Although 
some companies operate efficiently without a sales force, most firms rely on a strong 
sales force—and the sales revenue it brings in—for their success.
Sales managers have responsibilities in a number of areas. They must set sales 
objectives in concrete, quantifiable terms and specify a certain period of time and a 
certain geographic area. They must adjust the size of the sales force to meet changes in 
the firm’s marketing plan and the marketing environment. Sales managers must attract 
and hire effective salespersons. They must also develop a training program and decide 
where, when, how, and for whom to conduct the training. They must formulate a fair 
and adequate compensation plan to keep qualified employees. They must motivate 
salespersons to boost their productivity. They must define sales territories and deter-
mine scheduling and routing of the sales force. Finally, sales managers must evaluate 
the operation as a whole through sales reports, communications with customers, and 
invoices.

 Sales Promotion
Sales promotion consists of activities or materials that are direct inducements to 
customers or salespersons. Are you a member of an airline frequent-flyer program? 
Have you recently received a free sample in the mail or at a supermarket? How 
about a rebate from a manufacturer? Do you use coupons? All these are examples 
of sales promotion efforts. Sales promotion techniques often are used to enhance and 
supplement other promotional methods. They can have a significant impact on sales.
The dramatic increase in spending for sales promotion shows that marketers have 
recognized the potential of this promotional method. Many firms now include numer-
ous sales promotion efforts as part of their overall promotion mix.

Sales promotion activities may be used singly or in combination, both offensively 
and defensively, to achieve one goal or a set of goals. Marketers use sales promotion 
activities and materials for a number of purposes, including
	 1.	To attract new customers
	 2.	To encourage trial of a new product
	 3.	To invigorate the sales of a mature brand
	 4.	To boost sales to current customers
	 5.	To reinforce advertising
	 6.	To increase traffic in retail stores
	 7.	To steady irregular sales patterns
	 8.	To build up reseller inventories
	 9.	To neutralize competitive promotional efforts
	10.	To improve shelf space and displays
Sales Promotion Methods
Most sales promotion methods can be classified as promotional techniques for 
either consumer sales or trade sales. A consumer sales promotion method attracts 
consumers to particular retail stores and motivates them to purchase certain new or 
established products. A trade sales promotion method encourages wholesalers and 
retailers to stock and actively promote a manufacturer’s product. Incentives such as 
money, merchandise, marketing assistance, and gifts are commonly awarded to resellers 
who buy products or respond positively in other ways. Of the combined dollars spent 
on sales promotion and advertising, about one-half is spent on trade promotions, 
about one-fourth is spent on consumer promotions, and about one-fourth is spent on 
advertising.
A number of factors enter into marketing decisions about which and how many 
sales promotion methods to use. Of greatest importance are the objectives of the pro-
motional effort. Product characteristics—size, weight, cost, durability, uses, features, 
and hazards—and target market profiles—age, gender, income, location, density, usage 
rate, and buying patterns—likewise must be considered. Distribution channels and 
availability of appropriate resellers also influence the choice of sales promotion meth-
ods, as do the competitive and regulatory forces in the environment. Let’s now discuss 
a few important sales promotion methods.
Rebates  A rebate is a return of part of the product’s purchase price. Usually, this 
refund is offered to consumers who send in a coupon along with a specific proof of 
purchase. Rebating is a relatively low-cost promotional method. Once used mainly to 
help launch new product items, it is now applied to a wide variety of products. Some 
automakers offer rebates on their vehicles because they have found that many car 
customers are more likely to purchase a car with a rebate than the same car with a 
lower price and no rebate. One problem with rebates is that many people perceive the 
redemption process as too complicated. Only about half of individuals who purchase 
rebated products actually apply for the rebates.

Part 5   Marketing
Coupons  A coupon reduces the retail price of a 
particular item by a stated amount at the time of pur-
chase. They are made available to customers through 
newspapers, magazines, direct mail, online, and shelf 
dispensers in stores. Coupons are precisely targeted 
at customers. Many firms are utilizing the Internet to 
target customers with deals and distribute coupons. 
Constant Contact, for example, offers email and 
listerv managing capabilities for small businesses. 
Recently, the company unveiled a Groupon alternative called 
SaveLocal, which targets customers with specific coupon 
deals. The service allows businesses to focus on existing cus-
tomers and provides incentives, chosen by the company, for 
those customers to notify others about the deals. This method 
is a low-cost way of promoting a company’s products or ser-
vices among a customer base that will use and appreciate the 
service. So far, Constant Contact reports that businesses that 
use the service have found that around 20 percent of coupon 
users are new to the company, which means the service is 
effectively attracting new customers.15
Although coupon use had been declining steadily for sev-
eral years, the recent recession caused coupon usage to increase. 
In 2009, businesses issued 367 billion coupons, the highest level 
in 30 years. Consumers redeemed 3.3 billion coupons, a 27 per-
cent increase over the previous year, making it the first time in 17 years that consumers 
used more coupons than they did the year before. In 2010, redemption remained the 
same, which is interesting according to Bob Carter, President of Inmar’s Promotion 
Services, because “the change in consumer behavior that led to drastic increases in 
coupon redemption during the economic crisis is holding post-recession.”16 The largest 
number of coupons distributed are for household cleaners, condiments, frozen foods, 
medications and health aids, and paper products. Stores in some areas even deduct 
double or triple the value of manufacturers’ coupons from the purchase price as a sales 
promotion technique of their own. Coupons also may offer free merchandise, either 
with or without an additional product purchase.
Samples  A sample is a free product given to customers to encourage trial and pur-
chase. Marketers use free samples to stimulate the trial of a product, increase sales vol-
ume in the early stages of a product’s life-cycle, and obtain desirable 
distribution. Samples may be offered via online coupons, direct mail, 
or in stores. Many customers prefer to receive their samples by mail. 
Providing samples remains the most expensive sales promotion tech-
nique. Although it is used often to promote new products, it can also 
be used to promote established brands. For example, cosmetics com-
panies may use samples to attract customers. Coca-Cola often gives 
out free samples of products such as Vitaminwater at business con-
ventions, concerts, and sporting events. In designing a free sample, 
organizations must consider such factors as seasonal demand for the 
product, market characteristics, and prior advertising.
Not all samples are free. Some companies have realized that 
customers will pay a small fee to have regular access to high-end 
samples. Birchbox is an online company that, for $10 a month, ships 
customers a monthly box of a variety of high-end beauty product 
samples. While these samples are not free, customers appreciate the 
low-cost means of trying out new products and the convenience 
of having the products shipped directly to their doors. The Sample 
Society offers a similar service for $15 a month and includes beauty 
tips from Allure magazine editors.17
"Try it! You'll like it!" Companies give away coupons 
to increase the sales of their products and encourage 
consumers who are unfamiliar with them to give them 
a try.

Premiums  A premium is a gift that a producer offers a customer in return for buy-
ing its product. They are used to attract competitors’ customers, introduce different 
sizes of established products, add variety to other promotional efforts, and stimu-
late consumer loyalty. Creativity is essential when using premiums; to stand out and 
achieve a significant number of redemptions, the premium must match both the target 
audience and the brand’s image. Examples include a service station giving a free car 
wash with a fill-up, a free toothbrush available with a tube of toothpaste, and a free 
plastic storage box given with the purchase of Kraft Cheese Singles. Premiums also 
must be easily recognizable and desirable. Premiums are placed on or inside packages 
and also can be distributed through retailers or through the mail.
Frequent-User Incentives  A frequent-user incentive is a program developed 
to reward customers who engage in repeat (frequent) purchases. Such programs are 
used commonly by service businesses such as airlines, hotels, and auto rental agencies. 
Frequent-user incentives foster customer loyalty to a specific company or group of 
cooperating companies because the customer is given an additional reason to continue 
patronizing the business. For example, most major airlines offer frequent-flyer programs 
that reward customers who have flown a specified number of miles with free tickets 
for additional travel. There is significant evidence that airline miles are highly valued by 
customers. Now, more frequent-flyer miles are awarded by non-airline companies than 
by airline companies. A high proportion of upper-income customers use frequent-user 
programs, whereas moderate-income customers are not as likely to use these programs.
Point-of-Purchase Displays  A point-of-purchase display is promotional mate-
rial placed within a retail store. The display is usually located near the product being 
promoted. It may actually hold merchandise, or it may simply inform customers about 
what the product offers and encourage them to buy it. Most point-of-purchase displays 
are prepared and set up by manufacturers and wholesalers.
Trade Shows  A trade show is an industry-wide exhibit at which many sellers dis-
play their products. Some trade shows are organized exclusively for dealers—to permit 
manufacturers and wholesalers to show their latest lines to retailers. Others are events 
designed to stimulate consumer awareness and interest. Among the 
latter are boat shows, home shows, and flower shows put on each 
year in large cities. E3, for example, is the world’s largest trade show 
for electronic games and related products. Tens of thousands attend 
this trade show each year, including all major producers of gaming 
products, to see the new products being showcased and to network 
with professionals in the industry.18
Buying Allowances  A buying allowance is a temporary price 
reduction to resellers for purchasing specified quantities of a prod-
uct. For example, a laundry detergent manufacturer might give 
retailers $1 for each case of detergent purchased. A buying allow-
ance may serve as an incentive to resellers to handle new products 
and may stimulate purchases in large quantities. While the buying 
allowance is simple, straightforward, and easily administered, com-
petitors can respond quickly by offering a better buying allowance.
Cooperative Advertising  Cooperative advertising is an 
arrangement whereby a manufacturer agrees to pay a certain 
amount of a retailer’s media cost for advertising the manufacturer’s 
products. To be reimbursed, a retailer must show proof that the 
advertisements actually did appear. A large percentage of all coop-
erative advertising dollars is spent on newspaper advertisements.

Using trade shows to generate interest in 
products. Trade shows help marketers make their 
products visible to a large number of businesses and 
consumers. The shows also allow companies to keep 
an eye on what their competitors are doing and the 
new products they are launching. In this photo, rapper 
50 Cent is promoting a product at the International 
Consumer Electronics Show held in Las Vegas.

story form about an organization, 
its products, or both

Public Relations
As noted earlier, public relations is a broad set of communication activities used to 
create and maintain favorable relationships between an organization and various public 
groups, both internal and external. These groups can include customers, employees, 
stockholders, suppliers, educators, the media, government officials, and society in 
general.
Types of Public-Relations Tools
Organizations use a variety of public-relations tools to convey messages and to create 
images. Public-relations professionals prepare written materials such as brochures, 
newsletters, company magazines, annual reports, and news releases. They also create 
corporate-identity materials such as logos, business cards, signs, and stationery. 
Speeches are another public-relations tool. Speeches can affect an organization’s image 
and therefore must convey the desired message clearly.
Another public-relations tool is event sponsorship, in which a company pays for 
all or part of a special event such as a concert, sports competition, festival, or play. 
Sponsoring special events is an effective way for organizations to increase brand recog-
nition and receive media coverage with comparatively little investment. The Big Apple 
Barbeque Block Party, for example, is a weekend-long event that occurs every June in 
New York’s Madison Square Park, and features free live music and cooking demon-
strations. Barbeque enthusiasts can purchase plates of food from some of the country’s 
top pitmasters, and all proceeds go to the Madison Square Park 
Conservancy, which maintains the park. Several companies spon-
sor this event to help promote their brand and the event’s charity, 
including Coca-Cola, Ikea, Dyson, and Southern Living.19
Some public-relations tools have been traditionally associated 
with publicity, which is a part of public relations. Publicity is com-
munication in news-story form about an organization, its prod-
ucts, or both. Publicity is transmitted through a mass medium, such 
as newspapers or radio, at no charge. Organizations use publicity 
to provide information about products; to announce new product 
launches, expansions, or research; and to strengthen the company’s 
image. Public-relations personnel sometimes organize events, such 
as grand openings with prizes and celebrities, to create news stories 
about a company.
The most widely used type of publicity is the news release. 
It is generally one typed page of about 300 words provided by 
an organization to the media as a form of publicity. The release 
includes the firm’s name, address, phone number, and contact 
person. Table 15.2 lists some of the issues news releases can 
address. There are also several other kinds of publicity-based 
public-relations tools. A feature article, which may run as long 
as 3,000 words, is usually written for inclusion in a particular publication. For 
example, a software firm might send an article about its new product to a computer 
magazine. A captioned photograph, a picture accompanied by a brief explana-
tion, is an effective way to illustrate a new or improved product. A press confer-
ence allows invited media personnel to hear important news announcements and 
to receive supplementary textual materials and photographs. Finally, letters to the 
editor, special newspaper or magazine editorials, and videos may be prepared and 
distributed to appropriate media for possible use.
The Uses of Public Relations
Public relations can be used to promote people, places, activities, ideas, and even 
countries. Public relations focuses on enhancing the reputation of the total organization 
by making people aware of a company’s products, brands, or activities and by creating

specific company images such as that of innovativeness or dependability. Social 
media sites, YouTube, and Twitter can all be great low-cost tools for connecting with 
consumers and engaging in a dialogue. However, the social media landscape is changing 
fast. Public relations experts and other marketers must keep track of a growing list of 
small, niche social media sites. Smaller social media sites that focus on a specific area of 
interest can be an easy way to target a specific audience. For instance, Tennisopolis is a 
social media site for tennis enthusiasts and Lookk is a site for fashion enthusiasts and 
designers. Advertising on sites like these help a brand establish its image and reach its 
specific target audience. These sites can also be good resources for marketers looking 
to discover customer needs and wants and new trends.20
Promotion Planning
A promotional campaign is a plan for combining and using the four promotional 
methods—advertising, personal selling, sales promotion, and public relations—in a 
particular promotion mix to achieve one or more marketing goals. When selecting 
promotional methods to include in promotion mixes, it is important to coordinate 
promotional elements to maximize the total informational and promotional impact 
on customers. Integrated marketing communication requires a marketer to look at the 
broad perspective when planning promotional programs and coordinating the total set 
of communication functions.
In planning a promotional campaign, marketers must answer these two questions:
	 1.	What will be the role of promotion in the overall marketing mix?
	 2.	To what extent will each promotional method be used in the promotion mix?
The answer to the first question depends on the firm’s marketing objectives because 
the role of each element of the marketing mix—product, price, distribution, and pro-
motion—depends on these detailed versions of the firm’s marketing goals. The answer 
to the second question depends on the answer to the first, as well as on the target 
market.

influence the selection of 
promotion-mix ingredients.

Part 5   Marketing
Promotion and Marketing Objectives
Promotion is naturally better suited to certain marketing objectives than to others. 
For example, promotion can do little to further a marketing objective such as “reduce 
delivery time by one-third.” It can, however, be used to inform customers that delivery 
is faster. Let’s consider some objectives that would require the use of promotion as a 
primary ingredient of the marketing mix.
Providing Information  This is, of course, the main function of promotion. It may 
be used to communicate to target markets the availability of new products or product 
features. It may alert them to special offers or give the locations of retailers that carry 
a firm’s products. In other words, promotion can be used to enhance the effectiveness 
of each of the other ingredients of the marketing mix.
Increasing Market Share  Promotion can be used to convince new custom-
ers to try a product while maintaining the product loyalty of established customers. 
Comparative advertising, for example, is directed mainly at those who might—but 
presently do not—use a particular product. Advertising that emphasizes the prod-
uct’s features also assures those who do use the product that they have made a smart 
choice. Nature Valley, maker of granola bars, unveiled a new campaign that seeks to 
increase its already dominant share of the granola bar market. The campaign features 
a Web site called Nature Valley Trail View, which allows users to virtually hike trails 
in U.S. national parks. This new promotional campaign is aimed at capturing greater 
market share by further aligning the Nature Valley brand name with a healthy outdoor 
lifestyle. Nature Valley gained a 3.9 percent market share and now commands a 
41.6 percent share of the market.21
Positioning the Product  The sales of a product depend, to a great extent, on 
its competition. The stronger the competition, the more difficult it is to maintain or 
increase sales. For this reason, many firms go to great lengths to position their prod-
ucts in the marketplace. Positioning is the development of a product image in buyers’ 
minds relative to the images they have of competing products.
Promotion is the prime positioning tool. A marketer can use promotion to posi-
tion a brand away from competitors to avoid competition. Promotion also may be 
used to position one product directly against another product. For example, in hopes 
of providing legitimate competition to Apple’s iPhone, Motorola is offering the Droid. 
Looking at its advertising, there is no doubt which phone it is competing against. With 
statements about its competition like “iDon’t have a real keyboard, iDon’t allow open 
development, and iDon’t take pictures in the dark,” it is very clear that the Droid is 
positioned head to head with the iPhone.22
Stabilizing Sales  Special promotional efforts can be used to increase sales during 
slack periods, such as the “off season” for certain sports equipment. By stabilizing sales 
in this way, a firm can use its production facilities more effectively and reduce both 
capital costs and inventory costs. Promotion is also used frequently to increase the sales 
of products that are in the declining stage of their life-cycles. The objective is to keep 
them going for a little while longer.
Developing the Promotion Mix
Once the role of promotion is established, the various methods of promotion may be 
combined in a promotional campaign. As in so many other areas of business, promotion 
planning begins with a set of specific objectives. The promotion mix then is designed 
to accomplish these objectives.
Marketers often use several promotion mixes simultaneously if a firm sells mul-
tiple products. The selection of promotion-mix ingredients and the degree to which

a product image in buyers’ minds 
relative to the images they have of 
competing products

they are used depend on the organization’s resources and objectives, the nature of the 
target market, the characteristics of the product, and the feasibility of various promo-
tional methods.
The amount of promotional resources available in an organization influences the 
number and intensity of promotional methods that marketers can use. A firm with 
a limited budget for promotion probably will rely on personal selling because the 
effectiveness of personal selling can be measured more easily than that of advertis-
ing. An organization’s objectives also have an effect on its promotional activities. A 
company wishing to make a wide audience familiar with a new convenience item 
probably will depend heavily on advertising and sales promotion. If a company’s 
objective is to communicate information to consumers—on the features of counter-
top appliances, for example—then the company may develop a promotion mix that 
includes some advertising, some sales promotion to attract consumers to stores, and 
a lot of personal selling.
The size, geographic distribution, and socioeconomic characteristics of the target 
market play a part in the composition of a product’s promotion mix. If the market is 
small, personal selling probably will be the most important element in the promotion 
mix. This is true of organizations that sell to small industrial markets and businesses 
that use only a few wholesalers to market their products. Companies that need to 
contact millions of potential customers, however, will emphasize sales promotion and 
advertising because these methods are relatively inexpensive. The age, income, and 
education of the target market also will influence the choice of promotion techniques. 
For example, with less-educated consumers, personal selling may be more effective 
than ads in newspapers or magazines.
In general, industrial products require a considerable amount of personal selling, 
whereas consumer goods depend on advertising. This is not true in every case, how-
ever. The price of the product also influences the composition of the promotion mix. 
Because consumers often want the advice of a salesperson on an expensive product, 
high-priced consumer goods may call for more personal selling. Similarly, advertising 
and sales promotion may be more crucial to marketers of seasonal items because hav-
ing a year-round sales force is not always appropriate.
The cost and availability of promotional methods are important factors in 
the development of a promotion mix. Although national advertising and sales 
promotion activities are expensive, the cost per customer may be quite small if the 
campaign succeeds in reaching large numbers of people. In addition, local adver-
tising outlets—newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations, and outdoor 
displays—may not be that costly for a small local business. In some situations, 
a firm may find that no available advertising medium reaches the target market 
effectively.
Criticisms of Promotion 
Even though promotional activities can help customers to make informed purchasing 
decisions, social scientists, consumer groups, government agencies, and members of 
society in general have long criticized promotion. There are two main reasons for 
such criticism: Promotion does have some flaws, and it is a highly visible business 
activity that pervades our daily lives. Although people almost universally complain that 
there is simply too much promotional activity, several more specific issues have been 
raised. Promotional efforts have been called deceptive. Promotion has been blamed 
for increasing prices. Other criticisms of promotion are that it manipulates consumers 
into buying products they do not need, that it leads to a more materialistic society, that 
customers do not benefit sufficiently from promotion to justify its high costs, and that 
promotion is used to market potentially harmful products. These issues are discussed 
in Table 15.3.
Identify and explain the 
criticisms of promotion.

Criticisms of Promotion
Issue
Discussion
Is promotion deceptive?
Although no longer widespread, some deceptive promotion still occurs; laws, government 
regulations, and industry self-regulation have helped to decrease intentionally deceptive 
promotion; however, customers may be unintentionally misled because some words have diverse 
meanings.
Does promotion  
increase prices?
When promotion stimulates demand, higher production levels may result in lower per-unit 
production costs, which keeps prices lower; when demand is not stimulated, however, prices 
increase owing to the added costs of promotion; promotion fuels price competition, which helps 
to keep prices lower.
Does promotion  
create needs?
Many marketers capitalize on consumers’ needs by basing their promotional appeals on these 
needs; however, marketers do not actually create these needs. If there were no promotion, 
consumers would still have basic needs such as those suggested by Maslow.
Does promotion 
encourage materialism?
Because promotion creates awareness and visibility for products, it may contribute to 
materialism in the same way that movies, sports, theater, art, and literature may contribute to 
materialism; if there were no promotion, it is likely that there would still be materialism among 
some groups, as evidenced by the existence of materialism among some ancient groups of 
people.
Does promotion help 
customers without 
costing too much?
Customers learn about products and services through promotion, allowing them to make more 
intelligent buying decisions.
Should potentially 
harmful products be 
promoted?
Some critics suggest that the promotion of possibly unhealthy products should not be allowed 
at all; others argue that as long as it is legal to sell such products, promoting those products 
should be allowed.
Inside
Business
Sales of Procter & Gamble’s Old Spice men’s grooming 
products have hit new highs, thanks to award-winning inte-
grated marketing communications that brought the brand 
new prominence and a hip new attitude. Most of the cam-
paigns are national, although some are quirkily local. For 
one holiday campaign, Mustafa appeared as a Santa Claus–
type character (clad in a towel plus a wool scarf) on local 
billboards, on television commercials, and in newspaper 
ads, commenting on uniquely local situations and sights.
More recently, another football player, Terry Crews, 
has represented the power of Old Spice body spray by 
muscling through walls during commercials for other 
Procter & Gamble products such as Bounce fabric soft-
ener and Charmin toilet tissue. Crews tells the audience: 
“It’s so powerful, it sells itself in other people’s commer-
cials!” Once again, these fun ads became viral hits for Old 
Spice and its parent company.
Questions
1.	 What selling points seem to be in the advertising plat-
form for Old Spice’s commercials, and how do these 
points relate to the target audience’s needs or inter-
ests?
2.	 When Old Spice wins advertising awards and people 
talk about its unusual campaigns, how does that help 
the rest of the brand’s promotional efforts?

and its products that is intended to inform, persuade, or 
remind target-market members. The major ingredients of 
a promotion mix are advertising, personal selling, sales 
promotion, and public relations. The role of promotion is 
to facilitate exchanges directly or indirectly and to help an 
organization maintain favorable relationships with groups in 
the marketing environment.
Explain the purposes of the three types of 
advertising.
Advertising is a paid nonpersonal message communicated 
to a specific audience through a mass medium. Primary-
demand advertising promotes the products of an entire 
industry rather than just a single brand. Selective-demand 
advertising promotes a particular brand of product. 
Institutional advertising is image-building advertising for 
a firm.
Describe the advantages and disadvantages of 
the major advertising media.
The major advertising media are newspapers, magazines, 
direct mail, out-of-home displays, television, radio, the 
Internet, and social media. Newspapers are relatively 
inexpensive compared with other media, reach only people 
in the market area, and are timely. Disadvantages include a 
short life span, poor color reproduction, and an inability to 
target specific demographic groups. Magazine advertising 
can be quite prestigious. In addition, it can reach very 
specific market segments, can provide high-quality color 
reproduction, and has a relatively long life span. Major 
disadvantages are high cost and lack of timeliness. Direct 
mail is the most selective medium, and its effectiveness is 
measured easily. The disadvantage of direct mail is that if the 
mailing list is outdated and the advertisement does not reach 
the right people, then the campaign cannot be successful. 
Yellow Pages advertising allows customers who use it to 
save time in finding products, to find information quickly, 
and to learn about products and marketers. Unlike other 
types of advertising media, Yellow Pages advertisements 
are purchased for one year and cannot be changed. Out-of-
home advertising allows marketers to focus on a particular 
geographic area and is relatively inexpensive. Messages, 
though, must be limited to a few words because the audience 
is usually in transit.
Television accounts for the largest share of advertising 
expenditures. Television offers marketers the opportunity to 
broadcast a firm’s message nationwide. However, television 
advertising can be very expensive and has a short life span. 
In addition, cable channels and home videos have reduced 
the likelihood of reaching extremely large audiences. Radio 
advertising offers selectivity, can be less expensive than other 
media, and is flexible for scheduling purposes. Radio’s limi-
tations include no visual presentation and fragmented, small 
audiences. Benefits of using the Internet as an advertising 
medium include the growing number of people using the 
Internet, which means a growing audience, and the ability 
to precisely target specific customers. Disadvantages include 
the relatively simplistic nature of the ads that can be pro-
duced, especially in comparison with television, and the lack 
of evidence that net browsers actually pay attention to the 
ads. Social media appear to allow marketers the ability to 
target, interact, and connect more personally with customers 
through sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and brand-specific 
Web sites. Drawbacks are that the audience is restricted to 
followers, marketers are still unsure of the usefulness and 
return on investment, and companies must have employees 
dedicated to real-time activity.
Identify the major steps in developing an 
advertising campaign.
An advertising campaign is developed in several stages. A 
firm’s first task is to identify and analyze its advertising target. 
The goals of the campaign also must be clearly defined. Then 
the firm must develop the advertising platform, or statement 
of important selling points, and determine the size of the 
advertising budget. The next steps are to develop a media 
plan, to create the advertising message, and to execute the 
campaign. Finally, promotion managers must evaluate the 
effectiveness of the advertising efforts before, during, and/or 
after the campaign.
Recognize the various kinds of salespersons, the 
steps in the personal-selling process, and the 
major sales management tasks.
Personal selling is personal communication aimed at 
informing customers and persuading them to buy a firm’s 
products. It is the most adaptable promotional method 
because the salesperson can modify the message to fit each 
buyer. Three major kinds of salespersons are order-getters, 
order-takers, and support personnel. The six steps in the 
personal-selling process are prospecting, approaching the 
prospect, making the presentation, answering objections, 
closing the sale, and following up. Sales managers are 
involved directly in setting sales force objectives; recruiting, 
selecting, and training salespersons; compensating and

Describe sales promotion objectives and 
methods.
Sales promotion is the use of activities and materials as direct 
inducements to customers and salespersons. The primary 
objective of sales promotion methods is to enhance and 
supplement other promotional methods. Methods of sales 
promotion include rebates, coupons, samples, premiums, 
frequent-user incentives, point-of-purchase displays, trade 
shows, buying allowances, and cooperative advertising.
Understand the types and uses of public 
relations.
Public relations is a broad set of communication activities 
used to create and maintain favorable relationships between 
an organization and various public groups, both internal 
and external. Organizations use a variety of public-relations 
tools to convey messages and create images. Brochures, 
newsletters, company magazines, and annual reports are 
written public-relations tools. Speeches, event sponsorship, 
and publicity are other public-relations tools. Publicity is 
communication in news-story form about an organization, 
its products, or both. Types of publicity include news 
releases, feature articles, captioned photographs, and press 
conferences. Public relations can be used to promote people, 
places, activities, ideas, and even countries. It can be used to 
enhance the reputation of an organization and also to reduce 
the unfavorable effects of negative events.

Identify the factors that influence the selection of 
promotion-mix ingredients.
A promotional campaign is a plan for combining and using 
advertising, personal selling, sales promotion, and publicity 
to achieve one or more marketing goals. Campaign objectives 
are developed from marketing objectives. Then the promotion 
mix is developed based on the organization’s promotional 
resources and objectives, the nature of the target market, 
the product characteristics, and the feasibility of various 
promotional methods.
Identify and explain the criticisms of promotion.
Promotion activities can help consumers to make informed 
purchasing decisions, but they also have evoked many 
criticisms. Promotion has been accused of deception. 
Although some deceiving or misleading promotions do exist, 
laws, government regulation, and industry self-regulation 
minimize deceptive promotion. Promotion has been blamed 
for increasing prices, but it usually tends to lower them. When 
demand is high, production and marketing costs decrease, 
which can result in lower prices. Promotion also helps to keep 
prices lower by facilitating price competition. Other criticisms 
of promotional activity are that it manipulates consumers 
into buying products they do not need, that it leads to a 
more materialistic society, and that consumers do not benefit 
sufficiently from promotional activity to justify its high cost. 
Finally, some critics of promotion suggest that potentially 
harmful products, especially those associated with violence, 
sex, and unhealthy activities, should not be promoted at all.

Perhaps best known for its beloved mail-order catalog, L.L.Bean 
was recently placed near the top of Photobrand’s list of New 
England’s most powerful brands, beating Ethan Allen and Yankee 
Candle. L.L.Bean has grown from its founding as a one-product 
firm in 1912 to a national brand with 14 stores in 10 different 
states and a thriving online store. Net sales are over $1.5 billion  
a year.
Marketing communications are more sophisticated now than 
they were when Leon Leonwood Bean created his first product, a 
waterproof boot, and publicized it with a homemade brochure. In 
its early days, the firm thrived on word-of-mouth communication 
about its reliability and the expert advice of its founder, himself 
an avid outdoorsman. Determined to build his company and his 
mailing list, Bean poured all of the company’s profits into adver-
tising and talked about the company with one and all. Said one 
neighbor at the time, “If you drop in just to shake his hand, you 
get home to find his catalog in your mailbox.”
Now the company makes use of marketing database systems 
to manage and update its mailing lists. The L.L.Bean catalog 
swelled in size in the 1980s and 1990s, but it has slimmed down 
as the company’s Web site has taken over some of the task of 
promoting the company’s products. The catalog, still a major 
communication tool for the firm, is also a multiple-industry 
award-winner. The company uses computer-modeling tools to 
help it identify what customers want and sends them only the 
catalogs they desire. Still, says the vice president of stores, “What 
we find is most customers want some sort of touch point,” and 
the catalog remains very popular.
Online orders recently surpassed mail and phone orders for 
the first time in the company’s history. The relationship between 
the catalog and the Web site is complicated. As L.L.Bean’s vice 
president for e-commerce explains, customers have begun to 
shift much of their buying to the Internet, but they still rely on 
the catalog to browse, plan, and get ideas. Customers take their 
L.L.Bean catalogs “to soccer games, they read them in the car,” 
she says. “What’s changed is what they do next”—often they go 
online to find more details about an item or to place an order.
L.L.Bean still places print advertising, sometimes small ads 
that simply offer a free catalog or remind customers that they 
already have the catalog at home. Since the catalog is expensive 
to produce, the company tries to support it with other market-
ing media so it doesn’t get lost among all the other messages 
demanding customers’ attention.
A big and growing area for the company’s promotion efforts is 
the Internet, where it uses banner ads on popular sites like Hulu.
com allowing customers to click through to the L.L.Bean online 
store. It also maintains a Facebook page, a Twitter account, and 
a YouTube channel. The company invests heavily in television 
advertising as well, particularly around the holidays. Local TV ads 
are concentrated in the areas around the company’s retail stores.

Part 5   Marketing
L.L.Bean doesn’t take the wide familiarity of its brand for 
granted. It also promotes its name through partnerships with 
environmentally conscious companies and organizations and 
through charitable giving, mainly to organizations committed to 
maintaining and protecting Earth’s natural resources. The com-
pany recognizes, however, that a good product is at the heart of 
its success. “We really want to sell a good product, and we really 
guarantee that product,” says the company’s vice president of 
e-commerce. “We want to keep . . . the customer happy and keep 
that customer coming back to L.L.Bean over and over.”23
Questions
1.	 What are the ingredients of L.L.Bean’s promotion mix?
2.	 L.L.Bean is reaching into “alternative” promotons, including 
outfitting Weather Channel meteorologists around the United 
States and emblazoning its name on the tarp used by the 
Red Sox baseball team to protect the field during rain delays. 
What other kinds of promotional activities do you think 
would suit the company’s outdoorsy image?
3.	 Do you think L.L.Bean’s Web site will ever entirely take the 
place of its mail-order catalog? Why or why not?
For many years, Toyota set the standard for quality and reliabil-
ity. However, Toyota’s success was cut short by a desire to grow 
rapidly at the expense of quality. A few years ago, Toyota issued 
a series of recalls on several of their popular models because of 
safety problems with accelerators, brakes, and power steering. 
The recalls affected more than 8 million vehicles across five con-
tinents. Following the announcement of the recalls, Toyota engi-
neers and mechanics began to search for solutions to the prob-
lems and started the process of repairing millions of cars. The 
company also temporarily suspended production in the United 
States while it researched the causes of the problems. Many critics 
accused the company of acting too slowly to recall the defective 
cars and of trying to push the problem under the rug. Because 
of the negative press, Toyota sales declined significantly. Toyota 
president Akio Toyoda admitted, “We so aggressively pursued 
numbers that we were unable to keep up with training staff to 
oversee quality.” Toyoda also recognized that Toyota was slow to 
act on reports of problems provided by consumers.
Toyota was fined $16.4 million for allegedly hiding safety 
defects from consumers. This came after their reputation was 
already tarnished by a seemingly endless number of recalls on vari-
ous car models. Toward the end of the various safety recalls related 
to sudden acceleration, the 2010 Lexus GX460 was declared unsafe 
to buy by Consumer Reports. Toyota became the target for late-night 
television jokes and seemed to constantly be in the news regarding 
yet another recall. This negative publicity damaged the reputation 
and goodwill that Toyota had developed over many years.
In the wake of massive recalls, Toyota had to adjust its adver-
tising strategy. The world’s largest automaker pulled its national 
advertising campaign that promoted its cars for dependability, 
safety, and reliability. Toyota, which had long been the leader in 
automotive quality, had to scramble to figure out how to handle 
a growing public relations crisis resulting from recalls and even a 
halt in sales. All experts agreed that Toyota had to move quickly 
in an attempt to restore trust and deal with a crisis resulting 
from millions of recalled vehicles. A series of ads were developed 
to deal directly with the crisis and admit that the company had 
strayed from keeping its eye on quality while its sales had been 
growing rapidly. A number of low-key ads dealt directly with the 
issue and promised to regain consumers’ trust.
Initially, Toyota tried to tackle the recall problem by address-
ing individual nations or sales territories. The company thought 
it could deal with the issue in different ways in different markets. 
The company forgot that social networking sites quickly highlight 
product-related problems through global digital media. As the larg-
est auto manufacturer in the world, Toyota faced a global problem 
and found that it could not control information in different ter-
ritories. Toyota violated the first rule of crisis management by not 
responding quickly, but when the company did respond, it took out 
full-page ads in major newspapers and produced feel-good televi-
sion spots featuring dealers, mechanics, and owners. The company 
offered no-interest loans, discount leases, and a complementary 
two-year maintenance program to get buyers back.
In addition to repairing its vehicles, Toyota had to repair its rep-
utation. Shortly after the recalls, Toyota established a global quality 
committee and promised to appoint chief quality officers for each 
of its regions. Toyota is also in the process of designing new safety 
systems and inspection processes for its vehicles. All future models 
will include a new brake-override system designed to activate the 
brakes in the event that both the brake and accelerator pedals are 
pushed down. Additionally, Toyota will have a third party test its 
electronic acceleration system. Ultimately, it will take more than 
committees, promises, and programs to rebuild Toyota. 
Recently, Toyota has launched an innovative advertising cam-
paign focusing on a new slogan for the Camry. “It’s ready. Are 
you?” is a way to show that Toyota is recovering after the recalls 
and declined production that tarnished its reputation. Toyota is 
not only focused on safety, quality, and durability, but also creating 
a new image of the Camry as a desirable car that people want to 
purchase. Two years ago, the flooding in Thailand and earthquakes 
in Japan resulted in a 54 percent reduction in Toyota’s profits. 
Regardless of these more recent setbacks, Toyota is still challenging 
consumers to start putting their trust back into the company. By 
showing readiness through this new advertising campaign, Toyota 
is hoping to regain consumer trust and market share.24

2.	 Shortly after the recalls, Toyota cancelled its advertising cam-
paign regarding dependability, safety, and reliability. Was this 
action necessary? Why or why not?
3.	 Toyota received a considerable amount of negative publicity 
during and shortly after the recalls. What could Toyota have 
done to reduce the amount of negative coverage?
1 	SOCIAL MEDIA EXERCISE
Since companies began using social media to market products, one 
of the most successful marketing campaigns was Old Spice’s “The 
Man You Wish Your Man Could Smell Like” with Isaiah Mustafa. You 
can check out the case study that describes not only the campaign, 
but also how it increased brand awareness and profits at http://
wearesocial.net/blog/2010/08/wieden-kennedys-spice-case-study.
1.	 What factors do you think made the initial Old Spice market-
ing campaign so successful? 
2.	 Do you feel the way Wieden+Kennedy used comments from 
consumers and celebrities to create the “Response Campaign” 
was a smart and effective way to continue the Old Spice cam-
paign. Why or why not?
3.	 After the initial Old Spice marketing campaign, the advertising 
agency Wieden+Kennedy created a new generation of adver-
tisements for Old Spice. You can check out new advertise-
ments at www.wk.com. Once at the site, click on “Clients.” 
Then click on Old Spice to view current advertisements for 
this product.  Compare the original advertisements with the 
new advertisements. Which advertisements do the best job of 
promoting the Old Spice product?  Justify your opinions.
2 	JOURNALING FOR SUCCESS
Discovery statement: As this chapter showed, advertising is an 
important part of an organization’s promotional mix.
Assignment
1.	 During the last year, you have been exposed to a number 
of television advertisements. Identify and describe what you 
believe to be the best TV commercial that you have experi-
enced over the last year.
2.	 Why do you feel that this ad is the very best?
3.	 Describe the content of this advertisement in as much detail 
as possible, and explain what you can recall about this televi-
sion advertisement.
3 	DEVELOPING CRITICAL-THINKING SKILLS
Obviously, salespeople must know the products they are selling, 
but to give successful sales presentations, they also must know 
their competition. Armed with information about competing 
products, they are better able to field prospective customers’ 
questions and objections regarding their own products.
Assignment
1.	 Choose a product or service offered by one company and 
gather samples of the competitors’ sales literature.
2.	 After examining the competitors’ sales literature, answer the 
following questions:
a.	 What type of literature do the competitors use to advertise 
their product or service? Do they use full-color brochures?
b.	 Do they use videotapes?
c.	 Do they offer giveaways or special discounts?
3.	 Compare the product or service you chose with what the 
competition is selling.
4.	 Compile a list of all the strengths and weaknesses you have 
discovered.
4 	BUILDING TEAM SKILLS
The cost of promotional methods is an important factor in a pro-
motional campaign. Representatives who sell advertising space 
for magazines, newspapers, radio stations, and television stations 
can quote the price of the medium to the advertiser. The adver-
tiser then can use cost per thousand persons reached (CPM) to 
compare the cost efficiency of advertising in the same medium.
Assignment
1.	 Working in teams of five to seven, choose one of these media: 
local television stations, newspapers, or radio stations. You 
can choose magazines if your library has a copy of Standard 
Rate and Data Service.
2.	 Using the following equation, compare the CPM of advertis-
ing in whatever local medium you chose:
 
3.	 Report your team’s findings to the class.
5 	RESEARCHING DIFFERENT CAREERS
There are many sources available online containing occupational 
and career materials. Search for trade and professional magazines 
and journals about specific occupations and industries that you are 
interested in. Familiarize yourself with the concerns and activities 
of potential employers by skimming their annual reports and other 
publicly distributed materials. Publicly traded companies often 
have a link to this data on their Web sites. Another potentially use-
ful source of information is to visit the Web sites of some of the key 
companies in the industry you are researching. Checking their Web 
sites for current industry news, challenges, and developments can 
provide a good insight into the nature of the industry.
Assignment
1.	 Choose a specific occupation.
2.	 Conduct an Internet search of the occupation.
3.	 Prepare a list of sources where information about the occupa-
tion you selected can be found.

When a 140-year-old company finally redesigns its logo, that’s big 
news. Graeter’s, the beloved Cincinnati-based maker of premium 
ice cream, is still managed by direct descendants of its founders. 
Over the years, the company has added complementary products 
such as baked goods and candy. These days, ice cream accounts 
for more than 85 percent of Graeter’s $30 million in annual 
sales—and the highest profit margins come from selling packaged 
ice cream to supermarkets and grocery stores. 
To support coast-to-coast growth, the company has not only 
changed its logo, it has forged new distribution relationships, 
added new ice-cream flavors, introduced a rewards program, and 
moved into social media. In short, Graeter’s marketing efforts 
take full advantage of 21st century technology, even though some 
of the firm’s recipes date back more than a century and all of the 
ice cream is still made by hand to preserve the quality that made 
the brand famous.
FROM SCOOPS TO SUPERMARKETS 
AND BEYOND 
For most of its long history, Graeter’s concentrated on making ice 
cream and selling it by the scoop in its own shops. Then it began 
distributing packaged ice cream through Kroger’s supermarkets 
in Cincinnati, a relationship that led Graeter’s to new customer 
insights and, ultimately, to lucrative new markets. 
Kroger’s data revealed that out of the tens of thousands 
of brands sold in its stores, premium-priced Graeter’s com-
mands the strongest brand loyalty. Kroger owns the King 
Soopers grocery chain in Denver, and research there showed 
that more Denver ice-cream buyers choose premium brands 
than cheaper choices. To test reaction to Graeter’s, King 
Soopers began carrying 12 of the firm’s best-selling ice-cream 
flavors. Graeter’s expected to sell two or three gallons per 
store per week in Denver. Within a few weeks, however, it was 
selling an average of five gallons per store per week. Next, 
Kroger stores in Texas and Georgia began carrying Graeter’s 
ice cream, and customer reception was so positive that distri-
bution was soon expanded to the entire national network of 
2,400 Kroger-owned stores.
Today, Graeter’s works with Kroger, Whole Foods Market, 
and thousands of grocery retailers across the country,
sometimes selling directly and sometimes through food
brokers. Its ice creams are also on the menu in some fine
restaurants and country clubs. In addition, the company oper-
ates an online store and will ship ice cream overnight to any 
of the 48 continental states (California is its biggest shipping 
market). The management team would like to explore selling 
Graeter’s in Canada, perhaps within the next five years. “The 
challenge, of course, is to preserve the integrity of the product 
as we grow,” says CEO Richard Graeter II. “But we have done 
that for more than 100 years, and I’d argue that it’s better 
now than ever.”
A TASTE OF GRAETER’S
The company’s top-selling flavor is black raspberry chocolate 
chip—at 30 years young, a relatively new edition to the product 
line. It’s always on the menu at company stores, along with other 
popular flavors and an ever-changing group of more than one 
dozen limited-time seasonal and “mystery” flavors. For example, 
Graeter’s used its Facebook page to announce the introduction of 
Cake Batter Fudge Brownie as a recent mystery flavor. Depending 
on how well limited-time flavors sell, some will become a regular 
part of the menu, some reappear during a later season, and some 
will vanish forever. Publicizing these unique flavors helps Graeter’s 
build excitement among current customers and bring new cus-
tomers in for a taste. 
Publicity about Graeter’s rich, creamy products has sparked 
floods of orders from customers who live miles from any store. 
Before Oprah Winfrey told viewers on her talk show that Graeter’s 
was the best ice cream she had ever tasted, the company was fill-
ing about 40 mail orders per day. After Winfrey’s on-air compli-
ment in 2002, “the next day we probably shipped 400,” the CEO 
remembers. Since then, Graeter’s has enjoyed occasional brand 
exposure on the Food Network, the Fine Living Channel, the 
Travel Channel, and even the History Channel. 
Because Graeter’s competes with brands owned by multina-
tional giants, it faces the same challenge in new markets as any 
“small, regional niche player,” says George Denman, vice presi-
dent of sales and marketing. Its marketing is focused on “estab-
lishing a relationship with the consumer, building brand aware-
ness [through] trial and repeat . . . One of the first things we do 
is we demo the product. We get it out in front of the consumer 
and get them to taste it, because the product sells itself.” The 
company has also been reducing its price to distributors, who 
can then promote Graeter’s pints at special sale prices. “If a con-
sumer has maybe been buying Ben & Jerry’s and never considered 
ours, because maybe that dollar price point difference was too 
high, this gives her the opportunity to try us. And once she tries 
us, we know we’ve brand-switched that consumer right then,” 
Denman adds.
“SWEET REWARDS” FOR LOYALTY
Graeter’s created the “Sweet Rewards” program to motivate 
repeat purchasing at its scoop shops, identify its best custom-
ers for special in-store attention, and reinforce customer loy-
alty. Customers simply pick up a Sweet Rewards card in any 
Graeter’s shop, register for the program online, and present the 
card whenever they buy in a Graeter’s store. Members get 10 
bonus points for joining and one point for every $1 they spend. 
They can redeem points for rewards such as a free T-shirt, a free

Graeter’s teddy bear, or a discount on future purchases. Because 
Graeter’s collects purchase data electronically and has the e-mail 
address of every member, it stays in touch with special promo-
tions such as double rewards points for buying featured items. 
Through its Cincinnati-based ad agency, Graeter’s does 
some local advertising, including point-of-sale displays in gro-
cery stores, radio ads, print ads, and billboards. The company 
launches small-scale promotions for new-product introduc-
tions, National Ice Cream Month, and other occasions. The 
head of sales and marketing says, “We are looking at electronic 
couponing, where consumers will be able to go to our Web 
site as a new consumer . . . and secure a dollar-off coupon 
to try Graeter’s, just for coming to our Web site or joining up 
on Facebook. We’ve done loyalty programs with Kroger where 
they have actually direct-mailed loyal consumers and offered . 
. . discounts as well . . . . So far it’s worked well for us. We’ve 
had to go back and look at the return on investment on each of 
these programs and cut some things out and improve on some 
other things, but in the end we have been very pleased with the 
results.”25
Questions
1.	 Which of Graeter’s marketing-mix elements are most likely to 
be affected by external forces in the marketing environment, 
and in what ways? 
2.	 Graeter’s scoop shops sell ice cream, sorbet, smoothies, 
candy, and (in Cincinnati only) bakery items. Should the com-
pany consider a brand extension such as iced coffee drinks for 
its scoop-shop menu? Explain your answer.
3.	 Is Graeter’s using intensive, selective, or exclusive distribution? 
Why is this level of market coverage appropriate for its ice 
cream products?
This part is one of the most important components of your busi-
ness plan. In this part, you will present the facts that you have 
gathered on the size and nature of your market(s). State market 
size in dollars and units. How many units and what is the dollar 
value of the products you expect to sell in a given time period? 
Indicate your primary and secondary sources of data and the 
methods you used to estimate total market size and your market 
share. Part 5 of your textbook covers all marketing-related topics. 
These chapters should help you to answer the questions in this 
part of the business plan.
THE MARKETING PLAN COMPONENT
The marketing plan component is and should be unique to 
your business. Many assumptions or projections used in the 
analysis may turn out differently; therefore, this component 
should be flexible enough to be adjusted as needed. The mar-
keting plan should include answers to at least the following 
questions:
  5.1.  What are your target markets, and what common identifi-
able need(s) can you satisfy?
  5.2.  What are the competitive, legal, political, economic, tech-
nological, and sociocultural factors affecting your market-
ing efforts?
  5.3.  What are the current needs of each target market? Describe 
the target market in terms of demographic, geographic, 
psychographic, and product-usage characteristics. What 
changes in the target market are anticipated?
  5.4.  What advantages and disadvantages do you have in meet-
ing the target market’s needs?
  5.5.  How will your product distribution, promotion, and price 
satisfy customer needs?
  5.6.  How effectively will your products meet these needs?
  5.7.  What are the relevant aspects of consumer behavior and 
product use?
  5.8.  What are your company’s projected sales volume, market 
share, and profitability?
  5.9.  What are your marketing objectives? Include the following 
in your marketing objectives:
●
●
Product introduction, improvement, or innovation
●
●
Sales or market share
●
●
Profitability
●
●
Pricing
●
●
Distribution
●
●
Advertising (Prepare advertising samples for the appendix.)
Make sure that your marketing objectives are clearly writ-
ten, measurable, and consistent with your overall marketing 
strategy.
5.10.  How will the results of your marketing plan be measured 
and evaluated?
REVIEW OF BUSINESS PLAN ACTIVITIES
Remember that even though it will be time-consuming, develop-
ing a clear, well-written marketing plan is important. Therefore, 
make sure that you have checked the plan for any weaknesses 
or problems before proceeding to Part 6. Also, make certain 
that all your answers to the questions in this and other parts are 
consistent throughout the business plan. Finally, write a brief 
statement that summarizes all the information for this part of 
the business plan.

The Big Business of Angry Birds
A game that didn’t exist until 2009 has rocketed its parent company into the big time 
with $100 million in annual revenue and millions of fans worldwide. Rovio Entertainment, 
based in Finland, created Angry Birds as a game application in which players use slingshots 
to send red birds hurtling toward green pigs. The company also started a Facebook page 
to spread the word and, a few months later, a blog to announce its news and connect with 
fans.
Within a year, 50 million people had downloaded Angry Birds to smartphones, iPads, 
and other electronic gadgets, playing either the free version (surrounded by ads) or paying 
to upgrade to premium versions. For less than the price of a latte, many players were happy 
to buy access to the game’s highest levels. Before the game’s third anniversary, the number 
of players had soared to 500 million, earning Rovio a healthy profit and a global fan base 
eager for more games and game-related merchandise.
To make the most of the game’s popularity, Rovio developed a line of shirts and toys 
for sale through its e-business online store. Soon it was selling 1 million stuffed pigs and 
birds plus 1 million branded T-shirts every month through its Web site, along with sea-
sonal items such as Halloween costumes. Then Rovio licensed its brand so that authorized 
products could be marketed through Amazon.com and other online businesses, as well as 
in traditional stores. Several times a year, Rovio released new Angry Birds games, some 
geared to seasonal events (such as the Chinese New Year) and some taking the birds-
versus-pigs rivalry to new heights (outer space). Social media helped fuel the frenzy as 
players compared notes online about their triumphs and frustrations with the latest game 
variations.
Now, with nearly 1 billion downloads, Angry Birds has transformed the way Rovio 
makes money, allowing it to move beyond games into other goods and services. “We only 
care about two things, our fans and our brand,” says the chief marketing officer, who views 
Angry Birds as an entertainment brand for movies, theme parks, and clothing, just like the 
Disney animated movie characters.1
F
or Rovio Entertainment, the company profiled in the Inside Business feature for 
this chapter, Angry Birds is big business! With nearly 1 billion downloads and 
$100 million in annual revenue from global sales of stuffed animals, T-shirts, 
and other game-related merchandise, Angry Birds and its parent company Rovio 
Entertainment provide a good example of how fast social media and e-business have 
developed and the degree to which they are changing the way people live their lives. 
Take a moment to think about how social media and technology affect your own life. 
In just a few short years, it has changed the way we communicate with each other, 
it has changed the way we meet people, and it has changed the way we shop. In this 
chapter, we explore how these trends affect both individuals and businesses.
We begin this chapter by examining why social media is important for both indi-
viduals and business firms. Next, we discuss how companies can use social media to 
build relationships with customers, the goals for social media usage, and the steps 
required to build a social media plan and measure the effectiveness of a firm’s social 
media activities. In the last part of this chapter, we take a close look at how firms use 
technology to conduct business on the Internet and what growth opportunities and 
challenges affect both social media and e-businesses.
FYI
Did You Know?
Rovio Entertainment, the parent 
company of Angry Birds, rings 
up more than $100 million every 
year from global sales of game-
related goods and services.

Part 6   Social Media, e-Business, and Accounting
 Why Is Social Media Important?
If you are a “digital native” (anyone under the age of 32), you know exactly what 
social media is because you have grown up with technology and are very comfortable 
sharing information about yourself. If you are anyone else, social media seems like a 
strange (but exciting) phenomenon where millions of people freely share, create, vote, 
and connect with other people effortlessly using Internet-based technologies.
What Is Social Media and How Popular Is It?
Today, there are many definitions of social media because it is still developing 
and continually changing. For our purposes, social media represents the online 
interactions that allow people and businesses to communicate and share ideas, 
personal information, and information about products and services. Simply put: Social 
media is about people. It is about a culture of participation, meaning that people can 
now discuss, vote, create, connect, and advocate much easier than ever before. For

for a business to use social

example, you can post your plans for a weekend trip on Facebook. 
Then you can share a travel itinerary and chronicle your trip through 
videos, photos, and ratings on Facebook. People can also use Twitter 
to raise awareness about bone-marrow donations in order to help a 
friend find a match. While it’s hard to imagine, many popular social 
media sites like Facebook and Twitter were just created in the past 
decade (see Figure 16.1).
So how popular is social media? A recent Pew Internet Research 
study showed that more than two-thirds of online adults use some sort 
of social media platform like Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter. Most 
of them say staying in touch with family and friends is their primary 
reason for using social media and roughly half say that reconnecting 
with old friends is a major reason why they use social media. Other 
reasons like connecting with people who share interests, making new 
friends, and reading comments by public figures are less important.2
Why Businesses Use Social Media
Social media has completely changed the business environment. 
Early on, companies saw potential in the sheer number of people 
using social media and that made using social media a top priority 
for many business firms. By using social media, companies could share information 
about their products and services and improve customer service. To date (and by 
the time you read this, the number will be higher), Facebook has not only one 
of the largest social networks with more than 850 million users, but also one 
of the “stickiest” Web sites, meaning that a lot of people spend a lot of time on 
Facebook.3 As a result, many companies have flocked to build Facebook pages, 
develop contests, create Facebook ads, and find ways to get as many people as 
possible to “like” them on Facebook. Coca-Cola, for example, is one of the most 
effective marketers using Facebook, with more than 41 million likes to date.4 For 
more information about why businesses use social media (and the benefits for a 
business), see Figure 16.2.
The fact that so many people are actively sharing information about themselves 
and their likes and dislikes online for all to see was a driving force behind many 
companies’ attempts to develop a social media presence. Unlike social media, tra-
ditional marketing messages were top down—meaning that companies used televi-
sion and magazine ads to promote their product to a large audience without any 
opportunity for feedback. Discussions about products were limited to consumers’

changed the way people communicate and share 
ideas, personal information, and information about 
products and services.  In this photo, mom, dad,

or reading movie reviews or sending an email to 
grandma—all social media activities.

social content sites  allow 
companies to create and share

blog  a Web site that allows a 
company to share information 
in order to not only increase the 
customer’s knowledge about its 
products and services, but also to 
build trust 
immediate circle of friends and family. With social 
media, this is no longer the case. If a person has a 
bad experience with a product or service, they tend 
to post it on their blog or on Facebook, or tweet 
about it. A few years ago, Dell, Inc., experienced the 
wrath of a customer when blogger Jeff Jarvis posted 
a series of rants called “Dell Hell” after purchasing a 
Dell laptop. The post caught the attention of others 
who experienced similar problems; these consumers 
then proceeded to voice their own Dell Hell stories. As 
a result, more people knew about the company’s mistakes 
than ever before. Jarvis continued to voice his experience 
with Dell’s customer service department, which at the time 
was not very effective or responsive. After the story hit the 
mainstream press and their customer service ratings began to 
suffer, Dell finally developed a corporate initiative aimed at 
listening to customers and fixing its customer service prob-
lems.5 Now Dell is considered a leader in monitoring social 
media and listening to customers. The bottom line: Because 
of social media, companies no longer have much control 
over what is said about their products or services, and many 
are not yet comfortable with the new roles set forth by a 
consumer-dominated culture.
Social Media Tools for Business Use
For a business, part of what makes social media so challenging is the sheer number 
of ways to interact with other businesses and both existing and potential consumers. 
Companies are using social media because it allows the company to
●
●connect with customers;
●
●listen to its main stakeholders (including but not limited to customers);
●
●provide another means of customer service;
●
●develop content that is valuable to customers; and
●
●engage customers in product development and formulation.
Social content sites allow companies to create and share information about their 
products and services via blogs, videos, photos, and podcasts. For businesses selling 
to other businesses, social content sites can also include webinars and online informa-
tional promotional materials. For an overview of how businesses can use social media 
tools, take another look at Figure 16.2. 
Business Use of Blogs
For businesses, blogs have become one of the most widely used tools for the effective use 
of social media. A blog is a Web site that allows a company to share information in order 
to increase customers’ knowledge about its products and services, as well as to build 
trust. Once a story or information is posted, customers can provide feedback through 
comments, which is one of the most important ways of creating a conversation between 
business firms and consumers. Some experts believe that every company should have a 
blog that speaks to current and potential customers, not as customers, but as people.6
Blogs are effective at developing better relationships with customers, attracting 
new customers, telling stories about the company’s products or services, and providing 
an active forum for testing new ideas. For example, Southwest Airlines’ Nuts about 
Southwest blog (www.blogsouthwest.com) provides information about the ­company 
and allows customers to interact with company employees. By including information

Although marketing may not be the first thing that comes 
to mind when you use social media, lots of companies want 
you to “like” them and spread the word about their products 
or services. Keep your eyes open for companies on social 
networking sites, and you just might grab a special deal.

businesses that are selling to other businesses.
Photos, Videos, and Podcasts
In addition to blogs, another tool for social content is media sharing 
sites, which allow users to upload multimedia content including photos, 
videos, and podcasts. Before participating in media sharing, consider the 
following three factors.
●
●Who will create the photos, videos, and podcasts that will be used?
●
●How will the content be distributed to interested businesses and 
consumers?
●
●How much will it cost to create and distribute the material?
Today, photo sharing provides a method for companies to tell a com-
pelling story about its products or services through postings on either the 
company’s Web site or a social media site.
Videos have also gained popularity because of their inherent ability to 
tell stories. Entertainment companies, for example, now traditionally use 
YouTube as a way to showcase movie trailers. And Home Depot has also 
posted great do-it-yourself videos on its YouTube channel. Companies know 
that YouTube, Flickr, and others sites are useful because they are already 
recognized by other businesses and consumers as a source of both enter-
tainment and information. YouTube is the largest video site and one of the 
largest general sites in the United States. YouTube is not only large (in terms of visitors), 
but the characteristics of its users are evenly split among different age groups and sexes.
Podcasts are digital audio or video files that people listen to or watch online on 
tablets, computers, MP3 players, or smartphones. Think of podcasts as radio shows 
that are distributed through various means (like iTunes) and not linked to a scheduled 
time period. The great thing about podcasts is that they are available for download 
at any time. Both National Public Radio (NPR) and the New York Times have used 
podcasts to share news and information.
Social Media Ratings
Social media enables shoppers to access opinions, recommendations, and referrals 
from others within and outside of their own social circles. This type of information 
is available via a social media site and can include reviews and ratings, as well as 
information on sales promotions programs like Groupon and LivingSocial. Both of 
these sites provide information about companies that offer deep discounts to customers 
that redeem an offer. 
Sites for ratings and reviews are based on the idea that consumers trust the opin-
ions of others when it comes to purchasing products and services. According to Nielsen 
Media Research, more than 70 percent of consumers said that they trust online con-
sumer opinions.7 This statistic was much higher when compared with the same type of 
research for traditional advertising. Based on the early work of Amazon and eBay, new 
sites have sprung up allowing consumers to rate local businesses or compare products 
and services. One of the most popular, Yelp, combines customer ratings with social 
networking and is now the largest local review directory on the Web.
Social Games
Social games are another area of growth in social media. A social game is “a multiplayer, 
competitive, goal-oriented activity with defined rules of engagement and online connectivity 
among a community of players.”8 One of the most important aspects of social media 
is entertainment and games like Angry Birds and FarmVille serve that purpose. Indeed, 
research shows that the “gamification” of social media is a huge trend because people like 
the competition, social status, and rewards that they can earn through social gaming.9 For 
businesses that create games, it can be very profitable. As mentioned in the Inside Business

Podcasts can be not only informative, but 
also inspirational. As the wife of a retired 
army sergeant and an army veteran herself, 
Victoria Parham knows what it is like to 
experience long separations, job instability, and 
single parenthood that come with the military 
lifestyle. Today she shares her experiences and 
solutions to everyday problems in a free twice-
monthly podcast created to inspire, educate, and 
entertain military spouses.

While some businesses elect to create their own games, others choose to place advertising 
into a game. For example, the search engine Bing placed ads within the Facebook game 
FarmVille and gained several hundred thousand Facebook fans as a result.10
Achieving Business Objectives Through 
Social Media
Although the popularity of social media is a recent phenomenon, many businesses are 
already using it to achieve important objectives. Some of these goals are long-term—such 
as building brand awareness and brand reputation—while others are more short-term—
such as increasing Web site traffic or generating sales leads.  Regardless of how social 
media is used, there are a lot of business opportunities. In this section, we explore a few 
ways that companies have used social media effectively to achieve business objectives.
Social Media Communities
For a business, social media can be used to build a community. Social media 
communities are social networks based on the relationships among people.11 These 
electronic communities encourage two-way communication, allow for people to develop 
profiles, and identify other people to connect with by using technology and the Internet. 
People in each community can be called friends, fans, followers, or connections. Popular 
social networking sites include Facebook (the largest), LinkedIn (for professionals), 
Twitter, Google+, YouTube, Pinterest, and many others. To see how many businesses use 
the top four social media community sites, see Figure 16.3.
There are social communities for every interest, ethnic group, and lifestyle. Different 
types of social communities include forums and wikis. Forums were perhaps the earliest 
form of social community. A forum is an interactive version of a community bulletin board 
that focuses on threaded discussions. These are particularly popular with people who share a 
common interest such as video games. Another community based on social media is a wiki. 
A wiki is a collaborative online working space that enables members to contribute content 
that is then sharable with other people. With wikis, members of the community are the edi-
tors and gatekeepers ensuring that the content is correct and updated. Wikipedia—the free 
online encyclopedia—is the best example of a wiki. A community of unpaid experts volun-
tarily keeps the content on the Wikipedia Web site as updated and accurate as possible.
The whole purpose of social networks is to build communities and develop connec-
tions. Today, many companies are using social media to build communities with other busi-
nesses and consumers in order to achieve business objectives. Recently, Pepsi used social 
media to showcase its commitment to real-world communities by shifting the $20 million 
typically spent on Super Bowl advertising to a Web site that allowed customers to post

ideas for helping their own communities in areas like education and the 
environment. The driving force behind its “Refresh Everything” campaign 
was the belief that the company needed to “walk the walk” and really do 
something to make an impact. The Pepsi Refresh Project allowed people 
to upload their ideas or vote for their favorites. Pepsi then funded projects 
with the most votes. More than 57 million customers voted on differ-
ent ideas—all designed to improve communities. For Pepsi, this social 
media project enabled the soft-drink giant to engage its customers who 
are heavy social media users.12
Crisis and Reputation Management
One of the most important reasons for listening to stakeholders is to 
determine whether there is a crisis brewing. A majority of companies 
believe that their company is less than a year away from some 
potential crisis moment and monitor social media for conversations 
that may predict a crisis.13 Recently, the organization Susan G. Komen 
for the Cure decided to withdraw its funding for Planned Parenthood. 
Immediately, Planned Parenthood sent out an e-mail to its donors in an 
effort to replace the lost funding. As the news traveled from e-mail to 
social media, many people expressed their outrage that Komen for the 
Cure was playing a “political card.” According to social media experts, 
the response from the Komen organization to negative publicity was 
inadequate. The Komen organization failed to address the issue on Facebook or Twitter 
even after mainstream media began reporting its controversial decision. It was not until 
the next day when Nancy Brinker, founder of Susan G. Komen for the Cure, talked 
about the issue, but by then the organization’s public image had already been tarnished.
United Airlines also found out the hard way what happens when customers com-
plain to social networks. Guitarist Dave Carroll accused United Airlines of breaking 
his guitar during baggage handling in Chicago. After months of moving through the 
traditional channels and getting nowhere, Dave wrote a song, filmed a video, and 
posted it on YouTube. He also had friends send out the link to their networks. Soon 
the video had thousands of views and people started sharing their own negative United 
Airlines stories. United did try to control the damage on Twitter, but most people saw 
it as an empty promise to improve customer service. Soon the company was embroiled 
in bad press (in social media as well as mainstream media), which eventually caused 
their stock price to fall 10 percent. In the end, it is estimated that neglecting to attend 
to customer needs cost United Airlines about $180 million.14
Listening to Stakeholders
Listening to people, whether they are customers or not, is always an important 
aspect of a company’s social media plan. Indeed, listening is often the first step 
when developing a social media strategy. Listening to the conversations unfolding on 
Facebook or Twitter, for example, can be important to understanding just what people 
think about a company’s products and services. By monitoring Facebook, Twitter, and 
other social media sites, Domino’s Pizza found out that people were not very happy 
with its product quality. Customers described the sauce as “tasting like ketchup” and 
the crust as “tasting like cardboard.” Unfortunately, there were enough comments of 
a similar nature for the company to use traditional marketing research to verify this 
information. They found the sentiment to be true and the company then developed a 
plan to reinvent every aspect of the company—and its pizza products. Did the plan 
work? Same store sales increased more than 14 percent.15
Targeting Customers
Many companies are using social media to increase awareness and build their brand 
among customers. It is especially valuable in targeting the Millennials. Millennials 
are tech-savvy digital natives born after 1980. When Ford wanted to introduce its

Social media:  A new way to handle a crisis. 
For years, Walmart—the world’s largest retailer—has 
tried to repair a reputation that’s been damaged 
by decades of criticism and legal problems.  Now 
Walmart has a new public relations tool—social 
media—to not only monitor what people are saying 
about the company, but also to tell its side of the 
story when controversies develop.

subcompact car, the Fiesta, to Millennials, it used social media. Ford chose to target 
Millennials because, as a group, they are also more likely than older consumers to 
purchase a subcompact car. For this social media promotion, Ford recruited 100 social 
media users, dubbed “agents,” who were given a Ford Fiesta to drive for six months. 
The only requirement was that each agent talked about the car on social media—using 
video, posts on Facebook and Twitter, and other social media sites. Initially, Ford set 
a goal of attracting 144,000 Web site visitors, but by the end of the promotion more 
than 300,000 people had viewed the Web site. Additional results showed that Ford’s 
social media marketing promotion for the Fiesta worked well and social media could 
be used to build brand recognition with a specific group of people.16
In some cases, awareness is not a problem, but the ability to connect with the cus-
tomer is. Social media can be used to build that connection. Consider the case of Old 
Spice. Once thought of as an “old man’s” cologne, Old Spice struggled to gain attention 
for its body wash product in an industry dominated by newcomers like Axe—a brand 
that had done a very good job of connecting with Millennial men. Old Spice decided 
to use social media to reposition its body wash with a video launched on YouTube. 
The video was launched online during the Super Bowl, and then on network television 
later. The results were so positive that Old Spice followed up with a campaign using 
online videos based on comments from customers posted on Twitter and Facebook.17
Social Media Marketing
According to a survey by eMarketer, 80 percent of U.S. companies with more than 
100 employees are using social media tools for marketing. Among small business, 
the rate of social media use for marketing is closer to 40 percent, and among 
businesses selling to other businesses, the rate is around 24 percent.18 Social media 
marketing is the “utilization of social media technologies, channels, and software 
to create, communicate, deliver and exchange offerings that have value for an 
organization.”19 As companies become more comfortable with social media, we can 
expect even more companies to use social media to market products and services 
to their customers. Already, research indicates that companies are shifting their 
advertising money from traditional marketing (like television and magazines) to 
digital marketing (like Internet search engines and social media). Experts now predict 
that social media will account for 26 percent of all online spending by 2016.20 The 
primary reason is simple. People are spending more time online.21 Often the first 
step for a business that wants to use social media is to go to LinkedIn, Facebook, 
or Twitter. As you can tell from the information in Figure  16.4, companies like 
LinkedIn make using their technology as easy as possible to connect with potential 
or existing customers.
Today, many companies have been quite successful using social media marketing 
not only to develop customer awareness, but also to obtain sales leads and increase 
actual sales. HubSpot, for example, is a software company that helps small and 
medium-sized companies develop inbound marketing programs. Inbound market-
ing is a marketing term that describes new ways of gaining attention, and ultimately, 
customers, by creating content on a Web site that pulls customers in. Tools used for 
inbound marketing programs include search engine optimization, blogging, videos, and 
social media. In order to market its software products, the software company HubSpot 
shunned traditional advertising and began to practice what it preached. First, the com-
pany developed its own inbound marketing program by creating valuable content 
and marketing information that was then distributed through social media and search 
engine Web sites. Companies interested in HubSpot’s software were required to enter 
contact information (name, phone number, and e-mail address) in order to view the 
information. People provided contact information because they believed the company’s 
software could help them improve their marketing activities. As a result of HubSpot’s 
inbound marketing program, the cost of generating new sales leads was five to seven 
times less than leads generated by more traditional marketing activities and as a bonus 
they gained thousands of new customers.22

Dell also uses social media to sell its computer and technology products. Unlike 
other companies experimenting with social media, Dell decided to be more visible 
and actively use social media to increase sales by using Twitter. The company has sold 
computers valued at more than $6.5 million by including links in its Twitter account 
to the DellOutlet Web site. While this represents a tiny percentage of total sales, it does 
show that products can be sold through social media.23
As important as social media is, it is only one aspect of digital marketing. Indeed, 
digital marketing or online marketing is comprised of several areas, 
including
●
●online public relations—developing social media press kits;
●
●search engine optimization—using keywords in the Web site 
in order to rank higher in search engine results;
●
●search engine marketing—buying ads like Google’s AdWords 
to increase traffic to a company’s Web site;
●
●display advertising—buying banner ads;
●
●e-mail marketing—targeting customers through opt-in email 
campaigns; and
●
●content marketing—developing photos, videos, podcasts, blog 
posts, and other tools to increase the value to the customer.
Generating New Product Ideas
Companies can use social media to conduct much of their 
consumer-based research. Using insight gained from Facebook 
or Twitter, for example, allows a company to modify existing 
products and services and develop new ones. Crowdsourcing 
involves outsourcing tasks to a group of people in order to tap 
into the ideas of the crowd. In some cases valuable information 
can be obtained by crowd voting. Frito Lay, for example, has 
used crowd voting for the last few years when they allowed 
The face of social media.  While many people use 
Facebook to connect with friends and relatives, the 
world’s largest social media site is so much more!  For 
many businesses, Facebook has created new ways to 
market their products and services and connect with 
potential or existing customers.  Experts predict that the 
use of social media sites like Facebook will only increase in 
the future because people are spending more time online.

people to create and then vote for their favorite television spots for its popular Doritos 
brand. The winners are then featured during the Super Bowl. Their effort “Crash the 
Super Bowl” has been wildly successful.24
Companies can even build communities for specific brands in order to obtain 
information and new ideas from consumers. A few years ago, Starbucks built a net-
work called Mystarbucksidea.com that allowed customers to post ideas about how 
the company could improve. Since the creation of the Web site, thousands of ideas 
have been posted about Starbucks products, the customer’s store experience, and the 
company’s community involvement. The site also enables people to 
vote on the best ideas, many of which Starbucks has already imple-
mented. For example, getting a free coffee on your birthday if you 
are a Gold Member or developing a VIP program were both origi-
nally customer ideas. In cases such as this one, customers appreciate 
the ability to share their ideas with a company to whom they are 
loyal, only to receive reciprocal loyalty when the company imple-
ments their ideas.25
Recruiting Employees
For years, companies have used current employees to recruit 
new employees based on the theory that “birds of a feather flock 
together.” The concept is simple: Current employees’ friends and 
family may prove to be good job candidates. Social media takes that 
concept to a whole new level. LinkedIn, the largest social network 
for professionals, has been used quite effectively by both large and 
small companies to recruit employees. Indeed, more than half of 
Fortune 100 companies use LinkedIn to recruit future employees. 
Using LinkedIn is beneficial for companies because it saves time and 
lowers recruiting costs. And using a site like LinkedIn also allows 
employers to see more information about candidates. Companies 
like Accenture, Home Depot, IBM, and Oracle have all had success 
with LinkedIn.
How do companies find the right employee?  
Answer:  More and more companies are using social 
media sites to recruit employees.  Sites like LinkedIn, 
the largest social network for professionals, are often 
used by both large and small companies to advertise 
current job openings and reach out to potential 
employees located not only in the United States, but 
also in other parts of the world.

an e-mail address that matches the image you want to project.

Don’t: Post inappropriate material. One recruiter says he and his 
colleagues don’t judge applicants based on their personal 
posts, but “we will judge their judgment for putting it on 
the Internet” if text or photos are offensive or racy. The 
head of a marketing research agency warns about using a 
lot of profanity online. An executive at the Hill Holliday ad 
agency doesn’t like to “see a lot of posts about nothing or 
points of view that are judgmental or not open-minded. 
Inappropriate pictures can also [make] a bad impression.”

Don’t: Post too often. Although many employers welcome 
active users of social media, they steer clear of applicants 
who post too often. “Too many Twitter posts from 9 to 5 
might make us wonder how you find time for your real job,” 
says the CEO of Zipcar.

Developing a Social Media Plan
Before developing a plan to use social media, it is important to determine how social 
media can improve the organization’s overall performance and how it “fits” with a 
company’s other operational and promotional activities. For example, if a social media 
plan attempts to improve customer service, it needs to link to the company’s overall 
organizational efforts to improve customer service.
Steps to Build a Social Media Plan
Once it is determined how social media links to the company’s other activities, there 
are several steps that should be considered.
Step 1: Listen to Determine Opportunities  Often social media is used to “listen” 
to what customers like and don’t like about a company’s products or services.  For exam-
ple, reading comments on social media sites can yield some insight into how consumers 
are reacting to a price increase or decrease for an existing product or service. Monitoring 
social media sites also allows managers and employees to enter the conversation and tell 
the company’s side of the story. In addition, companies can monitor social media sites to 
gather information about competitors as well as what is being said about the industry.
After the listening phase, it is important to analyze the information to identify the 
company’s strengths and weaknesses. For a company, it is also important to identify 
opportunities and threats before taking the next step—setting objectives.
Step 2: Establish Social Media Objectives  After listening to and analyzing the 
information obtained from social media sites, it is important to use that information 
to develop specific objectives. For social media, an objective is a specific statement 
about what a social media plan should accomplish. Each objective should be specific, 
measurable, achievable, realistic, and oriented toward the future.
For most companies, the most popular objectives are increasing brand awareness, 
acquiring new customers, introducing new products, retaining current customers, and 
gaining customer insight.26 Other objectives that are often important include improv-
ing search engine ranking, showcasing public relations activities, increasing Web site 
traffic, and generating sales leads.27 All objectives need to be clear and linked to specific 
actions that can be used to accomplish each objective.
Step 3: Segment and Target the Social Customer  Ideally, a company will have 
developed a customer profile that describes a typical customer in terms of age, income, 
gender, ethnicity, etc. When segmenting or targeting customers, it also helps to know 
how they think, how they spend their time, how much they buy, and how often they 
buy. In fact, more information about potential customers will help you develop a social 
media plan to achieve a company’s objectives. Lack of information about customers 
can lead to wasted time and money and the inability to successfully achieve the firm’s 
social media objectives. For example, most companies feel that they must use Facebook 
and Twitter. But if their core customer does not use these social media sites, then it 
does not make sense to use them. Additionally it is important to really understand how 
customers use social media.
●
●Do they create content like photos, videos, blog posts, etc?
●
●Do they use social media for ratings and reviews?
●
●Do they post product reviews and ratings on Facebook accounts?
●
●Do they spend a lot of time using social media?
According to Forrester Research, there are six types of individuals that use social 
media. Individuals can be classified as creators, critics, collectors, joiners, spectators, or 
inactives. In addition to the Forrester classifications of social media users, additional 
information that can help you target just the “right” social media customer is illus-
trated in Figure 16.5.

Part 6   Social Media, e-Business, and Accounting
Step 4: Select Social Media Tools  The search for the right social media tool(s) 
usually begins with the company’s objectives, outlined in Step 2. It also helps to review 
the target customer or segment of the market the company is trying to reach (Step 3). 
With this information, the next step is to choose the right social media tools to reach 
the right customers. A company can use social communities, blogs, photos, videos, 
podcasts, or games to reach potential or existing customers. For example, if the goal is 
to recruit college students for college entry-level jobs, LinkedIn may be a good choice. 
Remember, it is not necessary (or even advisable) to use all of the above tools. It also 
helps to remember that social media is not free and can be quite expensive because it 
costs both time and money.
Step 5: Implement and Integrate the Plan  Once social media tools have been 
identified, a company can implement and integrate the social media plan. Because a 
social media plan doesn’t necessarily have a start and stop date, it is different from 
traditional advertising campaigns. Some social media activities continue and have a 
life of their own. For example, Zappos, a very successful and well-respected online 
retailer, is a company who is always “on” in terms of its social media. Indeed, they do 
very little traditional advertising and instead rely on social media to promote products, 
monitor customer service, and enhance the company’s reputation. Some companies, on 
the other hand, feel that it is important to have a mix of short-  and long-term social 
media promotion. In this case, it is important to develop each social media activity to 
make sure that it is as effective as it can be. For example, if a company is running a 
Facebook promotion, it is important to consider issues like developing a branded page, 
updating the page frequently, and providing fresh content to keep customers coming 
back to the Facebook site. If the same or similar social media activity is used on Twitter, 
the company must make changes to make sure it works on the Twitter site.
To increase the effectiveness of social media, companies will often integrate online 
promotions with more traditional or offline promotions. For example, it is not unusual 
The more information you have about social media customers, the easier it is to 
develop a social media plan that targets the “right” customer.

service is provided on Twitter. Indeed, as companies increase the 
amount of money spent on digital marketing and social media, they 
will attempt to tie online and offline promotions together in order 
to get “more bang for the buck.”
Measuring and Adapting a Social Media Plan
Because social media is a relatively new method of reaching 
customers, many companies struggle when attempting to measure 
social media. Often companies use the same measurements that 
have been used with long-established media channels like television 
and radio to determine the effect of social media on the customer’s 
awareness of the company or a specific brand and if sales (and profits) 
are increasing. Based on this information, the company may try to 
determine if it is getting a positive return on its investment in social 
media. Generally, there are two types of social media measurement. 
While both quantitative and qualitative measurements can be used, 
most companies tend to use quantitative measurements.
Quantitative Social Media Measurement  Quantitative social 
media measurement consists of using numerical measurements, such 
as counting the number of Web site visitors, number of fans and followers, number of leads 
generated, and the number of new customers. For example, Coke has 41 million likes on 
its Facebook page and Dell Computer increases sales revenue by more than $6.5 million by 
using Twitter. Table 16.1 shows a few popular quantitative ways to measure social media.
Because a company must invest both time and money when it uses social media, it 
is important to measure the success and make adjustments if needed. In addition to the 
quantitative measurements already mentioned, a number of companies are using key per-
formance indicators. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are measurements that define 
and measure the progress of an organization toward achieving its objectives. Generally, 
KPIs are quantitative (based on numbers like the number of Twitter followers).
Technology that satisfies needs online. Both large 
and small businesses are using social media to sell 
products and services to customers 24 hours a day 
and seven days a week. As an added bonus, today’s 
technology can reach potential and existing customers 
any place in the world as long as customers have access 
to the Internet.

If measuring the success or failure of social media activities with KPIs, the first step 
is to connect KPIs with objectives. The second step is to set a benchmark—a number 
that shows what success should look like. For example, Ford said that if 144,000 
people visited the Ford Fiesta Web site within a specified time, it would indicate that 
the company’s social media plan to introduce the new subcompact car to Millennials 
was successful. When measured, more than 300,000 people had visited the Web site. 
Simply put: The company’s social media plan was successful because it surpassed the 
original benchmark. It is also possible to compare the company’s social media KPIs 
to its benchmarks over time. When trend comparison is used to measure the effective-
ness of social media, the trend may be more important than the actual percentage of 
increase or decrease for just one measurement period.
Qualitative Social Media Measurement  Qualitative social media measure-
ment is the process of accessing the opinions and beliefs about a brand. This process 
primarily uses sentiment analysis to categorize what is being said about a company. 
Sentiment analysis is a measurement that uses technology to detect the mood, atti-
tudes, or emotions of people who experience a social media activity. Other measure-
ments for determining customer sentiment include:
●
●Customer satisfaction score—defined as the relative satisfaction of customers.
●
●Issue resolution rate—the percentage of customer service inquiries resolved satis-
factorily using social media.
●
●Resolution time—defined as the amount of time taken to resolve customer service 
issues.
When compared to quantitative measurement, it should be noted that many of these 
qualitative social media measurements are more subjective in nature. 
Regardless of the type of measurement used, one of the most powerful aspects of 
social media—and indeed digital marketing—is the ability to tie the objectives of a social 
media plan to the results that were achieved. After reviewing results for social media 
activities against pre-established benchmarks and analyzing trends, changes can be made 
to increase the effectiveness of social media activities. 
Social media is particularly important to businesses that use e-business to sell their 
products and services online. In the next section, we take a close look at how e-business 
firms are organized, satisfy needs online, and earn profits.
Defining e-Business
In Chapter 1, we defined business as the organized effort of individuals to produce 
and sell, for a profit, the products and services that satisfy society’s needs. In a simple 
sense, then, e-business, or electronic business, can be defined as the organized effort 
of individuals to produce and sell, for a profit, the products and services that satisfy 
society’s needs through the facilities available on the Internet. Sometimes people use 
the term e-commerce instead of e-business. In a strict sense, e-business is used when 
you’re talking about all business activities and practices conducted on the Internet by an 
individual firm or industry. On the other hand, e-commerce is a part of e-business and 
usually refers only to buying and selling activities conducted online. In this chapter, we 
generally use the term e-business because of its broader definition and scope. As you will 
see in the remainder of this chapter, e-business is transforming key business activities.
Organizing e-Business Resources
As noted in Chapter 1, to be organized, a business must combine human, material, 
informational, and financial resources. This is true of e-business, too (see Figure 16.6), 
but in this case, the resources may be more specialized than in a typical business. For 
example, people who can design, create, and maintain Web sites are only a fraction 
of the specialized human resources required by e-businesses. Material resources must 
include specialized computers, sophisticated equipment and software, and high-speed

Internet connections. Computer programs that track the number of customers 
who view a firm’s Web site are generally among the specialized informational 
resources required. Financial resources, the money required to start and maintain 
the firm and allow it to grow, usually reflect greater participation by individual 
entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and investors willing to invest in a high-tech 
firm instead of conventional financial sources such as banks.
In an effort to reduce the cost of specialized resources that are used in 
e-business, many firms have turned to outsourcing. Outsourcing is the process 
of finding outside vendors and suppliers that provide professional help, parts, 
or materials at a lower cost. For example, a firm that needs specialized software 
to complete a project may turn to an outside firm located in another part of the 
United States, India, or an Eastern European country.
Satisfying Needs Online
Think for a moment about this question: “Why do people use the Internet?” 
As pointed out in the first part of this chapter, more and more people are using 
computers, the Internet, and social media as a way to connect with people. The 
Internet can also be used to purchase products or services. Today, more people 
use the Internet to satisfy these needs than ever before. Let’s start with two basic 
assumptions.
●
●The Internet has created some new customer needs that did not exist before 
the creation of the Internet.
●
●e-Businesses can satisfy those needs, as well as more traditional ones.
Restoration Hardware (www.restorationhardware.com), for instance, 
gives customers anywhere in the world access to the same virtual store of hard-
ware and decorative items. And at eBay’s global auction site (www.ebay.com), 
customers can, for a small fee, buy and sell almost anything. In each of these 
examples, customers can use the Internet to purchase a product or service.
In addition to purchasing products, the Internet can be used by both indi-
viduals and business firms to obtain information. For example:
●
●Internet users can access newspapers, magazines, and radio and television 
programming at a time and place convenient to them.
●
●The Internet provides the opportunity for two-way interaction between an 
Internet firm and the viewer. For example, the CNN news site (www.cnn.com)
While all businesses use four resources (human, material, informational,  
and financial), these resources are typically more specialized when used  
in an e-business.

Google—the number 1 search engine. 
When Google created its now-famous 
Web site, the developers chose a rather 
simple opening screen with just the 
Google name, a search box, and very 
little else. Users loved the simple format 
and used the search engine to find 
information about products and services, 
investment research, new movies, the 
current weather, and the latest news 
stories. Now Google has used its early 
success to develop new services, including 
Google Earth, Google+, and mobile apps.

●
●Customers can respond to information on the 
Internet by requesting more information or posing 
specific questions, which may lead to purchasing a 
product or service.
●
●Finally, the Internet allows customers to choose the 
content they are offered. Knowing the interests of 
a customer allows an Internet firm to direct appro-
priate, smart advertising to a specific customer. For 
the advertiser, knowing that its advertisements are 
being directed to the most likely customers repre-
sents a better way to spend advertising dollars.
Creating e-Business Profit
Business firms can increase profits either by increasing 
sales revenue or by reducing expenses through a variety of 
e-business activities. 
Increasing Sales Revenue  Each source of sales reve-
nue flowing into a firm is referred to as a revenue stream. 
One way to increase revenues is to sell merchandise on the 
Internet. Online merchants can reach a global customer 
base 24 hours a day, seven days a week, because the oppor-
tunity to shop on the Internet is virtually unrestricted. 
However, shifting revenues earned from customers inside 
a real store to revenues earned from these same customers online does not create any 
real new revenue for a firm. The goal is to find new customers and generate new sales 
so that total revenues are increased.
Intelligent information systems also can help to generate sales revenue for Internet 
firms such as Amazon.com (www.amazon.com). Such systems store information about 
each customer’s purchases, along with a variety of other information about the buyer’s 
preferences. Using this information, the system can assist the customer the next time he 
or she visits the Web site. For example, if the customer has bought a Carrie Underwood 
CD in the past, the system might suggest CDs by similar artists who have either appeared 
on American Idol or won Country Music Awards.
Although some customers may not make a purchase online, the existence of the 
firm’s Web site and the services and information it provides may lead to increased sales 
in the firm’s physical stores. For example, Honda’s Web site (www.
honda.com) can provide basic comparative information for shop-
pers so that they are better prepared for their visit to an automobile 
showroom.
In addition to selling products or services online, e-business rev-
enue streams are created by advertising placed on Web pages and by 
subscription fees charged for access to online services and content. For 
example, Hoover’s (www.hoovers.com), a comprehensive source for 
company and industry information, makes some of its online content 
free for anyone who visits the site, but more detailed information is 
available only by paid subscription. In addition, Hoover’s receives rev-
enue from companies acting as sponsors who advertise their products 
and services on the site.
Many Internet firms that distribute news, magazine and newspa-
per articles, and similar content generate revenue from commissions 
earned from sellers of products linked to the site. Online shopping 
malls, for example, now provide groups of related vendors of elec-
tronic equipment and computer hardware and software with a new 
method of selling their products and services. In many cases, the ven-
dors share online sales revenues with the site owners.

Using Facebook to reach online customers.

using Facebook and other social network sites 
to reach consumers. It’s just one more way to 
provide information to consumers that may want to 
purchase the firm’s products or services.

These days, you can find e-businesses that sell almost 
anything. Many will help you recognize a new need by 
offering free trials of apps, games, or other digital products. 
This is a great way to find out whether the digital product 
is useful, convenient, and worth buying.

and methods of doing business to 
generate sales revenues and reduce 
expenses
Reducing Expenses  Reducing expenses is the second major way in which e-business 
can help to increase profitability. Providing online access to information that customers 
want can reduce the cost of dealing with customers. Sprint Nextel (www.sprint.com), 
for instance, is just one company that maintains an extensive Web site where potential 
customers can learn more about products and services, and where current custom-
ers can access personal account information, send questions to customer service, and 
purchase additional products or services. With such extensive online services, Sprint 
Nextel does not have to maintain as many physical store locations as it would without 
these online services. We examine more examples of how e-business contributes to 
profitability throughout this chapter, especially as we focus on some of the business 
models for activity on the Internet.
Fundamental Models of e-Business
One way to get a better sense of how businesses are adapting to the opportunities 
available on the Internet is to identify e-business models. A business model represents 
a group of common characteristics and methods of doing business to generate sales 
revenues and reduce expenses. Each of the models discussed in the following text 
represents a primary e-business model. Regardless of the type of business model, 
planning often depends on if the e-business is a new firm or an existing firm adding an 
online presence—see Figure 16.7. It also helps to keep in mind that in order to generate 
sales revenues and earn profits, a business—especially an e-business—must meet the 
needs of its customers.
Understand the fundamental 
models of e-business.

The approach taken to creating an e-business plan will depend on whether  
you are establishing a new Internet business or adding an online component 
 to an existing business.

Macy’s and m-Commerce
Through m-commerce—mobile commerce, 
via smartphones and other mobile devices—
Macy’s is connecting with digital natives 
who like both fashion and bargains. The retailer 
operates 800 department stores in 45 states and rings up a 
total of $26 billion in annual sales. In the past few years, it has 
stepped up efforts to engage tech-savvy consumers between 
the ages of 13 and 30.
Macy’s created a special version of its popular Web site to 
fit the size of phone screens, so that customers can browse, 
look up product details, and buy at any time from any location. 
It also began inviting customers to subscribe to text messages 
announcing sales and delivering coupons. Response was so 
positive that Macy’s doubled the size of its text-message 
subscriber list in just six months. In addition, the retailer includes 
QR (quick response) codes—boxy, pixilated codes packed with 
information—in its ads and product displays. Customers use a 
free QR app to decode the code and access information such 
as product specifications, demonstration videos, and designer 
interviews. In one of the store’s most popular QR promotions, 
customers were treated to an exclusive video of beauty expert 
Bobbi Brown giving a brief makeup lesson. “We’re using 
mobile in every way possible to really complete a customer’s 
experience,” explains a Macy’s executive.

Business-to-Business (B2B) Model
Many e-businesses can be distinguished from others simply by 
their customer focus. For instance, some firms use the Internet 
mainly to conduct business with other businesses. These firms 
are generally referred to as having a business-to-business (or 
B2B) model.
When examining B2B firms, two clear types emerge. In the first 
type, the focus is simply on facilitating sales transactions between 
businesses. For example, Dell manufactures computers to specifica-
tions that customers enter on the Dell Web site (www.dell.com). A 
large portion of Dell’s online orders are from corporate clients who 
are well informed about the products they need and are looking for 
fairly priced, high-quality computer products that will be delivered 
quickly. Basically, by building only what is ordered, Dell reduces stor-
age and carrying costs and rarely is stuck with unsold inventory. By 
dealing directly with Dell, customers eliminate costs associated with 
wholesalers and retailers, thereby helping to reduce the price they pay 
for equipment.
A second, more complex type of B2B model involves a com-
pany and its suppliers. Today, suppliers use the Internet to bid 
on products and services they wish to sell to a customer and 
learn about the customer’s rules and procedures that must be 
followed. For example, Ford has developed a B2B model to link 
thousands of suppliers that sell the automobile maker parts, supplies, and raw 
materials worth millions of dollars each year. Although the B2B site is expensive 
to start and maintain, there are significant savings for Ford. Given the potential 
savings, it is no wonder that many other manufacturers and their suppliers are 
beginning to use the same kind of B2B systems that are used by the automaker. 
In fact, suppliers know that to be a “preferred” supplier for a large firm that may 
purchase large quantities of parts, supplies, or raw materials, they must be tied into 
the purchaser’s B2B system.
A new way to reach business customers around 
the globe. Alibaba.com is a business-to-business 
(B2B) global trade site that makes it easy for millions 
of importers and exporters to buy and sell products 
and services online.  Because it meets the needs of 
its customers, Alibaba.com has become a successful 
company with offices in more than 70 cities around the 
globe.

business-to-consumer (or B2C) 
model  a model used by firms that 
focus on conducting business with 
individual consumers
Business-to-Consumer (B2C) Model
In contrast with the B2B model, firms such as Barnes and Noble (www.barnesandnoble.
com) and online retailer Lands’ End (www.landsend.com) clearly are focused on 
individual consumers. These companies are referred to as having a business-to-
consumer (or B2C) model. In a B2C situation, understanding how consumers behave 
online is critical to a firm’s success. Typically, a business firm that uses a B2C model 
must answer the following questions:
●
●Will consumers use Web sites merely to simplify and speed up comparison shopping?
●
●Will consumers purchase services and products online or end up buying at a tra-
ditional retail store?
●
●What sorts of products and services are best suited for online consumer shopping?
In addition to providing round-the-clock global access to all kinds of products 
and services, B2C firms often attempt to build long-term relationships with their 
customers. Often, firms will make a special effort to make sure that the customer is 
satisfied and that problems, if any, are solved quickly. Specialized software also can 
help build good customer relationships. Tracking the decisions and buying prefer-
ences as customers navigate a Web site, for instance, helps management to make 
well-informed decisions about how best to serve online customers. In essence, this 
is Orbitz’s (www.orbitz.com) online selling approach. By tracking and analyzing 
customer data, the online travel company can provide individualized service to its 
customers. Although a “little special attention” may increase the cost of doing busi-
ness for a B2C firm, the customer’s repeated purchases will repay the investment 
many times over.
Today, B2B and B2C models are the most popular business models for e-business. 
And yet, there are other business models that perform specialized e-business activities 
to generate revenues. Most of the business models described in Table 16.2 are modified 
versions of the B2B and B2C models.
The Future of the Internet, Social 
Media, and e-Business
Since the beginning of commercial activity on the Internet, developments in computer 
technology, social media, and e-business have been rapid and formidable with 
spectacular successes such as Google, eBay, and Pinterest. However, a larger-than-usual 
number of technology companies struggled or even failed during the economic crisis. 
Today, most firms involved in the Internet, social media, and e-business use a more 
intelligent approach to development. The long-term view held by the vast majority of

Other Business Models that Perform Specialized e-Business Activities
Although modified versions of B2B or B2C, these business models perform specialized e-business activities to 
generate revenues.
Advertising e-business 
model
Advertisements that are displayed on a firm’s Web site in return for a fee. Examples include 
pop-up and banner advertisements on search engines and other popular Internet sites.
Brokerage e-business 
model
Online marketplaces where buyers and sellers are brought together to facilitate an exchange of 
goods and services. One example is eBay (www.ebay.com), which provides a site for buying and 
selling virtually anything.
Consumer-to-consumer 
model
Peer-to-peer software that allows individuals to share information over the Internet. 
Examples include Bit Torrent (www.bittorrent.com), which allows users to exchange digital 
media files.
Subscription and pay-
per-view e-business 
models
Content that is available only to users who pay a fee to gain access to a Web site. Examples include 
investment information provided by Standard & Poor’s (www.netadvantage.standardandpoors.com) 
and business research provided by Forrester Research, Inc. (www.forrester.com).

analysts is that the Internet, social media, and e-business will continue to expand to 
meet the needs of businesses and consumers.
Internet Growth Potential
To date, only a small percentage of the global population uses the Internet. At the 
beginning of 2012, estimates suggest that about 2.3 billion of the nearly 7 billion 
people in the world use the Web. 28 Clearly, there is much more growth opportunity. 
Americans comprise 11 percent of all Internet users.29 Of the 310 million people 
making up the American population, 239 million use the Internet. With approximately 
77 percent of the American population already using the Internet, potential growth in 
the United States is limited.30 On the other hand, the number of Internet users in the 
world’s developing countries is expected to increase dramatically.
Although the number of global Internet users is expected to increase, that’s only 
part of the story. Perhaps the more important question is why people are using the 
Internet. Primary reasons for using the Internet include the ability to connect with other 
people, to obtain information, or to purchase a firm’s products or services. Of particu-
lar interest to business firms is the growth of social media. The number of Facebook 
users, for example, increased from 664 million to 835 million in the 12-month period 
from March 2011 to March 2012. And because only 12 percent of the world popula-
tion currently uses Facebook, the number of Facebook users is expected to continue to 
increase for years to come.31 And the number of users for other social media sites like 
LinkedIn, Twitter, Pinterest, are also expected to increase.
Experts also predict that the number of companies using e-business to increase 
sales and reduce expenses will continue to increase. Firms that adapt existing business 
models to an online environment will continue to dominate development. For example, 
books, CDs, clothing, hotel accommodations, car rentals, and travel reservations are 
products and services well suited to online buying and selling. These products or ser-
vices will continue to be sold in the traditional way, as well as in a more cost-effective 
and efficient fashion over the Internet.
Ethical and Legal Concerns
The social and legal concerns for the Internet, social media, and e-business extend 
beyond those shared by all businesses. Essentially, the Internet is a new “frontier” 
without borders and without much control by governments or other organizations.
Ethics and Social Responsibility  Socially responsible and ethical behavior by 
individuals and businesses on the Internet are major concerns. For example, an ethi-
cally questionable practice in cyberspace is the unauthorized access and use of informa-
tion discovered through computerized tracking of users once they are connected to the 
Internet. Essentially, a user may visit a Web site and unknowingly receive a small piece 
of software code called a cookie. This cookie can track where the user goes on the 
Internet and measure how long the user stays at any particular Web site. Although this 
type of software may produce valuable customer information, it also can be viewed as 
an invasion of privacy, especially since users may not even be aware that their move-
ments are being monitored.
Besides the unauthorized use of cookies to track online behavior, there are several 
other threats to users’ privacy and confidentiality. Monitoring an employee’s com-
puter usage may be intended to help employers police unauthorized Internet use on 
company time. However, the same records can also give a firm the opportunity to 
observe what otherwise might be considered private and confidential information. 
Today, legal experts suggest that, at the very least, employers need to disclose the level 
of surveillance to their employees and consider the corporate motivation for monitor-
ing employees’ behavior.
Some firms also practice data mining. Data mining refers to the practice of search-
ing through data records looking for useful information. Customer registration forms 
typically require a variety of information before a user is given access to a site. Based

on an individual’s information, data mining analysis 
can then provide what might be considered private 
and confidential information about individuals. For 
instance, assume an individual frequents a Web site that 
provides information about a life-threatening disease. 
If this information is sent to an insurance company, the 
company might refuse to insure this individual, thinking 
that there is a higher risk associated with someone who 
wants more information about this disease.
Internet Crime  Because the Internet is often regarded as an 
unregulated frontier, both individuals and business users must 
be particularly aware of online risks and dangers. For exam-
ple, a general term that describes software designed to infil-
trate a computer system without the user’s consent is malware. 
Malware is often based on the creator’s criminal or malicious 
intent and can include computer viruses, spyware, deceptive 
adware, and other software capable of criminal activities. A 
more specific term used to describe disruptive software is com-
puter virus. A computer virus, which can originate anywhere 
in the world, is a software code designed to disrupt normal 
computer activities. The potentially devastating effects of both 
malware and computer viruses have given rise to a software 
security industry.
In addition to the risk of computer viruses, identity theft 
is one of the most common computer crimes that impacts 
both individuals and business users. A recent study conducted 
by Javelin Strategy and Research determined that more than 
11.6 million Americans were victims of identity theft in just 
one year.32 Most consumers are also concerned about fraud. 
Because the Internet allows easy creation of Web sites, access 
from anywhere in the world, and anonymity for the creator, it 
is almost impossible to know with certainty that the Web site, 
organization, or individuals that you believe you are interact-
ing with are what they seem. As always, caveat emptor (“let the 
buyer beware”) is a good suggestion to follow whether on the Internet or not.
Future Challenges for Computer Technology, 
Social Media, and e-Business
Today, more information is available than ever before. Although individuals and 
business users may think we are at the point of information overload, the amount 
of information will only increase in the future. In order to obtain more information 
in the future, both individuals and business users must consider the cost of obtaining 
information and computer technology. For a business, the ability to obtain information 
or sell products or services with a simple click or touch is expensive. In an effort 
to reduce expenses and improve accessibility, some companies and individuals are 
now using cloud computing. Cloud computing is a type of computer usage in which 
services stored on the Internet are provided to users on a temporary basis. When 
cloud computing is used, a third party makes processing power, software applications, 
databases, and storage available for on-demand use from anywhere. Instead of running 
software and storing data on their employer’s computer network or their individual 
computers, employees log onto the third party’s system and use (and pay for) only the 
applications and data storage they actually need. In addition to just cost, there are a 
number of external and internal factors that a business must consider.
Although the environmental forces at work are complex, it is useful to think of 
them as either internal or external forces that affect how a business uses computer

technology. Internal environmental forces are those that are closely associated 
with the actions and decisions taking place within a firm. As shown in Figure 16.8, 
typical internal forces include a firm’s planning activities, organizational struc-
ture, human resources, management decisions, information database, and available 
financing. A shortage of skilled employees needed for a specialized project, for 
instance, can undermine a firm’s ability to sell its services to clients. Unlike the 
external environmental forces affecting the firm, internal forces such as this one 
are more likely to be under the direct control of management. In this case, manage-
ment can either hire the needed staff or choose to pass over a prospective project. 
In addition to the obvious internal factors that affect how a company operates, a 
growing number of firms are concerned about how their use of technology affects 
the environment. The term green IT is now used to describe all of a firm’s activi-
ties to support a healthy environment and sustain the planet. Many offices, for 
example, are reducing the amount of paper they use by storing data and informa-
tion on computers.
In contrast, external environmental forces affect a company’s use of technology 
and originate outside the organization. These forces are unlikely to be controllable 
by a company. Instead, managers and employees of a company generally will react 
to these forces, attempting to shield the organization from any undue negative effects 
and finding ways to take advantage of opportunities in an ever-changing technology 
environment. The primary external environmental forces affecting a company’s use of 
technology include globalization, demographic, societal, economic, competitive, tech-
nological, and political and legal forces.
In this chapter, we have explored how both individuals and businesses use social 
media. We also examined how e-business is changing the way that firms do business. 
In Chapter 17, we examine a business firm’s need for information and why accounting 
is a major source of information for business.tes

Chapter 16   Exploring Social Media and e-Business

Examine why it is important for a business to use 
social media.
Millions of people of all ages use social media to interact with 
people and share ideas, personal information, and information 
about products and services. Today, more than two-thirds 
of online adults use some sort of social media platform like 
Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter, according to a recent Pew 
Internet Research Study. The primary reason for using social 
media is to stay in touch with family and friends. Other reasons 
include reconnecting with friends, connecting with people who 
share interests, making new friends, and reading comments 
by public figures. Early on, companies saw the potential in 
the sheer numbers of people using social media. Even though 
companies have used social media to share information about 
their products and services and improve customer service, many 
are still uncomfortable with this new method of communicating 
with customers because they do not have complete control over 
what is said about their products or services.
Discuss how businesses use social media tools.
Companies use social media to connect with customers, listen 
to stakeholders, provide customer service, provide information 
to customers, and engage customers in product development 
and formulation. To share social content (information about 
products and services), companies can use blogs, photos, videos, 
and podcasts. In addition, social media also enables shoppers 
to access opinions, recommendations, and referrals from others 
within and outside their own social circle. Rating and review 
sites are based on the idea that people trust the opinions of 
others when it comes to purchasing products and services. Social 
games are another area of growth in social media. A social game 
(like Angry Birds or FarmVille) is a multiplayer, competitive, 
goal-oriented activity with defined rules of engagement and 
online connectivity among a community of players. While some 
businesses elect to create their own game, others choose to place 
advertising into a game. 
Explain the business objectives for using social 
media.
Although its popularity is a recent phenomenon, many 
businesses are already using social media to achieve 
important goals and objectives. In fact, there are many 
ways for businesses to use social media to take advantage 
of business opportunities to build connections with other 
businesses and consumers. For example, businesses can use 
social media to build a community. Social media communities 
are social networks based on the relationships among people. 
Today, there are social communities for every interest, ethnic 
group, and lifestyle. Different types of communities include 
both forums and wikis. Other reasons for using social media 
include crisis and reputation management, listening to 
stakeholders, targeting customers, social media marketing,

Summary
Inside
Business
Every time Rovio uses Facebook, Twitter, and blogs to 
announce the release of a new Angry Birds game, it sets 
the social media world buzzing. Angry Birds Space took 
social games to new heights when the product introduc-
tion featured a NASA astronaut on the International 
Space Station using an Angry Bird toy and a balloon “pig” 
to demonstrate the principle of trajectory. Fans down-
loaded the new space game 10 million times in its first 
three days, a new record that also helped boost Rovio’s 
e-business revenue for the year.
Now that Angry Birds is an international download 
phenomenon, Rovio is planning Angry Birds theme parks 
in Europe, Angry Birds stores in China, and an Angry 
Birds movie for global release. How long will Rovio’s rev-
enues be flying high?
Questions
1.	 If you were a corporate executive, how could you 
measure the effectiveness of Rovio’s use of social 
media?

generating new product ideas, and recruiting employees. For 
a business, social media marketing is especially important 
because it can not only develop customer awareness, but also 
obtain sales leads and increase actual sales.
Describe how businesses develop a social media 
plan.
Before developing a plan to use social media, it is important 
to determine how social media can improve the organization’s 
overall performance and how it “fits” with a company’s other 
operational and promotional activities. Once it is determined 
how social media links to the company’s other activities, the 
first step is to listen to what customers like and don’t like about 
a company’s products or services. Typically, the second step is 
to establish social media objectives that are specific, measurable, 
achievable, realistic, and time oriented. After listening and 
establishing objectives, the third step is to identify the customer or 
market segment a business is trying to reach with a social media 
promotion. The fourth step is to select the social media tool that 
will be used to reach customers. While it is not necessary (or 
even advisable) to use all of the available tools, a company can 
use social media communities, blogs, photos, videos, podcasts, 
or games to reach potential or existing customers. Once social 
media tools have been identified, a company can implement and 
integrate the social media plan.
Both quantitative and qualitative measurements can be 
used to determine the effectiveness of a social media plan. 
Quantitative social media measurement consists of using 
numerical measurements. Key performance indicators (KPIs), 
for example, are quantitative measurements. Qualitative 
measurement is the process of accessing the opinions and 
beliefs about a brand and primarily uses sentiment analysis 
to categorize what is being said about a company.
Explain the meaning of e-business.
e-Business, or electronic business, can be defined as the 
organized effort of individuals to produce and sell, for a 
profit, the goods and services that satisfy society’s needs 
through the facilities available on the Internet. The human, 
material, information, and financial resources that any 
business requires are highly specialized for e-business. In an 
effort to reduce the cost of e-business resources, many firms 
have turned to outsourcing.
Using e-business activities, it is possible to satisfy new 
customer needs created by the Internet as well as traditional 
ones in unique ways. Meeting customer needs is especially 
important when an e-business is trying to earn profits by 
increasing sales and reducing expenses. Each source of rev-
enue flowing into the firm is referred to as a revenue stream.
Understand the fundamental models of e-business.
e-Business models focus attention on the identity of a firm’s 
customers. Firms that use the Internet mainly to conduct 
business with other businesses generally are referred to as 
having a business-to-business, or B2B, model. When examining 
B2B firms, two clear types emerge. In the first type of B2B, 
the focus is simply on facilitating sales transactions between 
businesses. A second, more complex type of the B2B model 
involves a company and its suppliers. In contrast to the focus 
of the B2B model, firms such as Amazon or eBay clearly are 
focused on individual buyers and are thus referred to as having 
a business-to-consumer, or B2C, model. In a B2C situation, 
understanding how consumers behave online is critical to the 
firm’s success. Successful B2C firms often make a special effort 
to build long-term relationships with their customers. While 
B2B and B2C models are the most popular e-business models, 
there are other models that perform specialized e-business 
activities to generate revenues (see Table 16.2).
Identify the factors that will affect the future of 
the Internet, social media, and e-business.
Since the beginning of commercial activity on the Internet, 
developments in computer technology, social media, and 
e-business have been rapid and formidable. Although a 
number of technology companies struggled or even failed 
during the recent economic crisis, most firms involved in 
computer technology, social media, and e-business today use  a 
more intelligent approach to development. The long-term view 
held by the vast majority of analysts is that use of the Internet 
will continue to expand along with related technologies. 
Because approximately 77 percent of Americans now have 
access to the Internet, potential growth is limited in the 
United States. On the other hand, only 2.3 billion of the 
nearly 7 billion people in the world use the Web. Clearly, the 
number of Internet users in the world’s developing countries 
is expected to increase dramatically.
The future of computer technology and the Internet 
will be influenced by advances in technology, the increas-
ing popularity of social media, and the increasing use of 
e-business. Other factors including ethics, social responsibil-
ity, and Internet crime will all impact the way that businesses 
and consumers use computer technology and the Internet. 
Although the environmental forces at work are complex, it 
is useful to think of them as either internal or external forces 
that affect how businesses use computer technology. Internal 
environmental forces are those that are closely associated 
with the actions and decisions taking place within a firm. 
In contrast, external environmental forces are those factors 
affecting an e-business originating outside an organization.

Part 6   Social Media, e-Business, and Accounting
When Luke Holden decided to open up a restaurant in 2009, 
using social media to promote it seemed like a no-brainer. 
“Word-of-mouth from friends is stronger than any other form of 
advertising in my opinion,” says the 27-year-old.
Holden didn’t start out in the restaurant business, though. 
After graduating from Georgetown University, he went to work 
on Wall Street as a financial analyst. A couple of years later, the 
banking crisis hit. When many of his coworkers started getting 
laid off, he began thinking about a backup plan for himself.
One thing Holden had noticed about New York City was that 
there were no restaurants serving good lobster rolls for a decent 
price: “They were all selling for $24, but you got only a little lob-
ster, a lot of mayo, and more filler,” he says. The Maine native 
sensed an opportunity. Plus, he knew where to find a good lob-
ster supplier: his dad, Jeff Holden, who owns a seafood process-
ing company in Portland, Maine. Luke had worked for his father 
when he was younger. If he purchased seafood directly from his 
father, rather than through a wholesaler, he figured he could offer 
a big lobster roll for a small price.
Because the restaurant business in New York City is very com-
petitive, Holden figured he better not quit his day job right away. 
Instead, he posted an ad on Craigslist to find a partner who 
could help him get the business up and running. That’s how he 
came across Ben Conniff. Conniff was fresh out of Yale and look-
ing to get into the restaurant business, too. After coming up with 
a business plan and raising some money, he and Holden hired 
some employees and opened Luke’s Lobster, a tiny eatery in New 
York City’s East Village. Conniff worked the day shift. Holden 
worked nights and weekends.
Fortunately, Luke’s Lobster quickly found a following. Better 
yet, customers got online to rave about the restaurant’s gener-
ously portioned rolls as well as their $15 price. Health- and 
­environmentally-conscious diners who want to know where their 
food is coming from were also attracted to the eatery. “We know 
the exact source of all our food,” Holden says. “We can trace it 
from the bottom of the ocean to the East Village.”
To further spread the word out about the restaurant, Holden 
and Conniff signed up with the social networking site Foursquare. 
Foursquare has a GPS-enabled, mobile-phone app that recom-
mends businesses in the area where you’re located based on 
what you and your friends in your network have said they like. 
People with the app can automatically “check in” with a business 
on Foursquare. They can let their friends know where they are 
and comment on their experience. When customers accumulate 
enough check-ins, they qualify for discounts and freebies. “Forget 
about loyalty cards and coupons. This makes it so it’s more digi-
tal and virtual,” Holden says about Foursquare. “It’s a digital wal-
let that you can carry around, and it’s constantly rewarding you.”
In addition to using Foursquare to get customers in the door, 
Holden and Conniff use it to help manage Luke’s. The data they 
get from Foursquare allows them to categorize their customers by 
gender, age, and arrival time. Analyzing the arrival times of cus-
tomers helps the restaurant ramp up for busy periods and offer 
specials when business is slow. 
The entrepreneurs didn’t limit their social networking to 
Foursquare, however. They use a combination of Facebook, 
Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, and Vimeo to post photos and videos 
about Luke’s, make an­nouncements about specials and contests, 
and provide links to the restaurant’s Web site and blog. The crew 
at Luke’s also “listens” to what people on the Web are saying 
about the restaurant and replies to them. “Responding to folks 
who mention us is our way of bringing them into the family and 
incorporating their feedback into our business,” Holden says.
Six months after setting up shop in the East Village, business 
was so good that Holden and Conniff were able to open up a sec-
ond location. At that point, Holden felt comfortable enough to 
leave the banking business. Since then, the men have opened up 
two more Luke’s Lobster restaurants in New York City, and one 
in Washington, D.C., which Holden’s brother, Bryan, operates. 
In 2011, the Luke’s chain rolled out a food truck in the New York 
area. The employees who work the truck use Twitter to update 
customers on its whereabouts.
Thanks to a good product and social networking strategy, New 
York City has been awash with information about Luke’s Lobster. 
HauteLiving.com even named it the city’s best lobster restaurant. 
What’s interesting is that without doing any traditional advertis-
ing whatsoever, Holden and Conniff have achieved so much  
success—including landing a spot on the Today Show with Kathie 
Lee Gifford. With a little more angling, it’s looking like they could 
net some cookbook or reality TV offers.33
Questions
1.	 What factors have contributed to the success of Luke’s 
Lobster?
2.	 Why have Holden and Conniff shunned traditional advertis-
ing? Is that a good idea? Why or why not?
3.	 Pick another type of business and describe how it could use 
social media networking to promote its products or services?

Chapter 16   Exploring Social Media and e-Business	
483
In February of 2004, Harvard University sophomore Mark 
Zuckerberg cofounded a Web site as a “facebook” (formerly the 
term for a physical photo album provided to a student body) 
where he and his classmates could post their photos and basic 
profile information. It caught on so quickly that just a month 
later, Zuckerberg opened it to students at other colleges and uni-
versities. By summer, Facebook had become a national phenom-
enon. Zuckerberg moved the company from his dorm room to 
California’s high-tech Silicon Valley, and he hired more engineers 
to write software for new features like the “wall,” where users 
post messages, photos, and videos.
Year after year, millions of new users logged on to “friend” 
friends, acquaintances, family, and classmates. Businesses 
also created pages to promote themselves and their prod-
ucts. Facebook’s rapid growth soon attracted the attention of 
Microsoft, which in 2007 invested $240 million to buy a tiny 
stake in the feisty firm. Zuckerberg and his team were already 
hard at work on a new round of upgrades to make Facebook even 
more social.
In early 2008, Facebook Chat went live. Although engineers 
had argued for a chat feature to allow private, real-time typed 
conversations between users, top managers weren’t enthusiastic.  
Engineers continued development and demonstrated its use again 
and again until they finally won Zuckerberg’s approval. Today, 
it remains one of the site’s most popular features. By 2009, 
Facebook had more users worldwide than it primary competitor, 
MySpace. A year later, Jesse Eisenberg starred as Mark Zuckerberg 
in The Social Network, an Academy Award–winning movie about the 
legal battles embroiled in Facebook’s financial bonanza.
Most of the company’s revenues come from advertising. 
Facebook knows a lot about its users, so it can help advertis-
ers like Domino’s Pizza reach highly targeted audiences, such 
as people in certain age groups and people who have “liked” a 
particular brand or product. Now, with nearly 1 billion users, 
Facebook earns more than $3 billion every year from advertising 
revenues alone. Because the majority of Facebook users in the 
United States, Brazil, India, and other large markets access their 
accounts via smartphone, the company is working on ways to sell 
more mobile advertising.
Facebook is also trying to find an appropriate balance between 
its advertisers’ need for marketing data and its users’ need for pri-
vacy. A few years ago, it violated its own privacy policy by allow-
ing advertisers access to some individually identifiable user data 
and by sharing some user data with outside software developers. 
After a public uproar and a government investigation, Facebook 
agreed in a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission that it 
would obtain the consent of users before making changes to their 
privacy settings. Under this settlement, Facebook must allow inde-
pendent auditors to check its privacy controls and activities every 
other year for the next 20 years.
Facebook became a publicly traded corporation in 2012 by 
selling $16 billion worth of common stock. The money it raised 
will fuel its global expansion and pay for the next generation 
of social media services to meet users’ needs now and into the 
future. “We don’t build services to make money,” CEO Mark 
Zuckerberg says. “We make money to build better services.”34
Questions
1.	 Every day, millions of people use Facebook to connect with 
friends, relatives, and businesses. As a result, Facebook is now 
the world’s leading social media company. In your opinion, 
what factors have led to Facebook’s success? 
2.	 What is Facebook’s e-business model, and how does this 
model fit its customers’ social media needs and interests? 
How does this social media company generate revenues and 
profits?
3.	 Because Facebook is a public corporation, it is now account-
able to shareholders. If you owned Facebook shares, how 
would you react to the CEO’s statement about making money 
to build better services, not building services to make money?

Part 6   Social Media, e-Business, and Accounting
Assignment
1.	 Have you ever used the Internet to purchase a product or 
service? If you answered yes, why did you purchase online as 
compared with purchasing the same product or service in a 
traditional retail store?
2.	 In your own words, describe whether the online shopping 
experience was a pleasant one. What factors contributed to 
your level of satisfaction or dissatisfaction?
3.	 If you answered no, describe why you prefer to shop in a tra-

3 	DEVELOPING CRITICAL-THINKING SKILLS
Millions of people around the world belong to social networks. 
And yet, you may want to consider the following facts before join-
ing or sharing personal information on a social site.
●
●
	Prospective or current employers often use the information you 
post on social sites to learn more about you.
●
●
	People who you do not know (or want to know) often can view 
your personal information.
●
●
	Although social sites have revised or improved their privacy pol-
icies, there are still too many reports of serious privacy abuses 
that affect too many users.
Today, the two most popular social sites are Facebook and Twitter. 
Both sites have privacy statements and attempt to protect users.
Assignment
1.	 Go to the Facebook Web site (www.facebook.com) and the 
Twitter Web site (www.twitter.com) and examine each site’s 
privacy policy. (Hint: Scroll down to the bottom of the home 
page and look for the link marked “Privacy.”)
2.	 Read each site’s privacy policy. Note any concerns that you 
feel could restrict the type of information you might want to 
share or lead to a violation of your personal privacy.
3.	 In a two-page report, answer at least the following questions.
a.	 What specific actions has each site taken to protect your 
privacy?
b.	 Are there weaknesses in the policies that could lead to 
abuses of your personal privacy?
c.	 Based on your research, which site do you think has the 
most effective privacy policy? Why?
d.	 How has this exercise changed the type of information you 
would share on the Facebook or Twitter Web site? Explain 
your answer.
4 	BUILDING TEAM SKILLS
After graduating from college with a degree in marketing, your 
first job was working in the marketing department for a fast-food 
chain located in the southwestern part of the United States. After 
three years, you were promoted and became director of the chain’s 
social media program. While monitoring posts about the company 
on Facebook and Twitter, you notice the following post from one 
of the firm’s former employees.
“Got fired today, but I was tired of serving low-quality food 
with expired expiration dates. Don’t eat there or any of the 
chain’s restaurants unless you want to get deathly ill.”
To make matters worse, a couple of other employees who had 
recently been fired chimed in and made posts of a similar nature.
Assignment
1.	 Working in small teams, create a response that can be used 
to convince consumers that your company is committed to 
food freshness and quality and that these posts were made by 
employees who had been terminated.
2.	 Choose a spokesperson that will read your response to the rest 
of the class.
3.	 As a class, discuss the pros and cons of each response devel-
oped by each team.
4.	 Ask all members of the class to vote on the best response.
5.	 Finally, each team should prepare a report for the company’s 
management that describes what happened and the response 
that was made to tell the company’s side of this issue and 
restore consumer confidence in the firm’s food products.
5 	RESEARCHING DIFFERENT CAREERS
Today, there are a wide assortment of career opportunities in com-
panies that are involved in technology, social media, and e-business. 
In addition to existing business, there are new technology companies 
springing up every day. In many cases, these firms want people with 
a fresh outlook on how technology, social media, and e-business 
companies can differentiate their products or services from those of 
other companies in the same industry. They often prefer individu-
als without preconceived notions about how to proceed. Web site 
managers, designers, creative artists, and content specialists are just 
a few of the positions available. Many large online job sites, such as 
Monster.com, can help you to find out about employment opportu-
nities and the special skills required for various jobs.
Assignment
1.	 Identify a Web site that provides information about careers in 
technology, social media, or e-business.
2.	 Summarize the positions that appear to be in high demand.
3.	 What are some of the special skills required to fill these jobs?
4.	 What salaries and benefits typically are associated with these 
positions?
5.	 Which job seems most appealing to you personally? Why?

PricewaterhouseCoopers Innovates Through PowerPitch
How do you get accounting and consulting specialists to think creatively about future busi-
ness possibilities? With 766 offices in 158 nations, New York–based PricewaterhouseCoopers 
(now known as PwC) is one of the industry-leading “Big Four” accounting firms. It offers 
a wide range of accounting, auditing, consulting, and tax services—all designed to provide 
information to clients in many industries, including almost 90 percent of the Fortune Global 
500 companies. From a one-person operation in 1849, PwC has grown into a multina-
tional giant with more than 169,000 employees.
To keep annual revenue growing beyond $30 billion, the company is looking for cut-
ting-edge ideas as the foundation of future multimillion-dollar businesses. It recently held 
a contest called “PowerPitch,” inviting teams of U.S. employees to pitch their best ideas 
for new businesses. The reward: $100,000 to the winning team, bragging rights, and the 
opportunity to shepherd the idea through the development process.
During the contest’s first stage, hundreds of PwC teams submitted a grand total of 
779 business proposals. Then all U.S. employees and a panel of PwC partners reviewed 
and voted on them. Of those proposals, 25 were chosen as semifinalists, and the five most 
promising moved on to become finalists. The finalist teams traveled to New York City to 
pitch to PwC’s top executives (with thousands of colleagues watching via live webcast). 
After some discussion, the judges chose a grand prize winner. In a surprise move, they also 
backed all five of the finalist proposals for further development and sent the semifinalist 
proposals to an incubation group for further study. Just as important, PowerPitch proved 
that PwC welcomes and rewards bold new ideas—“the kind of program that becomes a 
talent magnet,” says the U.S. chairman.
Meanwhile, PwC is already expanding into new services that will help corporate clients 
achieve their goals. For example, it now conducts “green” audits, examining a client’s envi-
ronmental activities at regular intervals. The audits show how much progress the client is 
making toward long-term sustainability targets such as conserving natural resources and 
energy, reducing emissions, and making products and processes as eco-friendly as possible.1

nformation—that’s what this chapter is all about! We begin this chapter with 
information about PricewaterhouseCoopers—the company profiled in the Inside 
Business feature. For this multinational accounting firm, one of its most important 
goals is to provide information to business clients so that managers and employees can 
increase sales, reduce expenses, and improve a firm’s operating procedures. This same 
information is often shared with people outside the company—its lenders, suppliers, 
and investors. The “bottom line” is that without management and accounting informa-
tion, managers can’t make decisions, investors can’t evaluate potential investments, and 
lenders and suppliers can’t extend credit to a business firm. 
We begin this chapter by describing why employees need information. The first 
three major sections in this chapter answer the following questions:
●
●How can information reduce risk when making a decision?
●
●What is a management information system?
●
●How do employees use a management information system?
Next, we look at why accounting information is important, attempts to improve 
financial reporting, and careers in the accounting industry. Then we examine the basic

accounting equation and the three most important financial statements: the balance 
sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows. Finally, we take a look at 
how managers evaluate the firm’s financial health.
How Can Information Reduce Risk  
When Making a Decision?
As we noted in Chapter 1, information is one of the four major resources (along with 
material, human, and financial resources) managers must have to operate a business. 
Although a successful business uses all four resources efficiently, it is information that 
helps managers reduce risk when making a decision.
Information and Risk
To improve the decision-making process and reduce risk, the information used by 
individuals and business firms must be relevant or useful to meet a specific need. Using 
relevant information results in better decisions.
Relevant information → Better intelligence and knowledge → Better decisions
For businesses, better intelligence and knowledge that lead to better decisions are 
especially important because they can provide a competitive edge over competitors 
and improve a firm’s profits. 
Theoretically, with accurate and complete information, there is no risk whatsoever. 
On the other hand, a decision made without any information is a gamble. These two 
extreme situations are rare in business. For the most part, business decision makers 
see themselves located someplace between the extremes. As illustrated in Figure 17.1, 
when the amount of available information is high, there is less risk; when the amount 
of available information is low, there is more risk.
Suppose that a marketing manager for Procter & Gamble (P&G) responsible for 
the promotion of a well-known shampoo such as Pantene Pro-V has called a meeting 
of key people within her department to consider the selection of a new magazine adver-
tisement. The company’s advertising agency has submitted two new advertisements in 
sealed envelopes. Neither the manager nor any of her team has seen them before. Only 
one selection will be made for the new advertising campaign. Which advertisement 
should be chosen?
Without any further information, the team might as well make the decision by flip-
ping a coin. If, however, team members were allowed to open the envelopes and exam-
ine the advertisements, they would have more information. If, in addition to allowing 
them to examine the advertisements, the marketing manager circulated a report con-
taining the reactions of a group of target consumers to each of the two advertisements, 
the team would have even more information with which to work. Thus, information, 
when understood properly, produces knowledge and empowers managers and employ-
ees to make better decisions.
1
Examine how information can 
reduce risk when making a 
decision.
When the amount of available information is high, managers tend to make better 
decisions. On the other hand, when the amount of information is low, there is a 
high risk of making a poor decision.

Information Rules
Marketing research continues to show that discounts 
influence almost all car buyers. Simply put, if dealers 
lower their prices, they will sell more cars. This 
relationship between buyer behavior and price can 
be thought of as an information rule that usually will 
guide the marketing manager correctly. An information 
rule emerges when research confirms the same results 
each time that it studies the same or a similar set of 
circumstances.
Because of the volume of information they receive each 
day and their need to make decisions on a daily basis, busi-
nesspeople try to accumulate information rules to shorten the 
time they spend analyzing choices. Information rules are the 
“great simplifiers” for all decision makers. Business research is 
continuously looking for new rules that can be put to good use 
and looking to discredit old ones that are no longer valid. This 
ongoing process is necessary because business conditions rarely 
stay the same for very long.
The Difference Between Data  
and Information
Many people use the terms data and information 
interchangeably, but the two differ in important ways. Data 
are numerical or verbal descriptions that usually result from 
some sort of measurement. (The word data is plural; the 
singular form is datum.) Your current wage level, the amount 
of last year’s after-tax profit for ExxonMobil Corporation, 
and the current retail prices of Honda automobiles are all 
data. Most people think of data as being numerical only, 
but they can be nonnumerical as well. A description of an 
individual as a “tall, athletic person with short, dark hair” 
certainly would qualify as data.
Information is data presented in a form that is useful for 
a specific purpose. Suppose that a human resources manager wants 
to compare the wages paid to male and female employees over a 
period of five years. The manager might begin with a stack of com-
puter printouts listing every person employed by the firm, along 
with each employee’s current and past wages. The manager would 
be hard pressed to make any sense of all the names and numbers. 
Such printouts consist of data rather than information.
Now suppose that the manager uses a computer to graph the 
average wages paid to men and to women in each of the five years. 
The result is information because the manager can use it for the 
purpose at hand—to compare wages paid to men with those paid 
to women over the five-year period. For a manager, information 
presented in a practical, useful form such as a graph simplifies the 
decision-making process.
Knowledge Management
The average company maintains a great deal of data that can be 
transformed into information. Typical data include records pertaining 
to personnel, inventory, sales, and accounting. Often each type of data 
is stored in individual departments within an organization. However, 
the data can be used more effectively when they are organized into a

database. A database is a single collection of data and information stored in one place that 
can be used by people throughout an organization to make decisions. Although databases 
are important, the way the data and information are used is even more important—and 
more valuable to the firm. As a result, management information experts now use the term 
knowledge management (KM) to describe a firm’s procedures for generating, using, 
and sharing the data and information. Typically, data, information, databases, and KM all 
become important parts of a firm’s management information system.
What Is a Management Information 
System?
A management information system (MIS) is a system that provides managers and 
employees with the information they need to perform their jobs as effectively as possible. 
The purpose of an MIS (sometimes referred to as an information technology system 
or simply IT system) is to distribute timely and useful information from both internal 
and external sources to the managers and employees who need it (see Figure 17.2). 
Today, most medium-sized to large business firms have an information technology (IT) 
officer. An information technology (IT) officer is a manager at the executive level 
who is responsible for ensuring that a firm has the equipment necessary to provide the 
information the firm’s employees and managers need to make effective decisions.
Today’s typical MIS is built around a computerized system of record-keeping and 
communications software so that it can provide information based on a wide variety 
of data. After all, the goal is to provide needed information to all employees and 
managers.
A Firm’s Information Requirements
Employees and managers have to plan for the future, implement their plans in the 
present, and evaluate results against what has been accomplished in the past. Of 
course, the specific types of information they need depend on their work area and on 
their level within the firm.
Today, many firms are organized into five areas of management: finance, opera-
tions, marketing, human resources, and administration. Managers in each of these 
areas need specific information in order to make decisions.

Chapter 17   Using Management and Accounting Information

●
●Financial managers are obviously most concerned with a firm’s finances. They 
must ensure that the firm’s managers and employees, lenders and suppliers, 
stockholders and potential investors, and government agencies have the infor-
mation they need to measure the financial health of the firm. Along with the 
firm’s accountants, financial managers study its debts and receivables, cash 
flow, future capitalization needs, financial statements, and other accounting 
information. Of equal importance to financial managers is information about 
the present state of the economy, interest rates, and predictions of business 
conditions in the future. 
●
●Operations managers are concerned with present and future sales levels, current 
inventory levels of work in process and finished goods, and the availability and 
cost of the resources required to produce products and services. They also must 
keep abreast of any innovative production technology that might be useful to 
the firm.
●
●Marketing managers need to have detailed information about a firm’s products 
and services and those offered by competitors. Such information includes pricing 
strategies, new promotional campaigns, and products that competitors are test 
marketing. Information concerning the firm’s customers, current and projected 
market share, and new and pending product legislation is also important to mar-
keting managers.
●
●Human resources managers must be aware of anything that pertains to a firm’s 
employees. Key examples include current wage levels and benefits packages both 
within the firm and in firms that compete for valuable employees, current legisla-
tion and court decisions that affect employment practices, union activities, and the 
firm’s plans for growth, expansion, or mergers.
●
●Administrative managers are responsible for the overall management of the orga-
nization. Thus, they are concerned with the coordination of information—just 
as they are concerned with the coordination of material, human, and financial 
resources.
Administrators must ensure that all employees have access to the information they 
need to do their jobs. Administrative managers must also ensure that the informa-
tion is used in a consistent manner throughout the firm. Suppose, 
for example, that General Electric (GE) is designing a new plant 
that will open in five years. GE’s management will want answers 
to many questions: Is the capacity of the plant consistent with 
marketing plans based on sales projections? Will human resources 
managers be able to staff the plant on the basis of employment fore-
casts? And do sales projections indicate enough income to cover 
the expected cost of the plant? Next, administrative managers must 
make sure that all managers and employees are able to use the IT 
that is available. Certainly, this requires that all employees receive 
the skills training required to use the firm’s MIS. Finally, adminis-
trative managers must commit to the costs of updating the firm’s 
MIS and providing additional training when necessary.
Size and Complexity of the System
An MIS must be tailored to the needs of the organization it serves. 
In some firms, a tendency to save on initial costs may result in a 
system that is too small or overly simple. Such a system generally 
ends up serving only one or two management levels or a single 
department. Managers in other departments “give up” on the 
system as soon as they find that it cannot process their data.
Almost as bad is an MIS that is too large or too complex for 
the organization. Unused capacity and complexity do nothing but 
increase the cost of owning and operating the system. In addition, a 
system that is difficult to use probably will not be used at all.

Is all this information really necessary? Today, 
we live in an information society—that is, a society 
in which large groups of individuals, employees, and 
managers generate or depend on information to 
perform everyday tasks. As a result, all three groups 
often complain that they have too much information.  
For many, the problem is not lack of information, but 
how to determine what information is really needed?

How Do Employees Use a Management 
Information System?
To provide information, a management information system (MIS) must perform five 
specific functions. It must (1) collect data, (2) store the data, (3) update the data, 
(4) process the data into information, and (5) present the information to users (see 
Figure 17.3).
Step 1: Collecting Data
A firm’s employees, with the help of an MIS system, must gather the data and 
information needed to establish the firm’s database. The database should include all 
past and current data that may be useful in managing the firm. Clearly, the data entered 
into the system must be relevant to the needs of the firm’s managers. And perhaps most 
important, the data must be accurate. Irrelevant data are simply useless; inaccurate 
data can be disastrous. There are two data sources: internal and external.
Internal Sources of Data  Typically, most of the data gathered for an MIS come 
from internal sources. The most common internal sources of information are managers 
and employees, company records and reports, and minutes of meetings.
Past and present accounting data can also provide information about the firm’s 
transactions with customers, creditors, and suppliers. Sales reports are a source of data 
on sales, pricing strategies, and the effectiveness of promotional campaigns. Human 
resources records are useful as a source of data on wage and benefits levels, hiring pat-
terns, employee turnover, and other personnel variables.

data processing  the 
transformation of data into a form 
that is useful for a specific purpose
Present and past production forecasts also should be included in the firm’s data-
base, along with information indicating how well these forecasts predicted actual events. 
Specific plans and management decisions—regarding capital expansion and new product 
development, for example—should also be incorporated into the MIS system.
External Sources of Data  External sources of data include customers, suppliers, 
financial institutions and banks, trade and business publications, industry conferences, 
online computer services, lawyers, government sources, and firms that specialize in gath-
ering data for organizations. For example, a marketing research company may acquire 
sales forecasts pertaining to product demand, consumer tastes, and other marketing vari-
ables. Suppliers are also an excellent source of information about the future availability 
and costs of raw materials and component parts. Bankers can often provide valuable 
economic insights and projections. The information furnished by trade and business pub-
lications and industry conferences is usually concerned as much with future projections 
as with present conditions. Legal issues and court decisions that may affect a firm are 
discussed occasionally in local newspapers and, more often, in specialized publications 
such as the Wall Street Journal, Fortune, and BusinessWeek. Government publications 
such as the Monthly Labor Review and the Federal Reserve Bulletin are also quite useful 
as sources of external data, as are a number of online computer services.
Whether the source of the data is internal or external, always remember the fol-
lowing three cautions:
	 1.	The cost of obtaining data from some external sources, such as marketing research 
firms, can be quite high.
	 2.	Outdated or incomplete data usually yield inaccurate information.
	 3.	Although computers generally do not make mistakes, the people who use them can 
make or cause errors. When data (or information) and your judgment disagree, 
always check the data.
Step 2: Storing Data
An MIS must be capable of storing data until they are needed. Typically, the method 
chosen to store data depends on the size and needs of the organization. Small businesses 
may enter data and then store them directly on the hard drive inside an employee’s 
computer. Generally, medium-sized to large businesses store data in a larger computer 
system and provide access to employees through a computer network. Today, networks 
take on many configurations and are designed by specialists who work with a firm’s IT 
personnel to decide on what’s best for the company.
Step 3: Updating Data
Today, an MIS must be able to update stored data regularly to ensure that the 
information presented to managers and employees is accurate, complete, and up-to-
date. The frequency with which the data are updated depends on how fast they change 
and how often they are used. When it is vital to have current data, updating may occur 
as soon as the new data are available. For example, Giant Food Stores, a grocery 
store chain operating in the eastern part of the United States, has cash registers that 
automatically transmit data on each item sold to a central computer. The computer 
adjusts the store’s inventory records accordingly. In some systems, the computer may 
even be programmed to reorder items whose inventories fall below some specified 
level. Data and information may also be entered into a firm’s data bank at certain 
intervals—every 24 hours, weekly, or monthly.
Step 4: Processing Data
Some data are used in the form in which they are stored, whereas other data require 
processing to extract, highlight, or summarize the information they contain. Data 
processing is the transformation of data into a form that is useful for a specific purpose.

Part 6   Social Media, e-Business, and Accounting
For verbal data, this processing consists mainly of extract-
ing the pertinent material from storage and combining it into 
a report. Most business data, however, are in the form of 
numbers—large groups of numbers, such as daily sales totals 
or production costs for a specific product. Fortunately, com-
puters can be programmed to process such large volumes of 
numbers quickly. While such groups of numbers may be diffi-
cult to handle and to comprehend, their contents can be sum-
marized through the use of statistics. A statistic is a measure 
that summarizes a particular characteristic of an entire group 
of numbers.
Step 5: Presenting Information
An MIS must be capable of presenting information in a usable 
form. That is, the method of presentation—reports, tables, 
graphs, or charts, for example—must be appropriate for the 
information itself and for the uses to which it will be put.
Business Reports  Verbal information may be presented in 
list or paragraph form. Employees often are asked to prepare 
formal business reports. A typical business report includes (1) an 
introduction, (2) the body of the report, (3) the conclusions, and 
(4) the recommendations.
The introduction, which sets the stage for the remain-
der of the report, describes the problem to be studied in the 
report, identifies the research techniques that were used, and 
previews the material that will be presented in the report. The 
body of the report should objectively describe the facts that 
were discovered in the process of completing the report. The 
body also should provide a foundation for the conclusions and 
the recommendations. The conclusions are statements of fact 
that describe the findings contained in the report. Conclusions 
should be specific, practical, and based on the evidence in the 
report. The recommendations section presents suggestions on 
how the problem might be solved. Like the conclusions, the 
recommendations should be specific, practical, and based on 
the evidence.
Visual Displays and Tables  A visual display can also be used 
to present information and may be a diagram that ­represents 
several items of information in a manner that makes comparison easier. Figure 17.4 
illustrates examples of visual displays generated by a computer. Typical visual displays 
include
●
●graphs;
●
●bar charts; and
●
●pie charts.
A tabular display is used to present verbal or numerical information in columns 
and rows. It is most useful in presenting information about two or more related vari-
ables. A table, for example, can be used to illustrate the number of salespeople in each 
region of the country, sales for different types of products, and total sales for all prod-
ucts (see Table 17.1). Information that is to be manipulated—for example, to calculate 
loan payments—is usually displayed in tabular form.
Tabular displays generally have less impact than visual displays. However, display-
ing the information that could be contained in a multicolumn table such as the one 
shown in Table 17.1 would require several bar or pie charts.

statistic  a measure that

Who are the people who use information? Although 
the primary users of information are a firm’s managers 
and employees, parties outside the organization—lenders, 
suppliers, stockholders, and government agencies—are also 
interested in the firm’s information. In fact, both managers 
and employees and outside groups often examine a firm’s 
annual report to determine the financial health of a firm.

Making Smart Decisions
How do managers and employees sort out relevant and useful information from 
the spam, junk mail, and useless data? In addition to the steps described in the last 
section (collecting data, storing data, updating data, processing data, and presenting 
information) three different software applications can actually help to improve and 
speed the decision-making process for people at different levels within an organization. 
First, a decision-support system (DSS) is a type of software program that provides 
relevant data and information to help a firm’s employees make decisions. It also can be 
used to determine the effect of changing different variables and answer “what if” type 
questions. For example, a manager at Michigan-based Pulte Homes may use a DSS to 
determine prices for new homes built in an upscale, luxury subdivision. By entering 
the number of homes that will be built along with different costs associated with land, 
labor, materials, building permits, promotional costs, and all other costs, a DSS can 
help to determine a base price for each new home. It is also possible to increase or 
decrease the building costs and determine new home prices for each set of assumptions 
with a DSS. Although similar to a DSS, an executive information system (EIS) is a 
computer-based system that facilitates and supports the decision-making needs of top 
managers and senior executives by providing easy access to both internal and external 
information.
An expert system is a type of computer program that uses artificial intelli-
gence to imitate a human’s ability to think. An expert system uses a set of rules that 
analyze information supplied by the user about a particular activity or problem. 
Based on the information supplied, the expert system then provides recommenda-
tions or suggests specific actions in order to help make decisions. Expert systems, 
for example, have been used to schedule manufacturing tasks, diagnose illnesses, 
determine credit limits for credit-card customers, evaluate loan applications, and 
develop electronic games.

From factory floors to jetliner cockpits to 
corporate boardrooms, tablet computers 
have changed the way some businesses 
manage information—and created new challenges 
along the way. Jackson Kayak, a Tennessee-based kayak 
manufacturer, put iPads into the hands of 65 employees with 
the goal of improving efficiency and enhancing marketing. 
Until the company located and installed fully-functional apps 
for production management and other specific uses, it had to 
substitute iPhone apps and enlarge the images to fit the roomier 
iPad screen. Knowing that many kayak buyers are also adopting 
iPads, the company created its own app to introduce itself and 
its products.

Chapter 17   Using Management and Accounting Information	
497
Why Accounting Information Is 
Important
In today’s competitive business environment, all successful firms use information 
to make decisions. In order to obtain needed information, firms use a management 
information system like the one described in the first part of this chapter. Executives, 
managers, and employees also rely on the firm’s accounting system to provide needed 
financial information. Accounting is the process of systematically collecting, analyzing, 
and reporting financial information. Just for a moment, think about the following 
three questions:
	 1.	How much profit did a business earn last year?
	 2.	How much tax does a business owe the Internal Revenue Service?
	 3.	How much cash does a business have to pay lenders and suppliers?
In each case, the firm’s accountants and its accounting system provide the answers 
to these questions and many others. Although accounting information can be used to 
answer questions about what has happened in the past, it can also be used to help make 
decisions about the future. 
Because the information provided by a firm’s accountants and its accounting sys-
tem is so important, managers and other groups interested in a business firm’s finan-
cial records must be able to “trust the numbers.” To improve the accuracy of a firm’s 
accounting information and its financial statements, businesses rely on audits con-
ducted by accountants employed by public accounting firms. 
Why Audited Financial Statements Are Important
An audit is an examination of a company’s financial statements and the accounting 
practices that produced them. The purpose of an audit is to make sure that a firm’s 
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAPs). GAAPs have been developed to provide an accepted 
set of guidelines and practices for U.S. companies reporting 
financial information and the accounting profession. At the time 
of publication, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), 
which establishes and improves accounting standards for U.S. 
companies, is working toward establishing a new set of standards 
that combines GAAPs with the International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) to create one set of accounting standards that 
can be used by both U.S. and multinational firms. Created by 
the International Accounting Standards Board, IFRS are now 
used in more than 100 different countries around the world. For 
multinational firms, the benefits of global accounting standards 
are huge because preparing financial statements and accounting 
records that meet global standards saves both time and money. 
According to many accounting experts, it’s not a question of 
whether IFRS guidelines will be adopted in the United States, but 
when.2
If an accountant determines that a firm’s financial statements 
present financial information fairly and conform to GAAPs, then he 
or she will issue the following statement:
In our opinion, the financial statements . . . present fairly, in 
all material respects . . . in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles.
Although an audit and the resulting report do not guarantee 
that a company has not “cooked” the books, it does imply that, on 
the whole, the company has followed GAAPs. Bankers, creditors,

accounting information and

Two large accounting scandals! Many experts 
believe that top executives at home mortgage lenders 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac used fraudulent 
accounting tactics to enhance each firm’s financial 
information. Unfortunately, these two firms were not 
the only companies involved in accounting scandals in 
recent years—there were many more. As a result, the 
demands for improved accounting procedures made 
by lenders, investors, employees, government agencies, 
and other interested groups led to the passage of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

investors, and government agencies are willing to rely on an auditor’s opinion because 
of the historically ethical reputation and independence of auditors and accounting firms. 
Finally, it should be noted that without the audit function and GAAPs, there would be 
very little oversight or supervision. The validity of a firm’s financial statements and its 
accounting records would drop quickly, and firms would find it difficult to obtain debt 
financing, acquire goods and services from suppliers, find investor financing, or prepare 
documents requested by government agencies.
Reform: The Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002
According to John Bogle, founder of Vanguard Mutual Funds, “Investing is an act of 
faith. Without that faith—that reported numbers reflect reality, that companies are 
being run honestly, that Wall Street is playing it straight, and that investors aren’t being 
hoodwinked—our capital markets simply can’t function.”3 In reality, what Mr. Bogle says 
is true. To help ensure that corporate financial information is accurate and to prevent 
the type of accounting scandals that have occurred in the past,  Congress enacted the 
Sarbanes–Oxley Act in 2002. Key components include the following:4
●
●The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is required to establish a full-time 
five-member federal oversight board that will police the accounting industry.
●
●Chief executive and financial officers are required to certify periodic financial 
reports and are liable for intentional violations of securities reporting requirements.
●
●Accounting firms are prohibited from providing many types of non-audit and 
consulting services to the companies they audit.
●
●Auditors must maintain financial documents and audit 
work papers for five years.
●
●Auditors, accountants, and employees can be imprisoned for 
up to 20 years and subject to fines for destroying financial 
documents and willful violations of the securities laws.
●
●A public corporation must change its lead auditing firm 
every five years.
●
●There is added protection for whistle-blowers who report 
violations of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act.
Although most people welcome the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, 
complex rules make compliance more expensive and time-
consuming for corporate management and more difficult for 
accounting firms. Yet, most people agree that the cost of compli-
ance is justified. 
Different Types of Accounting
Although many people think that all accountants do the same 
tasks, there are special areas of expertise within the accounting 
industry. In fact, accounting is usually broken down into two 
broad categories: managerial and financial.
Managerial accounting provides managers and employees 
within the organization with the information needed to make 
decisions about a firm’s financing, investing, marketing, and 
operating activities. By using managerial accounting informa-
tion, both managers and employees can evaluate how well they 
have done in the past and what they can expect in the future. 
Financial accounting, on the other hand, generates financial 
statements and reports for interested people outside of an orga-
nization. Typically, stockholders, financial analysts, bankers, 
lenders, suppliers, government agencies, and other interested 
groups use the information provided by financial accounting to 
determine how well a business firm has achieved its goals. In

(CPA)  an individual who has met 
state requirements for accounting 
education and experience and 
has passed a rigorous accounting 
examination
addition to managerial and financial accounting, addi-
tional special areas of accounting include the following:
●
●cost accounting—determining the cost of producing 
specific products or services;
●
●tax accounting—planning tax strategy and prepar-
ing tax returns for firms or individuals;
●
●government accounting—providing basic account-
ing services to ensure that tax revenues are collected 
and used to meet the goals of state, local, and federal 
agencies; and
●
●not-for-profit accounting—helping not-for-profit organiza-
tions to account for all donations and expenditures.
Careers in Accounting
According to the Occupational Outlook Handbook, published 
by the Department of Labor, job opportunities for accountants, as 
well as auditors in the accounting area, are expected to experience 
a 16 percent increase or about average employment growth 
between now and the year 2020.5 And more good news: Starting 
salaries for employees in the accounting industry are often higher 
than the starting salaries for other entry-level positions.
Accounting can be an exciting and rewarding career. To be 
successful in the accounting industry, employees must
●
●Be responsible, honest, and ethical.
●
●Have a strong background in financial management.
●
●Know how to use a computer and software to process data 
into accounting information.
●
●Be able to communicate with people who need accounting 
information.
Today, accountants generally are classified as either pri-
vate accountants or public accountants. A private accountant is 
employed by a specific organization. On the other hand, a pub-
lic accountant works on a fee basis for clients and may be self-
employed or be the employee of an accounting firm. Accounting 
firms range in size from one-person operations to huge interna-
tional firms with hundreds of accounting partners and thousands 
of employees. Today, the largest accounting firms, sometimes 
referred to as the “Big Four,” are PricewaterhouseCoopers 
(PwC), Ernst & Young, KPMG, and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.
Typically, public accounting firms include on their staffs at least one certified
public accountant (CPA), an individual who has met state requirements for account-
ing education and experience and has passed a rigorous accounting examination. More 
information about general requirements and the CPA profession can be obtained by 
contacting the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) at www.aicpa.org. State require-
ments usually include a college degree or a specified number of hours of college course 
work and generally from one to three years of on-the-job experience. Details regarding 
specific state requirements for practice as a CPA can be obtained by contacting the 
state’s board of accountancy.
Certification as a CPA brings both status and responsibility. Publicly traded cor-
porations must hire an independent certified public accountant to audit their financial 
statements. In addition to auditing a corporation’s financial statements, typical services 
performed by CPAs include planning and preparing tax returns, determining the true 
cost of producing and marketing a firm’s goods or services, and compiling the financial 
information needed to make major management decisions. Fees for the services pro-
vided by CPAs generally range from $50 to $300 an hour.
Social
Media
The Big Four Go Social
Why does a CPA tweet? All of the Big Four 
accounting firms are active on Twitter, as well as 
posting messages, contents, and photos on Face-
book, listing job opening on LinkedIn, and posting videos 
and commercials on YouTube. The idea is to connect with 
potential job candidates, interact with clients and potential 
clients, engage employees, showcase the firms’ expertise, 
and  polish their reputations.
For example, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & 
Young, KPMG, and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu recruit 
new graduates and experienced professionals by posting 
job openings on Facebook. They also use Twitter 
and LinkedIn to publicize studies they’ve conducted, 
comment  on  business conditions, and have special 
Facebook pages just for “alumni”—former staff members—
to network.

The Accounting Equation and the 
Balance Sheet
At the beginning of this chapter, information was defined as data presented in a form that 
is useful for a specific purpose. Now, we examine how financial data is transformed into 
financial information and reported on three very important financial statements—the 
balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows. We begin by describing 
why the fundamental accounting equation is the basis for a firm’s balance sheet.
The Accounting Equation
The accounting equation is a simple statement that forms the basis for the accounting 
process. This equation shows the relationship between a firm’s assets, liabilities, and 
owners’ equity.
●
●Assets are the resources a business owns—cash, inventory, equipment, and real 
estate.
●
●Liabilities are the firm’s debts—borrowed money it owes to others that must be 
repaid.
●
●Owners’ equity is the difference between total assets and total liabilities—what 
would be left for the owners if the firm’s assets were sold and the money used to 
pay off its liabilities.
The relationship between assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity is shown by the 
following accounting equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ equity
The dollar total of all of a firm’s assets cannot equal more than the total funds 
obtained by borrowing money (liabilities) and the investment of the owner(s). Whether 
a business is a small corner grocery store or a giant corporation such as General Mills, 
its assets must equal the sum of its liabilities and owners’ equity. To use this equa-
tion, a firm’s accountants must record raw data—that is, the firm’s day-to-day finan-
cial transactions—using the double-entry system of bookkeeping. The double-entry
bookkeeping system is a system in which each financial transaction is recorded as two 
separate accounting entries to maintain the balance shown in the accounting equation. 
All of the financial transactions can now be summarized in the firm’s financial state-
ments. This information is presented in a standardized format to make the statements 
as accessible as possible to the various people who may be interested in the firm’s finan-
cial affairs—managers, employees, lenders, suppliers, stockholders, potential investors, 
and government agencies. In fact the form of the financial statements is pretty much 
the same for all businesses, from a neighborhood video store or small dry cleaner to 
giant conglomerates such as Home Depot, Boeing, and Bank of America. A firm’s 
financial statements are prepared at least once a year and included in the firm’s annual 
report. An annual report is a report distributed to stockholders and other interested 
parties that describes a firm’s operating activities and its financial condition. Most 
firms also have financial statements prepared semiannually, quarterly, or monthly. 
The Balance Sheet
Question: Where could you find the total amount of assets, liabilities, and owners’ 
equity for Hershey Foods Corporation?
Answer: The firm’s balance sheet.
A balance sheet (sometimes referred to as a statement of financial position) is 
a summary of the dollar amounts of a firm’s assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity 
accounts at the end of a specific accounting period. The balance sheet must demonstrate 
that assets are equal to liabilities plus owners’ equity. Most people think of a balance

sheet as a statement that reports the financial condition of a business firm such as 
the Hershey Foods Corporation, but balance sheets apply to individuals, too. For 
example, Marty Campbell graduated from college three years ago and obtained a 
position as a sales representative for an office supply firm. After going to work, he 
established a checking and savings account and purchased an automobile, stereo, 
television, and a few pieces of furniture. Marty paid cash for some purchases, but he 
had to borrow money to pay for the larger ones. Figure 17.5 shows Marty’s current 
personal balance sheet.
Marty Campbell’s assets total $26,500, and his liabilities amount to $10,000. Although 
the difference between total assets and total liabilities is referred to as owners’ equity 
or stockholders’ equity for a business, it is normally called net worth 
for an individual. As reported on Marty’s personal balance sheet, net 
worth is $16,500. The total assets ($26,500) and the total liabilities 
plus net worth ($26,500) are equal. Thus, the accounting equation 
(Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ equity) is still in balance.
Figure 17.6 shows the balance sheet for Northeast Art Supply, 
a small corporation that sells picture frames, paints, canvases, and 
other artists’ supplies to retailers in New England. Note that assets 
are reported on the left side of the statement, and liabilities and stock-
holders’ equity are reported on the right side. Let’s work through the 
different accounts in Figure 17.6.
Assets
On a balance sheet, assets are listed in order from the most liquid 
to the least liquid. The liquidity of an asset is the ease with which 
it can be converted into cash.
Current Assets  Current assets are assets that can be converted 
quickly into cash or that will be used in one year or less. Because 
cash is the most liquid asset, it is listed first. Next are marketable 
securities—stocks, bonds, and other investments—that can be con-
verted into cash in a matter of days.
Often individuals determine their net worth, or owners’ equity, by subtracting the value of their liabilities  
from the value of their assets.

Checking it once, checking it twice. . . . Before 
determining the total value of a firm’s assets, 
accountants must determine the value of each type 
of inventory a firm has on hand to meet customer 
demand. Accurate accounting procedures for inventory 
can also determine when it is time to order more

held or used for a period longer 
than one year
Next are the firm’s receivables. Its accounts receivable, which result from allow-
ing customers to make credit purchases, generally are paid within 30 to 60 days. 
However, the firm expects that some of these debts will not be collected. Thus, it has 
reduced its accounts receivables by a 5 percent allowance for doubtful accounts. The 
firm’s notes receivable are receivables for which customers have signed promissory 
notes. They generally are repaid over a longer period of time than the firm’s accounts 
receivable.
Northeast’s merchandise inventory represents the value of goods on hand for sale to 
customers. Since Northeast Art Supply is a wholesale operation, the inventory listed in 
Figure 17.6 represents finished goods ready for sale to retailers. For a manufacturing firm, 
merchandise inventory also may represent raw materials that will become part of a finished 
product or work that has been partially completed but requires further processing.
Northeast Art’s last current asset is prepaid expenses, which are assets that have 
been paid for in advance but have not yet been used. An example is insurance premi-
ums. They are usually paid at the beginning of the policy year. The unused portion (say, 
for the last four months of the time period covered by the policy) is a prepaid expense. 
For Northeast Art, all current assets total $182,000.
Fixed Assets  Fixed assets are assets that will be held or used for a period longer 
than one year. They generally include land, buildings, and equipment used in the con-
tinuing operation of the business. Although Northeast Art owns no land or buildings, 
it does own delivery equipment that originally cost $110,000. It also owns furniture 
and store equipment that originally cost $62,000.
A balance sheet (sometimes referred to as a statement of financial position) summarizes a firm’s accounts at the end 
of an accounting period, showing the various dollar amounts that enter into the accounting equation. Note that assets 
($340,000) equal liabilities plus owners’ equity ($340,000) and the accounting equation is still in balance.

depreciation  the process of 
apportioning the cost of a fixed 
asset over the period during which 
it will be used
intangible assets  assets that do 
not exist physically but that have

privileges they confer on a firm
current liabilities  debts that will

Note that the values of both fixed assets are decreased 
by their accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is the 
process of apportioning the cost of a fixed asset over 
the period during which it will be used, that is, its useful 
life. The depreciation amount allotted to each year is an 
expense for that year, and the value of the asset must be 
reduced by the amount of depreciation expense. In the 
case of Northeast’s delivery equipment, $20,000 of its 
value has been depreciated (or used up) since it was pur-
chased. Its value at this time is thus $110,000 less $20,000, 
or $90,000. In a similar fashion, the original value of furniture 
and store equipment ($62,000) has been reduced by deprecia-
tion totaling $15,000. Furniture and store equipment now has 
a reported value of $47,000. For Northeast Art, all fixed assets 
total $137,000.
Intangible Assets  Intangible assets are assets that do not 
exist physically but that have a value based on the rights or 
privileges they confer on a firm. They include patents, copy-
rights, trademarks, and goodwill. By their nature, intangible 
assets are long-term assets—they are of value to the firm for a 
number of years.
Northeast Art Supply lists a patent for a special oil paint 
that the company purchased from the inventor. The firm’s 
accountants estimate that the patent has a current market value 
of $21,000. The firm’s intangible assets total $21,000. Now it 
is possible to total all three types of assets for Northeast Art. As 
calculated in Figure 17.6, total assets are $340,000.
Liabilities and Owners’ Equity
The liabilities and the owners’ equity accounts complete the balance sheet. The firm’s 
liabilities are separated into two categories—current and long-term liabilities.
Current Liabilities  A firm’s current liabilities are debts that will be repaid in one 
year or less. Northeast Art Supply purchased merchandise from its suppliers on credit. 
Thus, its balance sheet includes an entry for accounts payable. Accounts payable are 
short-term obligations that arise as a result of a firm making credit purchases.
Notes payable are obligations that have been secured with promissory notes. They 
are usually short-term obligations, but they may extend beyond one year. Only those 
that must be paid within the year are listed under current liabilities.
Northeast Art also lists salaries payable and taxes payable as current liabilities. 
These are both expenses that have been incurred during the current accounting period 
but will be paid in the next accounting period. For Northeast Art, current liabilities 
total $70,000.
Long-Term Liabilities  Long-term liabilities are debts that need not be repaid for 
at least one year. Northeast lists only one long-term liability—a $40,000 mortgage pay-
able for store equipment. As you can see in Figure 17.6, Northeast Art’s current and 
long-term liabilities total $110,000.
Owners’ or Stockholders’ Equity  For a sole proprietorship or partnership, the own-
ers’ equity is shown as the difference between assets and liabilities. In a partnership, 
each partner’s share of the ownership is reported separately in each owner’s name. For 
a corporation, the owners’ equity usually is referred to as stockholders’ equity. The

of a firm’s revenues and expenses 
during a specified accounting 
period
dollar amount reported on the balance sheet is the total value of stock plus retained 
earnings that have accumulated to date. Retained earnings are the portion of a busi-
ness’s profits not distributed to stockholders.
The original investment by the owners of Northeast Art Supply was $150,000 
and was obtained by selling 25,000 shares at $6 per share. In addition, $80,000 of 
Northeast Art’s earnings has been reinvested in the business since it was founded. Thus, 
owners’ equity totals $230,000.
As the two grand totals in Figure 17.6 show, Northeast Art’s assets and the sum 
of its liabilities and owners’ equity are equal—at $340,000. The accounting equation 
(Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ equity) is still in balance.
The Income Statement
Question: Where can you find the profit or loss amount for Apple, Inc.?
Answer: The firm’s income statement.
An income statement is a summary of a firm’s revenues and expenses during a 
specified accounting period—one month, three months, six months, or a year. The 
income statement is sometimes called the earnings statement or the statement of 
income and expenses. Let’s begin our discussion by constructing a personal income 
statement for Marty Campbell. Having worked as a sales representative for an office 
supply firm for the past three years, Marty now earns $33,600 a year, or $2,800 
a month. After deductions, his take-home pay is $1,900 a month. As illustrated in 
Figure 17.7, Marty’s typical monthly expenses include payments for an automobile

Although the difference between income and expenses is referred to as profit or 
loss for a business, it is normally referred to as a cash surplus or cash deficit for an 
individual. Fortunately for Marty, he has a surplus of $250 at the end of each month. 
He can use this surplus for savings, investing, or paying off debts. It is also possible to 
use the information from a personal income statement to construct a personal budget. 
A personal budget is a specific plan for spending your income—over the next month, 
for example. 
Figure 17.8 shows the income statement for Northeast Art Supply. For a business, 
revenues less cost of goods sold less operating expenses equals net income.
Revenues
Revenues are the dollar amounts earned by a firm from selling goods, providing 
services, or performing business activities. Like most businesses, Northeast Art Supply 
obtains its revenues solely from the sale of its products or services. The revenues section 
of its income statement begins with gross sales. Gross sales are the total dollar amount 
An income statement summarizes a firm’s revenues and expenses during a 
specified accounting period. For Northeast Art Supply, net income after  
taxes is $30,175.

of all goods and services sold during the accounting period. Deductions made from 
this amount are
●
●sales returns—merchandise returned to the firm by its customers;
●
●sales allowances—price reductions offered to customers who accept slightly dam-
aged or soiled merchandise; and
●
●sales discounts—price reductions offered to customers who pay their bills promptly.
The remainder is the firm’s net sales. Net sales are the actual dollar amounts 
received by the firm for the goods and services it has sold after adjustment for returns, 
allowances, and discounts. For Northeast Art, net sales are $451,000.
Cost of Goods Sold
The standard method of determining the cost of goods sold by a retailing or a 
wholesaling firm can be summarized as follows:
Cost of goods sold = Beginning inventory + Net purchases – Ending inventory
According to Figure 17.8, Northeast Art Supply began its accounting period on 
January 1 with a merchandise inventory that cost $40,000. During the next 12 months, 
the firm purchased merchandise valued at $346,000. After deducting purchase discounts, 
however, it paid only $335,000 for this merchandise. Thus, during the year, Northeast had 
total goods available for sale valued at $40,000 plus $335,000, for a total of $375,000.
Twelve months later, at the end of the accounting period on December 31, Northeast 
had sold all but $41,000 worth of the available goods. The cost of goods sold by 
Northeast was therefore $375,000 less ending inventory of $41,000, or $334,000. It is 
now possible to calculate gross profit. A firm’s gross profit is its net sales less the cost 
of goods sold. For Northeast Art Supply, gross profit was $117,000.
Operating Expenses
A firm’s operating expenses are all business costs other than the cost of goods sold. 
Total operating expenses generally are divided into two categories: selling expenses or 
general expenses.
Selling expenses are costs related to the firm’s marketing activi-
ties. For Northeast Art Supply, selling expenses total $37,000. General 
expenses are costs incurred in managing a business, in this case, a 
total of $42,500. Now it is possible to total both selling and gen-
eral expenses. As Figure 17.8 shows, total operating expenses for the 
accounting period are $79,500.
Net Income
When revenues exceed expenses, the difference is called net income. 
When expenses exceed revenues, the difference is called net loss. 
As Figure 17.8 shows, Northeast Art’s net income from operations 
is computed as gross profit ($117,000) less total operating  
expenses ($79,500). For Northeast Art, net income from operations 
is $37,500. From this amount, interest expense of $2,000 is 
deducted to obtain a net income before taxes of $35,500. The 
interest expense is deducted in this section of the income statement 
because it is not an operating expense. Rather, it is an expense that 
results from financing the business.
Northeast Art’s federal income taxes are $5,325. Although these 
taxes may or may not be payable immediately, they are definitely an 
expense that must be deducted from income. This leaves Northeast Art 
with a net income after taxes of $30,175. This amount may be used to 
pay a dividend to stockholders, it may be retained or reinvested in the 
firm, it may be used to reduce the firm’s debts, or all three.

statement of cash flows  a 
statement that illustrates how the 
company’s operating, investing, 
and financing activities affect cash 
during an accounting period
The Statement of Cash Flows
Cash is vital to any business. In 1987, the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board required all publicly traded companies to include a statement of cash flows, along 
with their balance sheet and income statement, in their annual report. The statement of 
cash flows illustrates how the company’s operating, investing, and financing activities 
affect cash during an accounting period. Whereas a firm’s balance sheet reports dollar 
values for assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity and an income statement reports the firm’s 
dollar amount of profit or loss, the statement of cash flows focuses on how much cash is 
on hand to pay the firm’s bills. Executives and managers can also use the information on a 
firm’s statement of cash flows to determine how much cash is available to pay dividends to 
stockholders. Finally, the information on the statement of cash flows can be used to evaluate 
decisions related to a firm’s future investments and financing needs. Outside stakeholders 
including investors, lenders, and suppliers are also interested in a firm’s statement of cash 
flows. Investors want to know if a firm can pay dividends in the future. Before extending 
credit to a firm, lenders and suppliers often use the information on the statement of cash 
flows to evaluate the firm’s ability to repay its debts.
A statement of cash flows for Northeast Art Supply is illustrated in Figure 17.9. It 
provides information concerning the company’s cash receipts and cash payments and 
is organized around three different activities: operating, investing, and financing.
●
●Cash flows from operating activities. This is the first section of a statement of 
cash flows. It addresses the firm’s primary revenue source—providing goods and 
services. Typical adjustments include adding the amount of depreciation to a firm’s 
net income. Other adjustments for increase or decrease in amounts for accounts 
receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and income taxes payable are also required 
to reflect a true picture of cash flows from operating activities.
●
●Cash flows from investing activities. The second section of the statement is con-
cerned with cash flow from investments. This includes the purchase and sale of 
land, equipment, and other assets and investments.
●
●Cash flows from financing activities. The third and final section deals with the cash 
flow from all financing activities. It reports changes in debt obligation and owners’

Accounting for First-Time Entrepreneurs
Entrepreneurial
Success
How can a firm be profitable but have no 
cash? The founder of a small soap-making 
supply firm was spending money to develop 
profitable new products more quickly than she 
was generating cash from sales. She needed to focus on her 
statement of cash flows and on her cost of goods sold. She did, 
and within a few years, she had built the company into a 
million-dollar business. Entrepreneurs in her situation need to 
control expenses and have sufficient cash flow to get through 
occasional unprofitable periods. 
What about being so busy selling to new customers that 
the firm doesn’t do much to collect on outstanding invoices? 
A partner in a commercial tile company was pleased that 
he had more than $100,000 in accounts receivable—until 
he learned that some unpaid bills were so old that those 
customers had gone out of business. Now he pays more 
attention to his accounts receivables, and he doesn’t sell to 
customers until they settle their outstanding balances. Some 
experts advise entrepreneurs to collect receivables within 30 
days of making the sale. 
Finally, record revenues at the proper time. One entrepreneur 
booked revenues in December when customers left deposits 
for custom-made furniture. Because he didn’t deliver the 
items until January, the full sales should have been recorded 
in that month. Correcting this changed his firm’s revenues and 
profitability for both years.

equity accounts. This includes loans and repayments, the sale and repurchase of 
the company’s own stock, and cash dividends.
The totals of all three activities are added to the beginning cash balance to deter-
mine the ending cash balance. For Northeast Art Supply, the ending cash balance is 
$59,000. Note that this is the same amount reported for the cash account on the firm’s 
balance sheet. Together, the statement of cash flows, balance sheet, and income state-
ment illustrate the results of past business decisions and reflect the firm’s ability to pay 
debts and dividends and to finance new growth.
Evaluating Financial Statements
All three financial statements—the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement 
of cash flows—can provide answers to a variety of questions about a firm’s ability to do 
business and stay in business, its profitability, and its value as an investment. Often the 
first step is to compare a firm’s financial data with other firms in similar industries and 
with its own financial results over recent accounting periods.
Comparing Financial Data 
Many firms compare their financial results with those of competing firms, with 
industry averages, and with their own financial results. Comparisons are possible

A statement of cash flows summarizes how a firm’s operating, investing, and 
financing activities affect its cash during a specified period—one month, three 
months, six months, or a year. For Northeast Art Supply, the amount of cash at 
the end of the year reported on the statement of cash flows is $59,000—the same 
amount reported for the cash account on the firm’s balance sheet.

as long as accountants follow GAAPs. Except for minor differences in format and 
terms, the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows of Procter 
& Gamble, for example, will be similar to those of other large corporations, 
such as Nestle, Clorox, Colgate-Palmolive, and Unilever, in the consumer goods 
industry. Comparisons among firms give managers a general idea of a firm’s relative 
effectiveness and its standing within the industry. Competitors’ financial statements 
can be obtained from their annual reports—if they are public corporations. Industry 
averages are published by reporting services such as D&B (formerly Dun & Bradstreet) 
and Standard & Poor’s, as well as by some industry trade associations. Today, most 
corporations include in their annual reports comparisons of the important elements of their 
financial statements for recent years. For example, Figure 17.10 shows such comparisons—
of revenue, research and development (R&D), operating income, and sales and marketing 
expenses—for Microsoft Corporation, a world leader in the computer software industry. 
By examining these data, an operating manager can tell whether R&D expenditures have 
been increasing or decreasing over the past three years. The vice president of marketing can 
determine if the total amount of sales and marketing expenses is changing. Stockholders and 
potential investors, on the other hand, may be more concerned with increases or decreases 
in Microsoft’s revenues and operating income over the same time period. Still another

type of analysis of a firm’s financial health involves computation of 
financial ratios.
Financial Ratios 
A financial ratio is a number that shows the relationship between 
two elements of a firm’s financial statements. While it is possible 
to calculate many different financial ratios, we’ll only discuss three 
different ratios that are used to measure a firm’s profitability, its 
ability to pay its debts, and how often it sells its inventory. Like 
the individual elements in financial statements, these ratios can be 
compared with those of competitors, with industry averages, and 
with the firm’s past ratios from previous accounting periods. The 
information required to form these ratios is found in a firm’s balance 
sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows (in our examples 
for Northeast Art Supply, Figures 17.6, 17.8, and 17.9).
Measuring a Firm’s Ability to Earn Profits  A firm’s net income 
after taxes indicates whether the firm is profitable. It does not, how-
ever, indicate how effectively the firm’s resources are being used. For 
this latter purpose, a return on sales ratio can be computed. Return on 
sales (or profit margin) is a financial ratio calculated by dividing net 
income after taxes by net sales. For Northeast Art Supply,
The return on sales indicates how effectively the firm is transforming sales into 
profits. A higher return on sales is better than a low one. Today, the average return on 
sales for all business firms is between 4 and 5 percent. With a return on sales of 6.7 
percent, Northeast Art Supply is above average.  A low return on sales can be increased 
by reducing expenses, increasing sales, or both.
Measuring a Firm’s Ability to Pay Its Debts  A current ratio can be used to 
evaluate a firm’s ability to pay its current liabilities. A firm’s current ratio is computed 
by dividing current assets by current liabilities. For Northeast Art Supply,
Current ratio 5   current assets   5 $182,000  5 2.6
	
current liabilities	    $70,000
This means that Northeast Art Supply has $2.60 of current assets for every $1 of 
current liabilities. The average current ratio for all industries is 2.0, but it varies greatly 
from industry to industry. A high current ratio indicates that a firm can pay its cur-
rent liabilities. A low current ratio can be improved by repaying current liabilities, by 
reducing dividend payments to stockholders to increase the firm’s cash balance, or by 
obtaining additional cash from investors.
Measuring How Well a Firm Manages Its Inventory  A firm’s inventory turnover 
is the number of times the firm sells its merchandise inventory in one year. It is approxi-
mated by dividing the cost of goods sold in one year by the average value of the inventory.
The average value of the inventory can be found by adding the beginning inventory 
value and the ending inventory value (given on the income statement) and dividing the 
sum by 2. For Northeast Art Supply, average inventory is $40,500. Thus

The next step: Going beyond a firm’s financial 
statements. Often accountants must calculate 
financial ratios to determine the financial “health” of 
a firm. Among the most useful (and informative) are 
ratios that measure a firm’s profitability, its ability to 
pay its debts, and how well it manages its inventory 
and receivables.

Northeast Art Supply sells its merchandise inventory 8.2 times each year, or about 
once every 45 days. The average inventory turnover for all firms is about 9 times per 
year, but turnover rates vary widely from industry to industry. For example, supermar-
kets may have inventory turnover rates of 20 or higher, whereas inventory turnover 
rates for furniture stores are generally well below the national average. The quickest 
way to improve inventory turnover is to order merchandise in smaller quantities at 
more frequent intervals.
Like the three ratios described in this section, the calculations for other financial 
ratios, including return on owners’ ratio, earnings per share, working capital, and debt-
to-equity, are based on the information contained in a firm’s balance sheet, income 
statement, and statement of cash flows. For more detailed information on ratio analy-
sis, you may want to read more on the topic in an accounting or finance textbook or 
use an Internet search engine. 
This chapter ends our discussion of management and accounting information. 
In Chapter 18, we begin our examination of business finances by discussing money, 
banking, and credit.

The 21st-century PwC is nothing like the small account-
ing practice that Samuel Lowell Price set up in London 
during the mid-19th century. Relying on the knowledge 
and experience of its global workforce, PwC offers a wide 
variety of auditing, accounting, and tax services. Its indus-
try specialists also provide expert advice and guidance to 
banks, law firms, retailers, hospitals, energy firms, travel 
companies, and many other types of companies, as well as 
educational institutions, government agencies, and non-
profit groups.
PwC has some very glamorous clients, although its 
role is behind the scenes rather than on the red car-
pet. For example, PwC collects and counts the votes 
for the Academy Awards. Thanks to the firm’s extreme 
­measures to ensure secrecy, nobody knows who won 
until the famous presenters step into the spotlight and 
make their announcements to the world.
Questions
1.	 When an accounting firm like PwC has been hired 
to examine and sign off on a public corporation’s 
annual report, should it limit its consulting work to 
avoid being influenced by financial ties to the client? 
Explain your answer.
2.	 Why would the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences hire PwC instead of having its own employ-
ees count votes for the Academy Awards?

Examine how information can reduce risk when 
making a decision.
The more information a manager has, the less risk there 
is that a decision will be incorrect. Information produces 
knowledge and empowers managers and employees to make 
better decisions. Because of the volume of information they 
receive each day and their need to make decisions on a 
daily basis, businesspeople use information rules to shorten 
the time spent analyzing choices. Information rules emerge 
when business research confirms the same results each 
time it studies the same or a similar set of circumstances. 
Although many people use the terms data and information 
interchangeably, there is a difference. Data are numerical 
or verbal descriptions that usually result from some sort 
of measurement. Information is data presented in a form

that is useful for a specific purpose. A database is a single 
collection of data and information stored in one place that 
can be used by people throughout an organization to make 
decisions. Although databases are important, the way the 
data and information are used is even more important. As 
a result, management information experts now use the term 
knowledge management (KM) to describe a firm’s procedures 
for generating, using, and sharing the data and information.
Discuss management’s information requirements.
A management information system (MIS) is a means of 
providing managers with the information they need to 
perform their jobs as effectively as possible. The purpose of 
an MIS (sometimes referred to as an information technology 
system or simply IT system) is to distribute timely and useful 
information from both internal and external sources to the 
decision makers who need it. The specific types of information 
managers need depend on their area of management and level 
within the firm. The size and complexity of an MIS must be 
tailored to the information needs of the organization it serves.
Outline the five functions of an information 
system.
The five functions performed by an MIS system are 
collecting data, storing data, updating data, processing data 
into information, and presenting information. Data may be 
collected from such internal sources as company records, 
reports, and minutes of meetings, as well as from the firm’s 
managers and employees. External sources include customers, 
suppliers, financial institutions and banks, trade and business 
publications, industry conferences, online computer services, 
and information-gathering organizations. An MIS must be 
able to store data until they are needed and to update them 
regularly to ensure that the information presented to managers 
and employees is accurate, complete, and timely. Data 
processing is the MIS function that transforms stored data 
into a form useful for a specific purpose. Finally, the processed 
data (which now can be called information) must be presented 
for use. Verbal information generally is presented in the form 
of a report. Numerical information most often is displayed in 
graphs, charts, or tables. In addition to the five basic functions 
performed by an MIS, managers and employees can use a 
decision-support system, an executive information system, and 
expert system to help improve the decision-making process. 
Explain why accurate accounting information and 
audited financial statements are important.
Accounting is the process of systematically collecting, 
analyzing, and reporting financial information. It can be used 
to answer questions about what has happened in the past; it 
also can be used to help make decisions about the future. In 
fact, the firm’s accountants and its accounting system often 
translate goals, objectives, and plans into dollars and cents to 
help determine if a decision or plan of action makes “financial 
sense.” The purpose of an audit is to make sure that a firm’s 
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. To help ensure that 
2

corporate financial information is accurate and in response to 
the accounting scandals that surfaced in the last few years, the 
Sarbanes–Oxley Act was signed into law. This law contains a 
number of provisions designed to restore public confidence in 
the accounting industry.
Read and interpret a balance sheet.
A balance sheet (sometimes referred to as a statement of 
financial position) is a summary of a firm’s assets, liabilities, 
and owners’ equity accounts at the end of an accounting 
period. This statement must demonstrate that the accounting 
equation is in balance. On the balance sheet, assets are 
categorized as current, fixed, or intangible. Similarly, liabilities 
can be divided into current liabilities and long-term liabilities. 
For a sole proprietorship or partnership, owners’ equity is 
shown as the difference between assets and liabilities. For 
corporations, the owners’ equity section reports the values of 
stock and retained earnings.
Read and interpret an income statement.
An income statement is a summary of a firm’s financial 
operations during the specified accounting period. On the 
income statement, the company’s gross profit is computed by 
subtracting the cost of goods sold from net sales. Operating 
expenses and interest expense then are deducted to compute 
net income before taxes. Finally, income taxes are deducted 
to obtain the firm’s net income after taxes.
Describe business activities that affect a firm’s 
cash flow.
Since 1987, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
and the Financial Accounting Standards Board have required 
all publicly traded companies to include a statement of cash 
flows in their annual reports. This statement illustrates how the 
company’s operating, investing, and financing activities affect 
cash during an accounting period. Together, the cash flow 
statement, balance sheet, and income statement illustrate the 
results of past decisions and the business’s ability to pay debts 
and dividends as well as to finance new growth.
Summarize how managers evaluate the financial 
health of a business.
The firm’s financial statements and its accounting information 
become more meaningful when compared with information for 
competitors, for the industry in which the firm operates, and 
corresponding information for previous years. Such comparisons 
permit managers, employees, lenders, investors, and other 
interested people to pick out trends in growth, borrowing, 
income, and other business variables and to determine whether 
the firm is on the way to accomplishing its long-term goals. A 
number of financial ratios can be computed from the information 
in a firm’s financial statements. These ratios provide a picture of 
a firm’s profitability, its ability to pay its debts, and how often 
it sells its inventory. Like the information on the firm’s financial 
statements, these ratios can and should be compared with 
information for competitors, for the industry in which the firm 
operates, and corresponding information for previous years.

Part 6   Social Media, e-Business, and Accounting
As the “leading supplier of exclusive, high-end audio and video 
electronics for homes, businesses, educational institutions, and 
other organizations in greater Chicagoland,” The Little Guys has 
built an enviable reputation since its founding in 1994. The Little 
Guys sells and installs top-brand home audio and theater equip-
ment and does it well. The company prides itself on its highly 
knowledgeable salespeople and outstanding customer service, 
and these have helped it survive strong competition from both 
“big guys” like the Best Buy electronics chain, which has a store 
not far away, and economic downturns that have cut consumers’ 
buying power. “We have the best employees,” says the company’s 
Web site, and “how we treat our customers makes us great.”
David Wexler, the store’s co-owner, describes how one of the 
firm’s award-winning salespeople deals with his customers, for 
instance: “If a guy comes in to buy a $50 DVD player, Ed treats 
him the same as the guy who’s spending $500,000 with us. I think 
that’s what keeps people coming back over and over and over. He 
fights for them. Frankly, sometimes he fights too much for them. 
But he’s their advocate, and they know it.”
In response to recession-slowed sales, the company was 
recently forced to lay some people off and has reorganized 
departments from advertising to payroll (the latter is a major 
and complex expense for The Little Guys because its salespeople 
earn base pay plus a percentage of their sales). In another cost-
cutting move, the company also recently moved to a new location 
not far from its original store, and it’s keeping close track of its 
cash flows in and out. Salespeople are careful about customers’ 
change orders, too, which often cost the company money.  Now, 
as the economy begins to improve and consumers begin to spend 
more on electronics, these same cost-cutting measures will help 
improve the firm’s bottom-line profit amount.
With the help of QuickBooks accounting software and a 
professional accountant who visits regularly, David Wexler and 
co-owner Evie Wexler have deepened their knowledge of account-
ing and finance as the business has grown. In the beginning, for 
instance, they checked sales figures every day, but David quickly 
realized that this practice created instant information overload. 
Now he looks at the numbers about every week or ten days, com-
paring each set with past results, and the accountant comes in 
at least once each quarter to help with more complex issues like 
depreciation of assets and equipment for tax purposes. Taxes are 
a big concern. As Evie Wexler points out, sometimes the firm has 
to make a special push to sell off inventory in order to generate 
extra cash flow when taxes are due, or when it wants to pur-
chase new merchandise that customers are asking for and that 
will therefore sell faster. Keeping warehoused inventory low saves 
money, too.
One reason cash flow can be slow is that customers often 
negotiate prices and repayment terms at The Little Guys, so 
that an expensive system might not only be sold at a discount, 
but the customer may also be given extra time to pay. That 
certainly helps make customers happy, but if it means the com-
pany is paying its own suppliers on time while customers lag 
in their payments, cash can get tight. As David explains, that’s 
partly why The Little Guys limits the number of brands it sells 
and works with only a few suppliers. Establishing good rela-
tionships with these suppliers, largely by ordering regularly and 
paying on time, allows the company to ask them for special dis-
counts or improved payment terms—even when other retailers 
aren’t getting them—and find yet another way to earn a little 
more profit on the same volume of sales.6
Questions
1.	 Do you think a fairly small company like The Little Guys still 
needs a professional accountant after its owners have had so 
much experience running a successful business? Why or why 
not?
2.	 Do you think The Little Guys is doing a good job of using 
information to manage the business? If so, why, and if not, 
how can the company improve this function?
3.	 What are some of the factors that contribute to The Little 
Guys’ cash-flow problems? How might the owners better 
manage its cash flow?

Will sales and profits meet the expectations of investors and Wall 
Street analysts? Managers at public corporations must answer 
this important question quarter after quarter, year after year. In 
an ideal world—one in which there is never an economic crisis, 
expenses never go up, and customers never buy competing prod-
ucts—the corporation’s price for a share of its stock would soar, 
and investors would cheer as every financial report showed ever-
higher sales revenues, profit margins, and earnings.
In the real world, however, many uncontrollable and unpre-
dictable factors can affect a corporation’s performance. 
Customers may buy fewer units or postpone purchases, competi-
tors may introduce superior products, expenses may rise, interest 
rates may climb, and buying power may plummet. Faced with 
the prospect of releasing financial results that fall short of Wall 
Street’s expectations, managers may feel intense pressure to 
“make the numbers” using a variety of accounting techniques.

For example, some executives at the telecom company 
WorldCom made earnings look better by booking billions of dol-
lars in ordinary expenses as capital investments. The company 
was forced into bankruptcy a few weeks after the $11 billion 
accounting scam was exposed. As another example, top manag-
ers at the drug retailer Rite Aid posted transactions improperly to 
inflate corporate earnings. Later, when Rite Aid had to lower its 
earnings by $1.6 billion, investors fled and the share price fell.
Under the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, the CEO and CFO now must 
certify the corporation’s financial reports. (For more information 
about Sarbanes–Oxley, visit www.aicpa.org, the Web site of the 
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.) Immediately 
after this legislation became effective, hundreds of companies 
restated their earnings, a sign that stricter accounting controls were 
having the intended effect. “I don’t mean to sugarcoat the figure 
on restatements,” says Steve Odland, the former CEO of Office 
Depot, “but I think it is positive—it shows a healthy system.” Yet 
not all earnings restatements are due to accounting irregularities. 
“The general impression of the public is that accounting rules are 
black and white,” he adds. “They are often anything but that, and 
in many instances the changes in earnings came after new interpre-
tations by the chief accountant of the SEC.”
Now that stricter regulation has been in force for some time, 
fewer and fewer corporations are announcing restatements. In 
fact, the number of corporations restating earnings has declined 
since it peaked in 2006. The chief reason for the decline is that 
corporations and their accounting firms have learned to dig 
deeper and analyze the process used to produce the figures for 
financial statements, as well as checking the numbers themselves.
Because accounting rules are open to interpretation, manag-
ers sometimes find themselves facing ethical dilemmas when 
a corporation feels pressure to live up to Wall Street’s expec-
tations. Consider the hypothetical situation at Commodore 
Appliances, a fictional company that sells to Home Depot, 
Lowe’s, and other major retail chains. Margaret, the vice presi-
dent of sales, has told Rob, a district manager, that the compa-
ny’s sales are down 10 percent in the current quarter. She points 
out that sales in Rob’s district are down 20 percent and states 
that higher-level managers want him to improve this month’s 
figures using “book and hold,” which means recording future 
sales transactions in the current period.
Rob hesitates, saying that the company is gaining market share 
and that he needs more time to get sales momentum going. He 
thinks “book and hold” is not a good business practice, even if 
it is legal. Margaret hints that Rob will lose his job if his sales 
figures don’t look better and stresses that he will need the book-
and-hold approach for one month only. Rob realizes that if he 
doesn’t go along, he won’t be working at Commodore for very 
much longer.
Meeting with Kevin, one of Commodore’s auditors, Rob learns 
that book and hold meets GAAPs. Kevin emphasizes that cus-
tomers must be willing to take title to the goods before they’re 
delivered or billed. Any book-and-hold sales must be real, backed 
by documentation such as e-mails to and from buyers, and the 
transactions must be completed in the near future.
Rob is at a crossroads: His sales figures must be higher if 
Commodore is to achieve its performance targets, yet he doesn’t 
know exactly when (or if) he actually would complete any book-
and-hold sales he might report this month. He doesn’t want to 
mislead anyone, but he also doesn’t want to lose his job or put 
other people’s jobs in jeopardy by refusing to do what he is being 
asked to do. Rob is confident that he can improve his district’s 
sales over the long term. However, Commodore’s executives are 
pressuring Rob to make the sales figures look better right now. 
What should he do?7
Questions
1.	 What are the ethical and legal implications of using account-
ing practices such as the book-and-hold technique to inflate 
corporate earnings?
2.	 Why would Commodore’s auditor insist that Rob document 
any sales booked under the book-and-hold technique?
3.	 If you were in Rob’s situation, would you agree to use the 
book-and-hold technique this month? Justify your decision.
4.	 Imagine that Commodore has taken out a multimillion-dollar 
loan that must be repaid next year. How might the lender react 
if it learned that Commodore was using the book-and-hold 
method to make revenues look higher than they really are?
1 	USING SOCIAL MEDIA
The Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates account-
ing practices and has pretty specific rules about endorsements 
and testimonials. Yet, much of the content on social media sites 
deals with both endorsements and testimonials. For example, 
Facebook “likes” can be considered a type of endorsement. 
Recently the SEC weighed in on this. Read a summary of what 
they had to say at www.accountingtoday.com/news/SEC-Social-
Media-Guidelines-61964-1.html.
1.	 What do you think of these rules? Do you agree or disagree? 
Why?
2.	 Can you think of other industries that may have to contend 
with the transparency of social media?

Assignment
1.	 Today, personal finance and accounting software packages 
are used by millions of people. Based on your initial research, 
would you prefer to purchase Quicken software or use a free 
software package available from a bank or financial institu-
tion? Why?
2.	 Why do you think these money-management software pack-
ages have become so popular? Do you think either type of 
software package could help you manage your finances?
3  DEVELOPING CRITICAL-THINKING SKILLS
According to the experts, you must evaluate your existing finan-
cial condition before establishing an investment plan. As pointed 
out in this chapter, a personal balance sheet provides a picture of 
your assets, liabilities, and net worth. A personal income state-
ment will tell you whether you have a cash surplus or cash deficit 
at the end of a specific time period.
Assignment
1.	 Using your own financial information from last month, con-
struct a personal balance sheet and personal income state-
ment.
2.	 Based on the information contained in your personal financial 
statements, answer the following:
a.	 What is your current net worth?
b.	 Do you have a cash surplus or a cash deficit at the end of 
the month?
c.	 What specific steps can you take to improve your financial 
condition?
3.	 Based on your personal financial information, prepare a 
plan for improving your financial condition over the next six 
months.

This has been a bad year for Miami-based Park Avenue Furniture. 
The firm increased sales revenues to $1,400,000, but total 
expenses ballooned to $1,750,000. Although management 
realized that some of the firm’s expenses were out of control, 
including cost of goods sold ($700,000), salaries ($450,000), 
and advertising costs ($140,000), it could not contain expenses. 
As a result, the furniture retailer lost $350,000. To make mat-
ters worse, the retailer applied for a $350,000 loan at Fidelity 
National Bank and was turned down. The bank officer, Mike 
Nettles, said that the firm already had too much debt. At that 
time, liabilities totaled $420,000; owners’ equity was $600,000.
Assignment
1.	 In groups of three or four, analyze the financial condition of 
Park Avenue Furniture.
2.	 Discuss why you think the bank officer turned down Park 
Avenue’s loan request.
3.	 Prepare a detailed plan of action to improve the financial 
health of Park Avenue Furniture over the next 12 months.

line a plan for doing this.
Graeter’s still makes ice cream by hand, just like the founders did 
in 1870. But in every other respect, it’s a very different business 
from the mom-and-pop firm founded by the great-grandparents 
of Richard, Robert, and Chip Graeter. The founders greeted their 
customers in person, mixed and packed every batch of ice cream

how much they had made. 
In contrast, today’s fourth generation of family owners runs

of ice cream every year. Graeter’s now sells premium ice cream 
through supermarkets and grocery stores in 43 states, and 
receives thousands of orders through its Web site every year. It 
would be impossible for the owners to keep this business running 
smoothly—let alone keep up their fast-paced growth strategy—
using only the basic information systems that served Graeter’s 
earlier in its history.
NEW GROWTH, NEW SYSTEMS 
Paul Porcino, a consultant working with the Graeter family, 
observes that small, entrepreneurial firms often have only “a 
very small amount of information, and . . . it hasn’t been pulled 
together in any meaningful way.” In fact, the Graeter’s stores were 
collecting some useful sales data, but “not really enough to run 
the company of the future,” he notes. Therefore, the first step 
in implementing an updated information system was to define 
what Graeter’s executives needed to know to run the business. 
For example, they needed to be able to track unit sales online, in 
each store, and to each wholesale customer, and to measure both 
costs and profitability by product and channel. Without timely, 
accurate, and detailed data, they couldn’t determine how far they 
were progressing toward their goals, nor could they coordinate 
the efforts of every business function for maximum efficiency. 
With the new management information system, Graeter’s 
owners would have “some of the same powerful decision-making 
tools available to managers in much larger companies,” Porcino 
says. “We are going to be . . . bringing in probably a variety of dif-
ferent information systems . . . so we fully have an understanding 
of what we are selling, as well as some other financial systems, 
and probably some human resources information systems.” 
Despite some technical challenges during implementation, 
Graeter’s has already experienced some of the benefits of collect-
ing better information, particularly about store-level sales. When 
management noticed that overall bakery sales weren’t up to par, 
“we had to adjust,” comments Porcino. The remedy was surpris-
ing: “We actually reduced the number of products we were selling 
in the store . . . . It wasn’t very clear exactly how much we were 
selling, but at least [we had] the good-enough gut sense in terms 
of the ones that were not selling, and we . . . adjusted the total 
inventory line.” With the MIS in place, Graeter’s managers have 
the data they need to fine-tune production, inventory, and ship-
ments to meet demand in each channel.
COUNTING ON ACCOUNTING 
Graeter’s controller, David Blink, is responsible for preparing “all 
financial statements, all reports, payroll, [and] any ad hoc reports 
that any of the managers would need. I handle a lot of the report-
ing for the retail side as well as the manufacturing side,” he says. 
Although an outside payroll company actually prints the employ-
ees’ checks, Blink’s department collects and analyzes payroll data 
as input for management decisions. 
Blink and his staff are also in charge of accounts receivable, 
accounts payable, and financial reporting. They check and record 
financial details about revenues and expenses, and then send the 
data to an outside accounting firm, which prepares financial state-
ments for top management use. With these reports in hand, the 
Graeter’s team can make informed decisions about how many 
seasonal employees to hire, which products to keep, how much to 
invest in new equipment, and other issues that arise day by day.
GRAETER’S SOCIAL SIDE
Even a small business can have a big presence in social media. 
Graeter’s has designated an employee to manage all of the 
company’s activities on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. With 
150,000 Facebook “likes,” Graeter’s engages its brand fans in 
conversations about new or favorite flavors, the size of its choco-
late chunks, special celebrations featuring ice cream, and more. 
It posts a new message or photo every few days, and reveals the 
names of mystery flavors on Facebook in advance of other public-
ity. As a result, fans return to its Facebook page often and they 
enjoy commenting on what other customers post, as well. In 
addition, Graeter’s tweets frequently and periodically posts videos 
on its YouTube channel. 
	Graeter’s also monitors mentions of its brand on other social-
media sites. For example, hundreds of consumers have shared 
images of Graeter’s ice cream and its logo on the Pinterest site. 
As other people add their comments and click to “like,” the con-
versation continues and the word of mouth builds more buzz 
for the Graeter’s brand. Similarly, whenever a customer uses 
Foursquare to “check in” at a Graeter’s shop while buying a sun-
dae or another treat, others can see the activity. The social com-
petition aspect of Foursquare encourages others to join the fun 
by vying to become “mayor” of a particular location (such as a 
Graeter’s shop) by gaining the highest number of check-ins during 
the month. No matter who’s the Foursquare mayor, Graeter’s is 
always the brand winner.8
Questions
1.	 Suppose you were writing a social media plan for Graeter’s, 
with two objectives: to improve brand awareness in markets 
where the ice cream is just becoming available and to build 
online orders during holiday periods. What quantitative and 
qualitative measurements would you plan to use to evaluate 
the results of your plan? 
2.	 Graeter’s uses information to track cash, sales revenue, and 
expenses on a daily basis. How does this type of accounting 
system facilitate effective decision-making and discourage 
store-level theft?
3.	 As a small but fast-growing, privately-owned company, 
which of the financial ratios should Graeter’s track especially 
closely? Why?

Now that you have a marketing plan, the next big and important 
step is to prepare a financial plan. One of the biggest mistakes an 
entrepreneur makes when faced with a need for financing is not being 
prepared. Completing this section will show you that if you are pre-
pared and provide accurate and relevant management and account-
ing information, the task may be easier than you think. Chapter 16 
“Exploring Social Media and e-Business” and Chapter 17, “Using 
Management and Accounting Information,” should help you to 
answer the questions in this part of the business plan.
THE INFORMATION AND ACCOUNTING 
PLAN COMPONENT
Information and accounting systems are important if your busi-
ness is to succeed. Your information plan should answer at least 
the following questions.
6.1.	How will you gather information about competitors, their 
products, and the prices that they charge for their products 
and services?
6.2.	Explain how you will develop a management information sys-
tem to collect, store, update, and process data, and present 
information?
6.3.	Will your business have an e-business component? If so, 
explain how you will sell your products or services online.
6.4.	Are there ways that you can use social media to promote 
products and services and reach out to your customers?
6.5.	Who will create and maintain the accounting system that you 
will use to record routine business transactions for your busi-
ness?
6.6.	Will you hire an accountant to prepare financial statements 
for your firm?
THE FINANCIAL PLAN COMPONENT
Your financial plan should answer at least the following ques-
tions about the investment needed, sales and cash-flow forecasts, 
breakeven analysis, and sources of funding.
  6.7.	 What is the actual amount of money you need to open your 
business (start-up budget) and the amount needed to keep it 
open (operating budget)? Prepare a realistic budget.
  6.8.	How much money do you have, and how much money will 
you need to start your business and stay in business?
  6.9.	Prepare a projected income statement by month for the 
first year of operation and by quarter for the second and 
third years.
6.10.	 Prepare projected balance sheets for each of the first three 
years of operation.
6.11.	 Prepare a breakeven analysis. How many units of your prod-
ucts or service will have to be sold to cover your costs?
6.12. 	Reinforce your final projections by comparing them with 
industry averages for your chosen industry.
REVIEW OF BUSINESS PLAN ACTIVITIES
Throughout this project you have been investigating what it takes 
to open and run a business, and now you are finally at the bottom 
line: What is it going to cost to open your business, and how much 
money will you need to keep it running for a year? Before tackling the 
last part of the business plan, review your answers to the questions in 
each part to make sure that all your answers are consistent through-
out the entire business plan. Then write a brief statement that sum-
marizes all the information for this part of the business plan.

How Umpqua Bank Became “The World’s Greatest Bank”
Umpqua Bank, based in Roseburg, Oregon, doesn’t operate traditional bank branches. 
Instead, its 184 “stores” serve as community hubs, “providing banking services plus events 
and amenities to share with our neighbors,” says executive vice-president Lani Hayward. 
Customers meet with bank employees at concierge desks, relax in easy chairs when open-
ing new accounts, and enjoy a free cup of coffee and free Wi-Fi access whenever they stop 
in. Some Umpqua stores offer yoga classes, wine tastings, trivia contests, even conference 
rooms for impromptu business meetings. Customers can also sign up to see the world by 
joining the bank’s travel club. Why all the extras? Because Umpqua wants customers to 
think of it as “the world’s greatest bank,” a good neighbor, and a force for positive change 
in the communities it serves. 
Umpqua began with six employees and a single branch in 1953, growing through a 
combination of new branches, new markets, and bank mergers. Today, the branch system 
stretches through four states, from the Pacific Northwest through Northern California, 
serving customers with a mix of full-service branches, commercial bank offices, residential 
mortgage offices, and ATM-only locations. 
In addition to its unique community store concept, Umpqua has a number of unique 
banking offers. One example is the GreenStreet Lending program, which provides loans 
to homeowners and businesses for installation of solar panels and other “green” building 
improvements. As another example, small businesses can borrow $10,000 to $100,000 
through the MainStreet Lending program, which supplements the bank’s regular business 
lending services. 
Although Umpqua recently celebrated its 60th birthday, it thinks young when it comes 
to banking technology. Through online banking, mobile banking, and other high-tech sys-
tems, the bank can give its customers easy access to their money and information about 
their money at any hour. And as customers’ needs change, Umpqua will be ready with a 
range of financial services for each new stage of their personal and professional lives.1
M
ost people regard a bank like Umpqua Bank—the financial institution pro-
filed in the Inside Business feature for this chapter—as a place to deposit 
or borrow money. When you deposit money in a bank like Umpqua, you 
receive interest. When you borrow money from this bank or any financial institution 
or lender, you must pay interest. You may borrow to buy a home, a car, or some other 
high-cost item. In this case, the resource that will be transformed into money to repay 
the loan is the salary you receive for your labor.
Businesses also transform resources into money. A business firm (even a new one) 
may have a valuable asset in the form of an idea for a product or service. If the firm (or 
its founder) has a good credit history and the idea is a good one, a bank like Umpqua 
or other lenders may lend it the money to develop, produce, and market the product 
or service. The loan—with interest—will be repaid out of future sales revenue. In this 
way, both the firm and the lender will earn a reasonable profit.
In each of these situations, the borrower needs the money now and will have the 
ability to repay it later. Although the decision to borrow money from a bank or other 
financial institution should always be made after careful deliberation, the fact is that 
responsible borrowing enables both individuals and business firms to meet specific 
needs.
FYI
Did You Know?
Founded in 1953, Umpqua has 
grown from one small Oregon 
branch with six employees to 
184 branches with over 2,200 
employees in four states.

Part 7   Finance and Investment
In this chapter, we begin by outlining the functions and characteristics of money 
that make it an acceptable means of payment for products, services, and resources. 
Then we consider the role of the Federal Reserve System in maintaining a healthy 
economy. Next, we describe the banking industry—commercial banks, savings and 
loan associations, credit unions, and other institutions that offer banking services. 
Then we turn our attention to how banking practices meet the needs of customers. We 
also describe the safeguards established by the federal government to protect deposi-
tors against losses. In closing, we examine credit transactions and sources of credit 
information.
What Is Money?
The members of some societies still exchange goods and services through barter, without 
using money. A barter system is a system of exchange in which goods or services are 
traded directly for other goods or services. The trouble with the barter system is that 
the two parties in an exchange must need each other’s products at the same time, and 
the two products must be roughly equal in value. Thus, even very isolated societies 
soon develop some sort of money to eliminate the inconvenience of trading by barter.
Money is anything a society uses to purchase products, services, or resources. 
Historically, different groups of people have used all sorts of objects as money—whales’ 
teeth, stones, beads, copper crosses, clamshells, and gold and silver, for example. Today, 
the most commonly used objects are metal coins and paper bills, which together are 
called currency.
The Functions of Money
Money aids in the exchange of goods, services, and resources. However, this is a rather 
general (and somewhat theoretical) way of stating money’s function. Let’s look instead 
at three specific functions money serves in any society.
Money as a Medium of Exchange  A medium of exchange is anything accepted 
as payment for products, services, and resources. This definition looks very much like 
the definition of money. It is meant to, because the primary function of money is to 
serve as a medium of exchange. The key word here is accepted. 
As long as the owners of products, services, and resources accept 
money in an exchange, it is performing this function. For example, 
if you want to purchase a Hewlett-Packard Photosmart printer that 
is priced at $149 in a Best Buy store, you must give the store the 
correct amount of money. In return, the store gives you the product.
Money as a Measure of Value  A measure of value is a sin-
gle standard or “yardstick” used to assign values to, and compare 
the values of, products, services, and resources. Money serves as a 
measure of value because the prices of all products, services, and 
resources are stated in terms of money. It is thus the “common 
denominator” we use to compare products and decide which we 
will buy.
Money as a Store of Value  Money received by an individual or 
firm need not be used immediately. It may be held and spent later. 
Hence, money serves as a store of value, or a means of retaining 
and accumulating wealth. This function of money comes into play 
whenever we hold onto money—in a pocket, a cookie jar, a savings 
account, or whatever.

It’s all money! Although it’s easy for U.S. citizens to 
think their currency is the only currency in the world, 
there are many different currencies used throughout 
the world. Regardless of what their money looks like, 
people around the world know that their currency must 
serve as a medium of exchange, a measure of value, 
and a store of value.

Value that is stored as money is affected by inflation. Remember from Chapter 1 
that inflation is a general rise in the level of prices. Suppose that you can buy a Bose 
home theater system for $1,000. Your $1,000 has a value equal to the value of that 
home theater system. However, suppose that you wait and do not buy the home 
theater system immediately. If the price goes up to $1,025 in the meantime because 
of inflation, you can no longer buy the same home theater system with your $1,000. 
Your money has lost purchasing power because it is now worth less than the home 
theater system. To determine the effect of inflation on the purchasing power of a 
dollar, economists often refer to a consumer price index such as the one illustrated 
in Figure 18.1. The consumer price index measures the changes in prices of a fixed 
basket of goods purchased by a typical consumer, including food, transportation, 
housing, clothing, medical care, recreation, education, communication, and other 
goods and services. The base amount for the consumer price index is 100 and was 
established by averaging the cost of the items included in the consumer price index 
over a 36-month period from 1982 to 1984. In February 2012, it took approximately 
$228 to purchase the same goods that could have been purchased for $100 in the 
base period 1982 to 1984.
 Inflation causes a loss of money’s stored value. As the consumer price index goes up, the purchasing power of the 
consumer’s dollar goes down.

Part 7   Finance and Investment
Important Characteristics of Money
Money must be easy to use, trusted, and capable of 
performing the three functions just mentioned. To meet 
these requirements, money must possess the following 
five characteristics.
Divisibility  The standard unit of money must be 
divisible into smaller units to accommodate small pur-
chases and large ones. In the United States, our stan-
dard is the dollar, and it is divided into pennies, nickels, 
dimes, quarters, and half-dollars.
Portability  Money must be small enough and light enough 
to be carried easily. For this reason, paper currency is issued in 
larger denominations—5-, 10-, 20-, 50-, and 100-dollar bills.
Stability  Money should retain its value over time. When it 
does not, people tend to lose faith in their money. When money 
becomes extremely unstable, people may turn to other means 
of storing value, such as gold and jewels, works of art, and real 
estate.
Durability  The objects that serve as money should be strong 
enough to last through reasonable use. To increase the life 
expectancy of paper currency, most nations use special paper 
with a high fiber content.
Difficulty of Counterfeiting  If a nation’s currency were 
easy to counterfeit—that is, to imitate or fake—its citizens 
would be uneasy about accepting it as payment. In an attempt 
to make paper currency more difficult to counterfeit, the U.S. 
government periodically redesigns its paper currency and uses watermarks and intri-
cate designs to discourage counterfeiting.
The Supply of Money: M1 and M2
How much money is there in the United States? Before we can answer this question, 
we need to define a couple of concepts. A demand deposit is an amount on deposit 
in a checking account. It is called a demand deposit because it can be claimed 
immediately—that is, on-demand—by presenting a properly made out check, 
withdrawing cash from an automated teller machine (ATM), or transferring money 
between accounts.
A time deposit is an amount on deposit in an interest-bearing savings account 
or certificate of deposit. Financial institutions generally permit immediate withdrawal 
of money from savings accounts. However, they can require advance written notice 
before withdrawal of money from savings accounts or certificates of deposit. The time 
between notice and withdrawal is what leads to the name time deposit. 
There are two main measures of the supply of money: M1 and M2. The M1 sup-
ply of money is a narrow definition and consists only of currency, demand deposits 
and other checkable deposits. The M2 supply of money consists of M1 (currency and 
demand deposits) plus savings accounts, certain money-market securities, and certifi-
cates of deposit (CDs) of less than $100,000. The M2 definition of money is based on 
the assumption that time deposits can be converted to cash for spending. Figure 18.2 
shows the elements of the M1 and M2 supply of money.
Therefore, the answer to our original question is that the amount of money in the 
United States depends very much on how we measure it. Generally, economists, politi-
cians, and bankers tend to focus on M1 or some variation of M1.

Inflation isn’t just an economic indicator—it means that 
you’ll pay more for many goods and services. If you’re 
saving to buy a car or a home, the money you put aside 
won’t go as far when prices are on the rise.

The Federal Reserve System
How do Federal Reserve actions affect me? What is the Federal Reserve System? These 
are both good questions. First, Federal Reserve Board (often referred to as the Fed) 
activities have an impact on the interest rates you pay for loans and credit cards. 
Although many people became aware of the Federal Reserve’s actions during the recent 
economic crisis, the Fed’s lending programs have been used since the early 1900s to 
maintain a healthy economy. Here’s how it works. The Fed lowers the interest rates that 
banks pay to borrow money from the Fed in an effort to shore up a sagging economy. 
When the Fed lowers rates, banks pay less to borrow money from the Fed. In turn, 
they often lower the interest rates they charge for business loans, home mortgages, car 
loans, and even credit cards. Lower rates often provide an incentive for both business 
firms and individuals to buy goods and services, which, in turn, helps to restore the 
economic health of the nation. On the other hand, rate increases are designed to sustain 
economic growth while controlling inflation. When the Fed raises rates, banks must 
pay more to borrow money from the Fed. And the banks, in turn, charge higher rates 
for both consumer and business loans. 
Now let’s answer the second question. The Federal Reserve System is the cen-
tral bank of the United States and is responsible for regulating the banking industry. 
Created by Congress on December 23, 1913, its mission is to maintain an economically 
healthy and financially sound business environment in which banks can operate.
The Federal Reserve System is controlled by its seven-member board of governors, 
who meet in Washington, D.C. Each governor is appointed by the president and con-
firmed by the Senate for a 14-year term. The president also selects the chairman and 
vice chairman of the board from among the board members for four-year terms.
The Federal Reserve System consists of 12 district banks located in major cit-
ies throughout the United States, as well as 24 branch banks (see Figure 18.3). All 
national (federally chartered) banks must be members of the Fed. State banks may 
join if they meet membership requirements. For more information about the Federal 
Reserve System, visit its Web site at www.federalreserve.gov.
Summarize how the Federal 
Reserve System regulates the 
money supply to maintain a 
healthy economy.

Two measures of the money supply are M1, which includes currency and

Economic Crisis and the Fed’s Response
Lately, it seems like the Federal Reserve Board has been in the news more than usual. The 
reason for all the news coverage is quite simple: The Fed was responsible for maintaining 
the health of the U.S. economy during the recent economic crisis. To maintain a healthy 
economy, the Federal Reserve Board took a number of specific steps to minimize the 
effects of the crisis for both business and individuals. Specifically, the Fed2
●
●Provided liquidity. The Fed allowed banks in need of cash to borrow money from 
the Federal Reserve System. If they could not have borrowed money from the Fed, 
banks would have tightened lending requirements or stopped funding loans to 
both businesses and individuals.
●
●Supported troubled financial markets. During the first part of the crisis, inves-
tors feared that many commercial paper issues would become worthless and they 
stopped investing in money-market funds that held commercial paper. Commercial 
paper is a short-term promissory note issued by a large corporation. At the same 
time, many investors were withdrawing money from money-market funds. In order 
to restore the commercial paper market and lower the cost of this type of short-
term financing for businesses, the Federal Reserve provided secured loans to the 
financial institutions that sell this type of investment; as a result, the commercial 
paper market is now functioning well.
The Federal Reserve System consists of 12 district banks and 24 branch banks.

●Supported important financial institutions. The failure of 
investment bank Lehman Brothers and the commercial bank 
Washington Mutual fueled fears that other large financial insti-
tutions could fail. The resulting panic threatened to lead to a 
full-scale “run” on banks and lenders that could have caused 
the entire financial system to break down. To restore faith in 
the system, the Fed agreed to provide non-recourse loans to 
large banks. The ability to borrow money from the Fed and 
other government agencies helped to calm investors and avoid 
an even larger financial meltdown.
●
●Conducted stress tests of major banks. In the spring of 2009, 
the Federal Reserve, along with other federal agencies, con-
ducted an unprecedented review of the financial condition  
of the 19 largest U.S. banks. This “stress” test measured how well 
these banks could weather the economic crisis. Banks that failed 
the test were required to obtain new capital by selling stock or 
bonds or accept federal government funds. Today, the nation’s 
largest banks still must undergo the Fed’s rigorous stress tests to 
determine if they are able to withstand another economic crisis. 
The Fed’s actions did help to restore confidence in the financial 
system, to encourage continued lending, to stabilize an unstable 
economy, and to provide additional time to create a financial rescue 
plan to restore the nation’s economy. At the time of publication, 
although the health of the banking and financial industry has improved, there are 
still concerns about the long-term effects of the Federal Reserve’s actions, what future 
actions may be needed to ensure continued economic growth, and the cost of the Fed’s 
actions. 
The most important function of the Fed is to use monetary policy to regulate 
the nation’s supply of money in such a way as to maintain a healthy economy. In 
Chapter 1, monetary policy was defined as the Federal Reserve’s decisions that deter-
mine the size of the supply of money in the nation and the level of interest rates. The 
goals of monetary policy are continued economic growth, full employment, and stable 
prices. Three methods—controlling bank reserve requirements, regulating the discount 
rate, and running open-market operations—are used to implement the Fed’s monetary 
policy.
Regulation of Reserve Requirements
When money is deposited in a bank, the bank must retain a portion of it to satisfy 
customers who may want to withdraw money from their accounts. The remainder is 
available to fund loans. By law, the Federal Reserve sets the reserve requirement for 
financial institutions. The reserve requirement is the percentage of its deposits a bank 
must retain, either in its own vault or on deposit with its Federal Reserve district bank. 
For example, if a bank has new deposits of $20 million and the reserve requirement is 
10 percent, the bank must retain $2 million. The present reserve requirements range 
from 0 to 10 percent depending on such factors as the type of account and the total 
amount individual banks have on deposit.3
Once reserve requirements are met, banks can use the remaining funds to create 
more money and make more loans through a process called deposit expansion. In the 
preceding example, the bank must retain $2 million in a reserve account. It can use 
the remaining $18 million to fund consumer and business loans. Assume that the bank 
lends all $18 million to different borrowers and also assume that before using any of 
the borrowed funds, all borrowers deposit the $18 million in their bank accounts at the 
lending institution. Now the bank’s deposits have increased by an additional $18 mil-
lion. Because these deposits are subject to the same reserve requirement described ear-
lier, the bank must maintain $1.8 million in a reserve account, and the bank can lend 
the additional $16.2 million to other bank customers. Of course, the bank’s lending 
Is Ben Bernanke the nation’s most important 
banker? If you ask that question to bankers, corporate 
executives, and politicians, the answer would be yes. 
Simply put: When Mr. Bernanke talks, the financial 
world listens. Over the last few years, it has been his 
decisions and the actions taken by the Federal Reserve 
Board that are responsible for reducing the effects of 
the recent economic crisis.

Part 7   Finance and Investment
potential becomes steadily smaller and smaller as it makes more loans. Moreover, we 
should point out that as bankers are usually very conservative by nature; they will not 
use deposit expansion to maximize their lending activities. Instead, they will take a 
more middle-of-the-road approach.
The Fed’s board of governors sets the reserve requirement. When it increases the 
requirement, banks have less money available for lending. Fewer loans are made, and 
the economy tends to slow. On the other hand, by decreasing the reserve requirement, 
the Fed can make additional money available for lending to stimulate a slow economy. 
Although the Fed may change the amount of deposits subject to the reserve require-
ment from year to year, the Fed seldom changes the reserve requirement because this 
means of controlling the money supply is so very potent.
Regulation of the Discount Rate
Member banks may borrow money from the Fed to satisfy the reserve requirement. 
The interest rate the Federal Reserve charges for loans to member banks, called the 
discount rate, is set by the board of directors of each Federal Reserve District bank. 
For the period from January 2003 to June 2006, the discount rate has been as low 
as 2 percent and as high as 6.25 percent.4 In August 2007, in an attempt to stabilize 
the economy and encourage lending, the Federal Reserve began lowering the discount 
rate. By February 2010, the discount rate reached its lowest level and remains at 0.75 
percent at the time of publication.5
When the Fed lowers the discount rate, it is easier and cheaper for banks to obtain 
money. Member banks feel free to make more loans and to charge lower interest rates. 
This action generally stimulates the nation’s economy. When the Fed raises the discount 
rate, banks begin to restrict loans, increase the interest rates they charge for loans, 
and tighten their own loan requirements. The overall effect is to slow the economy. 
Although the discount rate has decreased to 0.75 percent, you should remember that 
the Fed can increase rates in an effort to maintain a healthy economy.
Open-Market Operations
The federal government finances its activities partly by buying and selling government 
securities issued by the U.S. Treasury. These securities, which pay interest, may be 
purchased by any individual, firm, or organization—including the Fed. Open-market 
operations are the buying and selling of U.S. government securities by the Federal 
Reserve System for the purpose of controlling the supply of money.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is charged with carrying out the 
Federal Reserve’s open-market operations by buying and selling U.S. Treasury securi-
ties through the trading desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. To reduce 
the nation’s money supply, the FOMC simply sells government securities. The money 
it receives from purchasers is taken out of circulation. Thus, less money is available 
for investment, purchases, or lending. To increase the money supply, the FOMC buys 
government securities. The money the FOMC pays for securities goes back into circula-
tion, making more money available to individuals and firms.
Because the major purchasers of government securities are banking and financial 
institutions, open-market operations tend to have an immediate effect on lending and 
investment.
Of the three tools used to influence monetary policy, the use of open-market opera-
tions is the most important. When the Federal Reserve buys and sells securities, the 
goal is to change the federal funds rate. The federal funds rate is the interest rate at 
which a bank lends immediately available funds on deposit at the Fed to another bank 
overnight to meet the borrowing bank’s reserve requirements. Because the Fed funds 
rate is what banks pay when they borrow, it affects the rates they charge when they 
lend. Although the FOMC sets a target for the federal funds rate, it does not actually 
set the rate because it is determined by the open market.6 (Note: There is a difference 
between the federal funds rate and the discount rate discussed earlier in this section.

banks. The discount rate is the interest rate paid by a bank to borrow funds from the 
Federal Reserve.) Table 18.1 summarizes the effects of open-market operations and 
the other tools used by the Fed to regulate the money supply and control the economy.
Other Fed Responsibilities
In addition to its regulation of the money supply, the Fed is also responsible for serving 
as the government’s bank, clearing checks and electronic transfers, inspecting currency, 
and applying selective credit controls.
Serving as Government Bank  The Federal Reserve is the bank for the U.S. gov-
ernment. As the government’s bank, it processes a variety of financial transactions 
involving trillions of dollars each year. For example, the Federal Reserve provides 
financial services for the U.S. Treasury, including accounts through which incoming tax 
deposits and outgoing government payments are handled.
Clearing Checks and Electronic Transfers  Although not as popular as they 
once were, many people still use checks to pay their monthly bills and pay for pur-
chases. A check written by a customer of one bank and presented for payment to 
another bank in the same town may be processed through a local clearinghouse. The 
procedure becomes more complicated, however, when the banks are not in the same 
town. Although at one point the Fed was responsible for the prompt and accurate col-
lection of 15 to 17 billion checks each year, today the number of paper checks cleared 
through the Federal Reserve System is decreasing because of improved automation and 
electronic equipment.7 Banks that use the Fed to clear checks are charged a fee for this 
service. Through the use of automation and electronic equipment, most checks can be 
cleared within two or three days.
Inspection of Currency  As paper currency is handled, it becomes worn or dirty. 
The typical $1 bill has a life expectancy of less than two years. Most $50 and $100 bills 
usually last longer because they are handled less. When member banks deposit their 
surplus cash in a Federal Reserve Bank, the currency is inspected. Bills unfit for further 
use are separated and destroyed.
Selective Credit Controls  The Federal Reserve System (along with the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau that was created in 2010) has the responsibility for

­enforcing the Truth-in-Lending Act, which Congress passed in 1968. This act requires 
lenders to state clearly the annual percentage rate and total finance charge for a con-
sumer loan. 
The Federal Reserve System is also responsible for setting the margin require-
ments for securities transactions. The margin is the minimum amount (expressed as 
a percentage) of the purchase price that must be paid in cash or eligible securities. 
(The investor may borrow the remainder.) The current initial margin requirement is 
50 percent. Thus, if an investor purchases $4,000 worth of stock, he or she must pay 
at least $2,000 in cash or its equivalent in securities. The remaining $2,000 may be 
borrowed from the brokerage firm. Although the minimum margin requirements are 
regulated by the Federal Reserve, margin requirements and the interest charged on the 
loans used to fund margin transactions may vary among brokerage firms and different 
security exchanges. 
The American Banking Industry
Most bankers will tell you that the last few years have been frustrating for the 
American banking industry, to say the least. Furthermore, it’s not just bankers who felt 
the impact. Almost everyone has been affected in one way or another by the nation’s 
economic crisis.
Banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, and other financial insti-
tutions were at the center of the nation’s economic problems. Aggressive lending 
practices that led to record numbers of home foreclosures and nonperforming loans 
caused a financial meltdown. As the economic problems within the banking and 
financial industry became larger, the ability to borrow money became more difficult 
for both individuals and business firms—a very serious problem for both borrow-
ers and lenders. In fact, the nation’s economic problems (and the world’s) became 
so severe that the government needed to take action. Both the Bush and the Obama 
administrations developed financial stimulus plans to rescue the economy. In addition, 
both the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Treasury took action. Eventually, the 
rescue plans did help relieve at least some of the financial problems associated with 
the economic crisis. Still, there was need for more changes in the way that banks and 
financial institutions operate.
Banking and Financial Reform: New Regulations
Although there are many critics of increased regulation, it was apparent that something 
needed to be done to prevent the type of economic problems the nation experienced 
during the economic crisis. According to President Barack Obama, the goals of new 
government banking and financial regulations are more than justified in the wake of 
the crisis and include the following:8
●
●Protect American families from unfair and abusive financial and banking practices.
●
●Close the gaps in our financial system that allowed large banks and financial 
firms to avoid strong, comprehensive federal oversight. To accomplish these goals, 
the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was passed 
in 2010. This act addressed many of the issues that led to the economic crisis. 
Specifically, the act
●
●Creates a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
●
●Gives the government the power to seize and close down large failing financial 
firms in an orderly fashion.
●
●Increases government regulation of firms in the financial and banking industry.
●
●Curbs the high-risk investment strategies that led to the financial problems at 
some major financial institutions and the nation’s economic crisis.
●
●Creates a Financial Stability Oversight Council that serves as an early warning 
system of potential risks and problems in the financial system.

To provide this type of comprehensive reform, it will be necessary to 
make sure banks and financial institutions are complying with the 
new regulations. As a result, future regulations will subject banks 
and financial institutions to more in-depth evaluations to determine 
their financial health and to spot signs of trouble before they affect 
individuals, the American economy, and the world economy.
For more information about existing regulations and proposed 
new regulations, go to the Federal Reserve Board’s Web site at www.
federalreserve.gov, the U.S. Treasury Web site at www.ustreas.gov, 
or use a search engine like Google or Yahoo! and enter “banking 
reform” or “financial reform.”
In addition to the nation’s economic problems, competition 
among banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, and 
other business firms that want to perform banking activities has 
never been greater. In fact, many financial institutions are using 
social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, as well as blogs and 
their own Web sites, to attract new customers and retain old ones. 
Let’s begin this section with some information about one of the 
major players in the banking industry—the commercial bank.
Commercial Banks
A commercial bank is a profit-making organization that accepts 
deposits, makes loans, and provides related services to its customers. 
Like other businesses, the bank’s primary goal—its mission—is to 
meet its customers’ needs while earning a profit.
Because they deal with money belonging to individuals and other business firms, 
banks must meet certain requirements before they receive a charter, or permission to 
operate, from either federal or state banking authorities. A national bank is a commer-
cial bank chartered by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency. There are approximately 
1,400 national banks.9 These banks must conform to federal banking regulations and 
are subject to unannounced inspections by federal auditors.
A state bank is a commercial bank chartered by the banking authorities in the 
state in which it operates. State banks outnumber national banks by about four to 
one, but they tend to be smaller than national banks. They are subject to unannounced 
inspections by both state and federal auditors. Table 18.2 lists the seven largest banks 
in the United States. All are classified as national banks.
Other Financial Institutions
In addition to commercial banks, at least eight other types of financial institutions 
perform either full or limited banking services for their customers.
When will the sun begin to shine on American 
banking? Good question. It seems that since the 
economic crisis began in the fall of 2007, banks have 
been at the center of the nation’s economic problems. 
For most banks and many financial institutions, 
aggressive lending practices, record numbers of home 
foreclosures, and a large number of nonperforming 
loans caused a financial meltdown and created a 
situation where it was difficult for both businesses and 
individuals to borrow money.

Part 7   Finance and Investment
Savings and Loan Associations  A savings and loan association (S&L) is a 
financial institution that offers checking and savings accounts and CDs and that invests 
most of its assets in home mortgage loans and other consumer loans. Originally, S&Ls 
were permitted to offer their depositors only savings accounts. However, since Congress 
passed legislation regarding S&Ls in the 1980s, they have been able to offer other ser-
vices to attract depositors.
Today, there are approximately 1,050 S&Ls in the United States insured by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.10 Federal associations are supervised by the 
U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, a branch of the U.S. Treasury. State-chartered S&Ls 
are subjected to unannounced audits by state authorities.
Credit Unions  The United States currently has an estimated 7,300 credit unions.11 A 
credit union is a financial institution that accepts deposits from, and lends money to, 
only those people who are its members. Usually, the membership consists of employees 
of a particular firm, people in a particular profession, or those who live in a community 
served by a local credit union. Credit unions may pay higher interest on deposits than 
commercial banks and S&Ls, and they may provide loans at lower cost. The National 
Credit Union Administration regulates federally chartered credit unions. State authori-
ties regulate credit unions with state charters.
Organizations that Perform Banking Functions  Six other types of financial 
institutions are involved in banking activities. Although not actually full-service banks, 
they offer customers some banking services.
●
●Mutual savings banks are financial institutions that are owned by their depositors 
and offer many of the same services offered by banks, S&Ls, and credit unions, 
including checking accounts, savings accounts, and CDs. Like other financial 
institutions, they also fund home mortgages, commercial loans, and consumer 
loans. Unlike other types of financial institutions, the profits of a mutual savings 
bank go to the depositors, usually in the form of dividends or slightly higher 
interest rates on savings. Today, most mutual savings banks are located in the 
Northeast.
●
●Insurance companies provide long-term financing for office buildings, shopping 
centers, and other commercial real estate projects throughout the United States. 
The funds used for this type of financing are obtained from policyholders’ insur-
ance premiums.
●
●Pension funds are established by employers to guarantee their employees a regular 
monthly income on retirement. Contributions to the fund may come from the 
employer, the employee, or both. Pension funds earn additional income through 
generally conservative investments in corporate stocks, corporate bonds, and gov-
ernment securities, as well as through financing real estate developments.
●
●Brokerage firms offer combination savings and checking accounts that pay higher-
than-usual interest rates. Many people have switched to these accounts because 
they are convenient and to get slightly higher rates.
●
●Finance companies provide financing to individuals and business firms that may 
not be able to get financing from banks, S&Ls, or credit unions. Firms such as Ford 
Motor Credit and GE Capital provide loans to both individuals and business firms. 
Lenders such as Ace Cash Express, Inc., provide short-term loans to individuals. 
The interest rates charged by these lenders may be higher than the interest rates 
charged by other financial institutions.

●Investment banking firms are organizations that assist corporations in raising 
funds, usually by helping sell new issues of stocks, bonds, or other financial secu-
rities. Although these firms do not accept deposits or make loans like traditional 
banking firms, they do help companies raise millions of dollars. More information 
about investment banking firms and the role they play in American business is 
provided in Chapter 19.

Careers in the Banking Industry
Take a second look at Table 18.2. The seven largest banks in the 
United States employ approximately 1,200,000 people. If you add 
to this amount the people employed by smaller banks not listed in 
Table 18.2 and those employed by S&Ls, credit unions, and other 
financial institutions, the number of employees grows dramatically. 
According to the Occupational Outlook Handbook, published by 
the U.S. Department of Labor, a number of different positions in 
the banking industry are projected to have average growth between 
now and the year 2020.12
To be successful in the banking industry, employees for a bank, 
S&L, credit union, or other financial institution must possess the 
following traits:
	 1.	You must be honest. Because you are handling other people’s 
money, many financial institutions go to great lengths to dis-
cover dishonest employees.
	 2.	You must be able to interact with people. A number of posi-
tions in the banking industry require that you possess the 
interpersonal skills needed to interact not only with other 
employees but also with customers.
	 3.	You need a strong background in accounting. Many of the 
routine tasks performed by employees in the banking industry are basic account-
ing functions. For example, a teller must post deposits or withdrawals to a cus-
tomer’s account and then balance out at the end of the day to ensure accuracy.
	 4.	You need to appreciate the relationship between banking and finance. Bank offi-
cers must interview loan applicants and determine if their request for money is 
based on sound financial principles. Above all, loan officers must be able to evalu-
ate applicants and their loan requests to determine if the borrower will be able to 
repay a loan.
	 5.	You should possess basic computer skills. Almost all employees in the banking 
industry use a computer for some aspect of their work on a daily basis.
Depending on qualifications, work experience, and education, starting salaries 
generally are between $18,000 and $30,000 a year, but it is not uncommon for college 
graduates to earn $35,000 a year or more.
Traditional Services Provided 
by Financial Institutions
To determine how important banking services are to you, ask yourself just three simple 
questions:
●
●How many checks did you write last month?
●
●Do you have a credit or debit card? If so, how often do you use it?
●
●How many times did you visit an ATM last month?
If you are like most people and business firms, you would find it hard to live a nor-
mal life without the services provided by banks and other financial institutions. Typical 
services provided by a bank or other financial institution are illustrated in Figure 18.4.
The most important traditional banking services for both individuals and busi-
nesses are described in this section. Online banking, electronic transfer of funds, and 
other significant and future developments are discussed in the next section.
Checking Accounts
Firms and individuals deposit money in checking accounts (demand deposits) so that 
they can write checks to pay for purchases. A check is a written order for a bank or

other financial institution to pay a stated dollar amount to the business or person 
indicated on the face of the check. Today, some financial institutions offer free checking; 
others charge activity fees (or service charges) for checking accounts. Fees and charges 
generally range from $5 to $20 per month for individuals. For businesses, monthly 
charges are based on the average daily balance in the checking account, the number of 
checks written, or both. Charges for business checking accounts are often higher than 
those for individual accounts.
Most financial institutions offer interest-paying accounts called NOW (negotiable 
order of withdrawal) accounts that allow customers to write checks. A NOW account 
is an interest-paying checking account. For these accounts, the usual interest rate is 
between 0.05 percent and 0.25 percent. Typically, online Internet banks pay slightly 
higher interest rates. However, individual banks often impose certain restrictions on 
their NOW accounts.
Although banks and other financial institutions may pay low interest rates on 
checking accounts, even small earnings are better than no earnings. In addition to 
interest rates, be sure to compare monthly fees before opening a checking account for 
your personal use or a business.
Savings Accounts
Savings accounts (time deposits) provide a safe place to store money and a very 
conservative means of investing. At the time of publication, passbook savings accounts 
earned between 0.05 percent and 0.50 percent in commercial banks and S&Ls and 
slightly more in credit unions or online Internet banks.
A depositor who is willing to leave money on deposit with a bank for a set period 
of time can earn a higher rate of interest. To do so, the depositor buys a certificate of 
deposit. A certificate of deposit (CD) is a document stating that the bank will pay 
the depositor a guaranteed interest rate on money left on deposit for a specified period 
of time. At the time of publication, interest rates have ranged from 0.50 to 2 percent. 
The rate always depends on how much is invested and for how long. Generally, the 
rule is: The longer the period of time until maturity, the higher is the rate. Depositors 
are penalized for early withdrawal of funds invested in CDs.
Short- and Long-Term Loans
Banks, S&Ls, credit unions, and other financial institutions provide short- and long-
term loans to both individuals and businesses. Short-term business loans must be 
repaid within one year or less. Typical uses for the money obtained through short-term 
loans include solving cash-flow problems, purchasing inventory, monthly expenses, 
and meeting unexpected emergencies.

electronic services, and international services.

To help ensure that short-term money will be available when needed, many firms 
establish a line of credit. A line of credit is a loan that is approved before the money 
is actually needed. Because all the necessary paperwork is already completed and the 
loan is pre-approved, the business can obtain the money later without delay, as soon 
as it is required. Even with a line of credit, a firm may not be able to borrow money if 
the bank does not have sufficient funds available. For this reason, some firms prefer a 
revolving credit agreement, which is a guaranteed line of credit.
Long-term business loans are repaid over a period of years. The average length of 
a long-term business loan is generally three to seven years but sometimes as long as 
15 years or in a few cases even longer periods of time. Long-term loans are used most 
often to finance the expansion of buildings and retail facilities, 
mergers and acquisitions, replacement of equipment, or product 
development.
Most lenders require some type of collateral for long-term 
loans. Collateral is real estate or property (stocks, bonds, 
equipment, or any other asset of value) pledged as security for 
a loan. For example, when an individual obtains a loan to pay 
for a new Chevrolet Malibu, the automobile is the collateral for 
the loan. If the borrower fails to repay the loan according to the 
terms specified in the loan agreement, the lender can repossess 
the car.
Repayment terms and interest rates for both short- and long-
term loans are arranged between the lender and the borrower. 
For businesses, repayment terms may include monthly, quarterly, 
semiannual, or annual payments. Repayment terms and interest 
rates for personal loans vary depending on how the money will 
be used and what type of collateral, if any, is pledged. However, 
individuals typically make monthly payments to repay personal 
loans. Borrowers always should “shop” for a loan, comparing the 
repayment terms and interest rates offered by competing financial 
institutions.
Kiva.org Connects Microloan Borrowers and Lenders 
Entrepreneurial
Success
© elnur/Shutterstock
Kiva.org is a non-profit organization that 
connects individual lenders—anyone who can 
lend at least $25—with borrowers who need a 
bit of cash to go into business or keep a business 
running. Microloans are much too small for traditional 
lenders, but large enough to make a big difference to low-
income entrepreneurs who need to buy a fishing net, a box of 
merchandise for resale, or a bicycle to make deliveries. 
Working through local organizations in 61 nations, Kiva 
posts borrowers’ photos and stories on its Web site. Lenders 
determine which borrowers will receive their money, and Kiva’s 
local partners manage the disbursement and repayment of 
the loans. As little as $200 can start a borrower in Peru or 
Kenya on the road to becoming a self-sufficient small business 
owner. Kiva has arranged loans of up to $10,000, helping 
entrepreneurs in New Orleans and elsewhere upgrade business 
equipment or branch out into new services. 
Since Kiva was founded in 2005, it has arranged more than 
$300 million in microloans with money from 740,000 lenders 
in 218 countries. Nearly 99 percent of all loans are repaid, an 
extremely high percentage. Once a loan is repaid, the lender 
can reloan the money to another borrower, starting the cycle 
over again. “It’s a different kind of financing opportunity,” says 
the CEO. “It’s personal.”

How do you pay for your purchases? Today more 
and more people are using credit and debit cards to 
pay for their purchases. For consumers, “plastic cards” 
are convenient and fast. For the merchant, credit and 
debit card transactions can be converted to cash and 
improve a firm’s cash flow.

Part 7   Finance and Investment
Credit Card and Debit 
Card Transactions
By the end of 2012, 160 million Americans will use credit 
cards to pay for everything from tickets on American 
Airlines to Zebco fishing gear.13 Why have credit cards 
become so popular?
For a merchant, the answer is obvious. By depositing 
charge slips in a bank or other financial institution, the 
merchant can convert credit card sales into cash. In return 
for processing the merchant’s credit card transactions, the finan-
cial institution charges a fee that generally ranges between 1.5 and 
4 percent. Let’s assume that you use a Visa credit card to purchase 
a microwave oven for $300 from Gold Star Appliance, a retailer in 
Richardson, Texas. At the end of the day, the retailer deposits your 
charge slip, along with other charge slips, checks, and currency 
collected during the day, at its bank. If the bank charges Gold Star 
Appliance 4 percent to process each credit card transaction, the 
bank deducts a processing fee of $12 ($300 3 0.04 5 $12) for 
your credit card transaction and immediately deposits the remain-
der ($288) in Gold Star Appliance’s account. Typically, small busi-
nesses pay more than larger businesses. The number of credit card 
transactions, the total dollar amount of credit sales, and how well 
the merchant can negotiate the fees the bank charges determine 
actual fees.
Do not confuse debit cards with credit cards. Although they may look alike, there 
are important differences. A debit card electronically subtracts the amount of your 
purchase from your bank account at the moment the purchase is made. (By contrast, 
when you use your credit card, the credit card company extends short-term financing, 
and you do not make payment until you receive your next statement.) Debit cards are 
used most commonly to obtain cash at ATMs and to purchase products and services 
from retailers.
Innovative Banking Services
Today, many individuals, financial managers, and business owners are finding it 
convenient to do their banking electronically. Let’s begin by looking at how banking 
will change in the future.
Changes in the Banking Industry
While the experts may not be able to predict with 100 percent accuracy the changes 
that will affect banking, they all agree that banking will change. The most obvious 
changes the experts do agree on are as follows:
●
●More emphasis on evaluating the credit-worthiness of loan applicants as a result 
of the recent economic crisis
●
●An increase in government regulation of the banking industry
●
●A reduction in the number of banks, S&Ls, credit unions, and financial institutions 
because of consolidation and mergers
●
●Globalization of the banking industry as the economies of individual nations 
become more interrelated
●
●The importance of customer service as a way to keep customers from switching 
to competitors
●
●Increased use of credit and debit cards and a decrease in the number of written 
checks
●
●Continued growth in online and mobile banking

institutions are changing to 
meet the needs of domestic 
and international customers.
Social
Media
Outsmart the Scam Artists
You may be able to friend your bank on Facebook, 
but watch out for scam artists who use social media 
to steal identities. If your full birth date, address, 
or e-mail is in your public Facebook profile, fraudsters 
can take those details, dig up other information about 
you, and apply for credit using your identity. Another 
scam is an application that offers something free (such as 
Facebook credits) if you will complete a survey or send in 
friends’ e-mail addresses. Once you click, this application 
accesses your complete profile and your posts—and posts 
messages on friends’ walls about this new “opportunity.” 
But by keeping your data private, you can outsmart the 
scam artists.

Online, Mobile, and International Banking
Online banking allows you to access your bank’s computer system from home, the 
office, or even while you are traveling. For the customer, online banking offers a 
number of advantages, including the following:
●
●The ability to obtain current account balances
●
●The capability to deposit checks without leaving your home or office
●
●The convenience of transferring funds from one account to 
another
●
●The ability to pay bills
●
●The convenience of seeing which checks have cleared
●
●Simplified loan application procedures
Online banking provides a number of advantages for the finan-
cial institution. Probably the most important advantage is the lower 
cost of processing large numbers of transactions. As you learned 
in Chapter 17, lower costs often lead to larger profits. In addition 
to lower costs and increased profits, financial institutions believe 
that online banking offers increased security because fewer people 
handle fewer paper documents.
In addition to online banking, many banks now offer mobile 
banking via text message or apps (software applications) down-
loaded to cell phones and other electronic devices. The goal is to 
let customers use technology to check account balances, transfer 
money, and track deposits at any time, from anywhere. This is espe-
cially convenient for busy businesspeople who don’t live or work 
next door to a bank branch and can’t always get to a computer to 
use online banking.  
Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)  An electronic funds trans-
fer (EFT) system is a means of performing financial transactions 
Now you can bank with a click of a computer’s 
mouse. With improved technology, bank customers 
can now deposit checks without leaving their office or 
home, obtain current account balances, and pay bills 
online. In fact, many of the traditional banking services 
that used to require a trip to the bank can now be 
completed online. Why not take a look at your bank’s 
Web site to see how online banking can help you 
manage your finances?

Vying to Run Your Digital Wallet 
Cash isn’t going away any time soon, 
but Google, PayPal, Visa, and other big 
companies are already competing to run 
the digital wallet that could replace your leather 
wallet in the future. The idea is to speed up transactions and 
make them as convenient as the one-click payments many 
online businesses accept. Instead of handing bills and coins 
to a cashier or waiting for change, you use your digital wallet 
(typically, your cell phone) to transfer money electronically 
to the business you’re buying from. Your digital wallet might 
even alert you to special deals or earn you rewards for certain 
purchases. 
The Google Wallet, for example, uses a wireless technology 
called near field communication to let your cell phone app 
“talk” to a cash register and arrange payment (charged to your 
credit card or another card) with just a tap of the phone. Subway 
sandwich shops and Macy’s were among the first businesses to 
accept Google Wallet payments. PayPal’s system, which works 
as an app and online, has an interesting feature: After you pay, 
you have several days to decide where the money will come 
from—a store credit card or a bank debit card, for example. 
Billions of dollars in cash transactions are going cashless every 
year. Is a digital wallet in your future?

Part 7   Finance and Investment
through a computer terminal or telephone hookup. The following four EFT applica-
tions are changing how banks do business:
	 1.	Automatic teller machines (ATMs). An ATM is an electronic bank teller—a 
machine that provides almost any service a human teller can provide. Once the 
customer is properly identified, the machine dispenses cash from the customer’s 
checking or savings account or makes a cash advance charged to a credit card. 
ATMs are located in bank parking lots, supermarkets, drugstores, and even gas 
stations. Customers have access to them at all times of the day or night. There may 
be a fee for each transaction.
	 2.	Automated clearinghouse (ACH). Designed to reduce the number of paper checks, 
an automated clearinghouse processes Social Security benefits, tax payments, 
recurring bill payments, payments for Internet sales, and employee salaries. For 
example, many large companies use the ACH network to transfer wages and sala-
ries directly into their employees’ bank accounts, thus eliminating the need to 
make out individual paychecks.
	 3.	Point-of-sale (POS) terminals. A POS terminal is a computerized cash register 
located in a retail store and connected to a bank’s computer. Assume you want 
to pay for purchases at a Walmart Supercenter. You begin the process by pulling 
your credit or debit card through a magnetic card reader. A central processing 
center notifies a computer at your bank that you want to make a purchase. The 
bank’s computer immediately adds the amount to your account for a credit card 
transaction. In a similar process, the bank’s computer deducts the amount of the 
purchase from your bank account if you use a debit card. Finally, the amount 
of your purchase is added to the retailer’s account. The Walmart store then is 
notified that the transaction is complete, and the cash register prints out your 
receipt.
	 4.	Electronic check conversion (ECC). Electronic check conversion is a process used 
to convert information from a paper check into an electronic payment for mer-
chandise, services, or bills. When you give your completed check to a cashier at a 
Best Buy store, the check is processed through an electronic system that captures 
your banking information and the dollar amount of the check. Once the check is 
processed, you are asked to sign a receipt, and you get a voided 
(canceled) check back for your records. Finally, the funds to pay for 
your transaction are transferred into the Best Buy store’s account. 
ECC also can be used for checks you mail to pay for a purchase or 
to pay on an account.
Bankers and business owners generally are pleased with  
online banking and EFT systems. Both online banking and EFT 
are fast, and they eliminate the costly processing of checks. 
However, many customers are reluctant to use online banking or 
EFT systems. Some simply do not like “the technology,” whereas 
others fear that the computer will garble their accounts. Early 
on, in 1978, Congress responded to such fears by passing the 
Electronic Funds Transfer Act, which protects the customer in 
case the bank makes an error or the customer’s account informa-
tion is stolen.
International Banking Services  For international businesses, 
banking services are extremely important. Depending on the needs 
of an international firm, a bank can help by providing a letter of 
credit or a banker’s acceptance.
A letter of credit is a legal document issued by a bank or other 
financial institution guaranteeing to pay a seller a stated amount for 
a specified period of time—usually 30 to 60 days. With a letter of 
Why is a French bank in the United States? 
Because it makes perfect business sense in a world 
where national boundaries blur and multinational 
firms operate in many different countries. Actually, the 
number of U.S. banks that operate overseas and the 
number of foreign banks that operate in the United 
States are both increasing. For banks, the world is 
becoming smaller and much more competitive.

credit, certain conditions, such as delivery of the merchandise, may be specified before 
payment is made.
A banker’s acceptance is a written order for a bank to pay a third party a stated 
amount of money on a specific date. With a banker’s acceptance, no conditions are 
specified. It is simply an order to pay guaranteed by a bank without any strings attached.
Both a letter of credit and a banker’s acceptance are popular methods of paying for 
import and export transactions. For example, imagine that you are a business owner in 
the United States who wants to purchase some leather products from a small business 
in Florence, Italy. You offer to pay for the merchandise with your company’s check 
drawn on an American bank, but the Italian business owner is worried about pay-
ment. To solve the problem, your bank can issue either a letter of credit or a banker’s 
acceptance to guarantee that payment will be made. In addition to a letter of credit 
and a banker’s acceptance, banks also can use EFT technology to speed international 
banking transactions.
One other international banking service should be noted. Banks and other 
financial institutions provide for currency exchange. If you place an order for mer-
chandise valued at $50,000 from a company in Japan, how do you pay for the 
order? Do you use U.S. dollars or Japanese yen? To solve this problem, you can use 
a bank’s currency-exchange service. To make payment, you can use either currency. 
If necessary, the bank will exchange one currency for the other to complete your 
transaction.
The FDIC and NCUA
During the Great Depression, which began in 1929, a number of banks failed, and 
their depositors lost all their savings. To make sure that such a disaster did not happen 
again and to restore public confidence in the banking industry, the 
U.S. Congress enacted legislation that created the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 1933. The primary purpose of the 
FDIC is to insure deposits against bank failures.
Today, the FDIC provides basic deposit insurance of 
$250,000 per depositor. Deposits maintained in different cat-
egories of legal ownership are insured separately. Thus, you can 
have increased coverage for different categories of ownership 
in a single institution. The most common categories of owner-
ship are single (or individual) ownership and joint ownership. 
A depositor also may obtain additional coverage by opening 
separate accounts in different financial institutions. To determine 
if your deposits are insured or if your bank or financial institu-
tion is insured, visit the FDIC Web site at www.fdic.gov or call 
1-877-ASK-FDIC.
To obtain coverage, banks and S&Ls must pay insurance pre-
miums to the FDIC. In a similar manner, the National Credit Union 
Administration (NCUA) insures deposits in member credit unions 
for up to $250,000 per depositor. Like FDIC coverage, increased 
coverage is provided for accounts with different categories of 
ownership.
 The FDIC and NCUA have improved banking in the United

tution’s deposits, they reserve the right to examine that institution’s 
operations periodically. If a bank, S&L, savings bank, or credit 
union is found to be poorly managed, it is reported to the proper 
banking authority.

Effective Credit Management
One of the most important activities of any financial institution or business is making 
wise decisions regarding to whom it will extend credit. Credit is immediate purchasing 
power that is exchanged for a promise to repay borrowed money, with or without 
interest, at a later date. For example, suppose that you obtain a bank loan to buy a 
$150,000 home. You, as the borrower, obtain immediate purchasing power. In return, 
you agree to certain terms imposed by the lender. Generally, the lender requires that you 
make a down payment, make monthly payments, pay interest, and purchase insurance 
to protect your home until the loan is paid in full.
Banks and other financial institutions lend money because they are in business for 
that purpose. The interest they charge is what provides their profit. Other businesses 
extend credit to their customers for at least three reasons. 
Some customers simply cannot afford to pay the entire amount of their purchase 
immediately, but they can repay credit in a number of smaller payments stretched out 
over some period of time. Some firms are forced to sell goods or services on credit to 
compete effectively when other firms offer credit to their customers. 
Finally, firms can realize a profit from interest charges that a borrower pays on 
some credit arrangements.
Getting Money from a Bank or 
Lender after the Economic Crisis
While lenders need interest from loans to help pay 
their business expenses and earn a profit, they also 
want to make sure that the loans they make will be 
repaid. As a borrower, your job is to convince the 
lender that you are able and willing to repay the loan. 
After the recent economic crisis, bankers, lenders and 
suppliers, and credit card companies are much more careful 
when evaluating credit applications. 
For individuals, the following suggestions may be helpful 
when applying for credit:
●
●Obtain a loan application and complete it at home. At home, 
you have the information needed to answer all the questions on 
the loan application.
●
●Be prepared to describe how you will use the money and how 
the loan will be repaid.
●
●For most loans, an interview with a loan officer is required. 
Here again, preparation is the key. Think about how you would 
respond to questions a loan officer might ask.
●
●If your loan request is rejected, try to analyze what went 
wrong. Ask the loan officer why you were rejected. If the rejec-
tion is based on incorrect information, supply the correct infor-
mation and reapply.
Business owners in need of financing may find the follow-
ing additional tips helpful:
●
●It is usually best to develop a relationship with your banker 
before you need financing. 
●
●Help the banker understand what your business is and how 
you may need future financing for expansion, cash-flow prob-
lems, or unexpected emergencies.

No one likes to pay more than they have to for anything. 
And yet, many consumers often pay more for loans than 
necessary. Factors that increase the amount of interest you 
pay for credit cards, an auto loan, or a home mortgage 
include how well you have paid your bills in the past, 
the amount of debt you currently have, and your credit 
score. It also helps to compare rates for different types of 
consumer credit. Even a one percent lower interest rate for 
a home mortgage, for example, can save you thousands of 
dollars over the life of a home loan.

●
●Apply for a pre-approved line of credit or revolving credit agreement even if you 
do not need the money. View the application as another way to showcase your 
company and its products or services.
●
●In addition to the application, supply certified public accountant (CPA)-prepared 
financial statements and business tax returns for the last three years. If your busi-
ness is small, you may want to supply your own personal financial statements and 
tax returns for the same period.
●
●Update your business plan in case the lender wants to review your plan. Be sure 
the sales estimates and other projections are realistic.
●
●Write a cover letter describing how much experience you have, whether you are 
operating in an expanding market, or any other information that would help con-
vince the banker to provide financing.
The Five C’s of Credit Management
When a business extends credit to its customers, it must face the fact that some customers 
will be unable or unwilling to pay for their credit purchases. To help determine if an 
individual or business is a good credit risk, lenders often examine a business firm’s 
financial statements. Individuals may be asked to complete a credit application like 
the one illustrated in Figure 18.5. Most lenders will also consider the five C’s of credit, 
described in Table 18.3.
Checking Credit Information
The five C’s of credit are concerned mainly with information supplied by the applicant. 
But how can a lender determine whether this information is accurate? This depends on 
whether the potential borrower is a business or an individual consumer.
Credit information concerning businesses can be obtained from the following four 
sources:
●
●Global credit-reporting agencies. D&B (formerly Dun & Bradstreet) is the world’s 
leading credit-reporting agency. Their reports present detailed credit information 
about specific companies. For more information on D&B services, visit the com-
pany’s Web site at www.dnb.com.
●
●Local credit-reporting agencies. These agencies may require a monthly or yearly 
fee for providing information on a continual basis.
●
●Industry associations. These associations may charge a service fee.
●
●Other firms. This refers to other firms that have given the applicant credit.
Table 18.3	  The Five C’s of Credit
Lenders often use the five C’s of credit to determine which credit or loan requests will 
be approved and which will be rejected.
Factor to Consider
Description of Why This Factor Is Important 
Character
The borrower’s attitude toward credit obligations 
Capacity
The financial ability to meet credit obligations—that is, to 
make regular loan payments.
Capital
The term capital as used here refers to the borrower’s assets 
or the net worth of the individual or business applying for a 
loan.
Collateral
Real estate or property including stocks, bonds, equipment, 
or any other asset pledged as security for a loan.
Conditions
General economic conditions that can affect a borrower’s 
ability to repay a loan or other credit obligation.

Various credit bureaus provide credit information concerning individuals. The fol-
lowing are the three major consumer credit bureaus:
●
●Experian—at www.experian.com or toll-free at 888-397-3742
●
●TransUnion—at www.transunion.com or toll-free at 800-888-4213
●
●Equifax Credit Information Services—at www.equifax.com or toll-free at 
800-685-1111
Protection for Consumers
Consumer credit bureaus are subject to the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 
This act safeguards consumers’ rights in two ways. First, you have the right to know 
what information is contained in your credit bureau file. Second, if you feel that some 
information in the file is inaccurate, misleading, or vague you have the right to request 
that the credit bureau verify it. If the disputed information is found to be correct, 
you can provide a brief explanation, giving your side of the dispute. If the disputed 
information is found to be inaccurate, it must be deleted or corrected. Furthermore, 
you may request that any lender or prospective employer that has been supplied an 
inaccurate credit report in the last six months be sent a corrected credit report.
The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act requires each of the nationwide 
credit reporting companies—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—to provide you with 
a free copy of your credit report, at your request, once every 12 months. To obtain your 
free credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com. (Note: Beware of other sites that 
may look and sound similar to this site but may charge for information or require that 
you spend money on credit monitoring.14)  
The Credit Card Act of 2009, which was enacted on February 22, 2010, also pro-
vides additional protection for credit card customers. This new federal law is designed 
to level the playing field between credit card customers and financial institutions that 
issue credit cards. This act encourages disclosures written in plain language that include 
more information about due dates, late fees, and the amount of time required to pay off 
card balances if only minimum monthly payments are made.15 If you want more infor-
mation about provisions in the Credit Card Act of 2009, contact the financial institu-
tion that issued your credit card, the Federal Reserve Board (www.federalreserve.gov), 
or conduct a Web search.
In the next chapter, you will see why firms need financing, how they obtain the 
money they need, and how they ensure that funds are used efficiently, in keeping with 
their organizational objectives.

How many bank CEOs invite customers to call them with 
questions, compliments, or complaints? Every Umpqua 
Bank store (its preferred term for branches) has a direct 
phone line to the CEO’s office, part of the bank’s person-
alized, community-oriented customer service. At a time 
when so many companies are moving away from face-to-
face service, Umpqua Bank is encouraging people to drop 
in and chat, even when they don’t have any transactions 
to conduct. The bank also connects with customers via 
Facebook and Twitter, as well as through its own Web site. 
Employees go to the World’s Greatest Bank University 
(its in-house training facility) for classes on customer-service 
techniques and product knowledge. They are also paid for 
up to 40 hours of volunteer work each year because of the 
bank’s commitment to community involvement. No wonder 
Umpqua has been named six times to Fortune’s list of “100 
Best Companies to Work For.” 
Questions
1.	 Why would Umpqua go out of its way to make each

Part 7   Finance and Investment
Identify the functions and characteristics of 
money.
Money is anything a society uses to purchase products, 
services, or resources. Money must serve as a medium of 
exchange, a measure of value, and a store of value. To 
perform its functions effectively, money must be divisible 
into units of convenient size, light and sturdy enough to 
be carried and used on a daily basis, stable in value, and 
difficult to counterfeit. The M1 supply of money is made 
up of coins and bills (currency) and deposits in checking 
accounts (demand deposits). The M2 supply includes M1 
plus savings accounts, certain money-market securities, and 
certificates of deposits.
Summarize how the Federal Reserve System 
regulates the money supply to maintain a healthy 
economy.
The Federal Reserve System is responsible for regulating the 
U.S. banking industry and maintaining a sound economic 
environment. Banks with federal charters (national banks) 
must be members of the Fed. State banks may join if they can 
meet the requirements for membership. Twelve district banks 
and 24 branch banks compose the Federal Reserve System, 
whose seven-member board of governors is headquartered in 
Washington, D.C. During the recent economic crisis, it was 
necessary for the Federal Reserve to take actions in order to 
reduce the effects of the recent economic crisis. Specifically, 
the Fed provided liquidity to the banking and financial 
industry, supported troubled financial markets, supported 
troubled financial institutions, and conducted stress tests of 
major banks. 
To control the supply of money, the Federal Reserve 
System regulates the reserve requirement, or the percentage 
of deposits a bank must keep on hand. It also regulates the 
discount rate, or the interest rate the Fed charges member 
banks for loans from the Federal Reserve. It also engages 
in open-market operations, in which it buys and sells gov-
ernment securities. When the Federal Reserve buys and sells 
securities, the goal is to increase or decrease the federal funds 
rate. The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which a 
bank lends immediately available funds on deposit at the Fed 
to another bank overnight in order to meet the borrowing 
bank’s reserve requirements. The Fed serves as the govern-
ment’s bank and is also responsible for clearing checks and 
electronic transfers, inspecting currency, enforcing the Truth-
in-Lending Act, and setting margin requirements for securi-
ties transactions.
Describe the organizations involved in the 
banking industry.
Most everyone has been affected in one way or another by 
the nation’s economic problems. To help resolve the major 
problems that led to the economic crisis, Congress passed and 
the president signed the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act that provides new protection for 
consumers and increased regulation of the financial industry. 
A commercial bank is a profit-making organization that 
accepts deposits, makes loans, and provides related services 
to customers. Commercial banks are chartered by the federal 
government or state governments. Savings and loan asso-
ciations and credit unions offer the same basic services that 
commercial banks provide. Mutual savings banks, insurance 
companies, pension funds, brokerage firms, finance com-
panies, and investment banking firms provide some limited 
banking services. A large number of people work in the 
banking industry because of the number of banks and other 
financial institutions. 
Identify the services provided by financial 
institutions.
Banks and other financial institutions offer today’s customers 
a tempting array of services. Among the most important 
banking services for both individuals and businesses are 
checking accounts, savings accounts, short- and long-term 
loans, and processing credit card and debit card transactions. 
Other traditional services include financial advice, payroll 
services, certified checks, trust services, and safe-deposit 
boxes.
Understand how financial institutions are 
changing to meet the needs of domestic and 
international customers.
Competition among banks, brokerage firms, insurance 
companies, and other financial institutions has increased. The 
use of technology will also increase as financial institutions 
continue to offer online and mobile banking. Increased 
use of electronic funds transfer systems (automated teller 
machines, automated clearinghouses, point-of-sale terminals, 
and electronic check conversion) also will change the way 
people bank. For firms in the global marketplace, a bank 
can provide letters of credit and banker’s acceptances that 
will reduce the risk of nonpayment for sellers. Banks and 
financial institutions also can provide currency exchange to 
reduce payment problems for import or export transactions.
Explain how deposit insurance protects 
customers.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the 
National Credit Union Association (NCUA) insure accounts 
in member financial institutions for up $250,000. Deposits

maintained in different categories of legal ownership are 
insured separately. The most common ownership categories 
are single ownership and joint ownership. It is also possible 
to obtain additional coverage by opening separate accounts 
in different banks, S&Ls, or credit unions. When either the 
FDIC or NCUA insures a financial institution’s deposits, 
they reserve the right to examine that institution’s operations 
periodically. If a bank, S&L, or credit union is found to be 
poorly managed, it is reported to the proper banking authority.
Discuss the importance of credit and credit 
management.
Credit is immediate purchasing power that is exchanged 
for a promise to repay borrowed money, with or without 
interest, at a later date. Banks lend money because they 
are in business for that purpose. Businesses sell goods and 
services on credit because some customers cannot afford to 
pay cash and because they must keep pace with competitors 
who offer credit. Businesses also may realize a profit from 
interest charges.
Decisions on whether to grant credit to businesses and 
individuals usually are based on the five C’s of credit: char-
acter, capacity, capital, collateral, and conditions. Credit 
information can be obtained from various credit-reporting 
agencies, credit bureaus, industry associations, and other 
firms. A number of federal regulations even the playing 
field between consumers and credit card companies and 
lenders.

Discussion Questions
JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a global financial holding com-
pany formed in 2000 by a merger of the financial institutions 
that today are its two major brands: Chase (formerly Chase 
Manhattan Corp.) and J.P. Morgan (formerly J.P. Morgan & 
Co.). In 2004, the company also acquired Bank One Corp.; 
later, in 2008, it added both Bear Stearns Companies, Inc., and 
Washington Mutual, in the process creating the second-largest 
branch network in the United States and bringing its banking 
services within the reach of 42 percent of the U.S. population. 
The bank, which operates in more than 60 countries and employs 
almost 240,000 people worldwide, holds assets estimated to be 
worth about $2 trillion and is included in the widely watched 
stock index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Despite an 
economic downturn, the bank still posted profits for the last four 
years in a row. And now that the nation’s economy is improving, 
the bank is poised for more growth and increased profits.
Most people are probably more familiar with the functions 
performed on the Chase side of the operation. These operations 
include conducting everyday banking via branch offices, ATMs, 
telephone, and online; issuing consumer credit cards; serving 
small businesses with financing and banking services; offering 
home mortgages and home equity loans; helping customers with 
personal retirement and investment planning; and making auto 
and educational loans.
In its small-business banking operations, Chase exemplifies the 
words of J.P. Morgan, who told a Senate subcommittee in 1933 
that “Another very important use of the banker is to serve as a 
channel whereby industry may be provided with capital to meet 
its needs for expansion and development.” Providing capital to 
small businesses is one of the most important functions the bank 
fulfills for these business clients. Whether small companies need 
short-term loans to expand their operations or to bridge the time 
gap between manufacturing a product and collecting money for 
the sale, a line of credit to ease their cash flow during a tough 
period, or a commercial mortgage loan to buy a new factory or 
warehouse, Chase is ready to lend the necessary funds. The bank 
also offers several kinds of business credit cards, which small-
business owners can use for everyday needs when cash is tight. 
These cards offer different incentives such as no annual fee, cash 
back for purchases, bonus points, or no interest on balances 
paid in full each month. Business debit cards are another option, 
backed by fraud monitoring and account alerts.
Chase is also there to help firms hang on to their money—not 
only by providing all those branch offices for making deposits 
but also by handling the safe collection of payments through its 
lock-box service (through which consumers send bill payments 
to a post-office box for collection). Chase makes it easier for 
its small-business customers to deposit checks, too. Now firms 
can scan paper checks right in their own offices, transforming 
them into electronic payments so that they can take advantage 
of online banking’s convenience, safety, and speed. Business 
checking accounts are available as well, with a wide range of 
specially tailored features and overdraft protection. Business sav-
ings accounts and CDs are offered, and business customers can 
link their accounts to Chase Business Packages to earn additional 
benefits, such as waived fees and reduced interest rates on bor-
rowing. The bank even offers payroll processing.
Retail firms that accept credit cards like Visa, American 
Express, MasterCard, and Discover can rely on Chase for 
­payment processing, and they can use the processed funds the 
very next day. Free technical support is available 24/7, and 
monthly statements and online reports help firms manage their 
credit card operations. Business owners can even pay bills, 
transfer funds, view account balances and transaction history, 
and send wire transfers by texting the bank from their mobile 
phones. Additionally, Chase makes it possible for small busi-
nesses to conduct transactions globally, whether that means 
buying goods abroad or accepting orders from international 
customers.16
Questions
1.	 If you were a small-business owner, would you take advantage 
of any of Chase’s or another bank’s small-business banking 
services? Why or why not?
2.	 Can you think of any additional financial or banking services 
that banks could offer to small-business owners?
3.	 Chase prides itself on its ability to know many of its business 
customers personally and to keep up-to-date on the indus-
tries in which they operate. Why would this familiarity be an 
advantage for the bank?

Established 62 years before Hawaii became a state, Bank of 
Hawaii is now one of the top-ranked independent banks in 
America, known as much for its community involvement as for its 
financial strength. With 81 branches spread across six Hawaiian 
islands, American Samoa, Saipan, Guam, and Palau, Bank of 
Hawaii provides a full range of financial services for corporations, 
small businesses, and individuals. From traditional checking and 
savings accounts to loans, mobile banking, online bill payment, 
and even international trade finance, Bank of Hawaii offers all the 
services its customers need to achieve their financial goals.
The Honolulu-based bank briefly experimented with an expan-
sion on the mainland before refocusing on its home state, where 
its heritage and market share are competitive advantages. “The 
industry recognizes that Hawaii is a challenging place to do busi-
ness,” says CEO Peter Ho. “It’s the most ethnically diverse state 
in the country in many ways.” With this diversity in mind, Bank 
of Hawaii offers customers the choice of communicating in 
Japanese, Korean, French, Tagalog, Vietnamese, or any of three 
Chinese dialects. Also, the bank has arranged for the growing 
number of Chinese tourists who visit Hawaii to use their China 
UnionPay debit cards at any of Bank of Hawaii’s ATMs. 
	Two-thirds of Hawaiian households use at least one of the 
bank’s services, and it enjoys high customer loyalty within the 
business community, as well. Bank of Hawaii gave the founder 
of Yummy’s Restaurant Group his first business loan more than 
25 years ago. Today, the chain has grown to more than 40 res-
taurants, and both the company and its founder remain loyal 
customers. Maui Soda and Ice Works, a family-owned firm that 
makes ice cream sold throughout the Hawaiian islands, appreci-
ates the bank’s professionalism and its expertise in matters such 
as local economic forecasting. The bank was recently named 
Small Business Association lender of the year in Hawaii, reflecting 
its strength in providing financial services for entrepreneurs and 
growing businesses. 
To help customers learn to better manage their money, Bank 
of Hawaii offers monthly seminars on topics such as buying a 
home, saving for retirement, developing a business plan, and 
making investment decisions. More than 2,000 of the bank’s 
employees participate in community projects such as Junior 
Achievement, the Hawaii Book and Music Festival, and envi-
ronmental cleanup programs. The annual “employee giving” 
campaign raises $500,000 every year to benefit local nonprofit 
groups, and the bank donates tens of thousands of dollars for 
scholarships and other community needs. 
Bank of Hawaii remained profitable even during the recent 
recession, thanks in large part to its sound lending practices 
and its ability to adapt to changing economic and technological 
conditions. As customers began using iPhones and other digital 
devices, the bank expanded its mobile and online banking services 
to provide instant, on-the-go access to financial information. 
Bank representatives tweet and also post on the bank’s Facebook 
page to stay in touch with customers who like to use social 
media. For added convenience, the bank is opening new branches 
inside popular stores, allowing customers to bank where they 
shop. Finally, bank officials have created a “business dashboard” 
to track performance on key measures of customer service and 
identify any areas for improvement.17

2 	JOURNALING FOR SUCCESS
You could be one of the 11 million Americans who fall victim 
to the crime of identity theft every year. Crooks who steal your 
name, birth date, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, 
and Social Security number can withdraw money from your bank 
accounts, charge merchandise in your name, or contract for cell-
phone service.
Assignment
1.	 Use the Internet to obtain information about how to 
­prevent identity theft. Then, according to the professionals, 
describe the steps someone should take to protect his or 
her identity.
2.	 Complete a “security audit” of your personal information and 
financial records. Based on your audit and the recommenda-
tions from professionals, what should you do now to protect 
your identity?
3.	 It always helps to have a plan in case your identity is stolen. 
Based on the information you obtained from your Internet 
research, what immediate steps should you take if your iden-
tity is stolen?
3 	DEVELOPING CRITICAL-THINKING SKILLS
Assumption: There are banks, savings and loan associations, 
credit unions, and other financial institutions that want your 
business. Therefore, it pays to shop around for the lowest inter-
est rates for loans needed to purchase a home mortgage or an 
automobile. It’s also easy to compare interest rates when invest-
ing in certificates of deposit (CDs) or savings accounts. A logical 
place to start is with the financial institution where you do your 
banking. You can also compare interest rates at other local banks 
and financial institutions located close to where you live or work. 
Finally, you can use the Internet and Web sites like www.bankrate.
com or www.interest.com to determine interest rates for loans 
and CD investments.
Assignment
To answer each of the following questions, contact at least three 
different financial institutions in your city or town or three differ-
ent Internet Web sites. Hint: If you use the Internet, use a search 
engine like Google or Yahoo! and enter “interest rates” in the 
search window.
1.	 What is the lowest rate you found for a 30-year $150,000 
home mortgage?
2.	 Based on your research, what is the difference between the 
lowest interest rate and the highest interest rate for a home 
mortgage? Assuming you pay back the loan in 30 years, how 
could the difference in interest rates affect the total amount 
you will pay for your home?
3.	 What is the highest interest rate you found for a one-year cer-
tificate of deposit?
4.	 Based on your research, what is the difference between the 
highest rate and the lowest rate for a one-year CD? How 
could this affect the amount of money you would earn for the 
12-month period?
5.	 In a one- to two-page report, summarize what you have 
learned from this critical-thinking exercise.

Three years ago, Ron and Ginger were happy to learn that, upon 
graduation, Ron would be teaching history in a large high school, 
making $35,000 a year, and Ginger would be working in a public 
accounting firm, starting at $38,000. They married immediately 
after graduation and bought a new home for $110,000. Since 
Ron had no personal savings, Ginger used her savings for the 
down payment. They soon began furnishing their home, charging 
their purchases to three separate credit cards, and that is when 
their debt began to mount. When the three credit cards reached 
their $10,000 limits, Ron and Ginger signed up for one additional 
credit card with a $10,000 limit. Soon all their monthly pay-
ments were more than their combined take-home pay. To make 
their monthly payments, Ron and Ginger began to obtain cash 
advances on their credit cards. When they reached the credit ceil-
ings on their four credit cards, they could no longer get the cash 
advances they needed to cover their monthly bills. Stress began 
to mount as creditors called and demanded payment. Ron and 
Ginger began to argue over money and just about everything 
else. Finally, things got so bad they considered filing for personal 
bankruptcy; ironically, they could not afford the legal fees. What 
options are available to this couple?
Assignment
1.	 Working in teams of three or four, use your local library,  
the Internet, and personal interviews to investigate the  
following:
a.	 Filing for personal bankruptcy.
●
●What is involved in filing for personal bankruptcy?
●
●How much does it cost?
●
●How does bankruptcy affect individuals?
b.	 Review the Money Management International Web site at
www.cccsintl.org.
●
●What services does this organization provide?
●
●How might this organization help Ron and Ginger?
●
●What will it cost?
2.	 Prepare a specific plan for repaying Ron and Ginger’s debt.
3.	 Outline the advantages and disadvantages of credit cards, 
and make the appropriate recommendations for Ron and 
Ginger concerning their future use of credit cards.
4.	 Summarize what you have learned about credit card misuse.
5 	RESEARCHING DIFFERENT CAREERS
It has long been known that maintaining a good credit record is 
essential to obtaining loans from financial institutions, but did 
you know that employers often check credit records before offer-
ing an applicant a position? This is especially true of firms that 
handle financial accounts for others. Information contained in 
your credit report can tell an employer a lot about how respon-
sible you are with money and how well you manage it. Individuals 
have the right to know what is in their credit bureau files and to 
have the credit bureau verify any inaccurate, misleading, or vague

information. Before you apply for a job or a loan, you should 
check with a credit bureau to learn what is in your file.
Assignment
1.	 Using information in this chapter, use the Internet or call a 
credit bureau and ask for a copy of your credit report. A  
small fee may be required depending on the bureau and  
circumstances.
2.	 Review the information.
3.	 Have the bureau verify any information that you feel is inac-
curate, misleading, or vague.
4.	 If the verification shows that the information is correct,  
prepare a brief statement explaining your side of the dispute, 
and send it to the bureau.
5.	 Prepare a statement summarizing what the credit report says 
about you. Based on your credit report, would a firm hire you 
as its financial manager?

How J. M. Smucker Manages Its Money
With a name like Smucker, financial management has to be good. The company is named 
for its founder, Jerome Monroe Smucker, who began selling apple cider and apple butter 
in 1897. Today, the Smucker family continues to be involved in running the Orrville, Ohio, 
firm, which employs 4,500 people and rings up $4.8 billion in food sales every year. Its well-
known consumer brands include Smucker’s (jams and jellies), Jif (peanut butter), Martha 
White (baking mixes), and many more that provide tasty food products to customers in 
both the United States and the global marketplace. 
With an eye toward financing faster growth, the J. M. Smucker Co. first sold shares of 
its common stock to the public in 1959. In recent years, it has made a number of major 
acquisitions to diversify its product mix and expand its geographical reach. It bought Jif 
and Crisco from Procter & Gamble in 2002 and then acquired International Multifoods 
Corporation in 2004. In 2008, Smucker purchased Folgers, the largest U.S. coffee com-
pany, from parent Procter & Gamble. In 2011, it purchased Florida-based Rowland Coffee 
Roasters and folded its $110 million in annual revenues into the corporation’s finances. 
In 2012, the company completed its acquisition of Sara Lee’s Douwe Egberts liquid coffee 
concentrate brand for wholesaling to restaurants and institutions. 
Multimillion-dollar acquisitions such as these require excellent financial management. 
For example, when Smucker bought Douwe Egberts from Sara Lee, it paid $350 million in 
cash when the deal closed and promised an additional $50 million in payments over the 
next ten years. The company had funds on hand for this and other acquisitions because it 
had arranged to borrow money by selling $400 million in bonds during 2010 and another 
$750 million in bonds during 2011. Although Smucker knew it would have to repay the 
money to bondholders in the future, it was able to take advantage of promising acquisition 
opportunities in the short term.
Some of the money is also being spent on investments that will take the company far 
beyond its Ohio roots. For instance, Smucker paid $35 million to buy a stake in Guilin 
Seamild Biologic Technology Development Company, a Chinese manufacturer of oatmeal 
products. “Seamild’s portfolio of quality, trusted products aligns with Smucker’s strategy 
of owning and marketing leading food brands,” says a Smucker official.1

Inside
Business
U
nfortunately, the J. M. Smucker Co. mentioned in this chapter’s opening Inside 
Business case was the exception when compared to many cash-strapped busi-
nesses that struggled to find the funds they needed to operate during the recent 
economic crisis. In fact, the crisis was a wake-up call for most corporate executives, 
managers, and business owners because one factor became obvious. The ability to bor-
row money (debt capital) or obtain money from the owners of a business (equity capi-
tal) is necessary for the efficient operation of a business firm and our economic system. 
In this chapter we examine why financial management is important in an uncertain 
economy. Then, we discuss how firms find the financing required to meet two needs 
of all business organizations: the need for money to start a business and keep it going, 
and the need to manage that money effectively. We also look at how firms develop 
financial plans and evaluate financial performance. Then we compare various methods 
of obtaining short-term and long-term financing.

Part 7   Finance and Investment
Why Financial Management?
Question: How important is financial management for a business firm? 
To answer that question, consider the recent financial problems of the “Big Three” 
U.S. automakers. Both General Motors and Chrysler filed for bankruptcy protection 
during the recent economic crisis, but Ford had the financial fuel to keep going, despite 
sagging sales and worldwide economic turmoil. Executives at Ford used aggressive 
financial planning to anticipate the automaker’s need for financing. To avoid the same 
fate as General Motors and Chrysler—bankruptcy—Ford’s financial managers bor-
rowed money in anticipation of a downturn in the company’s sales and profits. Ford 
also sold both stocks and bonds to raise the money it needed to keep the company 
operating during the crisis and even build for the future. Did that financial plan work? 
The answer: A definite yes! Today, Ford is selling more cars, developing environmen-
tally friendly engines, creating concept cars for the future, and has returned to profit-
ability. Although there are many factors that account for Ford’s success, most experts 
agree that the firm’s financial planning enabled it to weather the economic storm and 
build for the future.
Although most managers and employees have been affected by the economic crisis, 
the years since the end of 2007 have been especially difficult for financial managers. 
After all, they are the ones that must be able to raise the money needed to pay bills 
and expenses to keep a company’s doors open. During the recent economic crisis, 
many financial managers and business owners found it was increasingly difficult to use 
many of the traditional sources of short- and long-term financing described later in this 
chapter. In some cases, banks stopped making loans even to companies that had always 
been able to borrow money. For example, both GE and AT&T—two premier names 
in corporate America—could not get the financing they needed.2 Furthermore, the 
number of corporations selling stock for the first time to the general public decreased 
because investors were afraid to invest in new companies. The worst-case scenario: 
There was an increase in the number of businesses that filed for bankruptcy during the 
crisis, as illustrated in Figure 19.1. Fortunately, there were many more business firms 
that were able to weather the economic storm and keep operating because of their 
ability to manage their finances. And now that the nation’s economy is improving, the 
number of bankruptcies is beginning to decline. 
The Need for Financial Management
Financial management consists of all the activities concerned with 
obtaining money and using it effectively. To some extent, financial 
management can be viewed as a two-sided problem. On one 
side, the uses of funds often dictate the type or types of financing 
needed by a business. On the other side, the activities a business 
can undertake are determined by the types of financing available. 
Financial managers must ensure that funds are available when 
needed, that they are obtained at the lowest possible cost, and that 
they are used as efficiently as possible. In addition, proper financial 
management must also ensure that:
●
●Financing priorities are established in line with organizational 
goals and objectives.
●
●Spending is planned and controlled.
●
●Sufficient financing is available when it is needed, both now and 
in the future.
●
●A firm’s credit customers pay their bills on time, and the number 
of past due accounts is reduced.
●
●Bills are paid promptly to protect the firm’s credit rating and its 
ability to borrow money.

How do managers decide how much inventory 
is needed? One of the most perplexing problems 
financial managers must deal with is the amount of 
inventory a retail store needs. If a retailer has too 
much inventory, then too much money is tied up in 
merchandise that is not selling. If a retailer has too 
little inventory, it may not have enough merchandise to 
meet consumer demand.

●The funds required for paying the firm’s taxes are available when needed to meet 
tax deadlines.
●
●Excess cash is invested in certificates of deposit (CDs), government securities, or 
conservative, marketable securities.
Financial Reform After the Economic Crisis 
The job of financial managers became a bit easier as the economy stabilized. Still, it 
became apparent that something needed to be done to stabilize the financial system 
and prevent future economic meltdowns. In the wake of the crisis that affected both 
business firms and individuals, a cry for more regulations and reforms became a high 
priority. To meet this need, President Obama signed the Dodd–Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act into law on July 21, 2010. Even with the new 
regulations, some experts say the law did not go far enough while others argue it went 
too far. Although the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives debate additional 
regulations, the goals are to hold Wall Street firms accountable for their actions, end 
taxpayer bailouts, tighten regulations for major financial firms, and increase government 
oversight. There has also been debate about limiting the amount of executive pay 
and bonuses, limiting the size of the largest financial firms, and curbing speculative 
investment techniques that were used by banks before the crisis. 
As mentioned in Chapter 18, new regulations will protect American families from 
unfair, abusive financial and banking practices. For business firms, the impact of new 
regulations could increase the time and cost of obtaining both short- and long-term 
financing. 
Careers in Finance
After reading the material in the last section, you might be thinking why anyone would 
want a job in finance. And yet, a career in finance can be rewarding. As an added 
bonus, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects there will be an 8 percent increase in the 
number of jobs in the financial sector of the economy between now and 2018.3 
Today, there are many different types of positions in finance. At the executive level, 
most large business firms have a chief financial officer for financial management. A 
chief financial officer (CFO) is a high-level corporate executive who manages a firm’s 
finances and reports directly to the company’s chief executive officer or president. 
Some firms prefer to use the titles vice president of financial management, treasurer, 
or controller instead of the CFO title for executive-level positions in the finance area.
Although some executives in finance do make $300,000 a year or more, many 
entry-level and lower-level positions that pay quite a bit less are available. Banks, 
The number of businesses that filed for bankruptcy increased during the economic crisis.

complete statistics were available.)

insurance companies, and investment firms obviously have a need 
for workers who can manage and analyze financial data. So do 
businesses involved in manufacturing, services, and marketing. 
Colleges and universities, not-for-profit organizations, and govern-
ment entities at all levels also need finance workers.
People in finance must have certain traits and skills. One of 
the most important priorities for someone interested in a finance 
career is honesty. Be warned: Investors, lenders, and other corpo-
rate executives expect financial managers to be above reproach. 
Moreover, both federal and state government entities have enacted 
legislation to ensure that corporate financial statements reflect the 
“real” status of a firm’s financial position. In addition to honesty, 
managers and employees in the finance area must:
	 1.	Have a strong background in accounting or mathematics.
	 2.	Know how to use a computer to analyze data.
	 3.	Be an expert at both written and oral communication.
Typical job titles in finance include bank officer, consumer 
credit officer, financial analyst, financial planner, loan officer, 
insurance analyst, and investment account executive. Depending 
on qualifications, work experience, and education, starting 
salaries generally begin at $25,000 to $35,000 a year, but it is not 
uncommon for college graduates to earn higher salaries. In addition 
to salary, many employees have attractive benefits and other perks that make a career 
in financial management attractive.
The Need for Financing
Money is needed both to start a business and to keep it going. The original investment 
of the owners, along with money they may have borrowed, should be enough to open 
the doors. After that, ideally sales revenues should be used to pay the firm’s expenses 
and provide a profit as well.
This is exactly what happens in a successful firm—over the long run. However, 
income and expenses may vary from month to month or from year to year. Temporary 
financing may be needed when expenses are high or sales are low. Then, too, situations 
such as the opportunity to purchase a new facility or expand an existing plant may 
require more money than is currently available within a firm.
Short-Term Financing 
Short-term financing is money that will be used for one year or less. As illustrated 
in Table 19.1, there are many short-term financing needs, but three deserve special

attention. First, certain business practices may affect a firm’s cash 
flow and create a need for short-term financing. Cash flow is the 
movement of money into and out of an organization. The goal is 
to have sufficient money coming into the firm in any period to 
cover the firm’s expenses during that period. This goal, however, is 
not always achieved. For example, California-based Callaway Golf 
offers credit to retailers and wholesalers that carry the firm’s golf 
clubs, balls, clothing, and golf accessories. Credit purchases made 
by Callaway’s retailers generally are not paid until 30 to 60 days 
(or more) after the transaction. Callaway therefore may need short-
term financing to pay its bills until its customers have paid theirs.
A second major need for short-term financing is speculative pro-
duction. Speculative production refers to the time lag between the 
actual production of goods and when the goods are sold. Consider 
what happens when a firm such as Connecticut-based Stanley Black 
& Decker begins to manufacture electric tools and small appli-
ances for sale during the Christmas season. Manufacturing begins 
in February, March, and April, and the firm negotiates short-term 
financing to buy materials and supplies, to pay wages and rent, 
and to cover inventory costs until its products eventually are sold 
to wholesalers and retailers later in the year. Take a look at Fig-
ure 19.2. Although Stanley Black & Decker manufactures and sells 
finished products all during the year, expenses peak during the 
first part of the year. During this same period, sales revenues are 
low. Once the firm’s finished products are shipped to retailers and 
wholesalers and payment is received (usually within 30 to 60 days), 
sales revenues are used to repay short-term financing.
A third need for short-term financing is to increase inventory. Retailers that range 
in size from Walmart to the neighborhood drugstore need short-term financing to 
build up their inventories before peak selling periods. For example, Dallas-based Bruce 
Miller Nurseries must increase the number of shrubs, trees, and flowering plants that 
it makes available for sale during the spring and summer growing seasons. To obtain 
this merchandise inventory from growers or wholesalers, it uses short-term financing 
and repays the loans when the merchandise is sold. 
Manufacturers such as Stanley Black & Decker often use short-term financing  
to pay expenses during the production process. Once goods are shipped to 
retailers and wholesalers and payment is received, sales revenues are used  
to repay short-term financing.

Business success often begins with a financial 
plan. Before the merchandise in this IKEA warehouse 
can be sold, it must be purchased from manufacturers 
or suppliers and then stored until it is needed in 
the retailer’s stores. Successful businesses often use 
sound financial planning built on the firm’s goals and 
objectives, different types of budgets, and available 
sources of funds to make sure financing is available 
to purchase inventory and other necessities needed to 
operate a business.

Part 7   Finance and Investment
Long-Term Financing 
Long-term financing is money that will be used for 
longer than one year. Long-term financing obviously is 
needed to start a new business. As Table 19.1 shows, 
it is also needed for business mergers and acquisitions, 
new product development, long-term marketing 
activities, replacement of equipment that has become 
obsolete, and expansion of facilities.
The amounts of long-term financing needed by 
large firms can seem almost unreal. The 3M Company—a 
large multinational corporation known for research and 
development—has invested more than $7 billion over the last 
five years to develop new products designed to make people’s 
lives easier and safer.4
The Risk–Return Ratio 
According to financial experts, business firms will find it more 
difficult to raise both short- and long-term financing in the 
future for two reasons. First, financial reform and increased 
regulations will lengthen the process required to obtain 
financing. Second, both lenders and investors are more cautious 
about who receives financing. As a result of these two factors, 
financial managers must develop a strong financial plan that 
describes how the money will be used and how it will be repaid. 
When developing a financial plan for a business, a financial 
manager must also consider the risk–return ratio when making 
decisions that affect the firm’s finances.
The risk–return ratio is based on the principle that a high-
risk decision should generate higher financial returns for a busi-
ness. On the other hand, more conservative decisions (with less 
risk) often generate lesser returns. Although financial manag-
ers want higher returns, they often must strive for a balance 
between risk and return. For example, Ohio-based American 
Electric Power may consider investing millions of dollars to fund research into new 
solar technology that could enable the company to use the sun to generate electrical 
power. Yet, financial managers (along with other managers throughout the organiza-
tion) must determine the potential return before committing to such a costly research 
project.
Planning—The Basis of Sound 
Financial Management
In Chapter 6, we defined a plan as an outline of the actions by which an organization 
intends to accomplish its goals and objectives. A financial plan, then, is a plan for 
obtaining and using the money needed to implement an organization’s goals and 
objectives.
Developing the Financial Plan
Financial planning (like all planning) begins with establishing a set of valid goals and 
objectives. Financial managers must then determine how much money is needed to 
accomplish each goal and objective. Finally, financial managers must identify available 
sources of financing and decide which to use. The three steps involved in financial 
planning are illustrated in Figure 19.3.

budget  a financial statement that 
projects income, expenditures, or 
both over a specified future period
cash budget  a financial statement 
that estimates cash receipts and 
cash expenditures over a specified 
period
Establishing Organizational Goals and Objectives  As pointed out in 
Chapter 6, a goal is an end result that an organization expects to achieve over a 
one- to ten-year period. An objective was defined in Chapter 6 as a specific statement 
detailing what an organization intends to accomplish over a shorter period of time. If 
goals and objectives are not specific and measurable, they cannot be translated into 
dollar costs, and financial planning cannot proceed. For large corporations, both goals 
and objectives can be expensive. For example, have you ever wondered how much 
McDonald’s spends on advertising? Well, to reach the nearly 68 million customers it 
serves each day, the world’s most famous fast-food restaurant chain spends over $685 
million each year.5
Budgeting for Financial Needs  Once planners know what the firm’s goals and 
objectives are for a specific period—say, the next calendar year—they can construct a 
budget that projects the costs the firm will incur and the sales revenues it will receive. 
Specifically, a budget is a financial statement that projects income, expenditures, or 
both over a specified future period.
Usually, the budgeting process begins with the construction of departmental bud-
gets for sales and various types of expenses. Financial managers can easily combine 
each department’s budget for sales and expenses into a company-wide cash budget. 
A cash budget estimates cash receipts and cash expenditures over a specified period. 
Notice in the cash budget for Stars and Stripes Clothing, shown in Figure 19.4, sales 
receipts and collections are listed at the top for each calendar quarter. Payments for 
purchases and routine expenses are listed in the middle section. Using this information, 
it is possible to calculate the anticipated cash gain or loss at the end of each quarter 
for this retail clothing store.
Most firms today use one of two approaches to budgeting. In the traditional 
approach, each new budget is based on the dollar amounts contained in the budget for 
the preceding year. These amounts are modified to reflect any revised goals, and man-
agers are required to justify only new expenditures. The problem with this approach is 
that it leaves room for padding budget items to protect the (sometimes selfish) interests 
After a financial plan has been developed, it must be monitored continually to 
ensure that it actually fulfills the firm’s goals.

zero-base budgeting  a 
budgeting approach in which every 
expense in every budget must be 
justified
capital budget  a financial 
statement that estimates a firm’s 
expenditures for major assets and 
its long-term financing needs
equity capital  money received 
from the owners or from the 
sale of shares of ownership in a 
business
debt capital  borrowed money 
obtained through loans of various 
types
of the manager or his or her department. This problem is essentially eliminated through 
zero-base budgeting. Zero-base budgeting is a budgeting approach in which every 
expense in every budget must be justified.
To develop a plan for long-term financing needs, managers often construct a capi-
tal budget. A capital budget estimates a firm’s expenditures for major assets, including 
new product development, expansion of facilities, replacement of obsolete equipment, 
and mergers and acquisitions. For example, Berkshire Hathaway, a company known 
for purchasing well-managed and innovative companies, constructed a capital budget 
to determine the best way to finance the $9 billion acquisition of the highly successful 
Lubrizol Corporation in 2011.6
Identifying Sources of Funds  The four primary sources of funds, listed in 
Figure 19.3, are sales revenue, equity capital, debt capital, and proceeds from the sale 
of assets. Future sales revenue generally provides the greatest part of a firm’s financing. 
Figure 19.4 shows that for Stars and Stripes Clothing, sales for the year are expected to 
cover all expenses and to provide a cash gain of $106,000. However, Stars and Stripes 
has a problem in the first quarter, when sales are expected to fall short of expenses by 
$7,000. In fact, one of the primary reasons for financial planning is to provide manage-
ment with adequate lead time to solve this type of cash-flow problem.
A second type of funding is equity capital. For a sole proprietorship or partner-
ship, equity capital is provided by the owner or owners of the business. For a corpo-
ration, equity capital is money obtained from the sale of shares of ownership in the 
business. Equity capital is used almost exclusively for long-term financing. 
A third type of funding is debt capital, which is borrowed money. Debt capital 
may be borrowed for either short- or long-term use—and a short-term loan seems 
made to order for Stars and Stripes Clothing’s shortfall problem. The firm probably 
would borrow the needed $7,000 (or perhaps a bit more) at some point during the first 
quarter and repay it from second-quarter sales revenue.
Proceeds from the sale of assets are the fourth type of funding. Selling assets is 
a drastic step. However, it may be a reasonable last resort when sales revenues are 
declining and equity capital or debt capital cannot be found. Assets also may be sold to 
increase a firm’s cash balance or when they are no longer needed or do not “fit” with 
the company’s core business. In 2011, Pfizer, the world’s biggest drug maker, agreed 
A company-wide cash budget projects sales, collections, purchases, and expenses over a specified period to  
anticipate cash surpluses and deficits.

unsecured financing  financing 
that is not backed by collateral; 
unsecured short-term financing 
offers several options
to sell its Capsugel manufacturing unit to KKR (Kohlberg Kravis 
Roberts), a world leading investment company, for $2.4 billion. The 
cash Pfizer receives from the Capsugel sale will be used to repur-
chase shares of its own stock.7
Monitoring and Evaluating 
Financial Performance
It is important to ensure that financial plans are implemented 
properly and to catch potential problems before they become major 
ones. Despite efforts to raise additional financing, reduce expenses, 
and increase sales to become profitable, retail and online bookseller 
Borders filed for bankruptcy protection in 2011. Eventually, the 
firm was forced to liquidate its inventory and close all its stores 
because a buyer could not be found for the bankrupt firm. 
To prevent such problems, financial managers should estab-
lish a means of monitoring financial performance. Interim budgets 
(weekly, monthly, or quarterly) may be prepared for comparison 
purposes. These comparisons point up areas that require additional 
or revised planning—or at least areas calling for a more careful 
investigation. Budget comparisons can also be used to improve the 
firm’s future budgets.
Sources of Short-Term  
Debt Financing
Typically, short-term debt financing is money that will be repaid in one year or less. 
During the economic crisis, many business firms found that it was much more difficult 
to borrow money for short periods of time to purchase inventory, buy supplies, pay 
salaries, and meet everyday expenses. Today the amount of available short-term 
financing has increased. 
The decision to borrow money does not necessarily mean that a firm is in finan-
cial trouble. On the contrary, astute financial management often means regular, 
responsible borrowing of many different kinds to meet different needs. In this sec-
tion, we examine the sources of short-term debt financing available to businesses. 
In the next two sections, we look at long-term financing options: equity capital and 
debt capital.
Sources of Unsecured Short-Term Financing
Short-term debt financing is usually easier to obtain than long-term debt financing for 
three reasons:
	 1.	For the lender, the shorter repayment period means less risk of non-payment.
	 2.	The dollar amounts of short-term loans are usually smaller than those of long-term 
loans.
	 3.	A close working relationship normally exists between the short-term borrower and 
the lender.
Most lenders do not require collateral for short-term financing. If they do, it is usu-
ally because they are concerned about the size of a particular loan, the borrowing firm’s 
poor credit rating, or the general prospects of repayment. Remember from Chapter 18 
that collateral was defined as real estate or property pledged as security for a loan.
Unsecured financing is financing that is not backed by collateral. A company 
seeking unsecured short-term financing has several options.
Describe the advantages and 
disadvantages of different 
methods of short-term debt 
financing.

Borders bookstores—no more! After 40 years, 
Borders closed all of its stores. The firm filed for 
bankruptcy in early 2011 and was forced to close a 
large number of stores in order to reorganize. Then 
in the summer of 2011, the bookseller was forced to 
liquidate its inventory and remaining stores despite 
revised financial plans, new financial goals, and its 
reorganizational efforts. Simply put: A buyer could not 
be found for the bankrupt firm.

Part 7   Finance and Investment
trade credit  a type of short-term 
financing extended by a seller 
who does not require immediate 
payment after delivery of 
merchandise
promissory note  a written pledge 
by a borrower to pay a certain 
sum of money to a creditor at a 
specified future date
prime interest rate   the lowest 
rate charged by a bank for a short-
term loan
Trade Credit  Manufacturers and wholesalers often provide 
financial aid to retailers by allowing them 30 to 60 days (or more) 
in which to pay for merchandise. This delayed payment, known 
as trade credit, is a type of short-term financing extended by a 
seller who does not require immediate payment after delivery of 
merchandise. It is the most popular form of short-term financing, 
because most manufacturers and wholesalers do not charge interest 
for trade credit. In fact, from 70 to 90 percent of all transactions 
between businesses involve some trade credit.
Let us assume that Discount Tire Stores receives a shipment 
of tires from a manufacturer. Along with the merchandise, the 
manufacturer sends an invoice that states the terms of payment. 
Discount Tire now has two options for payment. First, the retailer 
may pay the invoice promptly and take advantage of any cash 
discount the manufacturer offers. Cash-discount terms are speci-
fied on the invoice. For instance, “2/10, net 30” means that the 
customer—Discount Tire—may take a “2” percent discount if it 
pays the invoice within ten days of the invoice date. Let us assume 
that the dollar amount of the invoice is $200,000. In this case, the 
cash discount is $4,000 ($200,000 3 0.02 5 $4,000). If the cash 
discount is taken, Discount Tire only has to pay the manufacturer 
$196,000 ($200,000 2 $4,000 5 $196,000).
A second option is to wait until the end of the credit period 
before making payment. If payment is made between 11 and 30 days after the date of 
the invoice, Discount Tire must pay the entire amount. As long as payment is made 
before the end of the credit period, the retailer maintains the ability to purchase addi-
tional merchandise using the trade-credit arrangement.
Promissory Notes Issued to Suppliers  A promissory note is a written pledge 
by a borrower to pay a certain sum of money to a creditor at a specified future date. 
Suppliers uneasy about extending trade credit may be less reluctant to offer credit to 
customers who sign promissory notes. Unlike trade credit, however, promissory notes 
usually require the borrower to pay interest. Although repayment periods may extend 
to one year, most short-term promissory notes are repaid in 60 to 180 days.
A promissory note offers two important advantages to the firm extending the 
credit.
	 1.	A promissory note is legally binding and an enforceable contract.
	 2.	A promissory note is a negotiable instrument.
Because a promissory note is negotiable, the manufacturer, wholesaler, or company 
extending credit may be able to discount, or sell, the note to its own bank. If the note 
is discounted, the dollar amount received by the company extending credit is slightly 
less than the maturity value because the bank charges a fee for the service. The supplier 
recoups most of its money immediately, and the bank collects the maturity value when 
the note matures.
Unsecured Bank Loans  Banks and other financial institutions offer unsecured 
short-term loans to businesses at interest rates that vary with each borrower’s credit 
rating. The prime interest rate is the lowest rate charged by a bank for a short-term 
loan. Figure 19.5 traces the fluctuations in the average prime rate charged by U.S. 
banks from 1990 to January 2012. This lowest rate generally is reserved for large cor-
porations with excellent credit ratings. Organizations with good to high credit ratings 
may pay the prime rate plus “2” percent. Firms with questionable credit ratings may 
have to pay the prime rate plus “4” percent. (The fact that a banker charges a higher 
interest rate for a higher-risk loan is a practical application of the risk–return ratio

Entrepreneurs can always use more capital. Even 
though Body Rest Mattress Company in St. Petersburg, 
Florida was successful, Carl and Emma Calhoun found 
that obtaining short-term financing was difficult during 
the economic crisis. Traditional sources of financing—
banks and other financial institutions—tightened the 
requirements for obtaining unsecured loans or in many 
cases rejected loan requests.

discussed earlier in this chapter.) Of course, if the banker believes that loan repayment 
may be a problem, the borrower’s loan application may well be rejected.
When a business obtains a short-term bank loan, interest rates and repayment 
terms may be negotiated. As a condition of the loan, a bank may require that a com-
pensating balance be kept on deposit at the bank. Compensating balances, if required, 
are typically 10 to 20 percent of the borrowed funds. The bank may also require that 
every commercial borrower clean up (pay off completely) its short-term loans at least 
once each year and not use it again for a period of 30 to 60 days.
Commercial Paper  Large firms with excellent credit reputations like Microsoft, 
Procter & Gamble, and Caterpillar can raise large sums of money quickly by issuing 
commercial paper. As defined in Chapter 18, commercial paper is a short-term prom-
issory note issued by a large corporation. The maturity date for commercial paper is 
normally 270 days or less. 
Commercial paper is secured only by the reputation of the issuing firm; no col-
lateral is involved. The interest rate a corporation pays when it sells commercial paper 
is tied to its credit rating and its ability to repay the commercial paper. In most cases, 
corporations selling commercial paper pay interest rates slightly below the interest 
rates charged by banks for short-term loans. Thus, selling commercial paper is cheaper 
than getting short-term financing from a bank.
Although it is possible to purchase commercial paper in smaller denomina-
tions, larger amounts—$100,000 or more—are quite common. Money obtained by 
selling commercial paper is most often used to purchase inventory, finance a firm’s 
accounts receivables, pay salaries and other necessary expenses, and solve cash-flow 
problems.
Sources of Secured Short-Term Financing
If a business cannot obtain enough money through unsecured financing, it must put 
up collateral to obtain additional short-term financing. Almost any asset can serve as 
collateral. However, inventories and accounts receivable are the assets most commonly 
pledged for short-term financing. Even when it is willing to pledge collateral to back up 
a loan, a firm that is financially weak may have difficulty obtaining short-term financing.
The prime rate is the interest rate charged by U.S. banks when businesses  
with the “best” credit ratings borrow money. All other businesses  
pay higher interest rates than the prime rate.

Part 7   Finance and Investment
factor  a firm that specializes 
in buying other firms’ accounts 
receivable
Loans Secured by Inventory  Normally, manufacturers, wholesalers, and retail-
ers have large amounts of money invested in finished goods. In addition, manu-
facturers carry raw materials and work-in-process inventories. All three types of 
inventory may be pledged as collateral for short-term loans. However, lenders 
prefer the much more salable finished merchandise to raw materials or work-in-
process inventories.
A lender may insist that inventory used as collateral be stored in a public ware-
house. In such a case, the receipt issued by the warehouse is retained by the lender. 
Without this receipt, the public warehouse will not release the merchandise. The lender 
releases the warehouse receipt—and the merchandise—to the borrower when the bor-
rowed money is repaid. In addition to paying the interest on the loan, the borrower 
must pay for storage in the public warehouse. As a result, this type of loan is more 
expensive than an unsecured short-term loan.
Loans Secured by Receivables  As defined in Chapter 17, accounts receiv-
able are amounts owed to a firm by its customers. A firm can pledge its accounts 
receivable as collateral to obtain short-term financing. A lender may advance 70 
to 80 percent of the dollar amount of the receivables. First, however, it conducts 
a thorough investigation to determine the quality of the receivables. (The quality 
of the receivables is the credit standing of the firm’s customers, coupled with the 
customers’ ability to repay their credit obligations when they are due.) If a favor-
able determination is made, the loan is approved. When the borrowing firm collects 
from a customer whose account has been pledged as collateral, generally it must 
turn the money over to the lender as partial repayment of the loan. An alternative 
approach is to notify the borrowing firm’s credit customers to make their payments 
directly to the lender.
Factoring Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable may be used in one other way to help raise short-term financing: 
They can be sold to a factoring company (or factor). A factor is a firm that specializes 
in buying other firms’ accounts receivable. The factor buys the accounts receivable for 
less than their face value; however, it collects the full dollar amount when each account 
is due. The factor’s profit thus is the difference between the face value of the accounts 
receivable and the amount the factor has paid for them. Generally, the amount of 
profit the factor receives is based on the risk the factor assumes. Risk, in this case, is 
the probability that the accounts receivable will not be repaid when they mature. In 
the aftermath of the economic crisis and because of the reluctance of some banks to 
provide short-term financing, some large financial firms, including CIT Group and GE 
Capital, are providing additional factoring services to both old and new firms that sell 
their accounts receivables.8
Even though the firm selling its accounts receivable gets less than face value, it does 
receive needed cash immediately. Moreover, it has shifted both the task of collecting 
and the risk of non-payment to the factor, which now owns the accounts receivable. 
Generally, customers whose accounts receivable have been factored are given instruc-
tions to make their payments directly to the factor.
Cost Comparisons
Table 19.2 compares the various types of short-term financing. As you can see, trade 
credit is the least expensive. Factoring of accounts receivable is typically the highest-
cost method shown.
For many purposes, short-term financing suits a firm’s needs perfectly. At other 
times, however, long-term financing may be more appropriate. In this case, a business 
may try to raise equity capital or long-term debt capital.

Sources of Equity Financing
Sources of long-term financing vary with the size and type of business. As mentioned 
earlier, a sole proprietorship or partnership acquires equity capital (sometimes referred 
to as owners’ equity) when the owner or partners invest money in the business. For 
corporations, equity-financing options include the sale of stock and the use of profits 
not distributed to owners. All three types of businesses can also obtain venture capital 
and use long-term debt capital (borrowed money) to meet their financial needs. 
Selling Stock
Some equity capital is used to start every business—sole 
proprietorship, partnership, or corporation. In the case of 
corporations, stockholders who buy shares in the company provide 
equity capital.
Initial Public Offering and the Primary Market  An initial 
public offering (IPO) occurs when a corporation sells common 
stock to the general public for the first time. To raise money, the 
social networking site Groupon used a 2011 IPO to raise $700 mil-
lion that it could use to fund expansion and other business activi-
ties.9 In another 2011 IPO, LinkedIn—one of the world’s largest 
social media companies—raised over $350 million.10 In mid-2012, 
Facebook used an IPO to raise capital, and it was one of the largest 
IPOs in recent history. And at the time of the publication of your 
text, there are more social media and technology IPOs planned 
for 2012. Corporations in other industries also use IPOs to raise 
money. In fact, as illustrated in Figure 19.6, the largest IPOs—Visa, 
General Motors, AT&T Wireless, Kraft Foods, and United Parcel 
Service—for U.S. companies involve companies from a number of 
different industries.

Just a piece of paper—or is it?  In fact, a piece of 
paper can be worth a lot of money when it is a stock 
certificate. A corporation sells stock to raise needed 
financing for expansion and to pay for other long-term 
financial needs. On the other hand, investors purchase 
stock because they can profit from their investment 
if the price of the corporation’s stock increases and a 
corporation pays dividends.

financial securities (via an

issuer of those securities

Established companies that plan to raise capital by selling sub-
sidiaries to the public can also use IPOs. In 2011, Sunoco sold 
shares in its metallurgical division and raised over $185 million. 
The new corporation—SunCoke Energy—will be a separate com-
pany and will produce metallurgical coke—a necessary compo-
nent for manufacturing steel. Monies from the IPO will be used to 
increase the parent company’s cash balance and provide funding 
for growth opportunities and expansion.11 In addition to using an 
IPO to increase the cash balance for the parent company, corpo-
rations often sell shares in a subsidiary when shares can be sold 
at a profit or when the subsidiary no longer fits with its current 
business plan. Finally, some corporations will sell a subsidiary that 
is growing more slowly than the rest of the company’s operating 
divisions.
When a corporation uses an IPO to raise capital, the stock is 
sold in the primary market. The primary market is a market in 
which an investor purchases financial securities (via an investment 
bank) directly from the issuer of the securities. An investment 
banking firm is an organization that assists corporations in rais-
ing funds, usually by helping to sell new issues of stocks, bonds, or 
other financial securities. 
Although a corporation can have only one IPO, it can sell addi-
tional stock after the IPO, assuming that there is a market for the 
company’s stock. Even though the cost of selling stock (often referred to as flotation 
costs) is high, the ongoing costs associated with this type of equity financing are low 
for two reasons. First, the corporation does not have to repay money obtained from 
the sale of stock because the corporation is under no legal obligation to do so. If you 
purchase corporate stock and later decide to sell your stock, you may sell it to another 
investor—not the corporation.
A second advantage of selling stock is that a corporation is under no legal obli-
gation to pay dividends to stockholders. As noted in Chapter 4, a dividend is a dis-
tribution of earnings to the stockholders of a corporation. For any reason (e.g., if a 
company has a bad year), the board of directors can vote to omit dividend payments. 
Earnings then are retained for use in funding business operations. Of course, corporate 
management may hear from unhappy stockholders if expected dividends are omitted 
too frequently.

The Secondary Market  Although a share of corporate stock is only sold one time in 
the primary market, the stock can be sold again and again in the secondary market. The 
secondary market is a market for existing financial securities that are traded between 
investors. Although a corporation does not receive money each time its stock is bought 
or sold in the secondary market, the ability to obtain cash by selling stock investments 
is one reason why investors purchase corporate stock. Without the secondary market, 
investors would not purchase stock in the primary market because there would be no 
way to sell shares to other investors. Usually, secondary-market transactions are com-
pleted through a securities exchange or the over-the-counter (OTC) market.
A securities exchange is a marketplace where member brokers meet to buy and 
sell securities. Generally, securities issued by larger corporations are traded at the New 
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) (now owned by the NYSE Euronext holding company), 
or at regional exchanges located in different parts of the country. The securities of 
very large corporations may be traded at more than one of these exchanges. Securities 
of firms also may be listed on foreign securities exchanges—in Tokyo or London, for 
example.
Stocks issued by several thousand companies are traded in the OTC market. The 
over-the-counter (OTC) market is a network of dealers who buy and sell the stocks 
of corporations that are not listed on a securities exchange. The term over-the-counter 
was coined more than 100 years ago when securities actually were sold “over the coun-
ter” in stores and banks. Most OTC securities today are traded through an electronic 
exchange called the Nasdaq (pronounced “nazzdack”). The term Nasdaq stands for 
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations. The Nasdaq is now 
one of the largest securities markets in the world. Today, the Nasdaq is known for 
its forward-looking, innovative, growth companies, including Intel, Microsoft, Cisco 
Systems, and Dell Computer.
There are two types of stock: common and preferred. Each type has advantages 
and drawbacks as a means of long-term financing.
Investor Relations in the Social Media Era
Going for
SUCCESS
© doorq/Shutterstock
Tweeting about earnings? Increasingly, public 
corporations are communicating with their 
investors via Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, 
LinkedIn, and other social media. Companies still 
publish annual reports (in print and online) and hold annual 
meetings (in person and via webcast). In addition, because 
stockholders and potential investors want easy access to the 
latest financial news, companies like Alcoa, Dell, and eBay 
now use social media to provide official updates. Although 
the timing and content of these messages must comply with 
regulatory requirements, the ability to connect quickly and 
directly with investors is vital at a time when rumors can fly 
around the world at the click of a mouse.
Alcoa, for example, uses its Facebook page to announce 
quarterly earnings figures and link to executive webcasts. It 
also uses its Twitter account to call attention to specific 
results and invite comments from its followers. For investors 
who want to dig deeper into quarterly or annual financial 
reports, the investor relations department shares its electronic 
presentations on SlideShare. 
Thanks to Twitter, YouTube, a dedicated investor relations 
blog, and other social media, Dell reaches more than five million 
people when it presents its quarterly financial results. And the 
online auction site eBay live-tweets earnings results as the 
CEO announces them. Watch for corporate investor relations 
departments to become even more social in the years ahead.

common stock  stock whose 
owners may vote on corporate 
matters but whose claims on 
profits and assets are subordinate 
to the claims of others
preferred stock  stock whose 
owners usually do not have 
voting rights but whose claims 
on dividends and assets are paid 
before those of common-stock 
owners
retained earnings  the portion 
of a corporation’s profits not 
distributed to stockholders
Common Stock  A share of common stock repre-
sents the most basic form of corporate ownership. In 
return for the financing provided by selling common 
stock, management must make certain concessions to 
stockholders that may restrict or change corporate poli-
cies. Every corporation must hold an annual meeting, 
at which the holders of common stock may vote for the 
board of directors. Often, stockholders are also asked 
to approve or disapprove of major corporate actions by 
voting on the following: 
	 1.	 Amendments to the corporate charter or corporate by-laws
	 2.	 Sale of certain assets
	 3.	 Mergers and acquisitions
	 4.	 New issues of preferred stock or bonds
	 5.	 Changes in the amount of common stock issued
	
Few investors will buy common stock unless they believe 
that their investment will increase in value. Information on the 
reasons why investors purchase stocks and how to evaluate 
stock investments is provided in Chapter 20, “Understanding 
Personal Finances and Investments.”
Preferred Stock  As noted in Chapter 4, the owners of 
preferred stock must receive their dividends before holders 
of common stock receive theirs. Also, preferred stockholders 
know the dollar amount of their dividend because it is stated 
on the stock certificate. When compared to common stockhold-
ers, preferred stockholders also have first claim (after creditors) 
on assets if the corporation is dissolved or declares bankruptcy. 
Even so, as with common stock, the board of directors must 
approve dividends on preferred stock, and this type of financ-
ing does not represent a debt that must be legally repaid. In 
return for preferential treatment, preferred stockholders gener-
ally give up the right to vote at a corporation’s annual meeting.
Although a corporation usually issues only one type of 
common stock, it may issue many types of preferred stock 
with varying dividends or dividend rates. For example, New York–based Consolidated 
Edison has one common-stock issue but three preferred-stock issues.
Retained Earnings
Most large corporations distribute only a portion of their after-tax earnings to 
stockholders. The portion of a corporation’s profits not distributed to stockholders is 
called retained earnings. Because they are undistributed profits, retained earnings are 
considered a form of equity financing.
The amount of retained earnings in any year is determined by corporate manage-
ment and approved by the board of directors. Most small and growing corporations 
pay no cash dividend—or a very small dividend—to their stockholders. All or most 
earnings are reinvested in the business for research and development, expansion, or the 
funding of major projects. Reinvestment tends to increase the value of the firm’s stock 
while it provides essentially cost-free financing for the business. More mature corpo-
rations may distribute 40 to 60 percent of their after-tax profits as dividends. Utility 
companies and other corporations with very stable earnings often pay out as much 
as 80 to 90 percent of what they earn. For a large corporation, retained earnings can 
amount to a hefty bit of financing. For example, in 2011, the total amount of retained 
earnings for General Electric was over $137 billion.12

Talk to Chuck
Founded in 1971, the Charles Schwab Corporation 
is a brokerage firm and banking company with 
extensive product lines including checking accounts, 
mortgages, brokerage and retirement accounts, mutual 
funds, stocks and bonds, and more. 
While some financial service firms have been slow to 
adopt social media, due in part to the risk of violating 
the rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority 
(FINRA), Schwab has long been viewed as a leader in the 
use of social media. The Schwab promotional campaign 
“Talk to Chuck” invited investors to check out the company 
as an option to more traditional investment companies.

Venture Capital and Private Placements
To establish a new business or expand an existing one, an entrepreneur may try to obtain 
venture capital. In Chapter 5, we defined venture capital as money invested in small 
(and sometimes struggling) firms that have the potential to become very successful. 
Most venture capital firms do not invest in the typical small business—a neighborhood 
convenience store or a local dry cleaner—but in firms that have the 
potential to become extremely profitable. Today, most venture capital 
firms are investing in companies that build the nation’s infrastructure, 
develop computer software, or provide consumer information or 
social media services. For example, Zynga—the fast-growing company 
behind such popular games as FarmVille and Words with Friends—
received venture capital before selling stock to the public.13 
Generally, a venture capital firm consists of a pool of investors, a 
partnership established by a wealthy family, or a joint venture formed 
by corporations with money to invest. In return for financing, these 
investors generally receive an equity or ownership position in the busi-
ness and share in its profits. Venture capital firms vary in size and 
scope of interest. Some offer financing for start-up businesses, whereas 
others finance only established businesses. Although venture capital 
firms are willing to take chances, they have also been more selective 
about where they invest their money after the recent economic crisis.
Another method of raising capital is through a private place-
ment. A private placement occurs when stock and other corporate 
securities are sold directly to insurance companies, pension funds, or 
large institutional investors. When compared with selling stocks and 
other corporate securities to the public, there are often fewer gov-
ernment regulations and the cost is generally less when the securities 
are sold through a private placement. Typically, terms between the 
buyer and seller are negotiated when a private placement is used to 
raise capital.

One smart venture capitalist!  Venture capital 
firms make no secret of where they’re looking to 
invest, and these days they’re investing heavily 
in information technology. Venture capitalist, 
Marc Andreessen, is a partner in California-based 
Andreessen Horowitz—one of the best venture 
capitalist firms in the world. Since the venture 
capital firm was founded, his firm has invested 
money in many very recognizable and profitable 
firms including Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest.
Looking for Venture Capital from Corporations
Entrepreneurial
Success
© elnur/Shutterstock
Why would General Electric (GE), Dell, 
Google, and other major corporations set 
aside hundreds of millions of dollars as venture 
capital for small businesses? One reason is to work 
with entrepreneurs who have cutting-edge ideas. “It allows us 
to connect to these incredible, innovative companies,” explains 
a GE executive. With venture-capital partners, GE has invested 
in small businesses that are in the early stages of developing 
and commercializing environmentally friendly technology and 
products. 
Another reason is to identify potential partners that are 
active in fast-growing markets. Dell, for example, has reactivated 
its venture capital group and is planning investments in 
entrepreneurial firms that are working on software for business 
use and pushing the limits of cloud computing. Because Dell 
is diversifying beyond computer equipment, venture capital 
allows it to gain entry into emerging technology services. 
Finally, long-term profit drives corporations to make capital 
venture available. Google Ventures, the search company’s 
investment arm, provides money as well as assistance to 
technology entrepreneurs in a wide range of industries, 
including life sciences, energy, and digital entertainment. Google 
Ventures has already helped 70 businesses with recruiting, 
engineering, design, and marketing, with an eye toward future 
financial return. “When cash is a commodity, you need to do 
other things to show an entrepreneur how you’ll help them,” 
says the managing partner.

financial leverage  the use of 
borrowed funds to increase the 
return on owners’ equity
Sources of Long-Term Debt Financing
As pointed out earlier in this chapter, businesses borrow money on a short-term basis 
for many valid reasons other than desperation. There are equally valid reasons for long-
term borrowing. In addition to using borrowed money to meet the long-term needs 
listed in Table 19.1, successful businesses often use the financial leverage it creates to 
improve their financial performance. Financial leverage is the use of borrowed funds 
to increase the return on owners’ equity. The principle of financial leverage works as 
long as a firm’s earnings are larger than the interest charged for the borrowed money.
To understand how financial leverage can increase a firm’s return on owners’ 
equity, study the information for Texas-based Cypress Springs Plastics presented in 
Table 19.3. Pete Johnston, the owner of the firm, is trying to decide how best to finance 
a $100,000 purchase of new high-tech manufacturing equipment. 
●
●He could borrow the money and pay 7 percent annual interest. 
●
●He could invest an additional $100,000 in the firm. 
Assuming that the firm earns $95,000 a year and that annual interest for this loan 
totals $7,000 ($100,000 × 0.07 = $7,000), the return on owners’ equity for Cypress 
Springs Plastics would be higher if the firm borrowed the additional financing. 
Return on owners’ equity is determined by dividing a firm’s net income by the dollar 
amount of owners’ equity. Based on the calculations illustrated in Table 19.3, Cypress 
Springs Plastics’ return on owners’ equity equals 17.6 percent if Johnston borrows 
the additional $100,000. The firm’s return on owners’ equity would decrease to  
15.8 percent if Johnston invests an additional $100,000 in the business.
The most obvious danger when using financial leverage is that the firm’s earnings 
may be lower than expected. If this situation occurs, the fixed interest charge actually 
works to reduce or eliminate the return on owners’ equity. Of course, borrowed money 
eventually must be repaid. 
For a small business, long-term debt financing is generally limited to loans. Large 
corporations have the additional option of issuing corporate bonds.
Long-Term Loans
Many businesses satisfy their long-term financing needs, such as those listed in 
Table 19.1, with loans from commercial banks, insurance companies, pension funds, 
and other financial institutions. Manufacturers and suppliers of heavy machinery may 
also provide long-term debt financing by granting credit to their customers.

term-loan agreement  a 
promissory note that requires 
a borrower to repay a loan in 
monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or 
annual installments
corporate bond  a corporation’s 
written pledge that it will repay a 
specified amount of money with 
interest
Term-Loan Agreements  A term-loan agreement is a prom-
issory note that requires a borrower to repay a loan in monthly, 
quarterly, semiannual, or annual installments. Although repayment 
may be as long as 15 to 20 years, long-term business loans normally 
are repaid in 3 to 7 years.
Assume that Pete Johnston, the owner of Cypress Springs 
Plastics, decides to borrow $100,000 and take advantage of the 
principle of financial leverage illustrated in Table 19.3. Although 
the firm’s return on owners’ equity does increase, interest must be 
paid each year and, eventually, the loan must be repaid. To pay off 
a $100,000 loan over a three-year period with annual payments, 
Cypress Springs Plastics must pay $33,333 on the loan balance 
plus $7,000 annual interest, or a total of $40,333 the first year. 
Although the amount of interest decreases each year because of the 
previous year’s payment on the loan balance, annual payments of 
this amount are still a large commitment for a small firm such as 
Cypress Springs Plastics.
The interest rate and repayment terms for term loans often are 
based on factors such as the reasons for borrowing, the borrowing 
firm’s credit rating, and the value of collateral. Although long-term 
loans occasionally may be unsecured, the lender usually requires 
some type of collateral. Acceptable collateral includes real estate, 
stocks, bonds, equipment, or any asset with value. Lenders may 
also require that borrowers maintain a minimum amount of work-
ing capital. 
The Basics of Getting a Loan  According to many financial 
experts, preparation is the key when applying for a long-term busi-
ness loan. In reality, preparation begins before you ever apply for 
the loan. To begin the process, you should get to know potential 
lenders before requesting debt financing. Although there may be 
many potential lenders that can provide the money you need, the 
logical place to borrow money is where your business does its bank-
ing. This fact underscores the importance of maintaining adequate 
balances in the firm’s bank accounts. Before applying for a loan, 
you may also want to check your firm’s credit rating with a national 
credit bureau such as D&B (formerly known as Dun & Bradstreet).
Typically, business owners will be asked to fill out a loan application. In addition 
to the loan application, the lender will also want to see your current business plan. Be 
sure to explain what your business is, how much funding you require to accomplish 
your goals, and how the loan will be repaid. Most lenders insist that you submit cur-
rent financial statements that have been prepared by an independent certified public 
accountant. Then compile a list of references that includes your suppliers, other lend-
ers, or the professionals with whom you are associated. You may also be asked to dis-
cuss the loan request with a loan officer. Hopefully, your loan request will be approved. 
If not, try to determine why your loan request was rejected. Think back over the loan 
process and determine what you could do to improve your chances of getting a loan 
the next time you apply. 
Corporate Bonds
In addition to loans, large corporations may choose to issue bonds in denominations 
of $1,000 to $50,000. Although the usual face value for corporate bonds is $1,000, 
the total face value of all the bonds in an issue usually amounts to millions of dollars. 
In fact, one of the reasons why corporations sell bonds is so that they can borrow a 
lot of money from a lot of different bondholders and raise larger amounts of money 
than could be borrowed from one lender. A corporate bond is a corporation’s written

maturity date  the date on which a 
corporation is to repay borrowed 
money
registered bond  a bond registered 
in the owner’s name by the issuing 
company
debenture bond  a bond backed 
only by the reputation of the

issuing firm
convertible bond  a bond that 
can be exchanged, at the owner’s 
option, for a specified number 
of shares of the corporation’s 
common stock
pledge that it will repay a specified amount of money 
with interest. Interest rates for corporate bonds vary 
with the financial health of the company issuing the 
bond. Specific factors that increase or decrease the 
interest rate that a corporation must pay when it issues 
bonds include 
●
●The corporation’s ability to pay interest each year 
until maturity.
●
●The corporation’s ability to repay the bond at 
maturity. 
For bond investors, the interest rate on corporate bonds  
is an example of the risk–return ratio discussed earlier in  
this chapter. Simply put: Investors expect more interest if 
there is more risk with more speculative bond issues—see 
Figure 19.7.
The maturity date is the date on which the corporation is 
to repay the borrowed money. Today, most corporate bonds are 
registered bonds. A registered bond is a bond registered in the 
owner’s name by the issuing company. Many corporations do 
not issue actual bonds. Instead, the bonds are recorded electroni-
cally, and the specific details regarding the bond issue, along with 
the current owner’s name and address, are maintained by com-
puter. Computer entries are safer because they cannot be stolen, 
misplaced, or destroyed, and make it easier to transfer when a 
bond is sold. 
Until a bond’s maturity, a corporation pays interest to the bond owner at the stated 
rate. For example, owners of American & Foreign Power Company bonds that mature 
in 2030 receive 5 percent per year for each bond. For each $1,000 bond issued, the cor-
poration must pay bondholders $50 ($1,000 3 0.05 5 $50). Because interest for cor-
porate bonds is usually paid semiannually, the owner of an American & Foreign Power 
bond will receive a $25 payment every six months for each bond they own. On the 
maturity date, a registered owner will receive cash equaling the face value of the bond.
Types of Bonds  Corporate bonds are generally classified as debentures, mortgage 
bonds, or convertible bonds. Most corporate bonds are debenture bonds. A debenture 
bond is a bond backed only by the reputation of the issuing corporation. To make 
its bonds more appealing to investors, a corporation may issue mortgage bonds. A 
mortgage bond is a corporate bond secured by various assets of the issuing firm. 
Typical corporate assets that are used as collateral for a mortgage bond include real 
estate, machinery, and equipment that is not pledged as collateral for other debt obli-
gations. The corporation can also issue convertible bonds. A convertible bond can be

bond indenture  a legal document 
that details all the conditions 
relating to a bond issue
serial bonds  bonds of a single 
issue that mature on different 
dates
sinking fund  a sum of money to 
which deposits are made each year 
for the purpose of redeeming a 
bond issue
trustee  an individual or an 
independent firm that acts as a 
bond owner’s representative
exchanged, at the owner’s option, for a specified number of shares of the corporation’s 
common stock. An Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) bond that matures in 2015 is 
convertible: Each bond can be converted to 35.6125 shares of AMD common stock.14 
A corporation can gain in three ways by issuing convertible bonds. First, convertibles 
usually carry a lower interest rate than nonconvertible bonds. Second, the conversion 
feature attracts investors who are interested in the speculative gain that conversion to 
common stock may provide. Third, if the bondholder converts to common stock, the 
corporation no longer has to redeem the bond at maturity.
Repayment Provisions for Corporate Bonds  Maturity dates for bonds generally 
range from 10 to 30 years after the date of issue. Some bonds are callable before the 
maturity date; that is, a corporation can buy back, or redeem, them. For these bonds, 
the corporation may pay the bond owner a call premium. The amount of the call pre-
mium, if any, is specified, along with other provisions, in the bond indenture. The bond 
indenture is a legal document that details all the conditions relating to a bond issue.
Before deciding if bonds are the best way to obtain corporate financing, managers 
must determine if the company can afford to pay the interest on the corporate bonds. 
It should be obvious that the larger the bond issue, the higher the dollar amount of 
interest that must be paid each year. For example, assume that American Express issues 
bonds with a face value of $100 million. If the interest rate is 4.875 percent, the interest 
on this bond issue is $4,875,000 ($100 million 3 0.04875 5 $4,875,000) each year 
until the bonds are repaid. In addition, the American Express corporate bonds must all 
be redeemed for their face value ($100 million) at maturity. If the corporation defaults 
on (does not pay) either interest payments or repayment of the bond at maturity, own-
ers of bonds can force the firm into bankruptcy and their claims take precedence over 
the claims of both common and preferred stockholders.
A corporation may use one of three methods to ensure that it has sufficient funds 
available to redeem a bond issue. First, it can issue the bonds as serial bonds, which are 
bonds of a single issue that mature on different dates. For example, a company may use 
a 25-year $50 million bond issue to finance its expansion. None of the bonds mature 
during the first 15 years. Thereafter, 10 percent of the bonds mature each year until all 
the bonds are retired at the end of the 25th year. Second, the corporation can establish 
a sinking fund. A sinking fund is a sum of money to which deposits are made each 
year for the purpose of redeeming a bond issue. When Union Pacific Corporation sold 
a $275 million bond issue, the company agreed to contribute to a sinking fund until 
the bond’s maturity in the year 2025.15 Third, a corporation can pay off an old bond 
issue by selling new bonds. Although this may appear to perpetuate the corporation’s 
long-term debt, a number of utility companies and railroads use this repayment method.
A corporation that issues bonds must also appoint a trustee, an individual or an 
independent firm that acts as the bond owner’s representative. A trustee’s duties are 
handled most often by a commercial bank or other large financial institution. The cor-
poration must report to the trustee periodically regarding its ability to make interest pay-
ments and eventually redeem the bonds. In turn, the trustee transmits this information 
to the bond owners, along with its own evaluation of the corporation’s ability to pay.
Cost Comparisons
Table 19.4 compares some of the methods that can be used to obtain long-term equity 
and debt financing. Although the initial flotation cost of issuing stock is high, selling 
common stock is generally a popular option for most financial managers. Once the 
stock is sold and upfront costs are paid, the ongoing costs of using stock to finance 
a business are low. The type of long-term financing that generally has the highest 
ongoing costs is a long-term loan (debt).
To a great extent, firms are financed through the investments of individuals—
money that people have deposited in banks or have used to purchase stocks, mutual 
funds, and bonds. In Chapter 20, we look at how securities markets help people invest 
their money in business.

Inside
Business
More than a century after Jerome Monroe Smucker founded 
his company, Smucker family members are still making 
smart financial decisions. Going public in 1959 provided 
money for growth through investments in product devel-
opment and other activities. More recently, the firm issued 
corporate bonds during periods when interest rates were 
low, keeping long-term borrowing costs low while build-
ing Smucker’s cash position so that it could make timely 
acquisitions whenever it spotted good opportunities. 
	
Looking ahead to expansion in China, Smucker 
has made an equity investment in a leading local oatmeal 
company. What Smucker learns from this company’s 
knowledge of the market will pave the way for higher 
sales of its North American products in Asia, as well as the 
­possibility of developing and manufacturing new foods 
specifically for China.
Questions
1.	 Why would Smucker prefer to issue more than  
$1 billion in bonds over 18 months, rather than issu-
ing common or preferred stock?
2.	 What do you think of Smucker’s deal to spread  
$50 million in payments to Sara Lee over 10 years 
after paying $350 up front for the liquid coffee con-
centrate business? Explain your answer.

Understand why financial management is important in 
today’s uncertain economy.
The last few years have been especially difficult for financial 
managers. Financial managers have had to deal with a 
downturn in sales and profits. In some cases, banks stopped 
making loans even to companies that had always been able to 
borrow money. And the number of companies selling stock for 
the first time to the general public decreased. The worst-case 
scenario: There was an increase in the number of businesses 
that filed for bankruptcy during the crisis. Fortunately, there 
were many more business firms that were able to weather the 
economic storm and keep operating because of their ability 
to manage their finances.
Financial management consists of all activities concerned 
with obtaining money and using it effectively. Financial man-
agement can be viewed as a two-sided problem. On one side, 
the uses of funds often dictate the type or types of financing 
needed by a business. On the other side, the activities a busi-
ness can undertake are determined by the types of financ-
ing available. Financial managers must ensure that funds are 
available when needed, that they are obtained at the lowest 
possible cost, and that they are used as efficiently as possible. 
In the wake of the economic crisis, the Dodd–Frank Wall 
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into 
law. And today, there is an ongoing debate if more regula-
tions are needed. Still, there are a number of rewarding jobs 
in finance for qualified job applicants. 
Identify a firm’s short- and long-term 
financial needs.
Short-term financing is money that will be used for one year 
or less. There are many short-term needs, but cash flow, 
speculative production, and inventory are three for which 
financing is often required. Long-term financing is money 
that will be used for more than one year. Such financing 
may be required for a business start-up, for a merger or 
an acquisition, for new product development, for long-
term marketing activities, for replacement of equipment, or 
for expansion of facilities. According to financial experts, 
business firms will find it more difficult to raise both short- 
and long-term financing in the future because of increased 
regulations and more cautious lenders. Financial managers 
must also consider the risk–return ratio when making 
financial decisions. The risk–return ratio is based on the 
principle that a high-risk decision should generate higher 
financial returns for a business. On the other hand, more 
conservative decisions generate lesser returns.

Summarize the process of planning for financial 
management.
A financial plan begins with an organization’s goals 
and objectives. Next, a firm’s goals and objectives are 
“translated” into departmental budgets that detail expected 
income and expenses. From these budgets, which may be 
combined into an overall cash budget, the financial manager 
determines what funding will be needed and where it may be 
obtained. Whereas departmental and cash budgets emphasize 
short-term financing needs, a capital budget can be used to 
estimate a firm’s expenditures for major assets and its long-
term financing needs. The four principal sources of financing 
are sales revenues, equity capital, debt capital, and proceeds 
from the sale of assets. Once the needed funds have been 
obtained, the financial manager is responsible for monitoring 
and evaluating the firm’s financial activities.
Describe the advantages and disadvantages of 
different methods of short-term debt financing.
Most short-term financing is unsecured; that is, no collateral 
is required. Sources of unsecured short-term financing include 
trade credit, promissory notes issued to suppliers, unsecured 
bank loans, and commercial paper. Sources of secured short-
term financing include loans secured by inventory and 
accounts receivable. A firm may also sell its receivables to 
factors. Trade credit is the least-expensive source of short-
term financing. The cost of financing through other sources 
generally depends on the source and on the credit rating of 
the firm that requires the financing. Factoring is generally the 
most expensive approach.
Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of 
equity financing.
A corporation can raise equity capital by selling either 
common or preferred stock. The first time a corporation sells 
stock to the general public is referred to as an initial public 
offering (IPO). With an IPO, the stock is sold in the primary 
market. Once sold in the primary market, investors buy and 
sell stock in the secondary market. Usually, secondary market 
transactions are completed through a securities exchange or 
the over-the-counter market. Common stock is voting stock; 
holders of common stock elect the corporation’s directors 
and often must approve changes to the corporate charter. 
Holders of preferred stock must be paid dividends before 
holders of common stock are paid any dividends. Another 
source of equity funding is retained earnings, which is the 
portion of a business’s profits not distributed to stockholders. 
Venture capital—money invested in small (and sometimes 
struggling) firms that have the potential to become very 
successful—is yet another source of equity funding. Finally, 
a private placement can be used to sell stocks and other 
corporate securities.

Part 7   Finance and Investment
Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of 
long-term debt financing.
For a small business, debt financing is generally limited to 
loans. Large corporations have the additional option of 
issuing corporate bonds. Regardless of whether the business 
is small or large, it can take advantage of financial leverage. 
Financial leverage is the use of borrowed funds to increase the 
return on owners’ equity. The rate of interest for long-term 
loans usually depends on the financial status of the borrower, 
the reason for borrowing, and the kind of collateral pledged 
to back up the loan. Long-term business loans are normally 
repaid in 3 to 7 years but can be as long as 15 to 20 years. 
6
Money realized from the sale of corporate bonds must be 
repaid when the bonds mature. In addition, the corporation 
must pay interest on that money from the time the bonds are 
sold until maturity. The interest rate the corporation must 
pay often depends on the financial health of the firm issuing 
bonds. Maturity dates for bonds generally range from 10 
to 30 years after the date of issue. Three types of bonds—
debentures, mortgage bonds, and convertible bonds—are sold 
to raise debt capital. When comparing the cost of equity and 
debt long-term financing, the ongoing costs of using stock 
(equity) to finance a business are low. The most expensive is 
a long-term loan (debt).

Discussion Questions
Nederlander Concerts is in the business of booking, promoting, 
and producing live music shows in the western United States. The 
company presents artists ranging from James Taylor to Flogging 
Molly, Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie Raitt, and the Allman Brothers 
Band. But, says CEO Adam Friedman, “We’re not trying to be 
necessarily a national player or an international player. We seek 
out opportunities that fit within and leverage our existing portfo-
lio of small- to mid-size venues. . . . It’s one of the few remaining 
family-run entertainment enterprises worldwide. . . . What this 
means for us on a day-to-day basis is that we can focus on run-
ning the business. We’re not as guided by Wall Street, we don’t 
have the same constraints, we don’t have the same reporting 
responsibilities, and it allows us to focus on . . . our business 
strategy for development.”
Of course, being a privately owned company and not need-
ing to respond to shareholders (Wall Street) doesn’t mean 
that Nederlander has no reporting responsibilities. As the CEO 
explains, “We assess at the beginning of the year not only con-
cert revenue and expenses but also special event revenue.” 
Nederlander owns some theaters, amphitheaters, and arenas, and 
it sometimes rents space for concerts and events along the West 
Coast. “When we rent the facilities to, for example, movie pre-
mieres here in Los Angeles, what kind of revenue are we going to 
see? What kind of expenses are attended to generating that rev-
enue? What’s our fixed overhead for the year? Who’s on the pay-
roll, whether full-time, or part-time, or seasonal, and how much 
does it cost us to run the business on a day-to-day basis in order 
to secure those revenues and pay those expenses? That’s wrapped 
up into an annual budget at the beginning of every year, which is 
kind of a guideline for me to know how we achieve growth. It also 
allows me to communicate to our owners what our growth orien-
tation is for that given year. . . . Every event has its own profit and 
loss statement . . . which is a mini version of that annual plan,” 
says the CEO.
In addition to daily, weekly, and quarterly event reports, 
Nederlander’s financial team generates daily and weekly reports 
of ticket sales. Monthly reports on company-wide performance 
feed into quarterly and annual reports. Each annual report is 
compared to that year’s budget. The finance department tal-
lies hundreds of transactions in order to arrive at some of these 
annual numbers, which are reported to the company’s owners to 
ensure that the company is running as profitably as it can be.
Nederlander’s managers say growth in the concert industry 
must be measured in the long term because the business is cycli-
cal and the cost of real estate is so high that short-term profit is 
hard to generate. Still, the company is in a strong financial posi-
tion (it is part of a profitable global theater-ownership company 
called the Nederlander Organization), so it can afford to fund its 
own growth and expansion, or it can borrow on favorable terms. 
“We’re very fortunate to have an ownership that is very well capi-
talized with over 80 years in the business,” says the CEO. “Our 
balance sheet is so strong that we have the ability to tap into debt 
financing if it makes the most sense. . . . or [use] the corporate 
treasury. . . . If it makes more sense to borrow the money, we will, 
and we’re typically able to do that on very favorable rates because 
of very long-term banking relationships.”
It can be thrilling to meet some of the artists the company 
books. “But at the end of the day, it’s a business,” the CEO 
points out. “If we’re not successful in growing our revenue and 
managing our expense, ultimately we won’t be profitable, and our 
ownership will not be happy with those results.”16
Questions
1.	 Here’s what Nederlander’s chief operating officer has to say 
about its business model: “A show has a short lifetime. You 
go and sell two months out, and the tickets have no value 
on any day but the day of the show. So it’s a very interesting 
model in that sense.” How do you think the short life of the 
company’s products affects its financial planning?
2.	 The company uses its own arenas and theaters about 90 per-
cent of the time. What are some of the possible advantages 
and disadvantages of owning its own venues?
3.	 Why would Nederlander choose to sometimes borrow funds 
for expansion if it has capital of its own?

Growth has been on the menu ever since Bill Darden opened his 
first Red Lobster restaurant in Florida in 1968. The combination 
of fresh seafood and casual dining caught on quickly—and quickly 
caught the eye of General Mills, which bought the fast-growing 
company in 1970. In 1995, General Mills renamed the company 
after its founder and spun it off in a public offering. Once it went 
public, Darden Restaurants used the proceeds to chart a new 
financial path to long-term growth.
Today, Darden employs 180,000 people and serves more 
than 400 million meals each year across North America in 
1,900 casual, full-service restaurants. The company’s seven 
restaurant brands are: Red Lobster (seafood), Olive Garden 
(Italian menu), LongHorn Steakhouse (Western-theme steaks 
and more), The Capital Grille (premium steak house), Bahama 
Breeze (Caribbean-theme casual dining), Seasons 52 (fresh-grilled 
foods), and Eddie V’s (prime seafood and steaks). In all, Darden’s 
yearly revenue tops $7.5 billion.
Healthy cash flow is definitely on the menu. The average 
Capital Grille unit rings up $6.5 million in annual sales, the 
average Olive Garden rings up $4.8 million in annual sales, 
the average Red Lobster rings up $3.6 million, and the average 
LongHorn Steakhouse rings up $2.9 million. With the cash gen-
erated from restaurant revenue, Darden has been reinvesting in 
its businesses by opening new units, remodeling existing units, 
and greening its restaurants with eco-friendly materials and 
energy-saving touches. Because of its size, it can take advan-
tage of economies of scale in buying foods and beverages from 
global sources, which in turn helps keep costs under control and 
supports good profit margins.
Over the years, the company has fueled its continued expan-
sion with a combination of debt and equity. The company can 
draw on a revolving credit agreement of almost $500 million, 
which helps smooth out the financial bumps of its seasonal 
business. Typically, Darden’s revenue spikes in the spring and 
descends to a low point in the fall, although sales are defi-
nitely affected by weather conditions, economic circumstances, 
holidays, and other uncontrollable elements. Having revolving 
credit in place provides the flexibility to borrow if and when 
needed.
Darden has also raised money by issuing corporate bonds, 
some of which mature in 5 years, some in 10 years, some in 
20 years, and some with even longer maturities. Twice a year, 
the company pays interest to its bondholders. On the equity 
side, Darden’s common stock trades on the New York Stock 
Exchange, and it pays cash dividends to its shareholders. Its 
cash flow has been so strong, in fact, that Darden increased its 
dividend not long ago and has focused on paying down debt 
even as it invests in business.
Looking ahead, Darden expects to continue its growth spurt, 
despite an unpredictable economy and intense competition 
from big names in fast food and casual dining. It avoided the 
heavy, broad-based discounting that some chains used to attract 
customers during the recent economic crisis. Instead, it used 
occasional, selective price promotions to heighten its message of 
affordability. The company’s financial stability means that it has 
money available for making acquisitions, building new restau-
rants, developing new menu items, training new staff members, 
and launching new advertising campaigns.
Within the past decade, Darden has used its financial 
strength to buy and expand the Capital Grill and LongHorn 
Steakhouse restaurant chains. And Darden acquired the Eddie 
V’s and Wildfish Seafood Grill restaurant chain in 2011. It 
is also responding to increased consumer interest in healthy 
dining by opening more of its Seasons 52 restaurants, which 
feature only steamed, baked, or grilled dishes. As its name 
implies, Seasons 52 adds new menu items regularly, depending 
on what’s in season. The ever-changing menu brings customers 
back again and again to try seasonal specialties and enjoy old 
favorites.
Sometimes Darden closes underperforming units or sells 
entire chains so that it can put its money and management atten-
tion into other growth opportunities. A few years ago, Darden 
divested its Smokey Bones Barbecue & Grill chain after determin-
ing that this restaurant concept did not have the potential for 
nationwide expansion and profit potential that Darden required. 
What will Darden do next in its quest for profitable, long-term 
growth?17
Questions
1.	 Darden is spending heavily to upgrade the interior of many of 
its Red Lobster and LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants. How 
would you suggest that the company measure the financial 
results of this remodeling program?
2.	 Why would Darden issue corporate bonds with maturities of 
5, 10, 20 years or even longer maturities?
3.	 If Darden needs cash to remodel existing restaurants and 
open new restaurants, as well as to pay down debt, why 
would it increase its cash dividend that is paid to its stock-
holders?

1 	SOCIAL MEDIA EXERCISE 
Turbo Tax is probably one of the best-known tax preparation 
services in the world. One of the reasons for its popularity is that 
it provides tax software that people really need. Another reason 
for its popularity is the company’s use of social media through 
various platforms that include building an online community of 
users, using Twitter, and developing a YouTube channel. Each 
video on the TurboTax channel illustrates how a company can 
use social media to provide valuable information to customers. 
You can check out Turbo Tax videos at www.youtube.com/user/
TurboTax/videos. 
1.	 Visit the YouTube channel for Turbo Tax (www.youtube.com/
user/TurboTax/videos). Do you think social media is an effec-
tive method of obtaining the tax information you might need 
to prepare your taxes?
2.	 Can you think of other companies that could use videos on 
a YouTube channel to share information that their customers 
could use?
2 	JOURNALING FOR SUCCESS
Because many people spend more than they make on a regular 
basis, they often use credit cards to make routine daily purchases. 
As a result, the amount they owe on credit cards increases each 
month and there is no money left to begin a savings or invest-
ment program. This exercise will help you to understand (1) how 
you manage your credit cards and (2) what steps you can take to 
improve your personal finances.
Assignment
1.	 How many credit cards do you have?
2.	 Based on the information on your monthly credit card state-
ments, what types of credit card purchases do you make?
3.	 Do you pay your balance in full each month or make mini-
mum payments on your credit cards?
4.	 Most experts recommend that you have one or two credit 
cards that you use only if you are in an emergency situ-
ation. The experts also recommend that you avoid using 
credit cards to make inexpensive purchases on a daily basis. 
Finally, the experts recommend that you pay your balance in 
full each month. 
5.	 Based on the preceding information, what steps can you 
take to better manage your personal finances?
3 	DEVELOPING CRITICAL-THINKING SKILLS
Financial management involves preparing a plan for obtaining 
and using the money needed to accomplish a firm’s goals and 
objectives. To accomplish your own goals and objectives, you 
should prepare a personal financial plan. You must determine 
what is important in your life and what you want to accomplish, 
budget the amount of money required to obtain your goals, and 
identify sources for acquiring the funds. You should monitor and 
evaluate the results regularly and make changes when necessary.
Assignment
1.	 Using the three steps shown in Figure 19.3, prepare a per-
sonal financial plan.
2.	 Prepare a three-column table to display your plan.
a.	 In column 1, list at least two goals or objectives under 
each of the following areas: Financial (savings, invest-
ments, retirement), Education (training, degrees, certifi-
cates), Career (position, industry, location), and Family 
(children, home, education, trips, entertainment).
b.	 In column 2, list the amount of money it will take to 
accomplish your goals or objectives.
c.	 In column 3, identify the sources of funds for each goal or 
objective.
3.	 Describe what you learned from doing this exercise in a com-
ments section at the bottom of the table.
4 	BUILDING TEAM SKILLS
Suppose that for the past three years you have been repairing 
lawn mowers in your garage. Your business has grown steadily, 
and you recently hired two part-time workers. Your garage is no 
longer adequate for your business; it is also in violation of the city 
code, and you have already been fined for noncompliance. You 
have decided that it is time to find another location for your shop 
and that it also would be a good time to expand your business. If 
the business continues to grow in the new location, you plan to 
hire a full-time employee to repair small appliances. You are con-
cerned, however, about how you will get the money to move your 
shop and get it established in a new location.
Assignment
1.	 With all class members participating, use brainstorming to 
identify the following:
a.	 The funds you will need to accomplish your business goals
b.	 The sources of short-term financing available to you
c.	 Problems that might prevent you from getting a short-
term loan
d.	 How you will repay the money if you get a loan
2.	 Have a classmate write the ideas on the board.
3.	 Discuss how you can overcome any problems that might ham-
per your current chances of getting a loan and how your busi-
ness can improve its chances of securing short-term loans in 
the future.
4.	 Summarize what you learned from participating in this  
exercise.

Part 7   Finance and Investment
The Vanguard Group Thinks Low-Cost and High-Tech
The Vanguard Group helps investors make the most of their money by offering low-cost 
investments and high-tech access. From its early days, the company focused not on indi-
vidual stocks or bonds but on selling shares in mutual funds, pools of money invested in 
a select group of stocks or bonds. Vanguard was a pioneer in establishing mutual funds 
tied to a specific group of common stocks or bonds in a particular financial index. Before 
Vanguard launched its Vanguard 500 Index Fund, individual investors had no way to buy 
this type of indexed mutual fund directly from an investment company. Today, Vanguard 
offers hundreds of mutual funds and many other securities for every type of investor and 
every investment goal, short- and long-term.
Because the Vanguard Group is owned by the different funds it manages, it has a long 
tradition of operating mutual funds “at cost.” As a result, investors pay lower mutual fund 
fees, and more of their money remains invested to earn returns year after year. Exactly how 
low is low? By Vanguard’s calculations, its average expense ratio is, on average, one-fifth 
of the industry average. To dramatize this difference, Vanguard recently sent an “At-Cost 
Café” food truck on tour selling coffee at 28 cents per cup—just one-fifth of the usual price. 
“The concept of at-cost investing can be difficult to explain,” says a Vanguard spokesper-
son, “so we are trying to help investors ‘experience’ it through something tangible, such as 
a routine daily purchase like coffee.” 
Vanguard also uses the latest technology to let customers check on their accounts and 
investigate new investment possibilities at any hour, from any place. In addition to its Web 
site, which offers detailed financial information, online trading, and much more, the com-
pany provides downloadable apps for cell phones and tablet computers. Whether investors 
are just starting out or have a lot of investing experience, they can use the technology of 
their choice to see their recent transactions, analyze investment performance, buy or sell 
securities, read Vanguard’s research reports, subscribe to its electronic newsletter, and 
watch its educational videos—all at the touch of a finger or the click of a mouse.1
Did You Know?
Based in Valley Forge, 
Pennsylvania, Vanguard employs 
13,000 people worldwide 
and manages investments 
worth $1.75 trillion.
Inside
Business
FYI
A
s the saying goes, “I’ve been rich and I’ve been poor, but believe me, rich is 
­better.” Yet, just dreaming of being rich does not make it happen. Although being 
rich does not guarantee happiness, managing your personal finances and begin-
ning an investment program are both worthy goals. Firms such as Vanguard Group—the 
company profiled in the Inside Business feature for this chapter—offer an array of ser-
vices to help people manage their personal finances, research investments, and buy and 
sell stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other securities. Nevertheless, you must be willing 
to invest the time and effort required to manage your personal finances and become a 
good investor. Furthermore, do not underestimate how important you are when it comes 
to managing your money. No one is going to make you manage your money. No one is 
going to make you save the money you need to fund an investment program. These are 
your decisions—important decisions that literally can change your life.
Many people ask the question: Why begin an investment program now? To answer 
that question, you must understand that personal finance experts agree that the best 
investment program is one that stresses long-term growth over a 20- to 40-year period. 
As you will see later in this chapter, the dollar value of your investments may decrease 
over a short time period, but historically the value of quality securities has usually 
increased over a long time period.

net worth  the difference between 
the value of your total assets and 
your total liabilities
personal budget  a specific plan 
for spending your income
A second compelling reason to start an investment program is that the sooner you 
start an investment program, the more time your investments have to work for you. 
So why do people wait to begin investing? In most cases, there are two reasons. First, 
they do not have the money needed to fund an investment program. However, once you 
begin managing your personal finances and get your spending under control, you will 
be able to save the money needed to fund an investment program. The second reason 
people do not begin investing is because they do not know anything about investing. 
Again, this chapter provides the basics to get you started.
We begin this chapter by examining everyday money management activities and 
outlining the reasons for developing a personal investment plan. Next we discuss 
important factors to consider when choosing investments and describe both traditional 
and high-risk (or speculative) investments. Then, we explain how to use information 
to evaluate potential investments. Finally, we examine the methods used to buy and 
sell investments.
It is time! Take the first step, and begin managing your personal finances.
Managing Your Personal Finances
Although it would be nice if you could accumulate wealth magically, it is not magic. 
Most people begin by making sure that their “financial house” is in order. In this 
section, we examine several steps for effective money management that will help you 
to prepare for an investment program.
Step 1: Tracking Your Income, 
Expenses, Assets, and Liabilities
Many personal finance experts recommend that you begin the process of managing 
your money by determining your current financial condition. Often the first step is 
to construct a personal income statement and balance sheet. (Note: Both personal 
income statements and balance sheets were examined in more detail in Chapter 17.) A 
personal income statement lists your income and your expenses for a specific period of 
time—usually a month. By subtracting expenses from income, you can determine if you 
have a surplus or a deficit at the end of the time period. Surplus funds can be used for 
savings, investing, or for any purpose that you feel is important. On the other hand, if 
you have a deficit, you must take actions to reduce spending and pay down any debts 
you may have that will keep you from starting an investment program.
To get another picture of your current financial condition, you should construct 
a personal balance sheet. A personal balance sheet lists your assets and liabilities on 
a specific date. By subtracting your total liabilities from your total assets, you can 
determine your net worth. For an individual, net worth is the difference between the 
value of your total assets and your total liabilities. Over time, the goal is to increase the 
value of your assets (items of value that you own) and decrease liabilities (your debts).
Based on the information contained in these two statements, you can determine 
your current financial condition and where you spend your money. You can also take 
the next step: Construct a personal budget.
Step 2: Developing a Budget that Works
A personal budget is a specific plan for spending your income. You begin by estimating 
your income for a specific period—for example, next month. For most people, their 
major source of income is their salary. The second step is to list expenses for the 
same time period. Typical expenses include savings and investments, housing, food, 
transportation, entertainment, and so on. For most people, this is the area where you 
can make choices and increase or decrease the amount spent on different items listed 
in your budget. For example, you may decide to reduce the dollar amount spent on 
entertainment to increase the amount for savings. Above all, it is important to balance 
Explain why you should 
manage your personal 
finances and develop a 
personal investment program.

Part 7   Finance and Investment
personal investment  the use of 
your personal funds to earn a 
financial return
your budget so that your income is equal to the money you spend, save, or invest each 
month. For help managing your money and constructing a realistic budget, you may 
want to visit the Mint.com Web site (www.mint.com), the Motley Fool Web site (www.
fool.com), or similar sites on the Internet. Both of these Web sites provide free help and 
advice that can help you take the necessary steps to improve your personal finances.
After you have constructed your personal budget, you will need to compare the 
amounts included in your budget with your actual income and expenses. The goal is 
that the estimated income and expenses are correct and that you have a surplus at the 
end of the budgeting period. If income is less than anticipated or expenses are more 
than budgeted, then you will need to take corrective actions to get your budget back 
on track. Often one change will affect other areas of your budget as well. An increase 
in your monthly rent payment, for instance, may mean that you have to reduce the 
amount spent on entertainment to balance your budget. Caution: Avoid the temptation 
to spend more than you make by using credit cards or borrowing money.
Step 3: Managing Credit Card Debt
Unfortunately, many individuals spend more than they make. They purchase items 
on credit and then make monthly payments and pay finance charges ranging from 
10 to 21 percent or more. It makes no sense to start an investment program until 
payments for credit card and installment purchases, along with the accompanying 
finance charges, are reduced or eliminated.
Although all cardholders have reasons for using their credit cards, the important 
point to remember is that it is very easy to get in trouble by using your credit cards. 
Watch for the following five warning signs.
	 1.	Don’t fall behind on payments. One of the first warning signs is the inability to pay 
your entire balance each month. 
	 2.	Do not use your credit cards to pay for many small purchases during the month. 
This can often lead to a “real surprise” when you open your credit card statement 
at the end of the month.
	 3.	Do not use the cash advance provision that accompanies most credit cards. The 
reason is simple: The interest rate is usually higher for cash advances.
	 4.	Think about the number of cards you really need. Most experts recommend that 
an individual have one or two cards and use these cards for emergencies.
	 5.	Get help if you think you are in trouble. Organizations like Consumer Credit 
Counseling Service (www.cccs.net) or the National Foundation for Credit Counseling 
(www.nfcc.org) can often help you work out a plan to pay off credit card debt.
By reducing or eliminating credit purchases, eventually the amount of cash remain-
ing after the bills are paid will increase and can be used to start a savings and invest-
ment program that will help you obtain your investment goals.
Investment Goals
Personal investment is the use of your personal funds to earn a financial return. Thus, 
in the most general sense, the goal of investing is to earn money with money. However, 
such a goal is completely useless for the individual because it is so vague and so easily 
attained.
In reality, an investment goal must be specific and measurable. It must be tailored 
to you so that it takes into account your particular financial needs. It must also be 
oriented toward the future because investing is usually a long-term undertaking. By 
investing small amounts of money each year over a 20- to 40-year period, you can 
accumulate money for emergencies and retirement. In addition, if you choose quality 
investments, the value of your investments will grow over a long period of time. Finally, 
an investment goal must be realistic in terms of current economic conditions and avail-
able investment opportunities.
Some financial planners suggest that investment goals should be stated in terms of 
money: “By January 1, 2022, I will have total assets of $80,000.” Others believe that

money so that I can take a year off from work to travel 
around the world.” Like the goals themselves, the way 
they are stated depends on you. The following questions 
can be helpful in establishing valid investment goals:
	 1.	What financial goals do you want to achieve?
	 2.	How much money will you need, and when?
	 3.	What will you use the money for?
	 4.	Is it reasonable to assume that you can obtain the amount 
of money you will need to meet your investment goals?
	 5.	Do you expect your personal situation to change in a way 
that will affect your investment goals?
	 6.	What economic conditions could alter your investment 
goals?
	 7.	Are you willing to make the necessary sacrifices to ensure 
that your investment goals are met?
Keep in mind the investment goals you develop may be 
affected by your career choice. If you choose a career that pro-
vides above-average financial rewards, you can develop more 
challenging investment goals. If you choose a career that pro-
vides average or below-average financial rewards, it is still pos-
sible to develop an investment program by carefully managing 
your personal finances. Simply put: You must control spending 
and manage debt regardless of how much money you make.
A Personal Investment Program
Once you have formulated specific goals and have some money to invest, investment 
planning is similar to planning for a business. It begins with the evaluation of different 
investment opportunities—including the potential return and risk involved in each. At 
the very least, this process requires some careful study and maybe some expert advice. 
Investors should beware of people who call themselves “financial planners” but who 
are in reality nothing more than salespersons for various financial 
investments, tax shelters, or insurance plans.
A true financial planner has had at least two years of train-
ing in investments, insurance, taxation, retirement planning, and 
estate planning and has passed a rigorous examination. As evidence 
of training and successful completion of the qualifying examina-
tion, the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) Board of Standards  
(www.cfp.net) in Washington, D.C., allows individuals to use  
the designation CFP. Similarly, the American College (www 
.theamericancollege.edu) in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, allows indi-
viduals who have completed the necessary requirements to use the 
designation Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC). Most CFPs 
and ChFCs do not sell a particular investment product or receive 
commissions for their investment recommendations. Instead, they 
charge consulting fees that range from $100 to $250 an hour.
Many financial planners suggest that you accumulate an “emer-
gency fund”—a certain amount of money that can be obtained 
quickly in case of immediate need—before beginning an investment 
program. The amount of money that should be salted away in a 
savings account varies from person to person. Most financial plan-
ners agree that an amount equal to at least three months’ living 
expenses is reasonable. However, you may want to increase your 
emergency fund in anticipation of a crisis.

What are your personal, professional, and investment 
goals? Just like a successful business, you should be looking 
ahead to what you want to achieve in the next few years 
and writing down specific goals for yourself. If one goal is 
to start an investment program, for example, it will help to 
think about how much you’ll need to start investing and 
how much you will want to accumulate by a specific date.

Managing your personal finances can improve 
a relationship! Often money problems can cause 
relationships to sour and can even lead to divorce 
for some couples. On the other hand, managing your 
personal finances can lead to financial stability, peace 
of mind, and a more stable personal relationship.

Dow Jones Industrial Average 
an average of 30 leading U.S. 
corporations that reflect the U.S. 
stock market as a whole
After the emergency account is established, you may invest additional funds 
according to your investment program. Some additional funds may already be avail-
able, or money for further investing may be saved out of earnings. For suggestions to 
help you obtain the money needed to fund your investment program, see Table 20.1.
Monitoring the Value of Your Investment Program
In fall 2007, the stock market, as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, reached 
an all-time high at 14,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is an average of 30 leading 
U.S. corporations that reflect the U.S. stock market as a whole. By March 2009, the same 
average had declined to 6,600. What happened? The simple answer is that the United 
States (and most of the world) experienced an economic meltdown. This economic crisis 
had many causes, including a banking and financial crisis, a downturn in home sales, 
lower consumer spending, and high unemployment rates. Although the economy shows 
signs of improving at the time of publication, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 
just over 13,000 at the time of publication, a crisis could happen again.
Although monitoring your investment program and re-evaluating your investment 
choices are always important, the recent economic crisis underscores the importance 
of managing your personal finances and your investment program. Because of the 
nation’s economic problems, many people were caught off guard. Moreover, some 
individuals were forced to sell some or all of their investments at depressed prices just 
to pay for everyday necessities.
To avoid the type of problems just described, you must monitor your investment 
program and, if necessary, modify it. Always keep in mind your circumstances and 
economic conditions are both subject to change. 
Important Factors in 
Personal Investment
How can you (or a financial planner) tell which investments are “right” for your investment 
program and which are not? One way to start is to match potential investments with 
your investment goals in terms of safety, risk, income, growth, and liquidity.
Safety and Risk
Safety and risk are two sides of the same coin. Safety in an investment means 
minimal risk of loss; risk in an investment means a measure of uncertainty about 
the outcome. If you want a steady increase in value over an extended period of time, 
choose safe investments, such as certificates of deposit (CDs), highly rated government 
and corporate bonds, and the stocks of highly regarded corporations—sometimes

Describe how the factors of 
safety, risk, income, growth, 
and liquidity affect your 
investment program.
Table 20.1	
Suggestions to Help You Accumulate the Money Needed to Fund an Investment Program
1.  Pay yourself first. Many financial experts recommend that you (1) pay your monthly bills, (2) save a reasonable amount of 
money, and (3) use whatever money is left over for personal expenses.
2.  Take advantage of employer-sponsored retirement programs. Many employers will match part or all of the contributions you make 
to a 401(k) or 403(b) retirement account.
3.  Participate in an elective savings program. Elect to have money withheld from your paycheck each payday and automatically 
deposited in a savings or investment account.
4.  Make a special savings effort one or two months each year. By cutting back to the basics, you can obtain money for investment 
purposes.
5.  Take advantage of gifts, inheritances, and windfalls. During your lifetime, you likely will receive gifts, inheritances, salary increases, 
year-end bonuses, or federal income tax returns. Instead of spending these windfalls, invest these funds.

blue-chip stock  a safe investment 
that generally attracts conservative 
investors
rate of return  the total dollar 
amount of return you receive 
on an investment over a specific 
period of time divided by the 
amount invested
called blue-chip stocks. A blue-chip stock is a safe investment 
that generally attracts conservative investors. Blue-chip stocks are 
generally issued by corporations that are industry leaders and have 
provided their stockholders with stable earnings and dividends over 
a number of years. Selected mutual funds and real estate may also 
be very safe investments.
If you want higher dollar returns on investments, you must 
generally give up some safety. In general, the potential return should 
be directly related to the assumed risk. That is, the greater the risk 
you assume, the higher the potential monetary reward. As you will 
see shortly, there are a number of speculative—and potentially 
profitable—investments.
Often beginning investors are afraid of the risk associated with 
many investments. However, it helps to remember that without risk, it 
is impossible to obtain larger returns that really make your investment 
program grow. In fact, some investors often base their investment 
decision on projections for rate of return. You can also use the same 
calculation to determine how much you actually earn on an invest-
ment over a specific period of time. To calculate rate of return, the 
total dollar amount of return you receive on an investment over a 
­specific period of time is divided by the amount invested. For exam-
ple, assume that you invest $5,000 in Home Depot stock, you receive 
$108 in dividends, and the stock is worth $5,300 at the end of one 
year. Your rate of return is 8.2 percent, as illustrated here.
Step 1: Subtract the investment’s initial value from the investment’s value at the end of 
the year.
$5,300 2 $5,000 5 $300
Step 2: Add the dividend amount to the amount calculated in step 1.
$108 1 $300 5 $408
Step 3: Divide the total dollar amount of return calculated in step 2 by the original 
investment.
$408 4 $5,000 5 0.082 5 8.2 percent
Note: If an investment decreases in value, the steps used to calculate the rate of return 
are the same, but the answer is a negative number. With this information, it is possible 
to compare the rate of return for different investment alternatives that offer more or 
less risk.
Investment Income
Investors sometimes purchase certain investments because they want a predictable 
source of income. For example, CDs, corporate and government bonds, and certain 
stocks pay interest or dividends each year. Some mutual funds and real estate may also 
offer steady income potential. Such investments are generally used by conservative 
investors or retired individuals who need a predictable source of income.
When purchasing investments for income, most investors are concerned about the 
issuer’s ability to continue making periodic interest or dividend payments. Investors 
in CDs and bonds know exactly how much income they will receive each year. The 
dividends paid to stockholders can and do vary, even for the largest and most stable 
corporations. As with dividends from stock, the income from mutual funds and real 
estate may also vary from one year to the next.
Investment Growth
To investors, growth means that their investments will increase in value. For 
example, growing corporations such as Monster Beverage, Adobe Systems, Questcor 
Pharmaceuticals, and Silicon Motion Technology usually pay a small cash dividend or 
no dividend at all. Instead, profits are reinvested in the business (as retained earnings)

Purchasing stocks is one way to invest. Since 
1926, stocks have returned just below 10 percent 
a year—a larger return than most other investment 
alternatives. So why not just pick a bunch of stocks 
and begin investing? The truth is that an investment 
program should begin with a financial checkup 
to make sure that you are ready to invest and the 
creation of investment goals before you purchase any 
investment.

liquidity  the ease with which an 
investment can be converted into 
cash
to finance additional expansion. In this case, the value of the stock increases as the 
corporation expands.
Other investments that may offer growth potential include selected mutual funds 
and real estate. For example, many mutual funds are referred to as growth funds or 
aggressive growth funds because of the growth potential of the individual securities 
included in the fund.
Investment Liquidity
Liquidity is the ease with which an investment can be converted into cash. Investments 
range from cash or cash equivalents (such as investments in government securities or 
money-market accounts) to the other extreme of frozen investments, which you cannot 
convert easily into cash.
Although you may be able to sell stock, mutual-fund, and corporate-bond invest-
ments quickly, you may not regain the amount of money you originally invested 
because of market conditions, economic conditions, or many other reasons. It may also 
be difficult to find buyers for real estate. Furthermore, finding a buyer for investments 
in certain types of collectibles may also be difficult.
Factors That Can Improve 
Your Investment Decisions
We begin this section with an overview of how portfolio management can reduce 
investment risk and factors that you should consider to choose “just the right” 
investments. Then in the next two sections, we describe how the investments listed in

Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock 
Index  an index that contains 
500 different stocks that reflect 
increases or decreases in value for 
the U.S. stock market as a whole
asset allocation  the process 
of spreading your money 
among several different types of 
investments to lessen risk
Portfolio Management
“How can I choose the right investment?” That’s a good question! Unfortunately, 
there are no easy answers because your investment goals, age, tolerance for risk, and 
financial resources are different from those of the next person. To help you to decide 
what investment is right for you, consider the following: Since 1926, as measured by 
the Standard and Poor’s 500 Stock Index, stocks have returned on average just below 
10 percent a year. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index is an index that contains 
500 different stocks that reflect increases or decreases in value for the U.S. stock 
market as a whole. During the same period, U.S. government bonds have returned 
about 6 percent.2 Therefore, why not just invest all your money in stocks or mutual 
funds that invest in stocks? After all, they offer the largest potential return. In reality, 
stocks may have a place in every investment portfolio, but there is more to investing 
than just picking a bunch of stocks or stock mutual funds.
Asset Allocation, the Time Factor, and Your Age
Asset allocation is the process of spreading your money among several different 
types of investments to lessen risk. Although the term asset allocation is a fancy way 
of saying it, simply put, it really means that you need to diversify and avoid the pitfall 
of putting all of your eggs in one basket—a common mistake made by investors. Asset 
allocation is often expressed in percentages. For example, what percentage of my assets 
do I want to put in stocks and mutual funds? What percentage do I want to put in more 
conservative investments such as CDs and government bonds? In reality, the answers 
to these questions are determined by:
●
●The time your investments have to work for you
●
●Your age
●
●Your investment objectives
●
●Your ability to tolerate risk
●
●How much you can save and invest each year
●
●The dollar value of your current investments
●
●The economic outlook for the economy
●
●Several other factors
Two factors—the time your investments have to work for you and your age—are so 
important they deserve special attention.
The Time Factor  The amount of time you have before you need your investment 
money is crucial. If you can leave your investments alone and let them work for five 
to ten years or more, then you can invest in stocks, mutual funds, and real estate. On 
the other hand, if you need your investment money in two years, you probably should 
invest in short-term government bonds, highly rated corporate bonds, or CDs. By tak-
ing a more conservative approach for short-term investments, you reduce the possibil-
ity of having to sell your investments at a loss because of depressed market value or 
a staggering economy. For example, during the recent economic crisis, many retirees 
who were forced to sell stocks and mutual funds to pay for everyday living expenses 
lost money. On the other hand, many young investors with long-term investment goals 
could afford to hold their investments until the price of their securities recovered.
Your Age  You also should consider your age when developing an investment program. 
Younger investors tend to invest a large percentage of their nest egg in growth-oriented 
investments. On the other hand, older investors tend to choose more conservative 
investments. As a result, a smaller percentage of their nest egg is placed in growth-
oriented investments. While no investor regardless of age likes to lose money on an 
investment, the fact is that younger investors have more time for an investment to 
recover its original value and even increase in value. 
How much of your portfolio should be in growth-oriented investments? Well-
known personal financial expert Suze Orman suggests that you subtract your age

from 110, and the difference is the percentage of your assets that should be invested 
in growth investments. For example, if you are 30 years old, subtract 30 from 110, 
which gives you 80. Therefore, 80 percent of your assets should be invested in growth-
oriented investments, whereas the remaining 20 percent should be kept in safer con-
servative investments.3
Your Role in the Investment Process
Investors want large returns, yet they are often unwilling to invest the time required to 
become a good investor. They would not buy a car without a test drive or purchase a 
home without comparing different homes, but for some unknown reason they invest 
without doing their homework. The suggestions given here will help you choose 
investments that will increase in value.
●
●Evaluate potential investments. Keep in mind that successful investors evaluate 
their investments before making investment decisions. Often, it is useful to keep 
copies of the material you used to evaluate each investment. Then, when it is time 
to re-evaluate an existing investment, you will know where to begin your search 
for current information. Much of the information in this chapter in the section 
“Sources of Financial Information” will help you learn how to evaluate different 
investment opportunities.
●
●Monitor the value of your investments. Would you believe that some people invest 
large sums of money and do not know what their investments are worth? They 
do not know if their investments have increased or decreased in value and if they 
should sell their investments or continue to hold them. A much better approach is 
to monitor the value of your investments.
●
●Keep accurate and current records. Accurate record keeping can help you spot 
opportunities to maximize profits, reduce dollar losses when you sell your invest-
ments, and help you decide whether you want to invest additional funds in a 
specific investment. For tax purposes, you should keep purchase records for each 
of your investments that include the actual dollar cost of the investment, plus any 
commissions or fees you paid, along with records of dividends, interest income, or 
rental income you received.
Conservative Investment Alternatives
Typically investors who are afraid of the risk associated with stocks, mutual funds, and 
other investment alternatives, beginning investors, investors that need a predictable 
source of income, or people worried about a downturn in the economy will often invest 
their money in bank accounts, government bonds, or corporate bonds. 
Bank Accounts
Bank accounts that pay interest—and therefore are investments—include passbook 
savings accounts, money-market accounts, CDs, and other interest-bearing accounts. 
These investments were discussed in Chapter 18. The interest paid on bank accounts 
can be withdrawn to serve as income, or it can be left on deposit and increase the value 
of the bank account and provide for growth. At the time of this publication, one-year 
CDs were paying between 0.50 and 1 percent. Although CDs and other bank accounts 
are risk-free for all practical purposes, many investors often choose other investments 
because of the potential for larger returns.
Corporate and Government Bonds
In Chapter 19, we discussed why corporations issue bonds to obtain financing. The 
U.S. government and state and local governments also issue bonds for the same 
reason. Investors generally choose bonds because they provide a predictable source 
of income.

municipal bond  sometimes called 
a muni, a debt security issued by a 
state or local government
Government Bonds  Despite concerns about the increasing dollar amount of 
national debt for the United States, most investors still consider the nation’s govern-
ment bonds to be risk-free. The other side of the coin is that these bonds pay lower 
interest than most other investments. Interest paid on U.S. government securities is 
taxable for federal income tax purposes, but is exempt from state and local taxation.
Generally, investors choose from the five different types of U.S. government bonds and 
securities described in Table 20.3. With the exception of savings bonds, the minimum 
purchase for each type of U.S. government security is $100 with additional increments 
of $100 above the minimum. For more information about U.S. government securities, 
go to www.treasurydirect.gov.
Like the federal government, state and local governments sell bonds to obtain financ-
ing. A municipal bond, sometimes called a muni, is a debt security 
issued by a state or local government. Municipal bonds are espe-
cially attractive to wealthy investors because interest income from 
municipal bonds may be tax exempt from federal taxes. Whether or 
not the interest on municipal bonds is tax-exempt often depends on 
how the funds obtained from their sale are used. Caution: It is your 
responsibility, as an investor, to determine whether or not the inter-
est paid by municipal bonds is taxable. It is also your responsibility 
to evaluate municipal bonds. Although most municipal bonds are 
relatively safe, defaults have occurred in recent years.
Corporate Bonds  Because they are a form of long-term debt 
financing that must be repaid, investment-grade corporate bonds 
are generally considered a more conservative investment than either 
stocks or mutual funds that invest in stocks. One of the principal 
advantages of corporate bonds is that they are primarily long-term, 
income-producing investments. Between the time of purchase and 
the maturity date, the bondholder will receive interest payments—
usually semiannually, or every six months. For example, assume 
that you purchase a $1,000 bond—the usual face value for a cor-
porate bond—issued by the rail-based transportation giant CSX 
Invest in Green Bonds?
Should investors choose green bonds? The 
World Bank issues green bonds to pay 
for sustainability projects such as water 
purification, solar installations, and reforestation. 
Since 2008, it has issued $3.3 billion worth of green bonds, in 
17 currencies, with a range of maturities from 2 to 10 years. 
For example, Bank of America Merrill Lynch offers World Bank 
green bonds with 10-year maturities starting with a $1,000 
investment. Because repayment is not tied to the performance 
of the projects they finance, these bonds are rated as low-risk 
and carry relatively low interest rates. 
Nobody questions the need to fund sustainability projects. 
In fact, some institutional investors see green bonds as a 
way to support environmental action while diversifying their 
portfolios. One issue, however, is that the money goes into a 
World Bank account designated for environmental projects—
and investors don’t know which project they’re supporting. 
As a result, money from an investor who hopes to preserve 
the rainforest may actually be used for mass transportation 
improvements that reduce pollution. Another issue is liquidity. 
Demand for green bonds is unproven, and they aren’t traded 
as widely or as often as, say, U.S. Treasury bonds. In fact, 
lack of liquidity may be a real problem for investors who have 
to sell prior to maturity. So should investors choose green 
bonds?

Can U.S. savings bonds provide an umbrella for 
a rainy day? Despite concerns about the increasing 
dollar amount of the national debt for the United 
States, most investors still consider the nation’s savings 
bonds and securities issued by the U.S. Treasury to be 
risk-free because they are backed by the full faith and 
credit of the U.S. government. But be warned: When 
you invest in these conservative investments, you must 
accept smaller returns on your investments.

Corporation and that the interest rate for this bond is 6 percent. In this situation, 
you receive interest of $60 ($1,000 3 0.06 5 $60) a year from the corporation. For 
corporate bonds, interest is usually paid semiannually or every six months. In the case 
of the CSX bond just described, a bondholder will receive two $30 interest payments 
each year.
Most beginning investors think that a $1,000 bond is always worth $1,000. In 
reality, the price of a bond may fluctuate until its maturity date. Changes in the overall 
interest rates in the economy are the primary cause of most bond price fluctuations. 
When overall interest rates in the economy increase, the market value of existing bonds 
with a fixed interest rate typically declines. For example, the value of the CSX bond 
with a fixed 6 percent interest rate will decline if interest rates in the economy or 
interest rates for comparable bonds increase. When a bond’s price declines, it may be 
purchased for less than its face value. By holding the bond until maturity, bond owners 
can redeem the bond for more than they paid for it.
A corporate bond with a fixed interest rate can also increase in value if overall 
interest rates in the economy decline. In this situation, a bond like the CSX bond 
with a 6 percent fixed interest rate will increase in value. The difference between 
the purchase price and the selling price is profit and is in addition to annual interest 
income.
Before you invest in bonds, remember that the price of a corporate bond can 
decrease and that interest payments and eventual repayment may be a problem for a 
corporation that encounters financial difficulty. To compare potential risk and return 
on corporate bond issues, many investors rely on the bond ratings provided by Moody’s 
Investors Service, Inc., Fitch Ratings, and Standard & Poor’s Corporation.

stock dividend  a dividend in the 
form of additional stock
capital gain  the difference 
between a security’s purchase

market value  the price of one

Convertible Corporate Bonds  Some corporations prefer to issue convertible 
bonds because they carry a lower interest rate than nonconvertible bonds—by about 1 
to 2 percent. In return for accepting a lower interest rate, owners of convertible bonds 
have the opportunity for increased investment growth. For example, assume that you 
purchase an Advanced Micro Devices $1,000 corporate bond that is convertible to 
35.6125 shares of the company’s common stock. This means that you could con-
vert the bond to common stock whenever the price of the company’s stock is $28.08 
($1,000 4 35.6125 5 $28.08) or higher.4 However, owners may opt not to convert 
their bonds to common stock even if the market value of the common stock does 
increase to $28.08 or more. The reason for not exercising the conversion feature is 
quite simple. As the market value of the common stock increases, the price of the con-
vertible bond also increases. By not converting to common stock, bondholders enjoy 
interest income from the bond in addition to the increased bond value caused by the 
price movement of the common stock.
More Speculative Investments
Earlier in this chapter, we discussed the concepts of safety and risk. Before you examine 
more speculative investment alternatives, it may help to review the basic rule: The 
potential return should be directly related to the assumed risk. While all investors 
want larger returns, you must consider the risk involved with each of the following 
investments. Above all, keep in mind that dollar returns for the more speculative 
investments described in this section are not guaranteed. 
Common Stock
As mentioned in Chapter 19, corporations issue common stock to finance their business 
start-up costs and help pay for expansion and their ongoing business activities. Before 
investing in stock, keep in mind that corporations do not have to repay the money a 
stockholder pays for stock. Usually, a stockholder may sell her or his stock to another 
individual.
How do you make money by buying common stock? Basically, there are three 
ways: through dividend payments, through an increase in the value of the stock, or 
through stock splits.
Dividend Payments  One of the reasons why many stockhold-
ers invest in common stock is dividend income. Generally, divi-
dends are paid on a quarterly basis. At the time of publication, 
Kraft Foods paid its stockholders an annual dividend of $1.16 per 
share in quarterly payments of $0.29 every three months. Although 
corporations are under no legal obligation to pay dividends or can 
reduce dividends if the company experiences financial difficulties, 
most corporate board members like to keep stockholders happy 
(and prosperous). A corporation may pay stock dividends in place 
of—or in addition to—cash dividends. A stock dividend is a divi-
dend in the form of additional stock. It is paid to shareholders just 
as cash dividends are paid—in proportion to the number of shares 
owned.
Increase in Dollar Value  Another way to make money on stock 
investments is through a capital gain that occurs when you sell 
stock. A capital gain is the difference between a security’s purchase 
price and its selling price. To earn a capital gain, you must sell when 
the market value of the stock is higher than the original purchase 
price you paid for the stock. The market value is the price of one 
share of a stock at a particular time. Let’s assume that on March 8,

Should you invest in Cheerios? While most everyone 
in the United States recognizes the Cheerios brand, 
did you know that the famous cereal is manufactured 
and marketed by General Mills? Often you have to 
dig deeper if you want to invest in a corporation that 
produces a famous product or service to determine if 
the “parent” company is a quality investment that will 
help you obtain your financial goals.

Part 7   Finance and Investment
stock split  the division of 
each outstanding share of a 
corporation’s stock into a greater 
number of shares
2009, you purchased 100 shares of Kellogg common stock at a cost of $37 a share and 
that you paid $25 in commission charges, for a total investment of $3,725. Let’s also 
assume that you held your 100 shares until March 8, 2012, and then sold the Kellogg 
stock for $52. Your total return on investment is shown in Table 20.4. You realized 
a profit of $1,925 because you received dividends totaling $4.75 a share during the 
three-year period and because the stock’s market value increased by $15 a share. Of 
course, if the stock’s market value had decreased, or if the firm’s board of directors 
had voted to reduce or omit dividends, your return would have been less than the total 
dollar return illustrated in Table 20.4.
Stock Splits  Directors of many corporations feel that there is an optimal price range 
within which their firm’s stock is most attractive to investors. When the market value 
increases beyond that range, they may declare a stock split to bring the price down. 
A stock split is the division of each outstanding share of a corporation’s stock into a 
greater number of shares.
The most common stock splits result in one, two, or three new shares for each orig-
inal share. For example, in November 2011, the board of directors of Estée Lauder, the 
company known for skin care, cosmetics, fragrances, and hair-care products, approved 
a two-for-one stock split. After this split, a stockholder who originally owned 100 
shares owned 200 shares. The value of an original share was proportionally reduced. 
In the case of Estée Lauder, the market value per share was reduced to half the stock’s 
value before the two-for-one stock split. There is no evidence to support that a corpora-
tion’s long-term performance is improved by a stock split; however, some investors do 
profit from stock splits on a short-term basis. Be warned: There are no guarantees that 
the stock will increase in value after a split. However, the stock may be more attractive 
to the investing public because of the potential for a rapid increase in dollar value. This 
attraction is based on the belief that most corporations split their stock only when their 
financial future is improving and on the upswing.
Preferred Stock
As we noted in Chapter 19, a firm’s preferred stockholders must receive their dividends 
before common stockholders are paid any dividends. Moreover, the preferred-stock 
dividend amount is specified on the stock certificate. In addition, the owners of 
preferred stock have first claim, after bond owners and general creditors, on corporate 
assets if the firm is dissolved or enters bankruptcy. These features make preferred stock

a more conservative investment with an added degree 
of safety and a more predictable source of income when 
compared with common stock.
In addition, owners of preferred stock may gain 
through special features offered with certain preferred-
stock issues. Owners of cumulative preferred stocks are 
assured that omitted dividends will be paid to them before 
common stockholders receive any dividends. Owners of 
convertible preferred stock may profit through growth 
as well as dividends. When the value of a firm’s common 
stock increases, the market value of its convertible preferred 
stock also increases. Convertible preferred stock thus combines 
the lower risk of preferred stock with the possibility of greater 
speculative gain through conversion to common stock.
Mutual Funds and Exchange-
Traded Funds
For many investors, mutual funds are the investment of choice. 
There are plenty of funds from which to choose. In 1970, there 
were only about 400 mutual funds. In January 2012, there were 
over 10,000 funds.5
According to the Mutual Fund Education Alliance (www 
.mfea.com), a mutual fund pools the money of many ­investors—
its shareholders—to invest in a variety of different securities.6 
The major advantages of a mutual fund are its professional man-
agement and its diversification, or investment in a wide variety 
of securities. Most investment companies do everything possible 
to convince you that they can do a better job of picking securi-
ties than you can. In reality, mutual funds are managed by pro-
fessional fund managers who devote large amounts of time to 
picking just the “right” securities for their funds’ portfolios. Be 
warned: Even the best portfolio managers make mistakes. So 
you, the investor, must be careful and evaluate different funds 
before investing. Diversification spells safety because an occasional loss incurred with 
one security is usually offset by gains from other investments.
Mutual-Fund Basics  There are basically three types of mutual funds: (1) open-end 
funds, (2) closed-end funds, and (3) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The investment 
company sponsoring an open-end fund issues and sells new shares to any investor who 
requests them. It also buys back shares from investors who wish to sell all or part of 
their holdings. A closed-end fund sells shares in the fund to investors only when the 
fund is originally organized. Once all the shares are sold, an investor must purchase 
shares from some other investor who is willing to sell them. The investment company 
is under no obligation to buy back shares from investors. 
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a fund that generally invests in the stocks 
or securities contained in a specific stock or securities index. Although most investors 
think of an ETF as investing in the stocks contained in the Standard & Poor’s 500 
Stock Index, there are many different types of ETFs available that attempt to track 
all kinds of indexes including different types of stocks, bonds, and even commodities. 
Exchange-traded funds tend to mirror the performance of a specific index, moving up 
or down as the individual stocks or securities contained in the index move up or down.
Like a closed-end fund, shares of an exchange-traded fund are traded on a securi-
ties exchange or in the over-the-counter market at any time during the business day. 
Although exchange-traded funds are similar to closed-end funds, there is an important 
difference. Most closed-end funds are actively managed, with portfolio managers mak-
ing the selection of stocks and other securities contained in a closed-end fund. Almost

net asset value (NAV)  current 
market value of a mutual fund’s 
portfolio minus the mutual fund’s 
liabilities divided by the number of 
outstanding shares
expense ratio  all the different 
management fees; 12b-1 fees, 
if any; and additional operating 
costs for a specific fund
all exchange-traded funds, on the other hand, normally invest in the stocks, bonds, 
or securities included in a specific index. Therefore, there is less need for a portfolio 
manager to make investment decisions. Because of passive management, fees associated 
with owning shares are generally less when compared to both closed-end and open-end 
funds. Although increasing in popularity, there are only about 1,100 exchange-traded 
funds.7
The share value for any mutual fund is determined by calculating its net asset value. 
Net asset value (NAV) per share is equal to the current market value of the mutual 
fund’s portfolio minus the mutual fund’s liabilities divided by the number of outstand-
ing shares. For most mutual funds, NAV is calculated once a day and is reported in 
newspapers and financial publications and on the Internet. Because ETFs and closed-
end funds trade like stocks, their shares trade at the current market value, which can be 
more or less than a closed-end fund's or ETF’s NAV. 
Mutual-Fund Sales Charges and Fees  With regard to costs, there are two types 
of mutual funds: load and no-load funds. An individual who invests in a load fund pays 
a sales charge every time he or she purchases shares. This charge may be as high as 
8.5 percent. Although many exceptions exist, the average load charge for mutual funds 
is between 3 and 5 percent. Instead of charging investors a fee when they purchase 
shares in a mutual fund, some funds charge a contingent deferred sales fee. Generally, 
this fee ranges from 1 to 5 percent of the amount withdrawn during the first five to 
seven years. Typically, the amount of the contingent deferred sales fee declines each 
year that you own the fund until there is no withdrawal fee. 
The purchaser of shares in a no-load fund pays no sales charges at all. Although 
some fund salespeople claim that load funds outperform no-load funds, there is no 
significant performance difference between funds that charge load charges (commis-
sions) and those that do not.8 Because no-load funds offer the same type of investment 
opportunities as load funds, you should investigate them further before deciding which 
type of mutual fund is best for you.
Mutual funds also collect a yearly management fee of about 0.25 to 1.5 percent of 
the total dollar amount of assets in the fund. Although fees vary considerably, the average 
management fee is between 0.50 and 1 percent of the fund’s assets. 
Finally, some mutual funds charge a 12b-1 fee (sometimes referred to 
as a distribution fee) to defray the costs of advertising and marketing 
the mutual fund. Annual 12b-1 fees are calculated on the value of a 
fund’s assets and cannot exceed 1 percent of the fund’s assets. Unlike 
the one-time sales fees that some mutual funds charge to purchase or 
sell mutual-fund shares, the management fee and the 12b-1 fee are 
ongoing fees charged each year. 
Together, all the different management fees; 12b-1 fees, if any; 
and additional operating costs for a specific fund are referred to as an 
expense ratio. As a guideline, many financial planners recommend that 
you choose a mutual fund with an expense ratio of 1 percent or less. To 
learn more about different mutual fund charges and fees, you should 
visit the Securities and Exchange Commission Web site at www.sec.gov.
Today, mutual funds can also be classified as A, B, or C shares. With 
A shares, investors pay commissions when they purchase shares in the 
mutual fund. With B shares, investors pay commissions when money is 
withdrawn or shares are sold during the first five to seven years. With 
C shares, investors often pay no commissions to buy or sell shares but 
usually must pay higher ongoing management and 12b-1 fees.
Managed Funds Versus Indexed Funds  Most mutual funds 
are managed funds. In other words, there is a professional fund 
manager (or team of managers) who chooses the securities that are 
contained in the fund. The fund manager also decides when to buy 
and sell securities in the fund.
How do you choose the right investment and 
financial company to help you obtain your 
financial goals? Beginning investors often see the 
investment world as a jungle because of the different 
investment alternatives and the large number of 
companies that want to help you invest. In reality, all 
investments and the companies that want to help you 
should be evaluated before you make any decisions on 
how and where to invest.

family of funds  a group of mutual 
funds managed by one investment 
company
Instead of investing in a managed fund, some investors choose to invest in an index 
fund. Why? The answer to this question is simple: Over many years, index funds have 
outperformed managed funds. The exact statistics vary depending on the year and the 
specific fund, but a common statistic is that the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index 
outperforms 80 percent of all mutual funds.9 Simply put: It is hard to beat an index 
such as the Standard & Poor’s 500. If the individual securities included in an index 
increase in value, the index goes up. Because an index fund contains the same securi-
ties as the index, the dollar value of a share in an index fund also increases when the 
index increases. Unfortunately, the reverse is also true. A second reason why investors 
choose index funds is the lower fees charged by these passively managed funds. (Note: 
Various indexes are discussed later in this chapter.)
Types of Mutual-Fund Investments  Based on the type of securities they invest 
in, mutual funds generally fall into three broad categories: stocks, bonds, and other. 
The majority of mutual funds are stock funds that invest in stocks issued by small, 
medium-size, and large corporations that provide investors with income, growth, or 
a combination of income and growth. Bond funds invest in corporate, government, 
or municipal bonds that provide investors with interest income. The third category 
includes funds that stress asset allocation and money-market investments or strive for 
a balance between stocks and bonds. In most cases, the name of the category gives a 
pretty good clue to the type of investments included in the fund. Typical fund names 
include:
●
●Aggressive growth stock funds
●
●Balanced funds
●
●Global stock funds
●
●Growth stock funds
●
●High-yield (junk) bond funds
●
●Income stock funds
●
●Index funds
●
●Life cycle funds
●
●Long-term U.S. bond funds
●
●Regional funds
●
●Sector stock funds
●
●Socially responsible funds
●
●Small-cap stock funds
To help investors obtain their investment objectives, most investment companies 
now allow shareholders to switch from one fund to another fund within the same family 
of funds. A family of funds exists when one investment company manages a group of 
mutual funds. For example, shareholders, at their option, can change from the Fidelity 
International Growth Fund to the Fidelity Small-Cap Discovery Fund. Generally, inves-
tors may give instructions to switch from one fund to another fund within the same 
family either in writing, over the telephone, or via the Internet. Charges for exchanges, 
if any, are small for each transaction.
Real Estate
Real estate ownership represents one of the best hedges against inflation, but like 
all investments it has its risks. A piece of property in a poor location, for example, 
can actually decrease in value. Table 20.5 lists some of the many factors you should 
consider before investing in real estate.
There are, of course, disadvantages to any investment, and real estate is no excep-
tion. If you want to sell your property, you must find an interested buyer with the abil-
ity to obtain enough money to complete the transaction. Finding such a buyer can be 
difficult if loan money is scarce, the real estate market is in a decline, or you overpaid 
for a piece of property. For example, many real estate investors were forced to hold 
some properties longer than they wanted because buyers could not obtain financing

during the recent economic crisis. If you are forced to hold your investment longer 
than you originally planned, taxes, interest, and installment payments can be a heavy 
burden. As a rule, real estate increases in value and eventually sells at a profit, but 
there are no guarantees. The degree of your success depends on how well you evaluate 
different alternatives.
The Most Speculative Investment Techniques
A high-risk investment is one made in the uncertain hope of earning a relatively 
large profit in a short time. (See the most speculative investments category in 
Table  20.2.) Although all investments have some risk, some investments become 
high-risk because of the methods used by investors to earn a quick profit. These 
methods can lead to large losses as well as to impressive gains. They should not 
be used by anyone who does not fully understand the risks involved. We begin this 
section with a discussion of selling short. Then we examine margin transactions and 
other high-risk investments.
Selling Short  Normally, you buy stocks expecting that they will increase in value 
and then can be sold at a profit. This procedure is referred to as buying long. However, 
many securities decrease in value for various reasons. The market value for a share of 
a corporation’s stock, for example, can decrease when sales and profits are lower than 
expected. When this type of situation occurs, you can use a procedure called selling 
short to make a profit when the price of an individual stock is falling. Selling short is 
the process of selling stock that an investor does not actually own but has borrowed 
from a brokerage firm and will repay at a later date. The idea is to sell at today’s higher 
price and then buy later at a lower price. To make a profit from a short transaction, 
you must proceed as follows:
	 1.	Arrange to borrow a certain number of shares of a particular stock from a broker-
age firm.
	 2.	Sell the borrowed stock immediately, assuming that the price of the stock will drop 
in a reasonably short time.
	 3.	After the price drops, buy the same number of shares that were sold in step 2.
	 4.	Give the newly purchased stock to the brokerage firm in return for the stock 
­borrowed in step 1.

Real Estate Checklist
Although real estate offers one of the best hedges against inflation, not all property 
increases in value. Many factors should be considered before investing in real estate.
 
Evaluation of Property
Inspection of the 
Surrounding Neighborhood
 
Other Factors
Is the property priced 
competitively with similar 
property?
What are the present 
zoning requirements?
Why are the present owners 
selling the property?
What type of financing,  
if any, is available?
Is the neighborhood’s 
population increasing  
or decreasing?
How long will you have to 
hold the property before 
selling it to someone else?
How much are the taxes?
What is the average income 
of people in the area?
How much profit can 
you reasonably expect to 
obtain?
How much will it cost 
to repair or remodel a 
property?
What is the state of repair 
of surrounding property? 
Do most of the buildings 
and homes need repair?
Is there a chance that 
the property value will 
decrease?

margin requirement  the portion 
of the price of a stock that cannot 
be borrowed
Your profit is the difference between the amount received when the stock is sold in 
step 2 and the amount paid for the stock in step 3. For example, assume that you think 
Barnes & Noble stock is overvalued at $18 a share. You also believe that the stock will 
decrease in value over the next three to four months. In this example, you can make 
money with a short transaction—if the stock’s value does decline. On the other hand, 
if the market value for a share of Barnes & Noble increases, you lose.
Buying Stock on Margin  An investor buys stock on margin by borrowing part of 
the purchase price, usually from a stock brokerage firm. The margin requirement 
is the portion of the price of a stock that cannot be borrowed. This requirement is set 
by the Federal Reserve Board.
Today, the current margin requirement is 50 percent, which means you can 
borrow up to 50 percent of the cost of a stock purchase. Some securities exchanges 
and brokerage firms may impose other restrictions and require that you deposit 
more cash, which reduces the percentage that can be borrowed. However, why 
would investors want to buy stock on margin? Simply because they can buy up to 
twice as much stock that way. Suppose that an investor expects the market price of 
a share of common stock of American Electric Power Corporation—a U.S. energy 
company—to increase in the next three to four months. Assume you have enough 
money to purchase 200 shares of the stock. However, if you buy on margin, you can 
purchase an additional 200 shares for a total of 400 shares. If the price of American 
Electric Power’s stock increases by $8 per share, your profit will be $1,600 ($8 3 
200 5 $1,600) if you pay cash. But it will be $3,200 ($8 3 400 5 $3,200) if you 
buy the stock using margin. By buying more shares on margin, you will earn more 
profit (less the interest you pay on the borrowed money and customary commis-
sion charges).
Note that the stock purchased on margin serves as collateral for the borrowed 
funds. Before you become a margin investor, you should consider two factors. First, if 
the market price of the purchased stock does not increase as quickly as expected, inter-
est costs mount and eventually drain your profit. Second, if the price of the margined 
stock falls, your dollar loss will be greater because you own more shares.
If the value of a stock you bought on margin decreases to approximately 60 per-
cent of its original price, you may receive a margin call from the brokerage firm. You 
then must provide additional cash or securities to serve as collateral for the borrowed 
money. If you cannot provide additional collateral, the stock is sold, and the proceeds 
are used to pay off the loan and commissions. Any funds remaining after the loan and 
commissions are paid off are returned to you.
Other High-Risk Investments  We have already discussed two 
high-risk investments—selling short and margin transactions. Other 
high-risk investments include the following:
●
●Stock options
●
●Derivatives
●
●Commodities
●
●Precious metals
●
●Gemstones
●
●Coins
●
●Antiques and collectibles
Without exception, investments of this kind are normally 
referred to as high-risk investments for one reason or another. For 
example, the gold market has many unscrupulous dealers who sell 
worthless gold-plated lead coins to unsuspecting, uninformed inves-
tors. It pays to be careful. Although investments in this category can 
lead to large dollar gains, they should not be used by anyone who 
does not fully understand all the potential risks involved.
Is gold a conservative or a high-risk investment?  
Good question. When purchased from reputable 
dealers, gold can be a conservative investment—
especially in troubled economic times. And yet, there 
are many unscrupulous dealers who sell worthless 
gold-plated coins to unsuspecting investors who want 
to make a fast buck. The final answer:  Consider 
the potential risks for a conservative or high-risk

Sources of Financial Information
A wealth of information is available to investors. Sources include the Internet, 
professional advisory services, newspapers, brokerage firm reports, business periodicals, 
corporate reports, and securities averages.
The Internet
By using the Internet, investors can access a wealth of information on most investment 
and personal finance topics. For example, you can obtain interest rates for CDs; current 
price information for stocks, bonds, and mutual funds; and experts’ recommendations 
to buy, hold, or sell an investment. You can even trade securities online.
Because the Internet makes so much information available, you need to use it 
selectively. One of the Web search engines such as Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) or Google 
(www.google.com) can help you locate the information you really need. These search 
engines allow you to do a word search for the personal finance topic or investment 
alternative you want to explore. Why not take a look? To access a search engine, enter 
the Web site address and then type in a key term such as personal finance or financial 
planning and see the results. In addition to using a search engine to locate information, 
you can also obtain information from a number of investment sites. For example, the 
Web sites described in Table 20.6 are often used by successful investors.
Corporations; brokerage firms; investment companies that sponsor mutual 
funds; real estate brokers and agents; and federal, state, and local governments also 
have Web sites where you can obtain valuable investment information. You may 
want to explore the information available on the Internet for two reasons. First, 
these sites are easily accessible. All you have to do is type in the Web address or use 
a search engine to locate the site. Second, the information on these sites may be more 
up-to-date than printed material obtained from published sources. Today, many of 
the above sources of information also use social media to connect with investors.
Charles Schwab, for example, uses Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to reach exist-
ing and potential clients.
In addition, you can access professional advisory services—a topic discussed in 
the next section—for information on stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other invest-
ment alternatives. Although some of the information provided by these services is 
free, there is a charge for the more detailed information you may need to evaluate 
an investment.

Professional Advisory Services
For a fee, various professional advisory services provide 
information about investments. Information from these 
services may also be available at university and public 
libraries.
As discussed earlier in this chapter, Moody’s, 
Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch Ratings provide infor-
mation that can be used to determine the quality and 
risk associated with bond issues. Standard & Poor’s, 
Mergent, Inc., and Value Line also rate the companies that 
issue stock. Each investor service provides detailed financial 
reports. Take a look at the Mergent’s research report for 
Dollar Tree, Inc., illustrated in Figure 20.1. Notice that there 
are main sections that provide financial data, summary infor-
mation about the company’s business operations, recent devel-
opments, prospects, and other valuable information. Research 
reports published by Standard & Poor’s and Value Line are 
like the Mergent’s report and provide similar information.
A number of professional advisory services provide detailed 
information on mutual funds. Morningstar, Inc., Standard & 
Poor’s, Lipper Analytical Services, and Value Line are four widely 
tapped sources for such information. Although some informa-
tion may be free, a fee is generally charged for more detailed 
research reports. In addition, various mutual-fund newsletters 
supply financial information to subscribers for a fee.
Financial Coverage of Securities  
Transactions
Many local newspapers carry several pages of business news, including reports of 
securities transactions. The Wall Street Journal (published on weekdays) and Barron’s 
(published once a week) are devoted almost entirely to financial and economic news. 
Both include coverage of transactions on major securities exchanges.
Because transactions involving stocks, bonds, and mutual funds are reported dif-
ferently, we examine each type of report separately.
Common and Preferred Stocks  Stock transactions are reported in tables that 
usually look like the top section of Figure 20.2. Stocks are listed alphabetically. Your 
first task is to move down the table to find the stock you are interested in. To read the 
stock quotation, you read across the table. The highlighted line in Figure 20.2 gives 
detailed information about common stock issued by Aflac—the insurance company 
with the talking duck.
Bonds  Although some newspapers and financial publications provide limited infor-
mation on certain corporate and government bond issues, it is usually easier to obtain 
more detailed information on a greater number of bond issues by accessing the Internet. 
Regardless of the source, bond prices are quoted as a percentage of the face value, 
which is usually $1,000. Thus, to find the current price, you must multiply the face 
value ($1,000) by the quotation. For example, a price quoted as 84 translates to a sell-
ing price of $840 ($1,000 3 84% 5 $840). Detailed information obtained from the 
Yahoo! Finance Web site for a $1,000 AT&T corporate bond, which pays 5.50 percent 
interest and matures in 2018, is provided in Figure 20.3.
Mutual Funds  Purchases and sales of shares of mutual funds are reported in tables 
like the one shown in Figure 20.4. As in reading stock quotations, your first task is to 
move down the table to find the mutual fund you are interested in. Then, to find the 
mutual-fund price quotation, read across the table. The first line in Figure 20.4 gives 
information for the Vanguard 500 Index mutual fund.

There is more to successful investing than just luck! In 
fact, you must “invest” the time needed to research stocks, 
bonds, mutual funds, and other alternatives before you 
invest your money. And in order to be a “best” investor, 
you’ll need to continue to evaluate each investment.
Continued evaluation can help you decide if you want 
to hold, sell, or buy more of each investment in your 
investment portfolio.

Business Summary: Retail - General Merchandise/Department Stores (MIC: 2.1.1 SIC: 5331 NAIC: 452990)
Dollar Tree is an operator of discount variety stores providing merchandise at the fixed price of $1.00. Co.’s merchandise mix consists of consumable merchandise, 
which includes candy and food, health and beauty care, and household consumables; variety merchandise, which includes toys, housewares, gifts, party goods, greeting 
cards, softlines, and other items; and seasonal goods, which include Easter, Halloween and Christmas merchandise. At Jan 29 2011, Co. operates 4.015 stores in 48 
states and the District of Columbia, as well as 86 stores in Canada under the Dollar Tree, Deal$, Dollar Tree Deal$, Dollar Giant and Dollar Bills names.
Recent Developments: For the quarter ended Oct 29 2011, net income increased 12.1% to US$104.5 million from US$93.2 million in the year-earlier quarter. Revenues 
were US$1.60 billion, up 11.9% from US$1.43 billion the year before. Operating income was US$164.9 million versus US$140.9 million in the prior-year quarter, an in-
crease of 17.0%. Direct operating expenses rose 12.5% to US$1.04 billion from US$920.6 million in the comparable period the year before. Indirect operating expenses 
increased 8.4% to US$395.7 million from US$365.1 million in the equivalent prior-year period.
Prospects: Our evaluation of Dollar Tree Inc. as of Dec. 11, 2011 is the result of our systematic analysis on three basic characteristics; earnings strength, relative 
valuation, and recent stock price movement. The company has produced a positive trend in earnings per share over the past 5 quarters and while recent estimates for 
the company have been raised by analysts, DLTR has posted better than expected results. Based on operating earnings yield, the company is about fairly valued when 
­compared to all of the companies in our coverage universe. Share price changes over the past year indicates that DLTR will perform well over the near term.

Other Sources of Financial Information
In addition to the Internet, professional advisory services, and financial and newspaper 
coverage, other sources, which include brokerage firm reports, business periodicals, 
corporate reports, and securities averages offer information about investment alternatives.
Brokerage Firm Analysts’ Reports  Brokerage firms employ financial analysts to 
prepare detailed reports on individual corporations and their securities. Such reports 
are based on the corporation’s sales, profits or losses, management, and planning, plus 
other information on the company, its industry, demand for its products, its efforts to 
develop new products, and the current economic environment. The reports, which may 
include buy or sell recommendations, are usually provided free to the clients of full-
service brokerage firms. Brokerage firm reports may also be available from discount 
brokerage firms, although they may charge a fee.
Business Periodicals  Business magazines such as Bloomberg Businessweek, 
Fortune, and Forbes provide not only general economic news but also detailed 
financial information about individual corporations. Trade or industry publications 
such as Advertising Age include information about firms in a specific industry. News 
magazines such as U.S. News & World Report, Time, and Newsweek feature finan-
cial news regularly. Money, Kiplinger’s Personal Finance Magazine, Smart Money, 
and similar magazines provide information and advice designed to improve your 
investment skills. These periodicals are available at libraries and are sold at news-
stands and by subscription. Many of these same periodicals sponsor an online Web 
site that may contain all or selected articles that are contained in the print version.

prospectus  a detailed, written 
description of a new security, 
the issuing corporation, and the 
corporation’s top management
security average (or security 
index)  an average of the current 
market prices of selected securities
Corporate Reports  Publicly held corporations must publish annual reports which 
include a description of the company’s performance, information about the firm’s 
products or services, and detailed financial statements that readers can use to evaluate 
the firm’s actual performance. There should also be a letter from the accounting firm 
that audited the corporation. As mentioned in Chapter 17, an audit does not guarantee 
that a company has not “cooked” the books, but it does imply that the company has 
followed generally accepted accounting principles to report revenues, profits, assets, 
liabilities, and other financial information.
In addition, a corporation issuing a new security must—by law—prepare a prospectus 
and ensure that copies are distributed to potential investors. A prospectus is a detailed, 
written description of a new security, the issuing corporation, and the corporation’s top 
management. A corporation’s prospectus and its annual reports are available to the gen-
eral public. You can request both an annual report and a prospectus by mail or telephone. 
In addition you can obtain an annual report, prospectus, or other financial information 
online. It’s simple: Go to the corporation’s Web site and click on “Investor Relations.”

Investors often gauge the stock market through the security averages reported in 
newspapers and on television news programs. A security average (or security index)
is an average of the current market prices of selected securities. For example, the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average and the Standard & Poor 500 Stock Index are both used by 
investors to track the U.S. stock market. Today, there are averages for not only stocks, but 
also averages for bonds, U.S. Treasury securities, mutual funds, real estate, commodities, 
natural resources, and many popular investments. Over a period of time, these averages 
indicate price trends, but they do not predict the performance of individual investments. 
At best, they can give the investor a “feel” for what is happening to investment prices.

You’ll Need a License to Trade
© stoupa/Shutterstock
Thinking about a career in the securities 
industry? You’ll need a license (or more than 
one) to work with investors and place trades on 
their behalf—which means taking challenging tests 
prepared by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). 
The higher you move in a brokerage firm, the more licenses you’ll 
need to offer a broader range of securities and to supervise other 
employees who work with investors and investment accounts.
As an entry-level account executive with a firm like Charles 
Schwab or Raymond James, you’ll need to pass the Series 7 
exam for General Securities Representatives. The good news: 
The two-part test contains only multiple-choice questions. The 
bad news: Each part is three hours long, which means you’ll 
sit through six hours of testing to complete the entire exam. 
You’ll need to answer at least 72 percent of the questions 
correctly to earn a passing grade.
Although the exact questions differ from year to year, one set 
of questions typically covers securities such as stocks, bonds, and 
mutual funds. Another set tests your understanding of various 
accounts, including individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 
employer-sponsored retirement accounts like 401(k) accounts. 
A third set of questions focuses on regulatory rules, such as 
the disclosures you’re required to provide to investors. Finally, 
you’ll have to answer questions that test what you know about 
securities markets and financial management—big-picture 
information you will need to help your clients choose the right 
investments to meet their particular needs.

Part 7   Finance and Investment
how successful investors are involved in their investment program, and conservative 
and speculative investment alternatives. Then, in the last section, we discussed how you 
can evaluate different investment alternatives in order to make an informed decision 
to buy or sell an investment. Once you understand the information in the previous 
sections and have researched a potential investment, you can use the options described 
in this section to buy or sell an investment.
Purchasing Stocks and Bonds
To purchase a Geoffrey Beene sweater, you simply walk into a store that sells these 
sweaters, choose one, and pay for it. To purchase stocks and bonds, you work through a 
brokerage firm. In turn, an employee of the brokerage firm buys or sells securities for you.
Brokerage Firms and Account Executives  An account executive—sometimes 
called a stockbroker or registered representative—is an individual who buys and sells 
securities for clients. Before choosing an account executive, you should have already 
determined your investment goals. Then you must be careful to communicate these goals 
to the account executive so that she or he can do a better job of advising you. You must 
also decide whether you need a full-service broker or a discount broker. A full-service 
broker usually charges higher commissions when compared to a discount broker. To help 
decide if you should use a full-service or a discount brokerage firm, you should con-
sider how much help you need when making an investment decision. Many full-service 
brokerage firms argue that you need a professional to help you make important invest-
ment decisions. Although this may be true for some investors, most account executives 
employed by full-service brokerage firms are too busy to spend unlimited time with you 
on a one-on-one basis, especially if you are investing a small amount. On the other side, 
many discount brokerage firms argue that you alone are responsible for making your 
investment decisions. Furthermore, they argue that discount brokerage firms have both 
the personnel and research materials to help you to become a better investor.
The Mechanics of a Transaction  Once you decide on a particular stock or bond, 
you can telephone your account executive or use the Internet to place a market or limit 
order. A market order is a request that a security be purchased or sold at the current 
market price. Figure 20.5 illustrates one method of executing a market order to sell a 
stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at its current market value. It 
is also possible for a brokerage firm to match a buy order for a security for one of its 
Although not quite a horse race, a typical stock transaction takes only about  
20 minutes.

customers with a sell order for the same security from another of 
its customers. Matched orders are not completed through a security 
exchange or the over-the-counter market. Regardless of how the 
security is bought or sold, payment for stocks, bonds, and many 
other financial securities generally is required within three business 
days of the transaction.
A limit order is a request that a security be bought or sold at 
a price equal to or better than (lower for buying, higher for selling) 
some specified price. Suppose that you place a limit order to sell 
Coca-Cola common stock at $70 per share. Your broker’s representa-
tive sells the stock only if the price is $70 per share or higher. If you 
place a limit order to buy Coca Cola at $70, the representative buys 
it only if the price is $70 per share or lower. Usually, a limit order is 
good for one day, one week, one month, or good until canceled.
Commissions  Most brokerage firms have a minimum commis-
sion ranging from $7 to $25 for buying and selling stock. Additional 
commission charges are based on the number of shares and the 
value of stock bought and sold.
Table 20.7 shows typical commission fees charged by online 
brokerage firms. Generally, online transactions are less expensive 
when compared with the costs of trading securities through a full-
service brokerage firm. As a rule of thumb, full-service brokerage 
firms charge as much as 1 to 2 percent of the transaction amount. 
Commissions for trading bonds, commodities, and options are usu-
ally lower than those for trading stocks.
Purchasing Mutual Funds, Real 
Estate, and Other Investments
The method used to buy or sell mutual funds depends on the type 
of fund you choose. Open-end funds, for example, can be purchased 
or sold directly from the investment company that sponsors the 
fund on any business day. Both closed-end funds and exchange-
traded funds can be purchased or sold on any business day through 
a securities exchange or the over-the-counter market.  The amount 
of sales charge also depends on the type of fund you purchase. The 
sales charge for load funds can be as high as 8 1/2 percent. For a 
load fund, the sales charge can be charged when you make a purchase or when you 
withdraw money from the fund. If you purchase a no-load fund, there is no sales charge. 
When purchasing shares in a load fund, you usually pay commission to buy or sell 
shares—but not to buy and sell shares. Reminder: For fund investments, you will also 
pay other fees that are usually assessed each year.
Although it is possible to buy or sell real estate without a real estate agent or broker, 
these professionals are involved in most transactions. Finding an agent or broker that can

Case closed—150 years in prison. The common phrase 
“Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time,” explains 
why Bernard “Bernie” Madoff looks so unhappy in 
this photo. Mr. Madoff was found guilty of securities

Bernie Madoff who will spend the rest of his life in prison.

help you to either buy or sell an investment is especially important because she or he can 
provide professional advice, realistic market values for different properties, and help com-
pleting the transaction. You should expect to pay commissions when you sell a property.
A broker (or account executive) is usually involved in the purchase or sell of the most 
speculative investment alternatives listed in Table 20.2. For example, brokers can help you 
purchase commodities and precious metals. It is especially important to “know” the person 
you are dealing with when purchasing many of the speculative investments because of the 
potential for fraud and misrepresentation. It pays to be careful.
It should be apparent that vast sums of money are involved in securities trading. 
In an effort to protect investors from unfair treatment, both federal and state govern-
ments have acted to regulate securities trading.
Regulation of Securities Trading
Government regulation of securities was begun as a response to abusive and fraudulent 
practices in the sale of stocks, bonds, and other financial securities. Today, with so many 
news reports of banks with a portfolio of bad loans and of corporations that are in “hot 
water” over financial reporting problems that range from simple mistakes to out-and-
out fraud, the concerns of both government officials and investors have grown.
Today, a regulatory pyramid consisting of four different levels exists to make sure 
that investors are protected. The U.S. Congress is at the top of the pyramid. Early 
on, Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933 (sometimes referred to as the Truth in 
Securities Act). This act provides for full disclosure. Full disclosure means that inves-
tors should have access to all important facts about stocks, bonds, and other securities 
so that they can make informed decisions. This act also requires that corporations 
issuing new securities file a registration statement and publish a prospectus. Since 
1933, Congress has passed additional legislation that includes creating the Securities 
Investor Protection Corporation to protect investors. Congress also has passed legis-
lation to curb insider-trading abuses. Insider trading occurs when insiders—board 
members, corporate managers, and employees—buy and sell a corporation’s stock. 
Although insiders can buy and sell a corporation’s stock, they must disclose their trad-
ing activities to the public. More recently, Congress passed the Sarbanes–Oxley Act to 
improve corporate accountability and financial reporting (see Chapter 17).
On the next level of the regulatory pyramid is the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC), created in 1934 by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC 
is the agency that enforces federal securities regulations. The SEC also supervises all 
national exchanges, investment companies, the OTC market, brokerage firms, and just 
about every other organization involved in trading securities.
On the next level of the regulatory pyramid are individual states. Today, most 
states require that new security issues be registered with a state agency and that bro-
kerage firms, brokers, and investment advisors operating within the state be licensed. 
Most state regulations also provide for the prosecution of individuals accused of the 
fraudulent sale of stocks, bonds, and other securities.
The foundation and most important level of the regulatory pyramid is self-regu-
lation by securities exchanges and brokerage firms. According to the NYSE, self-reg-
ulation—the way the securities industry monitors itself to create a fair and orderly 
trading environment—begins here.10 To provide guidelines of ethical behavior, the 
NYSE has published rules, policies, and standards of conduct. These standards are 
applied to every member in the NYSE’s investment community. The NYSE also con-
ducts a thorough examination of each member firm that does business with the pub-
lic at least once a year.11 In addition, there are more than 300 brokerage firms that 
buy and sell securities for their customers. These firms are responsible for ensuring 
that their employees are highly trained and meet rigorous ethical standards.
Before they can start investing, most people have to decide on a career and obtain 
a job that will provide the money needed to finance an investment program. To help 
you find the right job (and the money needed to fund an investment program), read 
Appendix A where we provide information that can help you to explore different 
career options (see text Web site @ www.cengagebrain.com).

Inside
Business
Whether investors call the Vanguard Group, visit one of 
its offices, log onto its Web site, or use its apps, they’ll 
find a wealth of information, tools, and advice to help 
them manage their investments and achieve their financial 
goals. Best-known for its low-cost index funds, Vanguard 
also offers brokerage services, retirement planning ser-
vices, college investment accounts, and research and 
educational information for individuals. In addition, it 
manages pension funds for companies and for nonprofit 
organizations such as colleges and hospitals.
Because of Vanguard’s long-time focus on mutual 
funds, it didn’t begin offering exchange-traded funds 
(ETFs) until 2001, again keeping costs low as it does with 
its mutual funds. Now the company has become the third-
largest U.S. provider of ETFs, and more than 45 percent of 
the funds it receives from clients flow into its ETFs—add-
ing up to more than $200 billion in EFT assets. 
Questions
1.	 When investing for a long-term goal such as retire-
ment, how are the costs associated with your invest-
ments likely to affect your results? Explain your 
answer in terms of this chapter’s concepts.
2.	 As an investor, what questions would you like to ask 
a Vanguard representative? How do these questions 
relate to your financial goals?

The Vanguard Group
Explain why you should manage your personal 
finances and develop a personal investment 
program.
Many personal finance experts recommend that you begin 
the process of managing your money by determining your 
current financial condition. The first step often is to construct 
a personal income statement sheet and a personal balance 
sheet. You can also construct a personal budget. Before you 
begin investing, you must manage your credit card debts. 
For most people, the next step is to formulate realistic 
investment goals. A personal investment program then is 
designed to implement these goals. Many financial planners 
also suggest that the investor should establish an emergency 
fund equivalent to at least three months’ living expenses. 
However, you may want to increase your emergency fund 
in anticipation of a crisis. Then additional funds may be 
invested according to the investment program. Finally, all 
investments should be monitored carefully, and if necessary, 
the investment program should be modified.
Describe how the factors of safety, risk, income, 
growth, and liquidity affect your investment 
program.
Depending on their particular investment goals, investors 
seek varying degrees of safety, risk, income, growth, and 
liquidity from their investments. Safety is, in essence, 
freedom from the risk of loss. Generally, the greater the risk, 
the greater should be the potential return on an investment. 
To determine how much risk you are willing to assume, 
many investors calculate the rate of return. It is also possible 
to compare the rate of return for different investments that 
offer more or less risk. Income is the periodic return from 
an investment. Growth is an increase in the value of the 
investment. Liquidity is the ease with which an asset can be 
converted to cash.
Recognize how you can reduce investment risk 
and increase investment returns.
The investments in your investment portfolio should be 
tailored to your goals, age, tolerance for risk, and financial 
resources. Asset allocation is the process of spreading your 
money among several different types of investments to lessen 
risk. Two other factors—the time your investments have to 
work for you and your age—should also be considered before 
deciding where to invest your money. To reduce investment 
risk and increase the returns on your investments, you should 
evaluate potential investments before investing your money, 
monitor the value of your investments on a regular basis, and 
keep accurate and current records.
Explain the reasons people choose conservative 
investments including bank accounts and bonds.

include bank accounts, government bonds, and corporate 
bonds. Although bank accounts and bonds can provide

Part 7   Finance and Investment
investment growth, they are generally purchased by 
investors who seek a predictable source of income. There 
are a number of different types of bonds and securities 
issued by both the U.S. government (see Table 20.3) and 
local governments. There are also a number of different 
types of corporate bonds. Both government and corporate 
bonds are a form of debt financing. As a result, bonds 
are generally considered a more conservative investment 
than stocks, mutual funds, or other more speculative 
investments. 
Identify the advantages and disadvantages of 
stocks, mutual funds, real estate, and more 
speculative investments.
With stock investments, investors can make money through 
dividend payments, an increase in the market value of the 
stock, or stock splits. The major advantages of mutual-fund 
investments are professional management and diversification. 
Today, there are mutual funds to meet just about any 
conceivable investment objective. The success of real estate 
investments is often tied to how well each investment alternative 
is evaluated. High-risk investment techniques can provide 
greater returns, but they also entail greater risk of loss. You 
can make money by selling short when the market value of a 
financial security decreases. An investor can also buy stock on 
margin by borrowing part of the purchase price, usually from 
a stock brokerage firm. Because you can purchase up to twice 
as much stock by using margin, you can increase your return 
on investment as long as the stock’s market value increases. 
Other high-risk investments include stock options, derivatives, 
commodities, gemstones, precious metals, antiques, coins, and 
collectibles.
Use financial information to evaluate investment 
alternatives.
Today, there is a wealth of information on stocks, bonds, 
and other securities and the firms that issue them. There is 
also a wealth of investment information on other types of 
investments, including mutual funds, real estate, and high-
risk investment alternatives. Two popular sources—the 
Internet and newspapers—report daily securities transactions. 
5
6
The Internet can also be used to obtain detailed research 
information about different investment alternatives. Often, 
the most detailed research information about securities—
and the most expensive—is obtained from professional 
advisory services. In addition, brokerage firm reports, 
business periodicals, and corporate reports can also be used 
to evaluate different investment alternatives. Finally, there 
are a number of security indexes or averages that indicate 
price trends but reveal nothing about the performance of 
individual securities.
Understand how different investments are bought 
and sold.
If you invest in stocks and bonds, chances are that you will 
use the services of an account executive who works for a 
brokerage firm. It is also possible to use a discount broker 
or trade securities online with a computer. Both a market 
order and a limit order can be used to purchase stocks on a 
securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market. Full-
service brokerage firms usually charge higher commissions 
than discount brokerage firms. With the exception of mutual 
funds and real estate, you generally pay a commission to 
buy and sell stocks, bonds, commodities, and most other 
investments.
The method used to buy or sell mutual funds depends 
on the type of fund you choose. Open-end funds, for exam-
ple, can be purchased or sold directly from the investment 
company that sponsors the fund on any business day. Both 
closed-end funds and exchange-traded funds can be pur-
chased or sold on any business day through a securities 
exchange or the over-the-counter market. While it is pos-
sible to buy or sell real estate without the help of an agent 
or broker, most investors rely on the professional advice 
provided by agents and brokers to help complete a real 
estate transaction.
Today, a regulatory pyramid consisting of four different 
levels exists to make sure that investors are protected. The 
U.S. Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC), individual states, and securities exchanges and bro-
kerage firms are all involved in regulating the securities 
industry.

Discussion Questions
Danny Kofke and his family have purchased some pretty nice 
things for themselves over the years. They own a lovely home 
that is about half paid for and have taken nice vacations to 
places like Europe. He and his wife, Tracy, recently bought a 
new washer, dryer, refrigerator, and 50-inch flat-screen TV. For 
the past seven years, Tracy has been able to stay at home to 
raise their children.
How have the Kofkes, who are only in their thirties, managed 
to live so well—especially in today’s tough economy? Are they 
members of the 1 percent?  Is Danny a highly paid executive or a 
Wall Street banker, perhaps? 
Not hardly. Danny is actually a special-needs teacher who 
earns just a little over $40,000 a year. That’s about $10,000 less 
than the average family in the United States makes. He and Tracy 
have figured out how to live well by paying careful attention to 
their finances. If the Kofkes stick to their financial plan, they are 
on track to retire with a million dollars or more. 
Having a budget has been critical to their success. “The biggest 
mistake people make when it comes to their money is that they 
don’t keep track of it, and they don’t know how they are spending 
it,” Danny explains. Sticking to the budget is also important. The 
Kofkes carefully prioritize their spending. They don’t buy things 
they don’t really want or need just because other people have 
them. “Don’t worry about what your neighbors think,” he says. 
“I know that’s hard today when everybody feels like they have to 
keep up with the Joneses.” 
Trevor Thomas and his wife, Michelle, are good managers of 
their money as well. Like the Kofkes, they are diligent budgeters. 
“A budget can help keep you from overspending during any par-
ticular income period or in any particular area,” says Trevor. It 
can help you plan for non-regular expenses, such as car repairs, 
and help you plan for your financial future.” The rising price of 
gas and food are two areas the Thomases’ budget has helped 
with. “We are a family of six, so these increases have hit us hard,”

he says. But by examining their budget, he and Michelle were 
able to figure out how to adjust their spending. As a result, they 
haven’t run up debt on their credit cards like other people with-
out a budget might have done.
In fact, not only do the Thomases have no credit card debt, 
they don’t even have a mortgage on their home. After paying off 
all of their consumer debt, they regularly saved as much money as 
they could. They then built an impressive two-story home bit-by-
bit over the course of a three-and-a-half-year period. “We built it 
from the ground up, contracting it and financing it completely by 
ourselves,” Trevor says. 
The difference between people who carry credit card debt and 
those who don’t is that the people without it don’t feel deprived 
when they can’t have everything they want right away, says Bedda 
D’Angelo, a certified financial planner. “They’re not cheap. 
They’re just not willing to pay for things they don’t need and 
haven’t saved for.” They also don’t lie awake at night wondering 
how they are going to pay their bills.
The Kofkes admit they have been teased a time or two by peo-
ple who think they are tightwads. They don’t let it get them down, 
though. In today’s debt-addicted world, where so many people, 
businesses, and even governments are broke, they’re happy not to 
be under a monster-load of debt. “Do what’s right for you and 
your family,” Danny advises. “If people who don’t do well man-
aging their money—if they are laughing at you and telling you to 
change—then you must be doing something right.”12
Questions
1.	 Is all debt bad? When does going into debt make sense?
2.	 Why is it so important for people to save and invest when 
they are young?
3.	 What steps can you take now to improve your financial outlook?
Boston-based Fidelity Investments wants its 20 million custom-
ers to be able to manage their money and receive responsive 
assistance from anywhere at any time. Whether customers use an 
iPad or Android app, tweet for customer service, transfer money 
electronically, use online chat for service, call a broker, or place 
orders through the company’s Web site, Fidelity is ready to help 
around the clock. 
Founded in 1946, Fidelity now has 39,000 employees world-
wide and offers 524 mutual funds that hold a total of $3.6 trillion 
in assets from individuals and institutional investors. Its mutual 
funds fall into four main categories: money market, stocks, bonds, 
and international securities. Fidelity is best known for its managed 
funds, such as the Contrafund and the Magellan Fund, although it 
also offers many indexed stock and bond funds. Over the years, it 
has expanded into a wide range of other financial services, includ-
ing discount brokerage services, college savings accounts, credit 
cards, checking accounts, and online bill payment. Fidelity is also 
the country’s largest administrator of 401(k) retirement accounts, 
handling retirement plans for more than 19,000 corporations, edu-
cational institutions, and nonprofit groups. 
When the financial markets are open, Fidelity completes 
345,000 securities trades per day for its customers. More than 
3 million customers click on its user-friendly Web site every day 
to read analysts’ reports, learn about investment and account 
options, view market update webinars, monitor their portfolios, or 
place a trade. For in-person service and advice, customers can visit 
one of the 168 Fidelity Investor Centers around the United States 
or attend a local seminar featuring Fidelity’s investment experts. 
Technology has always been one of Fidelity’s strengths, so it’s 
not surprising that the company has a Facebook page with 55,000 
“likes” and a Twitter account with 48,000 followers. “Our expecta-
tion is that over time, we’ll be interacting with not tens of thou-
sands, but millions of people on these channels,” says Fidelity’s 
head of digital distribution. On the company’s Web site, customers 
are invited to rate brokerage products and services for convenience, 
value, and features on a scale of one to five stars. In addition, they 
can write detailed reviews of what they like and don’t like. This 
allows investors to see what other investors think, as well as giving 
Fidelity vital feedback and fresh ideas for new products. 
Given Fidelity’s diverse menu of offerings, “The time has 
arrived when a lot of people can do very well with a firm like 
Fidelity for all of their cash management [needs],” says a senior 
executive. For example, customers can deposit checks to non-
retirement accounts using a smart phone app, and withdraw 
money from any local bank’s ATM—Fidelity pays the ATM fee. In 
fact, customers now click to make 7 million transfers of money to 
or from Fidelity accounts every year, a number that is growing as 
customers shift more of their personal finances to Fidelity.
Are young people going to have the money they need to enjoy 
retirement decades in the future? Fidelity’s research shows that, 
thanks to new U.S. laws, more employees are being automatically 
enrolled in their employers’ retirement plans. The earlier people begin 
to build their savings, the more money they will have when they reach 
retirement age. Among the plans that Fidelity administers, more than 
half of company employees now participate in the plan—triple the 
number of employees who participated in 2006. When these people 
need help with other financial matters, Fidelity will be ready.13
Questions
1.	 Why would Fidelity offer 524 mutual funds? What are the 
advantages to the company and to investors?
2.	 What are the pros and cons of having a checking account 
with Fidelity rather than with a local bank or credit union?
3.	 If you were trying to evaluate a specific mutual fund, where 
would you obtain the research information needed to choose 
the right fund? Assuming that you have found the right fund, 
would you prefer to invest online or talk with a Fidelity broker 
to complete the transaction?

Chapter 20   Understanding Personal Finances and Investments

1 	SOCIAL MEDIA EXERCISE
A growing number of personal finance- and investment-related 
ventures are starting to take advantage of the power of social 
media by connecting people beyond the boundaries of Facebook 
and Twitter. Peer-to-peer collaboration is now part of a new real-
ity in the personal finance and investment fields. Online investor 
communities like Investorvillage (http://investorvillage.com), 
Covestor (http://covestor.com), and SocialPicks (http://social-
picks.com) allow people to compare their investment ideas and 
their investment portfolio’s performance to those of peers, profes-
sional analysts, and financial bloggers. According to SocialPicks, 
the site is “a trusted online investing community where investors 
and traders invest smarter together.”
1.	 Do you think peer-to-peer investment and personal finance 
Web sites like these are valuable? Why or why not?
2.	 Do you trust peer-to-peer collaboration when it comes to 
investing and personal finance? Why or why not?
2 	JOURNALING FOR SUCCESS
According to many financial experts, the logical place to begin 
the search for a quality investment is to examine the products and 
services you use on a regular basis—products and services that 
provide a high level of consumer satisfaction.
The preceding statement is based on the assumption that if 
you like the product or service and you feel that you got excel-
lent value for your money, other consumers will too. And while 
it may be obvious, a satisfied, growing customer base can mean 
increased sales, profits, and ultimately higher stock values for  
the company that manufactured the product or provided the 
­service.
Assignment
1.	 To begin this journal exercise, think about purchases you 
made over the last month. Describe one product or service 
that you feel “was worth the money.”
2.	 For the product or service you chose, describe the attributes 
or features that impressed you.
3.	 Determine if the company that made the product or provided 
the service is a public company that has issued stock.* Then 
use the Internet or go to the library to research the investment 
potential for this company. Finally, describe why you feel this 
would be a good or bad investment at this time.
*If the company that manufactured the product or service 
you chose is not a public company, choose another product or 
service.
3 	DEVELOPING CRITICAL-THINKING SKILLS
One way to achieve financial security is to invest a stated amount 
of money on a systematic basis. This investment strategy is called 
dollar-cost averaging. When the cost is lower, your investment buys 
more shares. When the cost is higher, your investment buys 
fewer shares. A good way to begin investing is to select a mutual 
fund that meets your financial objectives and to invest the same 
amount each month or each year.
Assignment
1.	 Select several mutual funds from the financial pages of the 
Wall Street Journal or a personal finance periodical such as 
Money, Kiplinger’s Personal Finance, or SmartMoney that provides 
information about mutual funds. Call the toll-free number for 
each fund and ask about its objectives. Furthermore, request 
that the company send you a prospectus and an annual 
report.
2.	 Select one fund that meets your financial objectives.
3.	 Prepare a table that includes the following data:
a.	 An initial investment of $2,000 in the mutual fund you 
have selected
b.	 The net asset value (NAV)
c.	 The number of shares purchased
4.	 Record the investment information on a weekly basis. Look 
in the Wall Street Journal or on the Internet to find the NAV for 
each week.
5.	 Determine the value of your investment until the end of the 
semester.
6.	 Write a report describing the results. Include a summary of 
what you learned about investments. Be sure to indicate if you 
think that dollar-cost averaging (investing another $2,000 next 
year) would be a good idea.
4 	BUILDING TEAM SKILLS
Investing in stocks can be a way to beat inflation and accumulate 
money. Traditionally, stocks have earned just below 10 percent 
per year since 1926. Bonds and certificates of deposit, on the 
other hand, often earn little more than the inflation rate, making 
it very difficult to accumulate enough money for retirement.
Assignment
1.	 Form teams of three people. The teams will compete against 
each other, striving for the largest gain in investments.
2.	 Assume that you are buying stock in three companies; some 
should be listed on the NYSE, and some should be traded in 
the Nasdaq over-the-counter market.
a.	 Research different investments, and narrow your choices 
to three different stocks.
b.	 Divide your total investment of $25,000 into three 
amounts.
c.	 Determine the number of shares of stock you can pur-
chase in each company by dividing the budgeted amount 
by the price of the stock. Allow enough money to pay for 
the commission. To find the cost of the stock, multiply the 
number of shares you are going to purchase by the closing 
price of the stock.

Part 7   Finance and Investment
d.	 Assume that the commission is 1 percent. Calculate it by 
multiplying the cost of the stock by 0.01. Add the dollar 
amount of commission to the cost of the stock to deter-
mine the total purchase price.
3.	 Set up a table to reflect the following information:
a.	 Name of the company
b.	 Closing price per share
c.	 Number of shares purchased
d.	 Amount of the commission
e.	 Cost of the stock
4.	 Record the closing price of the stock on a weekly basis. 
Prepare a chart to use for this step.
5.	 Before the end of the semester, assume that you sell the stock.
a.	 Take the closing price on the day you sell your stocks and 
multiply it by the number of shares; then calculate the 
commission at 1 percent.
b.	 Deduct the amount of commission from the selling price 
of the stock. This is the total return on your investment.
6.	 Calculate your profit or loss. Subtract the total purchase price 
of the stock from the total return. If the total return is less 
than the total purchase price, you have a loss.
7.	 Prepare a report summarizing the results of the project. 
Include the table and individual stock charts, as well as a 
statement describing what you learned about investing in 
stocks.
5 	RESEARCHING DIFFERENT CAREERS
Today many people choose a personal financial advisor to help 
develop an investment program that will help them achieve their 
financial goals. Not only is this career choice an opportunity to 
help others, it is also one of the fastest growing career fields in 
the United States. According to the Occupational Outlook Handbook, 
the job opportunities for personal financial advisors are expected 
to increase by 32 percent between now and the year 2020. 
For help completing this exercise, use the Occupational Outlook 
Handbook in your college’s library or career center or go to www
.bls.gov/ooh.
Assignment
1.	 Answer the following questions based on information 
obtained in the Occupational Outlook Handbook.
a.	 What is the nature of the work performed by personal 
financial advisors?
b.	 What type of training or qualifications is required for a 
career in financial planning?
c.	 Where are the job opportunities for personal financial 
advisors?
d.	 What are typical annual wages for a personal financial 
advisor?
2.	 Summarize your findings in a report. Be sure to include if you 
would choose this career and why.
Almost as soon as Richard, Chip, and Robert Graeter became 
fourth-generation owners of the business their family had built, 
they started talking about expansion. They worked with Kroger, 
now their largest distribution partner, to put pints of Graeter’s ice 
cream on store shelves many miles from the company’s Cincinnati 
headquarters. Year by year, they increased their distribution reach 
with new retail partners—which meant they would need suffi-
cient production capacity to fill all their orders, especially during 
months of peak demand. 
Graeter’s Reading Road factory, opened in 1934, was a 
­printing plant before its conversion to ice-cream production. 
But it was bursting at the seams, and despite dramatic improve-
ments in production efficiency, the Graeters recognized the 
increasingly urgent need to construct a new facility to support 
ongoing expansion. 
FROM ONE FACTORY TO TWO
The economic situation was less than ideal for obtaining financ-
ing for a new factory, because the country—and the world—was 
in the grip of a severe and prolonged financial crisis. After scout-
ing possible locations and exploring various options, Graeter’s 
signed a 20-year deal with the city of Cincinnati. It paid the city a 
token amount for land in the Bond Hill neighborhood and bor-
rowed $10 million from the city to pay for construction of a new 
28,000-square-foot factory. The loan carried low interest rates 
and would be repaid over 20 years. In turn, Cincinnati issued $10 
million in bonds to provide Graeter’s with this funding. 
Graeter’s received a total package of financial incentives 
worth $3.3 million toward its new Bond Hill factory. In exchange, 
Graeter’s committed to “stay and grow” in Cincinnati for at least 
20 years, creating new jobs when the facility opened and even 
more as Graeter’s growth continued.
Following months of construction, the new facility officially 
opened in 2010, during Graeter’s landmark 140th anniversary 
year. “As a Cincinnati-based, family-run company, we are proud 
of our association with this wonderful city and look forward to 
new generations of success,” said Richard Graeter II, Graeter’s 
CEO. “We are incredibly grateful [for the City’s assistance], 
because not only will their support help us expand nationally, but 
it is also helping us create jobs locally.”

FROM TWO FACTORIES TO THREE
Even as the Bond Hill facility was nearing opening day, Graeter’s 
was presented with an unexpected opportunity. Its largest franchi-
see wanted to sell the franchise operation, complete with stores 
and an ice-cream factory, and Graeter’s had the right to buy 
the franchise back. The timing was almost perfect for its growth 
strategy, giving Graeter’s not one, not two, but three production 
facilities to fuel expansion. On the other hand, how would the 
company pay for this unanticipated acquisition? 
“That was not planned, not part of our strategic vision,” 
explains Richard Graeter, “but the opportunity came up, and we 
had to look at it.” If the Graeters decided to move ahead with the 
acquisition, “we had to come up with several millions of dollars 
in additional financing over and above what we had borrowed to 
build our new plant. So that means working with the bankers and 
lawyers and accountants to model how the business would look 
after the acquisition to determine if it makes financial sense, and 
then going out and raising the investment that you need to make 
the acquisition.” 
In the end, after looking at what the business had done in 
the past and where it was going in the future, the three great-
grandsons of Graeter’s founders decided that this unexpected 
acquisition would be a good move. They put together the financ-
ing needed to buy the stores and factory from the franchisee. 
Now Graeter’s has the added strength of a sizable retail chain as 
well as three factories equipped to make the company’s signature 
French-pot ice cream, one small batch after another—the right 
combination of ingredients for expanding from coast to coast and 
beyond.14
Questions
1.	 What kinds of questions do you think Cincinnati officials 
asked Graeter’s owners before agreeing to loan the company 
$10 million? Why would Graeter’s go with this financing 
arrangement rather than borrowing from a bank to pay for 
the Bond Hill factory?
2.	 One of the financing strategies Graeter’s has not used is to 
sell common stock to the general public. Why would Graeter’s 
hesitate to go public? Do you agree with its decision to use 
debt rather than equity financing?
3.	 As an investor, would you be willing to buy shares in Graeter’s 
if it decided to go public through an IPO? Explain why the 
company’s stock would or would not be a good investment 
for you.
In this last section, provide some information about your exit 
strategy, and discuss any potential trends, problems, or risks that 
you may encounter. These risks and assumptions could relate 
to your industry, markets, company, or personnel. Make sure to 
incorporate important information not included in other parts of 
the business plan in an appendix. Now is also the time to go back 
and prepare the executive summary, which should be placed at 
the beginning of the business plan.
THE EXIT STRATEGY COMPONENT
Your exit strategy component should at least include answers to 
the following questions:
7.1	 How do you intend to get yourself (and your money) out of 
the business?
7.2	 Will your children take over the business, or do you intend to 
sell it later?
7.3	 Do you intend to grow the business to the point of an IPO?
7.4	 How will investors get their money back?
THE CRITICAL RISKS AND 
ASSUMPTIONS COMPONENT
Your critical risks and assumptions component should answer at 
least the following questions:
7.5	 What will you do if your market does not develop as quickly 
as you predicted? What if your market develops too quickly?
7.6	 What will you do if your competitors underprice or make 
your product obsolete?
7.7	 What will you do if there is an unfavorable industry-wide 
trend?
7.8	 What will happen if trained workers are not available as pre-
dicted?
7.9	 What will you do if there is an erratic supply of products or 
raw materials?
THE APPENDIX COMPONENT
Supplemental information and documents are often included in 
an appendix. Here are a few examples of some documents that 
can be included:
●
●
Résumés of owners and principal managers
●
●
Advertising samples and brochures
●
●
An organization chart
●
●
Floor plans of a retail facility or factory
REVIEW OF BUSINESS PLAN ACTIVITIES
As you have discovered, writing a business plan involves a long 
series of interrelated steps. As with any project involving a number 
of complex steps and calculations, your business plan should be 
reviewed carefully and revised before you present it to potential 
investors or lenders.
Remember, there is one more component you need to prepare 
after your business plan is completed: The executive summary 
should be written last, but because of its importance, it appears 
after the introduction.

Part 7   Finance and Investment
THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY COMPONENT
In the executive summary, give a one- to two-page overview of 
your entire business plan. This is the most important part of the 
business plan and is of special interest to busy bankers, investors, 
and other interested parties. Remember, this section is a sum-
mary; more detailed information is provided in the remainder of 
your business plan.
Make sure that the executive summary captures the reader’s 
attention instantly in the first sentence by using a key selling point 
or benefit of the business.
Your executive summary should include answers to at least the 
following:
7.10	 Company information. What product or service do you 
provide? What is your competitive advantage? When will 
 the company be formed? What are your company objec-
tives? What is the background of you and your management 
team?
7.11	 Market opportunity. What is the expected size and growth 
rate of your market, your expected market share, and any 
relevant market trends?
Once again, review your answers to all the questions in the 
preceding parts to make sure that they are all consistent through-
out the entire business plan.
Although many would-be entrepreneurs are excited about the 
prospects of opening their own business, remember that it takes a 
lot of hard work, time, and in most cases a substantial amount of 
money. Though the business plan provides an enormous amount 
of information about your business, it is only the first step. Once 
it is completed, it is now your responsibility to implement the 
plan. Good luck in your business venture.
