Introduction
What is identity 
theft and how 
does it work?

8
Identity Theft
Identity theft has been around in one 
form or another for many years but 
today’s technology is providing new 
ways for people to steal our personal 
information. Identity theft is one of 
the fastest growing crimes in the 
UK and a recent Home Offi  ce quote 
put the overall cost of identity fraud 
to the UK economy at a staggering 
£1.72 billion. The Credit Industry Fraud 
Avoidance System (CIFAS), the UK’s 
fraud prevention service, estimates 
that identity fraud accounts for criminal 
cash fl ow of £10 million per day. 

Introduction
9
Estimates from The Association for 
Payment Clearing Services (APACS), 
the body that deals with fraud 
relating to bank and credit cards, 
reveal that all credit card crime has 
grown from £95 million in 1998 to 
£504 million in 2005. It is estimated 
that benefit fraud costs UK tax 
payers £3 billion a year, and identity 
fraud is a significant portion of this. 
Estimates from CIFAS suggest that 
in 2006 the number of victims of 
impersonation was up 19.1 per cent 
when compared with 2005. 

10
Identity Theft
These figures suggest that the 
criminals are one step ahead of the 
agencies and companies whose job 
it is to protect our data. Initiatives 
are being introduced rapidly to 
combat this new kind of crime but 
it’s clear this is a problem that is not 
going away. 
If your details are stolen and 
purchases are made in your name you 
are not liable for the debts incurred. 
However, apart from the headache 
which accompanies having to prove 
to the creditor the fact that it was not 

Introduction
11
you who ran up these debts, lending 
institutions don’t take these hits on 
the chin and chalk them up to the 
cost of doing business – they recoup 
their loses by increasing insurance 
premiums and interest rates, and 
raising service charges and the general 
cost of their products. Knowing how 
to protect yourself is vital to avoid the 
distress and inconvenience that comes 
with being the victim of identity theft.


13
Part One
What makes up 
our identity?

Identity Theft
14
There are three basic elements to our 
identities: 
Biometric identity
These are the physical attributes 
that are unique to an individual, 
i.e. fi ngerprints, voice, retina, facial 
structure, DNA profi le, hand geometry, 
heat radiation, etc. Despite how much 
is made of the supposed infallibility of 
biometric identifying technology, the 
truth is that it is far from foolproof. 
In any case, at present this kind of 
technology is not in widespread use 
as a means of determining identity; it 

Part One
15
is really only of interest to governments 
and private industries concerned with 
protecting their research or worried 
about industrial espionage, as the 
equipment required is very expensive. 
Attributed identity
This includes the components of a 
person’s identity that are acquired at 
birth, including their full name, date 
and place of birth, and parents’ names. 
Persons carrying out this kind of identity 
theft tend to be interested in the birth 
records of children who died in infancy. 

Identity Theft
16
Such situations are sometimes referred 
to as ‘Day of the Jackal’ identity theft, 
after Fredrick Forsyth’s novel. However, 
determined thieves may not only 
target the records of children who die 
in infancy – there is nothing to stop a 
would-be identity thief from getting 
hold of your birth certifi cate as such 
documents are readily available from 
the Family Record Centre for a small fee. 
It is a public document so it requires 
no identifi cation and the registrar 
cannot refuse a copy. These are known 
within the counter-fraud community as 

Part One
17
‘breeder’ documents. Armed with such 
a document the thief can build on this 
foundation and apply for further forms 
of identifi cation, as many institutions 
will use it to process an application – 
despite the fact that UK birth certifi cates 
contain the words ‘a certifi cate is not 
evidence of identity’. Again, although 
popular in fi ction and of great concern 
to the government since career criminals 
and terrorists might hijack identities and 
go untraced, this kind of identity theft is 
comparatively rare when seen alongside 
biographical identity theft.

Identity Theft
18
Biographical identity
This type includes elements of 
identity which have built up over 
time. Identity theft of this kind is the 
most prevalent and causes the most 
diffi  culty and disruption to the victim. 
It will also be the focus of the bulk 
of this book. Biographical identity 
covers life events and how a person 
engages with structured society, i.e:
 
 
registration of birth; 
 
details of education/
qualiﬁ cations; 

Part One
19
 
electoral register 
entries; 
 
details of beneﬁ ts claimed/
taxes paid; 
 
employment history; 
 
registration of marriage; 
 
mortgage account 
information/property 
ownership; 
 
insurance policies; 

Identity Theft
20
 
history of interaction 
with organisations such as 
banks, creditors, utilities 
and public authorities. 
Following legislation to combat money 
laundering in the UK, banks are now 
required to verify the name and address 
of new customers before opening an 
account. They achieve this by requiring 
the prospective customer to present 
two of the aforementioned documents 
as proof of identity and domicile. This 
leads to what the credit industry calls 
‘function creep’: the function of certain 

Part One
21
documents ‘creeps’ into other areas. 
For instance, the function of utility 
bills is merely to tell you how much 
to pay your service provider, they are 
not identifi cation documents, but in 
certain situations they are treated as 
bona fi de credentials.
What do identity thieves 
do with the information?
Understanding how these criminals 
operate will help you to identify when 
you are most at risk and need to take 
extra precautions. 

Identity Theft
22
Identity fraud spans the criminal 
spectrum: from the opportunist 
who steals your credit card number 
and buys an iPod with it, to the 
running of sophisticated networks 
of 
illegal 
immigration, 
money 
laundering and drugs smuggling. 
It also encompasses frauds against 
the public sector by way of benefit 
fraud and individuals using false 
identities to avoid paying fines 
to the authorities. All of these 
criminals 
have 
something 
in 
common: they are attempting to 

Part One
23
hide their identity, their activities 
and their assets.
As stated earlier, biographical 
identity is by far the easiest to 
hijack. It is generally done by 
getting 
genuine 
government 
documents issued on the basis of 
false information (i.e. an identity 
thief may apply for a genuine 
driving licence using documents he 
has stolen from you) or by stealing 
genuine documents and forging 
the details contained on them.

Identity Theft
24
Once an identity thief manages 
to acquire your information there 
are many ways by which he can 
carry out fraudulent activity. With 
just one piece of your identity 
he can obtain further identity 
documents which enable him to, 
for example:
 
apply for a mobile phone 
contract in your name;
 
apply for a credit card 
in your name;

Part One
25
 
open a bank or building 
society account in your 
name;
 
apply for other ﬁ nancial 
services in your name;
 
apply for any beneﬁ ts in 
your name (e.g. housing 
beneﬁ t, new tax credits, 
income 
support, 
job 
seeker’s allowance, child 
beneﬁ t);
 
apply for a driving licence 
in your name;

Identity Theft
26
 
register a vehicle in your 
name; or
 
apply for a passport in your 
name.
Obviously, once these items are in 
the thief’s possession, he or she can 
run up huge debts using a credit or 
debit card in your name to make 
expensive purchases, or obtaining 
a loan with your details.
It may be hard to imagine a thief 
could wreak so much havoc with 
such little information as a starting 

Part One
27
point but, worryingly, this is not as 
impossible as you might think. For 
example, the UK Driver and Vehicle 
Licensing Agency (DVLA) will accept 
UK/EU/EEA 
passports 
(including 
travel documents issued by the Home 
Offi  ce) and EU/EEA national identity 
cards as means of identifi cation for the 
purposes of obtaining a driving licence. 
Birth certifi cates (including adoption 
certifi cates) and foreign passports can 
be used but they must be accompanied 
by a photograph endorsed by a 
countersignatory – a non-relative who 

Identity Theft
28
lives in the UK and has known the 
applicant for over two years. UK birth 
certificates state that ‘a certifi cate 
is not evidence of identity’ and the 
DVLA say that they may require further 
evidence. The reality, however, is that 
the DVLA only check a proportion of 
the countersignatories as the driving 
licence system is required by law to 
be self-fi nancing. The DVLA is under 
pressure to keep cost increases to a 
minimum. 
With a false driving licence in your 
name a car could be obtained on hire-

Part One
29
purchase, as the signature on the card 
would match the one on the purchase 
agreement, and with an approved 
credit check the criminal could drive 
off  in the car and, in an extreme 
scenario, sell it to you the next day. 
Thankfully, you will not be liable for 
the criminal off ence of handling stolen 
goods, as you accepted them in good 
faith; however, this won’t save you 
from the car being repossessed by 
the fi nance company. 
The good news is that most 
identity theft can be prevented 

Identity Theft
30
with a little care in your daily 
routine. The following section will 
explain when you are most at risk 
and outline simple steps to prevent 
becoming a victim.

31
Part Two
How can I
protect myself?

Identity Theft
32
Identity theft is subject to the old adage 
‘an ounce of prevention is worth a 
pound of cure’. A minor change in how 
you manage your personal information 
could save you many sleepless nights 
and distressing phone calls and letters. 
Minimising your exposure to potential 
identity thieves does not have to 
involve fi tting an impenetrable safe in 
the wall behind the family portrait, nor 
wiping your fi ngerprints off  glassware 
in restaurants; it does, however, require 
certain extra steps to be introduced into 
your day-to-day life. 

Part Two
33
There are times in life when we are 
more vulnerable to identity thieves 
than others – it is on these occasions 
that a little extra vigilance will go a 
long way.
Theft of credit/debit 
cards
Situations under this heading comprise 
the most common types of identity 
fraud. Someone might steal your wallet, 
or even just one card from your wallet 
so you won’t immediately know it is 
missing, and then use it posing as you. The 

Identity Theft
34
chip and pin technology which is now in 
eff ect across the UK has had a signifi cant 
impact on this type of fraud; however, if 
the fraudster already has your card they 
don’t need your PIN to purchase goods 
online or over the phone as they are also 
in possession of your security code (the 
three digit number on the back of the 
card by the signature strip) for so-called 
‘card not present’ transactions.
If you haven’t noticed that your card 
is missing, the criminal is unlikely to be 
caught until the card reaches its limit 
and is declined. Even after the limit has 

Part Two
35
been exceeded, the card can still be 
used for some time for smaller amounts 
which are beneath the ‘fl oor limit’ of 
shops, whereby no automatic check is 
made with the card company for the 
transaction. Then comes the phone 
call to you from the credit company.
To minimise the risk of this all too 
common occurrence, here are some 
simple safeguards:
 
If you have cards you don’t 
carry, keep them in a secure 
place and periodically check 
that they remain there

Identity Theft
36
 
Cancel cards that you 
no longer use: if the 
account is still active 
there is available credit 
to be stolen
 
Keep your cheque book and 
cheque guarantee card in 
separate places
 
If you have a high credit 
limit that you never use, 
consider requesting to 
have it reduced
 
Examine your signature 
– if it is very easy to 

Part Two
37
forge you may want to 
consider changing it
 
Don’t choose an obvious 
PIN or store it somewhere 
it can be accessed by 
others
 
Never let anyone see your 
PIN

Identity Theft
38
All these tips apply both to 
credit and debit cards, but 
debit cards put you at greater 
risk as they often have your 
account number and sort 
code printed on the face of the 
card.
There is also the danger of your card 
details being stolen when you use your 
card in the normal way. This is called 

Part Two
39
‘skimming’. It occurs where an employee 
processes your transaction but makes 
a copy of your details which they might 
use themselves for making purchases 
or sell on to a third party involved in 
fraud on a larger scale. That information 
can then be used in ‘card not present’ 
transactions, or might also be used to 
construct a fake credit card using your 
details. 
Your funds can also be at risk even 
without your card ever passing into 
someone else’s hands. Sophisticated 
thieves install equipment on the 

Identity Theft
40
front of the card slot on an ATM 
which captures your credit/debit 
card number as you put it into 
the machine. Hidden above the 
machine is a miniature digital 
camera which captures the key 
strokes of you entering your PIN. All 
this information is then wirelessly 
transmitted to the thief’s computer 
nearby. A card can now be created 
using all your data, thus enabling 
them to access your account. 
More crude, but also very effective, 
is the use of the so-called ‘Lebanese 

Part Two
41
loop’. These are little slivers of film 
which are placed in the card slot, 
which trap your card when you 
insert it. Once it is stuck, a stranger 
approaches asking if you need help 
and more than likely telling you that 
their card got stuck the other day. 
They will probably suggest a series 
of steps for you to take, which will 
inevitably include you entering 
your PIN. Nothing you do will get 
the card back and once you leave in 
frustration, hoping to return during 
business hours to get your card from 

Identity Theft
42
the bank, they pull out the Lebanese 
loop with your card in it and, having 
witnessed you entering your PIN, 
they now have all they need to 
access your account.
Credit card companies regularly 
monitor card usage and are likely 
to spot something that is out of 
the ordinary, the simplest example 
being recent transactions that are 
physically impossible: you purchase 
goods at your local supermarket and 
within minutes your account is being 
used to make a purchase in the USA 

Part Two
43
– this could be a case of ‘skimming’ 
and your card issuer should contact 
you to check. You won’t be liable 
for the fraudulent purchase, but it 
will necessitate cancelling the card 
– this could be a real problem if you 
were travelling and unable to have a 
replacement card sent to you.
There are a few precautions which can 
reduce the risk of this type of scam:
 
Be wary of how your 
credit card is being 
processed (suspicious 

Identity Theft
44
delays, 
processing 
the 
card in another room). 
If you have a concern it 
is probably best not to 
challenge the vendor but 
instead contact your card 
issuer with your concerns 
right away.
 
Regularly check your 
credit card/bank 
statements for anything 
suspicious – report any 
concerns to your card 
issuer immediately.
 
If you must have multiple 
cards, consider designating 

Part Two
45
different cards for 
different types of 
purchases. This will 
help you identify any 
suspicious transactions.
 
Notify your card issuer if 
you are travelling abroad 
– some specify that you 
must do this, but even if 
they don’t, it’s a wise 
move.

your credit/debit cards safely see the 
Card Watch website at http://www.
cardwatch.org.uk.  

Identity Theft
46
Moving house
Relocating is stressful and difficult 
at the best of times; there is no 
reason to add to your worries by 
making yourself an easy target for 
identity thieves. It is important that 
you inform all credit companies with 
whom you have a relationship of 
your change of address to minimise 
the risk of any sensitive information 
falling into the wrong hands. The 
Royal Mail offers a free service by 
which they take care of informing all 
your creditors and service providers 

Part Two
47
of your change of address and 
over 1,000 companies participate 
in the scheme. If you would prefer 
to contact the companies directly, 
Royal Mail also offers a mail redirect 
service which will catch any that you 
forgot to inform of your new address 
and sent mail to your old one. Many 
people use this service for a short 
time to cover the transition period. 
See http://www.royalmail.com and 
follow the link for Customer Service. 
This service is definitely a good idea 
but it is not foolproof.

Identity Theft
48
Your 
bank 
and 
credit 
card 
companies may know of your 
change of address, but offers of 
pre-approved credit cards or loans 
from companies unaware that you 
no longer live there may go out to 
your old address long after you have 
moved. An identity thief may accept 
such offers and incur debt in your 
name, or use the official documents 
received 
to 
authenticate 
other 
applications for credit.
To minimise your exposure to this 
type of fraud you should regularly 

Part Two
49
check your credit fi le (see p. 96) as 
this will show all accounts still 
active at your previous address. 
You may also want to consider 
using the redirection service for up 
to a year and ensure that when you 
receive a piece of redirected mail, 
you contact the sender with your 
new address. 
Extra vigilance should also be 
exercised if you live in somewhere 
which 
uses 
pigeon 
holes 
for 
holding your post – where others 
can have unfettered access to your 

Identity Theft
50
correspondence it is imperative 
that you stay on top of things. If 
correspondence goes missing or 
you suspect it has been tampered 
with, get a copy of your credit 
report to see if there has been any 
unusual activity.
Travel
Travel poses its own risks to the 
security of our information. For 
instance, a discarded boarding-
pass stub is a potential gold 
mine of personal information. If 

Part Two
51
the boarding pass belonged to a 
frequent flyer club member it is 
likely that data can be gleaned 
from it. For instance, if the ticket 
was purchased with the relevant 
airline in the person’s name using 
the frequent flyer number on the 
boarding pass, personal data such 
as passport number, nationality 
and date of birth would then 
be accessible. Armed with this 
information the savvy identity thief 
could then access public websites 
to find the person’s address, which 

Identity Theft
52
can then be used to source further 
documents. Care should always be 
taken when disposing of this kind 
of material: take it home with you 
and shred it before throwing it out. 
Unfortunately, some disclosure of 
information is inevitable when you 
are travelling. Checking into a hotel 
provides a great deal of information 
about you: your address, telephone 
number, length of your absence 
from home, together with the 
credit card details which are often 
taken when checking in. Consider 

Part Two
53
using your work address if such 
information is required when you 
register. It is also recommended 
that you use the room safe, if 
provided, or a safe provided by 
the registration desk, to keep 
your passport and other valuables 
safe during your stay. Granted 
this will not protect you from an 
unscrupulous hotel employee but it 
will save you headache should your 
room be burgled – your suitcase is 
not a secure place for these items. 
Similarly, if you are abroad and using 

Identity Theft
54
a rental car you should be sure not to 
leave any valuables in the car when 
it is parked, especially identification 
and financial information.
As well as providing information 
on issues of concern in specifi c 
destinations, 
the 
Foreign 
and 
Commonwealth 
Offi  ce 
provides 
travel advice and tips for keeping your 
documents and money safe whilst 
travelling. See the ‘know before you 
go’ section at: http://www.fco.gov.uk/
knowbeforeyougo.

Part Two
55
Telephone calls
Identity thieves are a canny bunch 
and you may fall victim to their con by 
unknowingly giving your information 
away. People often ask for valuable 
information on the phone and they are 
not necessarily identity thieves – private 
investigators, sales people, pollsters 
and even police offi  cers are all guilty of 
it. The identity thief goes a step further 
by taking that information and using 
it for wholly illegal purposes. It goes 
without saying that you should never 
give out sensitive information over the 

Identity Theft
56
phone unless you are sure of whom you 
are talking to. But the fact remains that 
these are shrewd operators who use a 
number of very deceptive techniques 
to get what they want.
Seldom will an identity thief ask you 
for your banking details directly. More 
often than not they already have most 
pieces in the puzzle and are seeking the 
last one to give them access to credit 
in your name. The caller may already 
have your account number, sort code, 
address and date of birth and be able 
to cite them to you. Under the guise of 

Part Two
57
a bank employee claiming a problem 
with your debit card, for instance, you 
are asked for the security code. Why 
would you suspect anything when the 
caller is already in possession of all that 
other information?
The rule of thumb here is to limit the 
amount of information you give out 
over the phone. All reputable creditors 
will go through a security check with 
you before asking for any sensitive 
information, which should go beyond 
just checking your address. You will 
generally be asked to give a specifi c 

Identity Theft
58
digit in your password or PIN – NOT 
the whole thing – or a specifi c letter in 
your mother’s maiden name – NOT the 
whole name. When in doubt, do not 
divulge any information and simply 
tell the caller that you will call back on 
the offi  cial number to go through the 
details. 
A particularly audacious take on this 
con is when someone calls pretending 
to be from the bank and off ers to sell 
you identity theft insurance. They will 
most likely already have the number 
of the credit/debit card that they are 

Part Two
59
pretending to insure and only need the 
security code to give them unfettered 
access to your money. Once again, 
tell the caller that you will call back on 
the offi  cial number to go through the 
details. Your security code should only 
be divulged if you have made the call 
and you are absolutely certain of whom 
you are talking to. 
You should be similarly wary of street 
canvassers – you may be stopped in the 
street by bogus canvassers and asked 
to take part in a ‘survey’ which involves 
divulging your personal details. Do 

Identity Theft
60
not respond to their request for your 
details unless you are certain that 
they are legitimate, and even then be 
wary of giving more than one piece of 
information. For instance, don’t give 
your address and your date of birth 
– most surveys will ask for you to give 
them an age range (i.e. are you between 
the ages of 18–25?) rather than an 
actual date of birth. 
Bin bag theft
Debt collectors and private investigators 
have for a long time stolen bin bags 

Part Two
61
that have been left out for collection in 
an eff ort to identify assets that can be 
seized by creditors. For identity thieves 
in the UK, this method of information 
collection is still in its infancy, but it is 
growing. 
It is known as bin raiding in the 
UK and dumpster diving in the US. 
Typically these people are looking for 
documents or information that will 
enable them to piece together an 
identity: phone bills, utility bills, bank 
statements, credit/debit card receipts, 
employment and tax records. 

Identity Theft
62
Using 
stolen 
documents 
to obtain credit is certainly 
illegal, but stealing bin bags 
might not be deemed as theft 
if the thief could establish 
that he believed that it was 
abandoned property – even 
if the bag is in your rubbish 
bin he will have a defence 
to a charge of theft if he can 
show that he believed you 
had dumped the bag never 
intending to take it back.

Part Two
63
The importance of shredding such 
documents cannot be overstated. 
Even seemingly safe information 
can be dangerous when taken in 
combination with other details. For 
instance, most credit/debit card 
receipts carry a line to show the 
card that made the purchase, but all 
numbers except for four are marked 
by an ‘X’. The trouble is that not every 
system shows only the last four 
digits so it may in fact be possible to 
piece together your 16 digit number 
from various receipts.

Identity Theft
64
 
Shred all documents 
containing personal 
information before 
placing them in the bin/
recycling box.
 
Consider disposing of some 
of the shredded paper at 
home and some at work.
Unfortunately, it is not only the 
rubbish from your home which is at 
risk of being raided – our employers 
possess all manner of sensitive 
information about us and it is vital 
that they take the responsibilities 

Part Two
65
in respect of that data seriously. 
Companies which hold personal 
data have a duty of care under Data 
protection legislation to protect 
that information. You may wish to 
ask your employer what systems 
they have in place for disposing 
of confidential information such 
as payroll data, National Insurance 
numbers and tax information. 
Sophisticated 
identity 
thieves 
no longer simply target the paper 
contents of your rubbish bin. 
The hard drive of any discarded 

Identity Theft
66
computer is a potential source of 
information for the technically 
proficient identity thief. Deleting 
fi les on your hard disc is not suffi  cient 
to protect yourself – tools exist to 
recover files on a hard drive that has 
not been properly formatted. These 
programs are designed to assist us 
when disaster strikes our computer 
and we lose all our data. However, 
they can easily be turned against 
us. There are many programs that 
can help format your hard disc 
to reduce the chances of anyone 

Part Two
67
lifting any data off it – consider the

it is a secure method but 
it will cost you.
 
Use one of the programs

Deceased identity theft
CIFAS reports that impersonation of 
the dead is the fastest growing form 
of identity theft in Britain with a 
year on year increase of 60 per cent. 
Suffering the loss of someone close 
to you is difficult enough without 
having to deal with irate creditors 
looking for money from your 
departed dear one. Following these 

Identity Theft
70
simple steps should make a diffi  cult 
time a little easier:
 
Don’t include the date of 
birth or address of the 
deceased in any advertisement 
announcing the funeral
 
Notify government 
departments (Department 
for Work and Pensions, 
HM Revenue) and return 
any pension or allowance 
books by registered post
 
Notify any of the deceased’s 
creditors of the death

Part Two
71
 
When sorting through clothing 
to be donated be sure there 
are no documents containing 
sensitive information
 
Don’t dispose of any 
documents containing 
sensitive information 
without shredding them 
ﬁ rst
 
Contact the Royal Mail to 
ensure that no one has 
set up a mail redirection 
service that you don’t know 
about – this is especially 
important if the deceased’s 
property is now empty

Identity Theft
72
 
Have a mail redirection 
service set up to forward 
post to your address – this 
is safer than collecting 
the post yourself
If creditors do contact you regarding 
debts in the deceased’s name which 
were not theirs, explain the situation 
and also report the matter to the police 
and get a crime reference number. 
You should also contact CIFAS and get 
a protective registration against the 
deceased person’s address – this can 
be done by a relative or executor of the 

Part Two
73
deceased’s estate – which will red-fl ag 
that address in case a credit application 
is made using it. For further information 
see http://www.cifas.org.uk. You can also 
register with the Deceased Preference 
Service, a free service which will remove 
the details of the deceased from the 
mailing list of many companies. For 
further information see http://www.
deceasedpreferenceservice.co.uk.
Internet
The Internet has changed the way we 
communicate and opened up the world 

Identity Theft
74
to us at the click of a mouse. However, 
like most technology it is a double-
edged sword. It wasn’t long before 
identity thieves struck upon the idea of 
using it as a tool to hijack our precious 
data. Extra caution is needed when 
communicating sensitive information 
over the net and an awareness of certain 
scams that have been in operation 
should help protect you from falling 
victim to them yourself.
If you are making any purchases 
online or doing any online banking 
it is imperative that you have an 

Part Two
75
anti-virus programme and update 
it on a regular basis. It is also a 
good idea to install a firewall. These 
can be either software or hardware 
based (the home variety normally 
being software based) and operate 
to control and filter unwanted 
traffic going in and out of different 
zones, i.e. between your computer 
and the Internet. Once installed it 
runs constantly in the background 
so you don’t have to set it up 
again. A firewall will ask for your 
permission to allow an application 

Identity Theft
76
to access an outer network. You can 
deny this access if you don’t want to 
send particular information over the 
network – this becomes very useful 
if your computer has been infected 
with a Trojan virus that will connect 
to other hosts and show them your 
keystrokes, giving them sensitive 
passwords or, worse yet, allowing 
them to take control of your computer 
remotely. In addition to these steps 
it’s a good idea to download the 
latest security updates for your web 
browser and operating system.

Part Two
77
Many websites require you to register 
your details with them so that when 
you return to make future purchases 
you don’t have to re-enter you credit/
debit card details. Ensure that in these 
circumstances you don’t use an obvious 
password and be careful to logout 
properly when you have completed the 
transaction. When making purchases 
online it is important to ensure that you 
are giving your fi nancial details over a 
secure webpage. Secured websites use 
encryption programmes to scramble 
your information as it is transmitted 

Identity Theft
78
over the Internet. If the site is secure, 
the prefi x to the domain address will be 
https://www. This can be found in the 
address bar. 
Look also for a yellow closed 
padlock or an unbroken key icon at 
the bottom of your web browser. 

Part Two
79
If neither of these are present, 
consider discontinuing the transaction 
or enquire about alternative 
methods of ordering such as by 
telephone. It should also be noted 
that even if these secure indicators 
are present you should never use 
a public computer, such as one in 
an Internet café, to access sensitive 
financial information. For further 
information and advice on how to 
stay safe online see: http://www.
banksafeonline.org.uk.

Identity Theft
80
Phishing
A common technique utilised by the 
scammer is to send e-mails which when 
opened appear to be the website of 
your bank. They prompt you to enter 
your account number and password 
under the pretext that there is a problem 
with your account. The more advanced 
phishing pages will actually bring you 
to your bank’s homepage once you 
have clicked ‘login’ after entering your 
information. By that point it is too late 
and they have your details. You may 
think that you would never fall for such 

Part Two
81
a scam. Think again. In 2003 UK police 
estimated that phishing scams cost £60 
million in the UK alone.
If you receive an e-mail that 
tells you there is a problem 
with your bank account and 
you must enter your details, 
delete the e-mail and contact 
your bank using a telephone 
number or website which you 
know to be genuine.

Identity Theft
82
A notorious e-mail scam is the story 
of the wife of the late Nigerian head 
of state, General Sanni Abacha. The e-
mail states that she has received $45 
million dollars from a Russian contact 
which she needs to move out of the 
country and is willing to pay a 20 
per cent commission to anyone who 
kindly provides their banking details 
for the transfer to take place. Targets 
have included companies, charities, 
churches and individuals. It may be 
obvious to you that it is a scam but it 
wasn’t to the Brazilian bank manager 

Part Two
83
who was hoodwinked out of $242 
million. So widespread has this e-mail 
scam become that it has had a negative 
eff ect on foreign investment in 
Nigeria and they have passed criminal 
legislation specifi cally to combat it.
 
Suspicious unsolicited e-
mails of this kind should 
be deleted immediately.
 
Never give your personal 
ﬁ nancial details to anyone 
b y  e - m a i l .  R e p u t a b l e 
c o m p a n i e s  w o u l d  n o t 
request that you do this 

Identity Theft
84
as they understand that 
it is not a secure method 
of communication.

Wireless surﬁ ng
The advent of wireless technology has 
allowed us to untie ourselves from our 
phone cables and surf the Internet 
anywhere with a hotspot. Wireless 

Part Two
85
Internet access is also becoming very 
popular in the home, allowing people to 
roam from room to room or numerous 
users to share the same network. 
Although very convenient, it does 
present certain security concerns that 
we should be aware of. An unsecured 
network makes it easier for hackers to 
access your computer. The following 
are some simple steps which should be 
taken to secure your wireless access:
 
Every 
wireless 
router 
has a default username (a 
Service Set Identiﬁ er, or 

Identity Theft
86
SSID). Hackers interested in 
your personal information 
know what these are and with 
them can hack into your 
system. 
Your 
router’s 
set-up instructions will 
tell you how to change 
the SSID to a different 
name. 
 
Enable Wired Equivalent 
Privacy (WEP) on your 
computer. WEP is designed 
to provide a level of 
security similar to that 
of a wired network. It 
aims to provide security 
by encrypting data over 

Part Two
87
radio waves so that it 
is protected as it is 
transmitted from one end 
point to another. Windows 
XP is WEP enabled: you 
can set it to turn on 
automatically and it will 
prevent anyone snooping on 
your wireless broadband 
signal. 
For 
earlier 
versions 
of 
Windows, 
the WEP software should 
be included with your 
wireless network card/
router.
 

Identity Theft
88
 
When purchasing a wireless 
device, you might want 
to check that it is Wi-
Fi 
Protected 
Access 
(WPA) enabled. This is 
a more advanced form of 
encryption than WEP and 
if your device has it 
you can simply turn it 
on by ticking ‘Use WPA 
encryption instead of WEP’ 
in the Wireless Network 
Setup Wizard. 
These precautions should suffice 
for most homes; however, if you 
are handy with computers you 

Part Two
89
could also consider more advanced 
security measures which will reduce 
even further the possibility of being 
hacked. Every wireless device has a 
Media Access Code, or MAC; this is 
a serial number that can be found 
on the outer casing of the device. 
You can enter the MAC address on 
each computer on your network 
and that will ensure that only those 
computers can access your wireless 
network. Your computer also has a 
MAC code, which you will need to 
get so that you can finish setting 

Identity Theft
90
up the security measure. To find 
this, in Windows NT and later versions 
follow these steps:
 
Click 
Start, 
Run 
then 
type command in the box 
and click OK. A new window 
will appear with a black 
background. 
 
Type ipconﬁ g/all and press 
the Enter key. A list of 
information should appear 
in the window. Look for 
the line called Physical 
address 
– 
that’s 
your 
computer’s MAC address. 

Part Two
91
You will now need to input the MAC 
address to confi gure your router. Follow 
these steps:
 
Click 
on 
Start, 
then 
Control Panel and then 
Network Connections
 
In 
Network 
Connections 
right 
click 
on 
your 
wireless router icon and 
then click Properties
 
Under General tab, click 
on the Conﬁ gure button, 
then click on Advanced 
tab

Identity Theft
92
 
Under Property section, you 
will see Network Address 
or 
Locally 
Administered 
Address, click on it
 
On the right side, under 
Value, type in the New MAC 
address you want to assign 
to your router
 
Click Start, Run then type 
command in the box and click 
OK. A new window will appear 
with a black background 
 
Type ipconﬁ g/all or net 
conﬁ g rdr to verify the 
changes 

Part Two
93
 
Restart your computer
These steps initiate ‘MAC address filtering’ 
which means that your home wireless 
network will only work with devices that 
have the correct MAC codes. 
Due to its very nature, wireless 
networking is not as secure as using a hard 
line to access the Internet. Nevertheless, 
these steps will increase the security of 
your network immeasurably and allow 
you to take advantage of the freedom 
which a Wi-Fi connection aff ords. 


95
Part Three
How do I know if 
I am a victim of 
identity theft?

Identity Theft
96
The importance of your 
credit report
If you want to ensure that you do 
not become a victim of identity 
theft it is vital that you become 
familiar with your credit report. 
Your credit report is a document 
which scores your credit rating so 
that lending institutions or service 
providers can decide if they are 
going to offer you credit or not. 
It contains the name of anyone 
you share a financial relationship 
with and also shows when you, or 

Part Three
97
someone claiming to be you, have 
applied for credit and a lender has 
checked your file. Your report also 
contains linked addresses. A linked 
address is created when a lender 
changes the address on a credit 
account or when they receive a 
credit application from an address 
– if credit has been applied for in 
your name your report will contain 
all the addresses from which the 
application has been made. It is 
a good idea to order a copy and 
review what information lenders 

Identity Theft
98
are seeing when you apply for 
credit. 
Ordering a copy from one of the 
credit agencies is simple and costs £2. 
By law, the credit agencies (contact 
details are listed at the end of this book) 
are required to provide you with your 
report within seven working days of 
receipt of your request and payment. 
If you are concerned that you might be 
the victim of identity theft, you should 
request your report; however, more 
immediate action (contacting a lender 
or the police) may be necessary in 

Part Three
99
extreme cases. The following are some 
signs to look out for:
 
You have been unexpectedly 
denied credit even though 
you’re sure that you’re 
credit worthy
 
Your credit/debit card 
statement includes 
charges which you don’t 
recognise
 
Your bank statements 
have not been delivered 
or you notice some other 
mail is missing

Identity Theft
100
 
A debt collection agency 
contacts you regarding a 
debt for goods you never 
purchased or credit you 
never took
 
You are told that you are 
approved or denied credit 
for applications that you 
know nothing about
If you have ordered your report you 
should look for the following:
 
Accounts 
in 
your 
name 
which you do not hold

Part Three
101
 
Credit applications made 
in your name which you 
did not make
 
Searches of your report 
made by companies which 
you never contacted
 
Linked addresses with which 
you have no connection
If you are concerned that some of 
the information held on your credit 
report is incorrect you can make 
an application to have the record 
amended. You can contact the 

Identity Theft
102
credit agency who will then contact 
the lender who mistakenly appears on 
your report. Any amendments will be 
entered when the lender replies and 
take the form of a ‘Notice of Correction’ 
which can be viewed by anyone who 
has accessed your report in the past 
six months and it may infl uence their 
decision. If the information on the 
report suggests that you are the victim 
of identity theft, contact the relevant 
creditors immediately and explain your 
situation.

Part Three
103
What to do in the event 
of identity theft
The most important thing to remember 
is that the problem will not go away if 
you do not take action and it will become 
harder to solve as time goes on. Do not 
ignore it. As previously stated, if you 
suspect your identity has been stolen be 
sure to order a copy of your credit report. 
If the report confi rms your suspicions 
you should take the following steps:
 
Contact one of the credit 
agencies listed at the back 
of this book and inform them 

Identity Theft
104
of the problem. They can help 
you liaise with the lenders 
involved and make sure that 
you are not affected by the 
fraud. If the fraudster 
is still active they will 
place security features on 
your credit report.
 
Contact the CIFAS Protective 
Registration Service. Once 
you have registered, CIFAS 
members such as lenders and 
banks will carry out extra 
checks 
whenever 
anyone, 
including you, applies for 
a ﬁ nancial service using 
your address.

Part Three
105
 
Report 
the 
incident 
immediately to the police 
and 
obtain 
a 
crime 
reference number or some 
other documentation as a 
record of the incident 
– for details on how to 
report crime see http://
www.crimestoppers-uk.org/.
 
When contacting your own 
lenders and the lender 
who 
was 
defrauded 
be 
sure to keep a record of 
communication – record who 
you spoke to and when and 
keep copies of letters 
sent and received.

Identity Theft
106
Other steps to take:
 
If your driving licence has 
been lost or stolen report 
it as soon as you discover 
it missing. For advice on 
what to do if your driving 
licence has been lost or 
stolen 
see: 
http://www.
dvla.gov.uk/drivers.aspx.
 
If your passport is lost or 
stolen report it as soon as 
you discover it missing. 
The Home Ofﬁ ce has set up 
speciﬁ c procedures to be 
followed in the event of lost 
or stolen passports. For 
further information consult 

Part Three
107
the website at http://www.
ips.gov.uk or call 0870 521 
0410.
 
Report all lost or stolen 
cheques, credit/debit cards 
to the issuers and request 
new ones. It is a good idea 
to follow up any telephone 
conversations you have with 
written conﬁ rmation. Once 
your new cards arrive you 
should immediately change 
your PIN – DO NOT continue 
to use a compromised PIN.
 
If you suspect that your 
mail has been stolen or 

Identity Theft
108
a 
redirection 
has 
been 
fraudulently set up in your 
name, contact the Royal 
Mail and inform them of your 
concerns.
Your liability for the 
debt and how to deal with 
creditors 
If you have been the victim of 
identity theft and purchases were 
made or credit advanced in your 
name it is important to remember 
that the debt is not yours. Most 
lending 
institutions 
limit 
your 
liability in the event of fraud to 

Part Three
109
£50 and even then it is common 
practice to waive such a fee. 
There may be times, however, when 
you are contacted for an old fraudulent 
debt, about which you know nothing. 
A loan may have been advanced in 
your name some time ago and the 
creditor is now seeking repayment 
because the identity thief has made 
off  with the money. They may be 
persistent as they are no doubt used 
to people denying their debts every 
day, but make sure that you are fi rm 
with them.

Identity Theft
110
The process of collection will 
usually begin with a series of letters 
and then move on to phone calls 
– they probably won’t turn up on 
your doorstep in the first instance. 
It will assist your case greatly if you 
are able to provide evidence of 
communication with the police and 
credit agencies to the effect that you 
have been a victim of identity theft. 
Sometimes, as with old debts, this 
might be impossible since the call 
from the debt collector is the first 
you will hear of the debt.

Part Three
111
Remember: you have rights, so 
exercise them. If you find that the 
collection agency is acting unfairly 
then you should contact the lending 
institution 
which 
has 
retained 
them and inform them of the unfair 
practices. Guidance from the Office 
of Fair Trading makes it clear that 
lenders must not ignore the unfair 
practices of debt collectors acting 
on their behalf, whether in-house 
or external. Lenders should take 
care in the selection of third parties, 
investigate complaints and take 

Identity Theft
112
action where appropriate. Failure 
to do so will call into question 
their own fitness to hold a credit 
licence. If a collector harasses 
you, you should contact your 
local council’s trading standards 
department. If they threaten you 
physically, contact the police. If 
you start getting final demands 
for things you haven’t bought, you 
can save yourself a lot of trouble 
by responding to them rather than 
ignoring them. Let the agency 
know that it’s not your problem. 

Part Three
113
In the unlikely event that the 
process goes all the way to the 
bailiffs turning up at your door 
unannounced, there are some 
things you should remember:
 
Bailiffs cannot enter your 
property by force unless 
they have been let in on 
a previous visit to collect 
the same debt. They can, 
however, make a peaceful 
entry which means they can 
enter through an open window 
or closed but unlocked door. 
You should always refuse to 
let the bailiff into your 

Identity Theft
114
home as this will ensure 
that they cannot force entry 
if they visit again.
 
Bailiffs cannot seize your 
basic 
household 
goods, 
clothing, bedding and tools 
of a trade. They are not 
allowed 
to 
seize 
goods 
belonging to a person other 
than the debtor but can 
normally seize jointly owned 
goods. The proceeds of any 
sale of jointly owned goods 
would have to be divided 
between the lender and the 
other owner.

Part Three
115
Can I really make a 
difference in the ﬁ ght 
against identity theft? 
As illustrated by the figures at the 
beginning of this book, identity 
theft is on the rise. However, with 
a little extra vigilance on our part 
we can have a profound impact on 
those statistics and, indirectly, on 
the fees we pay to cover the cost 
of such fraud. Lending institutions 
and the government also have a 
role to play, but it is imperative 
that we act responsibly when it 

Identity Theft
116
comes to controlling our personal 
information – we don’t want to 
make it any easier for fraudsters to 
succeed. Identity theft is probably 
going to exist in one form or another 
for years to come; however, with a 
little effort you should be able to 
prevent yourself from becoming 
just another statistic in the fight 
against fraud.
