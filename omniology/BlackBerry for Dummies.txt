About the Authors
Robert Kao is one well-rounded professional. His ability to translate his tech-
nical knowledge and communicate in many languages with users of all types
inevitably led him to develop BlackBerry applications for various financial
firms in New York City — that truly global city. A graduate of Columbia
University — with a Computer Engineering degree, of course — he currently
lives in Somerset, NJ.
Dante Sarigumba has been working with computers for over 13 years.
Currently, he’s writing BlackBerry applications for a major investment bank
in New York. With his engineering background, he’s been a longtime gizmo
enthusiast, which probably explains his interest in BlackBerries. He writes
applications for the BlackBerry platform in his spare time (believe it or not)
and writes the occasional article for the BlackBerry Developer Journal.


Authors’ Acknowledgments
I would like to thank my father (MHK) and mother (SYT) for everything
they’ve done for me because I wouldn’t be here without their kindness and
support. I would also like to thank my lovely wife Marie-Claude and little Jade
for understanding all the weekends and nights that I missed while writing this
book. Finally, I would like to thank Paul, Cathy, little TJ, and rest of my family
for the same.
—Robert Kao
My sincere thanks to Aben Alvarez, Anna Kanyek-Sy, Jun Abad, and Ninky
Avenir for their help and support during the early phase of this book. As
always, my profoundest thanks to my dear wife and soul mate, Yosma, whose
patience and understanding were invaluable during the writing of this book.
—Dante Sarigumba
Collectively, we’d like to thank Eric Giguere for getting us started on the path
of book writing, as well as Carol McClendon, our agent, for her help getting
this book started. Thanks as well to Richard Evers of Research In Motion for
a wealth of information and guidance. For their insights, assistance, and
extraordinary patience, thanks to Jennifer Y. Lee; Veru Narula; and Greg Croy,
Paul Levesque, Teresa Artman, Colleen Totz, and the rest of the Wiley staff.
Without you all, this book would not have been possible.
—Rob & Dante

Introduction
H
i there, and welcome to BlackBerry For Dummies. If you already have a
BlackBerry, this is a great book to have around if you want to discover
new features or you need something to slap open and use as a quick refer-
ence. If you don’t have a BlackBerry yet (but plan to get one) and have some
basic questions (like “What is a BlackBerry?” or “How can a BlackBerry help
me be more productive?”), you can benefit by reading this book cover to
cover. No matter what your current BlackBerry User Status is — BUS, for
short — we’re here to help you get the most out of your BlackBerry.
We can tell you, right off the bat, that a BlackBerry is not a fruit you find at
the supermarket but rather is a) an always-connected handheld device that
b) has e-mail capabilities with an Internet browser built in. With your
BlackBerry, you are in the privileged position of always being able to receive
e-mail and browse the World Wide Web.
On top of that, a BlackBerry has all the features you’d expect from a personal
organizer, including a calendar, to-do lists, and memos. Oh, and did we men-
tion that a BlackBerry also has a mobile phone built in? Talk about multitask-
ing! Imagine being stuck on a commuter train: With your BlackBerry by your
side, you can compose e-mail while conducting a conference call — all from
the comfort of your seat.
In this book, we show you all the basics but then go the extra mile by high-
lighting some of the lesser-known (but still really handy) features of the
BlackBerry. Your BlackBerry can work hard for you when you need it as well
as play hard when you want it to. (Need we say that we’re ready, willing, and
able to show you where to get great games for your BlackBerry?)
About This Book
BlackBerry For Dummies is written to be a comprehensive user guide as well
as a quick user reference guide. This book is designed so that you certainly
can read it cover to cover if you want, but you don’t need to read one chapter
after the other. Feel free to jump around while you explore the different func-
tionalities of your BlackBerry.

We cover basic and advanced topics, but we stick to those that we consider
the most practical and frequently used. So, whether you already know the
basics, you can be certain that if you use/want to use a certain function of
your BlackBerry, we likely cover it here.
Who Are You?
In writing this book, we tried to be considerate of your needs, but because
we’ve never met you, our image of you is as follows. If you find that some of
these images are true about you, this might just be the book for you:
 You have a BlackBerry, and you want to find out how to get the most
from it.
 You don’t have a BlackBerry yet, and you’re wondering what one could
do for you.
 You’re looking for a book that doesn’t assume that you know all the
jargon and tech terms used in the PDA industry. (PDA stands for per-
sonal digital assistant, by the way.) Take that, you jargon, you! 
 You want a reference that shows you, step by step, how to do useful and
cool things with a BlackBerry without bogging you down with unneces-
sary background or theory.
 You’re tired of hauling your ten-pound laptop with you on trips, and
you’re wondering how to turn your BlackBerry into a miniature traveling
office.
 You no longer want to be tied to your desktop system for the critical
activities in your life, such as sending/receiving e-mail, checking your
calendar for appointments, and surfing the Web.
What’s in This Book
BlackBerry For Dummies consists of five parts, and each part consists of dif-
ferent chapters related to that part’s theme.
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry
Part I starts with the basics of your BlackBerry. You know: What it is, what
you can do with it, and what the parts are. We also show you how to 
2
BlackBerry For Dummies 

personalize and express yourself through your BlackBerry. This part wraps
up with must-knows about security and where to go for help when you get
into trouble with your BlackBerry.
Part II: Getting Organized 
with Your BlackBerry
Part II deals with the fact that your BlackBerry is also a full-fledged PDA. We
show you how to get your BlackBerry to keep your contacts in its Address
Book as well as how to manage your appointments and meetings in Calendar.
We also show you how to create a to-do list and have Calendar manage your
to-do’s for you so you don’t miss a task. As you’ll see, most BlackBerry appli-
cations interconnect with one another, working hard for you.
Part III: Getting Online 
with Your BlackBerry
Part III shows you how you can use the true strengths of the BlackBerry — its
always connected e-mail and its Web surfing functionality — but it doesn’t
stop there. We also point out to you how you can use other forms of mes-
sages on the BlackBerry that you might not have known about, such as PIN-
to-PIN messages. To top it off, we show you how to multitask with the built-in
phone along with other BlackBerry applications.
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager
In Part IV, we detail the BlackBerry Desktop Manager and show you some of the
hoops you can put it through with your BlackBerry, including making backups
and installing BlackBerry applications from your PC on to your BlackBerry. And
we didn’t forget to cover important stuff like data synching your appointments/
contacts with desktop applications like Outlook or Lotus Notes.
Part V: The Part of Tens
All For Dummies books include The Part of Tens at the end, and this book is
no different. In Part V, we show you where to get cool BlackBerry accessories,
download useful application, and (of course) get great games to play on your
BlackBerry.

Introduction 

So Many Models, So Little Time
When you first visit the Research In Motion (RIM, the brains behind the
BlackBerry device) Web site, you might be overwhelmed by the many differ-
ent variations of BlackBerry. There are black ones, blue ones, some with col-
ored screens, monochrome ones, ones with QWERTY keyboards, some with a
QWERTY-like keyboard (which RIM calls SureType). . . . Whew!
Don’t worry, it isn’t as complicated as it seems; let us break it down for you.
We generally don’t like to generalize things, but you can pretty much divide
BlackBerry into two categories: the 7100 series and the not-7100 series, which
we refer to in this book as 72xx models. (OK, we could just as easily have
called it the 75xx model or the 87xx model, since they are also not 7100, but
you’ve got to draw the line somethere right?) And why did we make such a
separation? How you operate the 7100 series is a bit different compared with
the 72xx models: The 7100 series uses the RIM SureType keyboard; the 72xx
models have QWERTY keyboards. But just because how it operates is different
doesn’t mean the functions of the 7100 and 72xx series are different. Beneath
the surface, they are quite similar. For example, both the 7100 series and 72xx
models can do e-mail, phone, and address book functions. How you get to
your e-mail or address book application is a bit different in each. It’s that
simple. Of course, there are other small (yet important) differences, which we
denote in this book with a 7100 icon (see the following section).
This book is written with the latest model of the 7100 series and 72xx models
in mind. If you have a slightly older model, not to worry; you can still find this
book quite useful because the functionality is still similar. You just might dis-
cover, however, that some of the newer functions we cover in this book may
not be available on your particular (older) BlackBerry.
Icons in This Book
Text marked with this icon applies to only the BlackBerry 7100 series.
If a paragraph sports this icon, it means we’re talking about BlackBerry
devices that are provided by your employer.
This book rarely delves into the geeky, technical details, but when it does,
this icon warns you. Read on if you want to get under the hood a little, or just
skip ahead if you aren’t interested in the gory details.

ecause you’re reading this book, you probably have a BlackBerry (um,
and we’re pretty sure that you’re not eating it). We’re just curious,
though — what actually convinced you to buy this particular handheld
mobile device? Was it the always-connected e-mail? Or the wireless calendar
sync? Was it the QWERTY keyboard? Or was it the really good sales pitch? 
We know; the list could go on and on — and we might never hit on the exact
reason why you got yours. In fact, for some of you, your company simply
handed you one. But for whichever reason you bought or acquired your
BlackBerry, congratulations; you made an intelligent choice.
The same smarts that made you buy or obtain your BlackBerry are clearly at
it again. This time, your native intelligence led you to pick up this book, per-
haps because your intuition is telling you that there’s more to this whole
BlackBerry than meets the eye.
Your hunch is right. Your BlackBerry can help you do more things than you
could ever think of. For example, your BlackBerry is a whiz at making phone
calls, but it’s also a device that you can use to check your e-mail as well as
surf the Web. We’re talking World Wide Web here, so the sky’s the limit. Help
is always at your fingertips rather than sitting on some desk at home or at
the office. Need to check out the reviews of that restaurant there on the

corner? Need to see (right now) what’s showing in your local movie theaters,
or what the weather will be like later tonight, or the best place to shop? Need
to get directions to that cozy bed and breakfast, or news headlines, or stock
quotes? Want to do some online chatting or view some pictures online? You
can do all these things (and more) by using your BlackBerry.
BlackBerry is also a full-fledged personal digital assistant (PDA). Out of the
box, it provides you with the organizational tools you need to set up to-do
lists, manage your appointments, take care of your address books, and more.
Being armed with a device that’s a phone, an Internet connection, and a PDA
all built into one makes you a power person. With your BlackBerry (along
with this resourceful book), you really can increase your productivity and
better organize yourself. Watch out, world! Person bearing a BlackBerry
coming through!
If you stick with us throughout this book, you’ll find out all you need to get
the most out of your device or maybe even stave off (or save) a troubled 
relationship. (Well, the last one is a bit of an exaggeration, but we got your
attention, right?)
Know Your BlackBerry History
Your BlackBerry is truly a wondrous thing, boasting many features beyond
your ordinary mobile phone. And its “sudden” popularity didn’t happen
overnight. Like any other good product out there, BlackBerry has come a
long way from its (relatively humble) beginnings.
In the days when the Palm Pilot ruled the PDA world, Research In Motion (RIM;
the maker of the BlackBerry) was busy in its lab, ignoring the then-popular
graffiti input method to design its own device with the QWERTY keyboard —
the kind of keyboard people were already used to from working on their PCs.
RIM didn’t stop there, however. It also added an always-connected e-mail
capability, making this device a must-have among government officials as
well as professionals in the finance and health industries.
To meet the needs of government officials and industry professionals, RIM
made reliability, security, and durability the priorities when manufacturing 
its devices. Today, the BlackBerry comes from the same line of RIM family
products, inheriting all the good genes while boosting usability and adding
more functions to its core BlackBerry applications. As a result, not only is
BlackBerry popular among prosumers (professional customers) but among
consumers as well.
10
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

Throughout the book, you’ll see sections that apply to prosumers/enterprise
users, indicated by the icon you see here in the margin. If your BlackBerry
was given to you by your employer and your device is set up so that you can
use only your company e-mail address for e-mailing, you can consider your-
self an enterprise user.
On the other hand, if you bought your BlackBerry on your own from a net-
work service provider, like T-Mobile, consider yourself a consumer.
Why the division? It’s simple. A few features, such as the wireless address
book lookup or wireless calendar sync, need the BlackBerry Enterprise
Server to be connected to a central e-mail server. Such a connection is often
available in large corporations, but no individuals that we could think of
would have their own private BlackBerry Enterprise Server. (Although any-
thing’s possible, we suppose.)
How It All Works: The 
Schematic Approach
For those of you who always ask, “How do they do that?” you don’t have to
go far; this little section is just for you.
The role of the network service provider
Along with wondering how your BlackBerry actually works, you might also be
wondering why you didn’t get your BlackBerry from RIM instead of a network
service provider like Cingular or T-Mobile? Why did you need to go through a
middle-person? After all, RIM makes BlackBerry.
Those are excellent questions — and here’s quick-and-dirty answer. RIM
needs a delivery system — a communication medium, as it were — for its
technology to work. Not in a position to come up with such a delivery system
all by its lonesome, RIM partnered (and built alliances across the globe) with
what developed into its network service providers — the usual suspects
(meaning the big cellphone companies). These middle-providers support the
wireless network for your BlackBerry so that you have signals to connect to
the BlackBerry Internet Service — meaning that you can get all those won-
derful e-mails (and waste so much valuable time surfing the Internet). See
Figure 1-1 for a schematic overview of this process.
11
Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Is NOT an Edible Fruit?

Network service providers don’t build alliances for nothing, right? In return,
RIM gave them the right to brand their names on the BlackBerry they offer
for sale. For example, a T-Mobile 7100t looks different from a similar model
you get from Vodafone. Which leads to another question: Do BlackBerry func-
tionalities actually differ from phone model to phone model? Quick answer:
On the core BlackBerry applications (such as Tasks and Address Book), 
you find no major differences. However, some BlackBerry features, such 
as Instant Messaging, might or might not be supported by the network 
service provider. (See Chapter 9 for more details on Instant Messaging.)
Just to keep the scorecard straight, when we come across features available
from one network service provider that aren’t available from other providers,
we’ll be sure to point them out.
Connecting to your personal computer
Nowadays, a personal computer is a household necessity. We spend so 
much time on them, and so much information is stored in them. No surprise,
BlackBerry works hand in hand with your PC. The USB cable that comes with
your BlackBerry does more than just charge your device. All the chapters in
Part IV of this book are dedicated to guide you in making use of this impor-
tant connection with the help of the BlackBerry Desktop Manager and all the
Web servers

utilities that come with it. You will find discussions in Chapter 11 on how to
sync your device with the Personal Information Manager data that you keep
in your PC. Chapter 12 talks about installing new applications to your
BlackBerry with the help of your PC. You can also read Chapter 13 for direc-
tions on how to use the Redirector application in the desktop to set up filters
on your e-mails. Lastly, Chapter 14 guides you on how to back up almost any-
thing in your BlackBerry, down to your desktop.
Connecting to the Enterprise
Down, Trekkies! We’re not talking about hooking up with Captain Kirk or Lt.
Uhuru. RIM’s initial markets were enterprises and governments, and e-mail
was the key to RIM’s success. And yet, BlackBerry is so much more than
simply e-mail capability, and enterprises and governments quickly figured
that out. A company that uses BlackBerry service has the option of integrat-
ing e-mail service as well as calendaring to its own enterprise software:
Microsoft Exchange, Lotus Domino, or whatever. Such software likely existed
on the company network before it started using BlackBerry, so the company
was already heavily invested in it. RIM’s decision to enable integration of its
service within the frameworks of existing enterprise servers made good busi-
ness sense.
The BlackBerry Enterprise Server
So how does it work? To integrate corporate e-mails and calendaring, RIM
provides a connector to its service to and from a corporate network. This
software is BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES), which is the glue that con-
nects the RIM network with a corporate network. Using BES, a company can
have full control over what its employees can and cannot do with their
devices. For example, a company’s BES administrator could opt to disable
PIN-to-PIN (personal identification number) messaging. This messaging
system is supposedly more private than sending messages between e-mail
accounts because PIN messages are sent directly from one device to another
without going through a central corporate server. (See Chapter 9 for more
details about PIN-to-PIN messaging.) A company’s administrator can also
enable or disable downloading and installation of applications to your device.
Such control provides important flexibility for a corporation when security is
an integral part of day-to-day operation.
One of the most important features of BlackBerry Enterprise Server is its
Mobile Data Service (MDS). MDS answers the challenge of extending corpo-
rate data within the corporate network without jeopardizing security. MDS
allows companies to make all BlackBerry browsers follow the existing con-
straints of Internet browsers inside a corporate network. For example, if the
13
Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Is NOT an Edible Fruit?

firewalls on your corporate network prevent you from going to potentially
malicious sites, you’re not going to be able to use your BlackBerry browser
to go to said sites — the same rules apply, in other words. This is all achieved
by MDS. With MDS, your BlackBerry can be considered part of your corpo-
rate network, following all the rules that your network firewalls are set up to
enforce.
Connecting wirelessly
From the get-go, e-mail is always connected to your e-mail server wirelessly.
Then comes calendaring, where your appointments are synchronized to your
company’s calendaring system. RIM did not stop there. Version 4.0 of BES is 
a leap forward for the BlackBerry platform. It supports this new buzzword
wireless everything sync, absolutely allowing you to sync all your PIM data
(including notes, tasks, and address book) wirelessly. Most of the utilities you
found in the desktop side can now be accomplished wirelessly. In essence,
you don’t need the desktop, but it’s your choice.
Connecting via desktop computer
In addition to the wireless side of BlackBerry, there’s also the wired side of
connecting to enterprise data. The same utilities and functions that are avail-
able to you if you have a personal device are available to you when you have
a BlackBerry from your company. But there’s more in version 4.0 of your
device OS and 4.0 of BES. RIM deployed the Handheld Manager for the desk-
top. This application allows the device to use the network connection in your
PC for any communication to the BES. In essence, if your device is connected
to your company’s PC and the Handheld Manager is running, any e-mails do
not go through the phone provider’s network. They go straight from your
e-mail server to the BES server and to your device.
Doing the BlackBerry world-traveler thing
Two dominant technologies compete in the worldwide cellphone industry
today:
 Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA): This is available in the United
States through Verizon Wireless.
 Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM): This is a tad older
than its CDMA rival.
Nothing stands still in this world, and this saying is proven by the fact that
GSM has spawned Global Packet Radio Service (GPRS), a second-generation
technology that has been growing in popularity because it works on the same
GSM phone infrastructure. This combo GSM/GPRS is also available in the U.S.
through most of the major network service providers. As you might have
guessed, GSM/GPRS competes in the marketplace against CDMA.
14
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

Why is this a factor? Or, to put this more bluntly, what’s it to you? Well, because
CDMA and GSM/GPRS aren’t compatible with each other — which is what hap-
pens when you have competing technologies going for all the marbles in the
marketplace — your phone works on only one technology. When you travel
outside North America, you face the burning question: “CDMA or GSM/GPRS?”
(The non-acronym version of this question is “Will my BlackBerry work on this
country’s network or won’t it?”) If you currently work with GSM/GPRS, you
should be okay because most non-North American countries are on GSM/GPRS
networks. If you’re a CDMA kind of person, you might have some “issues,” as
they say. When in doubt, talk to your network service provider.
Oh, the Things You Can Do!
Always-connected e-mail is still what makes BlackBerry very attractive and is
likely first in the long list of reasons why you got your BlackBerry in the first
place. And, if you need to go global, you can use your BlackBerry in 30 coun-
tries. Just hop off your flight, turn on your BlackBerry, and voilà!: e-mails on
your BlackBerry while you’re 6,000 miles away from home. You can receive and
send e-mails whether you are in Hong Kong, London, Paris, or New York. Your
significant other can get in touch with you wherever you are — just to say hi or
to remind you that you’d promised Aunt Edna a case of Chanel No. 5. (One
caveat here — you need to make sure that your network service provider has
the technology to go global. See the earlier “Doing the BlackBerry world-traveler
thing” section for more info.) Generally speaking, you can receive and send
e-mails just like when you’re at home.
Although e-mail is BlackBerry’s strength, that’s not the only thing it can do.
This section goes beyond e-mail to point out some of the other major benefits
you can get from your device.
Internet at your fingertips
Yup, you can browse the Web with your BlackBerry. Even better, you can 
continue chatting with your friends through Instant Messenger, just as if you
never left your desktop computer. You can also get up-to-the-minute informa-
tion when you want it, when you need it. Just imagine getting an alert when
your stock is tanking. True, that’s not a good thing to happen, but this infor-
mation is critical for you to act in a timely manner.
If you’re not into stocks, how about getting sports and weather information?
Or maybe traffic alerts? Say you want to know the best restaurants in town
for that special evening — birthday, anniversary, first date, or whatever.
Many services that are available on the Internet are also available to you on
your BlackBerry.
15
Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Is NOT an Edible Fruit?

Intrigued? Your questions about how your BlackBerry can take advantage of
the Web are answered in due time (in Chapter 10 of this book, to be precise).
Me and my great personal assistant
You might be saying, “But I’m really a busy person, and I don’t have time to
browse the Web. What I do need is an assistant to help me better organize my
day-to-day tasks.” If you can afford one, by all means go ahead and hire a per-
sonal assistant. If not, the next best thing is a personal digital assistant (PDA).
Many PDAs are on the market today, the most popular ones being those mar-
keted by Palm and WinCE. Getting a PDA can be a big help — and mucho less
expensive than hiring a secretary.
So, are we telling you to go out and buy a PDA? No way! Put away that credit
card because you don’t need to go that route.
Whip out that BlackBerry of yours and take a closer look. That’s right, your
BlackBerry is also a full-fledged PDA, able to help you remember all your
acquaintances (see Chapter 3), manage your appointments (Chapter 4), keep
a to-do list (Chapter 5), and much more.
In Chapters 3–6 of this book, you can read up on all the tricks and tips for
managing your life using your BlackBerry. Heck, we even show you how your
BlackBerry calendar can be wirelessly synced with your Outlook calendar
(Chapter 7). Talk about an informational cornucopia!
A computer in the palm of your hand
A remarkable communication device? Check. A full-fledged PDA? Check. Yup,
a BlackBerry is a pretty sophisticated product, but what we’ve described so
far is just the tip of the iceberg. Don’t underestimate the device because of its
size: Your BlackBerry is, in reality, a pretty powerful computer despite its
small size.
Need convincing? Here goes. Out of the box, it comes with a great set of orga-
nizational as well as productivity tools. These tools are really just programs
developed by RIM to run on this device firmware (its operating system; OS).
You can find out more about these tools in the rest of the book: Chapter 4
talks about managing your appointments; Chapter 5 details how to keep track
of your tasks and keep your password safe in a central location; and Chapter
6 guides you in using your BlackBerry for taking notes and making calcula-
tions. In Chapter 8, you will also find more on messaging tools for enhanced
16
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

collaborations. With the growing popularity of the device, software develop-
ers outside of RIM are taking advantage of this growing market — which
means literally hundreds of applications are now out there for you to down-
load.
Download? Absolutely! BlackBerry supports the downloading of applications
through the BlackBerry Browser. And of course, it’s wireless. (See Chapter 9.)
For example, you can download more productivity tools like spreadsheet
applications or applications to view and edit office documents written in
Word or other word processing programs. The number of BlackBerry applica-
tions is growing — and growing fast.
To be honest, there’s no way to foresee how many applications will be on the
market when this book  is published. And the price of an application varies,
depending on how sophisticated the program is, so we can’t really give firm
numbers right now. But if you’re curious, check out Chapter 17, where we
describe some of the best business applications out there. You should be
able to find some treasures suited to your field of work.
Does all this talk about productivity tools make your eyes glaze over? Well, “All
work and no play” does something or other, so we have no qualms about shift-
ing toward the more fun topics, such as games. BlackBerry comes out of the
box supplied with just a single game, but you should look upon this merely as
an appetizer (or at least the free candy that gets you wanting more). If do find
yourself wanting more, go to the candy store — that is, the Web — to find an
infinite variety of games designed for your BlackBerry. Chapter 18 highlights
some of the more fun games out there, all available for downloading.
Look Dad, no hands!
Your BlackBerry comes equipped with an earphone that doubles as a mike
for hands-free talking. This accessory is your doctor’s prescription for pre-
venting the stiff neck that comes from wedging your BlackBerry with your
shoulder against your ear. At the very minimum, it helps free your hands so
you can eat Chinese take-out. And, if you happen to be a New York resident,
you’re required by law to use an earphone while driving when you use a cell-
phone. (Not that we recommend using your cellphone while driving, but if
you really need to make that call, going hands-free is better and safer.)
But RIM didn’t stop with just your standard (wired) earphones. BlackBerry
also supports cool, new wireless earphones/mikes — the ones based on
Bluetooth technology. “But how could a bizarrely colored tooth help me
here?” you might ask. Fooled you! Bluetooth is a codename for a (very) 
short-distance wireless technology first used to connect simple devices
17
Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Is NOT an Edible Fruit?

like computer accessories, but that is now becoming more common on cell-
phones, specifically on wireless earphones/mikes.
Because Bluetooth is a relatively new technology, this feature is available on
only the more recent BlackBerry models. When it is available, you have an
option to enable and disable it. (See Chapter 10 for details on turning
Bluetooth On or Off.)
Going new look or traditional: 
Your BlackBerry choices
If you check out RIM’s BlackBerry Web site — found at www.blackberry.com,
strangely enough — you can find two broad categories of models in terms of
look and feel: the new-looking BlackBerry (the 7100 series) and the traditional
BlackBerry (everything else). To be honest, the new-looking 7100 series doesn’t
break any radically new ground in terms of industrial design — the devices
have just been slimmed down so they look more like a largish cellphone (a bit
easier to hold on to). The traditional-looking BlackBerry, on the other hand,
looks pretty much like all the other clunky PDAs out there.
The big question, then, is what the differences are between the two types,
other than their looks. To be honest, not much. Both types use the same
underlying software; both have wireless e-mail, phone, and Internet browsing
capabilities. The subtle differences involve things like the use of the SureType
keyboard on the 7100 models and the option of a couple of different ways to
get to the same applications. In addition, most of the 7100 models have more
graphical icons as well as high-resolution screens — which means you get a
sharper display with the 7100s than with most other BlackBerries.
Given the lack of profound differences between the two types, you might
wonder why RIM went for the different look. As we mention earlier, the 7100
model does look more like a cellphone than the traditional BlackBerry, which
leads us to conclude that its target audience is made up of heavy phone users
who also want all the functions of a BlackBerry. But is one model in any way
better than the other? That really depends on the type of user you are. For
example, most business users are inclined to use e-mail more. As such, the
traditional-looking BlackBerry is the preference for most of these companies.
When it comes to personal users, however, they are probably more inclined
to be heavy phone users — which would mean that the 7100 would probably
have a bit more appeal for them.
Although RIM markets the 7100 to heavy phone users, the 7100 is just as capa-
ble as the rest of the BlackBerry models. You can do the same kinds of tasks on
a 7100 as you would on any other BlackBerry models just keep in mind that
how you perform those same tasks might be slightly different. (To help you
keep these differences straight, we plunk down a 7100 icon just like the one you
see here in the margin whenever we give you some 7100-specific instructions.

Anatomy 101: The Body and 
Features of Your BlackBerry
Progress being what it is, every new model of BlackBerry comes better
equipped than the previous one. But generally speaking, most of the improve-
ments have occurred under the hood, which means that what you actually
see outside has remained relatively constant. No matter what type of
BlackBerry you have, then, you’re going to find the following four basic fea-
tures, as shown in Figures 1-2 and 1-3:
 Display screen: Graphic user interface (GUI) of the BlackBerry
 QWERTY keyboard: Input for the BlackBerry
 Escape button: Button used to cancel a selection

Display screen
When you first turn on your BlackBerry, the display screen displays the
Home screen, which is your introduction to the GUI of your BlackBerry. The
GUI represents the different applications found in your BlackBerry using
graphic icons. Through the GUI, you can access your device’s applications
and features.
When checking out those icons, just remember that how your own GUI looks
depends on how you want it to look. The font and theme are all customizable.
For more on personalizing your BlackBerry, see Chapter 2.
On the 7100 models, you might not see icons per se the first time you turn on
your BlackBerry. Depending on the theme you’re using, you might see your
applications listed in text form rather than as icons, as shown in Figure 1-4.
(See Chapter 2 for more on customizing your theme.)

QWERTY keyboard
Unlike some PDA manufacturers out there — they know who they are — RIM
chose the same QWERTY keyboard you know and love from your personal
computer as the input method for the BlackBerry. We think that was a great
decision because it means we don’t have to learn some new way of writing —
graffiti or whatever — to get data into our BlackBerry. All we have to do is
type on a keyboard — and we already know how to do that.
Whether you use your pinky or your index finger, how you type on your
BlackBerry is up to you. Most people do, however, find that typing with 
two thumbs is the more efficient way to type on a BlackBerry.

Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Is NOT an Edible Fruit?

The 7100 model doesn’t have a full QWERTY keyboard; rather, it works with a
QWERTY-based keyboard known as the SureType keyboard. The idea here is
that many keys share letters (refer to Figure 1-2 to see how this looks) and
that the SureType technology is smart enough to learn what key combina-
tions come up with the words you want. Basically, with SureType, you can
now type with only one thumb, and your BlackBerry learns the words that
you frequently use.
Here are tips to speed up the learning curve when using SureType technology:
 Always finish typing a word before correcting it. This way, SureType
learns what you want to type next time.
 If SureType got the word you’re typing right on the first try, simply
use the spacebar to move on instead of clicking the trackwheel or
pressing ENTER.
 Type! Type! Type! Because SureType learns how you type, the more
you use it, the smarter it becomes in adapting to your style.
For more tips on mastering SureType, see Chapter 2.

Final BlackBerry Tidbits!
The main concerns most of us have when buying a product are quality and
reliability. Will the product last? Will it perform as the flier says? Will I regret
having bought this item six months down the road? This section looks at
24
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

some of the hardware features that make buying the BlackBerry device a 
wise purchase.
Power efficiency
Now, anyone who has had an ear to the ground regarding BlackBerry knows
its reputation as a highly efficient little machine when it comes to power con-
sumption. If you have/had the old 62xx series, you know that the device
could run for two weeks without recharging. Right at the onset, RIM designed
and made its devices to consume power effectively.
With the addition of colored and high-resolution screens, the much-vaunted
power efficiency has gone down somewhat, especially with newer models like
the 7100 series. Power requirements on these devices have now increased to
such an extent that you need to recharge roughly every two to three days.
Realizing that this is a bit of a hassle, we offer a section in Chapter 2 where
we spell out some tips on prolonging the life of your battery, especially when
you’re traveling.
Memory management
We know that memory is the last thing on people’s mind when they buy a
BlackBerry. Not many know the role ample memory plays for a device because
you definitely have ample free memory on your device when you first receive
it. The thing is, though, that this memory does not grow as you use BlackBerry.
You’re stuck with a fixed amount of memory, which can prove limiting over
time. As you install more and more applications, this free memory gets used
up. In fact, you could eventually run out of memory altogether.
Does your device die when you run out of memory? No, thank goodness. Your
BlackBerry is quite capable of monitoring the free memory on your device. If
you’re ever in danger of reaching your upper limits, your BlackBerry has a
memory management that cleans house to free this limited resource.
BlackBerry applications right out of the box are capable of figuring out what
data just isn’t that important. For example, the BlackBerry Browser caches
data in order to enhance your experience when browsing the Web. Caches
use local copies of Web pages to speed up the reloading of previously visited
Web sites, so they are generally good things to have around. However, this
cache also takes up space. When the OS tells Browser that the device is
reaching its upper memory limit and that it needs to do some house cleaning,
Browser deletes this cache. This is also true for Message, which deletes
e-mails you’ve already read, starting from the oldest and working its way
backward.
25
Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Is NOT an Edible Fruit?

Curious about how much available space your device has? Using your track-
wheel, scroll to highlight Options on the BlackBerry Home screen and then
press the trackwheel. Scroll through the list and click Status. In the Status
screen, File Free is the field that tells you how much available space is left.
On the 7100 models, you can find Options in the Tools.
On models other than 7100, a shortcut is available to get to the HelpME
screen, which among other information also shows File Free. Simply press
Alt+CAP+H together and the HelpME screen appears.
A sentry is always on duty
Throughout the history of human existence, we’ve seen some nasty things
that human beings are capable of doing. Unfortunately, the virtual world is
not exempt; in fact, every day a battle is fought between those who are trying
to attack a system and those who are trying to protect it. Included among
those attacking the system are those who are trying to steal corporate data
for their advantage, as well as individuals trying to steal personal data in
order to carry out identity theft.
A computer connected to the Internet faces an extra risk of being hacked or
becoming infected by a computer virus intent on simply annoying the heck out
of you or (even worse) wreaking havoc on your computer. Fortunately, security
is one of the strong points of the BlackBerry. RIM has built into its software fea-
tures that allow companies to curtail activities for their BlackBerry users that
they deem risky, such as installing or running a third-party application. Data
transmitted on and from the device are encrypted so that possible snooping is
prevented. RIM also has a Signature process for application developers, which
forces developers to identify themselves and their programs if they are devel-
oping any applications running on the BlackBerry platform that need to inte-
grate with either BlackBerry core applications or the OS.
Remember the I love you and Anna Kournikova viruses? These are virtual
evils transmitted through e-mail, a script, or sets of instructions in the e-mail
body or attachment that can be executed either by the host e-mail program
or, in the case of an attachment, by the program that is associated with the
attached file. Fortunately, BlackBerry’s Messages does not support scripting
languages. As for attachments, out of the box BlackBerry supports very few
file types, mostly images and text documents. BlackBerry’s viewer for such
files doesn’t support scripting either, so you won’t be facing threats from
e-mails having these attachments.
The security measures RIM implemented on the BlackBerry platform have
gained the trust of the U.S. government as well as many of the Forbes Top 500
enterprises in the financial and health industries.

egardless of how long you’ve had your BlackBerry — one week, one
month, one year, or five years — you’ll want to have it around for as long
as you possibly can. (Or, at least, until you have the bucks for that way-cool
new model that’s surely coming down the pike.) And, for the duration that you
do have your device, you’ll want to trick it out so that your BlackBerry doesn’t
feel and sound exactly like the couple of millions of other BlackBerry devices
out there. (C’mon, admit it — your BlackBerry is definitely a fashion state-
ment, so you better feel comfortable with what that statement is saying.)
In addition to customizing your BlackBerry so that it expresses the inner 
you, you want to make sure that you keep your BlackBerry in tip-top shape
by watching out for things like your BlackBerry battery life and information
security. Luckily for you, this chapter puts any and all such worries to rest by
filling you in on all you need to know to keep your BlackBerry a finely-tuned
(and yet quirkily personal) little PDA.
Making Your BlackBerry YOURS
BlackBerry devices are increasingly popular, so much so that close to 
three million BlackBerries are out there serving the needs of people like you.
Because of this fact, we’re certain that finding ways to distinguish your
BlackBerry from your colleagues’ BlackBerries is high on your list of priorities.

Your wish is our command. Follow the tips and techniques outlined in this
section and you, too, can have your very own personalized BlackBerry.
Branding your BlackBerry
Like any number of other electronic gadgets that you could possibly own,
your BlackBerry comes to you off the shelf fitted out with a collection of
rather white-bread factory settings. This section helps you put your name on
your BlackBerry, both figuratively and literally. You can start by branding
your name on your BlackBerry:
1. Highlight the Options (Settings) application from the BlackBerry
Home screen and press the trackwheel.
2. Scroll through the list of options until you find the Owner setting and
then press the trackwheel.
You see places to enter your owner information.
3. Enter your name in the Name field and then enter your contact infor-
mation in the Information field.
The idea here is to phrase a message (like the one shown in Figure 2-1)
that would make sense to any possible Good Samaritan who might find
your lost BlackBerry and want to get it back to you.
If you lock or don’t use your BlackBerry for a while, the standby screen
comes on, displaying the owner information that you entered into the
Options (Settings) screen. Read how to lock your BlackBerry, either
Figure 2-1:
List your
owner info
here.
28
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

manually or by using an auto setting, as described in the later section,
“Keeping Your BlackBerry Safe.”
4. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackwheel and then choosing
Save from the contextual menu that appears.
Choose a language, any language
Branding your BlackBerry with your own John Hancock is a good start, but
setting the language to your native tongue so you don’t need to hire a transla-
tor to use your BlackBerry is equally important — and equally easy. You can
also set your input method of choice here, which can affect whether your
AutoText shows up. Don’t worry. We explain what that means.
Here’s how it’s done:
1. Highlight Options (Settings) from the BlackBerry Home screen and
press the trackwheel.
2. Scroll through the list of options until you find the Language setting
and then press the trackwheel.
Here you can choose the language and input method of your choice.
3. Select the Language field and scroll the drop-down menu until you see
your native tongue.
Depending on your network provider, as well as what region (North
America, Europe, and so on) you’re in, the language choices you have
vary. Most handhelds sold in North America default to English or English
(United States).
If your network provider supports it, you can install more languages into
your BlackBerry by using the Application Loader in the BlackBerry
Desktop Manager. For more information on Application Loader, please
see Chapter 12.
4. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackwheel and then choosing
Save from the contextual menu that appears.
Isn’t it great when you can actually read what’s onscreen? But don’t
think that you’re done quite yet. You’ve still got some personalizing 
to do.
Typing with ease using AutoText
Even the most devoted BlackBerry user has to admit that typing on a full key-
board is easier than thumb-typing on a BlackBerry. In an attempt to even the
29
Chapter 2: Turning On Your BlackBerry (And Keeping It Happy)

score a bit, your BlackBerry comes equipped with an AutoText feature, which
is a kind of shorthand that can help you cut down on how much you actually
have to type. Even if you have the 7100 model with SureType technology, you
can still benefit by using the AutoText feature. (For more on SureType tech-
nology, see Chapter 1.)
AutoText basically works with a pool of abbreviations that you set up — you
then just type an abbreviation to get the word you associated with that
abbreviation. For example, after setting up b/c as an AutoText word, anytime
you type b/c, you automatically get because onscreen.
The whole AutoText thing works only if you set up your own personal code,
mapping your abbreviations to their meanings. (This is why we’re discussing
AutoText as part of our personalization discussion.) To set up your own
code, do the following:
1. Highlight Options (Settings) from the BlackBerry Home screen and
press the trackwheel.
2. Scroll through the list of options until you find AutoText and then
press the trackwheel.
Here, you can choose to either see (or search for) existing AutoText
words or create new ones.
3. Select New from the contextual menu and press the trackwheel.
The AutoText screen appears, as shown in Figure 2-2.
4. In the Replace field, enter the characters that you want to replace (in
this example, b/c). Then type what replaces your characters in the
With field (in this example, because).
Figure 2-2:
Create
AutoText
here.
30

5. In the Using field, choose between the SmartCase and Specified Case
options.
• SmartCase capitalizes the first letter when the context calls for
that, such as the first word in a sentence.
• Specified Case replaces your AutoText with the exact text found in
the With field.
For example, say you have an AutoText bbg set up for the term 
blackberryGoodies.com, and you want it to appear as is, in terms of letter
cases (the first b is not capitalized). If you were to choose SmartCase for
this particular AutoText, then it would be capitalized as the first word in
a sentence, which is NOT what you want to achieve. On the other hand,
if you use Specified Case, your AutoText always appears as
blackberryGoodies.com no matter where it is in the sentence.
6. In the Language field, specify whether this particular AutoText applies
only to a specific language input method or to all language input
methods.
Our preference for this setting for any self-created AutoText is All
Locales, which is one of the choices for this field. What this means is
that no matter what language input method (English UK or English US or
French), any self-created AutoText will be available for you to use. So, in
the case of the AutoText bbg (blackberryGoodies.com), whether you 
are typing in French or Chinese, you can use this AutoText. On the other
hand, if you select only the French input method for bbg as the language
field, you would be able to use this only if your input method is set to
French in the language option.
You can choose the input method of your choice in the Language
options. We go over choosing a language input method next.
7. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackwheel and then choosing
Save from the contextual menu that appears.
In the case where you specify a language input method other than All
Locales, in order for you to use your newly created AutoText, you need to
make sure that your input method setting in the Language option matches:
1. Highlight Options (Settings) from the BlackBerry Home screen and
press the trackwheel.
2. Scroll through the list of options until you find the Language setting
and then press the trackwheel.
Here you can choose the language and input method of your choice.
3. Select the Input Method field and scroll down the drop-down menu
until you see the input method you need.
31
Chapter 2: Turning On Your BlackBerry (And Keeping It Happy)

In order for your new AutoText setting to work (assuming that you didn’t
choose All Locales as language for your AutoText), this option needs to
match.
4. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackwheel and then choosing
Save from the contextual menu that appears.
Inserting macros
If you frequently give out your BlackBerry phone number or your PIN within
e-mails, you’ll appreciate macros. Basically, you can use the AutoText feature
to add a customized word for preset items — things like your BlackBerry
number, PIN, or just the date — so you don’t have to type them all the time.
Keep in mind that we’re talking about your BlackBerry PIN here — your
device’s unique identifying number — and not the PIN someone would use to
empty out your checking account with the help of one of those automated
tellers. For more on BlackBerry PINs, see Chapter 8.
To add a macro for your phone number, for example, first call up the
AutoText screen. (AutoText is one of the options in Options [Settings].) Type
an appropriate word in the Replace field (mynum would work nicely), scroll
to the With field, choose Insert Macro from the field’s drop-down menu, and
then click the trackwheel. You’re prompted with a popup to select from a list
of preset items; be sure to scroll to the Phone Number (%p) option.
After saving your setting, you can test your AutoText by drafting a simple
e-mail.
Getting your dates and times lined up
Having the correct date, time, and time zone is quite important when it
comes to your BlackBerry for, we hope, quite obvious reasons. Many of 
the fine features that make up the BlackBerry core experience, as it were,
depend on the time, date, and time zone being accurate.
Need an example? How about your BlackBerry calendar events? Imagine, if
you will, that you have set up a make-or-break meeting with a client for 9 a.m.
EST your time — in Paris, France, which is in who-knows-what time zone. You
definitely want to be on time for that appointment, but you probably won’t be
if you’re planning on your BlackBerry to remind you — that is, if you haven’t
set up the appropriate date, time, and time zone. So go ahead and do the nec-
essary things.
32
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

1. Highlight Options (Settings) from the BlackBerry Home screen and
press the trackwheel.
2. Scroll through the list of options until you find the Date/Time setting
and then press the trackwheel.
The Date/Time screen appears.
3. Highlight the Time Zone field, press the trackwheel, and then choose
Change Option from the contextual menu that appears.
A drop-down list of time zones appears.
4. Scroll to the time zone you are in and press the trackwheel.
The Date/Time screen confirms the time zone that you select.
5. Continuing down the Date/Time screen, select the Month field, press
the trackwheel, and then choose Change Option from the contextual
menu that appears.
You’re prompted with an edit box with a current date setting.
6. Use the trackwheel to scroll to the proper month and then press the
trackwheel.
You can see from the Date/Time screen that the Month field has been
set.
7. Perform Steps 5 and 6 for the Date and Year fields.
Note: If your BlackBerry is in network coverage, just press the track-
wheel and choose Copy Network Time from the contextual menu that
appears. The date is automatically entered into this field, as shown in
Figure 2-3. (The Copy Network Time command sets both the date and
the time.)
Figure 2-3:

8. Continuing down the Date/Time screen, highlight the Hour field, press
the trackwheel, and then choose Change Option from the contextual
menu that appears.
You’re prompted with an edit box with the current time setting.
9. Use the trackwheel to scroll to the proper time and then press the
trackwheel.
You can see from the Date/Time screen that the Hour field has been set.
10. Perform Steps 8 and 9 for the Minute field.
Note: Similarly, if your BlackBerry is in network coverage, you can press
the trackwheel and select Request Time from the contextual menu that
appears. (Refer to Figure 2-3.) This is the quickest way to set the time 
on your BlackBerry. Note, however, that this sets only the time, not the
date.
11. Continuing down the Date/Time screen, highlight the Auto Time Set
field, press the trackwheel, and then choose Change Option from the
contextual menu that appears.
A simple Enabled/Disabled drop-down menu appears. To have
BlackBerry auto-adjust to Daylight Savings Time, enable the Auto Time
Set field.
12. To confirm your changes, press the trackwheel, and then choose Save
from the contextual menu that appears.
Doing so saves your date and time settings in perpetuity — a really long
time, in other words.
Customizing your screen’s look and feel
Right up there with making sure that your date and time settings are accurate
is getting the display font, font size, and screen contrast to your liking. Now we
know that some of you don’t give a hoot if your fonts are Batang or Bookman
as long as you can read the text, but we also know that some of you won’t stop
configuring the fonts until you get them absolutely right. For all you tweakers
out there, here’s how you play around with your BlackBerry fonts:
1. Highlight Options (Settings) from the BlackBerry Home screen and
press the trackwheel.
2. Scroll through the list of options until you find the Screen/Keyboard
setting and then press the trackwheel.
34
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

The Screen/Keyboard screen appears with various customizable fields,
as shown in Figure 2-4.
3. Select the Font Family field and press the trackwheel.
You’re prompted with a drop-down list. From here, you can select one of
the listed fonts. You’ll find there are anywhere from three to ten fonts for
you to choose from, depending on the model you have.
4. Continuing down the Screen/Keyboard screen, select the Font Size
field and press the trackwheel.
This activates the Font Size drop-down menu. Scroll to the font size of
your choice. One thing to keep in mind is that the smaller the font size,
the more you can see onscreen; however, a smallish font is harder on
the eyes.
Note: As you scroll up and down the list of fonts and font sizes, notice
that the text “The quick brown fox jumps. . . . “ in the background takes
on the look of the selected font and sizes so that you can preview what
the particular text looks like before you confirm your selection.
5. To confirm your changes, press the trackwheel, and then choose Save
from the contextual menu that appears.
Similar to setting Font Size, you can also play with Font Style to set it to Bold,
Italics, or None. At this point, you are probably wondering what Antialias
Mode is for. Think of antialias as a way your BlackBerry renders the alphabet
characters. With No Antialiasing set, your fonts will have round edges. On the
other hand, with Antialiasing set, you fonts will have sharp edges. The differ-
ence is quite subtle, so you can leave this setting if you choose to.

Chapter 2: Turning On Your BlackBerry (And Keeping It Happy)

With fonts out of the way, it’s time to change the brightness of your screen as
well as a couple of other viewing options.
We will next go over how to adjust the backlight on your BlackBerry. What is
backlight you ask? Well, it is simply the light that enables you to see your
screen better. As you will see, you can adjust backlight brightness (how
bright it is when it is on), as well as how long the backlight stays on after
you’ve struck your last key. (Please note that not all BlackBerry models allow
you to set the backlight brightness.)
1. Highlight Options (Settings) from the BlackBerry Home screen and
press the trackwheel.
2. Scroll through the list of options until you find the Screen/Keyboard
setting and then press the trackwheel.
The Screen/Keyboard screen appears with its various customizable
fields. (Refer to Figure 2-4.)
3. Select the Backlight Brightness field and then press the trackwheel.
You’re prompted with a drop-down list. Use your trackwheel and scroll
to select the desired brightness. You can choose anywhere from 0–100
for this option, where 0 is the darkest and 100 is the brightest.
4. Select the Backlight Timeout field and then press the trackwheel.
You’re prompted with a drop-down list. You can select from ten seconds
up to two minutes for backlight timeout.
Backlighting helps you see better on a BlackBerry color screen, but it
also eats away at your battery. Keeping this setting low helps you cut
down on unnecessary battery use. Admittedly, the lower this setting is,
the less time you’ll have backlighting (after you press each key), but a
low setting helps you conserve battery life.
5. Select the Key Tone field and press the trackwheel.
If you’d like a tone to sound every time you press a key, enable the Key
Tone field to On.
Some users like to have Key Tone turned on to confirm their struck keys.
6. Select the Key Rate field and press the trackwheel. Select Slow,
Normal, or Fast.
Key Rate determines how fast BlackBerry responds to your keystrokes.
You can set the Key Rate field based on how fast you type on your
BlackBerry. For example, if you are a fast typer but the Key Rate field is
set to Slow, then you might feel that your BlackBerry is responding quite
slowly to you.
7. To confirm your changes, press the trackwheel and then choose Save
from the contextual menu that appears.

Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

Choosing Themes for your BlackBerry
If you have the 7100 series, your BlackBerry is preloaded with two different
Themes — Default (List) and Service Provider. Basically, your choices are
going to be the Default (List) theme or the theme put together by your ser-
vice provider — T-Mobile, for example.
If you don’t have a 7100 series, your BlackBerry still has the capability to
download themes. We will point you to a couple of sites that you can down-
load themes from.
Regardless of what BlackBerry model you have, to change your theme, follow
these steps:
1. Highlight Options (Settings) from the BlackBerry Home screen and
press the trackwheel.
2. Scroll through the list of options until you find the Theme setting and
then press the trackwheel.
You see a list of available Themes here.
3. Scroll to the Theme you want and press the trackwheel.
4. Choose Activate from the contextual menu that appears.
You should be able to see the change immediately.
Just to give you a sense of what’s involved here, Figure 2-5 shows you how
two different themes affect the Home screen of a 7100t model. The screen on
the left is service provider specific (T-Mobile), whereas the screen on the
right shows the default.

If you don’t have a 7100 series model, you can still change your Theme.
Although your BlackBerry might not be preloaded with themes, have no wor-
ries: You can always download other themes here — just remember that you
have to use your BlackBerry to access these URLs, not your PC:

Wallpaper for your BlackBerry
Like your desktop PC, you can customize your BlackBerry to have personalized
wallpaper for your Home screen. You can set an image to be your BlackBerry
Home screen background by using the BlackBerry Pictures application.
1. From the Home screen, scroll to Pictures application and press the
trackwheel once.
This opens the Pictures application, where you can see some preloaded
images that come with your BlackBerry.
2. Using the trackwheel, scroll to the image you want as your BlackBerry
wallpaper and press the trackwheel once to bring up the Picture menu.
Doing so shows the Picture menu where you can see the option Set As
Home Screen Image.
3. From Picture menu, scroll to Set As Home Screen Image and press the
trackwheel once.
This sets the picture of your choice as the Home screen background.
4. Exit the Pictures application to see your new wallpaper.
You can download free wallpaper here — as long as you use your BlackBerry
to access the URLs and not your PC:
 http://mobile.blackberry.com
 www.blackberrywallpapers.com
 www.blackberrygoodies.com/bb/wallpapers
After you have your BlackBerry’s look and feel just the way you want, there’s
just one thing left to do before you can move on: getting your BlackBerry to
sound the way you want it to.

Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

Let freedom ring
The whole appeal of the BlackBerry phenomenon is the idea that this little
electronic device can make your life easier. One of the ways it accomplishes
this is by acting as your personal reminder service — letting you know when
an appointment is coming up, a phone call is coming in, an e-mail has arrived,
and so on. Basically, your BlackBerry is set to bark at you if it feels there’s
something it knows that you should know about. Figure 2-6 lists the kinds of
things your BlackBerry considers bark-worthy, ranging from browser alerts
to Tasks deadlines.
Different people react differently to different sounds. Some BlackBerry barks
would be greatly appreciated by certain segments of the population, whereas
other segments might react to the same sound by pitching their BlackBerry
under the nearest bus. The folks at Research In Motion are well aware of this
fact and have devised a great way for you to customize how you want your
BlackBerry to bark at you — they call it your Profile.
You can jump right into things by using a predefined Profile, or you can
create your own Profile. The upcoming sections take a look at both
approaches.
Whether you create your own or customize a predefined Profile, each Profile
is divided into seven categories. Each category is really just the application
that you can define how it can alert you. The following is the list of applica-
tions that you can define within each Profile on how they alert you:
 Browser: Will alert you when you receive a new channel push, which is
just a Web page sent to your BlackBerry.
 Calendar: Will alert you when you have upcoming appointments.
Figure 2-6:

Chapter 2: Turning On Your BlackBerry (And Keeping It Happy)

 Level1 Messages (urgent e-mail messages): Will alert you with a special
tone when you have an urgent e-mail. What’s considered an urgent mes-
sage? E-mail can be defined as urgent by your sender. Also, a BlackBerry
PIN-to-PIN message can be considered urgent. For more on PIN-to-PIN,
please see Chapter 8.
 Messages: Will alert you when there is a new e-mail message in your
inbox.
 Phone: Will alert you if there is an incoming call or a new voice mail.
 SMS: Will alert you when you have an SMS message.
 Tasks: Will alert you of an upcoming to-do deadline.
You can personalize all the listed applications depending on how you want 
to be alerted. Because the way you customize them is similar, we use the
Messages application as an example in the text that follows, as we customize
a predefined Profile that comes with your BlackBerry.
After this, we go over creating a new Profile from scratch. You might be won-
dering: Why do I need to create a new Profile if I can personalize the prede-
fined Profiles? Well, for those of you who like to keep the predefined settings
the way they are and want to heavily personalize your Profile, creating a new
Profile is the way to go.
Using factory settings
If you’re okay with customizing a predefined, factory-loaded Profile, just do
the following:
1. Highlight the Profiles application from the BlackBerry Home screen
and then press the trackwheel.
2. Scroll to the Default profile in the list, press the trackwheel highlight
Edit from the contextual menu, and then press the trackwheel again.
The Default screen appears, listing the seven applications with alert
capabilities that we mention in the preceding section. (Refer to Figure
2-6.)
3. In the Default screen, start by highlighting the Messages application,
select Edit from the contextual menu, and then press the trackwheel.
You’re faced with the Messages in Default screen, which is divided into
an Out of Holster section and an In Holster section, as shown in Figure
2-7. A holster (in this context) is simply the belt-clip or case that RIM
gave you to house your BlackBerry while you’re not using it. BlackBerry
is smart enough to know when it is in its holster.
40
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

4. Highlight the Out of Holster field, choose Change Option from the
contextual menu that appears, and then press the trackwheel.
You’re prompted with a drop-down list, spelling out your alert options.
5. Choose Tone from the drop-down list.
Doing so enables sound in the Out of Holster mode.
6. Highlight the Tune field in the Messages in Default screen, choose
Change Option from the contextual menu, and then press the track-
wheel.
You’re prompted with a set of tunes in a drop-down list.
Note: You’re not going to find “Stairway to Heaven” here, but you should
be able to find something you like. If you can’t find one you like, you can
always download ring tones and use them. See the section on download-
ing ring tones for more information.
7. Scroll down to select the tune you’d like.
As you scroll through the tunes and pause, BlackBerry plays the tune so
you know what it sounds like before you change it.
8. To confirm your changes, press the trackwheel, and then choose Save
from the contextual menu that appears.
As you might have guessed from how the Messages in Default screen is
divided, your BlackBerry can notify you in different ways based on
whether your BlackBerry is in plain view (Out of Holster) or tucked
away next to your belt (In Holster). To set up a different sound for In
Holster mode, just put the necessary info in the fields for the In Holster
section — and be sure to pick a different tune this time. (Picking the
same tune kind of defeats the purpose, doesn’t it?)
Figure 2-7:

41
Chapter 2: Turning On Your BlackBerry (And Keeping It Happy)

As we mention before, you can do the same to personalize other applications
listed in each Profile.
If you’re like us and you get more than 200 e-mails a day, you probably don’t
want your BlackBerry sounding off 200 times a day. What you can do is set up
your BlackBerry so that it notifies you only if an e-mail has been marked as
urgent, requiring your immediate attention. You can do this by setting the
notification for your Messages application to None for both In Holster and
Out of Holster. Then, in the Level1 Messages option (refer to Figure 2-6), you
can set your desired notification for both In Holster and Out of Holster. That
way, you have conveniently filtered out any unnecessary e-mail notifications,
leaving just the urgent stuff to sound off to you.
Creating your own Profile
You need to know which applications on your BlackBerry have alert capabili-
ties because you can then personalize each “Hey, you!” to your liking. You can
have your BlackBerry so personalized that you can tell whether you’ve got a
phone call or an incoming message just by how your BlackBerry sounds.
If you’re already familiar with the different applications and are clear how
you want each one to alert you, go on and create your own Profile. As we
mentioned before, you can achieve the same result by personalizing the pre-
defined Profiles that come with your BlackBerry. But if you are one of those
who like to keep the predefined Profiles the way they are, then go ahead and
create a new Profile.
1. Highlight Profiles from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
2. Press the trackwheel, highlight New from the contextual menu, and
then press the trackwheel once more, as shown in Figure 2-8.
Figure 2-8:
A menu
showing
you that you

your own

42
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

A new Profiles screen appears, prompting you to name your profile.
3. Enter a name for your Profile in the Name field.
For this example, just type in My Profile.
4. Configure your new Profile.
Refer to Steps 3 and 4 of the “Using factory settings” section to cus-
tomize each one of the seven applications.
5. Press the trackwheel and then choose Save from the contextual menu
that appears.
Your newly created Profile appears listed in the Profiles screen.
6. In the Profiles screen, scroll to My Profile, press the trackwheel, and
then select Enable from the contextual menu that appears, as shown
in Figure 2-9.
Doing so allows you to start using your newly created profile.
Regardless whether the ring tone is for an incoming call or an incoming
e-mail, you can download more ring tones to personalize your BlackBerry.
You can download free ring tones here — just be sure to call up this URL with
your BlackBerry and not your PC: mobile.blackberry.com.
Navigating Around
In this section, we show you the basic key commands for navigating around
your BlackBerry using both the trackwheel and the QWERTY keyboard.

(Those of you out there with a 7100 get to use the trackwheel and the
SureType keyboard.) Because the keyboard is different in 7100 series than in
other models, Table 2-1 shows you two sets of basic key commands.

SureType versus multitap
On the 7100 series, you can type text in two ways: SureType and multitap. The
regular way — at least we think of it as the regular way — is the multitap
44
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

approach. The best way to explain multitap is by example: Say you want to
type an h character on the 7100. You search out the h on your keyboard but
then notice to your dismay that the h shares a key with the letter g. What’s a
person to do? Do you really want to go through life writing GHello for Hello?
Actually, there’s a perfectly easy solution to your problem. To get the letter g,
you tap the GH key once. To get the letter h — the second letter in the key’s
pair — you tap the key twice — hence, the term multitap.
What about SureType? When you are in SureType mode, your BlackBerry
tries to help you do the communication thing by figuring out what word you
are typing. For example, if you want to type in the word hi, you start by
pressing by GH key and then the UI key. Doing so prompts SureType to dis-
play a list of words it thinks might be what you’re aiming for, as shown in
Figure 2-10. If the first listed word is what you want, simply press the SPACE
key. The word is automatically selected, and you can continue to type. If what
you really wanted to type appears a little later in the list, simply select it
using the trackwheel. Over time, SureType learns the words you’re most
likely to use and sticks those at the front of the list. Yup, that’s right — it 
gets smarter the more you use it.
Here are tips to speed up the learning curve on using SureType technology:
 Always finish typing a word before correcting it. This way, SureType
learns what you want to type next time.
 If SureType got the word you’re typing right on the first try, simply
use the Space key to move on instead of clicking the trackwheel or
pressing ENTER.
 Type! Type! Type! Because SureType learns how you type, the more
you use it, the more adept it becomes at adapting to your style.
Figure 2-10:
Now, did
you want 
to type 
hi or gi?
45
Chapter 2: Turning On Your BlackBerry (And Keeping It Happy)

One final tip takes some explaining. As you’d expect, SureType keeps all the
words it’s learned in a safe place — a Wordlist, to be precise. It turns out that
you can review your SureType Wordlist — and even add to it — using the
Custom Wordlist option. (Using this option to add words or proper names to
the list means that SureType doesn’t have to learn them when you are in the
act of typing.)
To see/add words using the Custom Wordlist option
1. Highlight Options (Settings) from the BlackBerry Home screen and
press the trackwheel.
2. Scroll through the list of options until you find the Custom Wordlist
setting and then press the trackwheel.
This opens up Custom Wordlist. This is where you can see all the words
that SureType has learned. (If just got your BlackBerry recently, there
might be only a few words or even no words in this list, depending how
often you’ve used SureType mode to type.)
3. From within the Custom Wordlist, you add a new word by pressing
the trackwheel and then selecting New from the menu that appears.
Doing so brings up a dialog box prompting you to type in a new word, as
shown in Figure 2-11.
4. To save your changes, press the trackwheel once and select Save from
the menu that appears.
Getting people’s names right is one of those things that is tough with
SureType, but thankfully, you can make sure all the names in your address
book are automatically learned by SureType by doing the following:
Figure 2-11:

Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

1. Highlight Options (Settings) from the BlackBerry Home screen and
press the trackwheel.
2. Scroll through the list of options in the menu that appears until you
find the Language setting and then press the trackwheel.
You now see the Language option screen, where the handy Input
Options button makes its home.
3. Scroll to the Input Options button and press the trackwheel once.
This brings up Fast Options screen with the following options:
• Frequency Learning: If turned on, the word used most frequently
will appear first in the SureType word list while you type. (Refer
back to Figure 2-10 to see what we mean.)
• Auto Word Learning: If turned on, SureType will learn as you type.
• Use Address Book as Data Source: If turned on, SureType will learn
all the names in your address book.
By default, all the options in this screen are turned on.
4. Make sure the Use Address Book as Data Source option is turned on. If
not, scroll to this field, press the trackwheel, select Change Option
from the context menu, and then select On from the drop-down menu.
5. To save your changes, press the trackwheel once and select Save from
the context menu.
General Keyboard Shortcuts
In many instances within this book, when we ask you to go to a BlackBerry
application (Profile, for example), you have to first scroll to it from the Home
screen and then click the trackwheel. You might be thinking “Hey, there must
be shortcuts for this,” and you’d be right. This section covers such general
keyboard shortcuts, all in the name of making your life easier. (Shortcuts that
are a bit more application-specific get covered in the chapters dealing with a
particular application.)
Before you get all excited about doing shortcuts, there’s one bit of house-
keeping you need to take care of. In order for you to use some of these gen-
eral keyboard shortcuts, you first have to make sure that the Dial From Home
Screen setting — buried deep within the Phone application — is turned off.
Enquiring minds want to know, so we’ll tell you. The Dial From Home Screen
option is designed for heavy phone users who frequently make BlackBerry
47
Chapter 2: Turning On Your BlackBerry (And Keeping It Happy)

phone calls. If you are not a frequent phone user and would like to access all
applications with a press of a button, get ready to ditch Dial From Home
Screen. (Keep in mind that 7100 uses don’t need to mess with their Dial From
Home Screen settings, since their shortcuts work differently. 7100 users can
always dial from their home screens.)
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, highlight the Phone application
and then press the trackwheel.
2. Press the trackwheel to bring up the contextual menu, highlight
Options, and then press the trackwheel once more.
A screen listing a range of different options appears.
3. Highlight General Options from the list and press the trackwheel.
The General Options screen appears.
4. Scroll to the Dial From Home Screen field, press the trackwheel to
bring up the contextual menu, and then highlight Change Option, as
shown in Figure 2-12.
You see a drop-down menu with a rather limited set of choices — Yes
and No, to be exact.
5. Choose No from the drop-down menu.
Doing so shuts down the Dial From Home Screen option, enabling you to
use Home screen shortcuts.
6. To confirm your changes, press the trackwheel and then choose Save
from the contextual menu that appears.
If you’re a frequent phone user on your BlackBerry, as opposed to an e-mail
or Internet user, you might not want to turn the Dial From Home Screen fea-
ture off.

Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

Using Home screen shortcuts
After you disable the Dial From Home Screen feature (see the previous sec-
tion), you are free to use any and all Home screen shortcuts. (The name for
these shortcuts is actually a pretty good fit because you can use these short-
cuts only while you are at the Home screen.)
All the Home screen shortcuts described within this section work on the
majority of BlackBerry models — with the notable exception of the
BlackBerry 7100 series.
Okay, here goes. To call up the application listed in the first column of Table
2-2, press the key listed in the table’s second column.

Other (non-Home screen) shortcuts
The following shortcuts can be used at any time, regardless of which screen
you’re currently in — or whether you have Dial From Home Screen enabled,
for that matter:
 Quick menu: This keyboard shortcut (ALT+ESCAPE) is similar to the
Alt+Tab keyboard combination on Windows PCs. It’s great when you
want to quickly switch between applications, either to look up informa-
tion or to check on something else while waiting for an event to occur
(your browser to load, for example). Figure 2-13 shows you what the
Quick menu looks like onscreen.
 Hide/Show/Move Application Position on the Home Screen: The old
ALT-click trackwheel combination calls up the menu for hiding/show-
ing/moving an application icon. (See Figure 2-14.) This is great for those
times when you want to tidy up your Home screen by removing some
little-used icons or when you just want to rearrange the icon order.
 Device Reset (also known as the 3-Button Salute): Pressing
ALT+CAP+DEL forces a manual reset, which is just what you need when
your BlackBerry has crashed or when you install an application and it
needs a manual reset. You can achieve the same result by pulling out the
battery from the back of the BlackBerry.
 HelpME: In the BlackBerry world, SOS is actually spelled ALT+CAP+H.
Use it when you’re on the phone with technical support. (It gives them
things like your BlackBerry PIN, memory space, and BlackBerry version
number so they have information about your BlackBerry when they try
to troubleshoot your problems.) 
Note: BlackBerry PIN isn’t a security password; rather, it is a unique
number that identifies your BlackBerry, sort of like a serial number. But
unlike a serial number, you can message another BlackBerry using PIN-
to-PIN messages. For more on PIN-to-PIN messages, please see Chapter 8.

Power Usage and Consumption
Your BlackBerry comes equipped with a rechargeable, replaceable lithium 
battery that can have stand-by time (time when your BlackBerry is on but not
being used) that lasts from three to seven days, depending on your BlackBerry
model. As you would expect, a color screen BlackBerry consumes more bat-
tery than a non-color screen BlackBerry. (Color screens are big consumers of
battery juice.) Also, the more you use the backlight (the light that lets you see
your display screen better) the more quickly your battery is going to run out.
Finally, do keep in mind that your BlackBerry is an Internet-ready device (okay,
okay, we know you know that, because that’s why you got it, right?) and that
anything you can’t do without a network signal (sending and receiving e-mails,
Internet browsing, talking on the phone) eats into your battery reserves in a
big way. Typically, a color BlackBerry lasts around three days with normal use
or five days stand-by time.
Like with any lithium battery, first condition your BlackBerry battery by dis-
charging it (letting your battery drain out) and then recharging. This way, you
can get the most out of your battery.
We briefly mention here how recharging is handled/how best to do it/tips for
charging on the go (charging while in your car?). Then we go into the battery
conservation tips.
Here is a handy list of battery conservation tips to keep your BlackBerry up
and running as long as possible while you’re on the go:
 Reduce backlight amount and timeout. Using the Screen/Keyboard
option, adjust your backlight to a low setting. With the exception of the
7100 models, BlackBerry screens are usually quite legible while out-
doors or in a well-lit environment. In addition, set the backlight timeout
as low as possible. (You can get the details in setting Screen/Keyboard
option in the “Customizing your screen’s look and feel” section, earlier
in this chapter.)
Figure 2-14:
The Hide
menu.
51
Chapter 2: Turning On Your BlackBerry (And Keeping It Happy)

 Don’t use what you don’t need. Turn off any wireless capabilities if
you’re in an area where you’re out of coverage (for example, under-
ground or on an airplane) so that your BlackBerry doesn’t waste its bat-
tery searching for radio signals. (For all the details on dealing with
wireless features, see Chapters 7–10.)
Similarly, if your BlackBerry has Bluetooth capability, turn it off during
those times when you have no use for it.
 Bulk up your power. If you are a heavy phone user or are on the go all
the time, consider purchasing an extra extended battery or a car power
kit. See Chapter 16 where we suggest to you where to purchase one.
Keeping Your BlackBerry Safe
The folks at Research In Motion take security very seriously, and so should
you. Always set up a password on your BlackBerry. If your BlackBerry hasn’t
prompted you to set up a password, you should immediately do so. Here’s
how it’s done:
1. Highlight Options (Settings) from the BlackBerry Home screen and
press the trackwheel.
2. Scroll through the list of options until you find the Security option
and then press the trackwheel.
The Security screen appears, as shown in Figure 2-15.
3. Highlight the Password field, press the trackwheel to bring up the
contextual menu, and then choose Change Option.
Figure 2-15:
Keeping
things
secure with
the Security
screen.
52
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

You’re faced with drop-down menu offering two options: Enabled or
Disabled.
4. Select Enabled from the drop-down menu and then press the track-
wheel.
All this does for now is enable the Password feature. You won’t actually
be prompted to type a password until you save the changes you just
made.
5. To confirm your changes, press the trackwheel and then choose Save
from the contextual menu that appears.
At this time, you should be prompted for a password, as shown in 
Figure 2-16.
6. Type in a password and then type it again for verification.
From this point on, whenever you lock your BlackBerry and want to use
it again, you only have to type the same password. How to lock your
BlackBerry? Good question, keep reading.
Remember that when you set your password on a 7100 series, please make
sure you know what letter your password is and not just which key you
press. You will need the same password if you link your BlackBerry with 
the BlackBerry Desktop Manager for synchronization purposes. For more 
on BlackBerry Desktop Manager, please refer to Chapters 11–14. Keep in
mind as well that, with the 7100 series, all passwords must be entered in mul-
titap mode.
Setting up your password is a good first step, but just having a password won’t
help you much if you don’t take the further step of locking your BlackBerry
when you are not using it. (You don’t want people at the office or sitting at the
next table at the coffee shop checking out your e-mails or phone history when
you take a bathroom break, do you?) So, how do you lock your BlackBerry? Let
us count the ways . . . and we came up with two, in fact.
Figure 2-16:

53
Chapter 2: Turning On Your BlackBerry (And Keeping It Happy)

You can go the Autolock After Timeout (also known as Security Timeout)
route:
1. Highlight Options (Settings) from the BlackBerry Home screen and
press the trackwheel.
2. Scroll through the list of options until you find the Security option
and then press the trackwheel.
The Security screen displays.
3. Highlight the Security Timeout field, press the trackwheel to bring up
the contextual menu, and then choose Change Option.
A drop-down menu appears, listing preset times ranging from 1 minute
to 1 hour.
4. From the drop-down, select 20 minutes and press the trackwheel.
This seems high to me — you can read a lot of e-mail in 20 minutes
5. To confirm your changes, press the trackwheel and then choose Save
from the contextual menu that appears.
If you’re more the hands-on kind of person, you can go the Manual Lockout
route by scrolling to the Keyboard Lock icon on your Home screen and press-
ing the trackwheel. (Pressing K while at the Home screen does the same
thing.)
To lock a 7100 model, just press the asterisk (*) key.
No matter what route you take to lock your Blackberry, you use your (newly
created) password to unlock it when you get back from wherever you’ve
been.
Who Ya Gonna Call (When 
Your BlackBerry Breaks)?
Certainly not those Ghostbusters guys. We do suggest that you contact your
network service provider first. (Remember them? They’re the guys who sold
you the device in the first place.)
You can’t buy direct from RIM? Is that true? Before you start calling anyone,
you should know that your BlackBerry device, holster, and cradle (if it came
with one) are under a one-year warranty from either RIM itself or your service
54
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

provider. Within the first year, RIM or your service provider will replace or
repair your BlackBerry if any defect is found. Do keep in mind, though, that
your warranty does not cover any damage to your BlackBerry caused by
either an accident or misuse.
With that out of the way, if your BlackBerry is still under the one-year war-
ranty and it somehow isn’t functioning properly, give your service provider 
a ring. (Table 2-3 lists the customer service numbers of the major U.S. and
Canadian service providers.)
Table 2-3

If you are out of warranty, you can have your BlackBerry repaired or replaced
for a fee. The best bet is still to contact your network service provider to find
out how much it would cost you to repair it, and if you have other options.

function as any address book: an organizational tool that gives you a place to
record information about people. This tool gives you a central place from
which you can retrieve information so that you can reach your contacts via
many ways: phone, cellphone, e-mail, snail-mail. Depending on the type of
work you do, an address book is likely an essential tool, and your BlackBerry
is there at the ready.
If any of the following fit you and your lifestyle, you can benefit from using
your BlackBerry Address Book:
 Do you travel?
 Do you meet clients frequently?
 Do you spend a lot of time on the phone?
 Have you asked somebody for his phone number or e-mail address more
than once?
 Do you carry around the old-fashioned, paper day-planner with a section
allocated for recording contacts? Or do you write phone numbers of
acquaintances on the back of business cards?
 Is your wallet or purse full of these “important” business cards, but you
can never seem to find the ones you need when you need them?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, you need an address book.
Regardless of how you keep your contact information, if you already own a
BlackBerry, get down to business and organize your contacts using your
BlackBerry. In this chapter, we show you how to make your BlackBerry a
handy, timesaving tool for managing your contacts’ information. Specifically,
you find out how to add, change, and delete contacts as well as how to locate
them later. You’ll also be amazed at how well the Address Book is integrated
with all the other BlackBerry features you’ve come to know and love — phon-
ing contacts, adding invites to your meetings, adding contacts to BlackBerry
Messenger, and composing e-mails.
If you’re one of those um, stubborn, folks who insist that they don’t need an
address book — “I’m doing just fine without one, thank you very much!” —
think of it this way. You’ve been using a virtual address book all the time —
the one buried inside your cellphone. And that address book often isn’t even
a very good one! When you’re ready to join the rest of us in this millennium,
read this chapter to see how to transfer all that good contact info from an old
phone into your new (BlackBerry-based) Address Book.
Accessing Your Address Book
The good people at Research In Motion make it easy for you to distinguish
the Address Book. Start by taking a look at the BlackBerry Home screen. The
Address Book icon looks like an old-fashioned Rolodex. (Remember those?)
By default, the Address Book icon is located next to the Phone icon. If you
have a hard time locating it, Figure 3-1 shows what it looks like in both
BlackBerry incarnations. (For more about the BlackBerry models and their
differences, check out Chapter 15.) To describe the Address Book in this
chapter and for most of the illustrations throughout this book, we use the
7100t model.
Opening the Address Book couldn’t be more simple:
1. Highligh its icon (by using the trackwheel).
2. Click the trackwheel.
Alternatively, you can press Enter.
The trackwheel is also used to display menus inside the application.

Chapter 3: Remembering Your Acquaintances

Your BlackBerry Address Book is also accessible from a number of different
applications, including Phone, Messages, and Calendar. For example, say
you’re in Calendar and you want to invite people to one of your meetings or
appointments. Look no further — Address Book is in the menu, ready to lend
a helping hand. The same is true for Phone and Messages.
You can also get to the Address Book by pressing A while at the Home screen.
Go to Chapter 2 for more on Home screen shortcuts.
Working with Address Book Names
Getting a new gizmo is always exciting because you just know that your
newest toy is chockfull of features you’re dying to try out. Imagine having a
new BlackBerry, for example. The first thing you’ll want to do is try to call or
e-mail someone, right? (Older devices that have three-digit model numbers
are data-only devices and can’t be used for phoning.) But wait a sec — you
don’t have any contact information yet, which means you’re going to have to
type in someone’s e-mail address each time you send an e-mail — a hassle if
there ever were one.
Time to get with the plan. Most of us humans — social creatures that we are —
maintain a list of contacts somewhere, whether in an e-mail program like
Outlook or Lotus Notes, in an old cellphone, or maybe on a piece of paper kept
tucked away in a wallet. We’re pretty sure you have some kind of list some-
where. So the trick is getting that list into your BlackBerry device so that you
can access the info more efficiently. The good news for you is that the “getting
contact info into your BlackBerry device” trick isn’t a hard one to master. Stick
with us, and you’ll have it down pat by the end of this chapter.
Often the simplest way to get contact information into your BlackBerry is to
enter it manually. However, if you’ve invested a lot of time and energy in
maintaining some type of address book application on your desktop com-
puter, you might want to hot sync that data into your BlackBerry. (For more
on synchronizing data, you can check Chapter 12. It gives you details on 
how to synchronize some of your desktop application data — the address
book, e-mail, appointments and memos stuff.) You can also transfer your 
old cellphone contacts into your BlackBerry. Intrigued? Then check out the
“Transferring Contacts from Cellphones” section, later in this chapter. Do you
have an Address Book in another PDA, such as a Palm Pilot or a PocketPC?
No problem. Most of these devices allow you to sync to a desktop computer
application such as Outlook. But this is not a book about other PDAs, so
please refer to your other device’s instructions on how to sync it to your
desktop. After the data is in the desktop, you can check Chapter 12 for details
on synchronizing it to your BlackBerry.

Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Creating a new contact
Imagine you’ve just run into Jane Doe, an old high school friend you haven’t
seen in years. Jane is about to give you her number, but you don’t have a pen
or pencil handy to write her information down. Are you then forced to chant
her phone number to yourself until you can scare up a writing implement?
Not if you have your handy BlackBerry device on you. With BlackBerry in
hand, follow these steps to create a new contact:
1. Using the trackwheel, scroll to highlight the Address Book application
on the BlackBerry Home screen and then press the trackwheel.
The Address Book opens. You can also access the Address Book from
different applications. Check Chapter 14 for using the Address Book to
invite people to an appointment and check Chapter 7 on how to access
the Address Book from Messages.
2. Press the trackwheel, scroll, and click to choose New Address from
the menu that appears.
The New Address screen appears, as shown in Figure 3-2.
3. Scroll through the various fields, stopping and entering the contact
information you feel is appropriate.
You’ll use your BlackBerry keyboard to enter this information, but most
BlackBerry keyboards look (and work) alike. For an overview of the dif-
ferent keyboard types, see Chapter 1.
We don’t think you can overdo it when entering a person’s contact infor-
mation. You should strive to enter complete information or as much as
you possibly can. Maybe the benefit won’t be obvious now, but in the
Figure 3-2:
Create a
new contact
here.
63
Chapter 3: Remembering Your Acquaintances

future when your memory fails you or your boss needs a critical piece of
info that you just so happen to have at the ready, you’ll thank us for this
advice.
Hint: To create another new blank e-mail field for the same contact,
press the trackwheel and select Add Email Address from the menu that
appears. You can have up to three e-mail addresses per contact.
Bonus hint: When entering an e-mail address, press the SPACE key to
insert an @ symbol or a period (.).
If a contact has an extension for her phone number, no problem. When
calling such a contact from your BlackBerry, you can instruct BlackBerry
to dial the extension after the initial phone number. When entering the
phone number into the New Address or Enter Address screen, type in
the primary phone number, press the trackwheel, choose Add Pause
from the menu that appears, and then add the extension number. (If you
have sharp eyes, note the Add Wait menu option, which is a variation on
the easy way to dial phone extensions feature. Adding a pause tells your
BlackBerry to dial the extension number for you — after a two-second
delay — whenever you want it to. Adding a wait lets your BlackBerry
know that it’s time to call up the Extension Dialog screen, which
prompts you to enter the extension number.)
4. When you finish entering the contact information you want, press the
trackwheel, scroll, and click Save.
At this point, you should see your Jane Doe added to the list, as shown
in Figure 3-3.
Taking Notes
The Notes field in the New Address — you might need to scroll down a bit to
see it — is quite useful for adding a unique description about your contact.
Figure 3-3:

Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

For example, jog or refresh your memory with tidbits such as, knows some-
body at ABC Corporation or can provide introduction to a Broadway agent. Or
perhaps your note is something personal, such as likes golf; has 2 children,
boy - 7 & girl - 3; husband’s name is Ray. It’s really up to you: Again, the more
useful the information, the better it will serve you.
Adding your own fields
Perhaps your contact information really doesn’t fit into any of the available
fields. Although you can’t really create any additional fields from scratch, you
can commandeer one of the User fields for your own purposes.
The User fields are located at the bottom of the screen — you have to scroll
down to see them. Basically, the User fields are fair game — you can use
these fields any way you want (which is great), and you can even change the
field’s name. (Face it, User field is not that helpful as a descriptive title.) For
example, you could rename User fields to capture suffixes (such as MD, PhD,
and so on). Or how about profession, birth date, hobbies, school, or nick-
name? When it comes down to it, you decide what information is important
to you.
To rename a User field
1. Use the trackwheel to scroll to the bottom of the screen to navigate to
one of the User fields.
2. Press the trackwheel and choose Change Field Name from the menu.
Note: The Change Field Name selection on the menu appears only if the
cursor is in a User field.
3. Enter the new User field name via your keyboard.
4. Press the trackwheel or Enter key to save.
You’re all set. Keep in mind, though, that changing the field name for this
particular contact changes it for all your contacts.
Adding contacts from other 
BlackBerry applications
When you receive an e-mail message or get a call from someone, you’ve got
yourself some contact information in Messages or Phone. (RIM makes this
easy for you because Messages and Phone can recognize phone numbers or
e-mail addresses and then highlight that information for a quick cut and
paste.) Maybe that info isn’t complete, but you definitely have at least an
65
Chapter 3: Remembering Your Acquaintances

e-mail address or phone number. Now, if you’re pretty sure you’ll be corre-
sponding with this person and he isn’t yet listed in your Address Book, it’s
just logical that you’d want the information added to your BlackBerry
Address Book.
If you have a sharp eye, you might noticed that Phone lists only outgoing
numbers. That’s half of what you need. Oddly enough, you can access the his-
tory of incoming phone calls inside Messages. In Messages, press the track-
wheel and click View Folder on the menu that appears. Scroll and click Phone
Call Logs.
Like e-mail, a call log entry stays in the list as long as you have free space in
your BlackBerry. This could mean months or years depending on your model
and usage. When BlackBerry runs out of space, it starts reclaiming space a
chunk at a time by deleting read e-mails and phone call logs, starting from the
oldest.
When you have an e-mail or phone log opened, just scroll to an e-mail
address or phone number and press the trackwheel while that piece of infor-
mation is highlighted. An Add to Address Book option pops up on the menu.
(This particular menu item is located at the bottom of the list, so you might
have to scroll to see it.) Choose Add to Address Book, and a new New
Address screen appears, pre-filled with that particular piece of information.
All you need to do now is enter the rest of the information you know about
the person, and it’s ready to be saved into the Address Book. It’s one more
sign of BlackBerry’s ongoing attempt to make your life easier.
Viewing a contact
Okay, you just entered your friend’s name Jane into your BlackBerry, but you
have this nagging thought in the back of your mind that you typed the wrong
phone number. You want to quickly view Jane’s information. Here’s how you
do it:
1. Highlight the Address Book application from the BlackBerry Home
screen and press the trackwheel.
The Address Book opens.
2. Scroll and highlight the contact name you want and press ENTER.
Pressing Enter while a name is highlighted is the same as opening the
menu and choosing View — just quicker.
View mode displays only information that’s been filled in, as shown in
Figure 3-4. (It doesn’t bother showing fields where you haven’t entered
anything.)
66
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Editing a contact
Change is an inevitable part of life. Given that fact, your contact information
is sure to change as well. If you want to keep the information you diligently
put in your Address Book current, you’re going to have to do some updating
now and then.
To update a contact, follow these steps:
1. Highlight Address Book from the BlackBerry Home screen and press
the trackwheel.
The Address Book opens.
2. Scroll and highlight a contact name; then choose Edit from the menu.
The Edit Address screen for the contact name you selected makes an
appearance.
In Address Book (or any BlackBerry application, for that matter), dis-
playing a menu involves just a simple press of the trackwheel. You see
the Edit option on the menu right below View.
3. Scroll through the various fields of the Edit Address screen, editing
the contact information as you see fit.
If you want to replace only a few words or letters located in the middle
of a field (rather than replacing the whole text) scroll the trackwheel
while pressing and holding the Alt key (the one that looks like a half
moon on the 72xx models and an up/down arrow pair on 7100 models)
to position your cursor precisely on the text you want to change. Then
make your desired changes
4. Press the trackwheel and select Save from the menu that appears.
The edit you made for this contact is saved.
Figure 3-4:
View mode

67
Chapter 3: Remembering Your Acquaintances

When you’re editing information and you want to totally replace the entry
with a new one, it is much faster to first clear the contents, especially if the
old data is long. When you are in an editable field (as opposed to selectable
field), just press the trackwheel to display the menu and then choose the
Clear Field option. This feature is available in all text-entry fields and for most
BlackBerry applications.
In OS versions prior to 4.0, a p appeared between the main number and the
extension number (p, of course, standing for pause). RIM replaced the p with
a comma in version 4.0, as shown in Figure 3-5.
Deleting a contact
When it’s time to eradicate somebody’s contact information on your address
book (whether a case of duplication, or a bit of bad blood — yes, we admit to
have occasionally stricken somebody from our Address Books in a fit of
pique), the BlackBerry OS makes it very easy to delete a contact from the
Address Book.
Here’s how:
1. Highlight Address Book from the BlackBerry Home screen and press
the trackwheel.
The Address Book opens.
2. Scroll and highlight a contact name you want to delete; then choose
Delete from the menu that appears.
A Confirmation screen appears, as shown in Figure 3-6.
Comma means pause

extension 333

Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

If you don’t initially see the Delete option, scroll down to the bottom
part of the screen.
3. Highlight Delete on the Confirmation screen and then press the 
trackwheel.
The contact you selected is deleted and disappears from your contact
list.
Sometimes dealing with the Confirmation screen can be a pain if you want to
delete several contacts in a row. If you are 100 percent sure that you want to
ditch a number of contacts, you can suspend the Confirmation feature by set-
ting the Confirm Delete option to No in the Address Book Options screen.
Check the “Setting preferences” section later in this chapter for more on
Address Book options.
Transferring Contacts from Cellphones
Suppose you have an old cellphone that has served you well for many years.
Most likely you’ve accumulated contacts on that phone by painstakingly
typing them each time in the past. You’d really like to have the same contacts
on your BlackBerry as you have on your cellphone, but you just cannot bear
the thought of typing them all again. You think to yourself, “There has to be a
way.” Good news: You’re right, there really is a way.
Copying contacts from a SIM card
We’ve copied contacts from Nokia, Ericsson, Motorola, and Samsung cell-
phones — and in theory, this should also work on other phones. The trick
Figure 3-6:
A confirma-
tion screen
appears
after you
delete a
contact.
69
Chapter 3: Remembering Your Acquaintances

here is using the SIM card as an external storage device — sort of like a
floppy disk. What exactly is a SIM card? The acronym stands for Subscriber
Identity Module. The non-head-scratching definition describes an electronic
chip that is capable of storing information like your phone numbers and
address book. Basically, you store your old phone’s contact list on the SIM
card and then insert that SIM card into your BlackBerry. Then upload the
contacts from your SIM card. (For all the gory details, check out the step list
later in this section.)
This sounds easy to do, yet, it might be tricky depending on the type of
phone you have. First and foremost, you can only do this on a GSM phone.
(GSM is short for Global System for Mobile Communications, probably the
most popular standard for mobile phones in the world.) To tell whether you
have a GSM phone, first check whether you have a SIM card. To do that, take
out the battery of your cellphone. Behind it, you should see a SIM card, look-
ing (we hope) like the one you see in Figure 3-7. (If you don’t see anything like
what you see in Figure 3-7, your phone is not a GSM phone.)
If your cellphone is, in fact, a GSM phone and you’re determined to forge
ahead and transfer your cellphone contact info to your BlackBerry, we’re
here to help. Obviously, we’re not in a position to know precisely what kind
of phone you have — there are just too many types of phones out there, for
one thing. For the purpose of showing you what’s what, we’re going to
assume that you want to transfer the address book on a Nokia 7210 phone to
your BlackBerry. (Why the Nokia 7210? That’s the one the dartboard told us
to use.) We also have instructions for other phones on the Web site associ-
ated with this book, so feel free to get online and check whether your particu-
lar phone is covered there.
No more digressions! If you want to know the steps for copying contacts from
a Nokia phone to a BlackBerry using a SIM card, here they are:
1. Take out the SIM card buried inside your BlackBerry and put it in the
Nokia phone.
Figure 3-7:
Transfer

Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Most people are uncomfortable doing this, but taking out and putting a
SIM card back on a phone is no big deal. The SIM card is usually behind
the battery, so you have to slide or take off the back cover of the phone
to get to it. On the BlackBerry, the back cover has a groove where you
can put your thumb and push the cover out. A Nokia phone has a simple
locking mechanism, a notch that protrudes in the back of the phone,
which you slide so that you can take off the back cover. When the cover
is out, you can remove the battery and you should see the SIM card
behind it. Slide the SIM card’s plastic enclosure; it should pop open. You
can then remove the SIM card from the enclosure.
Because this step requires you to remove the batteries from both your
BlackBerry and your Nokia phone, both devices are gong to power off
(obviously).
We’re going to resuscitate both, starting with the Nokia. After you put
the phone’s battery on the Nokia phone, it resets, and you should see
the display come up.
2. On the Nokia phone, press the top tip of the rightmost top button.
A Phone Book menu appears, as shown in Figure 3-8.
3. Scroll and choose Copy from the menu.
Another menu appears displaying two options: From Phone to SIM Card
and From SIM Card to Phone.
4. Scroll and choose From Phone to SIM Card from the menu.
5. Scroll and choose All from the menu. Choose Keep Original from the
menu that follows.
A confirmation screen appears.
6. Select OK to confirm the copy.
Your phone starts copying the contents of the Phone Book to the SIM
card. While it is doing the copy, the screen displays a bar that moves
back and forth. That’s not much of a progress bar. If you have many

the Copy

Chapter 3: Remembering Your Acquaintances

contacts on your phone, this process can take some time, so just be
patient. When it’s done and contacts are all loaded to the SIM card, the
screen displays the number of contacts it copied. You can proceed with
the next step.
7. Take out the SIM card from the Nokia phone and put it back into your
BlackBerry.
Reinserting the SIM card resets your BlackBerry.
8. Using the trackwheel, scroll to highlight Address Book on the
BlackBerry Home screen and then press the trackwheel.
The Address Book opens.
9. In Address Book, press the trackwheel to show the menu, scroll to
highlight SIM Phone Book, and then press the trackwheel to choose it.
It might take some time to load the contacts from your SIM card; how
long really depends on how many contacts you’ve saved to the card.
While it’s loading, you should see a progress bar on the screen. After all
the contacts are loaded, they are listed onscreen, and you can start
browsing or copying them to your Address Book.
The SIM Phone Book menu item is located towards the bottom of the
menu, as shown in Figure 3-9. Depending on your model, you might need
to scroll down to see it.
10. To copy a contact to the Address Book, just highlight the contact,
press the trackwheel to display the menu, and then choose Add to
Address Book.
Your contact has now found its way to the BlackBerry Address Book.
You can repeat this step for all the contacts you want copied. Although
this is a bit of a tedious process, it’s still a lot better than trying to type
in each one on your BlackBerry.

Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

One thing to keep in mind is that SIM cards do have a rather limited capacity.
If all your contacts don’t fit on the SIM card on your first try, here are two
ways you can add leftover contacts to your BlackBerry:
 One by one: If only one or two contacts are not included, you might be
better off just typing them into your BlackBerry.
 In batches: If you have many more contacts left, you probably should
try doing multiple saves. The trouble here is that you have to figure out
what contact info was saved on your first try — which, of course, lets
you know what you still have to copy over. We recommend loading such
contacts in batches. To do that, first delete the names from the SIM card
after they are loaded on to your BlackBerry. (That gives you a clean
slate.) Repeat Steps 3 and 4 from the preceding list, but when you get to
Step 5, select One by One from the menu instead of All. This allows you
to select the remaining contacts to copy to the SIM card one at a time,
rather than copying the whole shebang one more time. When the
remaining contacts are in the SIM card, you can copy the second batch
of names and load them to your BlackBerry using the preceding steps.
Repeat as needed.
Copying a contact to a SIM card
You can reverse the info-import process, too: that is, copy from your Black-
Berry Address Book to a cellphone. “Can this be done?” you implore. To which
we reply, “Why, certainly, with a little help from two BlackBerry experts.” For,
truth be told, this feature of the Address Book is probably one of the most dif-
ficult tricks to figure out unless somebody shows you how it’s done.
1. Start off by viewing the contact information.
Follow the steps in the “Viewing a contact” section, earlier in the 
chapter.
2. On the view screen, scroll to a Phone Number field, press the track-
wheel, and then choose Copy to SIM Phone Book from the menu that
appears.
The key to displaying this menu is to
• Be in the view screen.
and
• Keep the cursor on a phone number field, as shown in the 
Figure 3-10.
The Copy to SIM Phone Book feature shows up only when you
position the cursor at the phone number field.
73
Chapter 3: Remembering Your Acquaintances

In versions prior to 3.8 of the BlackBerry OS, this step saves the entries
to SIM card right away. However, in version 3.8 or later, a confirmation
screen shows up. It displays the phone book entry you want to add to
the SIM card. If you see this screen, proceed to Step 3 to continue with
the saving.
3. On the Phone Book Entry screen, press the trackwheel, and then
choose Save from the menu that appears.
This operation is a snap, and the screen immediately returns to the view
contact screen shown as a result of Step 1.
If your BlackBerry SIM card isn’t recognized by your phone, perhaps the
phone is locked. Phone providers do this all the time: They lock the phones
to their network, making it unusable in other networks. If this is the case,
please call your phone provider and ask for instructions on how to unlock
your phone.
Copying Contacts from 
Desktop Applications
Most of us have desktop applications that we use to maintain our network —
you know, Microsoft Outlook, IBM Lotus Notes, or Novell GroupWise. A word
to the wise: You do not want to maintain two Address Books — one in your
BlackBerry and one on your desktop computer. That’s a recipe for disaster.

Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Luckily for you, RIM makes it easy to get your various address books —
BlackBerry, desktop, laptop, whatever — in sync. Your BlackBerry comes
with a desktop software called BlackBerry Desktop Manager (BDM). BDM is a
collection of programs, and one of them is the Intellisync. Intellisync allows
you to sync between your device and the PC software. It also allows you to
set up and configure the behavior of the program, including how the fields in
the desktop version of Address Book map to Address Book fields in your
BlackBerry. But you’re not going to read about it here. For that, check out
Chapter 12, which has complete details on how you can use the Intellisync
feature of your BlackBerry Desktop Manager application to synchronize with
the applications in your device — including, of course, your Address Book.
Looking for Someone?
Somehow — usually through a combination of typing skills and the shuttling
of data between various electronic devices — you’ve created a nice long list
of contacts in your Address Book. Nice enough, we suppose, but useless
unless you can find the phone number of Rufus T. Firefly at the drop of a hat.
That’s where the Find screen comes in. In fact, the first thing that you see in
the Address Book when you open it is the Find screen, as shown in Figure 3-11.
You can conveniently search through your contacts by following these steps:
1. In the Find field, enter the starting letters of the name you want to
search for.
Your search criterion(a) is the name of the person. You could enter the
last name or first name or both.
Figure 3-11:
Your search
starts here.
75
Chapter 3: Remembering Your Acquaintances

The list is usually sorted by first name and then last name. As you type
in the letters, notice that the list starts shrinking based on the matches
on the letters that you enter. Figure 3-12 illustrates exactly how this
works.
2. Scroll and highlight the name from the list of matches.
If you have multiple matches, use the trackwheel to scroll through the
list to find the person’s name.
3. Press the trackwheel and choose from the possible actions listed on
the menu that appears.
After you find the person you want, you can choose from these options,
as shown on Figure 3-13:
• Email: Starts a new e-mail message. See Chapter 7 for more infor-
mation about e-mail.
• PIN: Starts a new PIN-to-PIN message, which is a messaging unique
to BlackBerry. With PIN-to-PIN, you can send someone who has a
BlackBerry a quick message. See Chapter 8 for more details about
PIN-to-PIN messaging.
• Call: Uses Phone to dial the number.
• SMS: Starts a new SMS message. SMS is short for Short Messaging
Service, which is used in cellphones. See Chapter 8 for more details
about SMS.
If you have a finger-fumble and press a letter key in error, press the Escape
key once to return to the original list (the one showing all your contacts), or
you can press the trackwheel once and choose View All.

If you think you’re hallucinating when you notice that sometimes the menu
item Email <contact name> or Call <contact name> displays on the
menu and sometimes not, just relax. There’s nothing wrong with your eye-
sight or your mind. Address Book is smart enough to know when it’s appro-
priate to show those menu options. If a contact has a phone number, Call
<contact name> and SMS <contact name> show up, and the same is true
for e-mail and personal identification number (PIN). In fact, this list of actions
is a convenient way to find out if you have particular information — a phone
number or e-mail address — for a particular contact.
If you have a long list in your Address Book and you want to scroll down a
page at a time, just hold down the Alt key and scroll. You’ll get where you
need to go a lot faster.

might disable the PIN-to-PIN messaging because it doesn’t go to the corpo-
rate e-mail servers and, therefore, can’t be monitored. If this is the case, the
menu option PIN<contact name> won’t appear even though you entered
PIN information on your contacts. Note that you’ll still be able to receive a
PIN-to-PIN message, but you won’t be able to send one.
Organizing Your Contacts
You’ve been a diligent boy or girl by adding your contacts to your Address
Book, and your list has been growing at a pretty good clip. It now has all the
contact information for your business colleagues, clients, and (of course)
family, friends, and relatives. In fact, your Address Book has grown so much
that it now holds hundreds of contacts, and you start to notice that it now
Figure 3-13:

options for
the selected
contact.
77
Chapter 3: Remembering Your Acquaintances

takes you more time to find somebody, especially when you can’t remember
the name right away and you’re trying to explore the list knowing that when
you see it, you’ll recognize it.
Imagine that you’ve just seen an old acquaintance, a sales rep for XYZ, Inc.,
and you want to greet the person by his name. His name is on the tip of your
tongue, but you just can’t put your finger on it. However, if you saw his name
on a list, it would jump right out at you. The trouble is that your list has 300-
plus names, which would take you forever to scroll through — so long, in
fact, that person would surely come right up to you in the meantime, and
you’d have to fake the fact that you can’t for the life of you remember his
name. (How embarrassing.) In this scenario, the tried-and-true Find feature
wouldn’t be much help. What you need is a smaller pool of names to search
though so that you stumble across the needed name much more quickly.
You know this isn’t rocket science. You’re going to want to
 Organize your contacts into groups.
Using groups (as every kindergarten teacher could tell you) is a way to
arrange something (in your case, contacts) to make them more manage-
able. How you arrange your groups is really up to you because the orga-
nizing principle should be based on whatever makes sense (to you, at
least) and fits the group you set up. For example, you can place all your
customer contacts within a Clients group and family members and rela-
tives in a Family group. Then, instead of searching for names of individu-
als within one humongous list you can search within a smaller, more
manageable group.
or
 Set up your contacts so that you can use some kind of filter on them.
Another way to organize and streamline how your BlackBerry Address
Book lists your contacts is to use the Filter feature in combination with
BlackBerry’s Categories. (Categories is just another way how BlackBerry
Address Book helps you filter your contacts.) Using the Filter feature
narrows the Address Book list to such an extent that you have to use the
only trackwheel to scroll down and find your contact — no need to type
in search keywords, in other words.
Whether you use the Group or Filter feature is up to you. You’ll find out how
to use both methods in the next sections of this chapter.
Creating a group
A BlackBerry group in Address Book — as opposed to any other kind of
group you can imagine — is really just a simple filter or category. In other
78
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

words, a group just arranges your contacts into subsets without affecting the
content of your contact entries. In the Address Book itself, a group shows up
in the contact list just like any other contact. The only wrinkle here is that
when you select the group, the contacts associated with that group — and
only the contacts associated with that group — appear onscreen.
Need some help visualizing how this works? Go ahead and create a new
group, following these steps:
1. Highlight Address Book from the BlackBerry Home screen and press
the trackwheel.
The Address Book opens.
2. Press the trackwheel and choose New Group from the menu that
appears.
A screen similar to that in Figure 3-14 displays. The top portion of the
screen is where you type the group name, and the bottom portion is
where you add your list of group members.
3. Enter the name of the group in the New Group field.
You could name the group anything, but for the sake of this example, go
ahead and name the group Friends.
After entering the name of the group, you’re ready to save it. But hold on
a sec — you can’t save this group until you associate a member to it. To
satisfy such a hard-and-fast rule, proceed to the next step to add a
member.
4. Press the trackwheel and choose Add Member from the menu that
appears.
Figure 3-14:

79
Chapter 3: Remembering Your Acquaintances

The main Address Book list shows up in all its glory, ready to be pilfered
for names to add to your new Group list.
5. Scroll and highlight the name of a contact you want to add to your
new Group list. Then press the trackwheel and choose Continue from
the menu that appears.
Everybody knows a Rob Kao, so go ahead and select him. You’ll notice
that doing so places Rob Kao in your Friends group list, as shown in
Figure 3-15. (Rob Kao, a co-author of the book you’re holding in your
hands, is a very popular fellow.)
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 to add more friends to your list.
After you’re satisfied, save your group.
7. Press the trackwheel and choose Save Group from the menu that
appears.
Your Friends group is duly saved, and you can now see Friends listed on
your main Address Book list.
Using the Filter feature on your contacts
Are you a left-brainer or a right-brainer? Yankees fan or Red Sox fan? An Innie
or an Outie? Dividing up the world into categories is something everybody
does (no divisions there), so it should come as no surprise that BlackBerry
divides up your contacts into distinct categories as well.
By default, two categories are already set for you on your BlackBerry: the
Business category and the Personal category. But why stop at two? BlackBerry
makes it easy to create more categories. In this section, you first find out how
to categorize a contact, and then you see how to filter your Address Book list.
Finally, you find out how to create new categories.
Figure 3-15:
Your new

80
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Categorize your contacts
Whether you’re creating a new contact or editing an existing contact, as long
as you’re in Edit mode, you can categorize that particular contact.
If the trick is getting into Edit mode, it’s a pretty simple trick. Here’s how
that’s done:
1. Highlight Address Book from the BlackBerry Home screen and press
the trackwheel.
The Address Book opens.
2. Scroll to an existing contact, press the trackwheel, and then choose
Edit from the menu that appears.
Address Book is now in Edit mode for this particular contact, which is
exactly where you want to be.
3. Press the trackwheel and then choose Categories from the menu that
appears.
A Categories list appears, as shown in Figure 3-16. By default, you see
only the Business and the Personal categories.
4. Use the spacebar or press the trackwheel to select the check box next
to Personal.
5. Save your setting by pressing the trackwheel and choosing Save from
the menu that appears.
You are brought back to the Edit screen for this particular contact.
6. Press the trackwheel (again) and choose Save (again) from the menu
that appears to complete your changes.
Figure 3-16:
Default
categories.
81
Chapter 3: Remembering Your Acquaintances

You now have one — count ’em, one — contact with Personal as its category,
which means you can now filter your Address Book list using a category.
Here’s how:
1. Highlight Address Book from the BlackBerry Home screen and press
the trackwheel.
The Address Book opens.
2. Press the trackwheel and choose Filter from the menu that appears.
Your Categories list makes an appearance.
If you haven’t added any categories in the meantime, all you see here are
the default Business and Personal categories.
3. Use the spacebar or press the trackwheel to select the Personal 
check box.
Your Address Book list immediately shrinks to just the contacts
assigned to the Personal category, as shown in Figure 3-17.
As you add more contacts to a category, you can also use Find and enter the
first few letters of the name to search and further narrow down the search for
a contact. If you need a refresher on how this Find works, see the section
“Looking for Someone?” earlier in this chapter.
Adding a new category
Whoever thought the default categories Business/Personal were enough for the
complexities of the real world probably didn’t have many acquaintances, but
that’s neither here nor there. BlackBerry makes it easy to add new categories,
so you can divide up your world as much as you like. Just do the following.
Figure 3-17:
The
Address
Book list
after a filter
is applied.
82
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

1. Highlight Address Book from the BlackBerry Home screen and press
the trackwheel.
The Address Book opens.
2. Press the trackwheel and choose Filter from the menu that appears.
You get a view of the default categories. (Refer to Figure 3-16.)
3. Press the trackwheel (again) and choose New from the menu that
appears.
A pop-up screen displays, asking you to name the new category you
wish to create.
4. Enter a name for your category in the Name field and then press
ENTER.
After you enter the name of the category, it is automatically saved and
you see the Filter screen, which lists all the categories, including the one
you just created. Just press the Escape button to get back to the
Address Book main screen.
Commercial applications exist that are designed to be customized for corpo-
rate users. Be wary of vendors claiming that they can store huge amounts of
contacts on a BlackBerry using its Address Book application. There is a limit
on how much information you can fit in a small device like BlackBerry. Such 
a claim can compromise other features. For example, the Address Book might
use up so much of the memory capacity of your BlackBerry so as to limit
the number of old e-mails you can keep. Also, with so many contacts on an
Address Book, its Search feature will most likely be affected and slow down.
If you’re the one responsible for making decisions on purchasing such appli-
cations, make sure that you understand the needs of your BlackBerry users.
You should aim for the optimum balance between the limits of the device and
the memory needs of all the applications that are important to your users.
Keep in mind that the space capacity of a device depends on the model —
later ones tend to be bigger and also have faster processor chips. In our
observation, any search on the Address Book with the 6200 models (which
have 16MB of space) starts to get sluggish when your contacts reach a
number of around 2,000. Space isn’t really a problem unless you install more
applications that require more data. The 7100 models definitely perform
twice as well. But take this with a rather large grain of salt. Such ballpark esti-
mates are pretty ballpark — which is why they call it ballpark, we guess.
You might not be able to see special characters on the keyboard, such as
single quote. To enter a single quote, press the Alt key and SYM key to dis-
play the list of symbols. On the screen that follows, scroll and click the quote.
83
Chapter 3: Remembering Your Acquaintances

Note that the Address Book application won’t allow you to add a contact to a
group if that contact does not have an e-mail address. (It’s very strict on this
point.) If, however, you don’t have an e-mail address for someone you’d like
to add to a group, skirt this roadblock by editing that contact’s information
and putting in a fake (and clearly inactive) e-mail address such as
notareal@emailaddress.no.
Setting preferences
Vanilla, anyone? Some days you will wish that your Address Book list were
sorted a bit differently. For example, there’s that day when you’re really need
to find the guy who works for ABC Company but it happens to be that guy
with the foreign name that you can hardly pronounce, let alone spell. What’s
a body to do?
You’re in luck. Once again, the good people at RIM have anticipated this sce-
nario and have made available to you Address Book Options, which is a
palette of tricks that you can use to navigate some out-of-the-ordinary situa-
tions. Address Book Options sports a very simple screen, as Figure 3-18
makes clear, yet it provides you with three important options that change
how the Address Book behaves:
 Sort By: Allows you to change the way the list is sorted. You could
change the sort field criteria from First Name, Last Name, or Company
from the menu choices. You can use the space bar to toggle among the
choices.
 Confirm Delete: Allows you to display a Confirmation screen for all con-
tact deletions. You should always keep this feature turned on for normal
usage. Because there are many ways you could accidentally delete
somebody from your Address Book, this feature is a good way of mini-
mizing those accidents.
Figure 3-18:
Choose your
sort type
here.
84
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

 Allow Duplicate Names: Self-explanatory. If you turn this on, you can
have multiple people who happen to share the same name in your
Address Book. If it’s off, you get a warning when you try to add a name
that’s identical to someone who already exists on your list. Maybe
you’re just tired and mistakenly trying to add the same person twice to
your list. Then again, sometimes people just have the same name. We
recommend keeping the default value of Yes, allowing you to have con-
tacts with the same names.
How do you change any of these options? The fields behave like any other
fields on a BlackBerry application. You simply highlight the field, press the
trackwheel, and choose Change Option from the menu that appears. You then
see a menu screen that allows you to choose the possible option values. For
example, Figure 3-19 shows the possible Sort By fields.
Sharing a Contact
Suppose you want to share your contact information with a friend who hap-
pens to have a BlackBerry as well. A vCard (virtual [business] card) is your
answer and can make your life a lot easier. In BlackBerry Land, a vCard is a
contact, in your Address Book, that you send to someone as an attachment
to an e-mail. (Keep reading for more on sending vCards.) At the receiving end,
the BlackBerry device (being the smart device that it is) recognizes the
attachment and informs the BlackBerry owner that he or she has the option
of saving it, making it available for his or her viewing pleasure in the Address
Book.
Figure 3-19:
The Sort By
field

85
Chapter 3: Remembering Your Acquaintances

Sending a vCard
Because a vCard is nothing more than an Address Book contact attached to
an e-mail, sending a vCard is really a piece of cake. (Of course, you do need to
make sure that your recipient has a BlackBerry device to be able to receive
the information.)
Here’s how you’d go about sending a vCard:
1. Highlight the Messages application from the BlackBerry Home screen
and press the trackwheel.
Messages opens.
2. Press the trackwheel and choose Compose Email from the menu that
appears.
The Address Book appears for you to select recipients of your e-mail.
3. Scroll and highlight the name of person whom you want to receive
your vCard and then press the trackwheel.
You are now presented with an e-mail screen with the name you just
selected as the To recipient.
4. Enter the subject and your message to your recipient.
5. Press the trackwheel and choose Attach Address from the menu that
appears.
The Address Book again opens. This time, pick the contact information
you want to attach to your e-mail.
6. Scroll and highlight the name of the person whose contact informa-
tion you want attached and then press Enter.
The e-mail composition screen reappears, and an icon that looks like a
book indicates that the e-mail now contains your attachment. Now all
you have to do is send your e-mail.
7. Press the trackwheel and choose Send from the menu that appears.
You just shared the specified contact information. (Don’t you feel right
neighborly now?)
Receiving a vCard
If you’re the recipient of an e-mail that has a contact attachment, here’s how
you would go about saving it to your Address Book:
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
86
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Messages opens.
2. Scroll and highlight the e-mail that contains the vCard and then press
Enter.
The e-mail with the vCard attachment opens.
3. Scroll down to the attachment. When the cursor hovers over the
attachment, press the trackwheel and choose View Attachment from
the menu that appears.
The vCard makes an appearance onscreen. Now all you have to do is
save the contact in your Address Book.
4. Press the trackwheel and choose Add to Address Book from the menu
that appears.
The vCard is saved and is now available in your BlackBerry Address
Book.
Searching for Somebody outside 
Your Address Book
Is your BlackBerry provided by your employer? Do you use Outlook or Lotus
Notes on your desktop machine at work? If your answer to both of these
questions is yes, this section is for you. The BlackBerry Address Book has a
feature that allows you to search for people in your organization, basically
through Microsoft Exchange (for Outlook), IBM Domino (for Notes), or Novell
GroupWise. Exchange, Domino, and GroupWise serve the same purposes:
namely, to facilitate e-mail delivery in a corporate environment and to enable
access to a person database.
For you techies out there, these person databases are called Global Address
Lists (GAL) in Exchange; Notes Address Books in Domino; and GroupWise
Address Books in GroupWise.
If you want to search for somebody in your organization through a person
database, simply follow the following steps:
1. Highlight Address Book from the BlackBerry Home screen and press
the trackwheel.
The Address Book opens.
2. Press the trackwheel and choose Lookup from the menu that appears.
Some corporations might not have the Lookup feature enabled. Please
check with your IT department for more information.
87
Chapter 3: Remembering Your Acquaintances

Although you access the Lookup feature inside the Address Book, it
really is going beyond your device and into your company’s Exchange,
Domino, or GroupWise database, depending on which e-mail server your
company is using.
3. Enter the to-search-for name in the screen that displays and then press
ENTER.
You could enter the beginning characters of either a person’s surname
or first name. You are not searching on your Address Book but on your
company’s database, and this step might take some time to complete
depending on the criteria you entered.
For big organizations, we recommend being more precise when doing
your search. For example, searching for Dan yields more hits than
searching for Daniel. The more precise your search criteria, the fewer
hits you’ll get and the faster the search will be.
While the search is in progress, you’ll see the word Lookup
and the criteria that you put in at the top of the list. For example, if you
enter Daniel, the top row reads Lookup: Daniel. After the search is
done, BlackBerry displays the number of hits or the matches count: for
example, 20 matches: Daniel.
4. Highlight the matches count and press ENTER to display the list of
matches.
A screen displaying the matching names based on your criteria appears.
A header at the top of this screen details the matches displayed in the
current screen as well as the total hits. For example, if the header reads
something like Lookup Daniel (20 of 130 matches), 130 people
in your Organization have the name Daniel, and BlackBerry is displaying
the first 20. You have the option of fetching the rest by pressing the
trackwheel and choosing Get More Results from the menu that appears;
however, BlackBerry limits the display to 20 names per fetch.
You could also add the names listed on this result to your Address Book
by using the Add command (for the currently highlighted name) or the
Add All command for all the names on the list. (As always, press the
trackwheel to call up the menu containing these options.)
When you think you found the person you’re looking for, the next step is
to check the information to make sure you have the right person.
5. Highlight the person whose information you want to review and then
press ENTER.
The person’s contact information is displayed on a read-only screen.
Information might include the person’s title, e-mail address, work,
mobile and fax numbers, and the work’s snail-mail address. Any of that
information gives you confirmation about the person you’re looking for.
Of course, what shows up depends on the availability of this information
in your company’s database.

T
o some folks, the key to being organized and productive is mastering time
management and using their time wisely (and we’re not just talking about
reading this book while you’re commuting to work). Many have discovered
that there is no better way to organize one’s time than to use a calendar — 
a daily planner tool. Some prefer digital to paper, so they use a planner soft-
ware program on their PC — either installed on their hard drive or accessed
via an Internet portal (such as Yahoo!). The smartest of the bunch, of course,
use their BlackBerry handheld because it has the whole planner thing cov-
ered in handy form with its Calendar application.
In this chapter, we show you how to keep your life (personal and work) in
order by managing your appointments with your BlackBerry Calendar. What’s
great about managing your time on a BlackBerry versus your PC is that your
BlackBerry is always there with you to remind you. Just remember that you
don’t have excuses any more for missing or forgetting that important quar-
terly meeting or Bertha’s birthday bash.

Accessing the BlackBerry Calendar
The BlackBerry Calendar is one of the BlackBerry core applications, like
Address Book or Phone (read more about the others in Chapter 1), so it’s
quite easy to get to.
To get cracking with your Calendar, just scroll to the Calendar application on
your BlackBerry Home screen, click the trackwheel, and voilà! — you have
Calendar.
Choosing Your Calendar View
The first time you open Calendar, you’ll likely see the Day view, which is a
default setting on most of the BlackBerry models (See Figure 4-1.) You can
change the Calendar view, though, to a different one that works better for
your needs:
 Day: This view gives you a summary of your appointments for the day.
By default, it lists all your appointments from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Week: This view shows you a seven-day summary view of your appoint-
ments. By using this view, you can see how busy you are for the week.
 Month: The month view shows you every day of the month. You can’t
tell how many appointments are in a day, but you can see on which days
you have appointments.
 Agenda: The agenda view is a bit different from the other views. It isn’t a
time-based view like the others; it basically lists your upcoming appoint-
ments. And in the list, you can see details of the appointments, such as
where and when.
Figure 4-1:
Day view in
Calendar.
90
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Different views (like the ones shown in Figure 4-2) offer you a different focus
on your schedule. Select the view you want based on your scheduling needs
and preferences. If your life is a little more complicated, you can even use a
combination of views for a full grasp of your schedule.
To switch between different Calendar views, simply follow these steps:
1. Open Calendar by scrolling to the Calendar application on the Home
screen and clicking the trackwheel.
Doing so calls up the Calendar application in its default view — more
than likely the Day view.
2. While within the Calendar application, press the trackwheel and then
select the view of your choice from the menu that appears (shown in
Figure 4-3).
If you start from Day view, your choices are View Week, View Month, and
View Agenda.

Chapter 4: Never Miss Another Appointment — Ever!

Moving between Time Frames
Depending on what view of Calendar you’re in, you can easily move to the
previous or the next date/week/month/year.
For example, if you’re in the Month view, you can move to the next month
(um, relative to the month that is currently displayed). Likewise, you can also
move back to the previous month, if you so desire. In fact, if you like to look
at things long term, you can jump ahead (or jump back) a year at a time. (See
Figure 4-4 for a look at all the options.)
You have similar flexibility when it comes to the other Calendar views. See
Table 4-1 for a summary of what’s available.

Furthermore, you can jump to any date of your choosing by pressing the
trackwheel and selecting Go to Date from the menu that appears. Doing so
calls up a handy little dialog box that lets you choose the date you want. To
change dates, press Alt and use the trackwheel to scroll. (Figure 4-5 gives you
a glimpse of the dialog box.)
Customizing Your Calendar
To change the initial (default) view in your Calendar — from Day view to
Month view, for example — Calendar Options is the answer.
To get to Calendar Options, start out within Calendar, press the trackwheel,
and then choose Options from the menu that appears to access choices simi-
lar to the ones shown in Table 4-2.

your heart’s content (another three minutes, tops), it’s time (pun intended)
to set up, review, and delete appointments. We also show you how to set 
up a meeting with clients or colleagues.
Creating an appointment
Setting up a new appointment is way easy. You need only one piece of infor-
mation: when your appointment occurs. Of course, you can easily add related
information about the appointment, such as the meeting purpose, its loca-
tion, and whatever additional notes are helpful. 
In addition to your standard one-time, limited-duration meeting, you can also
set all-day appointments. And BlackBerry, that able little assistant, can also
help you set recurring meetings as well as reminders. Sweet.
94
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Creating a one-time appointment
To add a new appointment, follow these steps:
1. Open Calendar.
In case you don’t have this down pat, you open Calendar from the 
Home screen by scrolling to the Calendar application and clicking the 
trackwheel.
2. With Calendar open, press the trackwheel and then select New from
the contextual menu that appears.
The New Appointment screen appears for you, as shown in Figure 4-6.
3. Fill in the key appointment information.
You’re required to enter only the when. Of course, we suggest that you
also fill in the what and the where so you remember what your meeting’s
about in addition to arriving on time.
4. Press the trackwheel and choose Save from the contextual menu that
appears.
This saves your newly created appointment.
Your new appointment is now in your Calendar and viewable from any
Calendar view. Also, keep in mind that you can have more than one appoint-
ment in the same time slot. Why? Well, the BlackBerry Calendar allows con-
flicts in your schedule because it lets you make the hard decision about
which appointment you should forgo.
Figure 4-6:

95
Chapter 4: Never Miss Another Appointment — Ever!

Creating an all-day appointment
If your appointment is an all-day event — for example, if you’re in corporate
training or have an all-day doctor’s appointment — mark the All Day Event
check box in the New Appointment screen, as shown in Figure 4-7. You can do
so by scrolling to the check box and pressing the SPACE key. When this check
box is checked, you don’t have to specify the time of your appointment —
just the start date and end date.
Setting your appointment reminder time
Any appointment you enter in Calendar can have a reminder alert of some kind
associated with it either a vibration or a beep, depending on how you set things
up in your Profile. (For more on Profiles, see Chapter 2.) You can also have the
choice of no reminder for an appointment. From the New Appointment screen,
simply scroll to the Reminder field and select a reminder time anywhere from
none to 11 hours before your appointment time.
Profiles simply is another useful BlackBerry feature that allows you to cus-
tomize how your BlackBerry alerts you when an event occurs. Examples of
events can be an e-mail, phone call, or a reminder for an appointment.
By default, whatever reminder alert you have going for you is set to go off 15
minutes before the event. But you don’t have to stick with the default. In fact,
you can choose your own default reminder time. Here’s how:
1. Press the trackwheel in Calendar and select Options from the contex-
tual menu that appears. 
Doing so calls up the Options submenu.
2. Select Default Reminder from the Options submenu.
Here you can choose a default reminder time anywhere from none to 11
hours before your appointment.
Figure 4-7:
Set an All
Day event
here.
96
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

So from now on, any new appointment has a default reminder time of what
you just set up. Assuming that you have a reminder time other than none, the
next time you have an appointment coming up, you see a dialog box like the
one shown in Figure 4-8, reminding you of an upcoming appointment.
Creating a recurring appointment
You can set up recurring appointments based on daily/weekly/monthly/
yearly recurrences. Everyone has some appointment that repeats, such as
birthdays or anniversaries (or taking out the trash every Thursday at 7:30
a.m. — ugh).
For all recurrence types, you can define an Every field. For example, say you
have an appointment that recurs every nine days. Just set the Every field to
9, as shown in Figure 4-9. If you have an appointment that recurs for four
weeks, specify 4 in the End field for when the recurrences finish.
Figure 4-9:
An
appointment
recurring
every 9
days.
Figure 4-8:
You get a
Reminder
dialog box if
you want.
97
Chapter 4: Never Miss Another Appointment — Ever!

Depending on what you put in the Recurrence field, you have the option to 
fill in other fields, such as the Day of the Week field or the Relative Date
check box.
If you enter Weekly in the Recurrence field, for example, you have the option
of filling in the Day of the Week field. (It basically allows you to select the day
of the week on which your appointment recurs.)
If you enter Monthly or Yearly in the Recurrence field, the Relative Date
check box is available. With this check box checked, you can ensure that
your appointment recurs relative to today’s date. For example, if you choose
the following:
Start: Sunday, June 18, 2006 at 12 p.m.
End: Sunday, June 18, 2006 at 1 p.m.
Recurrence: Monthly
Every: 2
Relative Date: Selected
End: Saturday, July 31, 2010
then your appointment occurs every two months on the third Sunday until
July 31, 2010.
On the other hand, if all options in our example remain the same except that
Relative Date is not selected, your appointment occurs every two months, on
the 18th of the month until July 31, 2010.
If all this “relative” talk has you dizzy, don’t worry: The majority of your
appointments won’t be as complicated as this. If you’re getting a headache
from all this relativity, just skip the whole Relative Date for now and come
back when your life is complicated enough to need stuff like Relative Dates.
Opening an appointment
After you set an appointment, you can view it in a couple of ways. If you have
set up reminders for your appointment and the little Reminder dialog box
appears onscreen at the designated time before your appointment, you can
view your appointment by clicking the box’s Open button, as shown in Figure
4-9. Or you can open it from Calendar by going to the exact time of your
appointment and viewing it there.
98
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

While looking at an appointment, you have the option of making changes
(new appointment time or new appointment location) and then saving them.
Deleting an appointment
Deleting an appointment is quite straightforward. When in Day or Week view,
simply scroll to the appointment that you want to delete, press the track-
wheel, and choose Delete from the menu that appears.
If the appointment that you’re deleting is part of a recurring appointment, a
dialog box pops up onscreen asking if you want to delete all the occurrences
of this appointment or just this particular occurrence, as shown in Figure 4-10.
After you make your choice, your appointment is history.
Appointments versus Meetings
Technically, any event in your Calendar counts as an appointment, whether
it’s a reminder for your best friend’s birthday or a reminder of a doctor’s
appointment for a check up. However, when you invite people to an appoint-
ment or you get invited to one, regardless of whether it’s a face-to-face meet-
ing or a phone conference, that appointment then becomes a meeting.
Sending a meeting request
Sending a meeting request to others is very similar to creating a calendar
appointment.
Figure 4-10:
You can
delete all
occurrences
or just the

99
Chapter 4: Never Miss Another Appointment — Ever!

1. Open Calendar.
2. With Calendar open, press the trackwheel and then select New from
the contextual menu that appears.
3. Fill in the key appointment information (subject/location/time).
4. Press the trackwheel once and select Invite Attendee.
You’re taken to Address Book to select your meeting attendee.
5. From the Address Book:
• If you have contacts in your Address Book: Highlight the contact you
want and press the trackwheel.
• If you don’t yet have any contacts or if the one you want isn’t in your
Address Book: Use the Use Once option to enter the appropriate
e-mail address and press the ENTER key to finish and return to
Calendar. (For more on the Use Once option, see Chapter 7.)
6. After returning from Address Book, you see the attendees in your
Calendar meeting notice.
7. Press the trackwheel and choose Save from the contextual menu that
appears.
This action actually sends an e-mail to your meeting attendees, inviting
them to your meeting.
Responding to a meeting request
If you’ve ever worked in an office, you’ve likely gotten a meeting request by
e-mail, asking you to respond to the meeting by three options: Accept,
Tentative, or Decline. (If it’s from your boss for an all-staff meeting and you
just can’t afford to decline again because it’s so close to Christmas bonus
time, that’s an Accept.)
Fortunately (sometimes, unfortunately), you can accept any meeting request
from your managers or colleagues on your BlackBerry just as you would on
your desktop PC. In PC world, you respond to an e-mail request for a meeting
by clicking the appropriate button in your e-mail client (Microsoft Outlook,
for the vast majority of you out there.) In BlackBerry world, a meeting
request also comes in the form of an e-mail; upon reading the e-mail, just
choose from Accept/Tentative/Decline in the Messages application, as shown
in Figure 4-11. Your response is sent back in an e-mail. We go more into the
Messages application in Chapter 7.
100
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

After you initially respond to the meeting request, the meeting is added to
your Calendar automatically. Of course, if you have a change of heart later,
you can certainly change your response (yes, you can later decline that use-
less meeting) in Calendar.
Wirelessly Synching Your BlackBerry
Calendar with Desktop Calendar
Picture this: In MS Outlook (or Lotus Domino), you just scheduled a meeting
with Jennifer, a client, in one hour at her office 15 miles away. You hurry out
of your office without synching your BlackBerry. About 45 minutes later, your
BlackBerry beeps at you to remind you that you have a meeting with Jennifer
in 15 minutes. You think to yourself, “Am I dreaming, or is my BlackBerry 
psychic?”
Your BlackBerry is smart but not that smart. If you received your BlackBerry
from your company, chances are that your company’s BlackBerry system
administrators have set up a wireless Calendar for everyone in the company
who carries a BlackBerry.
Furthermore, not only do you see changes from Outlook on your BlackBerry,
but vice versa. That is, if you set a meeting or appointment on your BlackBerry
while on the go, you can see it in Outlook when you get back into the office.
Don’t believe us? Try it!

Being Your Own Taskmaster
In This Chapter
 Getting to know the Tasks application
 Adding, changing, and deleting tasks
 Managing your Tasks list
 Setting up recurring tasks
U
sing your BlackBerry as an organizational tool is one of the key themes
that we try to promote many times in this book. And speaking of organi-
zation, what better proof of your impressive organizational skills could exist
than the fact that you use task lists/to-do lists? Knowing what you need to do
today, tomorrow, the entire week, or perhaps the whole month makes you
more efficient on your job and in your personal life. The fact is that you not
only need to know what your tasks are, but you also need to prioritize them —
and reprioritize them, if necessary. And with your BlackBerry as your able
assistant, you can.
In this chapter, we introduce you to your BlackBerry device’s Tasks applica-
tion. Stick with us as we explore this valuable tool, jumping from creating 
and maintaining your to-do list to setting alerts for a recurring task in a 
single bound. We also throw in a few tips and tricks to make maintaining 
and searching your Tasks list easier and faster. Of course, we can’t advise 
you on how to actually do the task after your BlackBerry calls your attention
to it, but with your BlackBerry in your palm, you’re at least a step closer to
clearing your desk. 
Even if you keep a to-do list on your desktop (Outlook, anyone?), consider
switching to all BlackBerry, all the time. You’ll love the greater flexibility that
comes with greater mobility. And, if you just can’t give up your desktop appli-
cation, you have the option of using both applications and just synchronizing
them. (More about that later in the chapter.)

The Tasks application we describe here is the latest version as of this writing.
Some earlier models don’t have features like Filter, but the core functionality
hasn’t changed. When we describe a feature not on the earlier models, we
point that out. If you have older models of BlackBerry, you can avail yourself
of the latest version of Tasks by upgrading your OS. (See Chapter 12 for
details on how to upgrade your OS.) Core BlackBerry applications including
Tasks are bundled with the OS.
Accessing Tasks
Depending on the BlackBerry model you have, launching Tasks is just a single
press of the trackwheel. For most BlackBerry models — in fact, on most of
the non-7100 models — Tasks is visible at the onset, on the Home screen, 
as you can see in Figure 5-1. Just look for the icon of a notepad with a pen 
on top.
On the 7100 series, Tasks is accessible via the Application icon, as shown in
Figure 5-2. Locating a task is easy — just highlight Applications and press the
trackwheel. On the screen that follows, you should find Tasks. Note that on
7100 models, Research In Motion (RIM) expanded the Themes feauture —
Themes being a neat setup that allows you to select the look and feel of your
display. Although you can’t create your own theme, you can select from pre-
installed themes. The number of themes installed on your device can vary
from service provider to service provider. For example, take a look at Figure
5-3 to see the difference between RIM and T-Mobile themes:
 RIM: The left screen of Figure 5-3 uses a List theme that comes from RIM.
Here, a simple listing is used in lieu of icons. 
 T-Mobile: The right screen on Figure 5-3 uses the T-Mobile theme.
(Depending on your service provider, the device might be set to that of
the provider’s theme, like the one we have here for T-Mobile. In other
words, don’t always expect to see what you see here.) On the T-Mobile
theme, icons are used, and you have to navigate through the Applications
(the toolbox image) and the Tasks icon (the notepad image) as you can
see in Figure 5-2.
Figure 5-1:
Accessing
the Tasks
application
on non-7100
models.
104
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

For the 7100 series, the icons used by other providers might be different from
what you see presented here for your delight by T-Mobile. If this is the case
for your BlackBerry, just remember that Tasks is always within Applications.
If you can locate the Applications icon, it’s just a matter of pressing the track-
wheel to locate the Tasks icon.
Recording a New Task
The first step when building a to-do list is to start recording one. Don’t groan
and roll your eyes, dreading how long this will take. This is really easy, so just
relax, and you’ll be done in a snap.
Just follow these simple steps:
1. Highlight the Tasks icon and press the trackwheel.
The Tasks application opens. Similar to Address Book and MemoPad,
the screen that appears is divided into two parts: The top shows the
Figure 5-3:
The Tasks

105
Chapter 5: Being Your Own Taskmaster

Find field, and the bottom shows the list of tasks (if there are tasks) or *
No Tasks * (if empty).
2. Press the trackwheel and choose New from the Tasks Application
menu that appears (as shown on the left in Figure 5-4).
The New screen appears, as shown on the right side of Figure 5-4, ready
and willing to document your new task. This simple screen features
easy-to-understand fields that describe the task you’re about to enter.
3. Use your trackwheel to move to each field to enter information for
your task.
Some fields are for text that you enter yourself, and some fields hold
items you select from a menu specific for that field. In other words, for
text fields, you have to type in the stuff you want; but for nontext fields,
you select the field, press the trackwheel again, and then select your
choice from the Change Option menu that appears. (Pretty convenient,
huh?) We explain all these fields later in the section, “Navigating the
Tasks Fields.”
To access the Change Option menu, select a field and then press the
trackwheel.
4. After filling in the relevant fields, press the trackwheel and choose
Save from the Tasks Application menu that appears.
Doing so saves your task, and you should see the task added to the
Tasks list.
Navigating the Tasks Fields 
The New task screen (refer to Figure 5-3) is very straightforward and contains
few fields. Although the few fields there are pretty self-explanatory, we (being
the thorough guys that we are) describe each one here.
Figure 5-4:
Choose
New (left),
and an

screen
appears
(right).
106
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Task field
Use this field to log the subject or a short description of your task. Make this
field very descriptive: The subject you type here should be specific enough
that you can differentiate this task from the rest on your list. For example, if
you make several presentations to clients, you don’t want to call your task
Prepare Presentations. You want to be specific so that you can distinguish it.
Perhaps name it Product X Benefit Forecast to XYZ CFO. While at this field,
you can simply enter the subject or title of this task.
Status field
Fill in the Status field to indicate the current state of your task. Status is a
selection field — that is, after entering the field you press the trackwheel and
select an entry from a Change Option menu specific to that field.
The Change Option menu choices you see give you a pretty good idea what
the field is meant for. The following are the possible values you can choose
from:
 Not Started: You haven’t started this task yet. Because this choice is the
most common, Not Started is the default choice when creating a new
task.
 In Progress: You are in the midst of the task.
 Completed: You are done with the task.
 Waiting: Your task is ongoing and dependent on another task or another
event. For example, you’re waiting for Joe in Accounting to get you a
spreadsheet so that you can include it in your report and complete the
task.
 Deferred: Your task is on hold. Maybe you just don’t need to work on
this task at the moment, or you want more information before you
decide whether this task is worth doing. Either way, you want to keep
the task listed so that you can track it or resurrect it. Perhaps this task
isn’t a big deal today, but could become very important in a month or
two. By tagging a task as Deferred, you keep yourself aware of a task that
might or might not ramp up.
Priority field
In the Priority field, you can specify the timeliness or urgency of the task.
Like the Status field, the choices here are selections you make from a Change
Option menu. You can choose from one of the following values:
107
Chapter 5: Being Your Own Taskmaster

 High: This is the highest possible setting. You should consider the most
urgent task to be of high priority.
 Normal: This is the default value, which applies to most tasks. In reality,
a Normal task can jump to become a High priority when not done in
time, but you have to decide and assign that for yourself.
 Low: Just like you’d surmise, a Low rating tags a task as being not that
critical — you can put this one off until you’re done with the High and
Normal tasks. You can rate all your nice-to-have tasks with this priority.
Hint: When you’re finished with your High and Normal tasks, repriori-
tize your Low tasks.
Due field
Consider the Due field as your task completion deadline. Here, you can enter
a due date for your task. The default here is None; to change the value to a
specified due date, follow these steps:
1. Highlight the field, press the trackwheel and then choose Change
Option from the menu that appears. 
Change Option appears in the menu only if you are in a selection such as
Due field.
A pop-up menu appears onscreen offering two options: None and By
Date.
2. Highlight the By Date option and press the trackwheel.
A date field appears on the next line, as shown in Figure 5-5. The value of
the date defaults to the current date. If the current date is not your
intended due date, proceed to Step 3 to change the value of this date.
Figure 5-5:
Set a task’s
due date
here.
108
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

3. Highlight the specific portion of the date that you want to change,
press the trackwheel, and choose Change Option from the menu that
appears.
The portion of the date that you highlight when choosing Change Option
is now editable. The date portions that you can change are
• Month
• Day
• Year
• Time components
Although this is a date field — like any date fields in Tasks, for that
matter — this will not show up or create an entry in your Calendar.
4. Using the trackwheel, scroll to the specific date value you want and
then press the trackwheel to accept the change.
At this point, you should have the right value of the date component you
want.
Note: Say you modified the day but you want a specific time on that day.
Repeat Steps 3 and 4 but this time highlight (and edit) the time component of
the date.
While you are specifying the due date, you might see the Recurrence and No
Recurrence fields. These fields show up only when you select By Date in the
Due field. Intrigued? Check the later part of this chapter, specifically the sec-
tion titled “Creating Recurring Tasks,” for more details about these fields.
Time Zone field
The Time Zone field holds the time zone related to the date fields used for
this task: Due (preceding section) and Reminder (following section). If these
fields have values of None, this field is irrelevant. You can specify a time zone
different from your locale. For example, if you live in New York and you antici-
pate that you are completing this task in Mexico City, you can specify the
Mexico City time zone; then, all the times in this task become relative to
Mexico City.
Reminder field
From the Reminder field (a date field), you can set an alarm or a notice on the
date and time you specify. You can set it just like you would set the Due field.
(See the earlier section, “Due field.”) Setting a reminder is quite useful, espe-
cially for those important tasks that you really can’t afford to forget (um, like
buying a birthday gift for your significant other).
109
Chapter 5: Being Your Own Taskmaster

Again, just like any date field in Tasks, this will not show up in your Calendar.
The reminder behavior is based on your active Profile. Please check Chapter
2 for more details on how to customize notifications in your Profile.
When the reminder date is met, BlackBerry notifies you and displays a
reminder screen. On this screen, you will see the name of the task and possi-
ble actions: Open (opens the task), Mark Completed (shows up for task with
status other than Completed), and Dismiss (closes the screen).
Categories field
Use the Categories field to assign a specific category that you can use to filter
your tasks list later. Note: This feature is available only on BlackBerry devices
with OS version 4.0. By default, this field is blank; however, you can easily
assign a value to it from the Categories screen available via the context menu.
We find using the Categories field important for organizing your list, so we
describe it fully in the separate section, “Organizing Your Tasks List.”
Notes field
The Notes field is a free-for-all text field. You can put anything here you want,
such as a detailed description of the tasks or any other info that relates to
this task.
Updating Your Tasks
When it’s time to update your Tasks list — say, after finishing a high-priority
task or when you want to change the due date for a specific task — the Tasks
application won’t stand in your way. For whatever reasons you have, you can
quickly go back to your task list and update those records.
To update a specific task, follow these steps:
1. Highlight the Tasks icon and press the trackwheel.
The Tasks application opens to the Find screen, which displays your
current Tasks list. 
2. In the Tasks list, highlight the task you need to edit, press the track-
wheel, and then choose Open from the menu that appears.
110
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

The screen that opens is the same one you used to create the high-
lighted task, although obviously this display has fields filled with the
information you already entered.
3. Update the fields.
Go through each of the fields that you want to edit.
The Task and Notes fields are text fields that you can edit from here. To
update the other fields, you have to highlight the field and then press
the trackwheel to access the Change Option menu.
4. Press the trackwheel and then choose Save from the menu that
appears.
This saves your task, and you can see the task update on the Tasks list.
Deleting a Task
Just like folks make a ritual of spring cleaning when winter fades, the same is
true for your tasks. When a task is completed and keeping it just takes up
space, simply delete it via your Tasks application.
In simple steps, here’s how:
1. Highlight the Tasks icon and press the trackwheel.
The Tasks application opens, displaying your Tasks list.
2. Using your trackwheel, scroll to the task you want to delete, press the
trackwheel, and then choose Delete from the menu that appears.
You see the standard Confirmation screen.
3. If you’re sure that this task is doomed for the dustbin, highlight Delete
on the Confirmation screen and press the trackwheel.
The task is deleted, and your Tasks list is updated.
Organizing Your Tasks List
As time goes by, your Tasks list is sure to grow — which means that the time
it takes to find a task within your List is sure to grow as well. One way to stay
organized is to make it a habit to delete finished tasks from your list, as we
detail in the previous section. (The shorter the list, the better, as we always
say.) We recommend weeding out your Tasks list every time a project or a
goal is completed. After all, when a particular project is completed, you prob-
ably don’t need to go back to the tasks you did for it.
111
Chapter 5: Being Your Own Taskmaster

If you’re someone who just loves to document everything you accomplish (or
you work in an environment where you’re expected to keep a listing of tasks
completed — can you say quarterly employee review?), then you might not
relish the idea of deleting any entry from your Tasks list. Don’t despair,
though. In that case, just regularly archive a copy of your entire Tasks list
before you do any weeding, and you’ll have a complete record of every stitch
of hard work you contributed to a project. To archive, just synchronize your
BlackBerry with your desktop and store the data in whatever time manage-
ment software you use on your desktop. BlackBerry can synchronize to your
personal as well as your enterprise time management software. (For details
on how to synchronize, see Part IV of this book.)
After synchronization, you can print the Tasks list related to this completed
project (via your desktop application), which you can file. Having a hard
copy of those completed tasks can give you peace of mind as you delete
tasks from your BlackBerry. The best of both worlds, right? You clean up
your Tasks list (making it easier for you to do a search), and you’ve got your-
self an archive (in case you need a historical reference).
Another way to stay organized is to sort your Tasks list. Even after you weed
out tasks you’ve completed, you may still have difficulty finding a task from
your list. Fear not; help is available. Chances are that when you look for a
task, you know something identifiable about it, like its priority or due date.
Because you assign information about your task when you create it (see the
earlier sections, “Navigating the Tasks Fields” and “Updating Your Tasks”),
you can use that information as part of a Task sort in your BlackBerry. By
default, your Tasks list is sorted by the name/subject of your task, but you
can also sort by priority, due date, or status. For example, if you know the
due date of your task, you can sort your list by due date and thus quickly 
find the task at hand.
“Sounds great,” you say, “but how do I change the Sort criteria?” We’re glad
you asked. Since changing how you sort basically involves customizing your
BlackBerry device, we’re going to stick that discussion in the next section —
entitled, appropriately enough, “Customizing Tasks.”
Customizing Tasks
You can make two — count ’em, two — Tasks customizations via the Options
screen: Sort By criteria and deletion confirmation. Now, locating the Options
screen from the Tasks application is easy. Just press the trackwheel, highlight
Options in the menu that appears, and then press the trackwheel again. 
You see the Tasks Options screen displaying your two choices, as shown 
in Figure 5-6.
112
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

 Sort By: Here you can change how the list is sorted.
The default task listing is the alphabetical order of the subject from A to
Z (no reverse). To change to a different sort field
a. Highlight the Sort By field in the Tasks Options screen.
b. Press the trackwheel to display the Task Application menu.
c. Choose Change Option from the Task Application menu.
A list displays your sorting options. You can choose from Subject,
Priority, Due Date, or Status.
d. Highlight your choice and then press the trackwheel.
 Confirm Delete: This option allows you to control whether you want the
application to display a Confirmation screen upon deleting an item from
your list. In other BlackBerry applications, this option is common. These
confirmations appear as a safety feature so you don’t accidentally press
Delete and lose something you really didn’t want to lose. It’s true that
you can always turn this feature off in any one of your BlackBerry appli-
cations, but we generally recommend that you keep the value of this
field set to Yes, meaning that it prompts you for every delete.
There are exceptions to every rule, however. When you begin to weed
out a bunch of outdated tasks from your Tasks list, toggle this feature off
so that you don’t get 27 prompts in a row when you’re deleting 27 items.
(But then, toggle the feature back on when you’re done weeding.)
To turn off this feature, just do the following:
a. In the Tasks Options screen, highlight the Confirm Delete field, press
the trackwheel, and then choose Change Option from the menu that
appears. See Figure 5-7.
The screen shows your two choices: Yes and No. No means you
want to toggle off the Confirmation screen.
Figure 5-6:
Change
your Tasks
sort options

113
Chapter 5: Being Your Own Taskmaster

b. Highlight No and press the trackwheel.
The Tasks Options screen updates to show No in the Confirm
Delete field.
c. Press the trackwheel and then choose Save from the menu that
appears.
The Tasks application applies the changes you made.
Another field you can see from this screen is Number of Entries. This field is
really just informational, showing you how many tasks you have total on your
Tasks application.
Creating a category
Sometimes sorting on a specific criterion such as Subject or Due Date still
might not give you a quick answer to what you’re looking for. For example, if
you want to know how many more personal tasks you still have to do as
opposed to the more business-oriented stuff you’ve got going, sorting is of no
help, right? What you really need is a way to filter your list based on certain
groups that you define. (Personal versus Business would be a good start.)
The good people at RIM anticipated such a need and introduced categories in
version 4.0.
So what exactly is a category, and why is it important? A category is a way for
you to group your tasks in a manner that you can come back to. The grouping
is the category, and the listing with a certain category is a filter. To make a
task part of a group or category, you simply assign it a category when you
record a task, or you can update the task and assign it a category then. (See
earlier sections in this chapter for how to do both.)
Figure 5-7:
Toggle

confirmation

114
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

To make use of this feature, start by creating a category using the following
steps:
1. Highlight the Tasks icon and press the trackwheel.
The Tasks application opens, displaying your Tasks list in the Find
screen.
2. Press the trackwheel and then choose Filter from the menu that
appears.
The Select Category screen appears (see Figure 5-8) listing all the avail-
able categories. The two default entries on the list are Business and
Personal.
Figure 5-8:

115
Chapter 5: Being Your Own Taskmaster
The wonders of version 4.0
Obviously, this entire discussion of categories is
intended for those who have OS version 4.0 and
higher on their device. (This feature is not avail-
able on the prior versions.) If you have a 7100
series model BlackBerry, you are most likely
using 4.0. For other models, here are some ways
to determine what version your model uses.
Note: Depending on the version number, the
options might not be available to you:
 From the Help screen: Press ALT+CAP+H.
If you don’t see a Help screen, most likely you
have version 4.0 or higher, but try the next option
(from the About screen).
If you do see the Help screen, look for the
number of the App Version.
 From the About Screen: You can open
Options from your Home screen and choose
About. You should see v4.0.x.x if you have
version 4.0.
If your App Version is not 4.0 or higher, you can
skip this Categories business altogether.

By all means, feel free to use these default categories. Consider, though,
that these categories are really broad and might not be as helpful if you
have a lot of tasks. (Imagine going to a grocery store with only two sec-
tions: perishable and non-perishable. That would be a nightmare if you
are looking for the things you need.) Our advice to you: using this Steps
list, go the extra mile and create some new categories to work with.
Strive to define groups or categories that are meaningful in your line of
work and not so broad.
3. Press the trackwheel and then choose New from the menu that
appears.
The New Category screen appears, allowing you to define a new cate-
gory. Imagine that.
4. In the New Category screen, enter your category name in the text
field that appears and press the trackwheel.
Doing so establishes your category and lists it as an option in the Select
Category screen. Refer to Figure 5-8.
You can define as many categories as you want up-front. This way, you don’t
have to go back and create them. After you have the category(ies) you want,
assign your tasks to this category. In the upcoming section, “Filtering the
list,” we discuss how you can filter the list with it.
One important aspect of categories you should be aware of is that they are
shared among applications: specifically, among Address Book, MemoPad, and
Tasks. This sibling relationship might sound trivial at first, but don’t make the
common mistake of assuming that what you change in Tasks does not affect
other BlackBerry apps. The case of categories would show you how wrong
such assumptions are. The importance of this comes into play when deleting
a category in an application. For example, if you’re working in Tasks and you
decide to delete a category, you’ll soon discover that you’ve lost that cate-
gory in your Address Book as well (with it all its assignments). (The Address
Book contact is still intact but will be missing the category assignment.)
Assigning categories to your tasks
Here’s how to assign a category to an existing task while you’re in the Tasks
application:
1. Highlight the task on the Tasks list, press the trackwheel, and then
choose Open from the menu that appears.
The Edit Task screen appears, ready for any changes you’d like to make.
116
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

2. Highlight the Category field, press the trackwheel, and then choose
Change Option from the menu that appears.
3. Use the trackwheel to navigate to the category you want from the list
that appears; then press the trackwheel.
The category you selected is entered into the field. 
4. Press the trackwheel and choose Save from the menu that appears.
The change on the category is saved.
5. Press the trackwheel again and choose Save from the menu that
appears.
The task itself is saved.
Filtering the list
As you can read in the preceding section, you create categories and assign
them to your tasks. To see the tasks associated with a certain category, just
filter the list, which is way easy. Like all other options, Filter is available
through the menu while you are in the Tasks application. Selecting that menu
option gives you a screen that allows you to select any category listed. After
you choose a category, the list is filtered so that only those tasks assigned to
the chosen category are visible.
So much for the overview. Here are the nitty gritty details:
1. Highlight the Tasks icon and press the trackwheel.
The Tasks application opens, displaying your Tasks list.
2. Press the trackwheel and choose Filter from the menu that appears.
The Select Category screen appears, listing all the available categories.
(Refer to Figure 5-8.)
3. Using the trackwheel, scroll to the category you want, press the track-
wheel, and then choose Change Option from the menu that appears.
A filtered list, containing just the tasks associated with the chosen cate-
gory, appears. Note that the list has the category name as the heading,
as shown in Figure 5-9.
Define as many categories as you want up-front. That way, you don’t have 
to go back and create them. After you have the all the categories you want,
divide your tasks into appropriate categories to make running a task sort
easier.
117
Chapter 5: Being Your Own Taskmaster

Creating Recurring Tasks
A more advanced feature in Tasks is to create a recurring task — you know,
one that repeats periodically. Maybe the recurring task is deadline-driven,
like filing your taxes or paying bills, or buying presents for your significant
other for birthdays, Valentine’s Day, or anniversaries. (These are the kinds 
of tasks that cost so much if you fail to remember. Wouldn’t it be nice if you
simply create one task once for all for his/her birthdays to remind you two
weeks prior to buy a gift?) Other times, a recurring task might be something 
a bit more mundane, like turning in a weekly status report to your boss.
Making a task recur is really simple, although it might not be obvious at first.
(Rest assured; we show you the trick.) Basically, you either create a task from
scratch or you use an existing task.
If you don’t see the Recurrence field while looking at your existing task, the
task doesn’t have a due date — and it has to have a due date for the
Recurrence field to show up.
Say you want a task to repeat every year. With the Tasks application running,
do the following to make a task recur on a yearly basis:
1. In the Tasks list, highlight the task you want to recur, press the track-
wheel, and then choose Open from the menu that appears.
Because you simply want to edit this task, choose Open. It should dis-
play the Edit Task screen for the specified task.
2. (Optional) If the Due field in the Edit Task screen reads None, high-
light the field, press the trackwheel, choose Change Option from the
menu that appears, and then choose By Date from the smaller
Selection menu.
Figure 5-9:
A filtered
task list.
118
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

The screen displays a Date field — short for Due Date. The default date
is the current date, so if you haven’t yet changed the default date to
your due date, do that now. (The “Due field” section, earlier in this chap-
ter, has all the details on how to do this.)
If you scroll down the screen, notice that the Recurrence field appears
with a default value of None. Recurrence will always be shown once a
due date is specified, so you will see it the next time you open this task.
3. Highlight the Recurrence field, press the trackwheel, and then choose
Change Option from the menu that appears.
Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly selections appear. These designate
when your task recurs. For our current example, we want this task to
repeat yearly.
4. Highlight Yearly from the list and press the trackwheel.
At this point, your task recurs yearly, beginning on the date you specify
in the Due field (Step 2). Note the End field below the Recurrence field:
This field is the end of the recurrence and comes handy when you spec-
ify a relative reminder. For example, consider the following:
Due: Thu, Dec 15, 2005 5:00 p.m.
Reminder: Relative 15 Min.
Recurrence: Yearly
Every: 1
End: Mon, Dec 15, 2008
Relative Date: (Checked)
Occurs every year until Dec 15, 2008
Then your task recurs every December 15 of each year until 2008. From
the behavior of this task versus a non-recurring task, you won’t see any
difference. However, at 4:45 p.m. every December 15, you will get a
reminder, displaying a screen in your BlackBerry about this task. By
default, your BlackBerry will vibrate to alarm you (check Chapter 2 for
details on customizing your Tasks notification in Profiles). However,
your last reminder will be December 15, 2008 because you set up the
task to end on this day.
Also, after the End field is a Relative Date checkbox field. To
check/uncheck this field, use the trackwheel to scroll and highlight the
field and then press the Space key. Mark the Relative Date field if the
date is not exact but relative on the day: For example, you want the task
to recur every third Thursday of December instead of every occurrence
of December 15. This field is associated to Recurrence and will only
appear whenever it’s appropriate. In fact, you will not see this field for
daily or weekly — only for monthly and yearly recurrence.

 Converting from metric to English measurement systems and vice versa
You know what a memo pad is. Most people take them to meetings. Yes,
you take them to those looong and sometimes boooring meetings. Bored
and need to stay awake? Your memo pad is the answer. You can draw faces,
doodle fanciful designs, or even write a poem, all the while pretending to
listen to the blabbering of your colleagues or boss. Why do people like to call
for meetings? Let’s get everybody in a room and talk about something that
doesn’t concern them. Just lovely, isn’t it? Well, we got distracted there. What
we describe in this chapter is your e-memo pad for taking notes — the aptly
named MemoPad — on your BlackBerry. (Just no drawings of faces, though.)
Your BlackBerry has another very handy application that saves you from having
to stuff yet another gizmo in your pocket or purse: its built-in Calculator.
MemoPad
MemoPad on your BlackBerry can prove very handy, indeed. If nothing else,
use it to jot down important notes and ideas you might forget. How many
frustrating times do we have to endure for not remembering a fleeting
thought? Like when we call somebody to ask about something but after the
hello and the weather talk, we could no longer remember why we called in
the first place. We forget small things, and sometimes we forget important

ones. It is natural; writing down your thoughts is the best way. Or as you
might expect it from us, use your handy-dandy BlackBerry.
In upcoming sections, we explore how to jot down notes using MemoPad as
well as how to effectively organize your notes and come back to them quickly
by using filters. We also throw in tips on how to print your notes.
Accessing MemoPad
Accessing MemoPad is a snap. If you own a 7100 series model, you can get to
it via the Applications link. For other models, MemoPad is located right on the
Home screen. Figure 6-1 shows the link to MemoPad on 7100 series models
sporting a List theme (left) and a T-Mobile theme (right). On the T-Mobile, the
icon used to represent MemoPad is a spiral notebook with a pencil on top.
Older models show the MemoPad icon as a piece of paper with a pin on top.
Jotting down notes
After MemoPad is open, recording notes is a breeze. Simply press the track-
wheel to display the MemoPad menu you see on the left of Figure 6-2.
Selecting the New option from this menu gets you an empty memo screen, as
shown on the right of Figure 6-2. A line divides the screen; the top field is for
the title of your memo; and bottom part is where you enter your memo.
There is no limit on the size of the memo as long as your BlackBerry has the
space capacity to store it.
Figure 6-1:
Open
MemoPad
here.
122
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

When entering the note title, briefly describe the subject. If you use long
words, four words are about the optimum; otherwise, five words can fit.
Of course, you can enter more than five words — or as many as you want —
but remember that the BlackBerry screen isn’t very wide. MemoPad displays
the title as one line in the main MemoPad screen, which is the Find list. If
your note title is longer than the width of the screen, the title is truncated
with an ellipsis (...) at its end.
Because your MemoPad list is sorted alphabetically, pay special attention to
choosing a helpful first word when entering the title. Use descriptive words
and refrain from starting with A, An, The, This, and similar words.
Just like jotting down new memos, you can access all your memos easily in the
MemoPad list and act on them using the menu. Remember that the menu, just
like in other applications, is always available by pressing the trackwheel. The
menu that displays is in context with the currently selected memo, as shown in
Figure 6-3. From this figure, you can see the link to View, Edit, and Delete.

123
Chapter 6: Making Notes and Calculations

Viewing your notes
Obviously, you jot a memo for future reference. Viewing the memo is the next
logical step. After MemoPad is open, you can use the trackwheel to scroll and
highlight the memo you want to view. Simply press the trackwheel and
choose View from the menu that appears. Voila! A read-only screen displaying
your memo shows up.
If you are not happy with the font size, whether it’s too small or too big,
Chapter 2 has the details on how to customize display fonts. MemoPad is
using the global preferences defined in Options (Screen/Keyboard).
View is the default action for a highlighted memo. By pressing the Enter key,
the highlighted memo displays in view or read-only mode.
Updating your notes
Change is inevitable or perhaps you made a mistake in your note taking. No
problem. Updating your memo is easy. Just as when viewing your contact,
highlight the memo you want to edit from the MemoPad list. Press the track-
wheel and click Edit from the menu that appears. An editable screen similar
to the screen you used to add a memo shows up. Make your edits and once
you are content, save it by pressing the trackwheel and choosing Save from
the menu that appears.
Deleting your notes
Face it, half of the sticky notes you find in your desk are no longer relevant.
Your MemoPad is no different. Delete what you don’t need. Highlight the memo
you want to delete from your MemoPad list, press the trackwheel, and click
Delete from the menu that appears. Ready to say goodbye? Highlight and
choose Delete from the Delete Memo confirmation screen. Your memo is gone.
The confirmation screen you see when deleting a memo is a feature common
to all out-of-the-box BlackBerry applications such as Address Book, Tasks,
Calendar, and MemoPad. It diminishes the accidental deletion of records. You
can enable or disable this feature. The ability to disable it is useful when
you’re dishing out lots of memos and don’t want to be bothered with a confir-
mation screen for every memo to be deleted. (But then toggle the feature
back on when you’re done deleting.)
124
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

To turn off this feature, just do the following:
1. On the MemoPad Options screen, highlight the Confirm Delete field,
press the trackwheel, and then choose Change Option from the menu
that appears. See Figure 6-4.
The screen shows your two choices: Yes and No. No means you want to
toggle off the Confirmation screen.
2. Highlight No and press the trackwheel.
The MemoPad Options screen updates to show No in the Confirm Delete
field.
3. Press the trackwheel and then choose Save from the menu that
appears.
The MemoPad application applies the changes you made.
Another field you can see from the MemoPad Options screen is Number of
Entries. This field is really just informational, showing you how many memos
you have on your MemoPad application.
Quickly finding a note
Take another look at the left-hand screen in Figure 6-2. See the Find field?
You’ll soon discover that this Find field is always present on the main
MemoPad screen. Next to Find is an entry field. Just like the BlackBerry
Address Book (see Chapter 3), you can use this feature to find a note. (Ah,
the importance of good note naming becomes clearer all the time.) Just start
Figure 6-4:
Toggle
delete
confirmation
here.
125
Chapter 6: Making Notes and Calculations

typing in this Find field, and the note list below shrinks based on matches. 
A match is simply a hit, based on the starting letters of all the words of the
subjects — from the Title field, as discussed in the preceding section — in
your list. As you type more letters in the Find field, your MemoPad note list is
filtered more. For example, if you type bi, Find filters the list for those notes
with subjects having words that start with bi, like birthday, as you can see
from the screen in Figure 6-5.
Organizing your notes
Although using MemoPad is indeed incredibly easy and helpful, you can make
using it more effective by organizing your notes list according to your needs.
Like in Address Book and Tasks, you can group your notes and then filter your
note list based on a grouping. Simply define a group — a category — and then
assign that category to a note. You can make your list display only those
notes belonging to a specific category via the MemoPad Filter menu item.
(See the preceding section for more on using Find.)
Creating a category
Creating a category is simple. As we mention earlier, categories are common
to most of BlackBerry applications like Address Book and Tasks — and, of
course, MemoPad. Not only common, but categories you create in any of
these applications are shared. Whatever category you see in MemoPad is the
same category you see in Tasks or Address Book. You can access a category
from the menu of any of these BlackBerry applications. To create a category
from MemoPad, follow these steps:
1. Highlight MemoPad on the Home screen and press the trackwheel.
When MemoPad opens, you see the list of your notes.
Figure 6-5:
Search
notes here.
126
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

2. Press the trackwheel and choose Filter from the MemoPad menu.
A screen appears that lists all the available categories. By default,
BlackBerry gives you Personal and Business categories. Assuming you
created Project Vulcan category from Tasks, you see a list as shown in
Figure 6-6.
3. To define a new category, press the trackwheel and choose New from
the MemoPad menu.
A New Category screen appears with a text field.
4. Enter the category name in the text field and then press the trackwheel.
The new category name appears in the list of category names.
5. Close the screen by pressing the ENTER key or the trackwheel.
Assigning a category
You can assign categories to your notes when you create a new memo, or you
can edit an existing memo. Either way, the steps are the same. Follow these
steps on editing a memo to assign a category:
1. In MemoPad, highlight the memo you want to edit, press the track-
wheel, and choose Edit from the menu that appears.
2. Press the trackwheel again and choose Categories from the menu that
appears.
3. From the list of categories that appears, use the trackwheel to high-
light the category you want; then press the SPACE key.
The highlighted category is checked. You can check as many categories
as you want.
4. Press the trackwheel and choose Save from the menu that appears
The Note screen returns. Although the assignment is now on your
memo, it doesn’t stay until you save the note itself.
Figure 6-6:
Choose a
category
here.
127
Chapter 6: Making Notes and Calculations

5. Press the trackwheel and choose Save from the menu.
Your note is saved, attached to the category you chose.
If you’re working in MemoPad and you decide to delete a category, remember
that you lose that category in the other applications as well — Address Book,
for example — and with it, all of its assignments. (The Address Book contact
is still intact, but it is missing the category assignment.)
Filtering the list
Time to see just how easy MemoPad can make your life. Finding a note that
belongs to a category (see the preceding section on assigning a note cate-
gory) is just a trackwheel press away. To filter your notes list for a certain
category, follow these steps:
1. Highlight the MemoPad application in the Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
MemoPad opens.
2. Press the trackwheel and choose Filter from the menu.
A screen appears with all the available categories.
3. Use the trackwheel to navigate to the category you want, press the
trackwheel to highlight that category, and then choose Change Option
from the menu.
Your filtered list appears. Note that the list now has the category name
as the heading, as shown in Figure 6-7.

Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Printing notes
Okay, you got us. Out of the box, you can’t exactly print notes directly from
your BlackBerry. However, there is a way. Many companies answered the call
to fill the need; and if you search for a BlackBerry printer online, you see hit
after hit. Some solutions are available:
 Third-party applications (Bluetooth): You install a commercial applica-
tion such as Content Beamer from www.thinprint.com to your
BlackBerry. Such applications use a Bluetooth connection to a printer
that also works with Bluetooth.
 Third-party applications (Internet/e-mail based): A server-based appli-
cation that connects to your e-mail server, it prints any e-mail attach-
ments. In your BlackBerry, you have to install an application allowing
you to send the command to print. A sample of such an application is
PocketWhere for BlackBerry at www.printeron.net.
 Through your desktop PIM software: Even if you buy an application
that allows you to send a command that prints from your BlackBerry,
you still need a computer somewhere to process that command. Having
the Bluetooth option for printing is very convenient. If you’re cost con-
scious, however, and don’t want to spend more, the best way is to sync
your device with an application such as Outlook or Outlook Express,
which feature an equivalent MemoPad-type application that you can
sync with BlackBerry MemoPad. From that desktop application, you can
then print your notes. In Chapter 11, we describe in detail how to con-
nect your BlackBerry to a desktop computer and sync information
between your BlackBerry and your desktop application.
The Calculator
Sure, calculators are everywhere and readily accessible. You can find them
on day planners, wristwatches, cellphones, and a variety of gizmos. However,
how many devices do you want to have to tote? If you had to choose just one,
you’d likely pick your cellphone or (because you’re reading this book) your
BlackBerry. Always at the ready, BlackBerry has Calculator.
Of course, Calculator performs just like you’d expect a calculator to, but stick
with us to see how easily you can use Calculator to convert between metric
and English measurement systems. And finally, we introduce shortcuts that
make using the BlackBerry Calculator a breeze.
129
Chapter 6: Making Notes and Calculations

Accessing Calculator
Locating the BlackBerry Calculator is easy. With very little variations
between models, you should be able to find it easily. For most of the models
except the 7100 series, you can find the Calculator right on the Home screen.
You can easily pick it out because it looks like an old-fashioned calculator, as
shown on the right of Figure 6-8.
Research In Motion did a little organization on the 7100 series. Instead of
placing Calculator on the Home screen, RIM bundled it within a new group
called Applications. The image used for Calculator on the 7100 series is a
little different, too, but it also looks like an old-fashioned calculator. The left
screen in Figure 6-8 shows exactly what we’re describing. (The T-Mobile
theme decided to go for the adding machine look.)
Just like other BlackBerry applications, opening Calculator is a simple matter of
highlighting its name and pressing the trackwheel or pressing the ENTER key.
Using Calculator
Calculator has that standard numberpad look that you’re used to, as shown
in Figure 6-9. Of course, you can do basic arithmetic operations. Use the
trackwheel to navigate or highlight the displayed keys in Calculator. Turning
the trackwheel moves the highlighted keys either left or right, depending on
the direction you’re turning. Turning clockwise moves left to right; after you
reach the far right key on that row, you jump to the far left key on the row
below it. On the bottom-right key, navigating like this takes you to the top-
most row. The opposite behavior happens when you turn the trackwheel
counterclockwise. Go figure.
Figure 6-8:
Access
Calculator
here.
130
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Turning the trackwheel while pressing the ALT key (it’s located in the bottom
left on the keyboard) makes the direction of the scroll vertical instead of 
horizontal. 
To do a simple arithmetic operation, like dividing 24.5 by 4, follow along:
1. Highlight Calculator and press the trackwheel.
Calculator opens.
2. Scroll to highlight the first digit of the first numeral — in this case, 
2 — and press the trackwheel.
That numeral appears in the numeral field of the Calculator screen.
3. If necessary (for a numeral with more than one digit), highlight and
press the trackwheel for the remainder of the numeral (highlight and
press each: 4, a period, and a 5, for this example).
The complete numeral appears in the numeral field of the Calculator
screen (24.5).
4. Scroll to highlight the operator sign you want (here, the division sign
[÷ ]) and press the trackwheel.
You won’t see any changes onscreen. At this point, you’re only telling
Calculator that the next number you’re going to enter is an operand.
5. Scroll to highlight the individual digits of your second numeral and
press the trackwheel per digit.
The second numeral (here, 4) appears in the numeral field.
6. Scroll to highlight the equal sign (=) and press the trackwheel.
You see the results of the operation — 6.125, for this example.

Chapter 6: Making Notes and Calculations

You’ll undoubtedly note some nonnumeric keys in Calculator. Of course,
there are the standard C (Clear) and CE (Clear Entry) keys, but here’s the
scoop on the others:
 MC: Memory Clear; clears the contents of the register
 MR: Memory Recall; reaches to the register and uses the number stored
there
 MS: Memory Save; saves to the register
 M+: Memory Plus; adds a number to the register
 1/x: Invert multiplication (1 divided by the entered number)
Converting between English 
and metric systems
When you’re faced with an unfamiliar measurement system — say liters
versus gallons or miles versus kilometers — you’ll probably need help con-
verting from one measurement system to another. Conveniently enough, your
BlackBerry Calculator can help you. From its menu, you can quickly convert
measurements from English to metric or vice versa.
Display the conversion menu via the MENU key on the Calculator screen.
(Refer to Figure 6-9.) As an example, to convert 20 kilometers to miles, just
follow these steps:
1. Highlight Calculator from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
Calculator opens.
2. Scroll to highlight the first digit of the first numeral (2, in this exam-
ple) and press the trackwheel; scroll to highlight each remaining
digits (0, in this example) and press the trackwheel.
Your first numeral (20, here) appears in the numeral field of the
Calculator screen. This is the number you want to convert (from kilome-
ters to miles for this example).
3. Press the trackwheel again.
The menu screen appears, as shown in Figure 6-10.
132
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

4. Scroll to highlight the From Metric menu item and press the trackwheel.
The menu screen with the conversion choices displays, as shown in
Figure 6-11. Table 6-1 displays these conversion units.
How the arrows point tells you the direction of the conversion. If you
select To Metric compared with From Metric (as in this example), the
metrics listing switches to the right of the arrow.
5. Highlight km →mi from the menu and press the trackwheel.
The screen displays the results of the conversion — 12.427424, in 
this case.

Using Calculator shortcuts
If you use the BlackBerry Calculator, you’re likely exasperated from the
tediousness of using the trackwheel to enter the numbers and the operators.
We understand, and we feel your pain. And we’re here to help by letting you
in on our little secret — Calculator keyboard shortcuts.
Most of the keys you see on the Calculator screen — numbers and operators
or the equal sign — have a one-key shortcut. By spending a little bit of time
practicing and familiarizing these shortcuts, you can use Calculator with
ease. Table 6-2 gives you a detailed mapping as to what these are. Note:
These shortcuts are applicable on the classic Calculator screen, which is
common on most models of the BlackBerry (the 8700 series is an exception
here). From Table 6-2, you should have a pretty good idea how to do an arith-
metic operation with the same speed as on a traditional calculator. The first
column is the key you enter, and the second column is the shortcut. The
third column gives you a tip on how to remember the shortcut.
On the newer 7100 series, the Calculator screen is probably not the classic
screen, but the shortcuts are much easier to deduce. The Calculator screen
actually looks exactly like the layout of the keys, and each key maps to the
actual key on the screen based on its location.
In Calculator, you don’t have to press ALT to produce a number.

Chapter 6: Making Notes and Calculations

Just to give a quick demonstration of this shortcut, say you want to multiply
35 by 25.7. Instead of using the trackwheel, use the one-key shortcuts. Follow
these steps:
1. Highlight Calculator from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
Calculator opens.
2. On your BlackBerry keyboard — not the Calculator number pad —
press the digits of your first numeral (3 and then 5, for this example).
You see the first numeral (35) at the top of the screen.
3. Press the operator shortcut key (refer to Table 6-2).
In this case, press A (the * key on the BlackBerry keyboard, not the
times sign of Calculator).
4. Press the digits of the second numeral, using M as the decimal point if
necessary.
Pressing M enters the decimal point. For this example, you press 2, 5, M,
and 7 to enter 25.7.
You see the second numeral (25.7) onscreen.
5. Press ENTER.
This tells Calculator to do the arithmetic operation you specify. After
pressing ENTER, you see the result (here, 899.5).
As you can see, using Calculator keyboard shortcuts is a simple one-key oper-
ation, just like using a traditional calculator. Try checking out the other short-
cuts; they’re easy to remember after you try them a couple of times.

ere’s the good stuff — using your BlackBerry for
e-mail (Chapter 7), text messaging (Chapter 8),
going online and Web surfing (Chapter 9), and making
those all-important phone calls (Chapter 10).

Chapter 7
You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
In This Chapter
 Linking your e-mail accounts to your BlackBerry
 Mastering e-mail basics
 Searching your e-mail
 Saving messages
Your BlackBerry brings a fresh new face to the convenience and ease-of-use
that we associate with e-mail. You can direct mail to your BlackBerry
from up to ten e-mail accounts from the likes of AOL, Yahoo!, and so on. You
can then set up an e-mail signature, filters, and auto-reply messages — all
covered in this chapter.
In an enterprise world, you can’t link your other e-mail accounts (unless your
company allows that), but you can set up the same options as covered in this
chapter, with the added perk of being able to do so via your BlackBerry with-
out using a PC. Of course, you can also configure your e-mail settings by
using the BlackBerry Desktop Manager. (See Chapter 11 for details on using
BlackBerry Desktop Manager.)
In this chapter, we cover how you can use and manage the mail capabilities
of your BlackBerry to their full potential. From set up to sorts, we’ve got you
covered here.
Getting Up and Running with E-Mail
Regardless who your network service provider is (T-Mobile/Rogers/Vodafone),
you can set up your BlackBerry to receive mail from at least one of your cur-
rent e-mail accounts. Thus, with whatever address you use to send and
receive e-mail from your PC (company e-mail, Yahoo!, AOL, and so on), you
can hook up your BlackBerry to use that same e-mail address. Instead of
checking your Yahoo! e-mail at the Yahoo! site, for example, you can now get
it on your BlackBerry.

Most network service providers allow you to connect up to ten e-mail
accounts to your BlackBerry. This provides you with the convenience of one
central point from which you get all your e-mail without having to log into
multiple e-mail accounts. Such convenience!
In an enterprise environment, you can’t access the BlackBerry Internet
Service site to link your personal e-mail accounts into your BlackBerry, but
you can still configure e-mail settings (such as BlackBerry e-mail filter and
BlackBerry e-mail reconciliation) to make your e-mail experience that much
better. If you’re an Enterprise user, please skip to the parts where you see the
Enterprise icon for configuring your e-mail settings. If you haven’t set up
e-mail on your company-owned BlackBerry, see the upcoming section,
“Setting up e-mail in an enterprise environment.”
Using the BlackBerry 
Internet Service client
You can pull together all your e-mail accounts into one — easily — by using
the BlackBerry Internet Service client (former known as BlackBerry Web
Client), which allows you to
 Manage up to ten e-mail accounts. You can combine up to ten of your
e-mail accounts onto your BlackBerry. See the upcoming section,
“Combining your e-mail accounts into one.”
 Use wireless e-mail reconciliation. No more trying to match your
BlackBerry e-mail against e-mail in your combined account(s). Just turn
on wireless e-mail reconciliation, and you’re good to go. For more on
this, see the upcoming section, “Enabling wireless reconciliation.”
 Specify a Sent From Address for outgoing e-mail. If you have more than
one e-mail account, you can specify which account a sent e-mail goes to.
The upcoming section “Setting your Sent From address” goes into more
detail on this.
 Create e-mail filters. You can filter e-mails so that you get only those
e-mail messages that you truly care about on your BlackBerry. See the
section “Filtering your e-mail” near the end of this chapter.
Think of the BlackBerry Internet Service client (Service client) as another online
e-mail account, like Yahoo! Mail. And just like Yahoo! Mail, the BlackBerry
Internet Service client has an e-mail inbox where e-mail is stored. The Service
client’s inbox looks and feels like any other online e-mail account. Yet, unlike
other online e-mail accounts, Service client is directly connected to your
BlackBerry. This means that if you delete an e-mail on your BlackBerry, that
same e-mail is also deleted in the inbox on the BlackBerry Internet Service
client. (Read about wireless e-mail reconciliation later in this chapter.)
140
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

Combining your e-mail accounts into one
In order to start aggregating e-mail accounts (like Yahoo! Mail) onto your
BlackBerry, you must first run a setup from the BlackBerry Internet Service
client. You can access the Service client from your BlackBerry or from your
desktop computer.
To access the Service client from your PC, you need the URL that is specific
to your network service. Since we can’t be sure which service provider
you’ve chosen, the best thing would be for you to contact it directly for the
URL that is specific to your service.
After you enter your service provider’s Web address in your Web browser,
the Service client asks you to log in, as shown in Figure 7-1.
If this is your first time logging into the Service client, you need to first register
and then create a user ID and password for the Service client. After you log on
to the Service client, you see a screen from which you can access your e-mail
inbox as well as perform various other tasks, discussed throughout this book.
At the top of the BlackBerry Internet Service client, as shown in Figure 7-2, you
can see a toolbar with the following options and their functions:
 Search: Search for e-mail within your e-mail folders.
 Filters: Manage different ways to filter your e-mail. (Here you can specify
which e-mail goes to your BlackBerry and which doesn’t, for example.)
Figure 7-1:
Set up an
e-mail
account
here.
141
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

 Auto Reply: Set a reply that automatically goes to senders. For example,
you can use this setting to create an Out of Office auto-reply e-mail.
 Options: Set up your e-mail signature here. You can also set up a Reply
To address here. (Use a Reply To address when you don’t want your
recipients to reply to the address you’re sending an e-mail from.)
 Profile: Manage your e-mail accounts and set your Sent From address
from here.
Note that your BlackBerry already has an e-mail address with which you can
receive and send e-mail. If you don’t have any other e-mail account that you
want to meld into your BlackBerry e-mail account, simply skip to the upcom-
ing “Setting your Sent From address” section.

Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 
Finding your service provider’s URL
To access the Service client from your PC, you
need the Web address that is specific to your
network service. Please contact your network
service provider (T-Mobile, Verizon, and so on)
directly to get the URL that is specific to your
service.

Adding an e-mail account
You can have up to ten e-mail accounts on your BlackBerry — this is the
good stuff right here. To add an e-mail account to your BlackBerry account
1. From the toolbar of the BlackBerry Internet Service client (refer to
Figure 7-2), click Profile.
You see the Profile screen, from which you can manage your e-mail
accounts.
2. From the Profile screen, click the Other Email Accounts link (under
the Email Accounts heading).
You can see the e-mail address(es) that your BlackBerry receives e-mail
from. If this is the first time that you’re setting up an e-mail account, you
see only one e-mail address, which is your BlackBerry e-mail address.
3. From the Email Accounts screen, click the Add Account button.
You are prompted to enter the following information:
• The e-mail address from which you want to receive e-mail: for
example, myid@yahoo.com
• The account login you use to log into this particular e-mail account
• The password you use associated with the login
4. Click the Submit button.
You see the Email Accounts screen listing your newly added e-mail
address.
If you don’t see this screen, here are some hints as to what’s wrong:
• You might have to enable POP Forwarding on the e-mail account
you’re try to receive e-mail from (for example, a Yahoo! e-mail
account).
• You didn’t enter your information properly.
You can also manage your accounts from your BlackBerry. Scroll to the Setup
Email application (that you use to open a BlackBerry Browser session), and
the rest is pretty much the same on the BlackBerry compared with a PC.
We suggest that you first register and create your account using your PC. Then
for your subsequent visits to the BlackBerry Internet Service client, you can
use your BlackBerry. This way, you can minimize any errors or out-of-network
coverage issues while setting up your account.
143
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

Setting up e-mail in an 
enterprise environment
This section is intended for those whose BlackBerry can’t receive and send
e-mail yet — like when you first get your BlackBerry, or you swap an old one
for a new one. If your e-mail function works properly on your BlackBerry, you
can skip this section.
To activate your BlackBerry for enterprise use
1. From the Home screen on your BlackBerry, scroll to Enterprise
Activation and press the trackwheel.
The Enterprise Activation screen opens, which has but two fields for you
to fill in:
• Your corporate e-mail: for example, myaccount@abcCompany.com
• The password for enterprise activation
2. Type in your corporate e-mail account along with the appropriate
password.
If you don’t know these pieces of information, contact your corporate
system administrator.
3. Press the trackwheel and choose Activate from the contextual menu.
Your BlackBerry attempts to activate your BlackBerry with your 
corporation.
Some corporations don’t allow any employee-purchased BlackBerry to be
activated with corporate e-mail. Check with your system administrator on
corporate BlackBerry policies. Keep in mind as well that BlackBerry
Enterprise Server version 4.0 is required for enterprise activation.
Customizing Your E-Mail
Within this section, we go over the details of the following e-mail configurations:
 Setting your Sent From address: This allows you to customize the
e-mail address that your e-mail recipients see when they get an e-mail
from you.
 Enabling wireless e-mail reconciliation: After enabling e-mail reconcili-
ation, whatever you see on your BlackBerry is what you get on your
144
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

e-mail account(s). You no longer have to double-delete a message in
both your BlackBerry and your e-mail account(s).
 Configuring auto-replies: Whether you are out of the office or just want
a quick response message sent to your senders, this is where you can
specify the message they see.
 Configuring e-mail signature: If you’re tired of writing Regards, John
Smith over and over to close an e-mail, set an e-mail signature.
Setting your Sent From address
If you add more than one e-mail account into your BlackBerry e-mail account,
you’re probably wondering which e-mail address shows up when you send an
e-mail. The folks at Research In Motion (RIM) are a step ahead of you and
already have solutions to your question.
From BlackBerry Internet Service client, you can change your Sent From
address from your BlackBerry e-mail address to any added e-mail
address(es). Here’s how.
1. Log on to the Service client.
2. From the BlackBerry Internet Service client toolbar (refer to Figure 7-2),
click Profile.
3. From the Profile screen, click the Sent From Address option.
The Sent From Address screen appears (see Figure 7-3), from which you
can choose from the following:
• Have the Sent From address be the BlackBerry handheld address.
• Choose from one of the aggregated address(es). (See the drop-
down list there.) If you haven’t added any other e-mail account into
your BlackBerry account, this option is unavailable.
• Customize your Sent From address to any address that you type in.
4. Confirm your selection by clicking the Submit button.
This change is effective immediately after you click Submit. You can test
your selection by sending someone or yourself a quick test e-mail from
your BlackBerry and verifying from which e-mail address the BlackBerry
sent it.
145
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

Enabling wireless reconciliation
Whatever e-mail you see on your BlackBerry is also what you see on your
Service client inbox (except for any mail that you filtered; see the later sec-
tion on filtering). This way, you don’t need to delete the same e-mail in two
places: The two e-mail inboxes reconcile with each other, hence the term
wireless reconciliation. Convenient, huh?
Enabling wireless deletion
Enabling wireless deletion allows you to delete an e-mail from your
BlackBerry and have that deletion happen on the Service client inbox as well.
When you do so, the e-mail is moved to the Deleted folder.
To enable wireless deletion
1. From the toolbar in the BlackBerry Internet Service client, click Profile.
2. From the Profile screen, select the Wireless Delete Option link.
You’re prompted with a simple check box to enable or disable the wire-
less delete option.
3. Select the check box to enable the wireless delete option.
Wireless reconciliation is enabled.
4. Confirm your changes by clicking Save.
Figure 7-3:
Set your
Sent From
address
here.
146
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

Enabling the wireless delete option on BlackBerry Internet Service client is a
first step toward wireless reconciliation. Second, you also need to enable
wireless reconciliation on your handheld. To do so, see the next section.
Enabling wireless e-mail synchronization
After you enable this option on the BlackBerry Internet Service client, you
can start wireless e-mail synchronization by configuring your BlackBerry:
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
2. Press the trackwheel and choose Options.
This brings up the Options screen, which contains two option types:
General Options and Email Reconciliation.
3. From the Options screen, scroll to Email Reconciliation and press the
trackwheel.
4. On the Email Reconciliation screen are three options:
• Delete On: This option configures how BlackBerry handles your
e-mail deletion.
• Wireless Reconciliation: This option turns on or off the wireless
sync function.
• On Conflict: This option controls how BlackBerry handles inconsis-
tency between e-mail on your BlackBerry versus BlackBerry
Internet Service client.
You can choose who “wins” via this option: your BlackBerry or the
BlackBerry Internet Service client.
5. Scroll to Delete On, press the trackwheel, and choose from
• Handheld: A delete on your BlackBerry takes effect on your
BlackBerry only.
• Mailbox & Handheld: A delete on your BlackBerry takes effect on
both your BlackBerry and your inbox on BlackBerry Internet
Service client.
• Prompt: This option prompts your BlackBerry to ask you at the
time of deletion.
6. Scroll to Wireless Reconciliation, press the trackwheel, and choose On.
7. Scroll to On Conflict, press the trackwheel, and choose how to deal
with inconsistencies.
A conflict occurs when the number of e-mails on your handheld does not
match your actual e-mail account(s) because you deleted e-mail on your
handheld (or on your e-mail account) and not the other.
147
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

You can choose
• Mailbox Wins
• Handheld Wins
If you choose Handheld Wins, the e-mail on your e-mail account
will match the ones on the Handheld.
Permanently deleting e-mail from your BlackBerry
In addition, when deleting e-mail on your BlackBerry, the same message in
the BlackBerry Internet Service client is placed in the Deleted folder. You can
set up your BlackBerry to permanently delete e-mail, but use this option with
caution — after that e-mail is gone, it’s gone. The upside is that you save space
more efficiently, considering that you’re allotted only 18MB of space for e-mail.
To permanently delete e-mail on your Service client from your BlackBerry,
follow these steps:
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
2. Press the trackwheel and choose Options.
This brings up the Options screen, which contains two option types:
• General Options
• Email Reconciliation
3. From the Options screen, scroll to Email Reconciliation and press the
trackwheel.
4. From the Email Reconciliation screen, press the trackwheel and
choose Purge Deleted Items.
A pop-up appears confirming that you are about to purge deleted e-mails
on your Service client.
5. From the pop-up menu, choose Yes.
Deleted e-mails in your Service client are purged.
Automating replies and 
Out of Office messages
Setting an auto-reply for your e-mail is quite easy on the BlackBerry Internet
Service client. Whether you need to acknowledge incoming e-mail to senders
or set up an Out of Office reply, you can set it up via the BlackBerry Internet
Service client.
148
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

First log on to the Service client.
1. From the toolbar in the BlackBerry Internet Service client, click Auto
Reply. (Refer to Figure 7-2.)
The Auto Reply screen appears, which has a text box where you can
type in your auto-reply message.
2. From the Auto Reply screen, type in the auto-reply message you want
your e-mail senders to see.
If you’re setting an Out of Office message, inform your senders the dates
that you will be out and when they can expect you to respond.
To be a little more coy about your schedule, use something simple, like
“Thanks for your e-mail. I will send a response as soon as I can.”
3. Confirm your auto-reply message by clicking Save.
After you set an Out of Office reply message, don’t forget to turn it off. Just
clear the message text box when you return.
You also can set an auto-reply directly on your BlackBerry. Here are the steps:
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
The Messages application opens; look for the message list of e-mail.
2. Press the trackwheel and choose Options.
3. From the Options screen, scroll to Email Settings and press the 
trackwheel.
4. From the list of e-mail setting options, scroll to the Use Out Of Office
Reply field, press the trackwheel, and choose Yes.
Auto Reply is enabled.
5. Type your auto-reply message in the text box.
6. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackwheel and then choosing
Save from the contextual menu.
Configuring your e-mail signature
When you’re on the go, every letter you type on your BlackBerry takes away
your valuable time. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could avoid typing the same
ending to every e-mail: You know, Regards, John Smith. To the rescue, Email
Signature can save you some precious minutes of your day while writing
e-mail.
149
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

The set up is quite simple, almost similar to using Auto Reply. Log on to the
Service client and follow these steps:
1. From the toolbar of the BlackBerry Internet Service client, click Options.
The Options screen opens, with (um) options in addition to configuring
your e-mail signature. (We focus only on e-mail signature here.)
For other configuration, refer to the Help section on the toolbar.
2. Under the Email Identification section, enter your e-mail signature in
the text box.
A typical e-mail signature is Regards, YourName. Of course, you can add
anything else you want, like contact info or any personal message.
3. Select the Yes check box to include an auto-signature in outgoing 
messages.
If you don’t select Yes, your signature text is not included in outgoing
e-mail from your BlackBerry.
4. Confirm your signature by clicking OK.
If you work in an enterprise environment, you might need to perform these
steps directly on your BlackBerry. Keep in mind that you can set up an e-mail
signature on your BlackBerry only if your company is on the BlackBerry
Enterprise Server (BES) 4.0. Check with your BlackBerry system administra-
tor to see what version of BES your company uses.
Here’s how:
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
When Messages opens, you see a list of e-mails (the message list).
2. Press the trackwheel and choose Options.
3. From the Options screen, scroll to Email Settings and press the 
trackwheel.
4. When prompted with list of e-mail setting options, scroll to the Use
Auto Signature field, press the trackwheel, and choose Yes.
Doing so enables your e-mail signature and displays your message at the
end of every outgoing e-mail.
5. Type in your e-mail signature in the text box.
6. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackwheel and choosing Save
from the contextual menu.
150
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

Accessing Messages
From Messages, you send and receive your e-mails and also configure 
wireless e-mail reconciliation with your BlackBerry Enterprise Server. (To
access Messages, go to the Home screen, scroll to Messages, and press the
trackwheel.)
The first thing you see after opening Messages is the message list. Your mes-
sage list can contain e-mail, voice mail messages, missed phone call notices,
Short Messaging Service (SMS) messages, and even saved Web pages.
Receiving e-mails
Whether you’re concerned about security or speed of delivery, with
BlackBerry’s up-to-date secured network, you’re in good hands when receiv-
ing e-mail on your BlackBerry.
And whether you’ve aggregated accounts or just use the plain vanilla
BlackBerry e-mail account, you receive your e-mail the same way. When you
receive an e-mail, your BlackBerry notifies you by displaying a numeral next
to a mail icon (an envelope) at the top of the screen. This number represents
how many new (unread) e-mails you have. See Figure 7-4.
Your BlackBerry can also notify you of new e-mail by vibration and/or a
sound alert. You can customize this from Profiles, as we detail in Chapter 2.
Figure 7-4:
You’ve got
(7) e-mails!
151
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

Retrieving e-mail
Retrieving your e-mail is simple:
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
Doing so opens the Messages application; you see your message list.
2. From the message list, scroll to an e-mail — unopened or opened or
sent; it doesn’t matter — and press ENTER.
You can tell whether an e-mail is unopened by the small unopened enve-
lope icon on the left side of the e-mail. A read e-mail bears an opened
envelope icon, and a sent e-mail has a check mark as its icon.
3. After you finish reading the message, press ESC to return to message list.
As Step 2 indicates, your message list can contain unopened, opened, sent.
You can even find e-mail drafts there. Also, you can organize the list to have
either just incoming or just sent e-mails. Read on.
Sorting the message list
The BlackBerry lists items in order by the date and time they are received,
but you can sort by different criteria. For example, to see the next unread
message, press the appropriate hot key (ALT+U; ALT+I on 72xx models).
Sorting and searching are closely related on your BlackBerry. In a sense,
searching is really sorting your e-mail based on your search criteria. On the
BlackBerry, you can search your e-mail specifically by the name of the sender
or by keywords. Or, you could run a search as broad as looking through all
the e-mail that has been sent to you. See the later section, “Searching through
Your Messages Like a Pro,” for more on searching and sorting. For more pre-
defined hot keys, see the upcoming section, “Reusing saved search results.”
Saving a message to the saved folder
You can save any important e-mail into a folder so you can easily find it with-
out sorting through tons of e-mail. To do so, simply scroll to the e-mail you
want to save, press the trackwheel, scroll to the Save option from the contex-
tual menu, and press the trackwheel once more. A pop-up message screen
confirms that your e-mails have been saved. Note: Your saved e-mails will still
remain in the message list.
To retrieve/view a saved e-mail, follow these steps:
1. On a non-7100 Series, highlight the Saved Messages icon from the
BlackBerry Home screen and then press the trackwheel.
2. From the saved messages list that appears, scroll to find your saved
message.
3. Open it by pressing the trackwheel once and then selecting Open
from the contextual menu.
152
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

On most 7100 models, you can get to the saved message list from Messages.
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
2. With the messages list open, press the trackwheel and choose View
Saved Messages.
3. From the saved message list that appears, scroll to find the saved 
message.
4. Open it by pressing the trackwheel and then selecting Open from the
contextual menu.
Viewing attachments
Your BlackBerry is so versatile. So versatile, in fact, that you can view most
e-mail attachments on it just like you can on a desktop PC. And we’re talking
sizeable attachments, too, like JPEGs (photos), Word docs, PowerPoint
slides, and Excel spreadsheets. Table 7-1 has a list of supported attachment
viewable from your BlackBerry.
However versatile your BlackBerry is, you cannot create attachments without
help from third-party software. Please refer to Chapter 17 for a productivity
program that can help you create Word docs and Excel spreadsheets right
from your BlackBerry and attach them in an e-mail for you to send out.

To tell whether an e-mail has an attachment, look for the standard paperclip
icon next to your e-mail in the message list.
You retrieve all the different types of attachments the same way. This makes
retrieving attachments an easy task. To open an attachment, follow along:
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
2. From the message list, scroll to an e-mail that has a paperclip next to it
and then press ENTER.
3. From the open e-mail, press the trackwheel and choose Open
Attachment.
You see a screen containing the name of the file, a Table of Contents
option, and a Full Contents option. For MS Word documents, you can see
different headings in outline form in the Table of Contents option. For
picture files, like a JPEG, you can simply go straight to the Full Contents
option to see the graphic.
No matter what the file type is — as long it is supported — you see Table
of Contents and Full Contents as options. Depending on the file type, use
your judgment on when you should use the Table of Contents option.
4. Scroll to the Full Contents option, press the trackwheel, and choose
Retrieve.
Your BlackBerry attempts to contact the network to retrieve your
attachment. This retrieves only part of your attachment. As you peruse
a document, BlackBerry retrieves more as you scroll through the attach-
ment. When you’re retrieving a picture, the network shows all the
attachment at once.
Sending e-mail
The first thing you probably want to do when you get your BlackBerry is to
write an e-mail to let your friends know that you’ve just gotten a BlackBerry.
154
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
2. From the message list, press the trackwheel and choose Compose
Email from the contextual menu.
You are prompted to select a contact from your Address Book.
3. Enter the contact.
• If you have contacts in your Address Book: Highlight the contact you
want and then press the trackwheel.
• If you don’t yet have any contacts or if the one you want isn’t in your
Address Book: Use the Use Once option to enter the appropriate
e-mail address and press the ENTER key to finish and return to the
Compose Email screen.
4. From the Compose Email screen, type in the subject line and the mes-
sage to send to the recipient.
5. Press the trackwheel and choose Send.
Your message has wings.
Sending e-mail to more than one person
When you need to send an e-mail to more than one person, just keep adding
recipient names as needed. You can also add recipient names to receive a CC
(carbon copy) or BCC (blind carbon copy). Here’s how:
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
2. From the messages list, press the trackwheel and choose Compose
Email from the contextual menu.
3. When prompted, highlight a contact from your Address Book and
press the trackwheel to choose that.
• If you have contacts in your Address Book: Highlight the contact you
want and then press the trackwheel.
• If you don’t yet have any contacts or if the one you want isn’t in your
Address Book: Use the Use Once option to enter the appropriate
e-mail address and then press the ENTER key to finish and return
to the Compose Email screen.
You return to the Compose Email screen. You now have added the first
recipient for this e-mail, whose name appears in the To field. You now
can add additional recipients to any of the recipient fields (To/CC/BCC).
4. Highlight another contact, press the trackwheel, then press the track-
wheel again and choose Add Cc (or Add To or Add Bcc), as shown on
the left side of Figure 7-5.
The Cc field is filled with this contact’s name in the resulting to-be-
composed message, as shown on the right side of Figure 7-5.
155
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

This returns you to the Address Book to select additional contacts.
5. Highlight the next contact and press the trackwheel to make that
selection.
You are brought back to the Compose Email screen.
6. Add as many additional recipients as needed, repeating Steps 4 and 5.
If you have an e-mail group set up in your Address Book, you can choose
to e-mail that group as a whole. This is a very efficient way of mass
e-mailing from your BlackBerry that can save you valuable time. Read
about creating and maintaining groups in Chapter 3.
7. From the Compose Email screen, type in the subject and message you
wish to send to your recipients.
8. Press the trackwheel and choose Send.
Your mass message is on its way.
In addition to Add Cc (carbon copy), you can also use Add To and/or Add
Bcc (blind carbon copy) to your e-mail recipient list.
Replying to an e-mail
Replying to an e-mail couldn’t be much more simple:
1. From an open e-mail (see the earlier section on how to open an
e-mail), press the trackwheel and choose Reply.
This opens a compose screen in which you can type your reply. You can
still see the original message beneath your reply. This is similar to the
Compose Email screen, with addition of the original e-mail that you are
replying to.
Figure 7-5:
Add CC and
BCC names
like so.
156
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

2. After you finish typing your reply message, press the trackwheel and
choose Send.
This message is sent.
If an incoming e-mail was sent to a group of people and you want to reply to
all the recipients, choose Reply to All instead of Reply (Step 1).
Forwarding e-mail
When you need to share an important e-mail that you just received with col-
leagues or friends, you can forward that e-mail. To forward an e-mail message:
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
2. From the messages list, scroll to an e-mail and press ENTER.
3. With the e-mail open, press the trackwheel and choose Forward.
4. When prompted, highlight a contact and press the trackwheel to
select that contact from your Address Book.
• If you have contacts in your Address Book: Highlight the contact you
want and press the trackwheel.
• If you don’t yet have any contacts or if the one you want isn’t in your
Address Book: Use the Use Once option to enter the appropriate
e-mail address and the press the ENTER key to finish and return to
the Compose Email screen.
You return to the Compose Email screen.
To forward a message to more than one person — or to a group — see
the preceding section.
5. (Optional) From the Compose Email screen, type in a note.
6. Press the trackwheel and choose Send.
Your message is on its way to your recipient(s).
Saving a draft e-mail
Sometimes the most skillful wordsmiths find themselves lost for words to
express the message they want. Don’t fret, fellow wordsmith, you can save
that e-mail composition as a draft until your words come back to you.
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
2. From the message list, press the trackwheel and choose Compose
Email from the contextual menu.
You are prompted to select a contact from your Address Book.
157
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

3. When prompted, highlight a contact from your Address Book and
press the trackwheel.
• If you have contacts in your Address Book: Highlight the contact you
want and press the trackwheel.
• If you don’t yet have any contacts or if the one you want isn’t in your
Address Book: Use the Use Once option to enter the appropriate
e-mail address and then press the ENTER key to finish and return
to the Compose Email screen.
You return to the Compose Email screen.
4. Type in the subject line and message you wish to send.
5. Press the trackwheel and choose Save Draft.
This saves your e-mail as a draft. When you’re ready to send your mes-
sage, choose the draft from the message list. You can tell which mes-
sages are drafts because they sport a tiny Document icon; received
messages have an envelope icon while sent messages have a checkmark.
See Figure 7-6.
Adding a sender to your Address Book
You can add a message-sender’s contact info to your BlackBerry Address
Book directly from Messages. You don’t even have to copy or jot down the
person’s name and e-mail address on paper. Sweet.
To add a sender to your Address Book
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
2. In the message list, scroll to an e-mail and press ENTER.
Figure 7-6:
Your
message list

158
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

3. In the open e-mail, scroll the cursor to the sender’s name, press the
trackwheel, and then choose Add to Address Book.
The New Address screen opens.
The sender’s first name, last name, and e-mail address are automatically
transferred to your Address Book.
4. (Optional) If needed, add additional contact information.
Because the only information that is automatically transferred is name
and e-mail address, you can add other info about the contact, such as a
phone number and mailing address.
5. Press the trackwheel and choose save.
Your new contact is in your Address Book.
Deleting e-mail
Keeping your message list tidy can help you stay organized and reduce the
amount of memory your e-mail takes. Cull those messages you no longer
need by following these steps:
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
2. In the message list, scroll to the e-mail you want to delete, press the
trackwheel, and choose Delete.
A deletion confirmation pop-up appears.
3. Choose Delete to confirm your deletion.
The deleted e-mail is toast.
To delete more than one e-mail, press the CAP key and scroll to highlight as
many e-mails as you want. After you make your deletion selections, press the
trackwheel and choose Delete.
You can delete anything (such as an SMS or voice mail) listed in the message
list the same way as you delete an e-mail message.
If you want to really clean up your old e-mails and you don’t want to scroll
through tons of e-mails, you can do the following.
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
2. From the message list, scroll to a horizontal date mark, press the
trackwheel, and choose Delete Prior, as shown in Figure 7-7.
159
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

A pop-up appears, prompting you for delete confirmation.
The date mark is simply a horizontal bar with dates shown. Just like you
can highlight e-mails in the message list, you can also highlight the date
mark.
Before you take the plunge, remember that going ahead will delete all the
e-mails before the particular date mark. There is no way to retrieve deleted
items from your BlackBerry.
3. Choose Delete to confirm your deletion.
All your e-mails prior to the date mark are history.
Filtering your e-mail
Most of us get e-mail that either isn’t urgent or doesn’t really concern us —
you get them because you were on that message’s Cc list. Instead of receiving
them on your BlackBerry — and wasting both time and effort to check them —
you can filter them out. While in the BlackBerry Internet Service client, set up
filters to make your BlackBerry mailbox receive only those e-mails that you
care about. (Don’t worry; you’ll still receive them on your main computer.)
Filtering your e-mail from the Service client
After you log into the Service client
1. From the toolbar in the BlackBerry Internet Service client (refer to
Figure 7-2), click Filters.
The Filter screen that opens shows a list of filters that have been cre-
ated. Place a mark (check) next to the filter you want to use or leave a
filter unmarked if you don’t want to use it.
If you need to create a new filter, read on.
Figure 7-7:
Highlight the
date mark to
do a mass
deletion.
160
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

2. From the Filter screen, click the New button.
The Add Filter screen appears, as shown in Figure 7-8. Here, you can
create a new e-mail filter.
For example, here’s how to create a very simple filter that treats work-related
messages as urgent and forwards them to your BlackBerry. Refer to Figure 7-8
as you follow these steps:
1. From the Add Filter screen (see the preceding steps), enter the filter
name.
We enter WorkUrgent.
The filter name can be anything you like.
2. From the drop-down list beneath the heading When a New Message Has
the Following Conditions, choose the condition you place on the filter:
• Any
• All
For this simple example filter, we choose Any. Choosing Any puts only
one condition on your filter. For other more complex filters, having more
than one condition will alter the outcome of your filter.
Now the conditional sentence on the Add Filter screen reads If <any>
of these conditions are true.
Figure 7-8:
Create a
filter for
your e-mail
here.
161
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

3. From the first condition line, set the first filter criterion.
The first two fields hold
• From: You can choose From/Sent To/Cc/Bcc.
• Contains: You can choose from Contains or Not Contain.
In our example, we set these fields to contain Sent To/Cc and Contains,
respectively.
The third field holds the name of your company address that appears
after an e-mail address.
4. Enter your company’s domain name in the third field of the first crite-
ria line.
For example, if your work e-mail address is myName@XYZCo.com, enter
XYZCo.com.
5. (Optional) If you need to add more conditions to this particular filter,
repeat Steps 3 and 4 until you are satisfied.
You can have only up to four conditions per filter.
6. For the Move to Folder drop-down list box, choose from InBox, Sent
Folder, and Draft Folder.
The condition(s) that you set are applied to the folder that you choose
in this option.
7. From the Handheld section, you can select from two radio buttons:
Forward Messages to Handheld: You can select either or both of the fol-
lowing two check boxes:
• Header Only: Choose this if you want the only the header of the
e-mails that meets the condition(s) you set in Steps 3, 4, and 5 to
be sent to you. (A header doesn’t contain the body of the e-mail —
just whom it was sent from, the subject, and the time it was sent.)
You would choose this if you get automated alerts, where receiving
only the subject is sufficient.
• Level1 Notification: Level1 notification is another way of saying
urgent e-mail. When you receive a Level1 e-mail, it is bold in
Messages.
Do Not Forward Message to Handheld: Selecting this means that any
e-mail that meets the conditions you set in Steps 3, 4, and 5 will not be
sent to your BlackBerry.
8. Confirm your filter by clicking the Save and Close button at the top of
the page.
After confirmation, you return to the Filter screen, where you can see
your newly created filter in the list there.
162
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

If you have a hard time setting the criteria for a filter, just take a best guess and
then test it by having a friend send you a test e-mail. If the test e-mail didn’t get
filtered how you want, retry setting the conditions until you get it right.
Filtering your e-mails via your BlackBerry
Like we mention earlier, in an enterprise environment, you don’t have access
to BlackBerry Internet Service, but that doesn’t meant that you can’t perform
the same function. Functions like filtering are no different. To configure e-mail
filters in enterprise environment, you can do it directly from your BlackBerry:
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
When Messages opens, you see a list of e-mail: the message list.
2. Press the trackwheel and choose Options.
This brings up the Options screen, which lists General Options, Email
Reconciliation, Email Settings, and Email Filters.
3. Scroll to Email Filters and press the trackwheel.
You are prompted with the Email Filters screen, which lists current
e-mail filters. See Figure 7-9.
As you can see from Figure 7-9, two filters are applied, as indicated by
the checks in the check boxes. If you don’t want any filter to run, scroll
to each and press SPACE to toggle the check mark to off.
4. From the Email Filters screen, press the trackwheel and choose New
from the contextual menu.
A new e-mail Filter screen opens from which you can specify how you
want your e-mail filtered. (See Figure 7-10.)
Figure 7-9:
The Email
Filters
screen,
showing list
of current

filters.
163
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

5. Fill in the new Filter screen.
If you want to add a contact to either the From field or the Sent To field,
you cannot simply type in the names. Instead, you have to choose them
from the Address Book. So, scroll to either field, press the trackwheel,
and then choose Select Name.
This takes you to Address Book (where you can choose your contact). 
• If you have contacts in your Address Book: Highlight the contact you
want and then press the trackwheel.
• If you don’t yet have any contacts or if the one you want isn’t in your
Address Book: Use the Use Once option to enter the appropriate
e-mail address and then press the ENTER key to finish and return
to the Compose Email screen.
After you make this selection, choose Continue from Address Book menu.
You return to the Filter screen.
6. Continue to fill in the Filter screen by defining more conditions:
Subject: You can type in any keyword(s) in the subject line that you
want to filter by.
Message: You can type in any keyword(s) in the message body that you
want to filter by.
Sent Directly to Me: Selecting this check box specifies the condition of
an e-mail sent directly to you.
CC to Me: Select this check box to specify the condition of an e-mail that
you are CCed on.
BCC to Me: Select this check box to specify the condition of an e-mail
that is BCCed to you.
Figure 7-10:
New Filter
screen.
164
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

Importance: Choose Normal or Urgent from this drop-down list.
Action: Choose Forward or Do Not Forward from this drop-down list. If
you choose Forward, you have two more check boxes:
• Header Only: Choose this if you want the only the headers of the
e-mails that meet the condition(s) you set to be sent to you.
You would choose this if you get automated alerts, and receiving
only the subject is sufficient.
• Level1 Notification: Level1 notification is another way of saying urgent
e-mail. When you receive a Level1 e-mail, it is bold in Messages.
If you choose Do Not Forward, e-mail that meets the conditions that you
set will not be forwarded to your BlackBerry.
7. When you finish specifying your new filter, confirm your changes by
pressing the trackwheel and choosing Save from the contextual menu.
Saving e-mail
Whether you’re dealing with a travel confirmation or a nice note from your
loved one, sometimes you have important e-mail that you want to keep for a
while. However, leaving a message in your e-mail inbox with incoming e-mail
can make finding your important e-mail difficult. Instead, save and view those
special messages in the Saved folder:
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
2. From the messages list, scroll to the e-mail you want to save, press the
trackwheel, and select Save.
You see a confirmation message, informing you that the message is saved.
You can save any message (an SMS or a voice mail) listed in the messages list
the same way as we describe earlier in this chapter.
Searching through Your 
Messages Like a Pro
Searching is one of those functions you probably won’t use every day — but
when you do run a search, you usually need the information fast. Take a few
minutes here to familiarize yourself with the different ways to search so that
165
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

when you depend on the search function, you know which search method
yields the right results in the shortest amount of time.
Within the BlackBerry Messages application, you have three ways to search
through your messages. Two of the three ways are specific, and one is a
broad search:
 Search by sender/recipient: Specific. This assumes that you already
know the sender or recipient.
 Search by subject: Specific. This assumes that you already know the
subject.
 General search by keyword: Broad. You don’t have a specific assumption.
You can search through anything that is listed within the messages list; that
means that you can search through SMS and voice mail as well as e-mail.
Searching by sender/recipient
Use this option when you’re looking for a specific message from a specific
person. For example, say your brother constantly sends you e-mail (which
means your message list has many entries from him). You’re trying to locate
a message he sent you approximately two weeks ago regarding a fishing trip
location. You’ve scrolled down the message list, but you just can’t seem to
find that message. Or maybe you want to find a message you sent to Sue but
can’t quite lay your hands on it.
To find the message when you know the sender or recipient, follow along:
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
You see the message list.
2. In the message list, use the trackwheel to highlight a message that you
sent to or received from that particular person.
3. After you highlight the message of your choice, press the trackwheel
and then choose one of these options:
• From someone specific: Because that certain someone sent you the
message, choose Search Sender, as shown in Figure 7-11.
166
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

• To someone specific: Because you sent that certain someone the
message, choose Search Recipient.
This starts the search. Any result appears onscreen.
Searching by subject
Use this search option when you’re looking for a specific e-mail titled by a
specific subject that you already know.
As is the case when running a search by sender/recipient, first scroll to an
e-mail bearing by the same specific subject you’re searching for.
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
2. In the message list, use the trackwheel to scroll to any e-mail titled by
the specific subject you’re searching for.
3. While highlighting a message (incoming or outgoing), press the track-
wheel and choose Search Subject.
The search starts, and the result(s) appears onscreen.
Running a general search
A general search is a broad search from which you can perform keyword
searches of your e-mail.
Figure 7-11:
Search your
e-mail by
sender or
recipient.
167
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

To run a general search
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
2. In the messages list, press the trackwheel and choose Search from the
contextual menu.
3. In the Search screen that appears, fill in your search criteria. (See
Figure 7-12.)
The search criteria for a general search are the following:
• Name: This is in the name of the sender or recipient to search by.
• In Field: This is related to the Name criterion. Use this drop-down
to indicate where the name might appear, such as in the To or Cc
field. From the drop-down list, your choices are the From/To/Cc/
Bcc fields.
• Subject: This is where you type in some or all the keywords that
appear in the subject.
• Message: Here you enter keywords that appear in the message.
• Folder: This is the folder in which you want to perform the search.
Generally, have all folders searched.
• Show: This drop-down list specifies how the search result will
appear: namely, whether you want to see only e-mails that you sent
or e-mails that you received. From the drop-down list, your choices
are Sent and Received/Received Only/Sent Only/Saved Only/Draft.
• Type: This drop-down list specifies the type of message that you’re
trying to search for: e-mail, SMS, or voice mail. From the drop-
down list, your choices are All/Email/PIN/SMS/Phone/Voicemail.
Figure 7-12:
The Search
screen in
Messages.
168
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

From the Search screen shown in Figure 7-12, you can have multiple
search criteria or just a single one (up to you); then press the track-
wheel to choose New from the contextual menu. This starts a new
search, erasing any previous settings.
4. Press the trackwheel and choose Search.
The search results appear onscreen.
You can narrow a search results by performing a second search on the initial
results. For example, you can first search by sender and then narrow those
hits by performing a search by subject.
Saving search results
If you find yourself re-searching by using the same criteria over and over, you
can reuse a search by first saving it. Then you can reuse it.
Here’s how. Follow the steps in the preceding section for an outgoing e-mail
search until Step 4. Then
1. Press the trackwheel and choose Save.
This brings up the Search Save screen, from which you can name your
search and assign it a hot key. See Figure 7-13.
A hot key is simply a shortcut that you can use to activate this saved
search result.
Figure 7-13:
Name your
search and
assign a 
hot key.
169
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

2. Enter a name in the Title field.
The title is the name of your search, which appears in the Search Result
screen.
3. Scroll to Shortcut Key field, press the trackwheel, and change this
field to a letter choice from the drop-down list.
You have ten characters to choose from.
Note: On the 7100 Series, you have only ten choices. On other
BlackBerry models, you have more than ten (simply because you have
more keys on BlackBerry models other than the 7100 series).
4. Confirm your saved search by pressing the trackwheel and choos-
ing Save.
Reusing saved search results
Right out of the box, your BlackBerry comes with four saved search results,
which you can see in the Recall screen as shown in the upcoming Figure 7-12.
Any new saved result will make your search that much more robust.
To see the all the saved search results
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
2. From the message list, press the trackwheel and choose Search from
the contextual menu.
3. From the Search screen (refer to Figure 7-12), press the trackwheel
and choose Recall from the contextual menu.
The Recall screen opens, from which you can see the four preloaded
search shortcuts, as shown in Figure 7-14.
To use these search filters, press ALT plus the letter next to the name of the
shortcut. For example, as shown in Figure 7-14, the hot key for an incoming
message is u. So, while in the message list of Messages, you can see the
search result of only incoming e-mails by pressing ALT+U.
These shortcuts are also listed in the last section of this chapter.

Long Live E-Mail
No closet has unlimited space, and your BlackBerry e-mail storage has limits,
too. You’ve likely pondered how long your e-mails are kept in your
BlackBerry. (The default is 30 days. Pshew.) Or what happens if you run out
of space on your BlackBerry? Can you still receive e-mail?
If you want to keep your e-mail for 60 days — or for as long as your
BlackBerry has space for them — the folks at RIM have an e-mail option for
you. You can choose from 15 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, or forever (well,
for as long as your BlackBerry has the space for them).
Because any message you save is kept for as long as you want to, a good way
to make sure you don’t lose an important message is to save it.
To change how long your e-mails live on your BlackBerry
1. Highlight Messages from the BlackBerry Home screen and press the
trackwheel.
The Messages application duly opens for you.
2. Press the trackwheel and choose Options.
This brings up the Options screen, which contains two option types:
General Options and Email Reconciliation.
3. From the Options screen, scroll to General Options and press the
trackwheel.
Figure 7-14:

171
Chapter 7: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

4. From the General Options screen, scroll to the Keep Messages option,
press the trackwheel, and choose Change Option.
5. From the drop-down list that appears, choose the time frame that you
want.
• Forever: If you choose Forever, you will seldom need to worry
about your e-mails being automatically deleted. On the downside,
though, you will eventually run out of memory on your BlackBerry.
At that point, you must manually delete some e-mail so that you
have space to accept new e-mail. See the earlier section for delet-
ing your e-mails.
You can select another choice beside Forever to suit your needs.
• Time option: If you choose a set-time option, any message older than
that time frame is automatically deleted from your BlackBerry the
next time you reboot your BlackBerry. However, it will be deleted
only on your BlackBerry — even if you turn on e-mail reconciliation —
because these deletions are not manually completed by you.
6. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackwheel and choosing Save.

In This Chapter
 Sending PIN-to-PIN messages
 Using Short Messaging Service (SMS)
 Setting up and using instant messaging programs
 Figuring out messaging etiquette
Your BlackBerry is primarily a communication tool, with e-mail messages
and phone conversations being the major drivers here. The social crea-
tures that people are, however, we constantly come up with new ways to
communicate — ever more ways to overcome the distance barrier, as it were.
You shouldn’t be surprised that the folks at RIM have moved beyond e-mail
and phoning in their search for other ways to communicate. (And we’re not
talking semaphore or stringing together two tin cups.)
Not that we’re dismissing the power of phones and/or e-mail. Both are won-
derful technologies, but you might find yourself in a situation where other
means of communication would perhaps be more appropriate. For instance,
e-mail isn’t really the tool of choice for instant messaging/chatting — most
people would find that method really slow and cumbersome. Nor is e-mail
really the best tool to use when you want to alert someone.
“What might be a better fit?” you ask. Read this chapter to find out. You can
familiarize yourself with some of the less-obvious ways you can use your
BlackBerry to communicate — ways that might serve as the perfect fit for a
special situation. You’ll get the inside scoop on PIN-to-PIN messaging and text
messaging (also known as Short Messaging Service, or SMS). We also give you
tips on how to turn your BlackBerry into a lean (and not so mean) instant
messaging machine.

A Little Bit of RIM Prehistory
Time for a history lesson. Way back when, sometime during the last millen-
nium, Research In Motion (RIM) wasn’t even doing phone and e-mail. Before
BlackBerry became all the rage with its e-mail and phone service, RIM was
doing a tidy little business with its two-way pagers. Back then, RIM’s two-way
pagers were served by network service providers on a radio bandwidth sepa-
rate from the bandwidth that a typical cellphone infrastructure would use.
RIM also designed the infrastructure so that its two-way pagers were fast. (No
one wants a paging system that moves at turtle speed when they could get
jackrabbit speed, right?)
Several interesting facts followed from RIM’s initial decision here. Of note,
most cellphone users in New York City were left without service during the
9/11 disaster. As you can understand, the entire cellphone infrastructure in
New York and surrounding areas was totally overwhelmed when faced with
too many people trying to use the bandwidth available. However, one com-
munication device continued to work during that stressful time — RIM’s two-
way pagers kept the information flow going.
Now, this might sound like ancient history, but the point here is that the
backbone RIM built for its two-way pager communication system is still used
in your BlackBerry today. When you send a PIN-to-PIN message (more about
them later in the next section), it goes through the same pipeline as the two-
way pagers, which means that any PIN-to-PIN message you send makes its
way to its destination pretty darn fast.
But enough with the history lesson. Time to take a look at how PIN-to-PIN
messaging can help you today.
Sending and Receiving 
PIN-to-PIN Messages
What actually happens when you use PIN-to-PIN messaging? First and fore-
most, get the acronym out of the way. PIN stands for personal identification
number (familiar to anyone who’s ever used an ATM) and refers to a system
for uniquely identifying your device. PIN-to-PIN, then, is another way of saying
One BlackBerry to Another BlackBerry.
As for the other details, they’re pretty straightforward. PIN-to-PIN messaging is
based on the technology underpinning of two-way pager systems. Unlike a stan-
dard e-mail, when you send a PIN-to-PIN message, the message doesn’t venture
outside RIM’s infrastructure in search of an e-mail server and (eventually) an
e-mail inbox. Instead, it stays solidly within the RIM world, where it is shunted
174
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

through the recipient’s network provider until it ends up on the recipient’s
BlackBerry.
Here’s the neat part. According to RIM, the message isn’t saved anywhere in
this universe except on the one device that sends the PIN message and the
other device that receives it. Compare that with an e-mail, which is saved in
at least four separate locations (the mail client and e-mail servers of both
sender and recipient) not to mention all the system’s redundancies and back-
ups employed by the server. Think of it this way: If you whisper a little secret
in someone’s ear, only you and that special someone know what was said. In
a way, PIN-to-PIN messaging is the same thing, with one BlackBerry whisper-
ing to another BlackBerry. Now, that’s discreet.
If you tend to read the financial newspapers — especially the ones that cover
corporate lawsuits extensively — you’ll know that there’s no such thing as pri-
vacy in e-mail. PIN-to-PIN messaging, in theory at least, is as good as the old
Code of Silence. Now, is such privacy really an advantage? You can argue both
sides of the issue, depending on what you’d want to use PIN-to-PIN messaging
for. Basically, if you like the idea that your communications can be kept discreet,
PIN-to-PIN messaging has great curb appeal. If you couldn’t care less about pri-
vacy issues, though, you still might be impressed by PIN-to-PIN messaging’s
zippy nature. (It really is the Ferrari of wireless communication — way faster
than e-mail.)
Getting a BlackBerry PIN
When trying to call somebody on the telephone, you can’t get far without a
telephone number. As you might expect, the same principle applies to PIN-to-
PIN messaging: No PIN, no PIN-to-PIN messaging. In practical terms, this
means that you need the individual PIN of any BlackBerry device owned by
whomever you want to send a PIN message to. (You also need to find out
your own PIN so you can hand it out to those folks who want to PIN-message
you.) The cautious side of you might be thinking now, why on earth would I
give my PIN to somebody? This PIN is really not the same as your password.
In fact, this PIN doesn’t give anybody access to your BlackBerry or do any-
thing to compromise security. It’s simply an identification; you treat it the
same way as you treat your phone number.
RIM makes getting a hold of a PIN easy. In fact, RIM even provides you with
multiple paths to PIN enlightenment, as the following list makes clear:
 From the Help screen: You can find the PIN for any device right there on
its Help screen. On most BlackBerry models, you can call up the Help
screen by pressing Alt+CAP+H. (The ALT key is the bottom-left corner
key, with the half-moon icon.) This shortcut to the Help screen is not
available on 7100 series.
175
Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail

 From the Message screen: RIM also makes it easy for you to send your
PIN from the Message screen with the help of a keyword. A keyword is a
neat feature with which you type a preset word, and your BlackBerry
replaces what you type with a bit of information specific to your device.
Sound wacky? It’s actually easier than it sounds. To see what we mean,
just compose a new e-mail/message. (Chapter 7 gives you the basics on
the whole e-mail/messaging thing, if you need a refresher.) On the subject
or body of your message, type mypin and add a space. As soon as you
type the space, mypin is miraculously transformed into your PIN in the
format pin:your-pin-number, as shown in Figure 8-1. Isn’t that neat?
mypin isn’t the only keyword that RIM predefines for you.
 From the Status screen: You can also find your PIN on the Status screen.
On most BlackBerry models, you display the Status screen by choosing
Options (Settings) from the Home screen, selecting Status from the con-
textual menu that appears, and then pressing the trackwheel. Figure 8-2
shows a typical Status screen. (The PIN is fifth on the list of items shown.)

Assigning PINs to names
So, you convince your BlackBerry-wielding buddies to go to the trouble of
finding out their PINs and passing said PINs to you. Now, the trick is finding a
convenient place to store your PINs so you can actually use them. Luckily for
you, you have an obvious choice: The BlackBerry Address Book. And RIM, in
its infinite wisdom, makes storing such info a snap, just like the following
steps show. To add a PIN to someone’s contact info in your Address Book,
just do the following:
1. Using the trackwheel, scroll to highlight Address Book on the
BlackBerry Home screen and then press the trackwheel.
The Address Book opens.
2. Scroll to highlight a contact name, press the trackwheel, and then
choose Edit from the menu that appears.
The Edit Address screen for the contact name you selected makes an
appearance.
3. On the Edit Address screen, scroll down to the PIN field (as shown in
Figure 8-3.
4. Enter the PIN by pressing letters and numbers on the keyboard.
5. Press the trackwheel and then choose Save from the menu that
appears.
The edit you made on this contact is now saved.
It’s that simple. Of course, it’s even easier if you think ahead and enter any
and all PIN information you have right when you set up your initial contact
info (using the New Address screen), but we understand that a PIN isn’t usu-
ally the kind of info your causal acquaintances carry around with them.
Figure 8-3:
Add a

Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail

If all this talk about New Address screens and Edit Address screens doesn’t
sound all that familiar, check out Chapter 3, which covers the whole Address
Book application in more detail.
Sending a PIN-to-PIN message
Sending a PIN-to-PIN message is no different than sending an e-mail. Here’s how:
1. Using the trackwheel, scroll to highlight Address Book on the
BlackBerry Home screen and then press the trackwheel.
The Address Book opens.
2. Scroll to highlight a contact name, press the trackwheel, and then
choose PIN <contact name> from the menu that appears.
Say, for example, you have a contact named Dante Sarigumba. When you
highlight Dante Sarigumba in the list and then press the trackwheel, the
menu item PIN Dante Sarigumba appears as an option, as shown in
Figure 8-4.
3. Press ENTER.
The ever-familiar New Message screen, with the PIN of your buddy 
already entered as an address, makes an appearance. Treat the other
e-mail-creation stuff — adding a subject line, entering the body of your
message, and then signing off — just as you would with a normal e-mail.
Alternatively, if you know the PIN, you can also type it directly. Sending a PIN-
to-PIN message is no different than sending an e-mail. Here’s how:
1. Using the trackwheel, scroll to highlight Messages on the BlackBerry
Home screen and then press the trackwheel.
The Messages application opens.
Figure 8-4:
Send a PIN

via your

178
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

2. Press the trackwheel, scroll down the menu that appears, and click
Compose PIN.
A Select Address screen shows up. This screen is your Address Book. 
3. Highlight [Use Once] from the top of the Select Address list, press the
trackwheel, and select PIN from the menu that appears.
The One Time PIN screen shows up with the PIN text field ready for your
entry.
4. Enter the PIN by pressing the letters and numbers that comprise the
PIN. Press ENTER.
The ever-familiar New Message screen, with the PIN you entered as an
address, makes an appearance. Again, treat the other e-mail-creation
stuff — adding a subject line, entering the body of your message, and
then signing off — just like you would a normal e-mail.
Because of the nature of PIN-to-PIN messaging (the conspicuous lack of a
paper trail, as it were), RIM has set it up so that companies can disable PIN-
to-PIN messaging on your BlackBerry device. (No paper trail can mean legal
problems down the road — can you say Sarbanes-Oxley?) If your BlackBerry
is from your employer and you don’t see the PIN menu item allowing you to
send PIN-to-PIN messages, you can safely assume that your employer has dis-
abled it. Contact your BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) administrator to
make sure. (See Chapter 1 for an explanation of BES.) Keep in mind that even
if your company has disabled PIN-to-PIN messaging, folks can still PIN you —
you just won’t be able to PIN them back in response.
Receiving a PIN-to-PIN message
Receiving a PIN-to-PIN message is no different than receiving a standard
e-mail. You get the same entry into your Message list for the PIN-to-PIN mes-
sage that you receive, and the same message screen displays when you open
the message. By default, your BlackBerry will vibrate to alert you, but this
behavior can be customized in Profiles. In Profiles, PIN-to-PIN is a Level1
Message. (Check Chapter 2 for more details on changing your profile.) When
you reply to the message, the reply is a PIN-to-PIN message as well — that is,
as long as your BlackBerry is set up to send PIN-to-PIN messages. Again,
because this involves a BlackBerry-to-BlackBerry communication, you won’t
see a PIN message show up on your desktop e-mail client’s inbox.
Regardless of whether your BlackBerry is enabled for sending PIN-to-PIN 
messages, you can always receive a PIN message. BES administrators can
mandate that you can’t send PIN messages, but that can’t stop you from
receiving them.

Keeping in Touch, the SMS Way
Short Messaging Service (also known as SMS, or simply text messaging) is so
popular these days that even the Fox Network TV show American Idol lets
you vote for the show’s contestants via SMS. Moreover, SMS is a pretty estab-
lished technology (not a new and unproven thing, in other words) that has
been popular for years in Europe and Asia where the Global System for
Mobile Communication (GSM) is the technology of choice among cellphone
network providers. How short is short? 160 characters is about the maximum
size per message. If you send more than that, it gets broken down into multi-
ple messages.
Whether you call it SMS, Short Messaging Service, or just plain text messag-
ing, your BlackBerry makes it pretty simple. But before we go over all the
details, we want to point out to all you 7100 series owners out there that text
messaging does pose a bit of a challenge for beginners. Not that it’s a difficult
task, but it’s a little bit cumbersome to type the letters using the limited
keypad.
Also, you need to be aware of the growing trends and options for text mes-
saging. There is a growing SMS subculture among teenagers and those who
180
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 
SMS is a smash!
In the early days of SMS, phone providers gave
away their text messaging services for free. It
caught on like wildfire, especially in developing
countries where folks are a tad more cost-con-
scious. In those countries, it didn’t take long
before lots of folks started carrying a cellphone
just to avail themselves of the free text messag-
ing. Adding to the appeal was the fact that many
network service providers didn’t even force you
to pay for a plan; you could walk into any con-
venience store and buy a prepaid SIM card, no
questions asked. By the way, Subscriber
Identification Module, or SIM, is a tiny electronic
chip found in the back of a GSM phone. This chip
is your gate to using the phone network.
In the United States, however, it took some 
time for SMS to catch up. For one thing, network
service providers in the U.S. are divided
between CDMA and GSM/GPRS technology.
(See Chapter 1 for more on that divide.)
GSM/GPRS phones have allowed for SMS since
1991; CDMA phones did not until about 2000.
(Competing innovations do have a downside,
right?) The second reason is that most
American homes are wired for regular phone
service, so cellphones are not necessarily seen
as something you just gotta have. Eventually,
though, the convenience of using cellphones
will make them more and more attractive —
and, of course, SMS is just the next logical step.
Most people refer to SMS as text, so don’t con-
fuse the two — they’re the same thing.

jumped onto the bandwagon early. These in-the-know folks use abbreviations
frequently that might be difficult for you to understand in the beginning, so
don’t dive in without your oxygen tank. A quick preparation goes a long way
towards avoiding being labeled uncool when it comes to your SMS syntax.
The upcoming sections help smooth your path a bit by filling you in on the
basics of SMS-speak.
Using shorthand for speedy replies
From the get-go, text messaging sprang up from the wild and crazy world of
cellphone users. And those of you who’ve used a phone lately probably know
that phone design revolves around entering phone numbers rather than
entering the text to War and Peace. Time for a reality check: On a regular cell-
phone, three letters share a single key. As you can imagine, trying to bang out
even a single paragraph can be a real pain.
Even with such limitations, though, human ingenuity prevails. People have
found ways to circumvent the fact that cellphones have such a limited
number of keys at their disposal. One strategy that we highlight here involves
using abbreviations — shorthand — that allow you to cut down on the
amount of text you need to enter. These shorthand words are not only popu-
lar, but they’re also quickly becoming quite hip. A whole subculture (admit-
tedly dominated by the 14–18-year-old set) has decided that the normal rules
regarding English spelling and grammar are no longer operative — that they
are, in fact, very uncool. Veteran text messagers (the hip ones, at least) can
easily spot someone who is new to SMS technology by how they don’t use
the right lingo — or use such lingo incorrectly.
Proud owners of a 7100 series BlackBerry who are beginners to SMS might be
tempted to rely on BlackBerry’s default SureType feature when text messag-
ing. SureType is a technology used in BlackBerry 7100 series to compensate
for the limited keys at your disposal. The software is smart enough to predict
what you want to type. It also has the capability to learn and become smarter
as you use it. The technology is really neat, making it possible for you to type
words faster and more easily on a 7100 model. However, you might find your-
self in a situation in which you receive text from buddies who use the cool,
with-it, hip shorthand lingo, and you respond with all the white-bread,
uncool, complete words provided for you by SureType technology. To pre-
serve (or create) your cool image, we recommend disabling SureType when
you do any text messaging. (Chapter 2 fills you in on how to toggle SureType
on and off.) That way, you can learn shorthand without any interference from
SureType and transform yourself into a text-messaging fool.
181
Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail

Awhfy?
In text messaging, the challenge lies in using abbreviations to craft a sentence
with as few letters as possible. Because text messaging has been around for a
number of years, plenty of folks have risen to this challenge by coming up
with a considerable pool of useful abbreviations. Don’t feel you have to rush
out and memorize the whole shorthand dictionary at once, though. As with
learning a new language, start out with the most commonly used words or
sentences. Then, when you become familiar with those, slowly gather in more
and more terms so that in time, the whole shorthand thing is second nature.
And what are the most commonly used terms out there? Funny you should
ask. Table 8-1 gives you our take on the most common abbreviations, which
are enough to get you started. With these under your belt, you can at least
follow the most important parts of an SMS conversation.

prehensive list of shorthand abbreviations.
Showing some emotion
One aspect of written communication that has gotten a few folks in trouble
now and then is that the very same words can mean different things to differ-
ent people. A simple example is the phrase, “You’re such a clueless individ-
ual.” When you speak such a phrase (with the appropriate facial and/or hand
gestures), your conversational partner knows right off the bat (we hope) that
you’re teasing and that it’s all just a bit of fun. Write that same phrase in a
text message, and well, you might get a nasty reply in return — which you
then have to respond to, which prompts another response, and soon enough
you’ve just ended that seven-year friendship.
Because SMS is meant for quick and short messages akin to chatting —
rather than long and drawn-out debates about what you actually meant when
you said what — a quick-and-dirty system for characterizing what you’ve just
written (I’m joking! I’m happy! I’m mad!) has sprung up. Known as emoticons,
these cutesy typographical devices let you telegraph your meaning in 
sledgehammer-to-the forehead fashion.
183
Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail

Yes, we’re talking smileys here — those combinations of keyboard characters
that when artfully combined together, resemble a human face. The most popu-
lar example — one that you’ve probably encountered in e-mails from especially
chirpy individuals — is the happy face ( :) ), which you see used (usually at the
end of a statement) to convey good intentions or imply a happy context.
Table 8-2 shows you the range of smiley choices. The trick to recognizing
what each smiley conveys lies in your ability to view them sideways (hope-
fully without developing a crick in your neck). Just remember that smileys
are supposed to be fun. They could be the one thing you need to make sure
that your “gently teasing remark” isn’t misconstrued as a hateful comment.

Sending a text message
After you have the shorthand stuff as well as the smileys under your belt, get
your fingers pumped up and ready for action: It’s message sending time!
Here’s how it’s done:
1. Highlight Address Book from the BlackBerry Home screen and press
the trackwheel.
The Address Book opens.
2. Scroll and highlight a contact with a cellphone number, press the
trackwheel, and choose SMS <contact name> from the contextual
menu that appears.
The menu item for SMS is intelligent enough to display the name of the
contact. For example, if you choose John Doe, the menu item reads SMS
John Doe, as shown in Figure 8-5. Note the space for entering your text
message, right underneath the screen heading.
Figure 8-5:

185
Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail

3. Type your message.
Remember that shorthand business? You should start taking advantage
of it the first chance you get. (Practice makes perfect.) When you’re
done typing your message, get ready to send it.
4. Press the trackwheel and choose Send from the contextual menu that
appears.
Your SMS message is sent on its merry way.
Viewing a text message you receive
If you have an incoming SMS message, you get notification just like you do
when you receive an e-mail. Also, like e-mail, the E-mail icon on the top of the
Home screen indicates a new message. In fact, everything about viewing SMS
messages is pretty much the same as what you do when reading an e-mail; so
if you have Chapter 7 loaded into your memory, you know how to read SMS
messages. The basic run-through is as follows:
1. Open Messages.
2. Scroll to the unread message.
3. Press the trackwheel.
4. Choose Open from the menu.
5. Bob’s your uncle: The message displays onscreen.
You can customize how your BlackBerry notifies you when you receive an
SMS message. Chapter 2 has the scoop on all the customization options for
your BlackBerry, including options for SMS notification. (Look for the section
about customizing your profile.)
Always Online Using Instant Messaging
Real-time conversation with your friends or buddies over the Internet is
easier with the advent of instant messaging. This technology allows two or
more people to send and receive messages quickly with the use of software
that uses the Internet as the wire. It all started with pure text messages and
evolved into a rich medium involving voice and even video conversation in
real-time.
Instant messaging is a recent addition to the BlackBerry and might not be
available by default to all models. (Most providers, however, do support it for
7100 models.) Here’s the deal: You can add instant messaging to your
BlackBerry even if it didn’t come as a default. Now, for those who already
186
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

have an instant messaging program installed, you’re in luck. You can go on
your merry IM way. However, for those of you out there lacking an IM applica-
tion, don’t despair. See the upcoming section that provides step-by-step
instructions on how to get an instant messaging program installed on your
BlackBerry. As of this time, IM in the BlackBerry is all text messages.
Chatting using IM rules
When America Online (AOL) came out with AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) in the
mid-1990s, it was an overnight hit. What made it successful was that it could
provide quick (instantaneous) responses to any messages you sent out. In addi-
tion, the service introduced many simple (yet clever) functions that offer you a
totally unique way of communicating. For example, you can chat with multiple
people at the same time. You can tell whether someone is trying to type a mes-
sage to you. You can even tell whether your buddies are online, away from their
computers, or simply too busy to be interrupted at the moment. IM adds up to a
totally different slant on long distance communication, opening a wide array of
possibilities — possibilities that can be used for good (team collaboration) or ill
(mindless gossip), depending on the situation.
As you might expect, AIM is great for both personal and business applications.
In the business world, AIM provides the link so that employees can be always
connected with their colleagues, no matter how distant they might be, making
working collaboratively far easier. On the personal side, this new way of keep-
ing in touch has been embraced by a pretty broad swath of the population —
and not just the teen set. Whether you’re busy maintaining friendships or
busily working to create new ones, Instant Messenger is definitely one power-
ful tool to consider adding to your social skills toolbox.
Given the popularity of AIM, you’ve likely used it before. You might even have
it installed on your desktop machine. And with your BlackBerry, being away
from your desktop computer doesn’t necessarily mean going offline. You can
set up the same AIM services on your BlackBerry just as long as your device
is running OS (operating system) version 3.8 or greater. (Instant Messenger
won’t run on an earlier OS.) If you have an older OS and you want to AIM, you
need to upgrade your OS. Our recommendation is to go for OS v. 4.0. (For
more on finding your BlackBerry OS version, including upgrade issues, see
Chapter 12.)
If your employer provides your BlackBerry, Instant Messenger might not
work on your device. Companies do have the option of telling their network
administrators to block all the AIM network addresses, effectively shutting
you out of the AIM system. If that’s the case, your chances of being able to
use AIM in your BlackBerry are almost zero. (You can always get your own
personal BlackBerry, though. With all the offerings network providers give
nowadays, you might even get one for free.)
187
Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail

Instant messaging on a 7100 model
Lucky you! Instant Messaging (IM) comes standard with many 7100 BlackBerry
devices. Most network providers dish out the three most popular IM services
on this planet to their 7100 customers: the ubiquitous AOL Instant Messenger
(also know as AIM), the up-and-coming Yahoo! Messenger, and last but not least,
ICQ Instant Messenger. ICQ is the first IM program that can run on a PC. These
three preloaded IM programs are definitely not the only popular ones — as
some of you might be using MSN Messenger from Microsoft or iChat AV,
which runs in Macintosh. There’s also Jabber, which is favored by the Open
Source (collaborative efforts of individuals to create free software) commu-
nity. If you are using any of these IM networks not covered by the preloaded
ones, don’t despair. In the upcoming sections “Instant Messaging on a non-
7100 model” and “Taking control of your IM app,” we’ll discuss other pro-
grams that you can install to run the IM networks you’re using.
With so many choices, you could never go wrong, right? Not so fast, good
buddy. If you’re not careful, you’ll find yourself contributing more moolah to
your network service provider’s bottom line than you expected. Most IM
applications use SMS behind the scenes. And what does that have to do with
the price of tea in China? Well, without an SMS plan, you’ll be suckered into
high per-message cost for SMS access. Before you proceed, make sure that
you understand the finer points of your current plan. And remember:
Sometimes words on these plans can be misleading. For example, your plan
might state that you have unlimited data and Internet access — but then the
plan doesn’t define SMS as either data or Internet access.
Bottom line here: Don’t assume that SMS is part of the unlimited data plan.
Scour your plan contract for sections that deal specifically with SMS, paying
particular attention to whether you have unlimited SMS included. If not — and
if you’re considering using IM heavily — consider getting a plan that specifi-
cally allows for unlimited SMS; otherwise, be prepared to shell out some real
dough. Or, if it’s possible, simply add SMS to your current plan. If you have
any doubts about what your plan covers, call your network service provider.
Any other options? Now that you mention it, you can jump ship and go with
another IM application — one that connects directly to an IM network on the
Internet, rather that relying on SMS. In the upcoming section, “Taking control
of your IM app,” you’ll find out more about some of the options you have.
IM basics: What you need
Assuming that your plan covers a good deal of SMS, all you need to start
using any of the standard three IM applications is a user ID and a password. 
If you don’t have a user ID/password combo yet, getting one is a breeze. Just
go to the appropriate registration Web page (see below) for the IM applica-
tion(s) you want to use. Use your desktop or laptop machine for signing up.
It’s easier and faster that way.

right side of Figure 8-6.) You can choose from any of the three IM appli-
cation icons, based on where your ID is valid.
2. Highlight the IM application icon of your choice and press ENTER.
An application-specific login screen shows up for you to sign in, as
shown in Figure 8-7. They’re all pretty straightforward, with the standard
screen name/ID line and password line. Each screen also offers a Save
Password check box; when enabled, it allows you to keep the ID/pass-
word information pre-entered next time you come back to this screen.
(Um, you don’t have to type this stuff every time you want to IM.) We

Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail

recommend you mark this check box to save you time, but also set your
handheld password enabled so that security is not compromised. Refer
back to Chapter 2 if you need a refresher on how to enable password on
your BlackBerry.
3. Enter your screen name/ID and password, select the Save Password
check box (if desired), press the trackwheel, and then choose Sign In
from the contextual menu that appears.
At this point, IM tries to log you in. This can take a couple of seconds,
during which the screen reads Connecting to AOL or Connecting
to Yahoo! or Connecting to ICQ while it’s in this phase. After
you’re logged in, a simple listing of your contacts/buddies (AIM refers to
contacts as Buddies) shows up onscreen.
4. Highlight the contact in the list you’d like to chat with, press the track-
wheel, and choose the action you’d like from the menu that appears.
Your menu options here include sending a message or adding/deleting a
contact, among others.
Adding a contact
Before you can start chatting with your contacts, you need to know their user
IDs as well. For AIM, you need to get it from your friend, or you can search
AOL’s directory. For Yahoo! users, the ID can be found on their Yahoo! e-mail
addresses. (It’s the text before the @ sign.) ICQ uses an ICQ number as a user
ID. Again, you can always have your friend e-mail it to you or you can search
the ICQ Global Directory.
Luckily for you, you don’t need to search around for IDs every time you want
to IM someone. IM lets you store IDs as part of a contact list so you can grab
Figure 8-7:

screens 
for the three
IM services
that come

series.
190
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

an ID whenever you need one. To add the ID of a contact to your contact list,
just do the following:
1. Starting within the IM service of your choice, press the trackwheel,
and then choose Add Buddy from the menu that appears as shown in
Figure 8-8.
The Add Buddy screen appears.
2. Enter the user ID of your buddy in the Add Contact screen and then
press ENTER.
IM is smart enough to figure out whether this contact is a valid user ID
or not. If the ID is valid, the application adds the ID to your list of con-
tacts. The contact goes either to Online or Offline section of your list,
depending on whether your contact is logged in.
Doing the chat thing
Suppose you want to start a conversation with one of your contacts (a safe
assumption on our part, we think). Just log in to the IM application, as
described in the preceding section and send a message to your contact. By
sending a message within the IM application, you’re initiating a conversation.
Here are all the details on how to do it:
1. In the contacts list of the IM application of your choice, highlight the
contact to whom you want to send a message, press the trackwheel,
and then choose Send a Message from the menu that appears.
A typical online chat screen shows up. The top portion of the screen
lists the sequence of previous messages you sent to and received from
this contact. The bottom portion of the screen is where you type your
message.
Figure 8-8:
The AOL 
IM menu.
191
Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail

2. Enter your message, press the trackwheel, and then choose Send from
the menu that appears.
Your user ID plus the message you just sent shows up in the topmost
(history) section of the chat screen. When you receive a message, it gets
appended to the history section as well so that both sides of your 
e-conversation stay in view.
Instant messaging on a non-7100 model
You can get IM applications right out of the box with any 7100 models, but
what’s a person to do if her BlackBerry is a different model? The good news
here is that where there’s a will, there’s a way. You’ll need to do a little bit of
work to get IM rolling for you, but we break down the process for you so that
it won’t be too hard to follow. In a matter of minutes, you’ll have your IM
application installed, and you’ll be able to rock and roll.
Before you continue with the rest of this section: If you have a company-
provided BlackBerry, make sure that your company policy allows you to use
IM. Otherwise, you might not be able to upgrade and install applications on
your BlackBerry.
Getting off on the right foot
IM on the BlackBerry is a fairly new addition. As such, you need a relatively
recent OS for it to run effectively. In the BlackBerry world, this means at least
version 3.8 or higher. (We strongly recommend bumping up to OS v. 4.0 or
higher, if at all possible.) If your BlackBerry has OS version prior to 3.8, you
need to upgrade it to the latest version.
Upgrading is easy; check out Chapter 12 for more details on how to upgrade
your device.
Seeing what applications are available
Depending on which network service provider you’re signed up for and what
IM services you want to use, your choices can vary. We describe a sample of
what’s available in the following list. (For updated listings, check out the Web
site associated with this book.)
 VeriChat for BlackBerry
www.pdaapps.com/verichat_bby
This IM application is a one-stop shop for anyone using multiple IM net-
works. It supports Yahoo!, ICQ, MSN, and AOL.
VeriChat works well on GPRS networks. You might have problems run-
ning the application on a CDMA network, however, if your BlackBerry is
192
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

not under BES. (Read about CDMA and GPRS in Chapter 1.) You may
avail hosted BES for best performance under CDMA network. Some third
party vendors offer their BES server for you to host BlackBerry services
for a monthly fee. One of these companies is MailStreet, charging $9.95
U.S. per month. Read about it on its Web site at www.mailstreet.net/
wireless/default.asp. Just understand that in order for it to host
BlackBerry services on its BES, you also need to use its e-mail server,
which can be an additional cost. Plus, MailStreet charges a one-time acti-
vation fee of $39.95 U.S.
 Ramble IM
http://wireless.sra.com/ramble
You can’t beat the price — it’s freeware — but it supports only AOL.
 BlackChat ICQ
http://sourceforge.net/projects/blackchat
Again, the price is good — freeware, yet again — but it works only on
the ICQ network.
Installing an IM application is easy; you have two download options:
 Directly to your device through a browser download
 To your desktop machine and then sync it to your device
If you’re willing to wait a bit and are in a good signal area, we recommend you
go for a browser download method because the steps are quite easy.
Make sure that you don’t move to an area with no network signal while the
download is progressing. You don’t want to interrupt the download, forcing
you to start all over again.
1. Point your BlackBerry Browser to the application developer’s Web site:
a. Click the Go To button in the browser’s main menu.
b. Enter the URL in the screen that appears.
For example, to install Ramble IM, enter
http://wireless.sra.com/ramble.
c. Click OK using the trackwheel.
For more on how to use your BlackBerry Browser to surf the Internet,
check out Chapter 9.
2. In the Web page that appears, click the Download link.
Your download begins. After all the files are downloaded to your
BlackBerry, a dialog box appears, prompting you to run the application.
193
Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail

3. Using your trackwheel, click OK to start the application.
You are now ready to rumble, or ramble, or whatever.
For tips on installing applications to your device from your desktop com-
puter using the BlackBerry Desktop Manager, please see Chapter 12.
Using BlackBerry Messenger
RIM itself has entered the IM application horse race in the form of a spirited
filly named — you guessed it — BlackBerry Messenger. This application is
based on the PIN-to-PIN messaging technology described earlier in this chap-
ter, which means that it is mucho fast and quite reliable. However, with
BlackBerry Messenger, you can chat with only those buddies who have a
BlackBerry and also have PIN-to-PIN messaging enabled. The application sup-
ports IM features common to many of the other applications, like group chat-
ting and the capability to monitor the availability of other IM buddies.
Use your BlackBerry Browser to download BlackBerry Messenger from the
RIM Web site at www.blackberry.com/messenger. If you use the browser
on your desktop computer, the site allows for installation through a cable
running from your USB port to your device.
In our opinion, the most convenient way to download and install BlackBerry
Messenger is to use your BlackBerry Browser. Here’s how:
1. From the BlackBerry Browser, press the trackwheel and select Go To.
Enter http://www.blackberry.com/messenger in the screen that appears
(see Figure 8-9), and then highlight OK, and press the trackwheel.
The BlackBerry Messenger main Web page appears, displaying informa-
tion about the product as well as a Download Now link.
Figure 8-9:

194
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

2. Click the Download Now link on the Web page.
Doing so brings up the Terms & Conditions page — the one that nobody
reads.
3. If you accept the terms (and who wouldn’t?), click the Accept button.
Of course, you have to scroll down to the very bottom of the page to
find the Accept button, but you knew that already.
4. In the new page that appears, click the link to download the application.
The usual Download and Install screen appears, giving you the details of
the application you’re trying to install, as shown in Figure 8-10.
5. Click Download in the new screen.
Your download starts, and you’re treated to a bar tracking your down-
load progress, as shown on the left side of Figure 8-11.

195
Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail

6. After the download is complete, click the Run button (see the right
side of Figure 8-11) to start the application immediately.
Note: Clicking OK in this screen completes the download process but
does not immediately start BlackBerry Messenger.
Running BlackBerry Messenger
After you go to the trouble of downloading and installing BlackBerry
Messenger, you can always access the application through your device’s
Home screen. (The icon for BlackBerry Messenger on most devices sports a
rather chirpy happy face, as shown on the left in Figure 8-12. Remember,
though, that on 7100 models, you access an add-on application like BlackBerry
Messenger by using the Applications icon you see here in the margin.)
The very first time you run BlackBerry Messenger, the application throws up
a dialog box asking you for your display name, as shown on the right in
Figure 8-12. The application also asks you to define a password in case you
need to restore your Contact List at some point in the future.
The next time you open the application, you see an IM-style Contact List, as
shown on the left in Figure 8-13. (Okay, we know it looks pretty empty right
now, but we show you how to populate it in a minute.) To customize the
groupings, add a contact, set your availability, start a conversation, or
change your options, just press the trackwheel to call up the BlackBerry
Messenger menu, as shown on the right in Figure 8-13.

Adding a contact
With nobody in your Contact List, BlackBerry Messenger is a pretty useless
item. Your first order of business is to add a contact to your list — someone
you know who has a BlackBerry, is entered in your Address Book, has PIN-to-
PIN messaging enabled, and is willing to have a copy of BlackBerry Messenger
installed on his/her device as well. If you know someone who fits these crite-
ria, you can add him to your list by doing the following:
1. In BlackBerry Messenger, press the trackwheel and then click Add a
Contact from the contextual menu that appears.
A listing of all the contacts contained in your BlackBerry Address Book
shows up onscreen.
2. Highlight the name you want to add to your BlackBerry Messenger
Contact List and then press the trackwheel.
A menu similar to the one shown in Figure 8-14 appears.

Figure 8-13:

197
Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail

Note: This is also a quick way for you to check whether you have a PIN
for the person. Without the PIN, the Request (PIN) <contact name> menu
item won’t appear. Read how to add a PIN to a contact name in the ear-
lier section, “Assigning PINs to names.”
3. Choose Request (PIN) <contact name> from the menu.
A Message dialog box appears, displaying the Add Request message the
application sends to the potential contact, as shown in Figure 8-15.
Most IM applications ask a potential contact for permission to add him or
her to someone’s Contact List. BlackBerry Messenger is no different here.
Before adding someone to the BlackBerry Messenger Contact List, the
application sends a message to the other party asking for permission.
4. After making any potential edits, click OK, and then click OK again in
the screen that follows.
The application sends your request for the contact to be added to your
BlackBerry Messenger Contact List. As long as the person has not
responded to your request, his or her name appears as part of the
Pending group, as shown in Figure 8-16. When your contact responds
positively to your request, that name is moved from the Pending group
to the official Contact List.
Figure 8-15:
Potential

198
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

Starting a conversation
You can easily start a conversation with any of your contacts through the
BlackBerry Messenger main menu. Just highlight a name from your Contacts
List and press the trackwheel; a Start Conversation option appears on the
menu. Choosing that option opens a traditional Chat interface, with a histori-
cal listing of messages at the top and a textbox for typing messages at the
bottom. After typing your message, just press the ENTER key to send it. Any
messages you send (as well as any responses you get in return) are appended
to the History list at the top.
Starting a group conference
Whenever you’re conversing with someone via your BlackBerry Messenger,
you can easily invite others in. Just press the trackwheel while conversing to
call up the BlackBerry Messenger main menu; this time you see that an Invite
option has been added. Clicking this option allows you to select any number
of people from your Contact List one at a time from the Select a Contact
screen that follows. Use the trackwheel to select the contact and then high-
light and click OK. After clicking OK, you’re back to the previous conversa-
tion screen, but this time you see in the History list a text saying that the
name of your contact has been added to the conversation. The newly
selected contact can now join in the conversation.
Taking control of your IM app
If you use IM frequently — and you tend to chat with many contacts simulta-
neously — you might find that the physical limitations of your BlackBerry
cramp your instant messaging style. No matter whether you use AIM, Yahoo!
IM, ICQ, or BlackBerry Messenger, it’s still slower to type words in the tiny
Figure 8-16:
To-be-
approved

Pending
group.
199
Chapter 8: Too Cool for E-Mail

keypad than to type on your desktop or laptop. So, do you just give up on the
dream of instant messaging on-the-go? Not necessarily. The following sec-
tions show you how you can power up your BlackBerry IM technique.
Less is more
If you can’t keep up with all your buddies, your best bet is to limit your expo-
sure. Take a whack at your Contact List so that only your true buddies remain
as contacts whom you want to IM from your BlackBerry. Trimming your list is
easy — to delete a contact from your IM application, use the Delete option
from your BlackBerry Messenger main menu.
A word of caution before you start pruning your contacts: Deleting a contact
from an IM application on your BlackBerry also deletes it from the desktop 
or laptop computer version of the app. That’s because the list of contacts is
maintained at a central location — an IM server, to be precise — and not on
your BlackBerry. A simple workaround here is to set up two accounts of your
favorite IM application — one for your BlackBerry and one for your desktop.
By using these accounts separately, you can limit the number of contacts you
have on your BlackBerry and still maintain a full-blown list of contacts on
your desktop. Don’t worry about limiting your number of contacts: The abil-
ity to respond quickly to a core group of your buddies should work to your
advantage.
Lesser typing and emoticons
Cut down your typing time. Don’t forget the shorthand described in the ear-
lier section. It’s widely used in IM as well, so refer to Table 8-1 whenever you
can so that you can quickly respond. Before you know it, you’ll have the
shorthand abbreviations memorized and use them with ease. The emoticons
also can make your conversation more interesting. Always take them out of
your toolbox. Again, refer to Table 8-2 for the list of the most common ones.
Comparing IM with SMS versus connecting via the Web
SMS messages, as the name implies, are short messages designed for cell-
phones. It’s almost chat-like but not as compared to IM. IM is a step up, evolv-
ing from the Internet wherein bandwidth is no longer a concern. It provides a
better real-time conversation experience across distances. These two technolo-
gies evolved in parallel. As more people use IM, it becomes apparent that this
technology has a place in the handheld devices, where mobility is an advan-
tage. Some of the IM programs developed and used in the BlackBerry use SMS
behind the scenes. And because your BlackBerry is also capable of connecting
to the Internet, other programs use the Internet directly. These differences can
affect your monthly bill as well as your messaging experience. Read on.
The IM applications provided by your service provider for the 7100 BlackBerry
use Short Messaging Service (SMS) as the medium to communicate with the
IM networks. Aspects of SMS use might interest you, especially if you’re con-
cerned about the costs associated with IM on your BlackBerry. First, if you
200
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

have unlimited SMS in your plan, the IM applications on your 7100 are defi-
nitely going to be less costly. Comparatively, if you don’t have unlimited SMS
but have an unlimited data plan, you’re better off purchasing IM software that
connects directly to the IM network from your BlackBerry. Direct connection
is faster than using SMS, so you will have a better experience. Direct connec-
tion does mean heavy wireless use, however, which quickly drains your battery.
On non-7100 models, IM programs are not preloaded as of this writing. If you
install IM programs, make sure that you understand what the program uses
behind the scene to communicate. Again, if it uses SMS, review your plan and
make sure it includes SMS. If it uses the Internet, make sure you have an
unlimited data plan.
Another feature you might find appealing about some of the third-party IM
software is that they allow for group conversations. This is not available on
the IM software that comes preloaded with the 7100.
Annoyance factor: On the preloaded 7100 IM software, you can’t use the
ENTER key to send a message; you always have to display the menu to send it.
Other IM recommendations
If you’re using only AIM for messaging, your best option is to download Ramble
IM. This is a freeware program (available from http://wireless.sra.com/
ramble) that connects directly to the Web rather than using SMS. If you’re not
on an unlimited SMS plan, going with Ramble IM can save you some bucks.
For multiple IM network support, one of the best options available is VeriChat
(available for download from www.pdaapps.com/verichat_bby). VeriChat
does have one downside: It requires an annual subscription fee. A standard
one account per IM type subscription will cost you $34.95 U.S. for the first year
and $24.95 U.S. for the succeeding years. If you don’t want to pay annually, con-
sider IM+ (available for download at www.shapeservices.com/eng/im/
BLACKBERRY). IM+ only asks for a one-time fee of $44.95 U.S. and also sup-
ports multiple networks. There are two versions available, the Regular ver-
sion and the WAP version. The Regular version connects to BES. (Please read
Chapter 1 for details on BlackBerry Enterprise Server.) BES is used by compa-
nies as a way of connecting the BlackBerry platform to the corporate network
and e-mail server. The WAP version IM+ allows a personal BlackBerry to use
the network provider’s WAP gateway to connect to the Internet. Shape
Services Web site has a comprehensive frequently asked questions (FAQ) for
more details about the software. The best thing about IM+ is that it uses the
Internet for sending messages and instead of using SMS, which is best suited
for people who have the unlimited data plan.
Please check out the Web site associated with this book for updates regard-
ing these (and other) recommendations.

Messaging Etiquette and 
a Few Words of Caution
We end this chapter with some common sense messaging rules as well as a
few words of caution. Even if you’re new to messaging, being a neophyte
doesn’t give you free license to act like a jerk. So remember, play nice and
take the following pointers to heart:
 Use smileys to avoid misunderstandings. Read more about emoticons
and smileys earlier in this chapter.
 Do not ever forward chain letters. (We mean it. Never.)
 If you need to forward a message, check the entire message content
first. Make sure nothing offends the recipient.
 Some things in this world need to be said face to face, so don’t even
think of using messaging for it. Ever tried dumping your girlfriend/
boyfriend over the phone? Guess what. Using messaging is a far 
worse idea.
 Keep your tone gender neutral. Remember: Your message can be for-
warded with a few simple clicks.
 Capital letters are like shouting, so DON’T DO IT.
 Know your recipient. A newbie may not easily grasp smileys and short-
hand at first, so act accordingly. (Read more about shorthand earlier in
this chapter.)
 Don’t reply to any message when you’re angry. A message sent is a mes-
sage sent — there’s no way to undo it. Better to be prudent than sorry.
 Don’t spread gossip or make personal remarks about other people.
Beware! Your messages can end up in the wrong hands and haunt you in
the future.
 Easy does it. There is no documented evidence of the deleterious effects
(physical or psychological) of too much text messaging. However, don’t
text message as if you wanted to enter the books as the first recorded case
of Instantmesssagingitis. As your great grandma would tell you, too much
of anything is bad for you. It’s easy to lose track of time doing IM; before
you know it, half of your life could pass you by (not a pleasant thought).
 Drive safely. Tuck away your BlackBerry whenever you’re in the 
driver’s seat.

t’s hard to believe that just over ten years ago, more folks didn’t have
access to the Internet than did. Today, you can surf the Web anytime, any-
where, and you can do it using a traditional desktop or laptop computer, or
even a tiny mobile device such as a PDA or a SmartPhone. Having said that, it
should be no surprise that your BlackBerry has a Web browser of its own.
In this chapter, we explore ways to use the BlackBerry Browser effectively.
We offer shortcuts that improve your experience browsing the Web. We also
throw in timesaving tips, including the coolest ways to customize your
browser to make pages load faster and a complete neat-freak’s guide to man-
aging your bookmarks.
Your network service provider might also have its own custom browser for
you to use. We compare these proprietary browsers with the default
BlackBerry Browser so that you can decide which best suits your needs.

Getting Started with the 
BlackBerry Browser
The BlackBerry Browser or Internet Browser is preloaded on your BlackBerry
and accesses the Web by cellphone connection. When you run your BlackBerry
on BlackBerry Enterpriser Server (BES; see Chapter 1 for more BES info), the
application is called BlackBerry Browser; otherwise, it’s called Internet Browser.
We just use Browser to make things easier.
The BlackBerry supports two browsers: one that’s connected to your BES
server and one that goes directly to your service provider’s network. If you are
a corporate BlackBerry user, your company administrator might turn off or not
install the browser provided by the network service provider. The browser that
comes with your network service provider might be called by its brand name.
The following sections get you started using Browser. After you get your feet
wet, we promise that you’ll be chomping at the bit to find out more!
Accessing Browser
Browser is one of the main applications of your device, with its Globe icon
visible right on the Home screen, as shown in Figure 9-1. In most cases, you
open Browser by scrolling to this icon and then pressing the trackwheel.
204
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 
Small screen, small images
Like other similar devices, the BlackBerry has
limited screen real estate and should not be
compared with personal computers in terms of
a Web-browsing experience. The screen is just
too small to accommodate a normal Web page.
Also, remember that your connection is via a
cellphone network, so your connection speed
varies from location to location and isn’t as
speedy as a Wi-Fi or cable connection. Pictures
and images won’t look the same, and pages
might take longer to load depending on the size
of the Web page.
The good news is that you don’t have to endure
nasty pop-ups. Still, despite this limited capac-
ity (compared with a traditional Web browser),
when you really need information and you’re
away from a computer, your BlackBerry is there
for you.

If Browser is your default browser, you can access it from any application
that distinguishes a Web address. For example, from Address Book, you can
open Browser by opening the link on the Web Page field. If you get an e-mail
containing a Web address, just scroll to that link. The link is highlighted, and
you can open the page by pressing the trackwheel and then choosing Get
Link from the menu that follows.
When you access Browser from another application, you don’t have to close
that application to jump to Browser. Just press ALT (the half moon button)
and press ESCAPE to bring up a pop-up screen with application icons.
Browser is the Globe icon, as shown in Figure 9-2. Use your trackwheel to
highlight the Browser icon and then press to launch Browser.
By default, accessing Browser by clicking a Web address within another applica-
tion opens the Web page associated with that address. Opening Browser by
clicking its icon on the Home screen gives you either the default home page or a
list of bookmarks, depending on the version of the BlackBerry OS.

Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave

If you haven’t yet added bookmarks, the opening Browser screen looks like
Figure 9-3. You can find out more about adding bookmarks later in this chapter.
Hitting the (air)waves
After you open Browser, you’re ready to surf the Web. Here’s how:
1. Open Browser.
More recent versions of the BlackBerry OS display your bookmarks
when you open Browser; older versions display the home page.
2. Press the trackwheel and choose Go To from the menu that opens.
3. In the screen that appears, enter a Web address, as shown in Figure 9-4.

206

4. Click OK.
The Web page appears.
When you see a phone number or an e-mail address on a Web page, you can
scroll to that information to highlight it. When the information is highlighted,
pressing ENTER initiates a phone call or opens a new e-mail message
(depending on which type of link you highlighted).
Navigating Web pages
Using Browser to navigate a Web page is easy. Note that hyperlinks are high-
lighted onscreen. To jump to a particular hyperlink, scroll to the highlighted
link and press ENTER.
Here are few shortcuts you can use while navigating a Web page:
 For 7100’s quickly move up and down one full display page at a time by
pressing 9 (down arrow) or 3 (up arrow). For 7200s, use SPACE/
SHIFT+SPACE.
 Quickly switch between full-screen mode and normal mode in a 7100 by
pressing the exclamation point (!) key. Think of full-screen mode simply
as another way to view the same Web page on your BlackBerry, but the
BlackBerry doesn’t show anything extra (for example, signals level) on the
top portion of the display screen. Normal mode is what you get by default.
 To stop loading a page, press ESCAPE.
 After a page fully loads, go back to the previous page by pressing ESCAPE.
And don’t forget the Browser menu (press the trackwheel). It has some useful
shortcuts, as shown in Figure 9-5.

 Find: Use this option to find text within the current page. Like any other
basic Find tool, choosing this option displays a prompt to enter the text
you want to find. Then a Find Next menu appears after the initial search
for you to use to find the next matching text.
 Copy: Choosing this option copies text you highlight into memory so
that you can use it later for pasting somewhere else, like putting it in
your MemoPad.
 Get Link: This menu item shows up if you have a currently highlighted
link. Choosing this menu item opens that page of the link. Hint: The
faster way to open a link is to press ENTER, as we mention earlier.
 Home: This is the shortcut to go to your home page. The default home
page can vary from carrier to carrier, but you can change it by bringing
up the Browser menu and choosing Options➪Browser Configuration.
From there, you can change the Home Page Address field.
 Go To: Choosing this allows you to open a Web page by entering the
Web address and clicking OK. As you enter more addresses, the ones
you entered before are listed and stored for possible future usage, to
save you having to type them again. To find out how to clear that list,
see the “Cache Operations” section.
 Back <Esc>: Choose this to go back to the previous page you viewed.
When you see <Esc>, you can achieve the same function by pressing
ESCAPE.
 Forward: If you’ve gone back at least one Web page in your browsing
travels, use Forward to progress one page at a time.
 History: Browser can track up to 20 pages of Web addresses you’ve vis-
ited, which you can view on the History screen. From there, you can
jump to any of those Web pages by highlighting the history page and
press the ENTER key twice.
 Refresh: Choosing this option updates the current page. This is helpful
when you’re viewing a page with data that changes frequently (like stock
quotes).
 Set Encoding: Choose this to specify the encoding used in viewing a
Web page. This is useful when viewing foreign languages that use differ-
ent characters. Most of us don’t have to deal with this and probably
don’t know what type of encoding a particular language could display. If
you have to do this, make sure you know the appropriate encoding.
When you try to open a Web page, indicators appear at the bottom of the
screen that tells you the progress of your request. The left screen in Figure 9-6
shows that Browser is requesting a page from the Business and Finance link.
The right screen of Figure 9-6 shows that you’ve reached the page and that
the page is still loading.
208
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

At the upper-right corner of both screens are a couple of icons. The right-
most icon shows the strength of the network signals (it’s the same signal indi-
cator for phone and e-mail). The icon to the left of that indicates whether
you’re at a secure Web page. In this case, it is a normal page. Whether a page
is secure or not depends on the Web site you’re visiting. If you’re accessing
banking information, you most likely see the secured icon (a closed lock). On
the other hand, most informational pages need not be secure, so you see the
unsecured icon (an open lock). Hint: The Web address of a secure page
starts with https instead of http.
If you lose patience waiting for a page to load and want to browse somewhere
else, press ESCAPE to stop the page from loading.
Saving a Web page address
Entering a Web address to view a page can get tedious. Fortunately, you can
return to a page without manually entering the same address. While you’re
viewing a Web page, simply use the Browser menu (shown in Figure 9-7) to
save that page’s address.

209
Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave

You can save a Web page address in a couple of ways:
 Page Address: This option allows you to view the Web address of the
current page through a pop-up screen. From this pop-up screen, you can
save the page’s address on your BlackBerry clipboard and paste it in as
a Memo for yourself or send it to yourself or somebody else via
Messages (e-mail). Convenient, right?
 Send Address: When you choose Send Address from the pop-up menu,
you’re taken to Address Book to select your e-mail recipient, and the
rest is the same as sending a regular e-mail. See Chapter 7 for more on
sending e-mail messages.
 Save Page: Use this option to save the Web address of the current page
to Messages. A message appears with the Browser globe icon to indicate
that it’s a Web link, as shown in Figure 9-8. Scrolling to that entry and
pressing ENTER launches Browser and opens the page for your viewing
pleasure. Saving a page to your message list has a different purpose than
bookmarking a page. When you save a page to your message list, you
can mark the page as unread, like an e-mail message, to remind yourself
to check back later.
Note: When you do not have network coverage and you try to access a Web
page, you’re prompted to save your request. When you do, it automatically
saves your request in the message list and when you do have coverage later,
you can open the same Web page from the message list, and it has the loaded
content already! 
Pressing a letter key while you are on a menu selects the first menu item that
starts with that letter. Pressing the same letter again selects the next menu
item that starts with that letter.

Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

Sending an address by e-mail
You can send a Web address to any recipient via an e-mail through the Page
Address option from the Browser menu. For a more direct way, simply choose
Send Address from the Browser menu while the Web page is displayed. If you
know right away that you’re going to send an address to someone, use the
more direct method. It saves you a couple of clicks.
Saving Web images
If you have a BlackBerry with a color screen, you can view and save pictures
or images from a Web page. You can save images of JPEG, PNG, GIF, and BMP
formats. Any image that is saved is kept in the Pictures application, which
enables you to view it later, even when you are out of coverage. To save it
from the Web page, click the image you want to save and then choose Save
Image from the menu that appears.
Bookmarking Your Favorite Sites
You don’t have to memorize each address of your favorite sites. Your browser
allows you to keep a list of sites you want to revisit. In other words, make a
bookmark so you can come back to a site quickly.
211
Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
Changing your Home screen background
This is a neat trick. You can use an image that
you have saved on your pictures list as the
background on your Home screen. Here’s how:
1. From the Home screen, scroll to the
Pictures icon and press the trackwheel.
The Pictures application opens.
Note: Depending on the BlackBerry theme,
some versions of the theme call Pictures 
by the name Photo Album. On the 7100 
series, you can find Photo Album within
Applications.
2. Scroll to and click the image you want to
set as your background. Press the track-
wheel and a context menu appears.
3. From the context menu, choose the Set As
Home Screen Image option.

Adding a bookmark
On the page you want to bookmark, choose Add Bookmark from the Browser
menu. Remember that the menu is always accessible by pressing the track-
wheel. Enter the name of the bookmark and then select the folder where you
want to save the bookmark in the Bookmark dialog box (as shown in Figure 9-9).
The default folder is BlackBerry Bookmarks, but you can save it in folders that
you create. To see how to create a bookmark folder, skip to the section, “Adding
a bookmark subfolder.”
The next time you want to go to a bookmarked page, return to the Bookmarks
screen by choosing Bookmarks from the Browser menu. From this screen,
you can find all the pages you bookmarked. Just highlight the name of the
bookmark and press ENTER to open that page.
Available offline
The Bookmark dialog box includes an Available Offline check box, which you
might be wondering about. If that check box is checked, you not only save a
page as bookmark, you are also caching it so you can view it even when out
of network coverage (like being stuck deep in a mountain cave). So next time
you click the bookmark, that page comes up very fast. 
We recommend you make bookmarks to search engines (such as Google)
available offline because the content of the initial search page is not likely to
change from day to day.
If you’re working with version 3.8 or higher of the BlackBerry OS, the
Bookmarks screen appears by default when you open Browser.
Figure 9-9:
Specify the
name and
the folder in
which to

212
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

Modifying a bookmark
Changing a bookmark is a snap:
1. Go to the Bookmarks screen.
To open the Bookmarks screen, choose Bookmarks from the Browser
menu.
2. Highlight the name of the bookmark you want to modify and then
choose Edit Bookmark on the menu.
3. On the screen that follows, you can edit the existing name and/or the
address the bookmark is pointing to.
4. Click OK to save your changes.
Organizing your bookmarks
Over time, the number of your bookmarks will grow, and having a tiny display
screen can make it tough to find a certain site. To mitigate this problem, orga-
nize your bookmarks by using folders. For example, you can group related
sites in a folder, and each folder can have one or more folders inside it (sub-
folders). In a way, you can build a tree hierarchy for your bookmarks. Having
a folder hierarchy narrows down your search and allows you to easily find
the site you’re looking for.
Adding a bookmark subfolder
Unfortunately, you can only add subfolders to existing folders that are
already listed on the Bookmarks page. Nevertheless, you can still get orga-
nized by using subfolders.
Suppose that you want to add a subfolder called Favorites within your
BlackBerry Bookmarks folder. Here are the quick and easy steps:
1. On the Bookmarks screen, highlight BlackBerry Bookmarks.
The initial folder you highlight is the parent of the new subfolder. So in this
case, the BlackBerry Bookmarks folder contains the Favorites subfolder.
2. Press the trackwheel and choose Add Subfolder from the menu that
appears, as shown in Figure 9-10.
213
Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave

You see a dialog box where you can enter the name of the folder.
3. Enter the name of the folder (as shown in Figure 9-11) and click OK.
We name our folder Favorites.
The Favorites folder appears on the Bookmarks screen (as in Figure 9-12),
bearing a folder icon.

Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

Renaming a bookmark folder
Renaming a bookmark folder is as easy as editing a bookmark. On the
Bookmarks screen, highlight the name of the folder, press the trackwheel,
and choose Rename Folder from the menu that appears. On the screen that
follows, you can edit the name of the folder. After renaming, you can click OK
to save the changes.
Moving your bookmarks
If you keep going astray looking for a bookmark that you think exists in a par-
ticular folder but is instead in another, move that bookmark where it should
belong:
1. Highlight the bookmark, press the trackwheel, and choose Move
Bookmark from the menu that appears.
2. Use the trackwheel to move the bookmark to the location on the list
where you want it to appear.
3. After you find the right location, press the trackwheel.
Your bookmark is in its new home.
Cleaning up your bookmarks
Cleaning up your bookmarks list can help you keep organized and is way easy.
On the Bookmarks screen, highlight the name of the bookmark you want to
delete, press the trackwheel, and choose Delete Bookmark from the menu that
appears.
You can clean up bookmarks wholesale by deleting an entire folder. However,
if you delete a folder, you delete the contents of that folder as well, so purge
with caution.
Browser Options and Optimization
Techniques
On the latest version of BlackBerry OS (version 4.0, as of the writing of this
book), you’ll find that Web browsing is extremely slow because Research In
Motion (RIM) added many improvements on the application. That sounds like
an oxymoron — slow is an improvement? Hold on a second so we can explain.
From v. 4.0 and higher, the Browser supports much better HTML (HyperText
Markup Language) tables, JavaScript, and Cascading Style Sheets. It also sup-
ports more image formats. With every new feature RIM adds, more process-
ing time is required, which can result in degradation of performance. To
compensate for this slowdown, RIM allows you to control which features are
active through the Browser Options screen, which is accessible via the
215
Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave

Browser menu. (Just press the trackwheel to open the menu and choose
Options.) If you still feel speed-greedy after adjusting the options, see the
upcoming sidebar, “Speeding up browsing.”
The Browser Options screen offers three main categories to choose from, as
shown in Figure 9-13:
Browser Configuration
You can define browser-specific settings from the Browser Configuration
screen, which you access from the Browser Options screen. The list of cus-
tomization items you can amend (shown in Figure 9-14) are the following:
 Setting up your home page
 Setting the content mode you want viewed: WML, HTML, or both
Think of WML pages as Web pages made just for mobile device such as
the BlackBerry. We recommend you leave this as WML or both.
 Controlling the display of images depending on the content mode
 Turning on/off the display of image placeholders if you opt to not dis-
play images
 Specifying which browser type your browser emulates
The default is BlackBerry, but Browser can emulate Microsoft Internet
Explorer, Openwave (WAP), Openwave Gateway, Microsoft Pocket IE, or
Netscape. We don’t see much difference on the behavior, so we recom-
mend that you stick with the default BlackBerry mode.
Figure 9-13:

Browser
Options

Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

General Properties
The General Properties screen has the same function as the Browser
Configuration screen (see the preceding section) in that you can customize
some behaviors of Browser. This screen, however, is geared more toward the
features of the browser content. As shown in Figure 9-15, you can configure
or turn on/off more features.
From this screen, you use the SPACE key to change the value of a field. You
can configure the following features by selecting from the provided choices.
Following this list are the General Properties screen options that you config-
ure via on/off toggles.

Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave

 Enable/disable prompting when closing the browser
You can be notified before you do the following actions as a precaution:
• Closing Browser on Escape: Notified right before you exit
BlackBerry Browser (if you’ve pressed the ESCAPE key to exit).
• Closing Modified Pages: Notified right before you exit a modified
Web page (for example, some type of online form you fill out)
• Running WML Scripts: Notified right before a WML script runs.
 Change the default font and font size
You can change these setting by first highlighting them one at a time and
then pressing the ALT key, which displays a list of available choices.
Then scroll to the choices that you like and press ENTER or the track-
wheel to confirm.
 Support of HTML tables
A page with HTML tables might look different when this is disabled.
 Use of foreground and background colors
 Use of background images
 Support of embedded media such as Flash and SVG
SVG stands for scalable vector graphics. Think of it as Flash for mobile
devices such as the BlackBerry. It can be a still image or an animated one.
 Support of JavaScript
A Web page might not behave normally when this option is off.
 Enable/suppressed JavaScript pop-ups
 Support of Cascading Style Sheets
 Set the number of times an animation repeats
The default is 100 Times but you can change this setting to Never, Once,
10 Times, 100 Times, or as many as the image specifies.
Cache Operations
At any given time, your BlackBerry uses a few cache mechanisms. When you
visit a site that uses cookies (think of a cookie as a piece of text that a Web
site created and placed in your BlackBerry’s memory to remember something
about you), Browser caches that cookie. Browser also caches pages and con-
tents so that you can view them offline — which is handy when you’re out of
coverage range. Also, the addresses of the pages that you visited (or your
latest 20 on your History) comprise a cache. Depending on the usage of your
browser, you might or might not see the three actions shown in Figure 9-16.

Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave
Speeding up browsing
When you’re running the latest version of
BlackBerry OS (version 4.0 or higher), you might
find that browsing the Web is extremely slow.
You can make your pages load faster in
exchange for not using a few of the features.
Here are some of the techniques you can use:
 Don’t display images. You can see a big
performance improvement by turning off
the display of images. From the Browser
menu, choose Browser Options➪Browser
Configuration, scroll to Show Images, and
change the value to No.
 Make sure you’re not low on/out of
memory. When your BlackBerry is very low
in memory, its performance degrades. The
BlackBerry low-memory manager calls
each application every now and then telling
each one to free up resources.
Hint #1: Don’t leave many e-mail messages
unread. When the low-memory manager
kicks in, Messages tries to delete old mes-
sages, but it cannot delete those that are
unread.
Hint #2: You can also clean up the
BlackBerry event log on some devices to
free up needed space. Enter the letters
LGLG while holding the SHIFT key. This
brings up an event log where you can clear
events to free up memory.
 Turn off other features. If you’re mostly
interested in viewing contents, consider
turning off features that pertain to how the
content is processed, such as Support
HTML Tables, Use Background Images,
Support JavaScript, Allow JavaScript
Popups, and Support Style Sheets. To turn
off other browser features, navigate to
Browser Options➪General Properties.
Warning: We don’t advise turning off fea-
tures while performing an important task
such as online banking. If you do, you might
not be able to perform some of the actions
on the page. For example, the Submit button
might not work.

To perform one of the actions shown in Figure 9-16, simply highlight it and
press the trackwheel. The three options and their actions are
 Clear Content Cache: This clears any offline content you might have.
You might want to do this because you’re running out of space on your
BlackBerry, and you need to free some memory. Or it can be that you’re
tired of viewing old content or tired of pressing the Refresh option.
 Clear Cookie Cache: This clears any cookies that are stored on your
BlackBerry. You might want to do this for security’s sake. You sometimes
don’t want a Web site to remember you.
 Clear History: This clears the list of sites you have visited using the Go
To function. You might want to clear this for the sake of security if you
don’t want other people knowing which Web sites you’re visiting on
your BlackBerry.
Installing (And Uninstalling)
Applications from the Web
You can download and install applications on your BlackBerry by using
Browser, providing that whoever published the application on the Web has a
link that enables you to download the appropriate files and install them. The
downloading and installing part is easy — just click the link from Browser, and
it displays a simple prompt that looks like the screen shown in Figure 9-17.
Click the Download button to start the download.
As long as you stay within network coverage while the download is progress-
ing, your BlackBerry can finish the download and install the application for
you. If it finishes without any problem, you see a screen similar to Figure 9-18.
Figure 9-17:
Showing 
a typical
downloading
page on a
BlackBerry.
220
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

Like with a desktop computer, the download might or might not work for a
variety of reasons. Sometimes the application requires that you install
libraries, and sometimes the application works only on a certain version of
the BlackBerry OS. These issues can be prevented, depending on the sophisti-
cation of the site where the link is published. In most reputable sources, these
issues are considered — and successful download and installation is a snap.
Installing applications from non-reputable sources can cause your BlackBerry
to become unstable. Before you download an application from the Web, be
sure to read reviews about that particular application. Most of the time, other
people who tried the software provide reviews or feedback. Don’t be the first
to write the bad review!
You BES Administrator can disable the feature in your BlackBerry to download
and install an application. This is mostly the case for a company-issued device.
If you have problems downloading and installing an application, check your
company policy or contact the BlackBerry support person in your company.
If you download an application that turns out to be a dud, you need to uninstall
it. See Chapter 12 for more on uninstalling an application from your BlackBerry.
Browser’s Behavior on an 
Enterprise Environment
Getting a device from your employer has both a good and an ugly side. On
the good side, your company foots the bill. On the bad side, your company
foots the bill. Because your company pays for the bill, the company has a say
on what you can and can’t do on your BlackBerry device. This is especially
true with respect to browsing the Web.
Depending on your company’s policy, you might or might not get a browser that
comes with the network service provider. Two scenarios come into play when it
Figure 9-18:
Showing a
download/
installation
has been
completed.
221
Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave

comes to your browser. On an Enterprise environment, a browser might be run-
ning under your company’s BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES). With this setup,
your BlackBerry Browser is connecting to the Internet by using your company’s
Internet connection. It’s like using your desktop machine at work.
The second scenario is where your browser isn’t connected to your com-
pany’s BES but through a network service provider. Most of the time, a
provider has a version of the browser branded to its name. In most cases,
your device fits on only one scenario, which is the case where your browser
is connected through your company’s BES server. Some lucky folks might
have both. Whatever scenario you’re in, the following sections describe the
major differences between the two and what you can expect.
Using Browser on your company’s BES
On an Enterprise setup, your BlackBerry Browser is connected through your
company’s BES server. With this setup, the browser is actually named as
BlackBerry Browser. BES is located inside your company’s intranet. This
setup allows the company to better manage the privileges and the functions
you can use on your device.
For the BlackBerry Browser application, this setup allows the company to
use the existing Internet infrastructure, including the company’s firewall.
Because you are within the company’s network, the boundaries that your net-
work administrator set up on your account apply to your BlackBerry as well.
For example, when browsing the Web, your BlackBerry won’t display any
Web sites that are blocked by your company’s proxy server. The good thing,
though, is that you can browse through the company’s intranet.
Pay attention to your company’s Web browsing policy. Most companies keep
logs of the sites you view on your browser and might even have software to
monitor usage.
Also, if your company’s proxy settings don’t allow downloading from the Web,
your device can’t download and install anything coming from the Web.
Remember that installation of software into your device not only depends on
your download privileges, but it also depends on the IT policy that is assigned
to your ID on the BES console by your company’s BES Administrator.
Using your network provider’s browser
Any new device coming from a network service provider can come with its own
branded Web browser. It’s the same BlackBerry Browser, but the behavior might
differ from the standard one. For one, the name is different, and the default home
page usually points to the provider’s Web site. This is not necessarily a bad
thing. Most of the time, the network provider’s Web site is also rich with links
222
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

that you might not find on RIM’s portal. But this is just a minor difference. The
major difference is that because this browser isn’t on your company’s BES but on
your provider’s network, you have more freedom on what sites to browse. You’re
not limited by your company’s policy on browsing. In this case, privacy is king.
Most of the time, if your browser is through BES, surfing the Web is much
faster. This is not true in all cases, however, because the network bandwidth
of your BES affects the speed.
Setting the default browser
If you have two Web browsers on your device, you have the option to set the
default browser. This comes into play when you view a Web address using a
link outside the browser application. For example, when you view a contact
with a Web page in the Address Book, the Address Book menu contains a Get
Link option. Clicking Get Link launches the default browser.
To set up the default browser, from your Home screen, navigate to (Options)
Settings➪Browser. (If you have a 7100 model, the Settings option is located in
Tools.) Use the SPACE key to change the value of the default browser. Figure
9-19 shows the Browser Settings screen with the default browser selected.
Using Password Keeper
Suppose you’re in front of an Internet browser, trying to access an online
account. For the life of you, you just can’t remember the user name that
matches your password. It’s your third login attempt, and if you fail this time,
your online account is locked. Then you have to call the customer hotline
and wait hours before you can speak to a representative. Argghh. We’ve all
done it. Luckily, the folks at RIM created an application just for people like you
(and us) so you never get locked out of your own online accounts again — and
yet keep intruders at bay.
Figure 9-19:
Use the
SPACE key
to change
the value of
the default
browser.
223
Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave

Password Keeper is the simple, yet very practical BlackBerry application that
makes your life that much easier.
Accessing Password Keeper
On the 7100 model, depending on what theme you have, Password Keeper is
filed in Application (under Tools, for the T-Mobile theme). If you have a model
other than 7100, Password Keeper is visible right on your Home screen.
Not all BlackBerry models come with Password Keeper out of the box. You
may need to specifically request that your service provider install it on your
BlackBerry. It is free, though.
Setting a password for Password Keeper
The very first time you access Password Keeper, you’re prompted to enter a
password. Please be sure to remember the password you choose because this
is the password to all your passwords. In addition, you are prompted to enter
this master password every single time you access Password Keeper.
We know it sounds perverse to set up yet another password to help you
manage your passwords, but trust us. Having to remember just one password
is a lot easier than having to remember seventeen.
Creating new credentials
Okay, so you’re ready to fire up your handy dandy Password Keeper applica-
tion. Now, what kinds of things does it expect you to do in order for it to work
its magic? Obviously, you’re going to need to collect the pertinent info for all
your various password-protected accounts so that you can store them within
the protected environs of Password Keeper. So, when creating a new pass-
word entry, be sure you have the following information (see Figure 9-20):
 Title: This one’s pretty straightforward. Just come up with a name to de-
scribe the password-protected account — My Bank Account, for example.
 Username: This is where you enter the user name for the account.
 Password: Enter the password for the account here.
 Website: Put the Web site address (its URL) here.
 Notes: Not exactly crucial, but the Notes field does give you a bit of
room to add a comment or two.
224
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

The only required field to enter is Title, but a title alone usually isn’t of much
use to you. We suggest that you fill in as much other information here as pos-
sible, but at the same time be discreet about those locations where you use your
user name and password — so don’t put anything in the Website field or use
My eBay Account as a title. That way, if someone does somehow gain access
to your password to Password Keeper, the intruder will have a hard time fig-
uring out where exactly to use your credentials.
Random Password generation
If you’re the kind of person who uses one password for everything but knows
deep in your heart that this is just plain wrong, wrong, wrong, Random
Password generation is for you. It is quite simple. When creating a new pass-
word for yet another online account (or when changing your password for an
online account you already have), fire up Password Keeper, press the track-
wheel, and then choose Random Password from the menu that appears. Voilà!
A new password is automatically generated for you, as shown in Figure 9-21.
Figure 9-21:
Showing a
randomly
generated
password.
Figure 9-20:
Set your
master
password
here.
225
Chapter 9: Surfing the Internet Wave

Using Random Password generation makes sense in conjunction with
Password Keeper because you don’t have to remember the randomly gener-
ated password Password Keeper came up with for any of your online
accounts — that’s Password Keeper’s job.
Using your password
The whole point of Password Keeper is to let your BlackBerry’s electronic
brain do your password remembering for you. So, imagine this scenario: You
can no longer live without owning your personal copy of the A Chipmunk
Christmas CD, so you surf on over to your favorite online music store and
attempt to log in. You draw a blank on your password, but instead of
seething, you take out your BlackBerry, open the Password Keeper applica-
tion, and do a search. Like Address Book (see Chapter 3), you just type the
first letters of your account title in the Find field to search for the title of your
password. After you find (and highlight) the title, you press the trackwheel
and choose View, as shown in see Figure 9-22. The screen for your account
displays, conveniently listing that password that was just on the tip of your
tongue. All you have to do now is enter the password into the login screen for
that online music store and Alvin, Simon, and Theodore will soon be wending
their way to your address, ready to sing “Chipmunk Jingle Bells.”
Yes, you do have the option of copying and pasting your password from
Password Keeper to another application — your BlackBerry Browser, for
instance. Just highlight the password name, press the trackwheel, and
choose Copy to Clipboard from the menu that appears. Then navigate to
where you want to enter to password, press the trackwheel, and choose
Paste from the context menu. Keep in mind, in order for the copy/paste func-
tion to work for passwords from Password Keeper, you need to enable the
Allow Clipboard Copy option in the Password Keeper options (see the
upcoming Table 9-1).

After you paste your password in another application, clear the Clipboard by
pressing the trackwheel and choosing Clear Clipboard. The Clipboard keeps
your last copied password until you clear it.
You can copy and paste only one password at a time.
Password Keeper options
The Password Keeper’s Options menu allows you to control how it behaves.
For example, you can set what characters can make up a randomly generated
password. See Table 9-1 for a listing of all options as well as descriptions of
each one.

P
hone capability has been incorporated into BlackBerry pretty much from
the very first generations of the device. The really great news is that the
BlackBerry phone operates no differently than any other phone that you’ve used.
So why bother with this chapter? Although your BlackBerry phone operates
like any other phone that you’re used to, it has capabilities that far outreach
those of your run-of-the-mill cellphone. For example, when’s the last time that
your phone is connected to your to-do list? Have you ever received an e-mail
and placed a call directly from that e-mail? We didn’t think so. But with your
BlackBerry, you can do all these things and more.
In this chapter, we first cover some phone basics and then show you some of
the neat ways how BlackBerry Phone intertwines with other BlackBerry
applications and functions.
Using the BlackBerry Phone Application
Accessing the Phone application from the 7100 models is a snap. From the
Home screen, pressing any of the numeric keys brings you right into the
BlackBerry Phone application. Or, if you prefer, you can press the green Send
button located right below the display screen to get into the Phone application.

From the 72xx models, you can get to Phone in a couple of ways. You can
scroll to the Phone icon on the Home screen and press the trackwheel to
enter the Phone application. Or you can press any of the numeric keys. In
order to do this, however, you have to make sure that the Dial from Home
Screen option is enabled within the Phone option. If you’re a heavy phone
user on the 72xx models, we recommend that you enable this option.
To enable dialing from Home screen
1. From the Home screen, scroll to Phone application and press the
trackwheel.
Phone opens, showing the dial screen as well as your call history list.
2. Press the trackwheel and select Options from the contextual menu.
Doing so displays a list of options.
3. Scroll to General Options and press the trackwheel.
A list of general options appears.
4. Scroll down to Dial from Home Screen option, press the trackwheel,
select Change Option, and choose Yes from the drop-down list.
This enables you to make a phone call by pressing the numeric keys
when at the Home screen.
5. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackwheel. From the contex-
tual menu that appears, choose Save.
Throughout this section, we assume that you have Dial from Home Screen
enabled if you’re using a 72xx model.
Making and Receiving Calls
The folks at RIM have created an intuitive user interface to all the essential
Phone features, including how to make a call.
Making a call
In order to make a call
1. From the Home screen or the Phone application, dial the desired des-
tination number.
As you type the first number, Phone opens (if it isn’t open already) and
displays the numbers you dialed.
230
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

2. Press the trackwheel and choose Call.
The call is initiated.
On the 7100 models, you can also press the green Send button to initiate
the call.
Calling from the Address Book
Because you can’t possibly remember all your friends’ and colleagues’ phone
numbers, calling from the Address Book is very convenient and useful.
To call from the Address Book from the Phone application
1. Open the Phone application. Press the trackwheel to bring up the
Phone menu (see Figure 10-1).
Doing so opens the Phone menu.
2. From the menu, choose Call from Address Book.
Address Book opens. From here, you can search as usual for the contact
you’d like to call.
3. From Address Book, scroll to your call recipient and press the track-
wheel to choose Call.
This makes the call.
Dialing letters
One of the nice features of the BlackBerry Phone is that you can dial letters,
and BlackBerry will figure out the corresponding number. (For this to work
on a 7100 series device, you have to use multitap rather than SureType.) For
example, to dial 1-800-11-LEARN, do the following on your BlackBerry:
Figure 10-1:
The Phone
menu.
231
Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person

1. From the Home screen or the Phone application, dial 1-8-0-0-1-1.
As you type the first number, the Phone application opens (if it isn’t
opened already) and displays the numbers you dialed.
2. Press and hold the ALT key and then dial (press) L-E-A-R-N.
You can see the letters appearing onscreen as you type, as shown in
Figure 10-2.
3. Press the trackwheel and choose Call.
This call is initiated.
Calling from the history list
When you open the BlackBerry Phone application, you see your phone his-
tory list, as shown in Figure 10-3. This screen shows calls that are made or
received from your BlackBerry. If you received a voice mail or missed a call, it
appears here, too.
You can also dial straight from the phone history list by scrolling to the
number on the history list, pressing the trackwheel once (a context menu
appears), and selecting Call from the contextual menu.
Figure 10-2:

Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

Receiving a call
Receiving a call on your BlackBerry is even easier than making a call. You can
receive calls in a couple of ways. One is by using your BlackBerry’s auto-
mated answering feature, and the other is by answering the calls manually.
Automated answering is triggered whenever you take your BlackBerry out
from your holster; in other words, just taking the BlackBerry out forces it to
auto-pick up any call, so you can start talking right away The disadvantage of
this is that you don’t have time to see who is calling you (on your caller ID).
Note: To disable auto-answering, just be sure your BlackBerry isn’t in its hol-
ster when an incoming call arrives; your calls won’t be auto-answered, and
you would need to answer it manually.
What’s the advantage of disabling auto-answering? Well, manual answering
prompts you to answer a call or ignore a call when you receive an incoming
call, as shown in Figure 10-4. This way, you can see who is calling you, on
your caller ID, before you decide to pick up or ignore the call.

Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person

Phone Options While on a Call
When you are on the phone, situations might arise where you’d want to mute
your conversation or change the call volume. No problem. BlackBerry makes
such adjustments easy.
Muting your call
While on a call with someone, you might decide to put the call on mute so the
other person on the line can’t hear you. It’s an alternative to placing your
caller on hold; however, unlike placing your caller on hold, you can still hear
the caller’s voice. So when would you use this feature? And why not just use
the hold feature?
You might want to use the mute feature while on a conference call (see the
upcoming section, “Arranging Conference Calls”) when you don’t need to
speak but do need to hear what is being discussed. Maybe you’re on the bus
or have kids in the background, making your surroundings noisy. But by using
mute, all the background noises are filtered out from the conference call. 
To mute your call
1. While in a conversation, press the trackwheel.
The Phone menu appears in all its glory.
2. Scroll to Mute and press the trackwheel.
You will hear a tone sound, indicating that your call is on mute.
Figure 10-4:
Ignore or
answer with
manual
answering.
234
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

To un-mute your call
1. While a call is on mute, press the trackwheel.
The Phone menu makes another appearance.
2. Scroll to Turn Mute Off and press the trackwheel.
You will hear a tone sound, indicating that your call is now un-muted.
Placing your call on hold
Unlike muting a call, placing a call on hold prohibits both you and your caller
from hearing one another.
To put a conversation on hold:
1. While in a conversation, press the trackwheel.
The Phone menu appears yet again.
2. Scroll to Hold and press the trackwheel.
Your call is now on hold.
To un-hold your call
1. While a call is on hold, press the trackwheel.
A new menu appears.
2. Scroll to Resume and press the trackwheel.
You can continue your conversation again.
Adjusting the call volume
Adjusting the call volume, a simple yet important action on your BlackBerry
phone, can be performed by simply scrolling the trackwheel up or down to
adjust the volume up or down, respectively, while on a phone call.
You can also have a preset default volume level every time you pick or place
a call. To set a default volume level
1. Open Phone, press the trackwheel, and choose Options from the con-
textual menu that appears.
A list of phone options appears.
235
Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person

2. From the Options screen, scroll to General Options and press the
trackwheel.
This opens the General Options screen.
3. Scroll to Default Call Volume, press the trackwheel, and choose
Change Option from the contextual screen.
This opens up a drop-down list, containing preset default volume rang-
ing from 25% to 100% in intervals of 25. The drop-down list also contains
a choice called Previous, which means that your default phone volume
will be at the volume setting from your last call.
4. Choose a volume of your choice and press the trackwheel.
5. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackwheel again and 
choosing Save.
Customizing the BlackBerry Phone
In order for your BlackBerry Phone to work the way you like, you have to first
set it up the way you want it. So when you are busy rushing from point A to
point B you can count on your BlackBerry to work like it should. In this sec-
tion, we will go through some settings that can make you the master of your
BlackBerry Phone.
Setting up your voice mail number
This section shows you how to set up your voice mail access number.
Unfortunately, the instructions for setting up your voice mailbox vary,
depending on your service provider. Fortunately, however, most service
providers are more than happy to walk you through the steps to get your
mailbox set up in a jiffy.
To set up your voice mail number
1. Open the Phone application, press the trackwheel, and choose Options.
A list of phone options appears.
2. Scroll to Voicemail and press the trackwheel.
This opens the voice mail configuration screen.
3. Scroll to access the number field and enter your voice mail access
number.
If this field is empty and you don’t know this number, contact your serv-
ice provider and ask for your voice mail access number.
236
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

Setting up call waiting
Call waiting is one of those phone features that you just can’t live without if
you’re constantly on the phone. To change your call waiting setting, you must be
within your network coverage because the BlackBerry has to communicate with
the BlackBerry server. (This feature might not be available on all networks.)
After you’re within network coverage, you can change your call waiting set-
tings by doing the following:
1. Open the Phone application, press the trackwheel, and choose Options.
A list of phone options appears.
2. Scroll to Call Waiting and press the trackwheel.
Your BlackBerry attempts to connect with the network. If the connection
is successful, you see the call waiting screen with one field named Call
Waiting Enabled.
If you don’t see the call waiting screen, you might need to wait until you
have network coverage and then try again.
3. Scroll to the Call Waiting Enabled field, press the trackwheel once,
and choose Change Option.
A drop-down screen appears with Yes and No options.
4. Select Yes to enable calling waiting.
5. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackwheel and choosing Save.
Using call forwarding
On the BlackBerry, you have two types of call forwarding:
 Forward All Calls: Any calls to your BlackBerry are forwarded to the
number you designate. Another name for this feature is unconditional
forwarding.
 Forward Unanswered Calls: Calls that meet different types of condi-
tions are forwarded to different numbers.
For the unanswered forwarding type, here are the three conditions that deter-
mine what number to forward to. The three conditions are as follows:
 If Busy: You don’t have call waiting turned on, and you’re on the phone.
 If No Answer: You don’t hear your phone ring or somehow are unable to
pickup your phone (like when you’re in a meeting).
 If Unreachable: You’re out of network coverage and cannot receive any
signals.
237
Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person

Out of the box, your BlackBerry will forward any unanswered calls, regard-
less of conditions, to your voice mail number by default. However, you can
add new numbers to forward a call to.
Like with setting the call waiting option, you need to be within network cov-
erage before can you change your call forwarding option. After you’re within
network coverage, you can change your call forwarding settings by doing the
following:
1. Open the Phone application. Press the trackwheel and choose Options.
A list of phone options appears.
2. Scroll to Call Forwarding and press the trackwheel.
Your BlackBerry now attempts to connect with the network. If success-
ful, you’ll see the Call Forwarding screen.
If you don’t see the Call Forwarding screen, wait until you have network
coverage and try again.
3. From the call forwarding screen, press the trackwheel and choose
Edit Numbers.
A list of number(s) appears. If this is the first time you’re setting call for-
warding, mostly likely only your voice mail number is on this list.
4. To add a new forwarding number, press the trackwheel and choose
New Number.
A pop-up menu appears, prompting you to enter the new forwarding
number.
5. In the pop-up window, enter the number you want to forward to and
then press the trackwheel.
The new number you entered now appears on the call forward number list.
You can add this new number to any call forwarding types or conditions.
6. Press the ESC button.
You are returned to the Call Forwarding screen.
7. Scroll to the If Unreachable field, press the trackwheel, and then
choose Change Number.
A drop-down menu appears listing numbers from the call forwarding
number list, including the one you just added.
8. Within the drop-down list, scroll to the number you want to forward
to and then press the trackwheel.
Doing so places the selected number into the If Unreachable field. You
can see this on the call forwarding screen.
9. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackwheel and choosing Save
from the contextual menu that appears.

Configuring speed dial
Speed dial is a very convenient feature on any phone. And after you get used
to having it on a phone system, it’s hard not to use it on other phones, includ-
ing your BlackBerry phone.
Viewing speed dial list
To view your speed dial list
1. While in the Phone application, press the trackwheel to bring up its
menu.
2. From the contextual menu, choose View Speed Dial List.
This brings up list of speed dial entries, as shown in Figure 10-5. If you
haven’t set up any speed dials, this list will be mostly empty.
The number of speed dial slots varies depending on which BlackBerry
model you have. 72xx models have 26 speed dial slots; on the other
hand, 7100 models have only 9.
Adding a new number to speed dial
Setting up speed dial numbers is as easy as using them. It takes a few sec-
onds to set them up, but you benefit every time you use this feature.
To assign a number to a speed dial slot
1. Open the Phone application from the Home screen.
2. From within Phone, press the trackwheel.
Doing so brings up the contextual menu.
Figure 10-5:
The speed
dial list.
239
Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person

3. Choose View Speed Dial List.
This brings up the list of speed dial numbers you have.
4. Scroll to an empty speed dial slot, press the trackwheel to bring up a
menu, and then choose New Speed Dial.
Doing so brings you to the BlackBerry Address Book to select a con-
tact’s phone number.
5. Scroll to a contact for whom you want to add the phone number into the
speed dial list, press the trackwheel, and then choose Add Speed Dial.
The number appears in the speed dial list.
If more than one number is associated with the selected contact in the
Address Book, you’re prompted to select which number to add to the
speed dial list.
Using speed dial
After you have a few speed dial entries set up, you can start using them.
While at the Home screen or Phone application, press a speed dial key. The
call is initiated to the number associated with that particular speed dial key.
Note that on 72xx models, you need to have the Dial from Home Screen
option enabled in order to use the speed dial from the Home screen. To
enable this option, refer to beginning of this chapter in the section, “Using
the BlackBerry Phone Application.”
In the case when you press a key that doesn’t have a number set up for the
speed dial key, you are prompted to add a number to that key, as shown in
Figure 10-6. This is another way for you to add a new number to your speed
dial list.

Deleting a number from the speed dial list
To delete a number from your speed dial list, follow these steps:
1. From within Phone, press the trackwheel to bring up the contextual
menu.
2. Choose View Speed Dial List.
A list of the speed dial entries programmed into your BlackBerry
appears. (Refer to Figure 10-5.)
3. Scroll to the speed dial number that you would like to delete.
4. While the speed dial slot is highlighted, press the trackwheel to bring
up the menu and then choose Delete.
A pop-up window asks you to confirm your deletion.
5. From the pop-up window, select Delete to confirm your deletion.
This deletes the desired speed dial number.
Arranging the order of your speed dial entries
By default, your voice mail number holds the number 1 place in your speed
dial list (on the 7100 series). But maybe you want 1 to be reserved for the
number for your home, for example. Here, we show you how you can arrange
the speed dial entries in the order you want them.
To reorder the entries in your speed dial list
1. While in the Phone application, press the trackwheel to bring up the
contextual menu.
2. Choose View Speed Dial List.
This brings up a list of your speed dial numbers.
3. Scroll to the speed dial number you want to change the order of in 
the list.
4. While the speed dial slot is highlighted, press the trackwheel to bring
up the menu and then choose Move.
You see the selected speed dial slot highlighted with a different shade,
which indicates that you can move it up or down to other slots. (See
Figure 10-7.)
241
Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person

5. Use the trackwheel to scroll up or down until the speed dial number is
in a new desired slot; then press the trackwheel again.
Doing so moves the speed dial number into the new slot. If you want 
to move to an occupied slot that already has a number, you are asked
whether you want the new number to bump the old number down a space.
6. Press the ESC button to return to the Phone application.
Arranging Conference Calls
To have two or more people on the phone with you — the infamous confer-
ence call — do the following:
1. Use the Phone application to place a call to the first participant.
2. While the first participant is on the phone with you, press the track-
wheel and then choose New Call from the menu that appears, as
shown in Figure 10-8.
Figure 10-8:
The New
Call feature.
Figure 10-7:

242
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

This automatically places the first call on hold and brings up a new call
screen, as shown in Figure 10-9, prompting you to place another call. You
can either dial the number using the number pad, or you can select a fre-
quently dialed number from your call log. (Again, this feature might not
be available on all networks.)
To place a call from your Address Book, press the trackwheel from the
New Call screen and choose Call from Address Book. Your BlackBerry
then prompts you to select a contact to dial to from the Address Book.
3. Place a call to the second participant by dialing a number, pressing
the trackwheel, and then choosing Call.
This is just like any other phone call (except that the first participant is
still on the other line).
4. While the second participant is on the phone with you, press the
trackwheel and choose Join from the contextual menu, as shown in
Figure 10-10.
Figure 10-10:

Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person

Doing so reconnects the first participant back with you, along with the
second participant. Now you can discuss away with both participants at
the same time (see Figure 10-11).
Another name for having two people on the phone with you is three-way call-
ing, which is not a new concept. If you want to chat with four people or even
ten people on the phone at the same time, you certainly can. Simply repeat
Steps 2–4 in the preceding list until you have all the participants on the
phone conference.
Talking privately to a conference 
participant
During a conference call, you might want to talk to one participant privately.
This is called splitting your conference call. Here’s how you do it:
1. While on a conference call, press the trackwheel, and choose Split
Call from the contextual menu.
This brings up a pop-up screen, listing all the participants of the confer-
ence call. (See Figure 10-12.)
2. From the pop-up screen, scroll to the participant with whom you want
to speak privately and then press the trackwheel.
This action places all other participants on hold and connects you to the
participant that you selected.
On the display screen, you can see whom you are connected to — for
confirmation that you selected the right person to privately chat with.
3. To talk to all participants again, press the trackwheel and choose Join
from the contextual menu.
Doing so brings you back to the conference call with everyone.

Alternate between phone conversations
Whether you’re in a private conversation during a conference call or you’re
talking to someone while you have someone else on hold, you can switch
between the two conversations by swapping them.
1. While talking to someone with another person on hold, press the
trackwheel and choose Swap from the contextual menu.
Doing so switches you from the person with whom you’re currently talk-
ing to the person who was on hold.
2. Repeat Step 1 to go back to original conversation.
Dropping that meeting hugger
If you’ve been on conference calls, you can identify those chatty “meeting
huggers” who have to say something about everything. Don’t you wish that
you could drop those meeting huggers off the call? Well, with your BlackBerry,
you can (as long as you are the meeting moderator or the person who initi-
ates the call).
1. While on a conference call, press the trackwheel and choose Drop
Call from the contextual menu.
This brings up a pop-up screen, listing all the participants of the confer-
ence call.
2. From the pop-up screen, scroll to the meeting hugger you want to
drop and press the trackwheel.
Doing so disconnects the meeting hugger.
3. Conversation can continue as usual.

Communicating Hands-Free
Because more and more places prohibit the use of mobile phones without a
hands-free headset, we thought we’d go through all the hands-free options
you have on your BlackBerry. Also, having your hands free (potentially)
makes you a more productive person, which would probably please your
boss more.
Using the speaker phone 
(7100 model only)
The Speaker Phone function is very useful under certain situations, such as
when you’re in a room full of people who want to join in on your phone con-
versation. Or, you might be all by your lonesome in your office but are stuck
rooting through your files — hard to do with a BlackBerry scrunched up
against your ear. (We call such moments multitasking — a concept so impor-
tant we devote an entire upcoming section to it.)
To switch to speaker phone while you’re on a phone call, press the Speaker
Phone button (on the 7100) or press the trackwheel and choose Activate
Speaker Phone from the contextual menu that appears.
Pairing your BlackBerry 
with a Bluetooth headset
Because your BlackBerry comes with a wired hands-free headset, you can
start using it by simply plugging in the headset into the headset jack on the
left-side of your BlackBerry. You adjust the volume of the headset by rolling
the trackwheel, the same as you would adjust the call volume without the
headset.
Using the wired hands-free headset can help you avoid being a police target,
but if you’re multitasking on your BlackBerry, the wired headset can get in
the way and become quite inconvenient.
This is where the whole Bluetooth wireless thing comes in. You can purchase a
BlackBerry Bluetooth headset to go with your Bluetooth-enabled BlackBerry.
For a list of BlackBerry-compatible Bluetooth headsets, see Chapter 16.
After you purchase a BlackBerry-compatible Bluetooth headset, you can pair
your BlackBerry with it. Think of pairing a Bluetooth headset with your
BlackBerry as registering the headset with your BlackBerry so that it recog-
nizes the headset.
246
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

First things first: You are going to need to prep your headset for pairing. Now,
each headset manufacturer has a different take on this, so you’ll need to con-
sult your headset documentation for more details. With that out of the way,
though, you’ll need to continue with the actual pairing. Here’s how that’s done:
1. Highlight the Options (Settings) application from the BlackBerry
Home screen and then press the trackwheel.
Doing so opens the Options (Settings) application.
2. Scroll through the list of options until you find the Bluetooth setting
and then press the trackwheel.
This opens the Bluetooth settings.
3. Press the trackwheel to bring up the Bluetooth menu.
You see the Enable Bluetooth option. If you see the Disable Bluetooth
option instead, you can skip to Step 5.
4. From the menu, scroll to Enable Bluetooth and press the trackwheel.
This enables Bluetooth on your BlackBerry.
5. Press the trackwheel to bring up the Bluetooth menu.
You see Add Device as an option.
6. From the menu, scroll to Add Device and press the trackwheel.
You see the Searching for Devices progress bar, um, progressing. See
Figure 10-13.
Figure 10-13:
Searching
for a
headset.
247
Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person

When your BlackBerry discovers the headset, a Select Device dialog box
shows up with the name of headset on the display screen. See Figure
10-14.
7. From the Select Device dialog box, press the trackwheel to select the
headset.
A dialog box appears to prompt you for a passkey code to the headset.
Normally, the passkey is 0000, but refer to your headset documentation
for the passkey.
8. Enter the passkey and press the trackwheel.
After you successfully enter the passkey, you see your headset listed in
the Bluetooth setting.
9. Press the trackwheel to bring up the Bluetooth menu.
You see the Connect option.
10. From the menu, scroll to Connect and press the trackwheel.
Your BlackBerry will now attempt to connect to the Bluetooth headset.
When you see a screen like Figure 10-15, you can start using your
Bluetooth headset.

Multitasking While on the Phone
One of the great things about the BlackBerry is that you can use your
BlackBerry for other tasks while you’re on the phone. For example, while on a
phone call, you can take notes or make a to-do list for after the call is finished.
Or you can look up a phone number in the BlackBerry Address Book that your
caller is asking you for. You can even compose an e-mail while on a call.
The catch here is that you can multitask only if you are using a hands-free
headset or speaker phone (7100 model only). Otherwise, your face would be
stuck to your BlackBerry, and you couldn’t engage in your conversation and
multitask at the same time.
Starting multitasking
After you have your hands-free headset on or speaker phone turned on, you
can start multitasking by doing the following:
Figure 10-15:

Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person

1. While in a conversation, from the Phone application, press the track-
wheel and choose Home Screen.
This returns you to the Home screen without terminating your phone
conversation.
With the 7100 model, you can simply press the ESC button while in the
Phone application to return to your Home screen.
2. From the Home screen, you can start multitasking.
Although you can compose e-mails during a phone conversation, you cannot
send the e-mail until you finish the phone conversation. In addition, you
cannot surf the Web while on the phone.
While on the phone and multitasking, however, you can still access the Phone
menu from other applications. For example, from your to-do list, you can end
a call (as shown in Figure 10-16) or put a call on the hold.
Taking notes while on the phone
To take notes of your call
1. While on a phone conversation, press the trackwheel and choose Notes.
This displays the Notes screen.
2. Type notes for the conversation, as shown in Figure 10-17.
Figure 10-16:
Ending 
a call.
250
Part III: Getting Online with Your BlackBerry 

3. When the call ends, press the trackwheel and choose Save to record
the notes you’ve taken.
Accessing phone notes
From the call history list (refer to Figure 10-3), you can access call notes that
you’ve made during a call or conference. In addition, you can also edit/add
new notes.
You can also dial straight from the phone history list by scrolling to the
number on the history list. See the section “Calling from the history list,” ear-
lier in this chapter, for more details.
As Figure 10-18 illustrates, you can also see a call log — a listing of how many
times you’ve called a particular number and how long the last conversation
lasted — for each entry in your history list.
Figure 10-18:

Chapter 10: Calling Your Favorite Person

To get the call log for a contact and add or view the corresponding notes for
a particular call, do the following
1. After opening the Phone application, scroll to a contact or number on
the phone history list and press the trackwheel.
The Phone menu appears.
2. Choose Open.
The call logs for the selected contact open. From here, you can add or
view notes for a particular conversation. (Note: Conversation notes are
indicated by a notepad icon.)
3. To add notes to a listing, scroll to a particular conversation, press the
trackwheel, and choose Add Notes.
This opens the Notes screen, where you can add conversation notes.
4. When done, press the trackwheel and choose Save to save your notes.
This returns you to the call log.
5. To access the notes from the call log, scroll to a conversation, press
the trackwheel, and choose Edit Notes.
Here you can both view and edit the notes you’ve taken.
Adding notes after the fact is great, but remember that you can also add con-
versation notes while on the phone. For all the details, see the “Taking notes
while on the phone” section, earlier in the chapter.

 Resolving data conflicts between your desktop computer and your BlackBerry
 Dealing with third-party application data
 Using manual and automatic synchronization
W
hat better way to keep your BlackBerry updated than to synchronize
it with your desktop application’s data? Arguably, most of the data
you need to synchronize is from your PIM (personal information manager)
applications. PIM info includes notes, appointments, addresses, and tasks.
The crucial piece for data synchronization to and from your device and desk-
top computer is the Intellisync software. Intellisync is a product of Puma
Technologies, licensed by RIM to work inside BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
This software allows you to synchronize your PIM data. But that’s not all; it
also lets you to synchronize your e-mail and all your other third-party appli-
cation data. As a giveaway, it can also update your BlackBerry’s date and
time to sync with your desktop machine’s date and time.
In this chapter, we introduce Intellisync. The chapter shows you how to man-
ually and automatically synchronize your BlackBerry with your desktop com-
puter. We also offer tips on which data synchronization options you might
want to use. Before we get into all that, however, we include a section on the
BlackBerry Desktop Manager.

Introduction to BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager
The centerpiece of desktop activities that you can do for your BlackBerry is
the BlackBerry Desktop Manager (BDM), which is a suite of programs that
include
 Application Loader: Program for installing BlackBerry applications and
updating the BlackBerry OS. Read Chapter 12 for details on how to use
this program.
 Backup and Restore: Allows you to back up your BlackBerry data and
settings. Check Chapter 14 for more details.
 Intellisync: Program that allows you to synchronize your BlackBerry
data to your PC (the topic of this chapter).
 Redirector Settings: Program for setting e-mail-related settings and fil-
ters. See Chapter 13 for more details.
BDM is the software included on the CD that comes with your handheld
device. Your BlackBerry’s packaging provides instructions on how to install
the BDM on your desktop computer. For corporate users, check with your
BlackBerry system administrator for more details.
Launching BDM
In most Windows installations, you find the shortcut to launch BDM through
the Start menu of your computer; choose Start➪All Programs➪BlackBerry➪
Desktop Manager. Connect your BlackBerry to your desktop computer using
the USB cable that came with your device and launch BDM. The BDM opening
screen appears (see Figure 11-1).
Notice the number of icons on this screen. Each of these icons is an applica-
tion by itself. Because it is a separate application, the installation of your
Figure 11-1:
The
BlackBerry
Desktop
Manager.
256
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

BDM might vary from phone provider to provider. At the very least, you
should have at least three icons or three applications: Application Loader
(see Chapter 12), Backup and Restore (Chapter 14), and Intellisync. Most
phone providers don’t include the Redirector Settings unless your
BlackBerry is connected to BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES). Redirector
Settings work for only those devices that run under BES.
Connecting BDM to your BlackBerry
You establish a connection between your BlackBerry and the BDM through
the USB cable that comes with your device. Plug in your device to your desk-
top. After BDM is running, it will try to find a BlackBerry on the type of con-
nection specified. The default connection is USB, so it should work without
your needing to configure anything.
If your device has a password, BDM prompts for the password. Enter the
password, and then you should see Connected as the heading of the screen.
If for some reason you see Disconnected and no password prompt, either
BDM can’t find the device being connected via USB, or the connection setting
is not set to use USB.
To make sure that the connection setting uses USB, go to Options➪
Connection Settings of the BDM screen menu. The BDM menu is located at
the top of the screen, and Options is the third from the left. A pop-up screen
appears (see Figure 11-2). From this screen, you can select the USB connec-
tion having the PIN of your BlackBerry from the Connection drop-down as
shown here.
Running BDM for the first time
If you’re running BDM for the first time, the process can take a while. BDM
tries to make the initial configuration on your machine, including finding the
default e-mail client and the e-mail account that it will assign for the Intellisync
software. It asks you to confirm the e-mail account during this time. If you
have multiple e-mail accounts set up on your desktop computer, be sure to
select the one you want your BlackBerry to use.
Figure 11-2:

connection
types 
to your
BlackBerry.
257
Chapter 11: Synching the Intellisync Way

The BDM also checks what applications you have on your device and what
required applications need to be installed. If it cannot find a required applica-
tion on your device, it prompts you to install it. Of course, you have the
option to cancel and install later.
After the checking for applications, BDM looks at the settings you have for your
Intellisync software. If you have settings in auto-start, as discussed later in this
chapter, BDM attempts to run synchronization for each one you selected.
Setting Up Intellisync
Intellisync is software that allows you to synchronize your data between your
desktop computer and your BlackBerry. For those of you who have devices
with the latest OS and running on BES 4.0, you don’t need Intellisync because
you can do synchronization wirelessly. Many folks don’t have the BES 4.0 con-
figuration, however.
Intellisync is the third icon on the BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen. To
launch Intellisync, simply double-click the icon. A screen like the one shown
in Figure 11-3 appears.
The Intellisync screen is divided into two frames. The top one allows you to
manually trigger synchronization, and the bottom frame is where you can set
up the configuration and rules for reconciling data. The first thing you need
to figure out is the configuration (bottom) section.
Figure 11-3:
The
Intellisync
screen.
258
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

Configuring e-mail reconciliation
Looking at the Configuration section of the Intellisync screen in Figure 11-3,
e-mail is the first option. Clicking the Configure Email button displays the
screen shown in Figure 11-4. This screen has three sections; the top one
allows you to choose the direction of the update as well as the rules of the
reconciliation.
Here are the options you can choose:
 Import Moves and Deletes to Handheld Only: Whatever you do on the
handheld will not affect the mailbox side.
 Synchronize Moves and Deletes: The desktop and the handheld will be
in sync.
Suppose that you delete a message in your BlackBerry and then the same e-mail
that you edited in your desktop mail client. In a conflicting scenario (e-mail is
updated on both sides), you need to tell Intellisync which side dominates:
 Mailbox Wins: Changes done on the mailbox (through a desktop mail
client, like Outlook) take effect, and changes done on the handheld are
disregarded.
 Handheld Wins: Changes done on the handheld take effect, and changes
done through the desktop mail client are disregarded.
By default, synchronization is done for your inbox folder. If you have per-
sonal folders, the bottom portion of the screen shown in Figure 11-4 allows
you to select personal folders on synchronization.
Figure 11-4:
The Email
Configuration
screen.
259
Chapter 11: Synching the Intellisync Way

Configuring PIM synchronization
The next item in the Configuration section of Figure 11-3 is the PIM (personal
information manager). PIM info includes notes, appointments, addresses, 
and tasks. Clicking the Configure PIM button displays the screen shown in
Figure 11-5.
This screen is the entry point of the entire synchronization configuration for
applications that are part of PIM. As you can see in this screen, the PIM hand-
held application is paired with a desktop application. This figure shows
Outlook as the desktop application.
Figure 11-5:
The PIM
Configuration
screen.
260
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
BES 4.0 and wireless synchronization
Note that if your BlackBerry is running in BES
4.0, the Configuration portion of the screen for
e-mail is disabled and defaults to the Import
Moves and Deletes to Handheld Only option. In
BES 4.0, wireless synchronization is possible,
and the likelihood of conflicts is very rare
because whatever you do for either side gets
reconciled very quickly over the air.
The wireless e-mail reconciliation section of the
screen shown in Figure 11-4 is informational. It
tells you whether your BES supports wireless
e-mail synchronization. When BES supports
wireless synchronization, this portion of the
screen tells you whether you enabled it on your
device and also gives you directions where on
the handheld you can configure it. Remember
that when your wireless synchronization is
available, you don’t need Intellisync. All the
functions that Intellisync does can be done
wirelessly and can be set up using your device.

If you’re curious as to what other application the PIM Configuration option
supports, click the Choose button to see a screen similar to Figure 11-6, which
lists other possible applications. The list depends on the context of the high-
lighted PIM application. These other desktop applications are also popular;
you’re likely currently using one of these. Isn’t it nice to know that you don’t
have to dump the application you’re already familiar with?
Updating your BlackBerry’s date and time
Date and time are naturals for Intellisync because appointments are time
dependent. The likelihood that your desktop machine has a more accurate
time than your device is high. Say your BlackBerry is five minutes behind. If
you set your appointment reminder to five minutes, your meeting is about to
start before your BlackBerry gives you a notification. In all likelihood, you
want your BlackBerry’s date and time to be the same — and accurate. Refer
to the Intellisync screen of Figure 11-3 earlier this chapter to see the four
check boxes of the top Synchronize Now area. All you need to do is select the
fourth one — Update Handheld’s Date and Time — to update your handheld.
Mapping fields for synchronization
For all four PIM applications, Intellisync knows what fields from the desktop
applications map to your device application fields. But not all fields found on
the desktop side exist on the handheld (and vice versa). For example, in the
BlackBerry Address Book application, a Nick Name field doesn’t exist but is
available on Exchange (Outlook) Address Book. In some instances, Intellisync
provides you with an alternate field and gives you a choice to map or not. So,
Figure 11-6:
Other
desktop
apps that
Intellisync
supports for
Address
Book sync.
261
Chapter 11: Synching the Intellisync Way

if you ever find the need to change the default mapping, you have the facility
to do so. The interface is the same for all PIM applications. To illustrate how
to map and un-map fields, we use the Address Book.
The following steps lead you to the screen that allows you to map the fields
for Address Book:
1. From BDM, double-click Intellisync and then click the Configure PIM
button from the Configuration screen that follows.
The PIM configuration screen appears (refer to Figure 11-5). Notice the
Configure drop-down button on the lower-right corner.
2. Click the Configure button and then choose Advanced Settings from
the drop-down list that follows.
The Advanced Settings for Address Book screen appears, as shown in
Figure 11-7. The Field Mapping button is located on this screen. Note
that you use similar steps to get to the Field Mapping screens on other
PIM applications.
3. Click the Field Mapping button.
If you’re not careful, you can inadvertently unclick Job Title mapping on
the next screen, and suddenly titles are no longer in-sync. Intellisync rec-
ognizes this risk and gives you a warning screen, as shown in Figure 11-8.
If you think you made a mistake, you can cancel from this point to save
yourself from having to do a lot of extra work to restore settings.
Figure 11-7:
The
Advanced
Settings for
Address
Book

262
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

4. To proceed, click OK.
The Field Mapping screen for the Address Book application appears (see
Figure 11-9). To map or un-map, click the arrows.
5. Click OK to save your changes.
Confirming record changes
Face facts: Doing a desktop synchronization is not a very interesting task, and
not many people perform it on a regular basis. If you’re one of those folks, you
won’t have any clue what changes to expect on either side. Well, not to worry.
You can tell Intellisync to prompt you for any changes it’s trying to do or perhaps
undo on either side of the wire. This is where the Confirmation tab of the
Advanced Settings screen comes in. To get to this view, follow these steps:

263
Chapter 11: Synching the Intellisync Way

1. From BDM, double-click Intellisync; from the Configuration screen
that appears, click the Configure PIM button.
The PIM configuration screen appears (refer to Figure 11-5). Notice the
Configure button in the lower-right corner. At this point, Address Book is
highlighted. So, the next step is based on the Address Book application.
If you want to go to the Confirmation tab of a PIM application other than
Address Book, you have to click that application from the list at this point.
2. Click the Configure button and then choose Advanced Settings from
the drop-down list that follows.
The Advanced Settings for Address Book screen appears (refer to 
Figure 11-7). Note the Confirmation tab from this screen.
3. If not active, click the Confirmation tab.
The Confirmation tab comes into view (refer to Figure 11-7).
This screen gives you two options:
• Display a prompt screen to confirm deletions.
• Display a prompt screen to confirm updates and additions.
Regardless of whether you select the first option, Intellisync displays a
prompt to confirm the deletion of all records.
Resolving update conflicts
If you don’t synchronize your device frequently, you will get into a situation
where you must make an update to a particular record on your BlackBerry as
well as on your desktop application. Intellisync needs to know how you want
this handled. The interface to define how to resolve these conflicts is the
same for all PIM applications. Again, for illustration purposes, we use the
Address Book as an example.
1. From BDM, double-click Intellisync; from the Configuration screen
that appears, click the Configure PIM button.
The PIM configuration screen shows up (refer to Figure 11-5). Notice the
Configure button in the lower-right corner.
2. Click the Configure button; from the drop-down list that appears,
choose Advanced Settings.
The Advanced Settings for Address Book screen appears (refer to Figure
11-7). Note that this screen has three tabs, and the second tab is titled
Conflict Resolution.
3. Click the Conflict Resolution tab.
The Conflict Resolution tab comes into view, as shown in Figure 11-10.
264
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

You can tell Intellisync to handle conflicts in a few different ways. Here
are the options shown in the Address Book Advanced Settings screen:
• Add All Conflicting Items: Tells Intellisync that when a conflict
happens, a new record should be added to the BlackBerry for the
changes done on the desktop, and a new record should be added
to the desktop side for the changes done on the BlackBerry.
• Ignore All Conflicting Items: Just ignores the fact that there has
been a change on the record and keeps the data the same on both
sides.
• Notify Me When Conflicts Occur: This is the safest among the
options. Intellisync displays a message screen with the details of
the record that has a conflict and gives you the ability to resolve
the conflict.
• Handheld Wins: Unless you are sure that this is the case, you
shouldn’t choose this option. It basically tells Intellisync to disre-
gard the changes done in the desktop application and use hand-
held changes every time it encounters a conflict.
• MS Outlook Wins: If you’re not using MS Outlook, this option is
worded based on the application you’re using. This option is oppo-
site to the Handheld Wins option in that it tells Intellisync to
always discard changes on the handheld and use the desktop
application change whenever it encounters a conflict. Again, we
don’t recommend this option because there’s no telling on which
side you made the good update.
4. Click the options you want and then click OK to save the settings.
Setting Up Synchronization Filters
Have you seen your task list from seven years ago? Looks embarrassing,
right? Here’s one common mistakes most people do synchronizing their
Figure 11-10:

265
Chapter 11: Synching the Intellisync Way

brand new BlackBerry — they load everything on the device. Do you really
want to see your old appointments and tasks you had so many years ago
available on your BlackBerry? Of course not. Maybe the past three months of
appointments is enough or perhaps a year-to-date’s worth of tasks is appro-
priate. Well, you’re the only one who can tell what you really need. So, before
you get too excited and click that Synchronize Now button on your new
BlackBerry, spend a little bit of time creating filters so that only the data you
deem useful gets into your device.
Creating filters
Creating filters on synchronization uses the same interface for all PIM appli-
cation data. For illustration purposes, we use the MemoPad. Say you want
only those notes starting from August 24, 2005. Use the following steps to
create such a filter on your MemoPad items:
1. From BDM, double-click Intellisync; from the Configuration screen
that appears, click the Configure PIM button.
The PIM configuration screen appears (refer to Figure 11-5). To make
MemoPad the context for any changes you need to do in this screen,
highlight it.
2. Choose MemoPad from the list. Then click the Configure button.
3. From the drop-down list that appears, choose Advanced Settings.
The Advanced Settings for MemoPad screen shows up. The screen is the
same as the one shown in Figure 11-7; the only difference is the title bar
indicates that it’s for MemoPad. Again, note that this screen has three
tabs; the third tab is titled Filters.
4. Click the Filters tab.
The Filters tab comes into view, as shown in Figure 11-11.
Figure 11-11:
The Filters
tab of the
Advanced
Settings
screen.
266
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

5. Click New and enter the name of the filter in the pop-up screen that
appears.
A new filter screen appears (see the upcoming Figure 11-12). There are
two tabs on this screen.
• The Conditions tab allows you to define one or more conditions for
this filter.
• The Rules tab allows you to specify whether all conditions should
be met in order for this filter to act or if one of the conditions is
enough.
For this example, we want Intellisync to transfer MemoPad notes whose
creation date is on or after August 24, 2005. To define this condition, the
Field drop-down button allows you to specify Creation Date field, and
the Operator drop-down list allows you to specify on or after the date
you specify in the empty text box (under the Value button).
6. Click the Field button and then choose Creation Date from the drop-
down list. Click the Operator button and Choose On Or After from the
drop-down list. Then enter 8/24/2005 in the text box.
After completing Step 6, all the values of the screen should be the same
as shown in Figure 11-12. Note that this condition is not yet added. The
Add to List button will add this condition in the list frame. If you have an
existing condition, the Remove and Update buttons let you delete or
modify it.
7. Click the Add to List button.
Your condition is now added to the List of Filter Conditions below. You
can define many conditions and combine them to define a filter. But in
this case, only one condition is necessary.
Figure 11-12:
A complete
filter
condition
ready to be
added.
267
Chapter 11: Synching the Intellisync Way

8. Click the Rules tab.
The Rules tab comes into view, as shown in Figure 11-13.
Because we have only one condition in this example, we don’t have to do
anything on this tab. It comes into play only when you have multiple con-
ditions. There are cases when you will be faced with such a situation.
When this happens, you need to decide whether all the conditions need
to be satisfied to make the filter active or whether any one of the condi-
tions is enough. For example, suppose you want to transfer tasks that
you entered three months ago as well as all other tasks — as long as their
status is not yet completed. In this case, you can create two filters; then,
on this tab, select the second option (One or More Options Must Be Met).
9. Click OK to save the filter.
Creating special filters for 
Calendar synchronization
Because of the nature of appointments, you might want to restrict transfer of
records for those that are in the span near the time when they are most
important. This filter is a special one that you don’t define via the Filter tab.
To go to the view where you can set it up, follow these steps:
1. From BDM, double-click Intellisync. From the Configuration screen
that appears, click the Configure PIM button.
The PIM configuration screen appears (refer to Figure 11-5).
2. Choose Calendar from the list. Click the Configure drop-down button;
from the drop-down list that appears, choose Advanced Settings.
Figure 11-13:
The Rules
tab of a
MemoPad
sync filter.
268
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

The Advanced Settings for Calendar screen shows up, as shown in
Figure 11-14. Note the difference between this screen and the one for
Address Book (shown in Figure 11-7). This screen has a Date Range tab,
which happens to be the first tab. You can select from the three options:
• Transfer All Scheduled Items: This transfers everything: past and
future appointments.
• Transfer Only Future Items: This is the default and transfers only
future appointments.
• Transfer Items within a Range of Days: This option allows you to
set the number of days prior and after today. The best thing about
this option is that today adjusts to the current date.
3. Specify the options you want and then click OK to save the 
configuration.
Creating special filters for 
Tasks synchronization
One unique force in the Tasks application is represented by the status field. It
would be a natural choice to not transfer items marked as completed. You
can set up a filter for this, but Intellisync has a quick interface for you to do it
outside of the Filter tab. To get to this view, follow these steps:
1. From BDM, double-click Intellisync; from the Configuration screen
that appears, click the Configure PIM button.
The PIM configuration screen appears (refer to Figure 11-5).

269
Chapter 11: Synching the Intellisync Way

2. Choose Tasks from the list. Click the Configure button; from the drop-
down list that appears, choose Advanced Settings.
The Advanced Settings for Tasks screen appears, as shown in Figure 11-15.
Note the difference between this screen and the one for Address Book
(refer to Figure 11-7). This screen has a Tasks tab, which happens to be
the first tab. You can select from the two options:
• Transfer All Items: This transfers everything.
• Transfer Only Pending Items: Completed items will not be 
transferred.
3. Specify the options you want and then click OK to save the 
configuration.
Configuring Synchronization 
for Third-Party Software
The BlackBerry platform is extensible: that is, it can be made to function
beyond the capabilities of the programs it’s preloaded with and to extend
access to your personal or corporate data. Software companies can develop
applications for your device — and just like the PIM applications, these appli-
cations can also use Intellisync to transfer data to and from the BlackBerry
handheld. If you have such a third-party application, you can configure or run
data synchronization from the Intellisync interface.
To illustrate how this works, imagine that you have blogger software installed
on your device. This software allows you to write your blogs and also post to
Figure 11-15:
The
Advanced
Settings for
Tasks
screen.
270
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

your blog site wirelessly. It also has a desktop version that functions the
same way — only, it posts to your Web site via a desktop Internet connection.
The software has a neat feature of allowing you to sync your draft blogs
between your desktop and BlackBerry so that you can continue writing them
at your convenience. Again, this is a hypothetical case, just for you to see
how it all fits together.
The steps involved in configuring this third-party application to sync are as
follows:
1. From BDM, double-click Intellisync; from the Configuration screen
that appears, click Configure Add-ins.
The Add-in Module Configuration screen appears, as shown in Figure 11-16.
For a third-party application to hook into Intellisync, it has to create an
Add-in Module. This Add-in Module is responsible for writing and read-
ing data from the device. It has to be registered to Intellisync so that
Intellisync can run the process during synchronization.
You can see from this screen all the Add-in Modules that are registered to
Intellisync. Each Add-in might or might not have any user configuration
settings, but if it does, this is the screen where you will set them. For this
hypothetical case, say it has configuration settings that you can control.
2. Click the Add-in name and then click the Configure button.
The third-party application configuration screen shows up (in this case,
as shown in Figure 11-17).
This screen can be anything, but for our hypothetical blogger app, it
allows you to configure the location of your blog files. Also, it gives you
the option to resolve possible conflicts.

3. Enter or set the options and then click OK to save the configuration.
Ready, Set, Synchronize!
Are you ready to synchronize? Earlier in this chapter, we show you how to
define synchronization filters and rules for your e-mail and PIM data. Now it’s
time to be brave and push the button. Your two choices are manually (by
using the Synchronize Now button) or automatically.
Synchronize Now
Synchronize Now is a feature of Intellisync that enables you to run the syn-
chronization manually. The basic rundown is that you choose the data you
want to synchronize, you click the Synchronize Now button, and that’s it.
Without delay, here are the steps:
1. From BDM, double-click Intellisync.
The Intellisync screen appears; refer to Figure 11-3. The four check
boxes in the Synchronize Now frame in the Intellisync screen give you
the option to selectively synchronize your data. You can choose from
e-mail, PIM, add-in, and date and time.
2. Mark the check boxes of the data that you want to synchronize and
then click Synchronize Now button.
Intellisync starts running the synchronization; you see a progress
screen. If you set up rules to prompt you for conflicts and if Intellisync
encounters one, you see a screen to resolve it.
After synchronization is done, the progress screen disappears, and
Intellisync screen comes back into focus.
3. Close Intellisync by clicking the Close button.

Automatic synchronization
How many times do you think you reconfigure your Intellisync setup? Rarely,
right? After you have it configured, that’s it. Yes, maybe once in a while you’ll
find a reason to change something, but it’s mostly static. And if you’re like us,
the reason you open BlackBerry Desktop Manager is because you want to run
Intellisync. So, opening Intellisync and clicking the Synchronize Now button
is somewhat annoying. In this case, if you’d like to make Intellisync automati-
cally run every time you connect your BlackBerry and open BDM, the follow-
ing steps are for you:
1. From BDM, double-click Intellisync; from the Configuration screen
that appears, click the Auto Start button.
The Auto Start Settings screen appears, as shown in Figure 11-18. Note
that these are the same choices you have in the Synchronize Now frame
of the main screen (refer to Figure 11-3) of Intellisync. The purpose of
this screen is for you to select which among the four choices you want
included to run automatically whenever BDM is launched and connected
to your BlackBerry. No more double-clicking Intellisync and no more
clicking the Synchronize Now button.
2. Select from the options provided by the check boxes and then click
OK to save your changes.
At this point, you are set up to automatically synchronize for the options
you selected every time your BlackBerry is connected and BDM is
launched.
At some point when (and for whatever reason) you want to stop the auto-
matic synchronization of your data, just follow the same preceding steps.
However, in Step 2, clear the option corresponding to the data for which you
want to cease automatic synchronization.

Installing Applications
In This Chapter
 Getting started with Application Loader
 Installing a BlackBerry application
 Uninstalling an application
 Upgrading your operating system
T
oward the end of this book, we point out to you a few great applications
that make your BlackBerry that much more productive as well as a
couple of games that make your BlackBerry more entertaining than ever. Rest
assured, though, that installing an application on your BlackBerry is a snap.
Think of your BlackBerry as a mini-laptop where you can run pre-installed
applications (as well as install new applications). You can even upgrade your
BlackBerry’s OS. (Yup, that’s right, your BlackBerry even has an operating
system, similar to how a PC runs on a Microsoft Window XP operating system.)
We start this chapter by introducing the Application Loader, which allows you
to load applications onto your BlackBerry — hence its name. Then we show
you how to both install and uninstall an application from your BlackBerry.
Finally, we will show you how to upgrade your OS by using the Application
Loader.
If your BlackBerry is company owned, your company might impose guide-
lines on what applications (if any) can and cannot be installed and unin-
stalled from your device. Be sure to familiarize yourself with your IT
department’s policy before attempting to install or uninstall software from
your company-owned BlackBerry.
Accessing Application Loader
In this chapter, as with other chapters in Part IV of this book, you work
closely with your PC in conjunction with your BlackBerry. On your PC, you
use an application called BlackBerry Desktop Manager (BDM), which comes

on a CD along with your BlackBerry. For introduction to the BlackBerry
Desktop Manager, see Chapter 11. Application Loader is a mini-application
within the BlackBerry Desktop Manager. The Application Loader allows you
to install and uninstall applications as well as upgrade your BlackBerry OS.
After BlackBerry Desktop Manager is installed on your PC, connect your
BlackBerry to your PC via the USB cable that comes with your BlackBerry to
join your BlackBerry to your PC. If everything is set up properly, you see a
pop-up window on your PC prompting you to enter your BlackBerry security
password. After you enter your correct password, your BlackBerry is con-
nected to your PC.
In order to access the Application Loader
1. On your PC, choose Start➪Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
This opens the BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
2. Connect your BlackBerry to your PC via your USB cable.
Doing so connects your BlackBerry to your PC. If successful, you will see
the password dialog box (see Figure 12-1). If not, check to see whether
the USB cable is connected properly to both your PC and your
BlackBerry and then try again. If all else fails, contact your service
provider; see Chapter 2 for contact numbers. Or, contact your system
administrator if you are an enterprise user.
3. Enter your password.
This completes your BlackBerry-PC connection.
4. On your PC, double-click the Application Loader icon within the
BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
The Application Loader Wizard welcome screen opens (see Figure 12-2).
At this point, you are ready to use the functions of the Application Loader.
Figure 12-1:

dialog box
on your PC.
276
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

Installing an Application
In order to install an application onto your BlackBerry from your PC via the
Application Loader, you first have to install that application on your PC. The
initial install onto your PC typically varies, depending on which application
you choose to install, so be sure to refer to the manual that comes with the
application you choose.
After you get the BlackBerry application onto your PC, you need to locate the
application’s ALX file (a file with the extension .alx). The ALX file isn’t the
file that gets installed on your BlackBerry; rather, it tells the Application
Loader where the actual application file is located on your PC. Think of it as a
direction for Application Loader to find the application file. You can usually
find a BlackBerry application’s ALX file in the PC folder where you installed
the application on your PC. Refer to the manual that comes with the
BlackBerry application for more info.
In this chapter, we use an application called BlackBerry Blogger as a sample
application to install on your BlackBerry. You can download this application
from www.BlackBerryGoodies.com/BBblogger, but you can use an appli-
cation of your choice to install.
After you install the BlackBerry application (in our case, BlackBerry Blogger) on
your PC, you can install it on your BlackBerry by using the Application Loader:
1. Launch Application Loader from the BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
The Application Loader Wizard welcome screen appears. (Refer to
Figure 12-2.)
Figure 12-2:
The
Application

screen.
277
Chapter 12: Installing Applications

2. From the Application Loader Wizard welcome screen, click the Next
button.
This takes you to a screen where you have to enter your password once
more, as shown in the top screen of Figure 12-3. This is for added secu-
rity. Click Next.
If, for some reason, your handheld isn’t connected properly, you see the
Communication Port Selection screen, as shown in the bottom screen of
Figure 12-3. To remedy this, try to connect your BlackBerry to the USB
cable and make sure that the USB cable is connected to the PC. Then
click Next.
Figure 12-3:

278
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

3. After entering your password, you see the Handheld Application
Selection screen, as shown in Figure 12-4.
This screen lists the applications that are already installed on your
BlackBerry. (Your applications might not be exactly the same as those
listed in Figure 12-4.)
4. Click the Add button.
This opens an Open file window, where you need to locate the ALX file of
the application you need to install. (See Figure 12-5.)
5. Locate the ALX file and then click Open.
This returns you to the Handheld Application Selection window, where
you can see BlackBerry Blogger as one of the applications in the list.

279
Chapter 12: Installing Applications

6. Click Next.
Doing so brings up the confirmation screen, listing the application to be
installed.
7. Click Finish.
The installation process starts, and a progress window appears. When
progress window disappears — and if all went well — the application
should be on your BlackBerry.
Encountering an invalid signature error
If you encounter an invalid signature error when installing an application (see
Figure 12-6) and your BlackBerry was given to you by your employer, you do
not have permission to install application on your BlackBerry. Permissions
on your BlackBerry are controlled by IT policy.
Using alternatives to Application Loader
Although this chapter covers installing an application by using the
Application Loader or a wired install, another way to install application is
using a wireless install via an OTA (Over the Air) download. See Chapter 9 for
more on wireless installation.
Another way for an application to be installed on your BlackBerry is through
a BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) 4.0 wireless install. In the case of a BES
4.0 wireless installation, you have no control over the installation process.
This is more for your company’s BlackBerry system administrator to control
what applications are and are not on your BlackBerry.

Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

Uninstalling an Application
You can uninstall an application in two ways: by using the Application Loader
or by using your BlackBerry handheld.
As in the preceding section on installing, we use BlackBerry Blogger as an
example and assume that you already installed the BlackBerry Blogger appli-
cation. Of course, you can follow the same steps for uninstalling other appli-
cations of your choice.
Uninstalling using the Application Loader
The steps to uninstalling a BlackBerry application are similar to the steps for
installing:
1. Launch Application Loader and then click Next.
This takes you to a screen where you have to enter your password.
(Refer to the top screen of Figure 12-3.) This is for added security.
If, for some reason, your handheld isn’t connected properly, you see the
Communication Port Selection screen. (Refer to the bottom screen of
Figure 12-3.) Try to connect your BlackBerry to the USB cable and also
make sure that the USB cable is connected to the PC.
2. After entering your password, you see the Handheld Application
Selection screen. (Refer to Figure 12-4.)
This screen lists the applications that are already installed on your
BlackBerry. (Your applications listed might not be exactly the same as
those in Figure 12-4.)
3. From the Handheld Application Selection screen, scroll to the applica-
tion you wish to delete (BlackBerry Blogger, in this example) in the
list of applications and clear its check box.
Notice that the Action column for BlackBerry Blogger is Remove, as
shown in Figure 12-7.
4. Click Next.
A confirmation screen appears, confirming that Application Loader will
uninstall what you select (here, BlackBerry Blogger).
5. Click Finish.
The uninstall process starts, and a progress window appears. When the
progress window disappears, you have now uninstalled the unwanted
application from your BlackBerry.
281
Chapter 12: Installing Applications

Uninstalling using your 
BlackBerry handheld
When you’re on the run and don’t have access to your PC, you can still unin-
stall an application from your BlackBerry handheld.
Follow these steps to uninstall BlackBerry Blogger (or an application of your
choice) from your BlackBerry handheld:
1. Highlight the Options (Settings) application from the BlackBerry
Home screen and press the trackwheel.
Doing so opens the Options (Settings) application.
2. Scroll through the list of options until you find the Applications set-
ting and then press the trackwheel.
You see a list of applications installed on your BlackBerry.
3. Press the trackwheel to bring up the menu, scroll to Modules, and
then press the trackwheel again as shown in Figure 12-8.
You see a list of modules. Think of modules as files on your PC.
Figure 12-7:
Deselect a

282
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

4. Scroll to the module you wish to delete (blackberryblogger, in this
example) and press the trackwheel to bring up the menu. Scroll to
Delete and press the trackwheel again.
This brings up a confirmation dialog box, as shown in Figure 12-9.
5. From the confirmation dialog box, scroll to Delete and press the track-
wheel to confirm deletion.
Depending on the BlackBerry model you have, your BlackBerry might
restart as soon as you confirm the deletion.
Some BlackBerry models give you a choice to restart now or at a 
later time.
After restarting, the deleted application is uninstalled.

Chapter 12: Installing Applications

Upgrading Your BlackBerry OS
The latest BlackBerry OS update comes from software called BlackBerry
Handheld Software, which is available from your network service provider or
your BlackBerry system administrator.
In this section, we assume that you already have the latest BlackBerry
Handheld Software for your BlackBerry model installed on your local PC. For
help on installing BlackBerry Handheld Software, refer to the instructions
that come with BlackBerry Handheld Software.
Although this section is about upgrading your BlackBerry OS, we want to first
let you know that you should upgrade your BlackBerry OS only when you
have to or are told to by your network service provider or your corporate
BlackBerry system administrator. We (slightly) discourage you from upgrad-
ing your BlackBerry OS because we believe that when it comes to BlackBerry
OS, why ruin a good thing while you have it? Only when the good thing turns
bad or a better thing comes along should you attempt to upgrade your OS.
Don’t get us wrong: The folks at RIM have made upgrading your OS as simple
as it can be. But like upgrading OS on any other computing device (including
your PC), the risk of losing data is always there — as well as the risk that
things that don’t work as well as before.
To address the risk of information loss, the folks at RIM designed the
Application Loader to automatically backup for you as part of the OS
upgrade. However, our experience has taught us to perform a manual full
backup as an extra precaution. There have been times where the backup by
Application Loader didn’t achieve a full backup; see Chapter 14 for more on
backing up data manually.
Now that we’re finished with our disclaimer, it’s upgrade time!
After you finish a manual back up of your BlackBerry, you can start the
upgrade process by doing the following:
1. After entering your BlackBerry password into the BlackBerry Desktop
Manager on your PC, you see the Application Updates Available
screen, prompting you to update. (See Figure 12-10.)
In the Application Updates Available screen, you can opt-out of the OS
upgrade by clicking Cancel.
This screen shows up if you need an update — it means that your
BlackBerry OS is out of date. If this screen doesn’t appear, you don’t
need to continue with the rest of these steps.
284
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

2. From the Application Update Available screen, click the Update Now
button.
Doing so opens the Application Loader Wizard welcome screen (refer to
Figure 12-2).
3. From the Application Loader Wizard welcome screen, click Next.
This takes you to a screen where you have to enter your password.
(Refer to the top screen of Figure 12-3.) This is for added security.
If, for some reason, your handheld isn’t connected properly, you see the
Communication Port Selection screen, as shown earlier in the bottom
screen of Figure 12-3. Try to connect your BlackBerry to the USB cable
and make sure that the USB cable is also connected to the PC.
4. After entering your password, you see the Handheld Application
Selection screen.
The difference between this screen and the one shown in Figure 12-4 is
that the most of the applications listed have Update as their action in
the Action column.
5. Click Next.
This brings up the Application Data Backup screen, as shown in Figure
12-11, where you decide whether you want to backup your BlackBerry
content before upgrading your OS.
We recommend that you do select the automatically backup option even
if you already manually backed up your BlackBerry information.
6. From the Application Data Backup screen, select the top radio button
to run an automatic backup; also, select the lone check box to include
messages in the backup. Then click Next.
This brings up a summary page to confirm your actions. See Figure 12-12.
Figure 12-10:
The
Application
Updates

screen.
285
Chapter 12: Installing Applications

7. Click the Finish button.
The BlackBerry OS upgrade starts, complete with a progress window
with a series of steps and a progress bar. The whole process takes about
20 minutes or more, depending on your BlackBerry model and the OS
version you are upgrading to.
At times during the BlackBerry OS upgrade, your BlackBerry display
screen will be on and off. Do not worry; this is normal.
When the progress window disappears, the OS upgrade is complete.
Perform a full manual backup yourself before attempting to upgrade your
BlackBerry OS.

pam, spam, and more spam. Everyone gets spam everyday — you know,
those unsolicited e-mails that we all hate. Yes, everybody hates spam
except for those who benefit from this nasty endeavor. We can curse these
people to our hearts’ content, but spamming is not going to go away (at least
not on the immediate horizon). We hate spam because it’s not only a waste of
time, but it also fills up our inbox. Have you ever deleted a legit, important
e-mail while ridding your mailbox of spam? You’re not alone; these things can
lead to disaster.
Before going any further, this chapter is intended for those of you who have
corporate BlackBerry devices or those who have BlackBerry running on the
BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES). For those who have personal BlackBerry
handhelds running on BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS), you can skip this
chapter because it won’t apply to you. Similar functionality is available
through the BIS Web site provided by your phone provider.
Our goal here is to provide simple solutions to better manage your e-mail,
specifically those e-mail messages that you receive on your BlackBerry. With
the help of BlackBerry Desktop Manager (BDM), we cover ways to limit spam
reaching your device by using simple redirection rules, or filters. We also
show you how to customize your e-mail signature (or perhaps get rid of it).
You can also read how to set up rules and customize what constitutes a

Level1 Message. Finally, before the chapter ends, we show you how to limit
spam by limiting delivery of e-mail based on mailbox folders. Only e-mail
from selected mailbox folders that you define can reach your device.
Redirector Settings: Your Friendly 
E-Mail Traffic Police
Redirector Settings is a feature of the BlackBerry Desktop Manager. It high-
lights many functions specific to e-mail, the primary function being the place
of control where you can customize what e-mail goes into your BlackBerry
and how your device reacts to such e-mail.
Launch Redirector Settings from within the BlackBerry Desktop Manager
(BDM). If you have the BDM installed on your personal computer, go ahead
and launch it. In most cases, you should be able to navigate to BDM via the
Start menu of your computer running Windows; choose Start➪All Programs➪
BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager. If you don’t have it installed on your computer,
please refer to the instructions that come with your device for how to install it.
After BDM is running, Redirector Settings is the rightmost icon on the BDM
screen. The icon is an image of an antenna, as shown in Figure 13-1. Just
double-click its icon to launch Redirector Settings, which gives you a screen
similar to the one shown in Figure 13-2. Note that it has four tabs; the first
one is General.
Figure 13-1:
Open
Redirector

288
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

Red and green lights for 
incoming messages
In the General tab shown in Figure 13-2, notice the Redirection section (after
the PIN section). You could actually totally turn off receiving e-mail on your
BlackBerry by marking the first check box (Redirect Incoming Messages to
Your Handheld). Somehow we can’t find a good reason why you’d want to
choose this, but hey — the capability is definitely here in case you don’t want
to be bothered by any e-mail at all. However, if you want your BlackBerry to
function normally, just leave this check box selected.
The next check box is almost the same as the first one but applies only when
your handheld is cradled or attached to your desktop machine. The default
setting is to not redirect incoming messages; the assumption is that you’re
using your desktop e-mail client and not your BlackBerry.

Filtering e-mail
One big advantage of having a BlackBerry is receiving e-mail all the time.
Likewise, the big disadvantage of having a BlackBerry is receiving e-mail all
the time. Yes, e-mail is great, but too much e-mail can be counterproductive.
You need to draw the line, right?
If your job requires you to be always outside of the office, it makes sense to
have FYI (for your information) e-mail available on your BlackBerry. But if
you are always in the office during office hours, wouldn’t you rather read
these from your desktop e-mail client instead of your BlackBerry? If you
answer a resounding yes, filtering these types of e-mail makes sense.
The place to create filters is on the Filters tab of the Redirector Settings
screen (see Figure 13-3).
When opening this tab for the first time, you should see two defined sample
filters. Because these filters are not selected, they are not active. You can
view the definition of each filter by clicking the filter name and then clicking
the Edit button. For example, open the first filter named To & BCC Default
(see Figure 13-4) to see how a filter screen is grouped into two parts. The first
is the condition of the message, and the second part is the action you want to
occur when that particular condition is met — whether to forward it to your
BlackBerry or not.
Figure 13-3:
Set filters
here.
290
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

So, what is the purpose of the first filter? Looking at Figure 13-4, you can see
that the Sent Directly to Me and the BCC to Me options are marked in the
Recipient Types section and also that the Forward Message to the Handheld
check box is selected below them. What this filter means is whenever you
receive an e-mail where you are either the TO or BCC recipient, it will be for-
warded to your BlackBerry. Simple, right?
Creating a filter
To create a filter, click the New button on the Filters tab. Clicking New or Edit
gives you the same screen (refer to Figure 13-4) except that all the fields are
empty when you select New. On this screen, enter the name of your filter.
Other sections allow you to define conditions and an action based on the
condition. Going back to Figure 13-4, notice that the conditions (top) portion
of the screen has the following fields to define the scenario you want:
 From: This field allows you to define a condition where you can specify
the sender of the e-mail. Use the Import List button to pick the person or
distribution list from your Address Book. (Figure 13-5 shows what hap-
pens importing from an Outlook Address Book.)
 Sent To: This is a condition where e-mail is sent to the person specified
on this field. Use the Import List button to pick the person or distribu-
tion list from your Address Book.
 Subject: This is a search string on the subject field. For example, if you
enter Alert in this field, it means to forward or not forward the message
(based on the choice you select on the forward setting beneath this) if
the subject of the e-mail has the word alert in it.
 Body: This is the same principle as the Subject field, but this time, the
string is searched in the body of the e-mail.
Figure 13-4:
The To &
BCC Default
sample
filter.
291
Chapter 13: Running Redirector Settings

 Recipient Type: This is the condition based on what type of recipient of
an e-mail you are. The options are straightforward; you can specify
• Sent Directly to Me
• CC to Me
and/or
• BCC to Me
For example, selecting CC to Me means any e-mail that you are CCed on
will follow the action specified on this rule.
 Importance and Sensitivity: These are settings on the e-mail itself.
Possible values are shown in Figure 13-6. For Importance, you can
choose from Low, Normal, or High. For Sensitivity, you can choose from
Normal, Personal, Private, or Confidential.

tance and
sensitivity.

292
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

The bottom portion of the screen contains the possible actions you can do to
an e-mail: either you forward it to the BlackBerry or not. Selecting the Forward
Message to the Handheld radio button gives you an option to specify a Level1
notification (see the section in this chapter titled “Level1 Message: Your Special
Kind of E-Mail”) and also whether the e-mail will be forwarded with the header
information only. Forwarding with header information means that when you
receive that e-mail on your BlackBerry, it won’t have the body portion — only
the subject.
To complete your update on this screen, click OK.
Modifying a filter
Well, not everything works the first time, right? Suppose you define a filter
but notice that it’s not doing what you think it’s supposed to do. Viewing or
updating it is just a matter of going back to the Filters tab of the Redirector
Settings screen. In the middle of this screen are three buttons that you can
use to manage your filters; find the Edit button. First click the filter that you
want to modify and then click the Edit button. You are presented with the
same screen that you used to add the filter, but this time with the information
you entered. Update the filter and then click OK to save your changes.
If you are presented with a list that is maintained using Add, Edit, and Delete
buttons, double-clicking the item defaults to Edit. This is a convention on any
Windows screen, and most of the time, it works on many Windows applica-
tions. In this case, you can open the Edit screen on a filter by double-clicking
its name on the list.
Deleting a filter
Destroying is a much easier task than creating, which holds true for toasting
a filter. All you need to do is go the Filters tab of Redirector Settings screen.
On this tab, you should see the list of your filters. Click the one you want to
remove and then click Delete. As with any delete command, you are prompted
for a confirmation. Clicking Yes at the prompt finishes the delete for you.
Saving and loading filters
After painstakingly figuring out conditions to define your filters, you don’t
want to redo them, right? We’re happy to say you can save these settings to a
file; what you do with that file is up to you. The safest way to store a file like
this is outside your computer’s hard drive — perhaps on a network drive or
in an e-mail that you send to a safe place. The idea is to safely store it some-
where so that you don’t lose it from a possible mishap with your computer.
With this file, you can get back to your settings with just a simple reload.
To save your settings to a file, just open Redirector Settings and go to the
Filters tab. Toward the bottom of the screen, look for the Filter Files section.
293
Chapter 13: Running Redirector Settings

On this section, you find two buttons: Save and Load. They’re exactly what
you think they are, saving your current filters to a file and reloading your fil-
ters from a file, respectively. Check it out.
Level1 Message: Your Special 
Kind of E-Mail
If you want your BlackBerry to beep or vibrate whenever you receive an
urgent e-mail — say, with the word emergency in its subject line — a Level1
Message is your answer. The concept is really simple: A Level1 Message is an
e-mail that meets a certain condition defined on one or more of your
Redirector Settings filter(s). With this particular filter, you can choose to for-
ward the e-mail with a Level1 notification. So, in essence a Level1 Message
could be any e-mail as long as it’s forwarded to your BlackBerry with Level1
notification. This is really designed for special e-mails that you want to be
alerted to.
There are no Level2 and Level3 designations for messages.
On your BlackBerry profile, you can define the type of notifications you want
when you receive a Level1 Message. For example, you can make your device
vibrate or perhaps beep.
Defining a filter for a Level1 Message
To define a filter and set up special conditions for a Level1 Message, you can
create a filter the same as you would create an ordinary filter as we describe
in earlier sections of this chapter. What makes it a Level1 Message is the for-
warding option you set on the filter. Refer to the Add Filter screen (Figure
13-6) to see the Forward with Level1 Notification check box. Marking this
check box tells BlackBerry that any message you receive that qualifies for the
condition you set on this filter will be treated as a Level1 Message. You can
take advantage of this feature to define any criterion(a) for messages requir-
ing your attention. For example, you can have a filter that treats e-mail from
your loved ones (spouse, kids, parents, significant other, and so on) to be
Level1 — after all, these e-mails are important to you. Also, e-mail that is
flagged with high importance and sent directly to you can be treated as
Level1. Or perhaps e-mail coming from your boss.

Assigning a notification 
for Level1 Messages
After you define a Level1 Message by using filters, you can make your device
notify you in a special way. All you need to do is change the behavior for
Level1 Messages on the active profile. Here are the quick and simple steps to
follow:
1. Highlight Profiles from the Home screen and press the trackwheel.
The Profiles screen opens. Note that the active profile you’re using on
your BlackBerry is denoted with (On), as shown in Figure 13-7.
2. Highlight the active profile and press ENTER.
The active profile screen opens. You should see Level1 Messages in this
screen.
3. Highlight Level1 Messages and press ENTER.
A screen similar to the one shown in Figure 13-8 allows you to change
the notification behavior for both out-of-holster and in-holster scenarios.
Out-of-holster is the top part above the dividing line; below the line is
for in-holster. At this point, you can modify the value of the fields.
4. Scroll the trackwheel to select a field and then press the SPACE key to
toggle the possible values.
After you finish changing values, save your changes to make the filter
active.
Figure 13-7:
The Profiles
screen.

Chapter 13: Running Redirector Settings

5. Press the ESC key and then click Save at the prompt that follows.
Whatever changes you entered are now active. You should be able to
test this by sending yourself an e-mail that meets the Level1 notification
condition(s) you have on your filters.
Changing your BlackBerry 
E-mail Signature
If you’re tired of seeing Sent from my BlackBerry on every e-mail you
send, or this signature makes you uncomfortable because people deduce that
you’re not in the office, you can change your signature easily. Do this from
the Redirector Settings screen (although that seems to be the last place to
look for this kind of function). In Redirector Settings, go to the General tab
(refer to Figure 13-2). On this screen, you can see your current signature on
the text field below the Auto Signature section. This is an editable text field,
so you can update it as you like or leave it blank by clearing the current text.
To accept your update, click the Apply or OK button.
Choosing E-Mail Folders to 
Forward to Your BlackBerry
By default, your Inbox is the only folder from your desktop e-mail client that
gets forwarded to your BlackBerry. Most of us define folders on a desktop
e-mail client like Outlook, with rules that automatically move e-mail to these
Figure 13-8:
Notification

296
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

folders. Because they are no longer in your Inbox, these e-mail messages
won’t reach your BlackBerry. If you want to see these messages in these fold-
ers from your device, set your Redirector Settings to include these folders. To
do that, follow these steps:
1. Click the Advanced tab of the Redirector Settings screen of the
BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
The Advanced tab view of the Redirector Settings screen opens (see
Figure 13-9). The Folder Redirection section gives you access to the
function that allows you to define the folders.
2. Select the Selected Folders option and then click the Choose Folders
button.
A Choose Folders screen opens, showing the list of folders you have (see
Figure 13-10). Note that each of the folders has a check box. A checked
folder means that you’re telling Redirector Settings to forward all e-mail
that go to this folder. Go ahead and mark the folders you want included.
3. Click OK on the folder selection screen, and then click OK on the
Redirector Settings screen.
Your changes are saved.
Figure 13-9:

Chapter 13: Running Redirector Settings

After you save your folder selections, any new e-mail gets forwarded to your
BlackBerry. Check it out: On your BlackBerry, go to the Messages application.
At the Messages screen, press the trackwheel to display the menu and then
choose View Folder. The screen that follows lists the e-mail folders you have.
Use your trackwheel to highlight the folder that you want to view and then
press the ENTER key to display the e-mail in that folder. To get back to the
normal view — which is your Inbox — press ESC.

Protecting Your Information
In This Chapter
 Performing a full backup of your BlackBerry information
 Scheduling auto backups
 Restoring from backups
 Selectively backing up your BlackBerry information
I
magine that you left your BlackBerry in the back of a cab or on the train.
You’ve lost your BlackBerry for good. Okay, not good. So what happens to
all your information? Have you lost it forever? What about information secu-
rity? Can anyone have unauthorized access to your personal information?
One thing that you don’t need to worry about is information security —
assuming that you set up a security password on your BlackBerry. With a
security password protection, anyone who finds your BlackBerry has only
ten chances to enter the correct password; after those ten chances are up,
it’s self-destruction time. Although it’s not as smoky and dramatic as what
you see on Mission Impossible, your BlackBerry does erase all its information
in such a scenario, thwarting your would-be data thief. Therefore, set up a
password for your BlackBerry! Refer to Chapter 2 for how to set up a pass-
word on your BlackBerry.
What you do need to worry about is how to get back all your information on
your BlackBerry. If you’re like us and you store important information on
your BlackBerry, this chapter is for you. Vital information such as clients’ and
friends’ contact information, notes from phone calls with clients — and, of
course, those precious e-mail messages — should not be taken lightly.
Backing up this information is a reliable way to protect information from
being lost forever.
In this chapter, we show how you can prevent losing information on your
BlackBerry by backing it up on your PC. Then we show you how to restore
and recover that information you’ve backed up.

Accessing Backup and Restore
Backup and Restore is a mini-application within the BlackBerry Desktop
Manager (BDM). For instructions on installing BDM, see Chapter 11. After
BlackBerry Desktop Manager is installed on your PC, you can connect 
your BlackBerry to your PC by using the USB cable that comes with your
BlackBerry. If everything is set up properly, you see a pop-up window on your
PC prompting you to type in your BlackBerry security password. After you
enter your correct password, your BlackBerry is connected to your PC.
To access Backup and Restore, double-click the Backup and Restore icon
within the BlackBerry Desktop Manager. Doing so opens Backup and Restore
screen (see Figure 14-1). From this point, you’re ready to backup or restore
information from or to your BlackBerry.
Backing Up BlackBerry Style
We all know that backing up your data provides tremendous peace of mind
when protecting your data. So do the folks at RIM, which is why they made
backing up your information quite easy. You can back up your data manually
or set it to autopilot.
Backing up your BlackBerry manually
To back up your BlackBerry manually
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
The Back and Restore screen appears (refer to Figure 14-1).
Figure 14-1:
The Backup
and Restore
screen.
300
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

2. From the Backup and Restore screen, click the Backup button.
A Save window appears, asking you what the backup file should be
named and where you want it saved on your PC (see Figure 14-2).
3. From the Save window, pick a place to save your backup file and then
click the Save button.
BlackBerry Desktop Manager automatically starts backing up your
BlackBerry information onto your PC. You can follow the backup progress
from the Transfer In Progress window that appears. See Figure 14-3.
Figure 14-3:
A backup in
progress.
Figure 14-2:
Set where
to save your
backup file.
301
Chapter 14: Protecting Your Information

Do not unplug your BlackBerry from the PC until the backup process fin-
ishes! Depending on how much information you have on your BlackBerry,
it might take more than a moment (five to ten minutes) to finish.
When the Transfer In Progress window disappears, you are finished with
the BlackBerry backup process.
Setting up auto backups
What is better than backing up your information once? Remembering to back
up regularly! What’s better than regularly backing up? You guessed it —
having your PC and BlackBerry run backups automatically. After you sched-
ule automated backups of your BlackBerry, you can really have peace of mind
when it comes to preventing information loss.
To set up an auto backup
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
The Backup and Restore screen opens (refer to Figure 14-1).
2. From the Backup and Restore screen in Desktop Manager, click the
Options button.
Doing so opens up Backup and Restore Options screen, where you can
schedule automatic backups (see Figure 14-4).
3. Enable the Automatically Backup My Handheld Every xx option.
This enables you to configure more options (check boxes and options
become active), like how often Desktop Manager should back up your
BlackBerry.
Figure 14-4:
Set auto
backups
here.
302
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

4. Select the number of days, between 1 and 99, in the numeric Day text
field.
This interval sets how often your BlackBerry will be backed up. For
example, if you enter 14 days, your BlackBerry will be backed up every
14 days.
5. Under the When Automatically Backing Up My Handheld section,
select the Backup All Handheld Application Data radio button.
This backs up all the data on your handheld each time auto backup runs.
Although you have the option to exclude e-mail messages and/or infor-
mation, such as from Address Book, to-do’s, and memos, we recommend
that you back up everything each time without any exclusion.
6. Confirm your settings by clicking OK.
Now you can go on with your life without caring too much about backing
up information on your BlackBerry.
In order to run a back up, you need to connect your BlackBerry to your PC
and have BlackBerry Desktop Manager up and running. Thus, if you travel
often or just don’t link your BlackBerry to your PC often, make sure you plug
your BlackBerry into your PC once in a while so the auto backup has a
chance to back up your information.
Full Restore from Backup Information
We hope that you never have to read this section more than once because
every time you perform a full restore from backup, it probably means that
you’ve lost information that you hoped to find from the backup you created
on your PC.
The steps to fully restoring your backup information are simple:
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
This opens up Backup and Restore screen (refer to Figure 14-1).
2. From the Backup and Restore screen, click the Restore button.
Doing so brings up a typical Open file window, asking you where the
backup file is located on your PC.
3. From the file-selection window, pick a backup file of your choice and
then click Open.
A Warning window appears (see Figure 14-5) alerting you that you’re
about to overwrite existing information.
303
Chapter 14: Protecting Your Information

4. From this Warning window, click OK to proceed with the full restore.
A progress bar similar to Figure 14-3 now appears, showing progress of
the full restore. When the progress bar disappears, your BlackBerry is
now fully restored from the backup file.
It might take a while for the full restore to finish. Do not unplug your
BlackBerry from your PC during this time!
Protecting Your Data, Your Way
A certain burger joint and BlackBerry have in common that you have it your
way with their products. Just like you can get your burger with or without all
the extras (like pickles and onions), you can choose to not backup/restore
things that you know you won’t need.
For example, say you have accidentally deleted all your Browser bookmarks,
and now you want them back. The thing not to do is to restore all the infor-
mation from your last backup, which could potentially be more than 90 days
old (depending on how often your auto-backup runs, if it does). Doing so
might overwrite other information, such as e-mail or your Address Book con-
tacts. The easiest thing to do is use the selective backup/restore function on
the BlackBerry Desktop Manager and to restore only Browser bookmarks.
The same idea goes with backing up. If you are a big e-mail user and your
mailbox is constantly growing, you can choose to back up just your e-mails
and nothing else.
In this section, we use the term databases. Don’t worry; this isn’t as technical
as you think. Think of a database as an information category on the BlackBerry.
Figure 14-5:
Take
caution
when
overwriting
existing info.
304
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

For example, backing up your Browser bookmarks database is just a fancy way
of saying backing up all your Browser bookmarks on your BlackBerry.
We start with selective backup and then go over restoring selectively.
Backing up, your way
To show you how to perform selective backups, we back up just e-mails and
Browser bookmarks as an example.
To back up selectively
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
This opens up Backup and Restore screen (refer to Figure 14-1).
2. From the Backup and Restore screen in Desktop Manager, click the
Advanced button.
Doing so opens up the Advanced Backup/Restore screen, as shown in
Figure 14-6, where you can see different information categories, or data-
bases, of your BlackBerry handheld on the right side of the window.
3. From the Advanced Backup/Restore screen, Ctrl+click Browser
Bookmarks and Browser Messages as the databases that you want to
back up. Then click the Backup button (the big left-facing arrow).
A progress bar moves while your BlackBerry is backed up selectively. This
step merely transfers the databases onto your PC; it does not save them.
When the backup transfer is finished, you can see the two databases on
the left side of the window.
Figure 14-6:
The
Advanced
Backup/
Restore
screen.
305
Chapter 14: Protecting Your Information

4. From the Advanced Backup/Restore Screen, choose File➪Save As.
This opens a Save window, where you can specify where to save your
selective backup as well as what to name it.
5. From the Save window, name your file and save it on your PC.
You still need to manually save the backup file on your PC even after you pick
a location for the file, as you specify in Step 3. A selective backup does not
automatically save your backup on your PC.
Restoring, your way
Selective restoring works in a similar way to a selective backup; however, when
restoring, you need to already have a backup file to restore from. Although this
might sound overly obvious to you, the point we are making is that you can
selectively restore from any backup, auto or manual. For example, say you have
auto backup running every other day, and you want to restore just your e-mail
messages from two days ago. You don’t need to do a full restore because that
might overwrite some of the new contacts in your Address Book. Rather, you
can use the selective restoring method and get back only your e-mail messages.
To restore your way
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
This opens up the Backup and Restore screen (refer to Figure 14-1).
2. From the Backup and Restore screen in Desktop Manager, click the
Advanced button.
Doing so opens up Advanced Backup/Restore screen, where you can see
different information categories, or databases, of your BlackBerry hand-
held on the right-hand side of the window (refer to Figure 14-6).
3. From the Advanced Backup/Restore screen, choose File➪Open.
This opens an Open file window, where you can choose which backup
file you want to restore from.
A BlackBerry backup file has an .ipd suffix.
4. Select a backup file of your choice and then click the Open button.
This displays the different information categories, or databases, on the
left-hand side of the Advanced Backup/Restore screen.
You are now ready for selective restore.
306
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

5. Pick categories of your choice. You can select multiple databases by
Ctrl+clicking the databases you want.
6. When you finish selecting the databases, click the Restore button 
(the big right-facing arrow) of the Advanced Backup/Restore screen.
You will likely see a Warning window asking whether you wish to replace
all the information with the data you are restoring; refer to Figure 14-5.
If your handheld has the same categories as the ones you are restoring
(which is very likely), you will overwrite any information you have on
your handheld.
You can confidently click OK if you know that the database you’re restor-
ing has the information you’re looking for.
7. From the Warning window, click OK.
A progress bar similar to the one in Figure 14-3 appears while the selec-
tive restore is in progress. When the progress bar window disappears,
the information categories that you’ve selected are restored on your
BlackBerry.
Clearing BlackBerry information, 
your way
You can also clear or delete information on your BlackBerry selectively from
the BlackBerry Desktop Manager. And when would you use selective dele-
tion? Suppose you want to clear only your phone logs from your BlackBerry.
One way is to tediously select one phone log at a time and press Delete, and
then repeat that until all phone logs are deleted. However, a faster way is to
use the selective deleting. The idea is to delete a database from the Advanced
Backup/Restore screen by using the Backup and Restore function of the
BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
To selectively delete databases on your BlackBerry
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
The Backup and Restore screen appears (refer to Figure 14-1).
2. From the Backup and Restore screen in Desktop Manager, click the
Advanced button.
Doing so opens up Advanced Backup/Restore Screen, where you can see
different information categories, or databases, of your BlackBerry hand-
held on the right side of the window (refer to Figure 14-6).
307
Chapter 14: Protecting Your Information

3. From the Advanced Backup/Restore screen, Ctrl+click the database(s)
you want to delete.
This highlights the database(s).
4. From the Advanced Backup/Restore Screen, click the Clear button on
the right-hand side of the screen.
A Warning window appears, asking you to confirm your deletion.
5. From the Warning window, click OK.
A progress bar appears, showing progress of the deletion. When the
progress bar disappears, the information categories that you selected
are now cleared from your BlackBerry.

Ten (Or So) New Features on the
New Generation BlackBerry
In This Chapter
 Your roadmap to new features on the new generation BlackBerry
 Where to find out about more features in this book
I
n addition to its many slick new features, such as more memory and
Bluetooth support, the newest generation of BlackBerry, when running
under the BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS) — or BlackBerry Enterprise
Service (BES) for corporate/government users — supports a wide variety of
what we call handheld services.
In this chapter, we review ten new features of the new generation BlackBerry,
including new handheld features as well as new handheld services that
almost any BlackBerry handheld user can enjoy. We start with the new physi-
cal features and then move on to the new services. Please check our compan-
ion Web site for this book (www.blackberryfordummies.com) for an
updated list.
Handheld Features
The new generation BlackBerry is more powerful than ever. It has most — if
not all — the features from the older generations plus more advanced capa-
bilities. If you have a BlackBerry 7100 series, BlackBerry 7290/7250, or
BlackBerry 7520 model, you can consider yourself a lucky owner of a new
generation BlackBerry.

Display screen
The first thing you’ll notice on a new generation BlackBerry is how vibrant
the new display screens look compared with the old monochrome display
screens. For example, if you take a look at the 7100 series, the display screen
has a higher resolution and more color than an old color-screen BlackBerry.
With the higher-resolution screen, you can now view photos of loved ones on
your BlackBerry just like you would on a PC. You can even set the photos to
be your BlackBerry Home screen background.
Memory
Although not as apparent as the display screen, the increase in memory
capacity is equally, if not more, important. With more memory, your
BlackBerry not only can perform better, but it can hold more data as well.
You don’t need to clean out your old e-mail as often although we do recom-
mend that you back up your BlackBerry frequently. (See Chapter 14 for more
on backing up your BlackBerry.)
A new generation BlackBerry model has 32MB (megabytes) of memory,
double what the old generation has.
Bluetooth
You’ve likely heard a lot about Bluetooth these days, but what exactly is
Bluetooth? Think of Bluetooth as a replacement for traditional wires that go
from one device to another. Although Bluetooth has been around for a few
years, the most practical use of Bluetooth has been connectivity between a
wireless device (like the BlackBerry) and a headset.
With your BlackBerry, you can pair your BlackBerry only with headset or car
kits. After your BlackBerry is paired with a Bluetooth headset, you can talk
into that headset and move freely without any wires between the headset and
your BlackBerry. For more information on a wireless headset for your
BlackBerry, please see Chapter 16 for Bluetooth accessories.
At the time of this writing, a portable Bluetooth keyboard is available that
can be paired with a BlackBerry, but this hasn’t been tested by RIM.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

SureType
If you’ve ever tried to text-message someone from a cellphone, you know how
slow and painful it can be. For example, if you need to type just the letter C,
you have to press the number 2 button three times. Imagine spelling the word
Cathy. We won’t even go into the confusion of capitalizing a letter. However,
with the introduction of BlackBerry 7100 Series, RIM resolved the pain of
typing on a cellphone by creating SureType.
SureType is a new twist to your typical keyboard (a QWERTY keyboard). On
the surface, the 7100 has all the letters of a QWERTY keyboard displayed on
the handheld despite having fewer physical keys on the 7100 series than on a
regular QWERTY BlackBerry. Thus, the 7100 series is smaller than a QWERTY
BlackBerry but without compromising the QWERTY typing experience.
With SureType, you can now type single-handedly or two-handedly, both with
ease. What makes it work is that SureType can predict your next character or
words with amazing accuracy. Best of all, it learns how you type; so the more
you use it, the more accurate its prediction capability gets. For more on
SureType and how to master it, please refer to Chapter 2.
Wi-Fi/VoIP
The only BlackBerry model that offers VoIP — Voice over IP: that is, voice
delivered using the Internet Protocol — is the BlackBerry 7270, and it is avail-
able only to corporations. BlackBerry 7270 takes advantage of corporate Wi-
Fi (wireless fidelity) and corporate VoIP infrastructure so workers can roam
freely within the company as if they were at their desks.
Theme
The new generation of BlackBerry can have customizable themes. Think of
this as customizing your PC desktop how you like. For more on customizing
your BlackBerry, refer to Chapter 2.

Wallpaper/Picture Viewer
With a new generation BlackBerry, you can view pictures downloaded from
your BlackBerry Browser in the Pictures application and even make it your
BlackBerry wallpaper (Home screen background). For more on this, read
Chapter 2.
Ring tone
Even though your BlackBerry comes loaded with different ring tones, you can
differentiate your BlackBerry by downloading different ring tones. For more
on ring tones, refer to Chapter 2. For information on BlackBerry Phone, refer
to Chapter 10.
New Handheld Services
New handheld services come with the collaboration of the new BIS or BES 4.0
along with BlackBerry OS 4.0 on the handheld. In conjunction, you can enjoy
the following new features, regardless of what handheld model you have.
If you have an older BlackBerry — say, a BlackBerry 6280 model — you can
upgrade your BlackBerry OS to version 4.0 (see Chapter 12 for more details)
so that it can work with the BES 4.0. Then you can enjoy viewing e-mail
attachments (PowerPoint, Excel, and JPEGs), or you can have wireless e-mail
sync. (See Chapter 7 for more details.)
Wireless sync e-mail
E-mail capability has always been a strong point of the BlackBerry, but now it’s
even better with wireless reconciliation between e-mail on your handheld and
e-mail on your PC. Furthermore, you can now view attachments (PowerPoint,
Excel, Word, PDFs, and more) on your BlackBerry as you would on your PC. For
more details, see Chapter 7.
Wireless calendar sync
Like wireless reconciliation of your e-mail, your calendar events can also be
reconciled between your BlackBerry and PC. You can even accept or decline
meeting notices sent to you via your BlackBerry. For more details, see
Chapter 4.

Browser
With more and more on-the-go information available on the Internet, your
browser experience on your BlackBerry becomes more crucial than ever. And
with the new Browser application on BlackBerry OS 4.0 — along with BES 4.0 —
the pages that you visit on your BlackBerry Browser are more legible and
accessible than before. For more on good BlackBerry Web surfing experiences,
read Chapters 9 and 20.

Ten Great BlackBerry Accessories
In This Chapter
 BlackBerry accessories you can’t live without
 Where to buy them
T
he BlackBerry retail box contains a few essentials: a battery, a charger,
and a belt clip. If you’re like us, though, you’re not satisfied with what is
included in the box. In this chapter, we present those accessories that we
think supplement your BlackBerry well and also where to shop for them.
Please check our companion Web site, www.blackberryfordummies.com,
for an updated list.
Cases for Protection and Style 
(Belt Clip)
Regardless of which BlackBerry model you have, the belt clip that comes
with your BlackBerry does the job, even if lacks that personal touch. Don’t
worry, though, because you have plenty of cases to choose from. Whether
you like more of a sporty look or a professional look, here are couple of rec-
ommendations. These cases will set you back any where from $20–$40 US,
which isn’t too bad for looking hip.
Here’s where you can buy a new belt clip:
 BlackBerryStuff.com: http://www.blackberrystuff.com/
blackberry-case.htm
 BlackBerrySource.com: www.blackberrysource.com
When you buy a new belt clip, buy one made specifically for your BlackBerry
model.

BlackBerry Protector Case
If the sight of a scratched BlackBerry display screen hurts your feelings 
(or hampers your view), you know the importance of a good screen protec-
tor. The only thing we found that will protect your BlackBerry from daily
abuses is the SkinTight BlackBerry rubber case and holster. Although this
product should probably be listed in the preceding section, this case
impresses us so much that it deserves its own category. 
For around $35 US, you can buy SkinTight from Speck Products:
 For 7100 series: www.speckproducts.com/bb7100t.html
 For 7290/7230 models: www.speckproducts.com/bb7290.html
BlackBerry Screen Protector
If the protector case described in the preceding section is a bit stressful for
your wallet, then try Screenguardz, for only $12 US. Your screen will be
scratchless with Screenguardz.
You can get it from BlackBerrySource.com, at
www.blackberrysource.com/store/catalog.asp?item=189
Long Live Your BlackBerry 
(Extra Battery)
An extra battery for your BlackBerry will come in handy if you are a daily
BlackBerry user. We recommend that you buy your battery only from
Research In Motion (RIM) (the maker of BlackBerry) and not from some other
manufacturer because a faulty battery can seriously damage your BlackBerry
beyond repair.
You have two battery type choices: extended or regular. Of course, extended
means longer battery life versus the regular battery. You’ll spend around $75
US for the extended life and around $35 US for the regular life.
You can buy them from

Part V: The Part of Tens 

 BlackBerrySource.com: www.blackberrysource.com
 BlackBerryStuff.com: www.blackberrystuff.com/
blackberry-battery.htm
Make sure the battery you buy is for your BlackBerry model.
Replenishing Your BlackBerry
If you have a colorized BlackBerry, you know that the battery needs to be
charged every couple of days. And if you’re always on the go, you better have a
portable charger on hand. The charger that’s included with your BlackBerry is
great to carry around town (and the world) because it has multiple adapters
for different countries’ electric plugs. The one we recommend is the BlackBerry
Car Charger, which is great for all you road warriors out there. It will set you
back around $30 US.
The place to get your car charger is from the official RIM online shopping
store: www.shopblackberry.com.
Make sure that the charger you buy is for your BlackBerry model.
Bluetooth Hands-Free Headset
If you’re a frequent phone user, we definitely recommend that you pick up a
Bluetooth hands-free headset. Even though a wired hands-free headset comes
with your BlackBerry, the convenience of a wireless Bluetooth hands-free
headset is hard to live without.
Plenty of Bluetooth headsets are on the market for you to choose from, but
only a handful have been tested by RIM. We list RIM’s officially tested head-
sets here:
 Jabra BT250v
 Logitech Mobile Freedom

Chapter 16: Ten Great BlackBerry Accessories

The trick in picking these things are a comfortable fit, a rechargeable battery,
and voice quality. Also, make sure that your BlackBerry is Bluetooth-enabled
before you buy a Bluetooth headset.
You probably need to spend anywhere from $50–$100 US for these hands-free
headsets. The best place to get your Bluetooth headset is good ol’ Amazon.
com: www.amazon.com.
Full Keyboard
If you compose long e-mails and you draft long proposals on your BlackBerry,
a full-sized keyboard is perfect for you. Not only will you save on typing time,
but you will also save your thumbs from blistering.
You have your choice of Bluetooth and non-Bluetooth connection options.
Bluetooth
At the time of writing, only one portal Bluetooth keyboard was available. 
We plan to offer more updates on this on our Web site, 
www.blackberryfordummies.com.
For less than $100 US, you can own this cool Bluetooth keyboard. Not too bad
for a wireless keyboard. Here’s where to get the one that’s available: eAccess
Solutions, at www.eaccess-estore.com.
Non-Bluetooth
For a non-Bluetooth connection option, you can use USB or direct connect. 
A direct-connect keyboard attaches directly to your BlackBerry whereas USB
has a cable that goes from your BlackBerry to the keyboard.
Direct connect
For less than $50 US, you can grab one of these at

USB cable
For about $200 US, you can get this USB cable keyboard. A bit stiff, but
depending on how you use your BlackBerry, it might be a good investment.
Go to Man & Machine at www.man-machine.com/coolmir.htm.
External Speaker Phone
Even though some of you have a BlackBerry that comes with a speaker
phone, sometimes the sound quality just isn’t good enough for you to com-
prehend the phone conversation while in a car. Check out the wireless
Bluetooth speaker phone, Blue Vision Bluetooth Speakerphone.
For about $100 US, you can get it from BlackBerrySource.com:
www.blackberrysource.com/store/catalog.asp?item=236
BlackBerry Car Mount

your BlackBerry in your car with the Auto PDA Holder Kit. For about $30 US,
your BlackBerry will be securely fastened to the Auto PDA Holder so 
that your BlackBerry is in your sight at all times.

 Where to download them
U
p to this point in the book, we show you how you can be productive 
by multitasking with your BlackBerry. If you ever need help to be 
even more productive, here are ten applications that can help you get that
extra squeeze. Please check our companion Web site for this book at www.
blackberryfordummies.com for an updated list.
WorldMate for BlackBerry
If you’re a frequent flier, this is the application for you. You can get updated
flight information on your BlackBerry for over 800 airlines, so if your flight is
delayed, you can know in advance. You can also get local information about
the destination that you are traveling to, but the features don’t stop there.
WorldMate also has up-to-date weather forecasts, a currency converter, and
world time.
To download, go to www.handango.com on your PC and search for
“WorldMate”.
DocHawk

ment formats, the screens aren’t quite like what you’re used to seeing on a

closer to what you’d expect on a PC.

If you often find yourself viewing PowerPoint presentations, PDFs, and other
attachments, this is a good investment.
For a price of $40 US per year (other pricing available), you can download
DocHawk from the following sites:

Think of RSS (Really Simple Syndication) as a way for you to get many forms
of information via a PC — or this case, your BlackBerry.
With BerryVine RSS Reader, getting to your RSS feed is easy; you can also cat-
egorize, search, and sort the RSS feed.
For about $7 US, you can download BerryVine at
http://bb.berryvine.com/BVRSS/OTA/BerryVineRSSReader.jad
eOffice
If you ever wished that you had Microsoft Office on your BlackBerry, stop
wishing. Having eOffice is like having Office on your BlackBerry. Along with a

you’re away from the office. With eOffice, you can view and compose Word,
Excel, and other Office-compatible documents right from your BlackBerry.

to www.handango.com and searching for “Ascendo photo”.

to www.handango.com and searching for “mortgagesolver”.

your instant message accounts by using just one application.
For about $35 US, you can download it from your PC by going to www.
handango.com and searching for “verichat”.

If you’ve ever wished that your BlackBerry could proofread your e-mails for
spelling errors, with bbSpell, it can. After installation, the spell checker is
built into the Messages application, so right before you send out your e-mail,
you can make sure that all your spelling is proper.

Ten Fun Games on Your

 Ten games that will jazz up your BlackBerry
 Where to download them

ho says BlackBerry is all work and no play? True, you can get tons
accomplished on your BlackBerry, but who says what you get accom-
plished needs to be work-related? Yes, you do have the BrickBreaker game
that comes with most colorized versions of the BlackBerry, but you can only
beat it so many times before you get bored with it.

couple of holes on the Pebble Beach golf course, or you can play a game of
online Texas Hold ’Em with other BlackBerry users. So whatever you play,
you can find a huge selection of games out there. What’s even better is that
some great games are free.

Ten Must-Have BlackBerry
Programs
In This Chapter
 Ten must-have applications for your BlackBerry
 Where to download these applications
T
he industry of BlackBerry software is literally exploding at a dizzying
rate. It’s no longer easy to find out which of these applications are getting
traction and hitting the mainstream user base, not to mention which ones are
worth using.
In Chapter 17, we give you ten programs that should help increase your pro-
ductivity — and in Chapter 18, another ten programs to entertain you and
have fun with. In this chapter, we introduce ten more applications that aren’t
necessarily designed to entertain or make you more productive. However,
these are great programs; whether you will like them depends on your per-
sonality. Because space limits us to highlight only ten from the hundreds or
perhaps already thousands of applications out there, we tried to cover the
most common needs each one of us has.
There are no specific reviews to quote, but these choices are the results of
our quest to find programs that people use, discerned either from postings
on message boards or commentaries in the public domain. There are
BlackBerry “addicts” out there, for good reasons. Their blogs are valuable to
help you narrow down a few programs to focus and test. Some of this soft-
ware is free, but never underestimate the freebies; those that we include here
are really useful and neat. The rest that we present here are the ones that
won’t cost you an arm and a leg.
The ten applications we feature here are just the tip of the iceberg. By all
means, feel free to surf the ’Net because by the time this book is published,
more software will likely be available. And don’t forget to visit our Web site at
www.blackberryfordummies.com.

BBWeather
This program allows you to subscribe to weather updates for a location you
specify. The data comes from weather.com, and you can set it up by using
locator identification. This is different from the weather forecast presented in
BBToday (see its upcoming section) because BBToday gives you a summa-
rized view whereas BBWeather gives you more detailed information, such as
UV index, wind speed, humidity, barometric pressure, dew point, visibility,
times for sunrise and sunset, and also the phase of the moon. You can config-
ure the forecast screen for a number of days forward. The forecast screen
includes the usual weather information plus precipitation, wind speed, and
humidity.
To download, go to www.blackberrycool.com from your PC. You can find
BBWeather on the Software Directory and in the Free Software section. Again,
this is another freebie, so there’s no reason for not getting it.
Berry411
Here’s another free program in your arsenal. Berry411 works the same as you
local 411 information source, but you don’t have to pay for the service. You
are carrying yellow as well as white pages. We found this very useful to get
movie times for local movie theaters. If you’re traveling, simply use the
address information of the hotel where you’re staying, and Berry411 allows
you to get local information based on that address.
To download, go to www.blackberrycool.com from your PC. You can find
Berry411 at the Software Directory and in the Free Software section.
BlackBerryGoodies BB Blogger
If you have ever wanted to put something on your blog site while it’s fresh in
your mind, you’re not alone. For those of you maintaining a blog, you can
download this software for free, which uses the Google blog infrastructure,
allowing you to post your blog and also read other people’s blogs.
From your PC or your BlackBerry Browser, go to www.blackberrygoodies.

AskMeNow
Stop scratching your head. When you have a pressing question, you don’t
need to look for answers anywhere other than your BlackBerry. After you
install this application, a guru is ready to answer that nagging question in
your head. If your query can possibly be answered by a human being, you
can ask it here. If you don’t know what to ask, AskMeNow has pre-canned
questions like directions, weather, sports updates, flight information, and so
on. The answer is sent to you through e-mail, usually within two minutes.
Initially, the service was free, but someone has to pay for the resources these
guys are putting up, right? AskMeNow now charges a monthly fee, so check that
you are comfortable with this amount before you commit to it. However, the ser-
vice is excellent. Many people give very good feedback, and we like it, too.
For a free trial download, from your BlackBerry, go to www.askmenow.com/
blackberry/ota.html. Or you can buy it for about $6 US from 
www.handango.com (search for “AskMeNow”).
Stock Ticker
In the world of stock market, timing is everything. For those of you who are
actively trading — if you can’t enjoy your latté without worrying about what’s
going on with your stocks — here is a piece of software that helps. You get
the latest quotes and stock information, even when you’re not looking at your
three stock-monitor terminals. It features a scrolling interface with minute-by-
minute news and commentaries.
For about $25 US for six-month usage, you can download Stock Ticker from
your PC by going to www.handango.com and searching for “Stock Ticker”.
Wisespent Professional
Now, this is cool — expense tracker software, right on your handheld. The
developer of this software really listens to its customers and makes many
updates based on customers’ feedback and requests. At the time of writing,
the software is version 3.0. What’s really nice about Wisespent is its support
for importing data to popular expense software like Quicken.
For about $23 US, you can download Wisespent Professional from your PC by
going to www.wisespent.com.

Chapter 19: Ten Must-Have BlackBerry Programs

Freenews
From its name, you could guess what this application gives you — news! The
two editions are Corporate and Personal. What’s great about Freenews is that
you can customize it to give you the information you really care about. Sure,
you can get all the same news via a Web browser. However, what’s great
about Freenews is that it does its downloading behind the scenes. After an
article is on your device, you can read it even when you go out of coverage.
Other features include sharing articles with friends, choosing the feed
source, and getting news based on keywords. However, unlike its name sug-
gest, Freenews isn’t free; it will run you about $20 US.
To download. go to www.handango.com from your PC and search for
“Freenews”.
Ascendo Fitness for BlackBerry
For the heath-conscious among us, here is award-winning software for your
BlackBerry. This software allows you to take control of your health by help-
ing you track the calories from what you eat and how you burn them in your
exercise (hopefully, you’re doing it regularly). It presents your progress by
showing you graphs that are easy to understand. Based on your personal
data, Ascendo has calculators that give you what should be your ideal or
healthy weight, your Body Mass Index (BMI), maximum heart rate based on
age, and Basal Metabolism Ratio (BMR). We have heard many good com-
ments from those who use this product.
For about $20 US, you can download Ascendo Fitness from your PC by going
to www.handango.com and searching for “Ascendo fitness”. Or, go to
www.ascendo-inc.com/Fitness.html for more information.
BBToday
If you’re experiencing information overload, you’re not alone. BBToday helps
you make sense of all this information without so much hair-pulling. In a nut-
shell, BBToday tries to give you a tear sheet on a daily basis. The nice thing
about BBToday is its capability to show up every time you unlock or open
your BlackBerry. It displays full screen with the following information in a
summarized format:
334
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Current date and time
 E-mail summary
 Remaining battery strength
 Signal strength
 Appointments scheduled for the day
 Tasks scheduled for the day
 Current weather information and five-day forecast
 Phone call summary
 Stock quotes
This is like having an assistant tell you what your day will be like, organizing
your PIM (personal information manager) information and presenting it in
such a way that you don’t have to spend time viewing each of your PIM appli-
cations. You can configure the weather to point to your local area. You can
also add the stock ticker for the stock quotes section.
You can download BBToday for free from your BlackBerry by going to
http://blackberrytools.sourceforge.net/OverTheAir/
bbtoday-1.5/BBToday.jad.
SportSeeker
For the sport fanatics among us, we have not forgotten you. This software
sports a cutting-edge wireless service, delivering the latest sports news,
scores, schedules, and standings for the major sports straight to your hand-
held in real time. It covers the major sports, including MLB, NFL, NCAA foot-
ball and basketball, NBA, NHL, PGA tour, and NASCAR. Get up-to-the-minute
scores even when you’re not watching TV or listening to the radio. For your
analysis, SportSeeker gives you latest standings and statistics as well as com-
prehensive league schedules of your favorite sports. The downside is that
SportSeeker works only on the 7100 series model — and you have to pony up
a monthly subscription.
For about $5 US, you can download SportSeeker from your PC by going to
www.handango.com and searching for “SportSeeker”. Or, you can find out

Ten (More or Less) Web Site
Categories for BlackBerrry
Browsing
In This Chapter
 Great surfing sites for the BlackBerry
 What we do and don’t like about these sites
W
e’re sure that you’ve been to Web sites that looked great on your PC
but horrible on your BlackBerry Browser. You know, like how on your
desktop PC, Yahoo!.com looks fabulous with vibrant colors, but when you
point your BlackBerry Browser there, notice how long it takes to load that
page. And when the page does finish loading (if it ever does), you get images
and text all bunched together, which you can’t possibility comprehend. For
BlackBerry users, this lack of readability might have led you to stop using
your BlackBerry Browser altogether.
However, you don’t need to give up surfing the Web on your BlackBerry. To
have a good experience surfing on your BlackBerry is simple: Where you surf
is what matters. So what does that mean? Psst: Many popular Web sites have
two versions — one for a PC Web browser and another for mobile device
browsers, like BlackBerry Browser.
In this chapter, we show you the Web sites that are specifically made to be
viewed on a BlackBerry Browser, so the next time you need information from
the Web, you don’t need to run to your PC. Rather, get it instantly from your
BlackBerry. Please check our companion Web site for this book — www.
blackberryfordummies.com — for an updated list.
Note: You have to access all links in this chapter from your BlackBerry for
them to work.

Weather
Weather changes quite often, but you can keep up with the changes with
these sites from your BlackBerry.
AccuWeather.com
www.accuweather.com/pda/pda_5dy.asp?act=L
AccuWeather.com provides the local weather forecast.
 Pro: Simple and easy to use. After you enter your location for the first
time, bookmark the resulting page for your location. You can then get
your local weather forecast without entering your location again.
 Con: A few small images on the forecast page make the site load more
slowly than it should, but not by much.
Yahoo! Weather
http://home.mobile.yahoo.com
This is part of the Yahoo! mobile portal site that provides a weather forecast.
 Pro: If you have an account with Yahoo!, you can have personalized
weather set up for multiple locations.
 Con: None at the moment.
News
The following sites are news Web sites for general news although many also
have sections on business news and sports.
BBC News
www.bbc.co.uk/mobile/web/index.shtml
You can read news from BBC right from your BlackBerry, even if you’re not in
the UK.
338
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Pro: The site is very BlackBerry friendly with a good deal of world news.
There are no advertisement banners or annoying images to load.
 Con: The weather, traffic, and other information are UK-centric, which
isn’t so great if you’re not a UK resident.
USA Today
www.usatoday.com/wireless
One of the most popular newspapers is now available for free from your
BlackBerry.
 Pro: We like the listing of news in different categories on the very first
page, where you can browse through all the news before choosing to
read one particular article. Also, news articles are presented in one
page, so there is no need to load multiple pages to keep reading, which
is great if you know you’re about to lose your signal (like in a subway).
 Con: There is one picture on the very first page, which is the stock
market chart. Depending on your network coverage at the time of load-
ing, this can take a while to load.
Yahoo! News
http://home.mobile.yahoo.com
This is part of the Yahoo! mobile portal site that provides different categories
of news.
 Pro: Yahoo! News has a great selection of news within many helpful cate-
gories. The news coverage is great, so instead of buying the morning
newspaper, you can get your morning news from here.
 Con: None at the moment.
ABC News
wap.go.com/abcnews
Get ABC News on TV on your BlackBerry.
339
Chapter 20: Ten (More or Less) Web Site Categories for BlackBerrry Browsing

 Pro: Very similar to Yahoo! News, this site features a simple layout, with
no banners or pictures to load.
 Con: We don’t like the intro page that you get after selecting an article. It
gives you the option to read the full story or go back. We feel that is
unnecessary.
All sites in this chapter have to be accessed from your BlackBerry directly for
them to work.
PR Newswire
www.prnewswire.com/tnw/tnw.shtml
If you’re out of the office but want to keep up with the latest news, you can
with your BlackBerry via accessing this site.
 Pro: This site is great for up-to the-minute news.
 Con: This site isn’t great for news browsing because it doesn’t break
down the news by category.
Google
www.google.com/xhtml
The king of search engines does not disappoint with a mobile version of its
power search engine. This version of the Google search “transforms” regular
Web sites and makes them mobile-device-friendly.
 Pro: We very much like the Mobile Web search option, which gives you
only those sites made to be viewed on a mobile device, like a
BlackBerry. Although it is still in beta testing phase, Mobile Web will
eventually graduate and become a vital product in Google.
 Con: The transformed Web sites don’t always work properly; it depends
on the site you search for.
Portals
The following sites in this section are Web portals, which are sites that con-
tain various information and/or links to other sites.
340
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Yahoo! Mobile
http://home.mobile.yahoo.com
The Yahoo! Mobile portal site allows BlackBerry users to employ regular
Yahoo! functions, such as Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! Messenger, driving directions,
weather, and more.
 Pro: Yahoo! does a great job with the mobile version of its original site. It
loads very fast, and navigation is very user friendly. After you sign on
with your Yahoo! user name and password, you can get the same person-
alized content as you would on your PC.
This site should definitely be bookmarked.
 Con: Ironically, Yahoo! does not have a mobile version of its search
engine.
PliNkIT!
http://home.comcast.net/~plinkit
This site is an example of a Web portal that contains links to other sites.
 Pro: This site, which is organized into appropriate categories with a
variety of links, contains great mobile links for a variety of categories. It
is worth bookmarking.
 Con: At the time of writing, there were a couple of broken links, but
nothing major.
MSN Mobile
http://mobile.msn.com
The MSN Mobile portal is very similar to the Yahoo! Mobile site. As a
BlackBerry user, you can access MSN Hotmail, MSN Messenger, and an 
online calendar.
 Pro: Unlike Yahoo!, MSN does provide a local search, which you can use
to search for lodging/food/movie theaters near a location that you pro-
vide. This definitely can come in handy when you are on the go.
 Con: Unfortunately, MSN has annoying pictures and commercial banners
