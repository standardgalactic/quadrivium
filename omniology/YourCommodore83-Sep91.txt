GOING FOR GOLD
After three years in US Gold's garage,
Outrun Europa has ﬁnally made it onto the
road and I thought the AA were quite
efﬁcient nowadays! What a ride it
promises to be though.
It's a seven stage race across Europe in
a Porsche 911 (red, of course) or a Ferrari
F40, avoiding foreign police and European
terrorists, in an attempt to retrieve secret
ﬁles. Sounds like a hoot doesn't it — apart
from the water problem (no, not wanting to
go to the loo abroad but crossing things
like channels - well those wonderful
Brummies have invented a Turbo charged
Power Boat, so no worries.
Watch out for the full game in September
but don't blink or you'll miss it speed past.
PEOPLE DO THE
SPACKIEST
THINGS!
Codemasters certainly know which way their business is going
or are they just getting a bit dizzy!

K i r i (  OUT OF
YOU
Time to get your shoes and socks off and
your ﬁsts oot for the lads as we peek at US
Gold's Final Fight.
Unless you've been on the Planet Zod for
the last ﬁve years, you'll kn o w that Final
Fight is the sequel to none other that Street
Fighter, that kick-'em-up where you come
face-to-face (or foot-to-foot rather) With
some of the meanest punks on the streets.
The sequel is not that different. You play
Haggar (e x-S t re e t t ig h t e r n o t  c a rt o o n
viking), n o w Ma y o r of th e  city, wh o se
delectable daughter Jessica goes and gets
herself kidnapped by the brutal Mad Gear
Gang - obviously a set-up by Capcom to
make the sequel methinks!
Anyway it looks to be a good old ﬁsts,
feet and knives spectacular if you like that
kind o f  th in g  wit h  co lo u rf u l a n d  h u g e
sprites. You can bet thought that it won't
be The Final Fight - even the Last Ninja
survived 3 ﬁghts.

conversion is now imminent, coo! The game
promises to have three large arcade sections,
all of which are based around other genres.
Firstly, there's a Golden Axe-style stroll 'n'
scroll-em-up, where you (and a mate, if you
can ﬁn d  o n e ) wa lk  a lo n g  a  h o rizo n t a lly
scrolling landscape wasting any blob that
comes from outer space (Milton Keynes?) -
they co u ld  b e  shaped like  a n yth in g  to o ;
chairs, tables, Dan Quayle and other planks of
wood.
Then th e re 's an Operation Wo lf  section
where you, guess what? Blo w away some
more alien squids! A n d ,  ﬁnally, a shoot-'em-
up, forced-scroll section as you run at break-
neck pace towards the end-of-level meanie.
Er, and that's it really!

THE DREAM TEAM
W e  like to actively
stimulate the YC
editorial staff's
imagination, so we
asked them what
their favourite
vegetable matter
was and to do and
impression of it, as
best they could
with out resorting
to physical
violence.
Jeff "Navigator"
Davy
"I like mangos" chirped the
excited editor. "They're really
Juicy and they taste so nice. I
think a close second place has
to be the common or garden
potato. They are just so
versatile! You can mash them,
bake them, fry them or even
distil them and make a rather
powerful alcoholic beverage".
"As for my impression, I'll
go for the mango. Here it is....."
(Curls up in a rather odd
shape and lies motionless for
two minutes)
"Hey wow, I really know
how it feels to be a mango!"
Thanks Jeff, 6 out of ten.
Who are these people? Where do they come from?
Jason
"Medallion
Man" Miller
Jason, being the patriot
he is, opted for the Seville
orange.
"Call me old
fashioned", he says, "but
the plain old orange is still
my fave rave when it
comes to munching fruit."
"Listen," he shouted
defensively, "you can do
all sorts of things with
them_ You can squeeze
them, cut them into rings
and put them on the side
of your drinks, and
and
His rather modest
impersonation consisted of
sitting on the ﬂoor and painting
his face. As it desperate to
prove a point, he even
placed a piece of green
paper on his head.
This lasted for about a
minute, before he told us
to stuff our fruit where the
sun don't shine and
stormed out shouting
about how oranges will
always exist.
Boo! 2 out of ten!
Richard "Er,
I'll do it"
Taylor
"Oh, bananas deﬁnitely!",
exclaimed Richard. "They're
like, really good for
you and can help
reduce your
cholestorol level if
taken in excess.
Really high in ﬁbre
and sodium you could
practically live on
them. In fact, certain
tribes in rainforests in
South America have
been known to exist
purely on bananas
and avacados (a close
second, by the way)
and rarely experience
health problems. So
there you go!"
Er, thanks Richard.
His over-the-top
impression consisted
of lying on the ﬂoor,
covered in a blanket which he
F E M L I R E
proceeded to peel off.
"Oh no!" he screamed, "Oh
my God no! Please don't peel
me! AARRRGGGH! In the name
of things holy please don't eat
me!!!"
This rather disturbing
display lasted for about two
minutes and emptied the
ofﬁces completely.
Bopp! 0 out of ten!
Rik "Monster
Munch"
Henderson
YC's group editor looked a little
taken aback when asked this
question.
"Do pickled onion hula
hoops count?" he enquired.
"What about choc trios? I
know! Coca Cola contains
vegetable extracts. It says so
on the tin. So therefore my
favourite vegetable is coca
cola!" Er, OK Rik. Do you think
you could impersonate one,
He looked a liftled confused
at this concept,
"How about if I stand here
and make ﬁzzing noises for a
few minutes? I could paint
white and red stripes down my
side if that would help
Oh dear, wrong end of the
stick completely Rik.
Gout of ten.

FOOTBALL MANAGER
Programmer: Kevin Toms!
Type: Strategy game
Controls: Keyboard
If you don't remember this
game or have never played it
before, then here a few brief
instructions.
The idea is to take your
football team from the
bottom of division four to the
top of division one, winning
the FA cup as many times as
possible on the way. Sounds
easy!
You can buy and sell
players, you have a limited
budget so don't over spend
and remember you have to
pay them as well.
There are plenty of
options, all obviously named
in the game. They are easy to
access so the play is very
straightforward. I think the
best advice I can give on this
is to just load it and try
playing!
GOLOTRAIN
Programmers: David
Shepherd and Dominic Taylor
with just a tweeny bit of help
from Richard Taylor.
Type: Arcade game
Controls: Joystick only
The year is er, 1840ish I
suppose, and the Californian
gold rush is at it's peak.
Tremendous amounts of
gold are being transported
across America to major
cities and ports.
With all this gold moving
around, theres bound to be a
few banditos waiting to
pounce and strike it rich by
robbing one of the Gold
Trains. That's what the US

government thinks, which is
why they have grouped
together a team of worthy,
lawful cavalry types to escort
them.
This is where you come
in. You must protect the train
from bandits, Indians and
anything else that threatens
the train in some way. If you
successfully reach your
destination town (Chicago)
then you could become very
rich indeed...
HOW TO PLAY
You control the horseman
with the joystick. Controls
are; (with no ﬁre) move in
normal directions, ﬁre and
back to jump, ﬁre and
forward diagonals to shoot
and ﬁre and left or right to
jump left or right.
Forward and back with no
ﬁre will accelerate and slow
the horse.
Best idea is to build up
full speed, and run ahead of
the train.
If you reach a station (for
energy re-charge and pick up
extra gold) before the train,
don't worry. It will pull up in
it's own time. It's never really
that far behind you.

TANK BATTLEZONE
There was a slight problem
with the duplication so er,
here it is in all it's full
hitech glory! Hurrah!
Programmer: Andrew Boxall
Type: Complete game -
arcade action
Controls: Joystick in port 1
and port 2 for two player
game.
It was decided, one day
during World War II, that a
special crack squad should
be sent behind enemy lines
to try and take out a rather
large munitions factory. A
squad was scrambled which
consisted of a tank and
helicopter, it was named the
"battlezone" squad.
They had to travel across
a large, heavily-defended
land, but it was hoped (due to
the smallness of the
squadron), that they could
pass un-noticed.
If they had to destroy

HOW TO PLAY
Two players can play
simultaneously, one
controlling the tank and the
other the helicopter. A
joystick in each port is
needed, although one player
can play with joystick in
either port.
The idea is simple, shoot
all the defences and try to
make as much progress as
possible.
The tank can only drive on
the roads, but the helicopter

then they could work
well together b e in g  on

This seemed like an
impossible task, and if they

be hailed as heroes.

THE RETURN O. VIRTUAL REALITY
ts)
F E A T U R E
Still wearing his YG 'cut-out-and-
keep' Virtual Reality headset, J e f f
Da v y  st u mb led  d o wn  to London's
Rock Ga rd e n  an d  T ro cad ero  to
lose h imself in s o me  mo re  virtual
worlds.
L
ast time we saw Virtual
Reality (and, please,
can we just call it 'VA'
from now on, please?) it was
sorts peer into an enclosure
full of journalists and other
degenerates.
The centrepieces are two
in the massive surroundings
of Wembley Conference
Centre - which was full of
Press people, the rest of the
world, and their dog. W
Industries were showing off
their sit-down VA arcade
machines which offered V-
TOL, a harrier sim, and
Battlesphere, a space action
game.
It's all a bit more intimate
this time - outside the Rock
Garden, a restaurant and
famous gig venue in
London's Covent Garden.
Tourists and other curious
podiums. Both have a
person on them, a
person with a VR
headset. Each is
clutching a joystick, on
the end of a shower-
pipe-style metal cable
which leads to a small
waist-pack, and is
moving their head
around in a very strange
fashion indeed, as if
watching a troupe of
performing, slow-motion,
high-jumping rabbits.
Next to each podium
(which are a good 12
feet away from each
other) is a monitor, on

F E A k T
1
1
which can be seen what the
bod in the headset can see.
This turns out to be
Nightmare, a new VR game
(or "experience", as the
Press Release would prefer
me to call it) which involves
neither planes nor
spaceships but walking
around and shooting things.
But there are no ordinary
things to shoot.
Nightmare has -
apart from
swooping, green.
ﬁre-breathing
pterodactyls who'll
tear you to shreds if
you let them get to
close - the best kind
of opponent of all. A
real, live, human
opponent. Those
two podiums are
linked and it's duel-
to-the death time.
Nightmare takes
place in a 3D
(match!) battle arena,
made up of blocks,
steps, platforms,
lifts and columns,
and which appears
to be suspended in
the middle of space
- you can see the
stars. As you move
your head, so the
view follows. If you
press the top button
on the joystick, you
'walk' forward. The
other button ﬁres
your grenade/rocket
pistol.
The two players arrive in
the arena simultaneously,
and have two minutes (that's
what you pay for, time not
lives) to ﬁnd and kill each
other as many times as
possible.
It's pretty good too. The
fact that there's a human
opponent makes it even
better.
It'll open to the public at
the Rock Garden from now
on, too.
The action moves to the
Trocadero, down the road at
LICE B
Piccadilly Circus.
In the midst of the Troc's
tourist-trappery lies the Fun
Land arcade, which was one
of the ﬁrst places to install
the original V-TOL and
Battlesphere VR units. Now
they've got a new attraction:
Total Destruction.
Whilst this may sound like
it involves smashing the
1 EVE"
say. Continental
Circus and its ilk.
The race
starts and, well,
you just have to
race around
(keeping on the
track and guided
by massive red
and yellow-
ﬂashing arrows)
the track, trying
not to incur too
much damage
and bumping into
other racers,
whilst everyone else does the
same and piles into you.
It has a very loud
soundtrack to go with it, in
which a voice that sounds
just like Steve Martin shouts
"To-taaaal
Deeestructionnnn"
throughout.
The game lasts until
someone wins, not until you
ﬁnish and costs two quid per
race. A bit, er, pricey, really.
But fun.
whole place up before the
security guards drag you
away, kicking and screaming,
it's actually a stock-car
racing game.
Those sit-down units are
back. This time with a hinged
front that clicks down over
your legs, two pedals
(accelerator and brake), a
two-position gear stick
(forward and reverse) and a
steering wheel, as well as the
ever-present headset.
Four units (ranged two
opposite each other) are
linked together in this 3D
race game, which is more in
the style of Hard Drivin' than,
VR moves onwards and, whilst these may
not be the best things since sliced bread,
they are still a good taste of the future.
What ever could be next?

has sent in a rather superb
map and pokes for YC's
excellent cover game,
Wizards Lair.
Thanks B, or can I call
you EU? 10 quid is coming
your way very soon!
The pokes to go with this
are:
POKE 49623,165
for inﬁnite lives
POKE 49721,x
for extra keys, rings and
diamonds. X is for how
many of each you require.

To start the game again,
type:

Unfortunately, when you
reset the game (which you
will have to do to enter the
pokes in the ﬁrst place),
some data corrupts and
renders some of the rooms
inaccessible. This should
not happen if you are using
a cartridge such as Action

will if you just normally reset

Now for some Speedball II
tips from our very own ofﬁce
banana picker, Richard
Taylor.
When you head up the ﬁeld
when the game ﬁrst starts
(or after a goal has been
scored ), run straight
towards the ball and just
before you reach it, pull the
joystick up and right and

keep pressing ﬁre. If it
works, the ball should hit the
electriﬁer and bounce back
into the goal passing
straight through the keeper.
It may need to be hit again,
but your winger should be
right next to the ball anyway.
It takes a bit of practice, but
when you have sussed it, it
means you can score goals
very quickly (ﬁve seconds,

usually).
Another piece of advice
is to forget going for score
enhancers (the twirly bits on
the side) and just try to keep
the opponenets away from
them. They always go for
them and seem to end up
getting both even if you're
trying to get them yourself!
It is also worth saving
your money for a bit and

WINGERS CORNER
Loads of people winge all the time. Why? Various reasons... some people do it out of
boredom and some have geniune reason. Some people are not happy with their lives and
some do it through greed. In this column however, people are not happy with the way
they play their computer games and need some help to improve their play. Heavy
problems, huh?
If you feel the same way about a certain game, send a letter to "WINGERS CORNER"
at the normal YC address. If you can help these people, send advice to the same place.
Mark Goodley of Newcastle requires some assistance on Skull and Crossbones and
would really appreciate a cheat mode and a poke to remove the a ll enemies must die to
advance to the next level" feature. What a good feature that is.
Emma Copeman, your Frosty help is ﬁnally on it's way! A poke to remove various nestles
(including the famous "drunk Elf") will appear in next issue. Sorry about the delay, we beat
Richard Taylor around the head several times to make him do it, but unforunately we beat
him so hard he's having to spend a few weeks in hospital.
Bill Schultz needs help on the all-time 64 classic, RED L.E.D. A poke for unlimited lives
would really go down a treat.
Remember Confuzion? Well Barnaby Tanker in Norwich needs a cheat badly. Well Barney,
if I remember rightly, type LOAD —
second level accessible.
Tommy Boner, who lives in Cheadle HuIme, needs some help with International Soccer.
OK Tommy, when you start the game, run in the direction you are facing and kick the ball
into the back of the ﬁrst net you see. This should give you an advantage over your
opponent. Keep doing this until the ﬁnal whistle blows. (That's enough joking about, Ed.)
Can you poke? Well what are you waiting foil Hack away at the latest and requested
games and sort out some serious cheats! Major prizes await those with the best and most
original pokes. Come on you hacking crews, get to it!
A reminder that POKE entry information was given in the July issue of YC. Please refer
to this for instructions.

Thanks, Rik. You get 10 pounds for that.
A cheat for the old
Interceptor game, Aquanaut.
When playing the game, hold
down the Commodore key,
shift and the pound sign.
Keep doing this until your
sub dissappears, and you can
now travel anywhere.
On the subject of
Interceptor games, on Trollie

SOME ADVICE
ON CHEATING
ON GAMES
If you own a utility
cartridge i.e. Action
Replay, Expert, Final,
etc that posseses a
machine code monitor,
then you are able to
cheat on most games.
Here is some advice on
removing enemy
collisions.
Some games use
the standard hardware
'sprite to sprite'
detection. To remove
this, ﬁrst enter the
monitor as explained in
the cartridge manual.
After that, type:
H 0000 FFFF lE DO
This searches the
memory for reference to
sprite collisions. If any
numbers are printed
after pressing return, i.e.
10F6 or what ever, then
type:
D 10F5
Always use one byte
previous to the printed
number. When it lists,
press run stop. If it
reads LDA SDO1E, or
LDY or even LOX, then
you are on the right
track. Now change this
to read; LDA#S00
followed by NOP.
Enter this by moving
the cursor up to the
statement in question
and typing over it. Press
return after each entry.
Now return to the
game as speciﬁed by
the cartridge
insructions. If all has
worked, sprite collisions
should now be
removed.
If you want to
change it to background
collisions, then change
the lE to 1F.
The sprite/sprite
collisions should work
on games such as
Manic Miner, Frosty the
Snowman, and loads of
others.
The
Sprite/background
collisions should work
on Armalyte, Fortress,
Dip Diver and again on
loads of other games.
Try it and ﬁnd out which
ones work.

Co d e  M a s t e rs  are no lo n g er just b o y

suspected, into the mo s t  successful
so ftware h o u se in Britain. J e f f  D a v y

W
verge of being
the biggest
thing around here," laughs
Code Masters' PR supremo
Mike Clark, as we speed
down small Warwickshire
lanes in his rather powerful
sports car, "who else has 98
acres? We must be the
biggest software company in
Britain!"
That's slightly misleading,
and he knows it, but when we
glide up the gravel drive of
the Codies' HQ it's easy to
believe he could be right. A
basic farmhouse, surrounded
by beavering builders, now
has a maze of extensions
added to it. The ultra-new
complex is a far cry from the
huddle of portakabins
stashed around the rear that
made do as ofﬁces last time
YC paid a visit.
Out the back, there's a
lake - in it is a boat made by
Richard Darling and a friend.
Mike insisted on rowing me
around in it. I t  won't sink"
promises Mike, as he sways
the craft from side to side
and snags the oar on
branches and rushes.
To one side of the
farmhouse is a wall, a
massive barn lies behind,
from which there are
occasional mooing sounds.
Says Mike, as another 'moo'
ﬁlls the air, "They're involved
in breeding cows, I'll leave
the rest to your imagination.
We do get some awfully
strange noises coming over!"
Inside, the ofﬁces are a
hive of activity. Over 30
people are on the payroll;
accounts people,
programmers, executives...
the latter are stashed on the
new 'executive ﬂoor' (well, an
upstairs bit, anyhow) where
Mike and the Darlings have
their ofﬁces.
Code Masters now sell
more games than any other
software house in Britain. For
what it's worth, they have
over 20% of the market
(according to Gallup, whose
business it is to know these
things). Their next rival isn't
even close. "We rule the 8-bit
roost." says Mike, before
joking: "We're so good at the
software industry, the
challenge is diminishing week
by week!".
"Don't print that!" he
adds, suddenly seeing me
scribble his every word into
my notebook.
The Code Masters/Darling
story is one of a meteoric
rise. David and Richard
Darling were young, talented,
programmers who... but don't

have me explain. Have it in
Richard Darling's own words:
"Around 1982, David and I
were about 13, him being 18
months older than me, and
our parents lived in Canada. I
think they wanted to make
sure, although they weren't
with us, that we got nice
presents. One Christmas a
cheque arrived, so we went
to London and bought a VIC-
20 [the computer before the
C64].
"They were launched in
the US a year before Britain
and before we left Canada, a
friend of ours bought one and
we spent a lot of time around
it.
"I'd always like
electronics and it seemed
absolutely amazing to
produce something with a
soldering iron. With very little
effort, you could make a
machine do things.
"Once we bought the
computer, we used to write
games for it, 'cos there

weren't any available. We
started to place ads in
Popular Computing Weekly
[an old computer magazine],
under the name 'Galactic
Software' and we offered the
'Vic 6-pack'. It did fairly well.

"When I was in Taipei
[in Taiwan], where we
were having some
cartridges
manufactured, we
went out to a long
street with market
stalls. It was only six
feet wide. There were
shops that sell live snakes' blood as a beverage.
"The Chinese seem to think that drinking the blood of
snakes is very medicinal.
-
slit their throat, tip them up, get a jar, and pour the blood
into it.
"The speciality is one of the organs from the snake, a
little grey thing, and they add this green stuff from inside
this organ. People pay a lot of money for that."
there was the LET Show [the
show before September's
annual CES at Earls Court]
and we had a stand. We met
up with several computer
companies including
Mastertronic [the ﬁrst budget
games company] and got
contracts to produce games
for the C64 for them.
"Pretty soon it became
apparent that Mastertronic
was going to go places. We
moved to London and formed
Alp. We produced all the
software they sold, in April
1984.
"It was very successful
but it was heading in a
different direction to us. We
wanted to concentrate on
producing original software,
so we settled up with them
and started our own
company.

ready to launch. The
philosophy was to release
original games over all
formats.
"In September 1986 we
launched and it all went very
well. We followed up with
another batch of 12 games.
The ﬂagship was BMX
Simulator which was the
bestseller.

selling game the year before
with The Last V8 so we were
happy and busy producing
these games on a small
industrial estate in Banbury.

As I leave, with Mike, for the
day I ask Richard why, as a
teenager, he chose to
program computers. "I didn't
like skateboards" he laughs.
"No," says Mike, with a
mischievous grin, ever the
good PR-person, "it was a
prediction of future trends!"
Whichever, they're
number one and they're
riding high.
A 'Spyhunter-style game, which is intended to be really
fast. You drive your mean machine up the road, avoiding
obstacles (like
holes) and other
cars, which try to
smash you
around and make
you crash.
To make it a
little more
interesting, you
can pick up
various weapons
to help you on
your way and
drop oil behind
your car to get other vehicles.
MIAMI CHASE
Amiga-owners have already seen this one. It sounds
distinctly like it ought to have something to do with well-
dressed TV cops but, er, Code
Masters' legal department wouldn't
like to be involved with well-paid,
sun-tanned American lawyers so
we'll just pretend it's a
coincidence, right?
The action takes place in a
maze of urban streets, which even
includes a raised train-line
(although you can't give chase
underneath it, like in 'French
Connection'), and your mission is
to catch a criminal by, um, racing
around like a mad-person.
A simple idea, quite nicely executed, which should
provide a good challenge.
SKY HIGH STUNTMAN
Hands up who likes vertically-scrolling shoot-'em-ups...
Right, a good few of you, then. Well, this'll be to your taste.
You play (rather
tenuously) a
stuntman who
must ﬂy a balloon,
biplane, jet and
helicopter - all in
the name of good,
big-screen action.
It's nicely
presented and,
says Paul, "the
musics really
brilliant!". But then
he would say that,
wouldn't he?!
SLIGHTLY MAGIC
This is a game in the Dizzy/puzzle/objects/tasks mould
involving a trainee wizard called, yup, you've guessed it,
Slightly Magic. By trundling around the wizard's creepy
castle (full of bouncing meanies and ghosties), manipulating
(there's a long word!) the objects you ﬁnd along the way,
you can complete the game and become a better wizard.

AWAY THEN?
Thanks to those brill Codies we've got four Game Gears
(the wonderful new hand-held console thingmies) to give to
four winners (can you see a trend starting here?).
Plus! Each of the four winners receives four different
Codemasters Ouattro packs (it's pretty obvious!) - Cartoon,
Racers, Firepower, and Arcade.
Not only that but four runners-up get the Ouattro packs
too (that's right there's a rather clever trend involved here
around the number four, isn't there? Ooo... We're so subtle
sometimes)!

WHAT A
LONG ONE!!
I've decided to take up
Thomas Bowen's stance by
writing to put you straight
as to why YC is falling to
bits (what? Are the staples
falling out? - PA).
I buy three Commodore
related mags, and I'm
afraid that YC Is lagging
way behind the other two.
They are both cra mme d
full of stuff, and wh a t do
you offer? A photo story!
Not much of a sales
booster.
Okay, enough moans.
First of all, get the price
right (er, I thought you said
"enough moans"! - PA). It
should be E2.20 like the
other two, wh ich  would
help cover the cost of a
tape box. This is a help
when deciding wh ich  mag
to buy. If it looks as though
money has been spent on
production, the kids love it.
Plus, something that all
the mags that have tapes
should do, is put games
info on one page, either
side, so it can be removed
and be more handy when
you are playing the
freebies.
Don't spread the free
tape details over the
pages, get it on one page
and it  would save time
wasted on searching for
playing instructions. I also
agree with Tom about
more demos, I'd like two
games and possibly two
demos.
Okay, to keep in line
with other letters here's
some questions:
1. Could you give us any
more info on the C65, or
haven't you lot heard about
this yet? The most
important thing I want to
know is, will everything
I've bought so far games-
wise  be playable on the
new C65 - I'd hate to buy it
all again?
2. What's been the
highest rated game so far
in VC?
3. What's been the
lowest?
4. Have you got a copy
of Shadow of the Beast
around that no-one wants?
5. And can I have it?
Well, that's that. I hope
you'll take on-board my
suggestions - I'd like to
see VC out-sell those
poncy other C64 mags, as
you chaps have a bit of fun
in your mag (a bit of
grovelling here methinks! -
PA), and I'd like that game
I mentioned (I kn e w it! -
PA).
Yohan, Lanarkshire
PS. Bevy Babes
centrespread please,
playboy page three style,
thanks!
PA: Firstly, it's that old E2.20
debate again (sigh!). I do not
think that two scruffy pieces
of plastic are worth 25p, and
anyway the worst injury you
can cause someone to have
with them is a small blind
man's pinch on the ﬁnger,
and what use is that in
combat?
What we'd like to
concentrate on is bloody
good games on the tape, and
forget about its packaging.
And like you said, YC is the
only commie mag with a bit
of fun.
As for your questions:
1. I tried ringing
Commodore to ask about the
C65 and this is what I got?
Phone: Bring!
CBM: Hello?
Me: Hello, I'm Post
Apocalypse, and I'd like to
know about the C65, please!
CBM: Hello?
Me: I'm POST
APOCALYPSE, and I'd like to
know about the C65!
CBM: Hello?
Me: WHAT ABOUT THE
* V  °Mg  °/0 C65?
CBM: Hello?
Me: OH SOD IT! Click...
Later I found out that I
had taken too many hayfever
tablets and I was in fact
talking to a banana and not a
telephone at all.
Unfortunately, a small
yellow curved fruit doesn't
know an awful lot about
home computer
entertainment... It told me
how to lag a hot water pipe
though!
2. The highest rated game
was Last Ninja 3, when Rik
had a bit of a funny turn and
gave it 100%!
3. The lowest rated was
Kenny Dalglish Soccer Match
which got a n d  that was
when Rik was feeling a bit
generous (let's just say that
he thought he'd stepped in
'some doggie doo)!
4. No!
5. It depends what you
want? When somebody says
"can I have it?" to me, they
normally end up in the local
inﬁrmary!
As for a Bevy Babes
poster, it'd be a bit out of the
question really. Mainly
because if we did that, we'd
also have to print a poster of
Rik or Jeff in the nuddie, so
that we're not deemed sexist,
and that'd be a thought far
too hideous to contemplate,
sorry!
SIX OF ONE...
Please answer the
questions I have to ask:
1. Is Golden Axe any
good or what?
2. Could you give me
the cheat for Robocop,
because on level four -
where you climb steps - I
can't get past it?
3. Is piracy really such a
bad thing?
4. I have heard there
will be a new computer out
soon, named C65, is this
true?
5. Is Snow Bros
available for the C64?
6. In the game Escape,
how do you get the gun?
Where is the key? And the
BORED IN SCHOOL
I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do 'cause me
dumb parents had to go and send me to boarding school.
Now I can't buy YC mags because I can't ﬁnd them anywhere down here (The

months before it comes out in the Aussie shops) for payment for wrecking your printer! b)
Run away from boarding school, and hide in bushes for the rest of your life, only coming
out to beg for money and buy your YC in the local paper shop! Or c) Get new parents!
I'd personally advise trying 'a' as the best option!

game.
The idea is simple
enough. You take control of a
team of, to say the least,
rough looking people in an
attempt to work your way up
through two divisions of
Speedball league.
You can alter an
individual's strength and
play-power through a series
of statistics including throw
power, stamina, speed etc.
These can be bought only, so
with your limited cash you
must spread your spending
evenly as possible across the
individuals stats.
There is an option to
modify these as group
(defence, midﬁeld and attack)
or as a whole team. Other
players can be bought, but
these are quite expensive
and you need to save for a
while to afford them.
Once you have initially
modiﬁed your team, then you
can start play. You take
control of Brutal Deluxe, a
poor and fairly weak team at
the bottom of the second
division. You must play other
teams such as the notorious
Steel Fury and Damocles and
the very poo-er Revolvers.
When the play begins,
you are the red team. It is set
out in similar fashion to K ic
Off, with a vertically scrolling
screen with goals at either
end. The player under your
control is the one with a semi
circle over his head. Once
play starts, time for violence!
A good idea is to pass the
ball as much as possible and
try to punch out the
opponents players! There are
bonus "twirly bits" on the
side of the play area, which if
activated will double your
score when a goal is scored.
There are also plenty of
bonus stat items lying around
the play ﬁeld and coins which

are essential so you can buy
things after the match. Bonus
items also include speed,
which really does speed the
play up something awful,
paralysis which freezes your
opponent (or you if they pick
it up!), invulnerability which
renders you immune to
tackles, or plenty of others.
All of these can be picked
up by the other team, so be
careful and make sure you
get them ﬁrst.
On the side of the pitch is
a small button which will
electrify the ball, meaning
that only your team can pick
it up and knocks your
opponents for six! Very
amusing sometimes,
especially when the ball goes
straight through their goal
keeper!
There are pockets on the
side which the ball can be
thrown into, for a bonus two
points for your score. Ten
points are awarded for a
normal goal, or ﬁfteen or
twenty depending on whether
you have activated the "twirly
bits".
I never really bothered
with these, as the other team
seems completely obsessed
with getting them, and
whenever I did they seemed
to put them back pretty damn
quick!
If you ﬁnd yourself losing
drastically, then just go for
picking things up. Some
teams just seem to be quite
uncatchable when they have
a large lead.
After the match, you have

loads of options at your
disposal. After you are
presented with the other
team's scores, you can save
the game if you feel it
worthwhile, train the team
(buy stats) buy players and
various other things.
I found a good idea was to
save a bit of money up and
buy star players, as they
always seemed to be a lot
better than your own. If you
do buy, then a player of your
own must be sold. His value
is taken off the price of the
player you want. Forwards are
a good thing to go for. I
became quite attached to a
certain "Arnold", my centre
forward, who seemed to be at
one point the only player
capable of scoring goals! It is
worth building up one player
more than others, normally
the centre forward, as their
value goes up and they
become someone to relate to
in the team!
There are other play
options such as two player,
one player league, one player
cup, manager and knockout.
The only good feature missing
from the Amiga version is the
ability to save and replay
classic goals! Shame really,
some can be very satisfying
to watch again.
The graphics at ﬁrst look
not really very good, but they
ﬁt the game very well and
once you learn what's what,
then they are quite clear. The
graphics on the option
screen, although slightly slow,
are really good. I particularly
liked the Amiga-style icon
system for selections.
The sound is not too
impressive, really, but suits
the game and, once
understood, helps you to get
into the game more.
Overall, I recommend any
one has a look at this, even if
like me, you don't like this
kind of game. It really is
bloody addictive stuff.
Designed by the Bitmap
Brothers, you can't really fault
it in any design feature. Very
carefully worked out and
tested, it adds up to a brilliant
game. We want more Bitmap
conversions on the 64! Gods
would really be appreciated. If
it needs converting and any
Bit brother is reading this,
look no further! (Oi - this isn't
a job centre! Ed.)

Go and buy this game,
I promise you'll love it!

I
6 6 ' l l  be back" said Arnold
Schwarzenegger in the
1984 smash hit
science ﬁction movie THE
TERMINATOR (and almost
every other Arnie ﬁlm since).
Well, it's taken seven years,
but he's back all right - with a
vengeance.
Even before the movie's
July 3 US opening, the buzz
surrounding the budget-
busting sequel,
TERMINATOR 2: Judgment
Day, had reached ear-
splitting level. And now, well
over a month into the 8125
million movie's U.S. release,
shockwaves are still being
felt across the world as the
latest stage of Arnie's world
takeover bid kicks in.
The original
TERMINATOR movie told the
chilling story of a cyborg
from the future (played by
Arnie) sent back in time to kill
the innocent and
unsuspecting Sarah Connor
(played by Linda Hamilton,
later to star as on half of TV's
Beauty and the Beast) before
she could give birth to a son
who would one day lead the
human resistance against the
deadly self-willed machines
of the future.
The cyborg failed its
mission.
Now, in TERMINATOR 2:
Judgment Day, a new and
deadlier cyborg, the T-1000
(played with expressionless
charm by Robert Patrick), has
been sent back to strike at
Sarah's son, John Connor
(promising newcomer
Edward Furlong), while he is
still a child. This time,
however, Sarah (Hamilton
again) and John don't face
the terrifying and relentless
machine alone - to protect
the young boy, the human
resistance has sent another
Terminator from the future, a
T-800 model
(Schwarzenegger)
programmed to be as
implacable in its defence of
John as its cyborg foe is in its
pursuit of him.
First Sarah must be
'sprung' from the mental
hospital where she has spent
the years since the ﬁrst
Terminator's attack, and
meanwhile there's World War
Three (the 'Judgment Day' of
the (sub)title) to be averted...
Director James Cameron
(who directed the original
TERMINATOR as well as
ALIENS and THE ABYSS)
says that the decision to
make a sequel to THE
TERMINATOR was not
arrived at alone.
"Arnold was always a very
strong force in trying to get
the sequel made," he says. "I
realised that THE
TERMINATOR was the one
ﬁlm I'd done that was closest
to my heart and that I'd really
enjoyed making just for the
sheer kinetic thrill of
ﬁlmmaking. So with
TERMINATOR 2 I've come full
circle."
The main man,
Schwarzenegger himself
(who turned down
PREDATOR 210 rejoin
Cameron for T2), agrees.
"Everything about the ﬁrst
TERMINATOR lent itself to a
sequel," he says. "Right after
we wrapped the ﬁrst one I
told Jim that we needed to
continue this story."
Since audiences of the
ﬁrst ﬁlm identiﬁed more with
Arnie's death-dealing

S P E S H

•
quipster than Linda
Hamilton's putative heroine, it
was important to
Schwarzenegger that, for the
sequel, he'd play the hero.
"In the ﬁrst ﬁlm," he says,
"everything I did, they just
screamed and loved it, you
know, like I was the hero!"
Soon Cameron and co-
screenwriter William Wisher
had come up with a
satisfactory script, and
TERMINATOR 2 was
underway.
The road back to the
screen was no easy ride,
however. The sequel's
producers, Caro!co, had to
'buy oft" the owners of the
TERMINATOR rights
(Hemdale Film and Gale Ann
Hurd, Cameron's ex-wife), ﬁx
fees for Arnie ($15 million),
the director ($5 million) and
returning co-star Linda
B I G  T H R I L L S  S P E S H
Hamilton ($1 million) and get
a script together (another Si
million or so). Before
Cameron had shot a single
inch of ﬁlm, Caro!co had
spent nearly $30 million.
It was small wonder that
TERMINATOR 2: Judgment
Day would go on to become,
at close to S125 million, the
most expensive movie of all
time. And, while this may be
good news for genre fans
eager to see exciting new
products every summer, it's
bad news for 99.9% of ﬁlm
makers, the ones who want
studios to spend only a few
million dollars on their
movies.
Before TERMINATOR 2:
Judgment Day's astonishing
US opening, one Hollywood
analyst said, "A scenario
scarier than [if 12 is] a major
ﬂop - which we've all seen
before - would be if [it] is a
success. This would prompt
people to think, 'Gee, it's OK
to work with massive
budgets'. It would be
healthier for everybody if T2
bombs badly."
Healthier for everybody
except Carole°, whose early
success - crowned by
RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART
II - has soured, with
expensive failures such as
AIR AMERICA and MUSIC
BOX. They have, in fact,
spent about $320m over
income since 1986, and their
debts leapt from $1 .2m to
more than $305m before T2
opened.
But however much money
they spend on the ﬁlm (and
believe me, every dollar is on
the screen), the price of
admission stays the same,
and therefore T2 has to be
one of the best value-for-
money pictures of all time -
right up there with STAR
WARS, DIE HARD and THE
ABYSS.
It's a long ﬁlm (a good bit
over two hours), and the
special effects (
edge of what's possible"
according to Cameron) in the
movie's many set-pieces are
genuinely unprecedented.
It's a chase movie, almost
a remake of THE
TERMINATOR, with a
generous helping of ALIENS
(particularly in the
development of Sarah
Connor as a kind of Ripley-
on-acid, and the ﬁnale's
ALIENS-reminiscent set).
But the way it's pulling in
money all over the world
($115 million in three weeks
in the U.S. alone), it's quite
likely to end up the highest-
grossing movie of all time.
And if that's bad news for
low-budget ﬁlm-makers, it's
good news for genre lovers
like you and me.
But although it's as
violent a movie as Arnie
devotees have come to
expect, it has a real '90s
conscience - as Cameron
puts it, "This ﬁlm says, 'You
like that action? You like that
violence? This person pays
the price," - and that's as
good a reason I know for
pushing back the cinematic
envelope.

en years later and Amie's back. But this time he's
not on a killing mission. He's a Terminator cyborg
reprogrammed and sent back to the 20th Century
to protect John Connor, son of Sarah Connor, the
Terminator's quarry in the original ﬁlm.
In the future, John Connor becomes the resistance's
leader. Humans ﬁght against the machine-might of
Skynet, a military defence project built in the late 1990's
by humans that went tenibly wrong. Skynet had, y'see,
triggered a huge nuclear war ('Judgement Day') in the
late 1990's which decimated the human population.
To get back to the early 90's, another Terminator has
been sent to eliminate John. And this isn't the metal-and-
skin of Arnie, but a revolutionary new make of Terminator
(I-1000), made of liquid metal. Every time something
happens to it, it just re-forms. And not just in one shape;
in any shape it feels like.
It can imitate people it has come into contact with,
tools, knives - quite a few rather nasty things, as it goes.
It's even more unstoppable than Arnie. Problem, huh?
Once the T-800 (Arnie) has found John, the ﬁlm
becomes an eternal chase, as the T-1000 (in the form of a
mean-looking cop) comes after them, and, later, them
and Sarah Connor, who boy and cyborg spring from a
mental asylum. It seems that no matter how much
ammunition (and, believe me, he gets through a lot) is
ﬁred at the T-1000 he just keeps corning...
The whole movie is an excellently-ﬁlmed, nicely-
soundtracked, real-action extravaganza, with a wealth of
special effects including the oozing, object-forming,
liquid-metal body of the T-1000 and the mass of
explosions, crashes... it's just great.
It keeps you going right up until the ﬁnale, with its
mixture of suspense and humour (like Arnie learning
Spanish street-slang, such as "Fiesta la vista, baby" and
the immortal "No
problemcr, which
surely threatens to
replace the immortal
"I'll be back" of
original).
Quite simply the
best ﬁlm this year.

ﬁlm stonking its way
to cinemas near
you, it's obviously (as sure as
the Pope is Catholic) got to
be 'seen the ﬁlm/read the
book/worn the hat/heard the
song... now play the game'
time.
And so it is, with Ocean's
cartridge-based (although it
will be bout on tape and disk
too) 'game of the T2 ﬁlm',
which takes sequence-slices
from the movie and turns
them into chunks of gamil
action.
Anyone who hasn't seen
B I G  T H R I L L S S
the ﬁlm yet should think
carefully before reading on,
the game follows the plot and
if you don't want to know
what happens... But, hell, you
probably all know already
(and if you don't, read the ﬁlm
review!) so let's crack on!
The ﬁrst chunk comes as
a ﬁght, between Arnie and
the T-1000, in the corridor of
the amusement arcade where
John Connor has been found.
As Arnie, you must pummel
your opponent with well-
placed ﬁsts and some frantic
headbutting. At this stage the
T-1000 is fairly easy to knock
out.
Next it's onto the chase,
well, one of many, anyway!
Arnie, having swiped John
from a small racing bike onto
the back of his Harley
Davidson motorbike (yeah!),
is being chased down a
large concrete storm drain
by the T-1000, who just
happens to be driving a
rather large truck.
The only way to get
out alive is to jump over
numerous puddles using
ramps provided and not to
crash into foliage or other
obstacles. Every time you do
something wrong, you take a
knock back. One knock too
many and you get splatted on
the front of the following
truck.
If you escape that, it's
operation time! Arnie's (robot)
arm needs some attention, a
bit of an operation, as it goes.
This takes the form of an
involving puzzle game in
which you get a view of
L

S  S P E S H
Amie's wrist and a row of
mixed-up metal joints to

B I G  T H R I L L S  S P E S H

:aAti
before
the end of a time limit. If you
succeed, full energy is
restored. Good, eh?
Sarah Connor has to be
helped to escape from a
mental asylum, next, and this
is a sort-of side-on maze
game with a warren of lifts
and corridors to negotiate
and a host of guards and
lackeys to avoid.
A few minutes later and
Arnie must stall for time (with
his gun, yeah!) while Sarah
and John escape in the lift.
This involves another killing
sesh with the T-1000.
Puzzle time again for the
following instalment. This
time it's a 'rearrange-the-
blocks'-style puzzle game.
The blocks make up Amie's
face and if you complete the
puzzle within the time limit,
" No  p ro b l e mo r said J e f f  Da v y ,  w h e n  a s k e d
to write an exclusive review of the T 2 g a me .
Everyo n e else though th e job mig h t  b e a 'ra w
deal ( T h a t 's  en o u g h  rubbish Arn ie Jokes!)
you get all your energy back!
The corridors make a
return as Arnie ﬁnds himself
shooting through waves of
SWAT team people to get
out of the Cyberdyne
Laboratories building.
This is more lifts
and lackeys-style
play. Let rip with
the pump-
action!
In the
penultimate
level, Arnie
is driving a
stolen
SWAT van
from the
Labs, as the
T-1000
follows in a
chopper. You
have to drive
the van, avoiding
anything that gets
in the way, whilst
Sarah shoots the
chopper from the back
until it crashes (or you
crash!).
The ﬁnal part takes place
in the.- well, see the ﬁlm. It's
a ﬁght sequence and even if
you drain all the 1-1000's
energy, you still have to
guess how to ﬁnish him off...
"Watch the ﬁlm, dudes" as
YC's ﬁlm-mole Dave Hughes
would say.
This clocks in as one of
the best 'game-of-the-ﬁlm'
adaptations on the CI34. The
action is fast and furious, it
moves fast, the comic-strip-
esque graphics ﬁt the game
very well and the sound is
consistent throughout.
There's been a whole lotta
attention to detail, too,
especially with the customary
between level screens which
explain the ongoing plot.
Get hold of this one. It's
almost as mean as Arnie!

THE
TERMINATOR:
SECONDARY
OBJECTIVES
#1 (of 4)
Dark Horse
Wow! What a right rousing
corker of blood, guts, metal
and bullets. What we don't
get in Secondary Objectives
part one - the sequel to
Tempest - is a moment's
break from the action that no
Termite could live without.
We ﬁnd that one of the droids
from Tempest has survived
and we essentially just get to
watch in on his furious
rampage through the cops of
L.A.
Its best features are
deﬁnitely the pace and the
artwork, but this is quite
honestly the best of all the
Terminator comics now being
released/re-released!

THE
TERMINATOR:
ONE SHOT
Dark Horse
This thin graphic novel has
far more contact to
Terminator - the movie,
mainly because it deals with
a Terminator that appeared in
America at the same time as
Arnie, only this one went after
the wrong Sarah Connor, and
is a female model of the
androids.
The comic itself has three
redeeming features; ﬁrstly,
it's drawn by Matt Wagner,
one of the most down-to-
earth and 'eye-friendly' artists
currently working in
comicdom (he's just drawn
the soon-to-be-released
Batman vs. Grendel for DC);
secondly, it has more action
than the Arnie ﬂick itself; and
thirdly, it has the most
innovative 3D pop-out
section ever seen in this
medium.
That's about it, it's not as
good as Tempest, but no
Termite (a Terminator fan)
can do without it.

THE
TERMINATOR:
TEMPEST
Dark Horse
This is a collection of the ﬁrst
series of Dark Horse
ofﬁcially-licenced comics that
do not rely on a movie
adaptation or any other such
pile of unholy crap.
It's totally based on the
'idea' behind the original
Terminator ﬁlm and does not
dwell on that movie plot as
such. Instead it sends three
'ne‘k' Terminators to modern
day America to actually enact
as bodyguards to a scientist
who is to perfect Artiﬁcial
Intelligence, and therefore
inject the necessary spark
into creating 'The Machine'.
Similarly, a bunch of
human combat troops from
the future have come back to
kill the scientist and prevent
The Machine from ever
coming to pass, almost as if
it's a complete swap on the
plot of the ﬁrst cinematic
episode.
The artwork is
exhilarating, the storyline
(across four parts) moves at a
pace that although, at times,
leaves certain major
questions unanswered, and a
few errors in continuity (why
has one of the Terminators
got his face covered in
bandages in one frame, and
only half-covered in others?),
but these are just rather petty
niggles and I'd prefer to stick
to saying that if you were
even slightly turned-on by the
original, this'd get you a slice
of action that under 18s will
be sorely missing.

(Guns 'n
C
they keep getting
into trouble) Los
Angeles band Guns 'n'
Roses are probably the
ideal people to have done
the T2 theme. Apart from
the fact that their
marauding metal sound
slots well into the ﬁlm's
leather, bikes and guns
action atmosphere, they
once released a single on a
Robots!)
record label called 'Uzi
Suicide'. Maybe Arnie
would be proud!
The band have had four
Top 10 singles now. 'You
could be mine' (the T2
theme) was just the latest
in a string of hits since
1988. In that time there
have been 2 LPs as well.
The new albums 'Use
Your Illusion' 1 & 2 are
planned for release
simultaneously in the next
month or so. But the time
between their ﬁrst album
and this hasn't been easy.
They've been accused
of being racist, anti-gay,
and a bad iﬂuence
on young people.
Lead singer Axl
Rose was sacked
from the band one
evening, then he
came back and
sacked the other
band members, then
they all came back
and sacked the
drummer (who
couldn't get over
the drugs the band
had been taking
whilst on tour).
Most recently,
there was a riot at
one of their US gigs
that caused
$200,000 worth of damage
to their equipment and the
venue. And they're over
here at the end of August!

The only p erso n  with en o u g h  balls
to review this was R ichar d Taylor,
so h ere h e is! ( B o o °  ••• that w a s  a
bit predictable! T h e  Read ers)
T
h is sounds like a
tedious version of break
out, doesn't it? Well,
I'm glad to say it isn't and
has absolutely nothing to do
with it. What is it then?
Football? Pool? Noughts and
crosses? That amazing Lunar
Lander cartridge on the Vic-
20? (God rest its soul) No, it's
all about putting balls on a 3-
d play area.
"Ah ha!" I hear you cry, "I
can see it already. You
control a bad who has to
outwit three computer
opponents and
cover as much
of the board
with his
balls
(ahem)
as
possible.
The
winner is
the player
with the
most points
after everyone
has teleported off
the board." How the hell
did you know? Played it
before?
"Er, no, Just a lucky
guess!".
I don't believe you. You've
been peeping.
"No, honest. What, are
you paranoid or something? I
know what you've been up
to!"
Oh my God! Who are you?
Leave me alone! Arrghh!
Nurse! Help me!
"Calm down, you bloody
schizophrenic nutter. Keep
taking your seretonin pills.
Arguing with yourself.
-
0  How long do you think we can hold back from making a
comment about inﬂatable b... (straining noises)? Oh no, we
couldn't hold it - look at all those INFLATABLE BALLS!!!!!
Indeed."
Who said that? Er, where
was I?
Oh yes, this game. Well,
to be quite honest, it bored
the pants off me. I couldn't
seem to derive any pleasure
at all from playing it. It's idea
is really boring and, er, I
didn't really like it at all. The
graphics are fairly good, the
board looks nice. I feel sorry
for the guy that wrote it, he
obviously tried something
different
and, well
it didn't really work. I liked the
title screen also, and the
music is really good. I just
couldn't really get into the
game.
The idea is to cover as
much of the board as
possible with your coloured
balls (oh dear) and also
change the colour of the
opponents to yours. You can
telepart around the screen, if
you feel it necessary and
place yours balls anywhere.
Once the screen is full, the
players will teleport off the
board and the winner is the
one with the most points after
that.
The graphics are OK, and
the sound is good but I really
recommend you play it ﬁrst to
decide whether its your thing
or not.
Maybe as a budget game
it would stand out more, but
at the asking price it just
doesn't really seem bothering
with.
Sorry guys, we
just didn't get on.

R i c h a rd  T a y l o r reviews the sequel
to Test Drive. Is this the road to
hell? -  Ch o o s e  yo u r steed a n d  g o
with sp eed ...
I nspiration comes hard
when sitting in a dim bar
listening to Steve Miller
and the clicks and clunks of
pool balls.
Maybe I should be fast-
car-cruising down the sea-
front with the sounds of
Metallica's 'Master of
Puppets blaring out of a
200 watt stereo. I'm sure
that would help.
Unfortunately, I don't
have access to a fast car
and I don't live near the sea.
Instead, I will have to do
with a sitting room, with a
large table, a 64 and the
noises of urban life and
clocks going about their
relentless business. (OK,
settings right, now the
review, please! Ed.)
If the idea of fast cars
appeals to you, then maybe
you should look at this game
and play your favourite loud
music very loudly indeed.
Remember Test Drive?
Well this, believe it or not, is
the sequel. You may also
remember that the ﬁrst one
had limited cars and only
one landscape to drive
through. This is where the
follow up differ.
0 • 0 4 . 0 ,
When the game has
loaded, you are presented
with a menu giving the
option to change your car,
opponent and setting. There
are ﬁve disks in the
package, four of which are
dedicated to selection the
above.
There are already a few
cars on the master disk, and
two other disks. These range
from top-of-the-range sports

cars (Ferraris, Porsches,
etc.) to slightly slower 'all-
terrain' cars including Trans
Ams, 1967 Pontiac GTOs
and clapped out Cortinas. I
was rather taken with the
1969 Dodge Charger
Dayton, a muscle car. What
a baby!
There are also two
scenery disks, one of which
is entitled 'California
Challenge' which contains
tracks like Eureka to
Rockport, Santa Barbara to
Mexico and the like.
The other disk is
'European Challenge' on
which you can race through
Germany, Holland, France
and Spain, and a few more.
Once you have decided
which car is best and which
track you'd like to burn, then
you should be ready to go.
Oh, you may like to race the
clock or computer as well.
(Another option.)
When the game has
actually started, you will
realise it is pretty much
exactly like the prequel in
it's control and play. For
anyone unfamiliar with this,
an explanation.
The view you are given is
that of inside the car. You
are able to see the cockpit
fully, with all dials, gears
etc. This obviously changes
from car to car, and it may
be the only time in your life
you can actually see what
its like to sit in an '88
Lamborghini Countach
50005!
The control varies also
from car to car, it is very
easy to lose control of a fast
car going ﬂat out. I preferred
the handling of a Muscle
car.
When you have ﬁnished
the circuit, you
choose another until
you have raced them
all. After this? Well,
who knows. You are
also able to re-select
a car at any time in
between races, so if it
isn't fast enough, go
for another.
On the whole I
found the gamep lay
far too similar to Test
Drive, i.e. I didn't
really like it that much.
The control
throughout isn't too
great and the in-game
graphics are pretty
awful.
It's all very well
presented, even if the
modiﬁcations are a
little difﬁcult and
tedious to operate, but
presentation just
doesn't make a good
game.
The music and
sound is, er, OK. No
it's not, it's bloody
awful! I wasn't
impressed.
I'd say that if you
own TD1, unless you
REALLY liked it, don't
buy this. Not enough
play variation, If you
don't own the other one,
look at this and play it ﬁrst.
It probably costs a lot of
money.
Oh well, it's a nice day
and the sun is really
pounding. I might just go
and cruise down the
Boulevard in my Hillman
Avenger, listening to Chris
Rea's 'Road to Hell' and
have a conversation
*
with David Niven's
fridge.

00-ER! YC'S GOING A
BIT FUNNY:
Yep, your fave C64 mag is having a funny turn,
thrashing about on the ﬂoor like a ﬂipped turtle, and
wetting its knickers after drinking a strange, bubbling
concoction!
But what's happening, me-laddies?
FUNNY THING 1: The design is going to become
funky, ﬂighty, and so downright fruity that you'll all
wonder where you put your dazzle-resistant glasses!
FUNNY THING 2: The regular columns are going to
become a bit more informative (and a bit.more funny)!
FUNNY THING 3: There'll be oodles and oodles more
colour than EVER before (it'll be like we had an
accident in a paint factory), so you'll have to put away your crayons 'cause we've done it for you!
FUNNY THING 4: Loads more reviews will be spattered around the incredibly well-endowed pages!
FUNNY THING 5: And we see the incredible 'from-the-dead'-style return of Rik 'Amigas are crap really, gimmee my Commie
back' Henderson, as Group Editor and all-round cynical old (?) hack!

Storm has volunteered to host the YC 'gimmee more sandwiches and coke' team, and they'll wish they hadn't when they ﬁnd
out their ofﬁce has been turned into a small bedsit for a number of homeless bums (i.e. The YC team).
MY NAME
Please Newsie, I would treat you
like the good or Queen Mum if you'd
be as chummy enough to put aside a
copy of the incredibly splendid YC computer
magazine! For this privelege I'd even give you
quite a fair amount of spondoolies (#1.95 to be
precise), and I would do this every month too!
MY ADDRESS
Give this to y our  N e ws ie  be for e  he emigrates to The
Falklands, a nd be c om e s  a  s he e p farmer!
A  NEW, IMP R OV E D  V E R S ION  Or  ON TH E TAPE:
The tape is going to be well stonky and no mistake. Firstly, we're giving you four incredibly swanky FULL
games (some of which you'll have heard of, and some are completely original), plus one demo of an
upcoming brill game. And secondly, the On The Tape section (retitled 'Wheels of Steel') is to
EXPAND, and give you some interesting things that nobody else has thought of yet.
t>tr1:076
It's as chunky as dog huuuueeeey!
Oth zisPT
Once upon a time we really, really tried to supply exactly
what was stated on the next month page, but now we
couldn't give a sod! So if the next month page
and the actual real content of the speciﬁed
magazine were in any way different it's
only because we've found something
even more stiffy to put in instead!!!
What's the matter,
luv? Newsie's run out
of the latest splendid
issue of VC, then?

for footie fanatics, if you're
not one you'll be bored out of

You need a friend to play

use your annoying little

suggests.
Transfer markets,
bookings (Gazza's speciality),

Although there's no sob

An remember, it's not

the 'tricks of the trade' will
not work. You know the sort,
"Ref! He dived!", or the
famous 'Oscar for the best

in English football.
Pn the whole, 2PSS is a

SPEAKS!
Well footle fans, Jason the new expert will give you an extra
bit of advice for nothing. We here in "YC'' are considerate to
our readers and don't want you to waste your money. If the
game is rubbish, we'll say it's rubbish - I am not the sort of
person to play around with my words.
So, out of the four footie sims, by far the best is Striker
Manager, with Professional Footballer a very close secon.
These are the sort of games the Germans practice on,
and look! They are the champions of the world. So why are
you standing around? Practice and you could be the next
manager of England and have glory just like in 1966!
Use your 424 or 433 tatics to become number one -
those are not numbers for any bus or Chinese resturant!

3D Constructi
"Build it up, build it up, build it
higher! Build it up, up, up, up, u p
into the sky-er!" san g  R i c h a r d
T a y lo r as h e tried o u t this
'freescap e' g a me  creator_
A
into the real world
from a deep and
powerfully relaxing sleep, I
wondered to myself what it
would be like to use a 3D,
almost "virtual reality"
generator on the 64. "Comfy
bed simulator" I mused in a
stupid 45% awake thought.
Sounds like a Codemasters
game.
After waking up,
showering and treating
myself to a 5 mile jog. (lies! -
Ed.) the thought still stuck in
my head. Would it be
possible to generate an
entire 3 dimensional world
moving smoothly from
location to location with the
ability to fully explore the
terrain? No. I decided
suddenly, it wouldn't, as
more habitual thoughts of
entering a public house
entered my mind.
The next morning after
strolling into the more than
adequately luxurious YC
ofﬁces, I was greeted by an
enthusiastic Mr Davy,
hopping from foot to foot
clutching a large, black,
fearsome-looking box.
'Look", he spluttered
excitedly. "It's a 3D
Construction Kit for the 64.
rye often wondered, in
hypnagogic states, what it
would be like to use one of
these. Here, go and review
it."
So I sat down and waited
in wonder for the disk to
load.
Where do I start? 3D
Construction Kit is a pretty
incredible piece of software.
It has many applications but I
suppose the one that will
appeal to YC readers the
most is the fact that you can
create your own games with
it. These games, once
SHADT
created, can be compiled to
run independently of the
main program and even,
according to the literature,
can be distributed and sold
as long as the program is
credited. Castle is an
example of a game
created with
this
package.
So what's it
all about? How do you go
about it?
Basically, the program
will let you select shapes
(cube, pyramid, hexagon etc)
that can be placed anywhere
within the allocated area.
These objects can then be
shrunk, stretched, rotated
and moved around until you
decide what's right.
Once you have put a
shape in place, other shapes
can be added to created a
desired object. For example,
if you placed a pyramid o n
top of a cube, with a bit of
stretching and shrinking, a
house type shape will be
achieved.
Windows and doors can
then be added using the two
dimensional shapes. Doors
can be turned into entrances
that lead to other areas so
you can actually enter your
house.
Inside the
house? Well who
knows? It's up to you.
With a bit of manipulatio
any shape can be achieved
so the only limitations are
really your own imaginatioﬂ
The demo game brilliantly
demonstrates the use of
shape creation,. It is worth
studying this to get an idea'
of what you can do.
The control system is
very easy to use as
everything is icon-driven.
The ﬁrst menu contains
load/save create/delete and
colour, etc. From th
speciﬁc sub menus are
d' played.
ust above the main
menu are the movement
icons. You can do the
standard "Dungeon Mast
type movement from here,
e.g. forward, backward, fag
left and right and step left
and right. The whole area
can be rotated from any
int and can be faced up
nd down so in effect you
an move anywhere within a
true 3 dimensional space.
.) Y o u  can have the
mplete freedom of a beePT
Ifterent modes of
ovement can be selbagd
m walk, to ﬂy 1 and 2.
Walk will give an unaided
Liman-type view, ﬂy 1 will
give a "ietpack"-type view
but you will move along a
constant parallel and ﬂy2
move you in any direction
you are facing.
Very simple once you
have tried it. You also have a
view icon which will let yo u

Off the main menu you

tion Kit
•-• -
can go to the Edit Object
Panel which will let you alter
the dimensions of the
selected object.
The shade menu will alter
the shade or colour off the
object.
Once you have put
together an environment you
can then enter the
programming mode to set
onclitions within your world.
,For example, 0 0  can allocate
doors that can be opened or
entered, walls etc that can be
shot (Oh, I forgot to mention
that you are armed with an
Elite-type laser!) and things
that can be picked up.
Don't be put off by thiS
you can't program at all, the
language is very simple and
contains commands like
"IFSHOT THEN" meaning if
you shoot speciﬁed object

Doors are easilyma d e
accessible e.g. the program
would look like this:
IFHIT 4

GOTO 1 2
meaning if the shape 4 is hit
(door or what ever) then go
from area one to two. The

can become very ﬂuent in it's
use.
It is impossible to explain
all the features in this review,
there are many more for "ﬁne
tuning" of things, mainly
through the language.
This couldn't really be
called purely a game creator,
as it has many more serious
applications. I don't know if
these would work overly well
on the 64 (machine limitation,
not software) but it would be
possible to design an entire in
the smallest detail, car,
rocket, boat or clockwork
ﬁsh, the possibilities are
almost endless.
Maybe we could run a
competition for the best
design or game using this
package.
If you want to write a
game and you cannot
program, then I would
recommend you buy this. If
you want to use your 64 for
design, then buy this. If you
are bored of your computer
and want to do something
new on it, then buy this.
In fact, I would
recommend this to just about
anybody with a 64 as I am
sure anyone can entertain
themselves with it in some
way.
Overall, an extremely
versatile piece of software,
technically amazing, easy and
great fun to use. This could be
the future of home
micro software, go
and buy it!

BUBBLE
BOBBLE
I
on my 64 when it ﬁrst
came out, this is the ﬁrst
time I've actually seen it. The
arcade machine was pretty
damn addictive and so is this
version!
A quick explanation for
anyone who is not familiar
with this game. The idea is to
guide Bub and Bob (two
players simultaneously)
around a platform type
screen, shooting various
enemies with "killer bubbles".
When you shoot the
AMERICAN 3D POOL
I
game on the Amiga
some time ago and
it really didn't seem
to work very well. I
didn't think this
would be very good
at all.
I was surprised to
ﬁnd that it is really
quite a playable
game and it looks
really good.
To actually aim at
a ball, you are
presented with a top-
view 2D view of the
table, and you must
point the cursor at
the space you want the ball to go for.
Once you have done this, a 3D table is displayed and you press ﬁre to start
the shot, pressing again when the powerbar has reached the desired height. If
you do not press ﬁre a second time, then the shot goes to full power so you have
to be quick.
The balls move well and bounce around in a convincing way. Once all the
colours have been potted, the black ball must go down to assure your victory.
Two players can play, so it could be fun to play a friend, cheaper too.
There are other
games you can pick
within the program,
such as Billiards, a
tournament and even
a trick shot editor.
The graphics look
good and work really
well and what sound
there is ﬁts
appropriately.
In all, a fun game,
good to play a friend

enemies, the
bubble encases
them and you have to go and
pick them up. When you do
this, they drop fruit that
bounces away and can be
retrieved for bonus points.
Once all the enemies have
been disposed of, then next
screen is entered.
Sounds easy? Well, it
gets really hard! There over
over 100 levels and loads of
bonus screens and bits.
The control is really good,
you can bounce around
everywhere and even on top
of your own bubbles. If you
have two joysticks and no
friends, then go out and
socialise for a few weeks to
get to know people so you
can invite them back to play
two player. It really is worth
it.
Loads of graphics and
tinkly music and jingles, all
adds up to a classic game
that should not be missed at
this budget price.
Great fun!

RENEGADE
I I I
O
the part of street-
wise funky dude, the
"Renegade'', the all-round
nice guy super hero who
must again rescue his
girlfriend from "forces of the
future".
These forces have
somehow managed to travel
back in time and leave your
girlfriend in the middle of a
prehistoric land surrounded
by cavemen and dinosaurs.
You must walk along
beating up these things in
this level, then you are
teleported a bit further
forward in time to ancient
Egypt with zombies and
Heiroglyphics and then to
'dark age' England with
Knights and dragons.
The control and
movement is fairly standard
with combat moves when
ﬁre is held down. The
enemies are fairly hard to
kill, and require quite a bit of
punishment.
Time is also tight, so you
need to hurry.
This game looks good,
and the sound effects and
music ﬁt in really nicely. If
you didn't like the previous
an almost "Flimbos Quest''
fashion.
The graphics, sprites in
particular, are really good in
this part with Captain
Caveman strutting around
doing his thang.
If you make it through
Renegades, then don't
worry. This isn't really much
like them at all.
I'd say this was worth
buying if you're looking for a
decent budgie game

What a hard and

Oh well, his choice I suppose.
You got it, 1920's Chicago
and you take the part of Mr
Ness in an attempt to bring
justice to many gangsters
and hoodlums, The ultimate
objective is to ﬁnd Al Capone
and destroy his evil empire of
booze and violence.
You start this mission in a
warehouse, in which you
must locate various items of
evidence in an attempt to
accumulate enough to use
against Capone.
You have sprung at a
good time, a large booze
movement operation is taking
place and book-keepers are
present. You must take the
opportunity to seize their
books.
Also lying around are
extra energy pods,
ammunition and the like.
Loads of baddies are
wandering around, so you'd
better be quick on the draw.
Level two is a bridge
which is being used to
transport liquor in to America
across the Canadian border.
You can swap between
untouchables - you need to
change to avoid the
henchmen.
Level three takes place in
back street alleys, with you
trying to stop Capone's
accountant from making a

this was OK. not

ﬁx factor was there. Since it
seemed to rely heavily on
graphics, I couldn't see it
converting too well to the
old 64. It hasn't really.
The idea is to complete
various sections of a moon
base by destroying
everything within them and

collecting coins
and bonus objects to
modify your tank.
Enemies include gun
posts, tank and UFOs. Gun
posts must be shot at the
right time to be destroyed.
Also lying around are
mines that must be avoided
at all costs. You are given
an energy bar and can take
quite a few hits.
The control of the tank is
slightly awkward and must
be rotated through 45
degrees with forward to
move in that direction.
One good thing is that
two players can play at the
same time, so friends can
join in.
Once a screen is
completed you are given
the option to modify your
tank with extra
ﬁrepower, shields,
etc. to build up a proverbial
bottom-kicker.
If enough sections are
completed, then you are
transported to another
planet that must also be
destroyed. Once they are all
destroyed then, er, I don't
know, actually. I never got
that far.
That graphics are good
in places, with some ﬂashy
effects to keep you
amused. Loads of rotating
characters and colours.
It's ok as far as budget
games go, so if you were a
fan of the arcade version
it's worth a look. Nothing
outstanding, faulted by bad
control and lack of depth.

REVIEW
KEYS TO MARAMON
MINDCRAFT/ELECTRONIC
ARTS
DISK
If you have ever wanted to
delve into role-playing but
thought that the present
batch of RPGs are a little bit
heavy, or if you fancied a
little more action to your
RPGs, then Keys to
Maramon is your bag.
Including short, concise
documentation, Keys allows
you to you assume the role
of one of four heroes:
Hunter, Blacksmith, Scholar
or King's Courtier (the only
female character). Each has
four basic ratings for Speed,
Dexterity, Strength and Life
Points.
Your quest is to save the
town from the monsters who
come out to loot each
evening. Final success
hinges on cleaning out the
catacombs beneath
Maramon and confronting
the usual "ultimate bad guy"
who's responsible for all the
trouble.
Actually the title tells you
w A
of one of the game's
principle assets k e y s .  You
start with a key to the
strongrooms.
Access to the catacombs
below hinges on collecting
other keys, each of ever
more precious metal. The
better the key, the further the
access. You will have quite
an extensive key ring before
the end of the game.
Weapons available
provide a good selection of
the usual swords, axes and
hammers (which suffer wear
( : " 4
and tear). These are melee
weapons, which means you
must saunter up to
monsters, look them in the
eye and press the ﬁre button
for all you're worth!
The bows and arrows
actually ﬁre "ranged"
missiles, so monsters can be
hosed from a safer distance.
The downside about arrows
is that you can only pack 99
of them and 99 shots can go
pretty quickly.
Magic weaponry is
available. Ice, Flame and

Fear wands (the former two
ﬁring damage at range, the
latter holding a monster in its
place for a time). These are
expensive weapons,
however. While the Scholar
has the best magic skills
rating of the four characters,
the others seem to fare
better with cheaper, and
easier to wield, steel.
The real heart of the
game is to become an avid
reader in the town's library.
For every 1,000 experience
points, the proper book can
E  T r  ILJ 
E
be "read" from the closed
stacks in order to gain a
statistics points for a basic
attribute.
By simply shelling out
serious dosh, the rare book
room can be visited for some
major clues and aid to your
character. Be sure to take a
few notes when spending
time in the re a r book room.
Everything learned there will
make a lot of sense towards
the end of the adventure.
The armour is the usual
leather, ring mail, chain mail
and steel plate. Upscale
suits include methreal (as
opposed to mithral) and, if
found while dungeon-
delving, pearl armour (all the
snappy dressers know that
Maramon is famous for its
pearls). There are no
penalties, however, for
wearing heavier armour, so
batten down, button up and
battle through.
Magic in the Keys revolve
around herbs and
mushrooms. Depending on
the ﬂavour they will increase
your basic statistics or up
the armour class (all with a
temporary effect, so pack a
big lunch). The vital herbs
and potions are the ones
which, naturally, restore Life
Points.
Keys to Maramon arrives
on one disk, so no disk
swapping is required. A 28-
page manual plus a C64
speciﬁc reference card is
also included. Copy
protection is manual based.
Keys is an ideal RPG for
the new adventurer providing
a large dollop of addictive
gameplay. Well designed
and easy to get into, Keys to
Maramon is heartily
recommended.

If you haven't heard of them

a rather spiffy group from
Leeds (home of ﬂat caps,

interesting feature, apart from
their ability to write greatly
entertaining and often

C'mon, hands up all those

by the 'plague of baby

though I'd immediately put
my hand up (if I didn't have
one of the little blighters

the ﬁlms that really stood out
as good pictures; Three Men

course, Look Who's Talking.
Now, like the recent
release of Three Men and a

trying to catch the tide of the
'Baby Boom' just before it
hits the shore and wipes out,
with the release of Look

Nick (Kevin Bacon) is a
director straight out of ﬁlm
school and into the 'big time'
of trying to cut the grade
when it comes to Hollywood
breaks. Unfortunately, he
ﬁnds out that to make it in the
tough biz of ﬁlm making, his
friends and loves all have to
take a deﬁnite back seat, as
he falls over hurdles that he
never even knew existed.
Now if this sounds like a
completely crap idea for a
ﬁlm you might as well go rent
out Rocky (insert number)
and get yourself some
popcorn.
The Big Picture is a very
clever and amusing spoof of
the Hollywood scene, and
although you have to be on
the ball at all times - its plot
seems to dart from one small,
seemingly insigniﬁcant
scene to another -
perseverance will reward
you with many laughs, an
enjoyable night, and a

American daytime TV is a
trashy, low-budget affair, in
general. 'The Sun Also Sets', the
ﬁctional, top-rated daytime soap
in this ﬁlm is no exception.
Sally Field plays Celeste
Talbert, the show's longest-
appearing and most popular
actor, who has to put up with a
life of last-minute script-
changes and the most
calculating bunch of off-screen
detractors and rivals that you'll
have seen for a while.
Even though head-

scriptwriter Rose (Goldberg) is
on her side, she still has to
contend with the scheming of
her co-stars and other writers,
not to mention the sudden
reappearance in the script of
Jeffrey Anderson (Kline),
although he was chucked out
twenty years previously, at the
instigation of Talbert's arch-rival
co-star Montana Moorhead.
The ﬁlm itself turns out to be
something of a lame affair and, •
although amusing in parts, just
doesn't add that much new to
the genre of ﬁlms/programmes
about Soaps. Its funny turns
include Talbert visiting shopping
centres just for the boost to her
ego of being recognised and the
bizarre twist of a new (and
immediately successful) actor's
parentage.
Unfortunately, the ending
seems to have been largely
lifted from the classic Dustin
Hoffman ﬁlm Tootsie. And, sadly
for Soapdist% Hoffman did it

B I G  T H R I L L
"yeh, 'it 'im in the nuts" way!
Stallone is a model
prisoner (that doesn't mean
he's made from wood -

acting is) and when he's
transferred from an open
prison to the harsh
surroundings of Gateway -
run by a Warden with a chip
the size of several potatoes
on his shoulder (Donald
Sutherland) - things aren't
quite so rosy.
The ﬁlm, like a few that
have graced us recently (An
Innocent Man, Death
Warrant, etc.), is not so
much a tale of one man,
more a look at the American
prison system as
a whole, and if
such prisons exist,
the acting here is
extremely good.
Lock Up's a
ﬁlm that would be
enjoyed by
rampaging anti-
prison activists, and
lovers of Stallone
violence-orientated

FAIRY TALES
OF BATS, CATS
AND RATS
What's up? Seems like only
last month I was throwing
together this spectrum of
speculative speciousness
(look it up, dude!). And -
whaddya know - it was!
Reading between the
schedules there's a lot going
on, and although at the
moment much of it seems to
involve WOLVES, LAMBS or
THIEVES, by the time you
read this it'll mostly be bats,
cats and rats.
Bats: the intriguing
ADDAMS FAMILY movie -
starring (as predicted in Tales
a hundred years ago) Raul
Julia (Gomez), Anjelica
Huston (Morticia) and
Christopher Lloyd (Uncle
Fester, natch) - is all
wrapped up and ready for
Christmas. Based on the
Charles Addams cartoons of
the '30s and '40s (and later
the American '50s TV
series), THE ADDAMS
FAMILY is likely to be a well-
cast hoot...
Cats: Annette Bening's
careless pregnancy by
Warren Beatty has lost her
what would have been a
classic role - Catwoman in
BATMAN 2.
After a brief affair with
Madonna and Cher, the tabs
(tabloids to you, creep!)

actor Michael J.Pollard (the

2008, where a vicious dude is

The unprecedented success
of TERMINATOR 2:
JUDGMENT DAY has sent
studios scurrying for sequel
scripts again - most
unthrilling.
While THE OMEN IV: THE
AWAKENING and PSYCHO
IV: THE BEGINNING have
both been trundled out for
American TV, further
instalments have been
announced for a surfeit of
other product. THE NAKED
GUN 33 1/3: FOR THE
RECORD will follow
TRANCERS II and FANTASIA
CONTINUED (an 'update' of
the classic Disney feature)
into production, while
HIGHLANDER III: THE
MAGICIAN (also predicted in
Tales) has also got the green
light.
Contrary to my Tales
prediction, however, H3 will
star Christopher Lambert,
and will be set somewhere
between the ﬁrst
HIGHLANDER and the
appalling sequel - good
move, if the script can pull it
oft.
Meanwhile, don't believe

director James Cameron's off
to make THE CROWDED

rapist with 24 different
personalities, while Amie's

BONFIRE OF THE
VANITIES, the ﬁrst of my
spiffy new Video Of The

Rated a 'miss' on the
big screen, Brian
DePalma's dark adaptation of
Tom Wolfe's best-selling
novel - starring Tom Hanks,
Bruce Willis, Melanie Grifﬁth
and Kim Cattrall (the latter a
superb but grossly
underrated performance) -
actually works brilliantly on
video and should be rented
immediately.
Also on video (sell-
through, this time) are the
rather splendid 'widescreen'
versions of big screen
classics ALIEN, DIE HARD
and the three STAR WARS
movies. Usually when ﬁlms
are transferred to video, up to
two thirds of the screen area
is lost (compare the shape of
your TV screen with that of a
cinema and you'll see why),
so you're Only getting two
thirds of the movie. With
Fox's 'widescreen releases,
however, they've shrunk the
whole screen area down to ﬁt
on a TV screen as a rectangle
(this is known as 'letterbox'
format). If you
missed any of
these at the cinema (like I did
-  I was only ten when ALIEN
(X-rated) came out!), you'll
never know how big they
really were unless you buy

about trash, popniks primed
and armed with tab ritzy street
glam". At VC, we take that to
mean that they're a bunch of
dance-pods with a colourful
sense of dress and humour.
Stella herself is the singer and,
on the new single, "People",
complements the Beatles
samples and 'get-down' dance
beat excellently. Their stage
shows, too, are a joy to behold
strawberry-red smoke and
soap-ﬂakes course over the
crowd as Intastella let loose
their wholesome and tuneful
dance toons. They too have an
LP on its way...
PERFECT POP
Bands that can t h e
perfect chart-pop s .
Candy Skins
You will have come across the
Candy Skins in July's YC,
where they were billed as
offering "no-nonsense guitary
songs like The Stone Roses or
even 60's bands such as The
Monkees". And they do,
especially on their LP which
should be out now. Recently
they got into trouble with the
welkpaid lawyers of the Rolling
sump,% who wanted to see 'em
in coOrt over a sample of the
'.-tones' "Satisfaction" in the
Candy Skins rather great cover
, version of an old 60's Buffalo
Springﬁeld song. The case
continues!
Poppy
Factory
The
'Fabulous
Beast' EP is
the third
from
Bradford's
Poppy Factory, a group whose
lead singer and guitarist Jock
Cotton wears Polka-dot
pyjamas on stage! Apart from
plying a brand of perfect
keyboard-and-guitar pop, when
they play live they decorate the
area around themselves with
futuristic sculptures made from
bits of metal and papier-mache
that are made by some odd
sculptor-friends of theirs. Songs
like "7x7"" (which samples 60's
ﬁlm star Albert Finney) and
"Stars" which has swathes of
trippy guitar are truly chart-pop
songs for the 90's.
HOT elOCKERS
People with a little more
gritty, loud, rock meat to
their sound.
Teenage Fanclub
"Probably the best Scottish
group since... the BaVCfty
oilers" (dodgy 70's group that
wore Tartan ﬂares), it says here,
but then Press Ofﬁcers always
do have wild'imaginations! Either
w a y ,  I l a c r  P a n d i t ' )  d o  h a v e
a very good way of using their
electric guitars (which are
connected to enough effects
pedals that make their sound
extra-hotign.ingy/ loud, etc.) to
craft ace rock
songs. They lift
you up and
slam you to
the wall,
inspired as
they are by
noisy
American
rock bands
of the 80's. If
you like your
music
ﬂavoured with
extra rock power,
get a load of TFC.
Blue Aeroplanes
What can you say about an eight
member rock band who have a
mighty barrage of electric guitars
and have a dancer amongst
their number? A dancer that
jumps onto and swings from
anything in sight? Their lead
B I G
singer, Gerard Langley
(who wears cool-dude
sunglasses ALL the
time), is more of a lead-
poet, belting forth a
stream of words and
phrases. It's unlike any
band you'll have heard
before. Couple that with
a brilliant rock guitar
sound and you've got one of the
best rawk-'n'-roll bands on the
planet, and no mistaking.
MINDBLOWERS
Obscure, mind-frying
guitar sounds, not for
Vanilla ice fans!
Spitﬁre
It's not the car. It's not the
plane. It's the attitude." say
Sp i ,  musicians with an
attitude formed by listening to
too much
60's and
70's rock
music, like
that of Jim,
Hendrix,
and
watching
too much
trashy TV,
like
Starsky
and Hutch
and The Six Billion Dollar Man -
they do a version of the latter's
theme tune! So their
compositions are a heady brew
of wah-wah guitar and heavy
throb, an experience not to be
passed up. "We are easily one of
the more talented bands around
at the moment." they conclude,
modestly
Chapterhouse
Lastly, but not leastly, we
come to Chapterhouse,
a set of long-fringed
songsters who already
play to 1,500 people in
London and who
produce swirling
maelstroms of effects-
pedal-driven sound with
mean, almost dancey,
beats beneath. Their
album, 'Whirlpool', is full of
such tunes, each one a minor
classic in its own right. They like
to put on impressive stage-
shows aswell, full of smoke and
ﬂashing lights that really make
the music go down great. There
are many people who sound
similar to them, but only a few
that sound as good.
