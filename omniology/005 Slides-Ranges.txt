Ranges
●
A range is a type that represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly 
used for looping a specific number of times in for loops.
●
We use ranges each time we want our application to execute a repetitive task.
●
There is a built-in function called range() that returns ranges of numbers.  
●
The general form of an range is:
range(start, stop, step)
By default:
-
start = 0
-
step = 1
-
start is included
-
stop is excluded
