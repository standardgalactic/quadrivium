 How to Use This Book 
 Congratulations on committing to studying to take the Project Management Professional 
(PMP) credential.

as some extra information about the profession of project management. 
 Here is a guide to all the extra bits and pieces in the book:
• 
 Words in Italics: These are key terms, and you should try to 
memorize and understand all of them. Each is included in the 
Glossary of Key Terms at the rear of the book.  
• 
 Exam tips: These highlighted pieces of text give you direct tips 
for the exam. 
•

 CHAPTER 1  
 Foundational Concepts of 
Project Management 
 This chapter describes foundational concepts of the PMBOK ®  Guide. It introduces you 
to the purpose and content of the PMBOK Guide and provides definitions of projects, 
project management, program management, portfolio management, organizational 
project management, operations management, organizational strategy, business value, 
and the project life cycle. All of these foundational concepts are important to ensure that 
you understand the terminology used by the PMBOK Guide, which also appears in the 
PMP ® exam. It is important that you take time to fully understand these concepts, because 
they underpin many of the processes, tools, and techniques that come later in the book. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Remember that the PMP exam tests a lot of elements, including your 
understanding of the PMBOK Guide terminology and concepts. You may come across a 
question that has an answer that is what you would actually call something in real life but is 
 not how the PMBOK Guide would refer to it. In this instance, always answer according to the 
PMBOK Guide. Also, pay close attention not only to the terms but also to the various inputs 
and outputs.

 The Purpose of the PMBOK Guide 
 
■ More Info   The PMBOK  Guide 
 You can read more about the purpose of the  PMBOK Guide , 5th edition, in the guide itself, in 
Chapter 1, section 1.1. 
 The full title of the PMBOK Guide is  A Guide to the Project Management Body 
of Knowledge. If you break that down into its component parts, you can get an 
understanding of what sort of document it is. 
 First of all, it is a guide. This means it is not a prescriptive instruction manual that 
must be followed to the letter, and individuals and organizations can, and do, choose to 
implement only appropriate portions of the PMBOK Guide. It presents the information 
as a guide for you to use when and if it is useful. Obviously, it is a guide to the profession 
of project management. Because the profession of project management is both relatively 
young and also very wide in its application, any book purporting to be about it is 
necessarily both iterative and also broad in the information it contains. 
 This is the 5th edition of the  PMBOK Guide and represents a major change from 
previous versions: it includes an extra knowledge area and more in-depth coverage of 
foundation topics. The development and updating of the PMBOK Guide is an ongoing 
process; an updated edition is released every three to four years. Make sure you have 
access to the latest copy of the PMBOK Guide. It is also aligned with ISO 21500:2012 
Guidance on Project Management. 
 
■ Exam Tip   ISO 21500:2012 is an international standard for project management 
developed by the International Organization for Standardization. (The initials ISO come from 
the French way of saying this.) It provides guidance and a high-level description of concepts 
and processes that are considered to form good or best practice in the profession of project 
management. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
3
 Finally, as a body of knowledge, it contains what is considered to be a fairly complete 
set of knowledge about the profession of project management. Many professions, 
including civil engineering, software engineering, contracting, and even massage therapy 
have bodies of knowledge associated with them. Overall, the PMBOK Guide presents 
what is generally recognized to be good practice in the profession of project management. 
This means the processes, tools, and techniques that it presents are useful to most 
projects most of the time. It is up to the organization or the project management team to 
determine which, if any, of the processes, tools, or techniques are useful for any project 
they are working on. This process of selecting only those processes, tools, and techniques 
that actually provide benefit when managing your projects is called  tailoring . 
 
REAL WORLD
 The  PMBOK Guide is not a project management methodology. It is a framework 
document containing the collection of what is considered good project management 
practice for projects of any size, complexity, and industry. In order to build a project 
management methodology, you are directed to take from the PMBOK Guide only 
those processes, tools, and techniques that are appropriate and add value to your 
project via the process of tailoring. 
 In addition to representing a robust body of knowledge, the PMBOK Guide also 
presents standardized terminology. This means there is generally a single word or phrase 
to define and describe each element of project management. It allows project managers 
and project team members in the same organization, and between organizations, to 
communicate effectively. 
 
REAL WORLD
 The benefit of a  standardized terminology cannot be overestimated. I have been in 
many situations with people from different organizations who made simple mistakes 
because they used different words for the same thing. I once asked a contract 
manager on my team for the project schedule, and he sent me the schedule of 
materials. After three requests and increasing confusion on both sides, we finally 
figured out that I was requesting what he referred to as the project timeframe. On 
another occasion, I was assisting a firm that was growing rapidly and recruiting 
project managers every week. The biggest challenge they faced was the different 
terminology all these experienced project managers used. We worked on developing 
a common organization-wide project management vocabulary to improve 
communication between all the project managers and project team members. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
4
 Of course, your main interest in the PMBOK Guide is that it is a very useful text on 
which to base your study for the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification. 
Passing the PMP exam requires knowledge of the entire contents of the PMBOK Guide, 
as well as knowing the “Project Management Institute Code of Ethics and Professional 
Conduct.” 
 
■ Exam Tip   Even if you had a  photographic memory and could remember every page of 
the PMBOK Guide, you would not necessarily score 100% on the PMP exam, because the 
exam is based on the results of a role-delineation study about what professional attributes 
a project manager should have. The PMBOK Guide is a very useful text on which to base 
your study, because its contents are built on the knowledge of many disciplines, and often a 
single phrase or sentence in the PMBOK Guide can refer to an entire other subject area. That 
is why simply studying the  PMBOK Guide is not the best approach to preparing to sit the 
PMP exam. This book not only introduces you to the entire contents of the PMBOK Guide but 
also presents a lot of other information so you are prepared to pass the exam.

 What Is a Project, a Program, and a Portfolio? 
 
■ More Info   Project, Program, Portfolio 
 You can read more about the definition of a project, a program, and a portfolio in the PMBOK 
Guide, 5th edition, in Chapter 1, section 1.2. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
5
 It may seem straightforward to define exactly what a  project  is, but it is important 
that you know how the PMBOK Guide defines one. Several key elements separate project 
work from ongoing or operational work. 
 The first and most important element of a project is that it has a defined start and 
end, making it a temporary endeavor. On the other hand, operational, or ongoing, work is 
ongoing and repetitive. 
 A project also delivers something unique—something that hasn’t been done before. 
Ongoing work is repetitive and delivers the same thing every day or every year. 
 Finally, a project delivers a product, service, or result. This allows projects to be used 
to deliver a range of deliverables in many industries, whether they are based on goods or 
services. 
 
■ Exam Tip   There are only two types of work in the world, according to the PMBOK 
Guide. All work is either operational work or project work. If it is operational work, then it is 
repetitive and ongoing. If it is project work, then it has a defined start, middle, and end and 
delivers a product, service, or result. 
 
REAL WORLD
 You may find a degree of overlap between project work and operational work. There 
are certainly some projects that bear a striking resemblance to each other and 
perhaps could be construed as ongoing work. It is the unique aspect of each—and 
that it is done slightly differently, in a different location, to produce a slightly different 
product, service, or result—that makes it a project. 
 A portfolio of projects includes all the projects, whether interdependent or not, 
that an organization is undertaking. They are connected only by their common goal of 
delivering the organization’s strategic goals. 
 A  program of projects describes projects that have some sort of interdependency 
between them. They may all be part of a larger deliverable; for example, you could have 
several projects, each of which makes a different part of a new aircraft, but the final 
deliverable depends on managing the projects together as a program. The projects may 
also share a common goal, and the program manager needs to monitor and resolve any 
actual or potential conflicts in the pursuit of those goals. 
 A project can be part of a program and part of a portfolio. Figure  1-1 shows that all 
programs are part of a portfolio, but that projects can be either directly part of a portfolio 
or part of a program. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
6
 Project, program, and portfolio management are separate yet interrelated elements 
of the profession of project management. The combination of the project management, 
program management, and portfolio management disciplines is seen as integral and 
necessary to deliver the organizational strategy; and, therefore, any action undertaken in 
any of the three elements should always align with the organization’s strategy. 
 Portfolio management ensures that all projects selected to be completed by the 
organization align with the organizational strategy. Portfolio management has an 
organizational scope that reflects the organizational strategy. Often projects or programs 
are grouped together into a single portfolio that reflects a specific strategy. 
 
■ Exam Tip   The PMBOK Guide places a great deal of emphasis on the alignment of 
organizational strategy and the profession of project management as a strategic enabler 
for delivering the strategy. Always assume that the default position in a question is that an 
organization has a strategy and is using project management to achieve that strategy. 
 Program management focuses on managing interdependencies within projects with 
a common goal or capability. Program managers are skilled at forecasting, anticipating, 
and dealing with real or perceived conflict between projects in the same program. All 
programs have projects, but not all projects are part of programs. 
 Figure 1-1.  The relationship between portfolios, programs, and projects in an 
organization 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT

■ Exam Tip   An interesting distinction made by the PMBOK Guide is that if the relationship 
between separate projects is based on having a shared client or seller, or shared technology 
or resources, then the projects should be managed as a portfolio rather than a program. 
 The  project management office (PMO ) is the part of the organization responsible 
for project management excellence. It provides support for the project manager, which 
can mean many things, depending on the level of organizational project management 
maturity. A PMO can simply be a place where a project management methodology is 
developed and stored; or, at the other end of the spectrum, it can be where all the project 
managers are located, which provides common reporting, manages shared resources, 
and is responsible for portfolio, program, and project management across the entire 
organization. 
 The PMBOK Guide defines three main types of PMO, differentiated by the level of 
control and influence they have, as shown in Figure  1-2 . The  supportive  PMO provides 
templates and basic processes and captures lesson learned. The  controlling  PMO may 
take responsibility for development and implementation of a project management 
methodology and provide project governance as well. The  directive PMO takes direct 
control of management of projects in the organization. 
 Figure 1-2.  The types of  project management office (PMO) , from supportive to directive 
 The type of PMO an organization should have also depends on the level 
of organizational project management maturity the organization has attained. 
 Organizational project management maturity is a way of assessing where an organization 
is currently with its level of sophistication and maturity around project management 
processes, tools, templates, and methodology, and then assessing where they should 
be. Organizations handling large and complex projects should be at a higher level of 
project management maturity than organizations managing small and simple projects. 
Organizations with a high level of project management maturity should have a more 
directive PMO. 
 
■ Exam Tip   If you see a reference to OPM3 in the exam, it is referring to the 
Organizational Project Management Maturity Model, which is a tool from the Project 
Management Institute (PMI) for assessing an organization’s level of portfolio, program, and 
project management maturity.

 3. 
 How would you describe the main differences between 
project, program, and portfolio management? 
 
 4. 
 What function would a project management office play in 
an organization with a high level of project management 
maturity? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 First, a project has a temporal element defining a start and 
an end, making it temporary rather than ongoing. Second, it 
delivers something unique and never done before. Finally, it 
involves delivery of a product, service, or result.  
 
 2. 
 In a program of projects, the projects share an 
interdependency, whereas in a portfolio of projects, the 
projects are united only by the fact that they are all being 
completed by the same organization. 
 
 3. 
 Portfolio management is the top-level selection process of 
projects to ensure that they deliver the organization’s strategy. 
A program of projects contains projects that share a common 
goal or capability, and individual projects are focused on 
delivering a product, service, or result that will contribute to 
achievement of the organizational strategy. Remember that 
all programs have projects, but not all projects are part of 
programs. 
 
 4. 
 An organization with a high level of project management 
maturity will use a directive project management office to take 
control of the way in which all projects are selected, managed, 
reported on, and communicated about in the organization. 
 What Is Project Management? 
 
■ More Info   Project Management 
 You can read more about the definition of project management in the PMBOK Guide, 
5th edition, in Chapter 1, section 1.3. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT

 Project management takes the tools, techniques, and skills contained in the PMBOK 
Guide and applies them to the project to deliver the product, service, or result. It is a 
proactive, rather than a reactive, discipline. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Being proactive is a key point about professional project management. If a 
question on the exam gives you the option to be proactive, it is probably the correct answer. 
 The PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, contains a description of 47 project management 
process in 10 knowledge areas. These 47 processes are placed in 5 process groups—
initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing—to describe the 
stage in the project in which they are best used. Managing a project means taking the 
appropriate process and the tools and techniques associated with it and applying them 
appropriately to the work that needs to be done. Project management, then, is simply 
the application of any of the PMBOK Guide knowledge areas with the goal of delivering a 
product, service, or result. 
 One of the tasks of project management is the balancing of  competing constraints   
on a project. These constraints can be scope, quality, schedule, budget or cost, resources, 
and risk. If any one of these constraints changes, it will likely place additional pressure 
on one or more of the other constraints. For example, if you have to deliver a project in 
a shorter time period, you may need additional budget to complete the work, and your 
known risks may increase while quality decreases. 
 
■ Exam Tip   You should know that one important aspect of project management is 
recognizing and navigating your way through competing constraints on a project. This is 
evident in planning a project and also when considering a request for a change to a project, 
where a request for more time may impact schedule, risk, or quality. 
 An important aspect of project management is that, generally speaking, you 
cannot know everything there is to know about a project at the outset, and, thus, project 
management is highly iterative. This means you may be able to define the work to be 
done for the next few weeks accurately, but beyond that you can’t plan as well because 
there is more uncertainty; so you plan in an iterative manner, meaning you plan many 
times, each time with more information.  Progressive elaboration is an iterative process 
that acknowledges that you will know more, the more you do. For example, at the 
beginning of a software project you may know the general expected outcome and the 
first steps on the path to delivering it, but as you move along in the project you become 
more aware of the magnitude of the work and can plan the project schedule, budget, and 
risks better.  Rolling-wave planning is another type of iterative planning where you plan in 
detail the next appropriate time period; as you keep progressing throughout a project, you 
keep planning that same length of time in detail. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
10
 
■ Exam Tip   If you see the term  progressive elaboration or  rolling-wave planning on 
the exam, it is referring to the concept of knowing more about the project, the more work 
you do.  
 
REAL WORLD
 It is important to let your project stakeholders know that projects are generally 
iterative and subject to progressive elaboration, to counter the expectation that you 
can plan everything at the beginning of a project. 
 Quick Check 
 
 1. 
 How would project management differ from managing an 
ongoing business activity? 
 
 2. 
 How does iterative planning differ from progressive 
elaboration of a project? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 Project management uses the process, tools, and techniques 
of the PMBOK Guide, is subject to multiple interdependent 
constraints, and is subject to iterations and progressive 
elaboration. It is also a temporary endeavor with a defined 
end. An ongoing operational business activity may or may not 
be subject to interdependent constraints, and it does not have 
a defined end.  
 
 2. 
 You can deliberately choose to plan iteratively even with a 
known scope of work. You can decide to focus your detailed 
planning activities on the immediate future and revisit 
the planning stages as the project progresses. Progressive 
elaboration, or rolling-wave planning, implies that not 
everything is known about a project and more will become 
known as the project moves along. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT

 Project Management, Operations Management, 
and Organizational Strategy 
 
■ More Info   Project Management, Operations Management, and Organizational Strategy 
 You can read more about project management, operations management, and organizational 
strategy in the PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, in Chapter 1, section 1.5. 
 As you already know, project management is all about delivering a product, 
service, or result. After this product, service, or result has been delivered as part of the 
entire project work or simply as part of a project phase, it normally gets handed over to 
operational management. Operational management differs from project management 
in that it is a permanent part of any organization and is focused on the ongoing activities 
of the business, whereas project management is focused on the temporary activities 
of project delivery. Operational management also provides the overall strategy for the 
organization, which is used to help select the right projects. 
 Obviously, each area intersects at the point where the deliverable is handed over. 
At this point, the normal operations of the organization may need to change or adapt to 
accommodate the deliverable. This is one role of operational managers. 
 
■ Exam Tip   For the exam, you need to know the difference between operational work 
and project work, and that operational management often takes responsibility for the 
deliverable for the project when it has been completed. 
 
REAL WORLD
 An important tip for any project manager is to include the end users responsible for 
use and maintenance of any deliverable in the list of stakeholders to be consulted. 
They often have real-world experience in the use and ongoing maintenance of the 
deliverable that perhaps the people who design the deliverable don’t. 
 The  business value is the sum of all tangible and intangible values in the 
organization. It can include all capital assets of an organization as well as intangible 
elements such as brand recognition. Organizations strive to increase their business value, 
and they can use project management to help them do this. The successful creation of 
business value is enhanced by having a clear strategy and using the strategy to select 
projects that deliver appropriate business value. In this way, project management can 
contribute to the business value of an organization. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
12
 More specifically, portfolio management selects the projects that align with 
organizational strategy, program management manages interconnected projects, 
and project management delivers unique products, service, and results, all of which 
contribute to greater business value. The creation of business value is the final link in 
the process whereby project management can be seen as a key strategic enabler for a 
business. 
 Project management  and organizational strategy are interrelated insofar as 
organizations achieve strategic goals by delivering successful projects. Although a 
project manager may not be involved in checking strategic alignment of all projects 
prior to approval, they should ensure that any project they are given to manage can be 
mapped back to a strategic goal of the organization. Projects that are not aligned with 
organizational strategy may suffer from lack of political support, and the organization 
may not have the core competencies required to complete the project. 
 
REAL WORLD
 It is important that project managers have a sound understanding of operational 
management objectives so they understand why their projects are important and 
how they fit into the overall organization strategy and add business value. In my own 
career, I have found that a business education has helped my project management, 
and, conversely, my project management experience has helped my operational 
management efforts.

 Organizational Influences on Project 
Management 
 
■ More Info   Organizational Influences 
 You can read more about the organizational influences on project management in the 
PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, in Chapter 2, section 2.1. 
 Projects are not completed in a vacuum, devoid of influence from an organization’s 
culture, style, or structure. It is important for a project manager to recognize that each of 
these elements can positively or negatively influence the outcome of a project. Different 
organizations have different cultures. These cultures can be observed by noting such 
things as the values, beliefs, and expectations held by senior management; any relevant 
policies and procedures that the organization has; the motivation and reward systems; 
its tolerance toward risk; its attitudes toward hierarchy and power and authority 
relationships; and such things as the expected work and work hours. The organizational 
culture is usually established by the founders of the organization, developed by the 
current employees, and perpetuated through ongoing recruitment policies. 
 
REAL WORLD
 Often in the real world you will see organizations that do the same work technically 
but have completely different organizational cultures. I know of several people who 
have left one organization to go to a competitor, only to return in a few months 
because they didn't like the particular organizational culture. 
 In addition to the internal  o rganizational culture founded by recruitment policies 
and current employees, an organization’s culture can also be influenced by the broader 
cultural environment in which it operates. This includes factors such as employment 
market conditions, level of competition, and external political influences. It is up to 
project managers to make sure they assess and understand how these cultural factors 
may impact a project. This creates challenges for the project manager, who must be aware 
of issues around multiculturalism, particularly with the increase of globalization and the 
use of project team members from different countries. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
14
 
■ Exam Tip   Both the organization’s culture and its structure are enterprise environmental 
factors, because they sit outside the direct realm of the project and can assist or constrain 
the project. 
 So far, this chapter has looked at the impact of organizational culture on projects. 
Other important aspects of organizational influence on projects are organizational 
process assets and enterprise environmental factors. 
 Organizational process assets , as the name suggests, are any existing plans, 
procedures, policies, templates, and knowledge bases that the organization owns that 
can be used to assist the project. Organizational process assets appear as inputs into most 
of the 47 planning processes in the PMBOK Guide. Specific examples of organizational 
process assets include the project management methodology, any blank templates, any 
change-control processes and procedures, any financial control reporting requirements, 
any defined communication methods, any standardized approach to risk management 
the organization has, and any project closure guidelines, requirements, or checklists. 
 Enterprise environmental factors are always external to the project but not necessarily 
external to the organization; they are just not under the control of the project team. 
Enterprise environmental factors feature as inputs into most of the 47 planning processes 
in the PMBOK Guide. Specific examples of enterprise environmental factors include the 
organizational culture and structure, any relevant government or industry standards 
that can affect the project, any personnel administration requirements, any external 
marketplace conditions, the stakeholder risk tolerances, the external political climate, 
and any project management information systems, including any software purchased or 
licensed by the organization. Many people assume that project management software is 
an organizational process asset; however, it is generally considered to be an enterprise 
environmental factor because it is usually licensed rather than owned. 
 
REAL WORLD
 The most common form of organizational process asset that most project managers 
encounter is the organization’s project management methodology. A  project 
management methodology itself can mean many things. It can be as simple as a 
range of blank templates available to the project manager; or, at the other end of 
the spectrum, it can be a fully defined set of processes, procedures, templates, and 
databases that must be used for all projects. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
15
 
■ Exam Tip   A general rule of thumb for remembering the difference between 
organizational process assets and enterprise  environmental factors  is that, generally 
speaking, organizational process assets can be used to assist a project, whereas enterprise 
environmental factors often constrain a project. Additionally, as the name suggests, with 
organizational process assets, the organization must own the assets.

 2. 
 A project manager needs to be aware of the overall 
organizational culture and specific elements within it because 
these will affect the projects they are working on. It is best to 
take advantage of those parts of the organizational culture 
that contribute to project success and mitigate those parts of 
the organizational culture that may increase the chances of 
project failure. 
 
 3. 
  The culture of an organization generally reflects the values 
of its founding members and is then perpetuated and 
reproduced by both senior managers and leaders and the 
organization’s recruitment policies. 
 The Project Life Cycle 
 
■ More Info   Project Life Cycle 
 You can read more about the project  life cycle in the PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, in Chapter 2, 
section 2.4. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
16
 The project  life cycle is central to the PMBOK Guide. It forms the basis for the five 
PMBOK Guide process groups. The project life cycle provides a framework and also 
describes the generally sequential activities undertaken in any project, beginning with 
the process of starting or initiating the project, organizing and preparing to do the work 
of the project, then carrying out the defined project work, and finally recognizing the 
closeout of a project. 
 There are three ways to describe typical project life cycles. The first is the  predictive 
life cycle, where a lot of planning work can be done up front and then the work is carried 
out according to this plan with relatively little change. We often see these types of project 
life cycles in the construction industry. 
 The  iterative or  incremental project life cycle features planning and executing work 
being done concurrently (at the same time) to deal with projects where there is a lot of 
change. We see iterative or incremental project life cycles in many types of information 
technology projects. 
 The  adaptive project life cycle is used when there is a great deal of uncertainty; 
it recognizes that very little planning work can be done up front. Highly complex 
information technology projects are good examples of adaptive life cycles. 
 The concept of the project life cycle moving from a project’s beginnings to its closure 
can be applied to an entire project or to the different  phases in the project. Project 
phases are best used when there is a clear and defining milestone between activities. For 
example, a project may have a design phase that requires signoff on the design (which 
would be the milestone) before the project is allowed to proceed to the implementation 
phase. Project phases can be performed in a linear, sequential fashion, with successive 
phases having to wait until a predecessor phase is complete before proceeding. 
Alternatively, phases can overlap, with the successive phase able to start prior to the 
completion of the predecessor phase. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Be prepared to see terms such as  milestone ,  stage gate ,  phase gate ,  kill 
point , and  stop/go point in questions relating to phases of a project. 
 A project management  methodology takes an approach based on the project life 
cycle and perhaps its phases, and describes the processes that will be followed and the 
tools and templates to be used. Most project management methodologies are built on the 
concept of the project life cycle and have different procedures that reflect different parts 
of that life cycle. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
17
 
REAL WORLD
 There are many different types of project management methodologies. They range 
from the highly iterative agile methodologies used in information technology projects 
to the more predictive methodologies also known as  waterfall methodologies, 
where there is a clear linear progression from startup through closure of a project. 
In developing an appropriate project management methodology for an organization, 
consideration must be given to the type of projects, the size of projects, the 
organizational culture, the timeframe for project delivery, and the maturity of the 
organization. The development of a project management methodology is not a one-
size-fits-all proposition. In fact, a good methodology will always be flexible enough 
to accommodate different projects. 
 The concept of the project life cycle incorporating the initiation, planning, execution, 
and closing phases of the project is based on the Shewhart and Deming  Plan-Do-Check-
Act (PDCA) cycle . This cycle starts with making a plan, then doing what you planned, 
then checking that what you are doing is what you planned, then acting if you find any 
variance between what you are doing and what you planned to do, and then going back 
and planning again. Figure  1-3 shows this PDCA cycle.  
 Figure 1-3.    The Shewhart and Deming  Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle showing the iterative 
nature of project management 
 

CHAPTER 1 ■ FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
18
 
■ Exam Tip   Take care to read any questions about life cycles to determine whether 
they are referring to the project life cycle or the product life cycle. The project life cycle 
refers to the project from initiation to closing. The product life cycle refers to the design, 
manufacturing, use, and obsolescence of the product. The product life cycle can be many 
years longer than the project life cycle. 
 The five PMBOK Guide process groups describe work to be done in each of the 
ten specific knowledge areas. Table  1-1 shows how the five process groups and the ten 
knowledge areas from the PMBOK Guide overlap.  
 This cycle forms the basis of the initiating, planning (Plan), executing (Do), 
monitoring and controlling (Check and Act), and closing process groups of the PMBOK 
Guide. Figure  1-4 shows the PMBOK Guide process groups.

■ Exam Tip   Try memorizing this table to help you remember the sequence of processes 
on the exam. An easy way to remember the knowledge areas is to use a mnemonic. My 
favorite, once you remove the word Project from each one, is : In Summer The Cruel Queen 
Hates Cold Runny Porridge Snacks . Notice that the first letter of each word in the sentence 
links to the first letter in each of the knowledge areas. Try making up your own mnemonic. 
If you are a numbers sort of person, try remembering the following number sequence 
2 - 24 - 8 - 11 - 2. Those numbers are the number of processes in the Initiating, Planning, 
Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing process groups, respectively. Another 
set of numbers is 6 - 6 - 7 - 4 - 3 - 4 - 3 - 6 - 4 - 4, which are the numbers of processes in 
each knowledge area from Integration Management through Stakeholder Management.

 Chapter Summary 
• 
  This chapter introduced you to many foundational concepts 
of the PMBOK Guide. It began by looking at the purpose and 
contents of the PMBOK Guide and then went on to define 
a project and the unique characteristics that differentiate 
projects from ongoing or repetitive work. It is important that 
you understand how project work is different from ongoing or 
operational work. 
• 
 The chapter then looked at the differences between and 
the relationships among project management, program 
management, and portfolio management. The link to portfolio 
management also includes consideration of the link between 
projects and strategic planning and how project management can 
be a strategic enabler for an organization. Ultimately, the strategic 
decisions made and the way in which project management can 
support them will deliver increased business value. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
22
• 
 The role of the project management office (PMO) in any 
organization is an important one and reflects the level 
of organizational project management maturity that the 
organization has attained. The primary function of a PMO and 
whether it is supportive, controlling, or directive is a direct 
reflection of the level of maturity of the organization.  
• 
 The role of organizational process assets and enterprise 
environmental factors in the success or failure of project 
management is important. Additionally, organizational process 
assets and enterprise environmental factors feature as inputs in 
many of the 47 processes of the PMBOK Guide.  
• 
 The concept of the project life cycle, which begins with the start 
of a project and moves through the organization, preparation, 
execution of the planned project work, and finally the closing of 
the project, is central to many of the processes and knowledge 
areas in the PMBOK Guide. The concept of the project life cycle 
can also be applied to separate project phases.

 Answers 
 This section contains the answers to the questions for the “Exercises” and “Review 
Questions” in this chapter. 
 Exercises 
 
 1. 
 Consider the following scenarios. For each scenario, decide 
whether it is a project, a program, a portfolio, or ongoing 
work.
 
  A.   The implementation of a new piece of software to run an 
organization’s payroll 
 
  This is an example of a project. 
 
  B.   The construction of a new house 
 
  This is an example of a project. 
 
  C.   The development of a new housing subdivision 
 
   This would generally be seen as either a very large project 
or a program. This demonstrates that there is a grey area 
between projects, programs, and portfolios. 
 
  D.  Filming the first movie of a movie trilogy 
 
   The first movie will be seen as a project; the entire trilogy 
would be seen as a program. 
 
  E.  Increasing sales from the previous year 
 
  This is an example of ongoing work. 
 
  F.  The design phase of a new piece of software 
 
   Because this is a phase, it would best be viewed as part of 
a project. 
 
  G.  The range of projects an organization is undertaking to 
increase market share 
 
   This is an example of a program with a common goal of 
increasing market share. 
 
  H.  The installation of new servers as part of a major upgrade 
to an organization’s software and hardware systems 
 
   This is an example of a project that is part of a broader 
program. 
 
  I.  A new marketing campaign designed to bring in more 
business 
 
   Marketing is generally considered to be an ongoing 
activity rather than a project. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
27
 
  J.  The development of a new product that will increase 
operational profit 
 
   This is an example of a project that will be handed over to 
the operations side of the organization.  
 
  K.  Several different pieces of software being developed that 
use the same developers 
 
   Merely using the same developers doesn’t mean that 
these projects are part of a program. Instead, they should 
be considered individual projects that are part of a 
portfolio. 
 
  L.  All the new house projects being undertaken by a 
construction company 
 
  This is an example of a portfolio of projects.

 2. 
 Correct Answer: B 
 
 A.  Incorrect: The PMBOK Guide does not provide a 
methodology. You are able to build a methodology from 
the contents of the PMBOK Guide via the process of 
tailoring. 
 
 B.  Correct: The PMBOK Guide collects and presents what 
is generally considered to be good practice across a wide 
range of industries and presents this information as a

 C.  Incorrect: The PMBOK Guide emphasizes in several 
places that, through the process of tailoring, you should 
only take from the PMBOK Guide what is appropriate to 
your project. 
 
 D.  Incorrect: The PMBOK Guide does not claim to present 
all known project management information, only that 
which is generally considered good practice across a wide

 3. 
 Correct Answer: A 
 
 A.  Correct: Rolling-wave planning acknowledges that you 
will iteratively plan the project as you move along the 
project life cycle. 
 
 B.  Incorrect: Only planning the first phase of a project is 
typical for phased projects, because there may be an 
important milestone between phases that prevents further 
planning.

31
 
 C.  Incorrect : Planning the entire project before starting is a 
very rare occurrence and probably only suitable for small, 
easily defined projects. 
 
 D.  Incorrect: Iteratively planning a phase of a project is not 
an example of rolling-wave planning. 
 
 4. 
 Correct Answer: B 
 
 A.  Incorrect: There is a strong relationship between 
successful projects and an organization achieving its 
strategic goals. 
 
 B.  Correct: By selecting projects that deliver strategic 
goals and then successfully delivering these projects, an 
organization can achieve its strategic goals.

project management maturity. 
 
 B.  Incorrect: Controlling project management offices 
are generally a sign of an organization improving its 
organizational project management maturity. 
 
 C.  Correct: Supportive project management offices are 
generally a sign of a low level of project management 
maturity, because they do not support a lot of complexity. 
 
 D.  Incorrect: This is a made-up term and is not from the 
PMBOK Guide. 
 
 6. 
 Correct Answer: C 
 
 A.  Incorrect: Multi projects is a made-up term that does not 
describe a coordinated approach to interrelated projects. 
 
 B.  Incorrect: Portfolios are groups of projects related only 
by the fact that they are being performed by a single 
organization. 
 
 C.  Correct: A program is a group of projects that are related 
in some way and that are managed to achieve benefits not 
gained by managing them independently. 
 
 D.  Incorrect: Strategy is the organization’s future direction 
and how it is going to achieve this.

Chapter 2
Integration Management
This chapter focuses on project integration management. Project Integration 
Management recognizes that no part of the profession of project management acts in 
isolation, and in fact there is a high degree of interdependency between different parts 
of the profession. As such, a lot of the information discussed in this chapter reaches 
across many other knowledge areas in the profession. In addition to recognizing the 
interdependency of all other knowledge areas, project integration management also 
specifically addresses those activities, such as change control processes, which are 
carried out over more than one knowledge area.
The PMBOK® Guide Processes
Project Integration Management Knowledge Area
The six processes in the Project Integration Management knowledge area are as 
follows:
• 
Develop Project Charter (Initiating process)
• 
Develop Project Management Plan (Planning process)
• 
Direct and Manage Project Work (Executing process)
• 
Monitor and Control Project Work (Monitoring and Controlling 
process)
• 
Perform Integrated Change Control (Monitoring and Controlling 
process)
• 
Close Project or Phase (Closing process)
What Is Project Integration Management?
The other nine knowledge areas in the PMBOK Guide focus on a specific knowledge 
area and have key inputs from, and provide outputs for, other knowledge areas. Project 
Integration Management is the only knowledge area that actually works across all the 
other knowledge areas. It has been described as the forest whereas the other knowledge 
areas are the trees. It is very much a coordination process that recognizes that none 
of the PMBOK Guide knowledge areas are isolated and discrete. Project Integration 
Management recognizes that the knowledge areas are all interdependent and rely on 

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
36
each other to a greater or lesser extent. They are also able to affect each other; as such, 
when defining, planning, executing, and controlling the project, a project manager 
must recognize this and take an integrated point of view. This is true of activity between 
knowledge areas and also between processes in the same knowledge area. They can also 
be highly iterative and are not necessarily a direct linear progression from one process to 
another.
For example, when preparing a cost estimate, you need to have a defined project 
scope and also be aware of resources available, risks, and any other factors from the other 
knowledge areas that may affect the cost estimate. If you consider each knowledge area 
as a separate and discrete activity, then developing cost estimates in isolation would 
result in highly inaccurate estimates. Project Integration Management reminds us that all 
knowledge areas and processes are connected.
The Project Integration Management knowledge area produces the project charter 
(Develop Project Charter), which is a foundational document for the project and most of 
the other processes. It also delivers the project management plan in its many iterations 
(Develop Project Management Plan), takes a coordinated and high-level view of all the 
work being done on the project to achieve the plans (Direct and Manage Project Work), 
checks the project progress (Monitor and Control Project Work), and assesses, influences, 
and controls changes as they occur (Perform Integrated Change Control). In addition to 
providing the foundational documents that initiate the project, this knowledge area also 
manages the closure of the project or a phase in a project (Close Project or Phase).
Additionally, the Project Integration Management knowledge area reinforces the 
fact that there are many successful ways to manage a project. Projects vary considerably 
in terms of depth, complexity, size, industry, and deliverables. As such, the level of 
interaction between selected processes is also different. The process called tailoring 
involves selecting those processes that are appropriate to a project and ensuring 
throughout the life of the project that constant checking is done to ensure that the 
selected processes and their application are still appropriate. Having broad oversight of 
the project via the Project Integration Management knowledge area helps in selecting the 
right processes and applying them appropriately.
REAL WORLD
I am a big advocate of tailoring tools, techniques, and processes to appropriately 
fit your organization and your project. All sorts of potential problems can arise 
from applying too many, or too few, project management practices to a project. 
Take the time at the beginning of the project to choose those processes, tools, and 
techniques that will actually add value to your project, and throughout the life of the 
project be prepared to reexamine your decisions to ensure that they are still correct. 
For example, during one small IT project I worked on, our project management 
methodology was tailored to be flexible and very simple because the project was 
simple and took place over a short time frame. A larger IT project I worked on had 
a very rigid methodology with many processes, reflecting the complexity of the 
project.

■Exam Tip  A high proportion of questions on the PMP exam expect you to know how one 
process or knowledge area interacts with, or is dependent on, other processes or knowledge 
areas. Do not be surprised if you have to read a question several times to determine exactly 
how many, and which, processes it is referring to. You should also get used to looking not 
just at the entire process, but also at the way in which inputs become outputs with the 
application of selected tools and techniques.
Develop Project Charter

■More Info  Develop Project Charter
You can read more about the Develop Project Charter process in the PMBOK Guide, 
5th edition, in Chapter 4, section 4.1. Table 2-1 identifies the process inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs.

The Develop Project Charter process is an initiating process with a single output—
not surprisingly, given the name of the process, it is the project charter. The Develop 
Project Charter process is one of only two initiating processes in the PMBOK Guide.
Domain Task Alignment
The Develop Project Charter process covers the following eight initiating domain 
tasks:
• 
Task 1: Perform project assessment based on available 
information, lessons learned from previous projects, and 
meetings with relevant stakeholders, in order to support the 
evaluation of the feasibility of new products or services in the 
given assumptions and/or constraints.
• 
Task 2: Identify key deliverables based on the business 
requirements, in order to manage customer expectations and 
direct the achievement of project goals.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
38
• 
Task 4: Identify high-level risks, assumptions, and constraints 
based on the current environment, organizational factors, 
historical data, and expert judgment, in order to propose an 
implementation strategy.
• 
Task 5: Participate in the development of the project charter by 
compiling and analyzing gathered information, in order to ensure 
that project stakeholders are in agreement on its elements.
• 
Task 6: Obtain project charter approval from the sponsor, in order 
to formalize the authority assigned to the project manager and 
gain commitment and acceptance for the project.
• 
Task 7: Conduct benefit analysis with stakeholders (including 
sponsor, customer, and subject matter experts), in order to 
validate project alignment with organizational strategy and 
expected business value.
• 
Task 8: Inform stakeholders of the approved project charter, in 
order to ensure common understanding of the key deliverables, 
milestones, and their roles and responsibilities.
It is the first process to be completed and the one that kicks off a project. Unlike 
most of the other processes in the PMBOK Guide, the Develop Project Charter process 
features inputs that are not outputs from other processes. In this case, the inputs come 
from either the project sponsor (for example, any contracts or agreements, a business 
case, or the known project statement of work) or the organization or the environment 
in which the project must work and is constrained by (enterprise environmental factors 
and organizational process assets). The project sponsor is critical to this process, because 
the sponsor takes responsibility not only for providing some necessary inputs into this 
process but also for initiating and signing off on the development of the project charter.
The project manager may not always be directly responsible for preparation of the 
project charter. In a perfect world, they would be, but they are often handed a completed 
project charter and expected to then complete detailed planning.
■
■Exam Tip  The Develop Project Charter process is one of two initiating processes in 
the PMBOK Guide. The other is the Identify Stakeholders process from Project Stakeholder 
Identification Management. Because the project charter is an input into the Identify 
Stakeholders process, it must be done first.
Broadly speaking, many of the inputs used in this process are part of a project-
selection process that assesses any potential project against the organizational strategic 
goals and also against financial and non-financial criteria to help the organization make 
decisions about which projects it will undertake and which it won’t. Understanding 
this process will assist your understanding of the Develop Project Charter process. Only 
projects that are of a compliance nature, or emergency works, should be able to bypass 
this project-selection process, which is illustrated in Figure 2-1. Examples of compliance 

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
39
projects are those that are necessitated when legal reporting requirements are changed 
and your organization must comply with them, even though there is no business value in 
doing so. An example of emergency work could be the work you must do after a natural 
disaster strikes, to get your organization up and running again. There is not time to go 
through a formal process to justify these types of projects.
Figure 2-1.  Project-selection process
Figure 2-1 shows that after an organization has identified all the potential projects it 
could undertake, it must put each project through a series of filters and criteria to enable 
it to choose the ones it will undertake. From this approved portfolio of projects, it can then 
prioritize them and begin to develop a project charter. The first step in this selection process 
is for an organization to only choose those projects that align with and deliver its strategic 
goals. This is because they will help an organization stay in business and meets its goals, 
and also because those strategic goals represent the organization’s core competencies.
REAL WORLD
The profession of project management is seen as a critical strategic enabler for 
organizations. This is because most organizations seek to deliver their strategic 
goals, and therefore the success or failure of the projects undertaken is a critical 
indicator of whether organizations will achieve their strategic goals.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
40
After a project has been confirmed as meeting the strategic goals of an organization, 
it may go through either financial or non-financial criteria processes, or both, that 
either deny or further refine and approve projects that will be undertaken as part of the 
organization’s approved portfolio of projects. This is usually done during the preparation 
of a business case.
The following list describes the most common financial criteria that can be used to 
determine which projects are suitable:
• 
Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR)  A ratio that looks at the financially 
quantifiable benefits expected from the project and weighs 
them against the cost of achieving those benefits. If the benefits 
outweigh the costs, then the project can be given the go-ahead.
• 
Economic Value Add (EVA)  The profit earned by the 
organization after the cost of capital has been subtracted. Many 
organizations set a target for this and only approve projects that 
meet or exceed this target.
• 
Internal Rate of Return (IRR)  The rate of return after external 
factors affecting cash flow (for example, interest or cost of capital, 
and inflation) have been deducted. The higher the IRR, the better 
the project.
• 
Present Value (PV)  The value of future cash flows in today’s 
dollars. The formula for calculating PV is
PV
FV
r
n
=
+
(
)
1
where FV equals the future value of cash flows, r equals the 
interest rate, and n equals the number of time periods.
• 
Net Present Value (NPV)  The value in today’s dollars of 
future benefits minus the costs to achieve the benefits. The 
organization’s own discount rate is applied to future cash flows 
to calculate today’s value. A positive NPV is good, whereas a 
negative NPV is bad. NPV is calculated by subtracting the PV 
of costs from the PV of income and is the sum of all the PV 
calculations for income generated for a particular time period, 
subtracted from the initial spend on the project. To calculate NPV, 
simply add up all the PV calculations for the expected income and 
then subtract this PV from the initial spend. The formula is
NPV = Initial Outlay + Year 1 Income  
+
Year 2 Income  
+
Year 3 Income  
+
Year 4 Income
(1 + r)
(1 + r)2
(1 + r)3
(1 + r)4

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
41
For example, if your project had an initial spend of $100,000 and was supposed to 
generate income of $30,000 in the first year, $35,000 in the second year, $37,000 in the 
third year, and $39,000 in the fourth year with a discount or interest rate of 10%, the NPV 
of the project would be $10,634.52.
• 
Opportunity Cost  The cost of not doing other projects and the 
profit, or financial surplus, they would bring the organization.
• 
Payback Period  The time taken to pay back the investment in 
the project. An organization may set a required Payback Period, 
such as five years, within which time the project must pay back 
the original investment. Payback Period is calculated by dividing 
the initial investment by the projected annual income.
• 
Return on Investment (ROI)  The cost of a project subtracted 
from dollar gains on a project, divided by the cost of the project, 
expressed as a percentage. An organization sets criteria specifying 
that a ROI must first be positive, and the higher the ROI the better. 
Often organizations also specify that the ROI must be greater than 
bank interest rates to reflect the risk in a project. Otherwise, from 
a commercial point of view, the organization is better off putting 
its money in a bank.
• 
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)  Used to describe in 
percentage terms how well an organization is using its money, or 
capital, on its projects. Positive is good, and the higher the better 
when it comes to selecting projects.
• 
Future Value (FV)  Used to calculate the future value of an asset 
with a known interest rate to measure accumulation of value  
over time.
■
■Exam Tip  If you find linear programming or non-linear programming referred to in an 
exam question, the question is referring to a constrained optimization method for project 
selection. This is a complex mathematical process of maximizing the cost function of any 
calculation. The other category you will find is the benefit-measurement model, in which an 
organization seeks to compare benefits and features of a particular proposal and make the 
selection on that basis.
Inputs
The Develop Project Charter process uses some or all of the following inputs as part of the 
development of the project charter for the project.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
42
Project Statement of Work
The project statement of work (SOW) is a high-level narrative description of the work to 
be done on a project. It reflects what is known about the project work at the early stage 
of initiating a project. The project SOW describes the known scope of work, the business 
needs, and the product or service to be delivered. The SOW may also refer to the ways 
in which the project aligns with and delivers the organization’s strategic goals. It may 
also contain information about known milestones and project constraints, as well as any 
preliminary budget and time estimates. In the absence of this information during this 
initiating process, the SOW may describe the work to be done to develop these estimates.
If you are using a SOW, then it leaves room for further definition of the project scope 
but gives enough information to authorize the project and do a preliminary assessment 
of time, cost, and other relevant factors. If a project is based on a signed contract or 
agreement, then the SOW is replaced by the project scope contained in the contract, 
which tends to be much more detailed in its description of the work to be done.
■
■Exam Tip  The SOW is a primary input into the Develop Project Charter process but 
not a mandatory one. If a business case has been developed, or a fully defined contract or 
agreement is available, then there is no need for a SOW.
Business Case
A business case can be used as an input into the project charter or even as a project 
charter itself. Typically, the business case examines the financial and non-financial 
criteria that are used to assess whether the organization will commit to the project. These 
criteria are best used against a predefined expectation of what constitutes an acceptable 
project. For example, an organization might require a project to deliver a certain level of 
ROI or a certain percentage of increase in market share before approving it. Projects that 
don’t deliver these defined metrics are not considered for approval. These predefined 
metrics can also be further used to prioritize which projects are done first, with the 
project scoring better being done first. These financial criteria were discussed in greater 
detail earlier in the chapter.
■
■Exam Tip  Assume that all projects must go through a rigorous and defined business 
case process prior to approval. This process considers strategic alignment and financial and 
non-financial matters, which are all captured in the business case.
The business case also looks at any predefined non-financial criteria that the 
organization wishes to consider. Examples of non-financial criteria an organization 
may consider are projects that increase market share, those that make it difficult for 
competitors to enter the market, projects that reduce dependencies on suppliers, and 
projects focused on delivering social, environmental, health, or educational benefits.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
43
If the project is being executed in several phases with milestones between each 
phase, the business case can be revisited at these points to ensure that it is both still valid 
and delivering the expected outcomes.
A business case usually includes most of the following elements:
• 
A description of the forecast or actual market demand for the 
product or service
• 
A description the organizational need for the project
• 
If it is for an external client, a description of the customer request
• 
A description of any technical advances that are presenting the 
opportunity to undertake the project
• 
Any legal or compliance requirements that are being addressed 
and met as a result of the project
• 
Any ecological or natural environmental impacts
• 
A description of the social need being fulfilled by the project
Clearly, the business case can be a very comprehensive document. If the project is 
large and complex, then the business case should reflect this. However, if the project is 
relatively simple and straightforward, the business case can be less complex.
Agreements
The project charter can be based on any type of agreement between a performing 
organization and a requesting organization, or customer. An agreement can take the form 
of a signed contract, which in turn may be the result of a procurement process run by an 
external organization as part of its own project processes. The agreement may also be in 
the form of a memorandum of understanding (MOU), letter of agreement, or heads of 
agreement. An exchange of email messages with an offer and acceptance is also a form of 
valid agreement. A valid agreement can also be formed via a verbal exchange, in which 
case you should document the exchange as part of the project charter process.
If an agreement with an external party is used as an input into the Develop Project 
Charter process, the external party should be able to review and agree to the eventual 
project charter as it relates to them. This does not mean they need to view the entire 
project charter, because there may be commercially sensitive information contained 
within it, but they should have the opportunity to comment on and agree to the content 
that relates to any agreement between the parties.
■
■Note   Verbal Agreements
Projects that are undertaken with a simple verbal agreement must document the agreement 
at some point to ensure that all parties understand and agree to what was talked about and 
to ensure that everyone’s expectations are recorded and communicated. This is best done 
during the Develop Project Charter process before any planning work is done.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
44
Enterprise Environmental Factors
Enterprise environmental factors are some of the most common inputs used throughout 
the PMBOK Guide. They can refer to many separate and distinct factors that can affect, 
and be used as inputs to, projects. In the Develop Project Charter process, the specific 
enterprise environmental factors that can influence the project charter development are 
any relevant government or industry standards that the project must comply with, any 
organizational infrastructure issues or constraints, and any known or forecast market 
conditions affecting the project selection process.
■
■Exam Tip  Enterprise environmental factors are some of the most widely used inputs 
throughout the PMBOK Guide. The term covers a lot of different factors that can influence 
a project. The environment referred to is not the ecological environment: it is the financial 
and human resource market environment, the legislative and legal environment, and the 
innovation and competitive environment, and it also includes external cultural factors. Take 
time to understand the variety of factors that are enterprise environmental factors and 
be able to differentiate them from organizational process assets. Very broadly, enterprise 
environmental factors can be considered as constraining the project, whereas organizational 
process assets can be considered as assisting the project.
Organizational Process Assets
An organizational process asset is any concept, process, or structure documented by the 
organization for use in project management. For the Develop Project Charter process, the 
relevant organizational process assets include any organizational processes relating to the 
project selection, business cases, and development of the project charter, including any 
templates the organization may have. It also includes any existing project management 
methodology the organization has. Organizational process assets that are useful in 
the initiation phase and the development of the project charter also include historical 
information and lessons learned from previous projects.
■
■Exam Tip  The PMBOK Guide places a large emphasis on the importance of gathering 
and referring to historical information and lessons learned. You should always assume 
that this is done and available to you as a project manager. You should always assume 
that you will contribute to the development of an organization’s historical information and 
lessons-learned database as part of the project management activities completed on your 
project. This is an extremely important part of a closeout process and should be part of your 
closure checklist. You should look to complete closeout interviews and meetings with all 
stakeholders, complete post-implementation reviews, and also complete benefits-realization 
analysis to measure whether the intended benefits were achieved. All of this information 
becomes valuable lessons learned and historical information for future projects.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
45
Tools and Techniques
The following tools and techniques are available to be used to develop the inputs into this 
process in order to produce the project charter.
Expert Judgment
Expert judgment is the most often-used tool in the PMBOK Guide. Using expert judgment 
to help you use and optimize the inputs in the process allows you to consult with and seek 
guidance from any person or group who you consider can contribute to the process. This 
expertise may come from within your organization, from individuals, or from the Project 
Management Office (PMO). You may also choose to seek expert judgment from external 
consultants, competitors, and trade associations with expertise in the particular area you 
need guidance on. For example, you may seek guidance from experts in financial analysis 
as part of the business case.
The client or customer is also a valuable source of expert judgment, because they 
have clear expectations and experience with the product or service being delivered. 
Professional organizations, such as the Project Management Institute, may be consulted, 
as well as industry groups and subject matter experts.
Facilitation Techniques
The purpose of facilitation techniques is to solicit information from team members and 
other key stakeholders who have a contribution to make in terms of using the process 
inputs and providing advice or further information to enable you to develop the project 
charter. Many facilitation techniques can be used; the most relevant for the Develop 
Project Charter process are as follows:
• 
Brainstorming  This involves holding structured workshops 
or sessions where participants are encouraged to think broadly 
about every possible action or consequence, no matter how 
strange it may seem. A process of elimination is then used to get 
to those ideas that are most useful.
• 
Conflict resolution  This uses a variety of techniques to ensure 
that any conflict of opinions between experts does not derail the 
process. Conflict resolution includes problem-solving techniques 
that use a wide variety of methods to directly address and 
permanently resolve any problems that arise.
• 
Effective meeting management  Getting your experts together 
and getting the best from them requires effective meeting-
management techniques that include structured and purposeful 
meetings with defined outcomes.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
46
Outputs
After applying the appropriate tools and techniques to the selected inputs, the Develop 
Project Charter process has the following output.
Project Charter
The Develop Project Charter process has only a single output—the project charter. The 
project charter is the foundational document for a project and is like the project’s birth 
certificate. It proves the project exists and has financial and political support from the 
organization and, if applicable, an external client. It should be issued once the project has 
been through an appropriate project-selection process.
The project charter authorizes the initial spend; defines the scope of work known 
at that time; lists any known constraints, risks, and milestones; and also identifies and 
authorizes the project manager and project sponsor. Ideally, the project manager is 
identified and authorized in the project charter and assists with its development; but 
if not, the project manager should definitely be identified before any of the project-
planning processes begin.
Because the project charter is the foundational document for the project, changing 
it requires significant consideration and should not be done unless there are serious 
reasons. For this reason, it can be left broad enough to allow the normal process of 
change control to take place through the project without having to constantly change 
the project charter. Any potential changes to the project charter must be referred to the 
project sponsor.
Not all project charters are created equal, and the size and complexity of the 
project determines the size and complexity of the project charter. Additionally, if 
not much is known about the project, the charter may be big enough to authorize an 
investigation phase that is part of an iterative planning process. If the scope of the 
project is well known, the project charter may be a one-off—that is, a complete and 
complex business case. 
■
■Note   Project Charter
The foundational document for a project is the project charter. Although in a perfect world 
it would probably be called a project charter by everyone involved in project management, 
you may call it by other names, such as project mandate, business case, or work order. 
Remember, though, during the exam you must use the PMBOK Guide terminology.
■
■Exam Tip  Always assume that a project has a project charter of some sort and that you 
will refer to it when seeking answers to why the project exists and what its original goals were.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
47
The project charter is then a key input into the following processes, all of which are 
planning processes:
• 
Plan Scope Management
• 
Collect Requirements
• 
Define Scope
• 
Plan Schedule Management
• 
Plan Cost Management
• 
Plan Risk Management
• 
Identify Stakeholders
Develop Project Management Plan
■
■More Info  Develop Project Management Plan
You can read more about the Develop Project Management Plan process in the PMBOK 
Guide, 5th edition, in Chapter 4, section 4.2. Table 2-2 identifies the process inputs, tools 
and techniques, and outputs.

The Develop Project Management Plan process is a planning process that initiates 
and encompasses the planning activities of all the other knowledge areas. It is the only 
planning process for the Project Integration Management knowledge area, and one of 24 
planning processes in total.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
48
The Develop Project Management Plan process covers the broad range of work 
covered in other planning domain tasks but specifically includes the following planning 
domain tasks:
• 
Task 9: Develop the change management plan by defining how 
changes will be addressed and controlled, in order to track and 
manage change.
• 
Task 11: Present the project management plan to the relevant 
stakeholders according to applicable policies and procedures, in 
order to obtain approval to proceed with project execution.
• 
Task 12: Conduct a kick-off meeting, communicating the start of 
the project, key milestones, and other relevant information, in 
order to inform and engage stakeholders and gain commitment.
The project management plan itself is a document made up of all the other plans, 
and it provides a centralized means of planning your project. It does not necessarily have 
to be contained in a single document, because different formats, such as word processing, 
spreadsheets, project management software, and other formats can be used to develop 
and record the different plans. The Develop Project Management Plan process is a highly 
iterative process that may start with blank templates that eventually become the project 
management plan for a project.
The primary purpose of this process is to record and document how your project is 
going to be executed, monitored and controlled, and closed. As such, it should contain 
plans for each of these elements in the relevant knowledge areas. When your project is 
underway, you can use the project management plan that has been developed to ensure 
that progress is as per the plan and act accordingly if there is a variance.
REAL WORLD
I have worked for organizations that have a single template for their project 
management plan: it has sections that need to be filled out and guidance as to 
how to do so. However, I have also worked for organizations for whom the project 
management plan was a series of disparate documents held in both hard and 
electronic document versions; when viewed together, they formed a consolidated 
plan for managing the project. It is important that a project management plan reflect 
the complexity, size, and industry of the project. Too small a project management 
plan for a large, complex project increases the chances of project failure. On the 
other hand, too large a project management plan for a simple project also increases 
the chances of project failure.
Inputs
The development of the project management plan uses some or all of the following four 
inputs.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
49
Project Charter
The project charter is an output from the Develop Project Charter process. It can take 
many forms, depending on the size and complexity of a project. It acts as the starting 
point that authorizes and guides the development of the project management plan, 
because it contains the known description of the work to be done and any assumptions, 
constraints, and milestones.
Outputs from Other Processes
The Develop Project Management Plan process is an iterative process and uses many of 
the outputs from other knowledge areas as inputs.
■
■Exam Tip  Take note of outputs from other planning, executing, monitoring and 
controlling, and closing processes for project management plan updates that indicate that 
they will be used as inputs into the Develop Project Management Plan process.
These outputs include, but are not limited to, the successive iterations of the 
following:
• 
The requirements management plan
• 
The requirements documentation
• 
The schedule management plan
• 
The schedule baseline
• 
The cost management plan
• 
The cost baseline
• 
The quality management plan
• 
The process improvement plan
• 
The human resource plan
• 
The staffing management plan
• 
The communications management plan
• 
The risk management plan
• 
The procurement management plan
• 
The stakeholder management plan

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
50
Enterprise Environmental Factors
Enterprise environmental factors are both external and internal factors outside the realm 
of the project that a project manager does not have control over but that can influence 
the processes in a project. Specific enterprise environmental factors that can be used as 
inputs to aid the development of the project management plan may include the following:
• 
Any relevant government standards, such as mandatory 
compliance standards.
• 
Any relevant industry standards that the project must comply 
with.
• 
Any software being used as part of the project management 
information systems to develop any aspect of the project 
management plan. Software is considered an external factor 
because it is generally licensed from a third party.
• 
The organizational culture and structure of all organizations 
involved in the project. Organizational culture in terms of 
acceptable behaviors, attitudes toward risk, the amount of power 
and authority the project manager has, and a flat versus tall 
organizational structure are some of the external factors that can 
affect how a project management plan is developed.
• 
Any internal organization policies for the recruitment and release 
of staff.
Organizational Process Assets
Organizational process assets are a very common input into many processes. It is also 
worth remembering that several processes have organizational process asset updates as 
outputs. The specific organizational process assets that can be used as inputs into the 
Develop Project Management Plan process include the following:
• 
Any standard templates or checklists the organization has. For 
example, it may have a blank template for some or all of the 
content of a project management plan or a checklist for project 
closure.
• 
Any processes or project management methodology the 
organization has that defines when, how, and by whom the 
project management plan is put together.
• 
Any predefined change-control procedures and levels of 
delegated authority the project manager and team have.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
51
• 
The organization’s standard configuration management system 
that defines how different versions of documents are recorded, 
controlled, and updated. This is particularly important to 
ensure that you are always working on the correct version of any 
document in what can be a highly iterative process.
• 
Any historical information from past projects that can be used to 
assist in the compilation of the current project management plan.
■
■Exam Tip  The PMBOK Guide places a great deal of importance on the value of historical 
information, particularly lessons learned. Even if you work for an organization that does 
not currently collect historical information about projects, you must remember that it is 
considered one of the most valuable organizational process assets in project management.
Tools and Techniques
The following two tools and techniques are used on the inputs to deliver the project 
management plan.
Expert Judgment
Expert judgment is a great tool to use, and it is used several times as a tool to help 
take inputs and use them correctly and wisely in order to generate the outputs from a 
particular process. The experts providing the judgment can come from any source that 
is relevant to the needs at hand and can include you as project manager as well. In this 
instance, when you are developing the project management plan, expert judgment can 
first be used to tailor the processes that are applicable and useful to the development 
of your particular project management plan. You can also use expert judgment during 
successive iterations of the development of the project management plan to determine 
whether the inputs are still valid and applicable.
Expert judgment can also be used to help evaluate any other aspect of the inputs 
into this process, particularly the outputs from other processes. Because of the large 
number of outputs from other processes that can be used as inputs into the Develop 
Project Management Plan process, you may end up using several experts with skills and 
experience in different areas.

REAL WORLD
During my career as a project manager, I have made repeated and frequent use 
of experts with knowledge greater than my own. Not only does it assist with a 
better output, but it is also a great way to learn. Don’t hesitate to gather around you 
experts who can help you with any aspect of project management. Additionally, don’t 
discount your own experience when it comes to providing an expert opinion.
Facilitation Techniques
Facilitation techniques are used to gather information from individuals or groups of 
people in a constructive way that produces positive outcomes for your project. As the 
name suggests, they are means of facilitating information gathering from people. It 
is up to you as project manager to initiate, define, and lead many of these facilitation 
techniques. Depending on whether they are useful to you at this point, you may wish to 
consider using some or all the following facilitation techniques to help you make sense of, 
develop, redefine, and use the inputs into this process:
• 
Brainstorming  This involves gathering people together in 
a room and asking them to think about all possible ideas. The 
ideas can be as wide and as varied as possible with no limitation 
placed on the brainstorming process. After all possible options, 
no matter how seemingly irrelevant, have been gathered, you can 
then go through a process of refining them.
• 
Conflict-resolution techniques  These are important because 
dysfunctional conflict needs to be addressed promptly and 
dealt with and not swept under the carpet. The other element is 
using conflict to generate healthy debate, which often results in 
a more thought-out and considered end result. Problem solving, 
collaborating, compromise, smoothing, forcing, and withdrawing 
are all examples of conflict-resolution techniques.
• 
Productive and effective meetings  Meetings are also an 
excellent example of facilitation techniques. The use of and 
adherence to a clear agenda, rules for participants, and clear 
minutes and action points will greatly assist in gathering 
information relevant to the development of the project 
management plan.
Outputs
The Develop Project Management Plan process produces the following output.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
53
Project Management Plan
There is only a single output from the Develop Project Management Plan process, and 
that is the project management plan in all of its many iterations. The project management 
plan can be many different things to many different people, depending on the project 
management maturity of the organization, the size and complexity of its projects, 
and the industry it is working in. The plan can be a single document or a collection 
of many documents in different formats. A mature organization will have established 
organizational process assets that help the project manager complete the project 
management plan.
■
■Exam Tip  The project management plan is not a Gantt chart. It is not uncommon 
for people to think that the Gantt chart is the project management plan, but it is simply a 
scheduling and a communications tool.
The content and depth of the project management plan reflect what is known 
about the project at that time, because you can only plan what is known. As such, 
the development of the project management plan is a great example of progressive 
elaboration and rolling-wave planning on a lot of projects. The project management plan 
can contain all or some of the following plans and baselines:
• 
The change-control process
• 
The requirements management plan
• 
The requirements documentation
• 
The schedule management plan
• 
The schedule baseline and milestone list
• 
The cost management plan
• 
The cost baseline
• 
The quality management plan
• 
The process improvement plan
• 
The human resource plan
•

• 
The communications management plan
•

• 
The risk register
• 
The procurement management plan
• 
The stakeholder management plan

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
54
REAL WORLD
When putting together a project management plan, I always make sure it is 
appropriate to the size and complexity of the project I am working on. I also 
recognize that it is a highly iterative process and you can only plan for those parts of 
the project you can define. This means parts of the project off in the distance of time 
may not be able to be planned as well as parts of the project to be completed in the 
short term. It is important to communicate this well to stakeholders, who may think 
it is possible to plan a long-term project in its entirety.
Despite being a singular output, the project management plan is used, either in 
its entirety or in its component parts and subset plans, as an input into many other 
processes throughout the PMBOK Guide. The project management plan is a key input 
into the following processes:
• 
Direct and Manage Project Work
• 
Monitor and Control Project Work
• 
Perform Integrated Change Control
•

The Direct and Manage Project Work process is an executing process. It is one of six 
processes in the Project Integration Management knowledge area, and one of a total of 
eight executing processes in the PMBOK Guide.
The Direct and Manage Project Work process covers the following executing domain 
tasks:
• 
Task 2: Manage task execution based on the project management 
plan by leading and developing the project team, in order to 
achieve project deliverables.
• 
Task 4: Implement approved changes and corrective actions by 
following the change management plan, in order to meet project 
requirements.
• 
Task 5: Implement approved actions by following the risk 
management plan, in order to minimize the impact of the risks 
and take advantage of opportunities on the project.
The main focus of the Direct and Manage Project Work process is doing instead of 
planning, which means the execution and completion of the work on the project and the 
product, or deliverable, you have planned to do. This is why you do all that planning, so 
when it comes time to start doing work you know what to do.
There are three main components of the Direct and Manage Project Work process, 
each focused on a slightly different area of project execution. The first and probably 
largest area is the implementation of the project plans you have made that specify 
both project and product requirements. The second area of focus for this process is the 
iterative process whereby you must repair any defects discovered in deliverables in the 
Monitoring and Controlling processes. The third area is the focus on implementation of 
any approved changes. As you can see, they all involve doing something.
■
■Exam Tip  This process focuses on all the work that has to be done on the project and 
product, and the integration and interdependencies between all the executing processes. 
The other executing processes deal specifically with the execution of the quality, human 
resources, communications, procurement, and stakeholder management plans.
The role of the project manager is extremely important in this process and all the 
executing processes because, along with the rest of the project team members, the 
manager is responsible for the execution of the plans. The primary focus of this process is 
the production of deliverables. The Direct and Manage Project Work process is also where 
any approved changes are implemented.
Inputs
The inputs used in this process reflect its focus on doing the work that was planned and 
also implementing any approved change requests.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
57
Project Management Plan
The project management plan is the primary input here for obvious reasons. Obviously, 
you can’t execute any project or product work without a proper plan to work to. You can, 
however, start work without the project management plan being entirely complete due to 
the iterative nature of the executing process and of the profession of project management 
generally. You can start work on just those areas you have planned while other areas are 
still being planned.
REAL WORLD
I remember being new to the profession of project management and thinking it was 
better just to get on with the job and that planning was a negative outcome on a 
cost-benefit analysis. It was with the wisdom gained with experience (and mistakes) 
that I learned that proper planning precedes execution, resulting in a much greater 
chance of project success.
Approved Change Requests
The Direct and Manage Project Work process is not just about executing the project and 
product work detailed in the plans you have prepared. It is also about carrying out the 
work required as a result of approved changes. As such, approved change requests are an 
important input, because they describe the work to be done. Approved change requests 
can include a requirement for corrective action, a preventive action, or a defect repair. 
Approved change requests are an output from the Perform Integrated Change Control 
process.
Enterprise Environmental Factors
The specific enterprise environmental factors that can influence or constrain this 
particular process are any organizational culture or structure that affects the timing, 
commitment, and support for the execution process. Other factors that also influence 
or constrain the speed, timing, and execution of the plans prepared include decisions 
around project personnel and risk tolerances for stakeholders within and outside the 
performing organization. Access to adequate and appropriate project management 
information systems also affects this process.
Organizational Process Assets
By now you will have figured out how often organizational process assets appear as a 
process input. For this process, the specific organizational process assets that can help 
are things such as standardized guides and work instructions that the organization has 
to assist the project manager and the project team in doing the planned work. Other 

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
58
organizational process assets that can assist in the execution of the planned work include 
historical information from similar projects, and any standardized and established 
communication requirements.
Tools and Techniques
The three tools and techniques of this process are all used on the separate inputs to 
deliver the planned work or the approved changes.
Expert Judgment
Expert judgment as a tool for the Direct and Manage Project Work process is essential for 
taking the plans and other inputs and carrying out the implementation and execution of 
those plans. It is the job of the project manager and project team members to provide the 
expert judgment necessary to carry out the planning work and approved change requests 
to ensure that this process delivers its expected outputs.
In addition to the expertise of the project manager and project team members, you 
can also seek guidance from external experts and other stakeholders with skills and 
experience you require.
Project Management Information System
The project management information system is an automatic or manual system, such as 
common project management software or databases, used for storing and disseminating 
project information. Here it is used to track the work being done and communicate it 
effectively to the correct stakeholders.
■
■Exam Tip  Project management information systems can include software used 
for creating and monitoring schedule information such as Microsoft Project, Primavera, 
Trello, Atlassian, Wrike, Basecamp, ProjectLibre, or any one of the hundreds of other great 
examples. They can also include databases used for cost estimating and control, and range 
from standalone installations to larger enterprise resource planning systems.
Meetings
Meetings have many purposes throughout the PMBOK Guide, in this process and also in 
communications processes. In this instance, meetings are used as a tool by the project 
manager to discuss and make decisions on matters affecting the execution of the project. 

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
59
REAL WORLD
I have found that a properly organized meeting can be one of the most productive 
ways of sharing information, getting decisions made, and also building team spirit. 
To run one well, you need to spend time preplanning the meeting, set a clear 
agenda, have a real reason for the meeting, and set the expectation of the outcome 
from the meeting. You also need to invite only those people who need to be present 
and establish some ground rules. The absence of these basic points will result in a 
meeting that could potentially be a waste of time for all involved.
Outputs
The major output from the Direct and Manage Project Work process is the project 
deliverables.
Deliverables
The deliverables are often the major focus of any project. They are what the project was 
set up to do in the first place, and they are the primary output from this process. It can be 
a single deliverable or one of many deliverables. The product deliverable is the output 
from this executing process, whereas the other executing processes have outputs focused 
on project, not product, work.
The deliverables go on to become an input into the Control Quality process prior 
to becoming verified deliverables if they are approved. Once approved by the project 
team, verified deliverables then become an input into the Validate Scope process prior to 
becoming accepted deliverables if they are accepted by the customer.
Examples of deliverables include software modules for an IT project. If you 
are completing a construction project, the deliverable could be the entire building 
or significant parts of it. Clearly it is important that you are able to measure when a 
deliverable is complete, so you know when to complete this process.
Work Performance Data
Another output from this process is the work performance data, which is the documented 
record of observation and measurements of the deliverables taken during this executing 
process. The work performance data can include any data that records the percent 
complete, any technical measurements taken, the number of change requests made and 
approved, the number of defects found and corrected, and start and finish times, both 
expected and actual. You can probably tell that some of this data is generated by other 

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
60
executing processes. But due to the integrated nature of the Direct and Manage Project 
Work process, it gets included here as an output because it may affect and be used as an 
input by the following monitoring and controlling processes:
• 
Validate Scope
• 
Control Scope
• 
Control Schedule
• 
Control Costs
• 
Control Quality
• 
Control Communications
• 
Control Risks
• 
Control Procurements
• 
Control Stakeholder Engagement
Change Requests
As a result of doing the planned work, you may discover that there are some changes 
to part of the project management plan or product requirements. The change requests 
generated as a result of this process go on to become inputs into the Perform Integrated 
Change Control process.
■
■Exam Tip  All change requests must go through a documented and agreed-on change-
control process and be either approved or declined. Change requests fall into one of the 
following four categories: corrective action, preventive action, defect repair, and updates.
Project Management Plan Updates
As part of doing the planned work, you may choose to update some or all the component 
plans that make up the project management plan. Project management plan updates are 
different from change requests. Change requests signify that something new needs to 
be considered in an integrated manner. Project management plan updates are simply 
updates to documents and plans for clarification or revised approaches to executing the 
planned work and do not require a formal change request to be initiated.
Project Document Updates
In addition to updates to specific plans that form the project management plan, you 
can also carry out project document updates to provide clarification or to note any new 
information such as new issues, assumptions made, and decisions made.

Monitor and Control Project Work
■
■More Info  Monitor and Control Project Work
You can read more about the Monitor and Control Project Work process in the PMBOK Guide, 
5th edition, in Chapter 4, section 4.4. Table 2-4 identifies the process inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
62
The key area of focus in the Monitor and Control Project Work process is checking 
that what you are doing matches what you planned to do. Obviously, to do this you must 
have done some planning and use these plans and baselines to check that the work you 
are doing matches what you planned to do. Remember that the work you are doing is not 
just the product work but also all the project work defined in your project management 
plan.
The Monitor and Control Project Work process is one of two monitoring and 
controlling processes in the Project Integration knowledge area and one of a total of 11 
monitoring and controlling processes overall. Monitoring and controlling work is done 
throughout the life of the project, from initiation to closure.
The Monitor and Control Project Work process covers the following Monitoring and 
Controlling domain tasks:
• 
Task 1: Measure project performance using appropriate tools and 
techniques, in order to identify and quantify any variances and 
corrective actions.
• 
Task 5: Review the issue log, update if necessary, and determine 
corrective actions by using appropriate tools and techniques, in 
order to minimize the impact on the project.
• 
Task 6: Capture, analyze, and manage lessons learned using 
lessons-learned management techniques, in order to enable 
continuous improvement.
■
■Exam Tip  Hopefully by now you have started the process of immediately trying to 
determine what sort of inputs would be useful for completing a process and what sort of 
outputs that process will produce. Before reading any further, think about what sort of inputs 
would be useful for checking that what you are actually doing is what you planned to do.

Inputs
There are seven inputs into the Monitor and Control Project Work process, all specifically 
designed to assist you in producing the outputs of change requests, work performance 
reports, project management plan updates, and project document updates.
Project Management Plan
Once again, the project management plan forms a key input into a process, this time 
because if you are going to check that what you are doing is what you planned to do, 
you should have available to you as an input the project management plan and all 
its subsidiary plans—this is what you will be checking your work against. The project 
management plan is an output from the Develop Project Management Plan process.
Schedule Forecasts
Schedule forecasts are an output from the Control Schedule process in the Project Time 
Management knowledge area. They are obviously useful for determining if what you are 
actually achieving in terms of your project schedule is accurate and matches what you 
had planned or forecast.
Cost Forecasts
Cost forecasts are an output from the Control Costs process in the Project Cost 
Management knowledge area. As with the schedule forecasts, they are essential for 
monitoring and controlling progress on project costs.
Validated Changes
Validated changes are an output of the Control Quality process in the Project Quality 
Management knowledge area. They involve checking that any approved change requests 
and associated remedial actions have been undertaken as per the approval given. In this 
process, they are used as a part of the baseline of work being done, and you will now 
monitor and control these approved additional pieces of work.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
64
■
■Exam Tip  To fully understand what validated changes means, you must understand 
the difference between the words validate and verify. The PMBOK Guide has an extensive 
glossary at the back of the book that describes in detail the words used throughout. 
Validation means the product, service, or system meets the needs and requirements of 
the customer and other important stakeholders. Verification means the product, service, 
or system complies with documented regulations, specifications, or imposed technical 
conditions. Think of validation as an external process and verification as an internal process 
done before validation.
Work Performance Information
Work performance information is a very common output of a lot of the other monitoring 
and controlling processes. It is an output from the following processes:
• 
Validate Scope
• 
Control Scope
• 
Control Schedule
• 
Control Costs
• 
Control Quality
• 
Control Communications
• 
Control Risks
• 
Control Procurements
• 
Control Stakeholder Engagement
It includes all the data collected during these processes, and as an input into this 
process it is valuable for assessing what is actually happening against what you had 
planned to happen.
■
■Exam Tip  You may recognize that work performance data becomes work performance 
information, which in turn becomes work performance reports. Each step is a further 
refinement of the information.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
65
Enterprise Environmental Factors
The specific types of enterprise environmental factors that can be used in this process 
include any relevant government or industry standards, stakeholder risk tolerances, and 
your project management information system being used to provide information into this 
process and record and disseminate any results from the process.
Organizational Process Assets
The specific types of organizational process assets that can be used as inputs into this 
process include any existing processes and templates the organization has, lessons-
learned databases, risk-management procedures, documented change-control processes 
and procedures, and issue and defect management procedures.
Tools and Techniques
The following tools and techniques are available, if appropriate, to use on the selected 
inputs.
Expert Judgment
Once again, expert judgment appears as a key tool to assist in gathering, interpreting, and 
making sense of the inputs into the process to produce useful and meaningful outputs. In 
this process, the project manager and members of the project team are the most relevant 
and easily accessible experts to consult.
Analytical Techniques
Analytical techniques allow you to make sense of the inputs into the processes and the 
data they contain to forecast potential future scenarios. The PMBOK Guide specifically 
mentions the following analytical techniques:
• 
Regression analysis  The analysis of a dependent variable 
against one or more independent variables to determine the 
nature of the relationship, if any, between the variables and to 
extrapolate from this a likely future scenario. In this process, it is 
used to forecast a likely future state of perhaps time or costs based 
on past performance and the mathematical trend observed. It is 
often displayed in graph format, as shown in Figure 2-2.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
66
• 
Grouping methods  Techniques for taking what you have 
observed and classifying the data into relevant groups for further 
study and comparison. A specific type of grouping method uses 
exploratory study to compare sets of data and to look for patterns 
and correlations between the data for causal effects.
• 
Multiple-equation models  Tools that use simultaneous 
equations to describe a relationship between variables and 
forecast likely future outcomes.
• 
Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA)  A widely used 
technique to examine the consequence of failure in any part 
of the system and the use of those observations to ensure that 
failure does not actually occur or that, if it does, the impact is 
anticipated and mitigated. In this process, you could use this tool 
to determine the likely effect of failure in the product and prepare 
to ensure that it doesn’t happen.
• 
Reserve analysis  A tool for determining how much reserve you 
will need in any of the cost or time management processes or 
project management plan components.
• 
Trend analysis  A technique for observing data, trying to spot a 
trend in the data and use this observed trend to forecast a future 
state. You could use this in this process to spot a constant and 
regular trend in the product deliverable indicating that if the trend 
continues, you will end up with a product the client doesn’t want.
Figure 2-2.  A graph showing an example of linear regression

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
67
■
■Exam Tip  All of these analytical tools and techniques feature some form of 
mathematical modeling and use the results to forecast a future state. On the exam, if 
a mathematical tool or technique is referred to, and it is in a monitoring and controlling 
process, then it is probably one of these tools.
Project Management Information System
The project management information system is used here to record new data, retrieve 
existing data, and distribute any relevant data to stakeholders.
■
■Exam Tip  Remember that your project management information system is part of your 
enterprise environmental factors.
Meetings
Meetings are a useful tool for the project manager, project team members, and relevant 
stakeholders to exchange and discuss information. They are best held in a face-to-face 
environment where participants can see each other, but they can also be held in virtual 
formats. Meetings that would be useful during this process are kick-off meetings and 
review meetings.
The kick-off meeting is done on site with all relevant stakeholders as a means of 
communicating that the project has done enough planning work to begin executing. As 
such, this meeting is generally done immediately prior to beginning project execution.
Outputs
The following outputs are generated by the Monitor and Control Project Work process.
Change Requests
The key outputs from the Monitor and Control Project Work process are change requests 
generated as a result of observing and comparing what is actually occurring against what 
was planned and also generated by changing requirements. Several different categories 
of change requests can be made; these include corrective actions, preventive actions, and 
defect repair.
Change requests become an input into the Perform Integrated Change Control 
process, where they are assessed and decisions are made as to whether they are approved 
or declined. They are not acted on until they have been approved.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
68
Work Performance Reports
Work performance reports are generated by your project management information system 
in physical or electronic form and show how the project is progressing against what 
was planned, and any changes requested and subsequent actions taken. Typically work 
performance reports include any regular status updates, project memos, explanatory 
notes, and any other updates to project team members and stakeholders.
REAL WORLD
I find that not only are reports on work performance information a valuable means 
of communicating technical information, but they are also a valuable means 
of establishing and maintaining effective communications with team members 
and stakeholders. I have always been selective about what information goes to 
certain people and also what the best format is to ensure that the information I am 
distributing is understood by the recipients.
Project Management Plan Updates
As a result of monitoring and controlling the actual results against the planned results, 
you will detect variations, and as a result there will be some changes to your project, 
probably in several different areas. These need to be captured in updates to the relevant 
parts of your project management plan.
Project Document Updates
Just as there will be updates to parts of your project management plan, there will also 
need to be updates to project documents that deal with forecast, performance, or issues.

a total of 11 monitoring and control processes. The other 10 monitoring and controlling 
processes are focused on discovering any variations between what is planned and what 
is actually occurring, and generating change requests where appropriate. The Perform 
Integrated Change Control process deals with these change requests.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
70
The Perform Integrated Change Control process covers the following Monitoring and 
Controlling domain task:
• 
Task 2: Manage changes to the project by following the change 
management plan, in order to ensure that project goals remain 
aligned with business needs.
This is the process where all changes to any part of the project are considered and 
decisions are made about whether they are approved or rejected. As such, it receives 
inputs from all the other monitoring and control processes in the form of change requests 
that have been generated by these other processes. It is completed throughout the life of 
the project, as are all monitoring and control processes.
Change requests can come from many sources, including any stakeholder on the 
project. All changes, no matter how small, should be documented. Many change requests 
are initiated with a simple verbal request, but even these should be documented and 
recorded in some way. Documentation of change requests can range from simple email 
verification of verbal requests to completion of a formal change request document, right up 
to a complete business case for major changes to a project. Failure to document changes 
will result in scope creep. Scope creep occurs when undocumented change control is 
allowed to happen, involving small changes that are regarded as insignificant. Individually 
they may not pose a problem, but collectively they increase the chances of project failure.
Gold plating is the process of making small undocumented changes to a project that 
result in a better outcome for the client. Although it sounds good in theory, the key here 
is that it is still undocumented changes to a project. This is not to say that you should 
not pursue better outcomes for the project and the client, but that all changes should be 
documented and assessed according to an agreed-on change-control process.
■
■Exam Tip  At all times you should be delivering what is documented and only what 
is documented. This doesn’t mean you can’t change what is being delivered, but that all 
changes should be documented.
All changes should be recorded in a change log that assigns them a tracking number 
and records progress and outcomes on the decision-making process.
■
■Exam Tip  The identification and numbering of the changes in a change log is one 
example of a configuration management system at work. It is a system whereby you identify 
all the plans and the version of those plans to ensure that you are always working on the latest 
plans or parts of a project. Configuration verification and audit is the process of checking that 
the configuration management system is being used correctly and that all changes to it are 

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
71
recorded appropriately. You will find the configuration management system used in several 
areas throughout the PMBOK Guide, where it is broken down into the following three parts:
• 
Configuration identification: Deciding on the type and format of an 
appropriate configuration system to use.
• 
Configuration status accounting: Actually using each of the 
configuration management systems to track and surveil the project.
• 
Configuration verification and audit: Checking that people are using 
the configuration management system to ensure that documents 
are being tracked, the correct version of software is being used, 
processes are being used, and the right parts are being used.
Inputs
The following inputs can be used in this process.
Project Management Plan
The project management plan is a key input into this process, because it outlines what 
is planned to happen on the project. Many change requests are initiated as a result of 
observing a difference between what was planned and what is actually occurring. The 
project management plan is an output from the Develop Project Management Plan 
process.
Work Performance Reports
If you are going to assess the impact and nature of any changes, it is important that you 
have the work performance reports to assist you. They provide information about specific 
areas of the project and also allow the project manager and project team members to 
consider any impacts of a change in one area on other areas of the project.
The work performance reports are an output of the Monitor and Control Project 
Work process.
■
■Exam Tip  The difference between work performance reports, work performance 
information, and work performance data is that the work performance data is the raw 
information; work performance information is the raw information after it has been analyzed 
and contextualized, and after it incorporates the integrated nature of project management; 
and work performance reports are the information presented in a particular way to a 
particular group of stakeholders.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
72
Change Requests
The change requests are an essential input into this process, because it is focused on 
receiving a change request, considering it in light of the entire project, and making a 
decision about whether to approve or reject the change request.
As you have already learned, change requests are outputs of the other ten monitoring 
and controlling processes.
Enterprise Environmental Factors
The specific enterprise environmental factor that can affect the Perform Integrated 
Change Control process is primarily the project management information system, 
because it records all the changes, the work performance information and reports, and 
the decisions made about the change requests.
Organizational Process Assets
The organizational process assets that can be used to assist the Perform Integrated 
Change Control process are any change-control processes, templates, and procedures the 
organization has that guide assessment, delegated authority, and decision-making.
REAL WORLD
I am a strong advocate of documenting very clearly the levels of delegated authority 
that project managers have when it comes to making assessment and decisions 
about change requests. It is simply not practical for all changes to go to a change-
control board that perhaps meets monthly. It is far more sensible to allocate a 
certain amount of delegated authority to the project manager so the project can 
keep moving along. This view is reflected in the PMBOK Guide.
Tools and Techniques
The following tools and techniques can be used on the selected and available inputs to 
generate the outputs.
Expert Judgment
The specific type of expert judgment you will use as a tool in this process consists of those 
people with skills and experience to be able to assist in considering change requests and 
the information that will help decide whether to accept or reject the change requests. 
These experts can be individuals who are consulted about particular issues, or they can 
be groups of stakeholders who form the change-control board that meets to consider 
change requests.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
73
Meetings
Meetings, in this case change-control meetings, are attended by the change-control board 
that is responsible for assessing change requests and making the decisions to approve 
or reject change requests. Not all changes need to go to the change-control board via 
change-control meetings, though—only those specified in the documented change-
control process, which ideally should be part of your project management methodology, 
itself part of your organizational process assets.
Change-Control Tools
Change-control tools used in the Perform Integrated Change Control process can be any 
automated or manual system for organizing, recording, documenting, assessing, storing, 
and distributing decisions about change requests and the subsequent decisions made. 
You can tell that your project management information system is one example of the sort 
of change-control tool that can be used.
Outputs
The Perform Integrated Change Control process produces some or all the following 
outputs.
Approved Change Requests
Approved change requests are the primary output from the Perform Integrated Change 
Control process. They are the result of the selected inputs and the tools and techniques 
applied. All approved change requests are recorded in the change-request log.
The approved change requests go on to be incorporated into existing baselines and 
become an input in the following processes:
• 
Direct and Manage Project Work
• 
Control Quality
• 
Control Procurements
• 
Manage Stakeholder Engagement
Change Log
The change log is the document kept to record the change requests received and their 
status. It is used as an input in the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
74
Project Management Plan Updates
Approved change requests are added to existing baselines to become new baselines. 
Additionally, many approved change requests also affect other subsidiary project 
management plans. Project management plan updates are used as an input into the 
Develop Project Management Plan process.
■
■Exam Tip  According to the PMBOK Guide, a baseline is the original baseline plus any 
approved changes. This may differ from your current understanding of the baseline being 
only what you originally started with.
Project Document Updates
Just as approved change requests can change parts of the project management plan, they 
can also affect other project documents and require them to be updated, particularly 
those associated with the change-control process.

Close Project or Phase
■
■More Info  Close Project or Phase
You can read more about the Close Project or Phase process in the PMBOK Guide, 5th 
edition, in Chapter 4, section 4.6. Table 2-6 identifies the process inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs.
Table 2-6.  Close Project or Phase Process

Outputs
• Project management plan
• Accepted deliverables
• Organizational process assets
• Expert judgment
• Analytical techniques
• Meetings
• Final product, service, 
or result transition
• Organizational process 
asset updates
The Close Project or Phase process is one of two closing processes in the PMBOK 
Guide; the other is Close Procurements in the Project Procurement Management 
knowledge area.
The Close Project or Phase process covers the following seven closing domain tasks:
• 
Task 1: Obtain final acceptance of the project deliverables from 
relevant stakeholders, in order to confirm that project scope and 
deliverables were achieved.
• 
Task 2: Transfer the ownership of deliverables to the assigned 
stakeholders in accordance with the project plan, in order to 
facilitate project closure.
• 
Task 3: Obtain financial, legal, and administrative closure 
using generally accepted practices and policies, in order to 
communicate formal project closure and ensure transfer of 
liability.
• 
Task 4: Prepare and share the final project report according to the 
communications management plan, in order to document and 
convey project performance and assist in project evaluation.
• 
Task 5: Collate lessons learned that were documented throughout 
the project, and conduct a comprehensive project review, in order 
to update the organization’s knowledge base.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
76
• 
Task 6: Archive project documents and materials using 
generally accepted practices, in order to comply with statutory 
requirements and for potential use in future projects and audits.
• 
Task 7: Obtain feedback from relevant stakeholders, using 
appropriate tools and techniques and based on the stakeholder 
management plan, in order to evaluate their satisfaction.
This process is the only closing process in the Project Integration Management 
knowledge area and is focused on the activities involved in completing the work required 
in a project or a phase of a project. Because it is an integrated process, it involves closure 
over all the processes being used in the project and not just the deliverable. As the name 
of the process suggests, it is used when closing a project prior to deliverable handover, or 
when completing a phase of a project prior to awaiting approval to proceed to the next 
phase.
The role of the project manager during this process is important, because the project 
manager must take responsibility for closing the project and overseeing the required 
tasks. The project manager has responsibility for reviewing all the documents created and 
ensuring that what is being delivered matches what is documented. Having a closeout 
checklist as part of your organizational process assets is an effective way to document 
exactly what closure means, the tasks that must be done, the signatures that must be 
obtained, and the final steps to confirm the project is complete. The role of the project 
sponsor is also important, because that individual officially signs off on project or phase 
closure.
■
■Exam Tip  The PMBOK Guide places a high degree of importance on the value of 
creating lessons learned during the project and finalizing these during the closeout process 
through informal means, surveys, interviews, workshops, and post-implementation reviews. 
You should always assume that you will create lessons learned as part of your project, and 
always assume that lessons learned are available to you from previous projects when you 
begin a new one.
One of the key ways to distinguish this process from the Close Procurements process 
is that the Close Project or Phase process is focused not only on contractual closure 
but on all the aspects of administrative closure as well. Being an integrated process, it 
considers how contractual closure processes as part of the Close Procurements process 
may impact other areas of the project, and it also goes through the defined and approved 
closure process the organization has as part of its organizational process assets.
■
■Exam Tip  All projects must be closed, even if they end in less-than-perfect situations. If 
a project ends suddenly, then you must have a process in place to follow in this instance. If 
a question on the PMP exam poses this scenario, you should also assume that whatever the 
situation, you will enter some form of project-closure process.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
77
REAL WORLD
Project closure is one of those processes that we know we should do, but usually 
by the time we move into the part of the project where the bulk of our effort is on 
project closure, we are being called away to start a new project. I have learned that 
there are tangible benefits to staying focused on project closure in the face of these 
calls to join new projects. It is important to make sure you get formal signoff that 
the project is complete, collect and store lessons learned, and, if possible, hold a 
post-implementation review some time later to determine whether the deliverable is 
actually doing what it was supposed to do.
Inputs
The Close Project or Phase process uses the following inputs.
Project Management Plan
The project management plan defines the work to be done, and so, as part of seeking to 
close a project or phase of a project, you need the project management plan and must 
be able to prove that all the work planned has been completed. The PMBOK Guide 
describes the project management plan as the contract between the project manager 
and the project sponsor, because it is the document that defines what constitutes project 
completion. The project management plan is an output from the Develop Project 
Management Plan process.
Accepted Deliverables
Accepted deliverables are an output from the Validate Scope process in the Project Scope 
Management knowledge area. Because they are validated by your documented processes, 
they are now ready to be handed over as part of the project closure process.
Organizational Process Assets
The specific organizational process assets that can be used to assist the Close Project 
or Phase process are any documented closeout checklists, templates, processes, or 
requirements. Additionally, you can use any relevant historical information or lessons 
learned to assist you with this process.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
78
■
■Exam Tip  You should always do your closure planning during the Develop Project 
Management Plan process and the other planning processes. Along with all your other plans, 
you should also have a plan for how to close the project.
Tools and Techniques
The following tools and techniques can be used on the inputs into the Close Project or 
Phase process.
Expert Judgment
The type of expert judgment you use during this process includes the project manager, 
the project team members, the project sponsors, the client, your legal team, and any 
other stakeholders who can provide advice and opinion on project closure.
Analytical Techniques
Analytical techniques were used as a tool or technique in the Monitor and Control Project 
Work process to analyze data and forecast future trends. As a tool in this process, they 
are used to substantiate any information that can be used to confirm project or product 
deliverables. Of the possible analytical techniques that could be used, regression analysis 
and trend analysis are the most applicable and useful.
Meetings
Meetings between experts and other stakeholders involved in discussing and deciding 
on aspects of project or phase closure are an important tool in the process. Specific types 
of meetings that can be held include lessons-learned meetings, closeout meetings, and 
post-implementation review meetings.
Outputs
The Close Project or Phase process produces the following outputs.
Final Product, Service, or Result Transition
This is the whole point of the project—the reason it was initiated in the first place. This is 
the deliverable the entire project was planned to provide for the customer. In the case of 
phase closure, it is the milestone that is expected before approval is given to proceed to 
the next phase. The final product, service, or result is handed over to the customer as the 
final part of contractual closure.

Chapter 2 ■ Integration Management
79
Organizational Process Asset Updates
The end of a project and the time spent examining what was done well and what was 
not done so well is a great opportunity to look at updating any relevant organizational 
process assets as part of your commitment to continuous improvement. The project 
files, including all the documentation resulting from the completion of project activities, 
should be used to update any relevant organizational process assets. Gathering historical 
information and lessons learned, and using this information to update and improve 
organizational process assets, is also an important step. Organizational process asset 
updates are the final act of administrative closure.
■
■Exam Tip  Know the difference between contractual and administrative closure, and 
understand that contractual closure is always completed before administrative closure is 
completed.

The lessons-learned documents ensure that any part of the 
project that was done well and any part of the project that was 
not done well are documented for future project managers 
to use so they can take advantage of the strengths and avoid 
repeating the weaknesses in your project.
	
2.	
Closing a project means the completion of all work on a 
project. Closing a phase of a project is the end of one phase 
and not necessarily the end of the project. The successful end 
of a phase means waiting for approval to move to the next 
phase, usually with the output from the phase that is being 
closed.
	
3.	
The project sponsor’s role in the Close Project or Phase 
process is to accept the deliverable on behalf of the delivering 
organization and provide formal signoff for project closure.

Chapter Summary
• 
The Project Integration Management knowledge area recognizes 
and is focused on the way in which project work is not completed 
in separate discrete chunks. There is the need to take a high-level 
view across all project activities, and activities in one knowledge 
area may influence activities in another knowledge area.
• 
The project charter is the foundational document for the project, 
and all projects must have a project charter.
• 
The project management plan contains all the elements of 
integrated project planning and also all the other outputs from 
the other planning processes.
• 
The project management plan is an output from the Develop 
Project Management Plan process and an essential input into the 
Direct and Manage Project Work, Monitor and Control Project 
Work, Perform Integrated Change Control, and Close Project or 
Phase processes.
• 
The Direct and Manage Project Work process is focused on 
completing the work described in the project management plan. 
The project deliverables are the primary output from this process.
• 
The Monitor and Control Project Work process is focused on 
checking that what is being completed as part of the Direct and 
Mange Project Work process is what was planned. Any changes 
are issued as outputs from the process as change requests for the 
Perform Integrated Change Control process to deal with. Change 
requests can be outputs from any of the other monitoring and 
controlling processes in the PMBOK Guide, with the exception of 
the Perform Integrated Change Control process, for which they 
are an input.
• 
The Perform Integrated Change Control process is focused on 
receiving and considering all change requests and processing 
them as per the approved and documented change-control 
process. Change requests can be approved or rejected.
• 
The Close Project or Phase process is focused on completing 
all the activities associated with administrative and contractual 
closure. It provides the deliverable and closure for a project, or the 
milestone for a project being delivered in phases.

Calculate Net Present Value where the Present Value of 
Income is $250,000 and the Present Value of Costs is $180,000.
NPV is calculated by subtracting the Present Value of Costs 
from the Present Value of Income:
= $250,000 – $180,000 = $70,000
Calculate the Payback Period for a project with an initial cost 
of $450,000 and annual income of $110,000.
Payback Period is calculated by dividing the initial investment 
by the projected annual income:
= $450,000/ $110,000 = 4.09 years

 CHAPTER 3  
 Scope Management 
 This chapter looks at the processes focused on how to plan, define, manage, and control 
changes to the project requirements, scope, and work breakdown structure (WBS). 
 The Project Scope Management knowledge area includes six processes. Four of 
the six processes are planning processes; the other two are monitoring and controlling 
processes. Properly defining the project scope statement is critical in order to complete 
other planning activities such as planning the project cost, project time, quality, 
communications, human resources, and procurement.  Without   properly defined 
requirements, scope, and WBS, you simply cannot complete these other activities well. 
 The PMBOK® Guide Processes 
 Project Scope Management Knowledge Area 
 The six  processes in the Project Scope Management knowledge area are as follows:
• 
  Plan Scope Management (planning process) 
• 
  Collect Requirements (planning process)  
• 
 Define Scope (planning process) 
• 
  Create WBS (planning process) 
• 
  Validate Scope (monitoring and controlling process) 
• 
  Control Scope (monitoring and controlling process) 
  Defining and documenting the project scope is about documenting all the work to be 
completed and the work not to be completed, as part of the project and the product. It is 
important to note that the product scope is a subset of the project scope. Figure  3-1 shows 
the product scope as a subset of the project scope. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
92
 
■ Exam Tip   Many people are used to focusing on defining the product scope as part of 
their scope management work. It is important to realize that there is more to the scope of 
the project than just the scope of delivering the product and its technical requirements. The 
project scope includes all the planning work, executing work, monitoring and control work, 
and closing work that has to be done in addition to the delivery of the product. 
 What Is Project Scope Management? 
 Project scope management is focused on defining and managing the scope of work to 
be completed as part of the project. It is a highly iterative process that begins with the 
initiation of the project and the statement of work contained in the project charter. The 
project charter is then used as an input into gathering the requirements, which results in 
requirements documentation; it may also result in a preliminary scope statement. After 
you have performed these next iterations of defining the scope statement, you arrive at a 
project scope statement, which in itself may only define and detail the work to be done 
in the short term and may leave some of the work to be done in the longer term relatively 
undefined. 
 Figure 3-1.  Product scope as a subset of project scope 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
93
 
REAL WORLD
 Most people focus on the three pillars of project management: the scope, the time, 
and the cost of the project. This is for good reason, because these three foundational 
elements are most often used as the primary metrics of success in a project, 
and they also feed into the other areas of the profession of project management. 
Therefore, you should pay extra attention to the time and effort committed to 
defining the scope of a project: of the three pillars, it is the most crucial because it 
allows you to complete cost and time estimates. 
 Distinct terms are used to describe successive iterations of the work to be done on 
a project. Figure  3-2 shows a hierarchical view of the different terms used to describe 
successive and progressively more detailed iterations of the scope.  
 Figure 3-2.  Descriptions of project work reflecting the level of detail contained in  the 
 description 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
94
 
REAL WORLD
 When working on a project, I have found that most people want to spend a lot of 
time and energy defining the product without giving much thought to planning and 
defining all the other work that must be done on a project Not only does the lack of 
wider project work information create problems with your project as you proceed, 
but it also creates a false impression that all of your work as a project manager is 
focused on delivery of the product. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Make sure when reading a question on the exam that you are careful to 
look out for the words  project and  product  ” This is particularly important in questions 
relating to the project scope or the product scope. It is also important in the Project Quality 
Management knowledge area, where there are separate quality processes for the project 
and the product. 
 Plan Scope Management 
 
■ More Info   Plan Scope Management You can read more about the Plan Scope 
Management process in the PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, in Chapter   5  , section 5.1. Table  3-1 
identifies the  process inputs , tools and techniques, and outputs. 
 Table 3-1.  Plan Scope Management Process

management plan 
 The Plan Scope Management process is a planning process with two major outputs: 
the scope management plan and the requirements management plan. 
 The Plan Scope Management process addresses the following planning domain task:
• 
 Task 2: Develop a scope management plan, based on the approved 
project scope and using scope management techniques, in order 
to define, maintain, and manage the scope of the project.  

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
95
 The Plan Scope Management process, like most of the other planning processes, sets 
out and defines your particular approach for further definition of the project and product 
scope, and the way in which you are going to validate scope and control any changes to 
the scope. All of these elements are captured in the scope management plan. 
 
■ Exam Tip   You may begin to notice that the key output from the initial planning 
processes in any knowledge area is some form of plan. For example, a key output from the 
Plan Scope Management process is the scope management plan. 
 Inputs 
 The Plan Scope Management process uses some or all of the following inputs as part of 
the development of the scope management plan for the project. 
 Project Management Plan 
 The project management plan, at whatever stage of its development, is used as an input 
here into planning your approach to managing your scope. Keep in mind that early on 
in the project, the project management plan and its subsidiary plans will be relatively ill 
defined. As the project progresses and more details are known about the project and the 
subsidiary elements of the project, the project management plan itself will become more 
fleshed out. This clearly demonstrates the highly iterative nature of planning how you will 
manage your project and product scope. The project management plan is the key output 
from the Develop Project Management Plan process. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Keep in mind that the project management plan is the collection of all the 
other subsidiary plans and baselines. 
 Project Charter 
 The  project charter is used here as an input into the Plan Scope Management process 
because it contains the description of the project scope that is known at that point. If 
the project charter contains a statement of work, this will need to be further developed 
and defined into a full scope statement. If the project charter is built on the results of a 
negotiated contract, it may include a fully defined scope of work. The project charter is 
the sole output from the Develop Project Charter process. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
96
 Enterprise Environmental Factors 
 The types of enterprise  environmental factors that can play a role in how you manage 
scope can include things such as the culture of the organization and its attention to 
detail, risk, and quality; and any external marketplace conditions that the project is being 
initiated to take advantage of. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Enterprise environmental factors are one of the most widely used inputs 
throughout the PMBOK Guide. The term covers a lot of different factors that can influence 
a project. Take time to understand the variety of factors that are enterprise environmental 
factors and be able to differentiate them from organizational process assets. 
 Organizational Process Assets 
 Once again,  organizational process assets play an important role as an input into a 
planning process. The types of organizational process assets that are most useful in 
this section are any blank templates, defined policies and procedures, any historical 
information, lessons learned, and any project management methodology already in 
place. 
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following  tools and techniques are available to be used to develop the inputs into this 
process in order to produce the scope management plan. 
 Expert Judgment 
 Expert judgment  is one of the key tools used throughout the entire PMBOK guide. In 
relation to the Plan Scope Management process, the experts you will call on include your 
own expert judgment, the expert judgment of team members, and any other experts you 
want to consult to help you define your particular approach to scope management.  
 Meetings 
 Meetings in which you gather project team members and relevant stakeholders together 
are an important tool and technique in defining your approach to scope management. 
Attendees at such meetings should include anyone with responsibility for any part of the 
scope management process. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
97
 
■ Exam Tip   The way in which your run your meetings determines how effective they are. 
Meetings are both an important way to gather technical information and an important means 
of distributing information and building a high-performing team. These latter attributes of a 
meeting are more fully discussed in the Project Communications Management knowledge 
area and the Project Human Resource Management knowledge area. 
 Outputs 
 After applying the appropriate tools and techniques to the selected inputs, the Plan Scope 
Management process has the following outputs. 
 Scope Management Plan 
 The  scope management plan is one of the more important subsidiary plans contained in 
the project management plan. It outlines your particular process for iteratively defining 
the detail of the project and product scope, the process of decomposition for the creation 
of your work breakdown structure (a process that uses the scope statement that has been 
developed to execute project work), and the process by which any requested changes are 
considered and either approved or declined. In addition to these elements, it also sets out 
the process of validating the project scope and deliverables, and how signoff for closure 
will be obtained. Again, the detail in the scope management plan reflects the detail of the 
project scope. A highly defined scope results in a well-defined scope management plan, 
and a loosely defined scope results in a more flexible scope management plan, allowing 
for further iterations. 
 The scope management plan is used as an input into the following processes:
 5.2 Collect Requirements 
 5.3 Define Scope 
 5.4 Create WBS 
 5.5 Validate Scope 
 
REAL WORLD
 As a general rule of thumb, I like to make sure about one-third of the content of 
the scope statement refers to what is not included in both the project and product 
scope of work. If you don't specifically list the exclusions, stakeholders will make 
assumptions about what is, and what isn’t, included in the scope of work, and it is 
these assumptions that lead to disagreements. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
98
 Requirements Management Plan 
 The  requirements management plan is a specific plan that addresses how the product 
requirements are documented, defined, tracked, and reported against. It is also in the 
requirements management plan that detail of the configuration management activities 
are defined. The requirements management plan also contains methods for prioritizing 
the requirements, and any defined metrics to define the product. The requirements 
management plan is used as an input into the Collect Requirements process. 
 Quick Check

 What is the main focus of the Plan Scope Management 
process? 
 
 2. 
 What is the difference between the project scope and the 
product scope? 
 
 3. 
 What are the key differences between the scope management 
plan and the requirements management plan? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 The main focus of the Plan Scope Management process is 
to develop a scope management plan that will guide your 
activities in defining the project requirements, scope, and 
work breakdown structure. 
 
 2. 
 The project scope includes a definition of all the work 
required in the project, whereas the product scope focuses 
on defining the technical requirements of the expected 
deliverable. 
 
 3. 
 The scope management plan can be seen as the broader 
of the two management plans because it focuses on the 
entire project and product scope and how it will be defined, 
documented, and controlled. The requirements management 
plan focuses solely on further iterations and definition of the 
requirements of the project deliverable. 
 Collect Requirements 
 
■ More Info   Collect Requirements You can read more about the Collect Requirements 
process in the PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, in Chapter   5  , section 5.2. Table  3-2 identifies the 
process inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
99
 The  Collect Requirements process addresses the following planning domain task:
• 
 Task 1: Review and assess detailed project requirements, 
constraints, and assumptions with stakeholders based on the 
project charter and lessons learned, and by using requirements-
gathering techniques, in order to establish detailed project 
deliverables. 
 Requirements can best be defined as a definition of the stakeholders’ needs to 
meet the project’s objectives. They can include technical requirements or known 
constraints. Therefore, the process of collecting requirements involves stakeholders and 
documentation of what they believe the project objectives are. It is important to note that 
the project requirements can be much more than the product requirements. 
 
■ Exam Tip   On the exam, you should assume that unless otherwise explicitly stated, you 
must go through a requirements-gathering process prior to completing the scope statement. 
 
REAL WORLD
 I have often found that broader project requirements can be captured and 
documented as key performance indicators for determining the success or 
otherwise of the project, beyond the strict technical requirements of the product. 
For example, you could have customer satisfaction, health and safety compliance, 
environmental management requirements, or any other factors set as key 
performance indicators of project success, and these factors would be gathered in 
the requirements documentation.

 Inputs 
 The following inputs are used in the Collect Requirements process. 
 Scope Management Plan 
 Obviously, in order to collect and define the project requirements, it is important that you 
act according to your scope management plan, because the requirements are a subset 
of the project scope. The scope management plan is a key output from the Plan Scope 
Management process. 
 Requirements Management Plan 
 The requirements management plan is an important input into this process because it 
guides you as you seek to further define and document the requirements of the project 
and product. The requirements management plan is an output from the Plan Scope 
Management process. 
 Stakeholder Management Plan 
 The  stakeholder management plan is an important input into this process because you 
will be approaching stakeholders and asking what the requirements are for the project 
and the product. Thus, the stakeholder management plan and the information it contains 
about how you identify and manage stakeholder expectations is a critical part of and 
input into this process. The stakeholder management plan is a key output from the Plan 
Stakeholder Management process. 
 Project Charter 
 The  project charter authorizes the project and contains any high-level information about 
the product and project deliverable that can be used to assist the process of collecting 
more detailed requirements. The project charter is the sole output from the Develop 
Project Charter process. 
 Stakeholder Register 
 The  stakeholder register identifies the known stakeholders, their power and interest in 
the project, an assessment of their expectations, and an analysis of their communication 
needs. You can use this information to effectively interact with the stakeholders to ensure 
that you have gathered all the project and product requirements. The stakeholder register 
is an output from the Identify Stakeholders process. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
101
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques can be used to produce the outputs from the Collect 
Requirements process. 
 Interviews 
 When dealing with stakeholders, one of the most effective ways of soliciting information 
from them is by using  interviews . Interviews can be formal or informal, and they can be 
conducted in person or via email or surveys. 
 Focus Groups 
 Focus groups are a very effective means of bringing together relevant stakeholders and 
subject matter experts and gathering information from them in a structured way. 
 Facilitated Workshops 
 Facilitated workshops provide a forum to solicit information from various stakeholders 
in a controlled manner. They are focused and interactive by their nature and are often 
facilitated by an independent party. Examples of specific types of facilitated workshops 
include the joint application design/development sessions (JAD) and the quality function 
deployment (QFD) facilitated workshops used in new product development. 
 Group Creativity Techniques 
 Several types of  group creativity techniques can be used as tools in this process to further 
define and document project and product requirements. Brainstorming is a particularly 
popular one, in which you bring together relevant stakeholders with the experience and 
skills needed and run a free-flowing session where all ideas are considered good ideas 
and are further refined by the group. 
 The nominal group technique is a group creativity technique that uses a variety 
of voting methods by which group members rank the most useful ideas for further 
brainstorming. Examples include the fist-of-fives, where group members display their 
support for an idea by raising a number of fingers on their hands; weighted voting 
systems, where each member is given a certain number of votes to allocate between 
different ideas; and a simple, straightforward voting system to rank different ideas in 
terms of validity and prioritization. 
 Group Decision-Making Techniques 
 The goal of  group decision-making techniques is to generate either a consensus among 
group members or a decision to abide by majority opinion. Obviously, there will be 
dissenting and differing views on which ideas should have greatest priority. An important 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
102
part of running any group decision-making process is to establish early on how decisions 
will be made so that all participants are aware of the process for decision-making. You 
can agree on any one of the following group decision-making techniques to aid your 
decision-making process:
• 
 Unanimity or consensus is where everybody agrees on a single 
course of action. 
• 
 The Delphi technique, which gathers information anonymously 
from experts to avoid peer pressure, can be used if you want to 
allow experts to provide anonymous feedback.  
• 
 You can decide to use a simple majority for any decisions made. 
If a majority (more than 50% of the members of the group) cannot 
be obtained, you may decide to use plurality, in which the largest 
bloc in a group decides. 
• 
 A final method of obtaining a group decision in the face of 
dissenting opinions is to agree to allow one individual in the 
group to make the decision for the group. This is commonly 
referred to as a dictatorship group decision-making technique. 
 Questionnaires and Surveys 
 A key element of the Collect Requirements process is the gathering of information that 
can then be used to further define the requirements for the project and the product. 
 Questionnaires and surveys present a very effective means of gathering this information 
from identified stakeholders. Depending on the development of the questionnaires and 
surveys, the information gathered may be able to have some statistical analysis applied to 
it to aid in your requirements-gathering process. 
 Observations 
 Observations are a very accurate way of determining how a potential project or product 
scope will be implemented or used in real life. If the project scope includes certain 
processes, observing who will use these processes, how they will be used, and any other 
aspects in the real world will help define the process. If part of the project scope includes 
any product, observing the users of the product in the real world will also help define the 
product further. 
 Prototypes 
 Prototypes are a great way to get fast feedback on any element of the product by 
producing drafts and seeking feedback from stakeholders as to whether this is what they 
wanted. The practice of prototyping is quickly gaining support with the rise of technology 
that allows rapid prototyping. In addition to physical prototypes, storyboarding can be 
used to show the sequence of processes or product development to solicit feedback from 
stakeholders, particularly in the production of web pages or user interfaces. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
103
 Benchmarking 
 Benchmarking  is a tool used in several processes. It involves comparing what you planned 
to do against other projects or organizations to determining whether you are better or 
worse than them. You can gather this important information from competitors, trade and 
industry associations, and the Project Management Institute. 
 Context Diagrams 
 A  context diagram is a simple tool showing visually how a business system and users 
interact. Figure  3-3 shows an example of a context diagram. 
 Figure 3-3.  A context diagram showing the relationship between supplier, ordering 
software, accounts department, and warehouse 
 Document  Analysis 
 As part of refining the requirements, you may want to carry out a document analysis 
and examine any relevant documents such as business plans, data models, software 
documentation, and issues logs to help you summarize the requirements.   
 Outputs 
 The following outputs are generated from the Collect Requirements process. 
 Requirements Documentation 
 The  requirements documentation is highly iterative; you may be able to fully define 
certain requirements and not yet define other requirements. When requirements are 
fully defined and documented, they include a description of how the requirement 
meets the identified business need, objectives, or stakeholder requirements. They also 
include a traceability matrix identifying which stakeholders requested each requirement, 
defining acceptance criteria, and providing a link back to the business objective that the 
requirement is intended to meet. 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
104
 
■ Exam Tip   You can view the requirements documentation as a subsidiary of the scope 
statement. Rather than referring to the entire project and product scope, the requirements 
documentation focuses on individual requirements of parts of the project. 
 The  requirements documentation as an output goes on to be used as an input into 
the following processes:
 5.3 Define Scope 
 5.4 Create WBS 
 5.5 Validate Scope 
 5.6 Control Scope 
 8.1 Plan Quality Management 
 12.1 Plan Procurement Management 
 Requirements Traceability Matrix 
 The  requirements traceability matrix is a valuable tool for ensuring that the documented 
requirements are mapped directly back to business objectives. A requirements 
traceability matrix is a table that links the origins of individual product requirements 
to the expected deliverable that meets those requirements so that you can track 
requirements throughout the project life cycle. This is particularly important if you want 
to either change a requirement and assess the impact it will have on deliverables or check 
that a deliverable still meets the original requirement. 
 The  requirements traceability matrix is used as an input into the following two 
processes:
 5.5 Validate Scope 
 5.6 Control Scope

requirements, which are then used to define the scope of 
work. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT

 2. 
  The requirements documentation is a subset of the total 
project scope statement and relates specifically to how 
requirements of the project and product align with and deliver 
project objectives. The project scope statement describes and 
defines the total work to be done in delivering the project and 
product. 
 
 3. 
  Consultation with stakeholders is critical to successfully 
documenting and defining project requirements, because 
the wishes of stakeholders are driving the project, and 
by consulting them you can ensure that you meet their 
expectations by delivering the requirements. 
 Define Scope 
 
■ More Info   Define Scope You can read more about the Define Scope process in the 
PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, in Chapter   5  , section 5.3. Table  3-3 identifies the process inputs, 
tools and techniques, and outputs.

 • Facilitated workshops 
 • Project scope statement 
 • Project document updates 
 The  Define Scope process is one of four planning processes in the Project Scope 
Management knowledge area. The Define Scope process covers the following planning 
domain task:
• 
 Task 2: Develop a scope management plan, based on the 
approved project scope and using scope management 
techniques, in order to define, maintain, and manage the scope of 
the project. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
106
 
REAL WORLD
 It is very rare that you will ever begin a project with a complete and detailed 
description of the scope. Often this occurs only as a result of lengthy contractual 
negotiations. In almost every other situation, you will begin a project with enough 
of the scope defined to allow you to start, and then you will undertake successive 
iterations of definition and documentation as you go. You may also decide to commit 
time and energy to defining the scope for the immediate timeframe, and leave 
definition of the remainder of the scope until you get closer to the time of delivery. 
 Inputs 
 The following inputs can be used in the Define Scope process. 
 Scope Management Plan 
 Obviously, in order to define the scope, you are going to have to work according to 
your scope management plan, which sets out the process you will use to iteratively 
define and document the scope of both your project and the product. The project scope 
management plan is the key output from the Plan Scope Management process.  
 Project Charter 
 The  project charter can be used as a key input into the Define Scope process because it 
contains the project approvals and any known description of the project and product 
scope. The project charter is the sole output from the Develop Project Charter process. 
 Requirements Documentation 
 The requirements documentation is an output from the Collect Requirements process 
and contains the defined and documented project and product requirements. These 
requirements form an important part of both the project and product scope. 
 Organizational Process Assets 
 Organizational process assets that can be used to define the scope include any project 
management methodology, policies, and blank templates that the organization has. 
There is also a high probability that the organization has completed a project with a 
similar scope in the past, and thus any lessons learned or historical information from 
previous projects or phases are important organizational process assets that can be 
used when defining the scope. These resources can also include important internal 
stakeholders such as the project sponsor. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
107
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques can be used on the inputs to generate the process 
outputs. 
 Expert Judgment 
 Again we can see expert judgment as an effective tool; expert experience and skill can 
help you refine process inputs and develop them into the expected outputs. In this 
instance, you as project manager are one of the more important experts, as are your 
project team members, who are responsible for completing the project work, and any 
other stakeholders with relevant experience and skill in defining the scope. 
 Product Analysis 
 Product analysis is best used when a project is delivering a product, instead of a service or 
result, as its major deliverable. Breaking down the product into its component parts and 
ensuring that each part meets the requirements and technical specifications assists with 
documenting the product scope. Product analysis can also include value-engineering 
processes in which you try to use innovation to deliver the product as efficiently as possible. 
 Alternatives Generation 
 The process of   alternatives generation considers all the potential ways in which the 
project and product work can be performed in order to determine whether you are using 
the most efficient way of delivering the project and product scope.  
 Facilitated Workshops 
 Facilitated workshops involve bringing experts together in a workshop setting and having 
an independent facilitator guide the group to produce successive iterations of the project 
and product scope. The role of the independent facilitator is to stay neutral, set and 
enforce rules about how participants contribute, keep the workshop focused and on 
track, and make sure expectations are clearly understood.   
 Outputs 
 The following outputs are produced by the Define Scope process. 
 Project Scope Statement 
 The major output from the Define Scope process is the   project scope statement , which 
describes in increasing detail the deliverables, assumptions, and constraints of the 
project. The project scope statement defines all the work to be done on the project, 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
108
and  only the work to be done on the project. It includes a detailed description of the 
exclusions and the work that will not be done as part of the project. The project scope 
statement also includes a full description of the work to be done to deliver the scope of 
the product. 
 
■ Note   Scope creep and gold plating One of the primary reasons to conduct scope 
management planning exercises and produce a clear definition of the scope statement 
with a documented change-control process is to ensure that your project is not subject to 
scope creep.  Scope creep happens because of undocumented scope change. At all times, 
you must deliver only what is documented for your project and product scope. This does not 
mean that change will not occur on your project; in fact, quite the opposite—you can expect 
change at all points in your project. What it means is that you consider all changes, no 
matter how small or large, and if the change is accepted, you document this and incorporate 
it into your scope statement, thereby stopping scope creep. The other element to watch for 
with undocumented scope is gold plating.  Gold plating occurs when you see the opportunity 
to deliver greater quality for less cost and in less time to the client and decide to proceed 
with this without documenting it. There is nothing wrong with delivering greater quality and 
exceeding expectations, but once again, at all times you must only be producing what is 
documented. 
 The  project scope statement as an output goes on to be used as an input into the 
following processes:
 5.4 Create WBS 
 6.3 Sequence Activities 
 6.5 Estimate Activity Durations 
 6.6 Develop Schedule 
 Project Document Updates 
 The process of defining the scope will probably result in the requirement to update other 
project documents such as the stakeholder register, to identify any changes to stakeholder 
expectations; the requirements documentation, to account for any iterative development 
of the scope that affects requirements; and, dissociated from the requirements 
documentation, the requirements traceability matrix.

 Quick Check 
 
 1. 
  How do the Collect Requirements and Define Scope processes 
interact with each other? 
 
 2. 
 Why is it important to define exclusions in the project scope 
statement? 
 
 3. 
 How is the information about the project and product scope 
statement contained in the project charter different from the 
information contained in the project scope statement? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
  The Collect Requirements process takes the statement of work 
and project charter and seeks to gather requirements from 
stakeholders that are then used as an input into the Define 
Scope process to help define the scope statement. 
 
 2. 
 It is important to define the known project and product 
exclusions as part of the project scope statement in order to 
avoid ambiguity and assumptions about what is, and what is 
not, included in the work to be done. 
 
 3. 
 The project charter contains a description of the project and 
product work to be done that is known at the time of initiating 
the project. As such, it may be at a much higher level than 
the information contained in the project scope statement. 
Additionally, the project charter contains other information 
such as the project’s purpose, justification, and any required 
approvals. 
 Create WBS 
 
■ More Info   Create  WBS You can read more about the Create WBS process in the PMBOK 
Guide, 5th edition, in Chapter   5  , section 5.4. Table  3-4 identifies the process inputs, tools 
and techniques, and outputs. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
110
 The Create  WBS process is the last of the planning processes in the Project Scope 
Management knowledge area and relies on the Collect Requirements and Define Scope 
processes to be complete. The Create WBS process covers the following planning 
domain task:
• 
 Task 2: Develop a scope management plan, based on the 
approved project scope and using scope management 
techniques, in order to define, maintain, and manage the scope of 
the project. 
 
■ Exam Tip   On the exam, unless it is otherwise stated, you should assume that the 
processes of collecting requirements and defining the scope have occurred before beginning 
the process of creating the WBS. 
 Inputs 
 The following  inputs can be used to generate the outputs of the Create WBS process. 
 Scope Management Plan 
 The scope management plan is a key input because in this plan you have detailed how 
you will approach the process of decomposing the project scope statement and creating 
the work breakdown structure (WBS). The scope management plan is a key output from 
the Plan Scope Management process. 
 Project Scope Statement 
 The WBS is a breakdown of the entire  project scope statement   into its component parts; 
therefore, the project scope statement is a key input into the Create WBS process. The 
project scope statement is the key output from the Defined Scope process. 
 Table 3-4.  Create WBS Process 
 Inputs   ➪ 
 Tools and Techniques   ➪ 
 Outputs 
 • Scope management plan 
 • Project scope statement 
 • Requirements documentation 
 • Enterprise environmental factors 
 • Organizational process assets 
 • Decomposition 
 • Expert judgment 
 • Scope baseline 
 •  Project document 
updates 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
111
 Requirements Documentation 
 The requirements documentation is a key output from the Collect Requirements 
process. In addition to the project scope statement , having access to the requirements 
documentation and the requirements traceability matrix enables you to ensure that your 
process of decomposition to create the WBS captures all of the project and product scope 
and the associated requirements. 
 Enterprise Environmental Factors 
 There are some industry-wide  enterprise environmental factors that can be useful as an 
input into the Create WBS process. For example, the ISO/IEC 15288 standard on systems 
engineering-system life cycle processes could be used for engineering projects. 
 Organizational Process Assets 
 The most useful  organizational process assets to be used as an input into the Create WBS 
process include any project management methodology, policies, or blank templates for 
the creation of a WBS, and any historical information or lessons learned from previous 
projects. 
 Tools and Techniques 
 Two techniques are used in the Create WBS process. 
 Decomposition 
 The process of   decomposition involves taking a high-level description of the work to be 
done for the project and product, and successively breaking it down into deliverables, 
sub-deliverables, and finally  work packages . The work package is the lowest level to 
which you should break down the WBS. A work package is defined as a package of work 
that can reliably be estimated for time and cost. This means you can easily allocate the 
work to one person and that it doesn’t make sense to decompose it any further, because 
at that level you can develop an accurate estimate of the time it will take and the amount 
of money it will cost to complete the work package. Below the level of work packages are 
individual activities, which are used in the Project Time Management knowledge area to 
assist in building a project schedule. 
 The WBS is a  graphical representation of the total project scope; therefore, work 
that is not included in the WBS is not part of the project. If the project scope is being 
developed iteratively, this is represented in the development of the WBS, and it too 
develops iteratively. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
112
 
REAL WORLD
 I always use my project team members who are responsible for completing the work 
to help complete the WBS. Not only does this give me the right technical input from 
the people responsible for completing the work, but it also creates commitment 
to the process of completing the work, because people feel they have made a 
significant and personal contribution. 
 
■ Note   Decomposition is used in any of the breakdown structures used in project 
management. It simply describes a process of breaking down a larger concept into its 
component parts. It is used to create the WBS, the organizational breakdown structure 
(OBS), the risk breakdown structure (RBS), and another RBS, the resource breakdown 
structure (RBS). 
 Expert Judgment 
 Expert judgment  is a key tool in the Create WBS process because the creation of the WBS 
is best done by those experts with knowledge about the work to be done and how it can 
best be decomposed into its component parts. 
 Outputs 
 The following outputs are generated by the Create WBS process. 
 Scope Baseline 
 The  scope baseline  is used to measure what is actually being produced against what 
is expected to be produced in relation to the project and product scope. It is made up 
of three key, distinct elements: the project scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS 
dictionary. 
 
■ Exam Tip   The scope baseline is what you use to measure progress against in the 
project. Any baselines in project management can only be changed through the formal 
change-control process. After an approved change is integrated into a baseline, the baseline 
itself is changed; thus the easiest way to think of a baseline is that it is what you originally 
started with plus any approved changes. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
113
 The WBS is often called the  backbone of a project. This is because it acts as an 
input into many other planning processes. Without a complete and accurate WBS, your 
efforts in cost estimating, budget estimating, activity definition, risk identification, scope 
validation, and all the subsequent processes they provide inputs into would be extremely 
difficult. Creation of the WBS is done by decomposing the top-level descriptions 
of project work into their component parts. The highest level is broken down into 
deliverables, then into sub-deliverables, and then into individual work packages. A work 
package is an amount of work that can reliably be estimated for time and cost and can 
generally be performed by one person. Below work packages are activities, which are 
used in developing a project schedule, as described in the next chapter. 
 Figure  3-4 shows a WBS for a new house project, with the breakdown of different 
work streams to work package level. Note that all nodes in the WBS have a unique 
identifying number that allows you to track work being done and also to allocate costs to 
specific work packages for better cost reporting. The  numbering system   should clearly 
identify each node and relate to the node above so you can easily see related nodes and 
the way they are decomposed. This numbering system is an example of a configuration 
management system. 
 Figure 3-4.  A  work breakdown structure (WBS)  showing the total project, deliverables, 
sub-deliverables, and work packages 
 
■ Note   WBS  dictionary When you are representing a WBS graphically, each node in the 
WBS can contain only summary information, such as the configuration management details; 
the name of the deliverable, sub-deliverable, or work package; and summary information 
about the time, cost, and resources allocated to each node. The WBS dictionary is a text-
based document that provides additional information about the summary information 
contained in each WBS node. 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
114
 The WBS becomes an input into the following processes:
 5.5 Validate Scope 
 6.2 Define Activities 
 7.2 Estimate Costs 
 7.3 Determine Budget 
 11.2 Identify Risks 
 11.3 Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis 
 
■ Exam Tip   Many exam questions pose a scenario where something is missing and ask 
what you should do. In most instances, it is acceptable to continue with the project and 
develop something in the interim to help tide you over. The only exception to this is if it is the 
WBS that is missing. If is you are working on a project and do not have the WBS, you must 
stop and create the WBS, because without it you cannot complete the planning processes of 
your project. 
 Project Document  updates 
 As a result of creating the WBS, information may be gathered that requires other project 
documents to be updated, such as the project scope statement and the requirements 
documentation. 
 Quick Check 
 
 1. 
 To what level of detail do you decompose the project scope 
when creating the WBS? 
 
 2. 
 How would you define the key elements of a work package?  
 
 3. 
 What elements make up the scope baseline? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 The project scope statement is decomposed to major 
deliverables, to sub-deliverables, down to the work package 
level. 
 
 2. 
 A work package can best be defined as an amount of work that 
can reliably be estimated for time and cost. Going any further 
in the decomposition process delivers little benefit for the 
time taken to do the work. 
 
 3. 
 The three key elements of the scope baseline are the project 
scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary.

 Validate Scope 
 
■ More Info   Validate Scope You can read more about the Validate Scope process in the 
PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, in Chapter   5  , section 5.5. Table  3-5 identifies the process inputs, 
tools and techniques, and outputs.

 The Validate Scope process is a monitoring and control process, one of two 
monitoring and control processes in the Project Scope Management knowledge area. 
 The Validate Scope process covers the following domain monitoring and controlling 
task:
• 
 Task 1: Measure project performance using appropriate tools and 
techniques, in order to identify and quantify any variances and 
corrective actions. 
 
■ Note   Validation compared to verification The process of validation is important to 
understand, as is the difference between it and the process of verification. Verification 
is about confirmation that the product, service, or result produced complies with agreed 
specifications or requirements. It is primarily an internal process that the delivering 
organization performs prior to submitting the product, service, or result for validation, which 
involves the customer as well. Validation also involves a check that the product, service, or 
result meets stakeholder requirements. Verification occurs before validation. 
 Inputs 
 The Validate Scope process uses some or all of the following  inputs  . 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
116
 Project Management Plan 
 The  project management plan guides how you execute and monitor your project, and, 
as such, it contains plans and baselines useful for validating the project scope. The 
particular parts of the project management plan that are most useful as inputs into the 
Validate Scope process are the scope management plan and the scope baseline. The 
scope management plan is used as an input because it details how you plan to manage 
your scope in its entirety, including validation. The scope baseline, which includes the 
scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary, is absolutely necessary in validating 
the scope because it represents the baseline against which you are comparing the actual 
work performed. The  project management plan is an output from the Develop Project 
Management Plan process; the scope management plan is a key output from the Plan 
Scope Management process; and the scope baseline is the key output from the Create 
WBS process. 
 Requirements Documentation 
 The  requirements documentation lists the project objectives and the requirements that 
will deliver those objectives, and as such it is an essential input into validating the scope. 
Requirements documentation is the key output from the Collect Requirements process.  
 Requirements Traceability Matrix 
 The requirements traceability matrix provides an additional measure of rigor when 
validating the scope, because you are able to link specific requirements back to identified 
business objectives. The requirements traceability matrix is an output from the Collect 
Requirements process. 
 Verified Deliverables 
 The  verified deliverables are deliverables that have already been completed and checked 
for correctness against the required specifications through the control quality process 
and, as such, now need to be validated in order to become accepted deliverables and 
used in the Close Project or Phase process. Verified deliverables are a key output from the 
Control Quality process. 
 
■ Note   Deliverables Project deliverables must go through the process of first being 
verified and then being accepted. Verification is an internal process that ensures correctness 
against predetermined quality standards, whereas validation is an external acceptance 
process completed by the project sponsor or customer. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
117
 Work Performance Data 
 The  work performance data indicates whether there is compliance with the documented 
requirements. Work performance data is an output from the Direct and Manage Project 
Work process. 
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following two tools and techniques can be used to deliver the process outputs. 
 Inspection 
 Inspection  as a technique literally means inspecting the deliverables to ascertain whether 
they meet the documented requirements and acceptance criteria. 
 Group Decision-Making Techniques 
 Group decision-making techniques are any techniques used to allow a group of people to 
reach a decision. It is best if the decision-making technique is outlined to the group prior 
to the decision-making process being undertaken, to be sure that all group members 
understand how the decision will be made. 
 Outputs 
 The Validate Scope process has the following outputs. 
 Accepted Deliverables 
 Accepted deliverables meet the acceptance criteria and are signed off and accepted by 
either the customer or the project sponsor. Accepted deliverables are used as the key 
input into the Close Project or Phase process. 
 
■ Exam Tip   A key role of the project sponsor is to act as the person internal to the 
performing organization who formally accepts the product. The customer is usually a person 
external to the organization who accepts the product. 
 Change Requests 
 If a deliverable is not accepted due to some areas of noncompliance or noncorrectness, a 
 change request  for defect repair may be generated. Change requests are a key input into 
the Perform Integrated Change Control process. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
118
 Work Performance Information 
 Work performance information takes the work performance data and presents it in such 
a way that project progress can easily be determined and identified. This information is 
communicated to stakeholders as appropriate. Work performance information is used as 
an input into the Monitor and Control Project Work process. 
 
■ Note   Work performance Work performance data is the raw data gathered in any 
process. Work performance information is the data after it has been interpreted into 
something meaningful. Work performance data becomes work performance information, 
which in turn is used in work performance reports. 
 Project Document Updates 
 The types of  project documents that may be updated include requirements 
documentation, the scope statement, and quality control documents. 
 Quick Check 
 
 1. 
 What is the main focus of the Validate Scope process? 
 
 2. 
 What is the difference between validation and verification?  
 
 3. 
 Who formally accepts the project deliverables? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 The main focus of the Validate Scope process is to formally 
accept the completed project deliverables. 
 
 2. 
 Verification is an internal process completed by the 
performing organization measuring the product, service, 
or result against defined requirements and specifications. It 
is completed prior to validation. Validation involves taking 
the verified product, service, or result and, in conjunction 
with key stakeholders, confirming that it meets stakeholder 
requirements. 
 
 3. 
 The project sponsor formally accepts the project deliverables 
on behalf of the performing organization. The customer 
formally accepts the project deliverables on behalf of the 
external organization requesting the work to be done.

 Control Scope 
 
■ More Info   Control Scope You can read more about the Control Scope process in the 
PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, in Chapter   5  , section 5.6. Table  3-6 identifies the process inputs, 
tools and techniques, and outputs.

 The Control Scope process is a monitoring and control process, one of two 
monitoring and control processes in the Project Scope Management knowledge area. 
 The Control Scope process covers the following monitoring and controlling  domain   
task:
• 
 Task 1: Measure project performance using appropriate tools and 
techniques, in order to identify and quantify any variances and 
corrective actions. 
 Inputs 
 The following inputs can be used in the Control Scope process. 
 Project Management Plan 
 The  project management plan , or, more correctly, some of the subsidiary plans of the 
project management plan, are used as inputs to enable you to control the scope. By using 
a description of what you planned to do and comparing that to what you are actually 
doing, you can spot any variances. The project management plan is a key output from the 
Develop Project Management Plan process. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
120
 
■ Exam Tip   Whenever you see the project management plan listed as an input into 
a process, it indicates that more than one subsidiary plan is used in this process. In this 
instance, elements of the scope management plan, change management plan, configuration 
management plan, and requirements management plan are used as inputs to control the 
scope. 
 Requirements Documentation 
 The clearly defined  requirements documentation for the project and product can be used 
to detect any deviation in the scope during the Control Scope process. The requirements 
documentation is a key output from the Collect Requirements process.  
 Requirements Traceability Matrix 
 Using the  requirements traceability matrix as an input helps bring an additional level 
of rigor into the Control Scope process by enabling you to map requirements back to 
project objectives. The requirements traceability matrix is a key output from the Collect 
Requirements process. 
 Work Performance Data 
 Work performance data in this instance refers to information about change requests 
received or the number and type of deliverables completed. Work performance data is 
the key output from the Direct and Manage Project Work process. 
 Organizational Process Assets 
 Key  organizational process assets that can be useful as inputs into the Control Scope 
process include any change control–related or scope control–related guidelines, policies, 
or templates, and any documented monitoring and reporting methods. 
 Tools and Techniques 
 There is a single technique used in the Control Scope process. 
 Variance Analysis 
 Any  variance analysis  is simply an examination of what is actually occurring against 
what was planned to occur, looking for any variances, positive or negative, and acting on 
them accordingly. If you discover any variance, you can decide to undertake corrective or 
preventive actions or initiate changes. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ SCOPE MANAGEMENT
121
 
■ Exam Tip   Variance analysis is a key tool in all the monitoring and controlling processes. 
Wherever you see variance analysis as a tool in a process, you should also look for some 
sort of baseline that is being checked for variance. 
 Outputs 
 The following outputs are produced by the Control Scope process. 
 Work Performance Information 
 Work performance information as an output from this process includes information 
relating to the type and category of change requests received and how they may 
potentially affect other areas of the project. Work performance information goes on to be 
used as an input in the Monitor and Control Project Work process. 
 Change Requests 
 Change requests are a result of variances detected. All change requests must be processed 
according to the predefined change management process. Change requests go on to be 
used in the Perform Integrated Change Control process. 
 Project Management Plan Updates 
 Elements of the project management plan that may be updated as a result of the work 
done during the Control Scope process include the project scope statement, WBS, and 
WBS dictionary. 
 Project Document Updates 
 As a result of performing the Control Scope process, you may choose to update the 
requirements documentation to reflect new or changed information. 
 Organizational Process Assets Updates 
 Organizational process assets that may be updated as a result of the Control Scope 
process include any elements of the project scope management plan, change 
management plan, or lessons learned that have been gathered.

 Quick Check 
 
 1. 
 What is the main focus of the Control Scope process? 
 
 2. 
 Why is variance analysis important to the Control Scope 
process? 
 
 3. 
 What is the relationship between work performance data and 
work performance information? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 The main focus of the Control Scope process is to check the 
progress of the project against planned baselines, looking for 
variances and acting on any that are discovered.  
 
 2. 
 Variance analysis is the process of checking what you planned 
to do against what you are actually doing. If you discover a 
variance between the two, then you must act. 
 
 3. 
 Work performance data is the raw data collected while 
observing work being performed; it is turned into work 
performance information by applying metrics, formulas, and 
other ways of interpreting the data in order for it to make 
sense and be usable for measuring project progress.       
 Chapter Summary 
• 
 The Project Scope Management knowledge area is focused on 
the processes of planning, defining, documenting, and managing 
change to the project requirements, scope, and work breakdown 
structure (WBS). 
• 
 Like other knowledge areas, the Project Scope Management 
knowledge area begins with a process of planning how you will 
manage the project scope. The key output from this is the scope 
management plan, which becomes a subsidiary plan of the 
project management plan. 
• 
 The first step in a linear process of defining the full project 
scope is to collect project requirements from stakeholders and 
develop both the requirements documentation and requirements 
traceability matrix. 
• 
 The process of defining the project scope is highly iterative and 
may be subject to rolling-wave planning throughout the life of 
the project. After it is defined, the project scope is captured in the 
project scope statement. The scope of the product is a subset of 
the total project scope.

 The WBS is a graphical representation of the project scope 
statement; thus any work not included in the WBS is not included 
as part of the project. The WBS forms one of three key elements of 
the scope baseline. The scope baseline is made up of the project 
scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary. 
• 
  The WBS, after it is completed, serves as a valuable input into 
several other processes, including Project Cost Management, 
Project Time Management, and Project Risk Management. 
• 
  The process of validating the project scope involves internal and 
external stakeholders checking that the deliverables conform to 
stakeholder requirements and expectations. It is performed after 
scope verification. 
• 
 All changes to the project scope or requirements must go through 
the documented change control process. Any approved changes 
are incorporated into the scope baseline. 
 Exercises 
 The answers for these exercises are located in the “Answers” section at the end of this 
chapter.
 
 1. 
 Create a WBS. 
 You are working on a project, Project BlueTalk, to develop 
a new piece of software. As part of the development of the 
scope, you have identified that the four major deliverables 
are the software design, the testing of the software, the user 
training of the software, and the implementation of the 
software. At this early stage in the project, you are only able to 
further define the software design process and have broken 
that down into the sub-deliverables for module 1 and module 
2. Using your project team members responsible for the 
software design, you have broken module 1 down into three 
work packages: database, user interface, and backup. 
 Use this information to complete a WBS for the project.

Chapter 4
Time Management
This chapter focuses on the topic of project time management. Project Time 
Management, like the other knowledge areas, begins with a process of planning that 
produces a schedule management plan. Then there is an iterative, or repeating, process 
that produces and updates the project schedule. Then, as with all other knowledge areas 
with the exception of the Human Resource Management knowledge area, there is a 
controlling process that seeks to measure planned versus actual progress in relation to 
time and deal with any changes or corrective or preventive actions.
You may need to pay particular attention in this chapter to those activities that lead 
up to the construction of the network diagram, because there is quite a bit of technical 
information you need to learn.
The PMBOK® Guide Processes
Project Time Management Knowledge Area
The seven processes in the Project Time Management knowledge area are as follows:
• 
Plan Schedule Management (planning process)
• 
Define Activities (planning process)
• 
Sequence Activities (planning process)
• 
Estimate Activity Resources (planning process)
• 
Estimate Activity Durations (planning process)
• 
Develop Schedule (planning process)
• 
Control Schedule (monitoring and controlling process)
What Is Project Time Management?
Project time management is focused on the processes of developing a schedule 
management plan, estimating durations for activities and the overall project, preparing 
your project schedule, ensuring that the project progresses as planned and that 
milestones are reached on the communicated schedule, and influencing and assessing 
any changes to the project schedule.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
134
■
■Exam Tip  Some industries use the term schedule in reference to a schedule of 
materials to be used in the execution of the project. For the exam, you should note that the 
word schedule is used exclusively to mean project time estimates.
Apart from the Control Schedule process, the processes contained in this knowledge 
area present what appears to be a wonderfully logical and sequential flow of information, 
from defining activities through to development of the project schedule. Figure 4-1 shows 
the general flow through this linear process.
Figure 4-1.  The sequential flow of the Project Schedule Development Process
REAL WORLD
Even though the project time management processes are often presented as 
separate, discrete processes, I have always found that the process of developing a 
project schedule is in fact done as one process, usually all at the same time.
■
■Exam Tip  Remember that the output of the time management processes is the project 
schedule, which refers to all elements of time management on a project and not just the 
ubiquitous Gantt chart. Also remember that a project management plan is more than just a 
Gantt chart.
Plan Schedule Management
■
■More Info  Plan Schedule Management You can read more about the Plan Schedule 
Management process in the PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, in Chapter 6, section 6.1. Table 4-1 
identifies the process inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
135
The Plan Schedule Management process is a planning process with a single output—
not surprisingly, given the name of the process, it is the schedule management plan. Like 
all other planning documents, the schedule management plan will guide your efforts in 
defining and controlling the project schedule. It will form a subsidiary plan to the overall 
project management plan.
The Plan Schedule Management process covers the following planning domain task:
• 
Task 4: Develop the project schedule based on the approved 
project deliverables and milestones, scope, and resource 
management plans, in order to manage timely completion of the 
project.
Inputs
The Plan Schedule Management process uses some or all of the following inputs as part 
of the development of the schedule management plan for the project.
Project Management Plan
Any reference to the project management plan includes a reference to all subsidiary 
management plans that it contains. Obviously, any aspect of work on the project will 
incur some time; therefore, the project management plan, with its information about 
other areas, provides a useful input into planning your particular approach to schedule 
management. Any and all information relating to the project scope, project cost, project 
risk, project communications, project procurement, and stakeholder expectation 
management will be useful in assisting you develop your schedule management plan.
Project Charter
The project charter, which is the foundational document of the project, providing and 
confirming financial and political support for the project, contains useful information 
about the known statement of work, any initial known constraints and assumptions, and 
an assessment of the known risks. This preliminary information contained in the project 
charter is particularly useful when you first begin defining your project schedule.
Table 4-1.  Plan Schedule Management Process
Inputs   ➪
Tools and Techniques   ➪
Outputs
• Project management plan
• Project charter
• Enterprise environmental factors
• Organizational process assets
• Expert judgment
• Analytical techniques
• Meetings
• Schedule 
management plan

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
136
Enterprise Environmental Factors
Enterprise environmental factors are any factors external to the project that can influence 
the outcome; they can usually be viewed as some sort of constraint on the project. 
Particular enterprise environmental factors that may assist with development of your 
schedule management plan include the wider organizational culture and structure 
and the inherent skills available throughout the organization. Additional enterprise 
environmental factors that are useful in developing a project schedule include any 
external published commercial information that can be used to estimate time on a 
project, and any company work-authorization systems.
Organizational Process Assets
Organizational process assets that may play an important part as inputs into the 
development of your schedule management plan include historical information, blank 
templates, and project management methodology guidelines.
■
■Exam Tip  Historical information and lessons learned are considered to be two of the 
most important organizational process assets that any project manager can rely on in the 
development of any part of the project management plan. On the exam, you will find an 
emphasis on historical information and lessons learned as important inputs into many 
processes.
Tools and Techniques
The following tools and techniques are available to be used to develop the inputs into this 
process in order to produce the schedule management plan.
Expert Judgment
Again, expert judgment is used as a tool. Expert judgment is the advice and opinion of 
any person or group who holds specific knowledge about a particular area. You as project 
manager are considered to be an expert, your project team members are experts, and any 
other person with specialist knowledge you choose to consult is also an expert.
■
■Exam Tip  Deciding to use expert judgment is one thing; how you get the information 
from selected experts is another matter and is the subject of other information-gathering 
tools and techniques, such as meetings, the Delphi technique, interviews, questionnaires, 
and surveys.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
137
Analytical Techniques
As part of the development of the schedule management plan, you have to make 
decisions about which processes, tools, and techniques are best used in your particular 
project. This process of analyzing the potential options available to you is referred to as 
using analytical techniques.
Meetings
Meetings are a useful tool to bring together everyone with experience in developing the 
schedule management plan. When run properly, they are an effective and efficient means 
of getting work done. The most useful people to invite to these particular meetings are 
members of the project team and people with experience in developing schedules.
Outputs
After applying the appropriate tools and techniques to the selected inputs, the Plan 
Schedule Management process has the following output.
Schedule Management Plan
The Plan Schedule Management process has only a single output: the schedule 
management plan. The schedule management plan is a subsidiary plan of the project 
management plan. The purpose of the schedule management plan is to guide the 
project manager and the project team; the plan also guides further activities, such as 
defining and developing the project schedule, checking for variance between what has 
been planned and what is actually happening, and managing any changes to the project 
schedule. As such, it is an important plan to have in place in order to provide oversight, 
standardization, and best practices to ensure that the project schedule, itself an essential 
part of any successful project, is well developed, monitored, and controlled.
■
■Exam Tip  Always assume that any aspect of your project management activities has 
some form of plan guiding it. The absence of a plan will result in inefficient and ineffective 
efforts that can increase the chances of project failure.
The schedule management plan is then a key input into the following processes, all 
of which are planning processes:
6.2 Define Activities
6.3 Sequence Activities
6.4 Estimate Activity Resources
6.5 Estimate Activity Durations
6.6 Develop Schedule

The Define Activities process is a planning process that takes the already-defined 
work packages from the Create WBS process and breaks them down further into 
individual activities.
The Define Activities process covers the following planning domain task:
• 
Task 4: Develop the project schedule based on the approved 
project deliverables and milestones, scope, and resource 
management plans, in order to manage timely completion of the 
project.
The difference between an activity and a work package is that an activity is the 
smallest component of work to be performed during the course of a project. A work 
package is a convenient level of work to stop at when completing the work breakdown 
structure (WBS), because at that point the work can reliably be estimated for time and 
cost. Breaking work packages down into activities for the purposes of the WBS has a 
decreasing benefit given the time and effort taken to do this. However, for the purpose of 
putting together an accurate project schedule, you must break work packages down even 
further to the level of activities.
REAL WORLD
When completing any decomposition of the project scope statement, it sometimes 
seems arbitrary to stop the decomposition process at the level of work packages 
and then come back later to break them down further into activities. Therefore, 
during the process of decomposition of the scope, whether to show it graphically 
in a WBS or to obtain a list of work packages and activities to put into the project 
schedule, I generally do both processes at the same time.
Inputs
The Define Activities process uses some or all of the following four inputs.
Schedule Management Plan
The schedule management plan is obviously a key input into the Define Activities process 
because the schedule management plan contains information about how you will break 
down activities and the level of detail expected from the activities listed. The schedule 
management plan is an output from the Plan Schedule Management process.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
140
Scope Baseline
The scope baseline is used to ensure that the project manager captures all the activities 
contained in the project scope. When breaking down the project scope into its 
component parts, you can use the scope baseline and all the information it contains to 
ensure that you have captured all the activities required to complete the project. The 
scope baseline is an output of the Create WBS process.
■
■Exam Tip  Remember that the scope baseline includes the following three elements: the 
project scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary.
Enterprise Environmental Factors
The specific types of enterprise environmental factors that are useful as inputs into 
the Define Activities process are any aspects of the project management information 
system, any relevant parts of the organizational culture and structure, and any published 
information from commercial databases.
Organizational Process Assets
The specific types of organizational process assets that are useful as inputs into the Define 
Activities process are any existing project management methodologies, processes, and 
templates that can assist with the development of the project schedule. Additionally, 
any configuration management system that defines how different versions of the 
project schedule are recorded, controlled, and updated can be used as an input. This is 
particularly important to ensure that you are always working on the correct version of any 
document in what can be a highly iterative process. Of course, any historical information 
from past projects that can be used to assist in the compilation of the current project 
management plan is also useful.
Tools and Techniques
The following three tools and techniques are used on the inputs to deliver the process 
outputs.
Decomposition
You have read about the process of decomposition used in the Create WBS process to take 
the scope of the project and decompose it down to the work package level. As a tool and 
technique in the Define Activities process, it is used to further decompose the already-
defined work packages to activity level.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
141
Rolling-Wave Planning
Rolling-wave planning is a key iterative element of the project manager’s planning 
process. It is a form of progressive elaboration in which you can plan in detail work that is 
in the immediate future, and plan in less detail work that is further off.
A good example of rolling-wave planning is when you have a project that is to go on 
for two and a half years. You will spend most of your planning activity on the work coming 
up in the next three months. Work to be done from three months to nine months out will 
have a lesser level of detail attached to it during planning, but still enough to give you 
confidence about project time and cost. Work that is to be done beyond the nine-month 
period may have a very low level of detail attached to its time and cost elements.
Expert Judgment
You may decide to call on the expert judgment of people with skills and experience in this 
type of project and in the preparation of project schedules, in order to more accurately 
define your project activities.
Outputs
The Define Activities process produces some or all of the following outputs.
Activity List
The activity list is a comprehensive list that includes all currently known activities. In 
addition to listing the title and brief description of the activity, the activity list can provide 
additional information such as a unique identification number, which is an example 
of the configuration management system at work, and any other relevant ancillary 
information.
It is important to note that if you are undertaking any form of progressive elaboration 
or rolling-wave planning, you may only have identified and defined the activities for the 
next immediate time period; definition and documentation of activities beyond this may 
yet need to be done.
The activity list is used as an input into the following processes:
6.3 Sequence Activities
6.4 Estimate Activity Resources
6.5 Estimate Activity Durations
6.6 Develop Schedule

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
142
Activity Attributes
The activity attributes are to the activity list what the WBS dictionary is to the WBS. The 
activity list contains summary information about each activity, whereas the activity 
attributes document provides more detailed information about each of the activities. This 
detailed information can include any requirements, known constraints and assumptions, 
required milestones, and any other information that helps any person wanting to know 
more about the activity to understand it fully.
The activity attributes document is used as an input into the following processes:
6.3 Sequence Activities
6.4 Estimate Activity Resources
6.5 Estimate Activity Durations
6.6 Develop Schedule
Milestone List
As part of the development of the project schedule, and after the project activities have 
been defined, the project manager, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, may be 
able to produce a list of known milestones that should be achieved on the project. The 
milestone list contains these documented milestones.
■
■Exam Tip  Remember that a milestone has no duration and indicates a particular 
moment in time, usually when some specific work package or phase of a project has been 
completed. A milestone is often used as a point in the project where an assessment of work 
to date is done and decisions made about whether the project will continue.
REAL WORLD
I often use the milestone list and a description of which milestones have been 
achieved and which ones have not yet been achieved as a high-level way of 
communicating project progress quickly to senior stakeholders on the project.

A work package is the lowest level of decomposition in the 
work breakdown structure (WBS). It represents a parcel of 
work that can reliably be estimated for time and cost. On the 
other hand, an activity is a decomposed work package, broken 
down into the actual tasks that need to be done on a project.

Rolling-wave planning is an important tool to use on long-
term projects. With rolling-wave planning, planning and 
detail is done for the immediate time period, and time periods 
that are further out are planned in less detail.

The primary purpose of the activity attributes document is to 
provide further and more detailed information about each of 
the activities in the activity list.
Sequence Activities
■
■More Info  Sequence Activities You can read more about the Sequence Activities 
process in the PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, in Chapter 6, section 6.3. Table 4-3 identifies the 
process inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs.

The Sequence Activities process is a planning process that takes the list of activities 
that have already been defined and starts to put them in the order in which they will be 
completed.
The Sequence Activities process covers the following planning domain task:
• 
Task 4: Develop the project schedule based on the approved 
project deliverables and milestones, scope, and resource 
management plans, in order to manage timely completion of the 
project.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
144
Inputs
The inputs used in this process allow for sequencing of the already-defined project 
activities.
Schedule Management Plan
The schedule management plan is used as a key input into the Sequence Activities 
process because it outlines and defines how and when you will sequence the activities. 
The schedule management plan is an output from the Plan Schedule Management 
process.
Activity List
The activity list is a very important input into the Sequence Activities process, because 
you need the list of activities to put them in order. The activity list is an output from the 
Define Activities process.
Activity Attributes
The activity attributes document provides additional information about each of the 
activities that may be useful when it comes to deciding whether they are predecessors or 
successors for any other activity. The activity attributes document is an output from the 
Define Activities process.
Milestone List
The milestone list is an important input because it has a description of the known project 
milestones, and with this you can determine which activities must be completed before 
the milestone and which must be completed after the milestone. The milestone list is an 
output from the Define Activities process.
Project Scope Statement
The project scope statement is used as an input into the Sequence Activities process 
because it allows you to understand the complete scope of work to be delivered in the 
project. Thus you can get a clear idea of which activities must be performed before other 
activities.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
145
Enterprise Environmental Factors
The specific types of enterprise environmental factors that are of use during the Sequence 
Activities process are scheduling tools, government or industry standards, and any other 
external factors affecting the order in which work is to be completed on your project.
Organizational Process Assets
The specific organizational process assets that can assist you in sequencing the activities 
include any existing processes, templates, historical information, or lessons learned 
documentation that the organization owns.
Tools and Techniques
The three tools and techniques of this process are all used on the separate inputs to 
deliver the process outputs.
Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)
The precedence diagramming method (PDM) is a graphical representation of activities 
in a project, represented on nodes, with the relationships between them indicated 
by arrows. This is more commonly called the activity-on-node (AON) diagram. It 
establishes a predecessor and successor relationship between activities. An activity can be 
a predecessor of other activities, meaning it must be done before them. The same activity 
can also be a successor activity to one or more activities, meaning it must be done after 
them.
As mentioned already, a predecessor activity is one that comes before another 
activity, and a successor activity is one that comes after another activity. A predecessor 
activity may have many successor activities, in which case it is known as a burst activity. 
A successor activity may have one or more predecessor activities. If the successor activity 
has more than one predecessor activity, it is known as a merge activity. Figure 4-2 shows 
an example of Activity A as the predecessor activity, with Activities B and C as the 
successor activities. Activity A is also a burst activity.
Figure 4-2.  Predecessor and successors

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
146
Four types of relationships exist between predecessor and successor activities:
• 
Finish-to-start (FS): The successor activity cannot start until 
the predecessor activity has finished. For example, you cannot 
erect the walls of a house until the foundation has been 
completed. Figure 4-3 depicts how this would be represented 
diagrammatically.
Figure 4-3.  Finish-to-start relationship
• 
Finish-to-finish (FF): The successor activity cannot finish until the 
predecessor activity has finished. For example, you cannot finish 
writing the user manual for a piece of software until the testing 
is finished. Figure 4-4 depicts how this would be represented 
diagrammatically.
Figure 4-4.  Finish-to-finish relationship
• 
Start-to-start (SS): The successor activity cannot start until the 
predecessor activity starts. For example, you cannot begin testing 
a new piece of software until you have started writing the code. 
Figure 4-5 depicts how this can be represented diagrammatically.
Figure 4-5.  Start-to-start relationship

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
147
• 
Start-to-finish (SF): The successor cannot finish until predecessor 
starts. For example, you may have an activity that is to send the 
invoice for a product, but the invoice cannot be sent (finished) 
until delivery of the product has started. This type of relationship 
is almost never used, because it seems to indicate that the 
successor should be the predecessor and vice versa. Figure 4-6 
depicts how this would be represented diagrammatically.
REAL WORLD
In most project management scheduling software, the default relationship for 
activities is finish-to-start. Check it out: if you enter FS after a predecessor, the FS 
disappears. However, if you enter FF, SS, or SF, it remains.
Dependency Determination
In addition to the types of relationships that exist between predecessor and successor 
activities, there are also four types of dependencies that determine the nature of the 
relationship between the two activities.
• 
Mandatory dependencies: The successor activity must always occur 
after the predecessor activity. For example, you must develop the 
code for a piece of software before you begin testing it.
• 
Discretionary dependencies: The successor activity should occur 
after the predecessor activity, although the two activities can be 
performed in another sequence if necessary.
Figure 4-6.  Start-to-finish relationship

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
148
■
■Exam Tip  Be aware that discretionary dependencies have some flexibility built into 
them in terms of how they are scheduled. Generally, they should be performed in sequence, 
with successor activities after their predecessor activities, but they can be performed 
in parallel if necessary. There can be an increased risk associated with performing 
discretionary dependencies in parallel rather than in sequence, and this additional risk 
would need to be considered when putting together the project schedule.
• 
External dependencies: The activity is dependent on an activity 
being completed outside of the project. For example, you cannot 
start construction on the house until you have received building 
consent.
• 
Internal dependencies: The activity relies on another activity that 
is external to the project but internal to the broader organization. 
For example, the recruitment of people on your project may be 
done by the human resources department, and you have to wait 
until they complete the work.
Applying Leads and Lags
As you start to put together your project network diagram by beginning with the 
sequencing of the activities, you can also choose to apply leads and lags. A lead is the 
amount of time a successor activity can start before its predecessor activity finishes. 
For example, generally speaking, you do not start building the walls of a house until 
construction of the foundation has been completed. However, you can get a lead on the 
construction of the walls by having them built off site.
The opposite of a lead is a lag. A lag is the amount of time a successor activity must 
wait after its predecessor activity has finished before it can start. For example, in the case 
of pouring concrete for a house foundation, you must wait several days while the concrete 
cures before you can start building on it. Because the concrete curing period has neither 
resources nor costs assigned to it, it cannot be included as an activity in your network 
diagram. Instead, you indicate that the successor activities must wait via a lag before they 
can begin.
REAL WORLD
If you want to indicate a lead between a successor and its predecessor by using 
Microsoft Project, Primavera, or ProjectLibre, this can be done by using the 
relationship acronym, such as finish-to-start (FS), and a minus sign followed 
by the number of time periods the activity can start before the completion of its 
predecessor. For example, FS – 4 means the successor activity has a finish-to-
start relationship with its predecessor activity and can start four days before the 

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
149
predecessor activity ends. If you want to indicate a lag, you can do this by using a 
plus sign after the relationship acronym. For example, if you want to indicate a lag of 
three days, you simply write the task ID number of the predecessor and then, for a 
finish-to-start relationship, FS + 3.
Outputs
The major outputs from the Sequence Activities process are the following.
Project Schedule Network Diagrams
The project schedule network diagram represents all the activities in the project and the 
relationships between them all. The process of completing the sequencing of activities is 
the first step in the completion of the project schedule network diagram. This first pass, 
which indicates the relationships between the activities, will be further fleshed out with 
more information in the coming processes as you use the resource estimates to define 
the durations of each of the activities. Then you will be able to calculate the total project 
duration, the amount of slack or float in the project, and the critical path or paths.
Figure 4-7 shows what an activity-on-node (AON) network diagram might look like 
at the end of the sequencing process. Information about each activity is represented 
in the nodes on the diagram, and the arrows indicate the relationships between the 
activities. In this case, they are all finish-to-start (FS) relationships. The AON diagram 
is the most popular graphical way of representing a network, but there is another less 
intuitive way called the activity-on-arrow (AOA) diagram.
Figure 4-7.  Activity-on-node network diagram

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
150
REAL WORLD
It is highly unlikely that you will need to know how to construct a network diagram 
manually in the real world. I have found that the main benefit of knowing how 
to put together a network diagram, calculate the project duration, calculate any 
slack in the network diagram, and determine a critical path is for understanding 
and appreciating how project management software works. Perhaps the only time 
you will need to know how to do this manually is for a small part of your project 
schedule at short notice when software isn’t available.
■
■Exam Tip  The other way to graphically represent a network diagram is called the arrow 
diagramming method or the activity-on-arrow (AOA) diagram. The AOA diagram is not used 
very much in the project management world, because it seems to run counter to the logical 
representations of activities and the relationships between them. Because the activities 
themselves are represented by arrows, it becomes a problem to also use arrows to show 
relationships between activities; so where there are multiple predecessors to an activity, a 
dummy activity is used, represented by a dotted line. Figure 4-8 shows an example of an AOA 
diagram with a dummy activity showing a relationship between Activities B and G. On the 
exam, if you find a reference to a dummy activity, you know it is referring to AOA diagrams.

The key area of focus in the Estimate Activity Resources process is to consider the 
defined activities and carry out the process of estimating what resources will be required 
to complete the work.
The Estimate Activity Resources process covers the following planning domain task:
• 
Task 4: Develop the project schedule based on the approved project 
deliverables and milestones, scope, and resource management 
plans, in order to manage timely completion of the project.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
152
■
■Note   Defining resources A resource can be defined as any person, team, machinery, 
equipment, material, or funds used to do work on the project.
Inputs
There are eight inputs into the Estimate Activity Resources process, all specifically 
designed to assist you in producing the outputs.
Schedule Management Plan
Again, the schedule management plan appears as a primary input into a process devoted 
to producing the project network diagram. This is because the schedule management 
plan is the document that describes and defines your approach to producing a project 
schedule. The schedule management plan is an output from the Plan Schedule 
Management process.
Activity List
The activity list provides information about all the activities you have defined. You use 
this information to estimate individual resources assigned to each activity. The activity 
list is an output from the Define Activities process.
Activity Attributes
The activity attributes document provides additional information about each activity on 
your activity list. This information can refer to which resources are available. The activity 
attributes document is an output from the Define Activities process.
Resource Calendars
Resource calendars are a key input into this process because they define constraints on 
when resources are available to work. They define such things as normal working times, 
holidays, and any other constraints on when resources may be available. Resource 
calendars are an output from the Acquire Project Team process in the Human Resource 
Management knowledge area.
Risk Register
The risk register is used to assist with estimating activity resources because it documents 
any known risks that might affect resources you plan to use on the project. The risk register 
is an output from the Identify Risks process in the Risk Management knowledge area.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
153
Activity Cost Estimates
You can use activity cost estimates to determine the cost of the resources you may be 
considering for each activity. Activity cost estimates are an output from the Estimate 
Costs process in the Cost Management knowledge area.
Enterprise Environmental Factors
The specific types of enterprise environmental factors that can be used in this process 
include any constraints imposed on resource availability for the project, such as 
government regulations on mandatory types of resources that must be used, or perhaps 
regulations of health and safety that affect the number of people who must be present in 
a workplace.
Organizational Process Assets
The specific types of organizational process assets that can be used as inputs into this 
process include any existing processes and templates, any relevant human resource 
policies, and any relevant policies in relation to procurement of supplies and equipment 
that the organization has. Additionally, a key organizational process asset is always 
historical information from previous projects.
Tools and Techniques
The following tools and techniques are available, if appropriate, to use on the selected 
inputs.
Expert Judgment
Expert judgment is a key tool, because you will use the judgment of experts to help 
produce the activity resource estimates. The types of experts you should consult are those 
people with prior and specialized knowledge in resource planning on a project similar to 
your own.
Alternative Analysis
The process of alternative analysis considers all the permutations of delivering an 
activity by using different combinations of resources, quantities of resources, and types of 
resources, and whether you will rent or buy the resources you require.
Published Estimating Data
Published estimating data is a convenient means of getting reliable data from commercial 
sources. This published estimating data can give you information about what resources 
are available, the cost of these resources, and the work rate of the resources.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
154
■
■Exam Tip  You will use published estimating data as a tool for cost-estimating 
processes as well.
Bottom-Up Estimating
Bottom-up estimating is an estimating process that begins at a low level of the WBS, 
such as at individual work packages or even at the activity level, and works upward by 
aggregating, or adding up, resource estimates in each level of the WBS to arrive at a high-
level estimate. Bottom-up estimating is generally considered to be more accurate than 
top-down estimating, but it involves more time and effort to complete.
Project Management Software
Most projects plan to use many different types of resources, and it is neither effective nor 
efficient to do this process manually. This is where using project management software 
provides a definite advantage, because it can process information more quickly.
Outputs
The following outputs are generated by the Estimate Activity Resources process.
Activity Resource Requirements
The activity resource requirements list is the documented list of the resources you will 
require to complete every activity on your activity list. The activity resource requirements 
list goes on to be used as an input into the Plan Human Resource Management process 
and the Plan Procurement Management process.
Resource Breakdown Structure
The resource breakdown structure, like other breakdown structures, is used to decompose 
the categories of resources required and the specific resources required for the project. 
The resource breakdown structure then goes on to be used as an input into the Estimate 
Activity Durations process and the Develop Schedule process. Figure 4-9 shows an 
example of a resource breakdown structure.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
155
■
■Exam Tip  The resource breakdown structure is one of four breakdown structures you 
should know for the exam. The other three are the organizational breakdown structure, the 
risk breakdown structure, and of course, perhaps the most important, the work breakdown 
structure (WBS).
Project Document Updates
Types of project documents that may be updated as a result of the Estimate Activity 
Resources process are the activity list, activity attributes, resource calendars, and project 
schedule management plan.

Resource calendars provide information about resource 
availability; as such, they are an essential input into the 
Estimate Activity Resources process because they let you 
know when resources are available and when resources are 
not available to work on a project.
Estimate Activity Durations
■
■More Info  Estimate Activity Durations You can read more about the Estimate Activity 
Durations process in the PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, in Chapter 6, section 6.5. Table 4-5 
identifies the process inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs.
Table 4-5.  Estimate Activity Durations Process
Inputs   ➪

Outputs
• Schedule management plan
• Activity list
• Activity attributes
• Activity resource requirements
• Resource calendars
• Project scope statement
• Risk register

• Expert judgment
• Analogous estimating
• Parametric estimating
• Three-point estimating
• Group decision-making

The Estimate Activity Durations process is focused on taking the previous data you 
have produced in defining the activities, sequencing the activities, and estimating the 
resources required for each activity, and then estimating the duration of each activity 
so that you can roll up these individual estimates into a total estimate for the project 
duration.
The Estimate Activity Durations process covers the following planning domain task:
• 
Task 4: Develop the project schedule based on the approved 
project deliverables and milestones, scope, and resource 
management plans, in order to manage timely completion of the 
project.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
157
■
■Exam Tip  The Estimate Activity Resources process comes before the Estimate Activity 
Durations process because generally you need to know what resources are available in 
order to be able to estimate how long activity will take. The more resources you have, the 
faster an activity will be completed.
Inputs
The following inputs can be used in the Estimate Activity Durations process to generate 
the outputs.
Schedule Management Plan
The schedule management plan is again a key input into this process because it outlines 
the way in which you will complete your estimate of activity durations. The schedule 
management plan is an output from the Plan Schedule Management process.
Activity List
The activity list provides information about all the activities on a project and is an 
essential input, because you are now going to be estimating the duration of each of these 
activities. The activity list is an output from the Define Activities process.
Activity Attributes
Although the activity list provides you with a list of all the activities and some summary 
information about each of them, the activity attributes document provides more detailed 
information about each of the activities, including the resources allocated to them, any 
known constraints or assumptions, and any risks. Activity attributes are an output from 
the Define Activities process.
Activity Resource Requirements
The activity resource requirements match each activity in your activity list with allocated 
resources that have been estimated to complete the activity. The activity resource 
requirements are an output from the Estimate Activity Resources process.
Resource Calendars
Resource calendars provide you with information about constraints on resource 
availability. They specify when resources are available and when they are not available. If 
they are referring to people, they may outline holidays and known non-working times so 

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
158
that you can build these into your duration estimates. Resource calendars are also useful 
for indicating when resources are allocated to other projects and are thus not available to 
work on your project. Resource calendars are an output from the Acquire Project Team 
process.
Project Scope Statement
The use of the project scope statement as an input into the Estimate Activity Durations 
process provides a great level of oversight to ensure that you have captured the entire 
project scope. Furthermore, the project scope statement contains additional information 
that you may need to be aware of when estimating activity durations, such as any pre-
identified skilled resources and any known contract terms and requirements affecting 
duration estimates. The project scope statement is an output from the Define Scope 
process in the Scope Management knowledge area.
Risk Register
The project risk register includes an analysis of the risks associated with resource use 
on the project, and, as such, contains important information about uncertainty in your 
activity duration estimates. The risk register is an output from the Identify Risks process 
in the Risk Management knowledge area.
Resource Breakdown Structure
The resource breakdown structure provides you with a comprehensive decomposition 
of the types of resources you will require on the project, and with this information you 
can estimate durations better. The resource breakdown structure is an output from the 
Estimate Activity Resources process.
Enterprise Environmental Factors
The specific types of enterprise environmental factors that may be used as inputs into 
this process are any estimating databases the organization has accumulated or that 
are available from external sources, and any known productivity metrics useful in 
determining the durations of particular activities when completed by specific resources.
Organizational Process Assets
The organizational process assets that can be used to assist in the Estimate Activity 
Durations process are any historical information you have from previous projects, any 
lessons learned from previous projects specifically in relation to estimating, activity 
durations, and any organizational methodology and processes that can assist you in this 
process.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
159
Tools and Techniques
The following tools and techniques can be used on the selected inputs to generate the 
outputs.
Expert Judgment
The specific type of expert judgment you will use as a tool in this process will be from 
anyone with specific knowledge about how long activities should take. This expert 
judgment can come from team members, others in the organization, or external people 
with specific experience.
Analogous Estimating
Analogous estimating is an estimating technique in which you take a similar activity and 
extrapolate from that a current estimate based on the relationship between the other 
activity and this activity. For example, you may know that a similar activity took three 
days to complete, and the one you are currently estimating is twice as big; therefore, you 
would estimate a total duration of six days by using an analogous estimating technique.
■
■Note   Accuracy of estimates Any estimating technique is simply an attempt to forecast 
what the future may hold. The better the information that goes into the estimating process 
is, the better the estimate will be. For example, let's say that you are trying to forecast 
the weather for tomorrow, for one week from now, for one month from now, and for one 
year from now. In order to estimate the weather for tomorrow, you have available to you 
a lot of data, including quantitative data on what today's weather pattern is doing and 
what historical information and computer simulations tell you this weather pattern will do 
tomorrow. As a result of this detailed information going into the estimating process, you can 
be reasonably sure that your estimate about tomorrow's weather will be fairly accurate. 
As you move out in time with your weather forecasts, the data available to you and the 
computer simulations and historical information will provide less valuable input, and thus 
your weather forecast for a year away will basically just be a guess based on the seasonal 
expectations.
Parametric Estimating
Parametric estimating uses known quantities and known units of measurement and 
multiplies them together to arrive at an estimate. For example, you may know that each 
person can write 300 lines of code per day and that there are 3,000 lines of code to be 
written; therefore, your duration estimate using parametric estimating is 10 days.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
160
Three-Point Estimating
Three-point estimating is part of the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT), 
a technique that uses a weighted-average scenario to arrive at an estimate where there 
are most likely, optimistic, and pessimistic durations for an activity. If you were to take a 
simple average of three numbers, you would add the three numbers together and then 
divide by 3. The three-point estimating technique gives a higher weighting to the most 
likely estimate (tM) and assigns it a weight of 4, while assigning a weight of 1 to each 
of the optimistic (tO) and pessimistic (tP) duration estimates. With six numbers now 
instead of three, you divide by 6 to get the weighted average. Therefore, the formula for 
calculating a three-point estimate using this technique is
tO
tM
tP
+
×
(

■
■Exam Tip  The same formula is used to estimate project costs. In this section, the 
letter t is used to denote the variable being used to estimate time. When you are using 
this formula to estimate costs, the letter c is used instead. You may find it easier just to 
remember the formula without the t or c. Expert judgment, analogous estimating, parametric 
estimating, and three-point estimating are also used in the Estimate Costs process.
For example, if you have an optimistic estimate of 4 days, a most likely estimate of 7 
days, and a pessimistic estimate of 12 days and put these estimates into the three-point 
estimating formula, your three-point estimate for this activity is 7.33 days:

In addition to calculating the expected duration, you can also calculate the standard 
deviation and variance. The standard deviation is a calculation of how far away from the 
average duration, or the expected duration using the three-point estimating formula, your 
data is spread. A smaller standard deviation means the data is tightly grouped, whereas a 
larger standard deviation means the data is more widely spread.
The standard deviation calculation we use in the three-point estimating technique 
is essentially a heuristic, or rule-of-thumb, way of calculating standard deviation rather 
than the full formula used by statisticians. The formula subtracts the optimistic from the 
pessimistic and divides the result by 6:

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
161

So, using the previous example, the standard deviation is 8 divided by 6, which 
equals 1.33 days.
A benefit of calculating the standard deviation is that you can then estimate the 
confidence interval for a range of estimates. The confidence interval states the amount 
of the data that you expect to fall between the number of standard deviations above 
and below the mean. A standard deviation of one either side of the mean represents a 
confidence interval of 68%, a standard deviation of two either side of the mean gives a 
confidence interval of 95%, and a standard deviation of three either side of the mean gives 
a confidence interval of 99.7%.

■Exam Tip  Six standard deviation either side of the mean contains 99.999% of the 
population. More commonly known as Six Sigma, it is used as a quality management tool in 
the Project Quality Management knowledge area.
Figure 4-10 shows a normal distribution and the range of a population you would 
expect to find with either one, two, or three standard deviations (SD) either side of the mean.
Figure 4-10.  A curve showing standard deviations

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management

For example, in the previous scenario, you could say that you have a 95% degree 
of certainty that the estimate for the activity duration is between 7± 2.66 days. This is 
calculated by realizing that 95% certainty reflects two standard deviations either side of 
the mean. The standard deviation, as already calculated, equals 1.33 days; therefore, two 
standard deviations equals 2.66 days.
■
■Exam Tip  On the exam, you may be asked a question about a range of estimates of 
which you are either 68%, 95%, or 99.7% certain, which means the question is asking you 
to calculate one, two, or three standard deviations either side of the mean or average.
There is one more formula you need to be aware of: calculating the variance. The 
variance is calculated by multiplying the standard deviation by itself:
tP
tO




Using the previous example, the variance is the standard deviation squared, which 
equals 1.33 × 1.33, which equals 1.77.
■
■Note   Origins of three-point estimating The origins of the three-point estimating 
technique are reportedly from the U.S. Navy Polaris submarine program in the 1950s. The 
technique was developed to help improve the delivery of large, complex projects. It is a 
subset of the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT), which was one of the first 
analytical techniques to sequence activities and show the relationship between them.
■
■Exam Tip  On the exam, you will probably have to do some calculations using formulas. 
You should always round your answer to two decimal places. However, you may arrive at 
an answer that is a fractionally different from one of those presented. If this is the case, it is 
probably a safe bet, if you have used the right equation, that the answer closest to yours is 
correct.
Group Decision-Making Techniques
There are many ways to gather information from groups of people, each with its own 
benefits and drawbacks. The most common group decision-making techniques used are 
brainstorming, nominal group techniques, and the Delphi technique.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
163
Brainstorming is an excellent way of getting a group of people to think about many 
possible options. If you are facilitating a brainstorming session, you should encourage all 
ideas. The nominal group technique takes all the ideas and has the group vote on which 
ideas are worthy of further investigation.
The Delphi technique is a technique for soliciting information from experts on an 
anonymous basis. The reason is that often, bringing experts together into a room to 
provide expert opinion and advice results in the loudest being heard, or peer pressure 
influencing the opinions of those present. The Delphi technique aims to get around 
these potential problems and allow experts to contribute freely by asking each expert 
anonymously, via a structured questionnaire, for their opinion. After the first round of 
opinions has been gathered, the summarized results are often circulated again to all 
experts taking part in the process. They can then review the results and, if they want, 
change their original opinion.
REAL WORLD
The Delphi technique is a very effective way of getting accurate information from 
experts; however, it is also time consuming and can cost a significant amount of 
money to do successfully. I have been part of a Delphi technique that was used to 
determine the level of risk on IT projects; I never knew how many other experts were 
being consulted, but the entire process took about three weeks to complete.
■
■Note   Origins of the Delphi technique The Delphi technique is named after the oracle 
of Delphi, who was a priestess at the Temple of Apollo in ancient Greece. She went into a 
trance and provided advice about what the future might hold.
Reserve Analysis
A reserve analysis is the process of determining a justifiable reserve, or buffer, to be added 
to activities based on quantitative analysis carried out as part of developing the risk 
register. This process develops a contingency reserve, which is used for known unknowns, 
or identified uncertainty, in your project. It is a justifiable means of adding in extra time 
or cost. For example, if, during your quantitative risk assessment, you discovered that 
there was a 25% chance of a time delay of 10 days to a particular activity, you would add a 
contingency reserve of 2.5 days to your estimates. If the risk did not manifest, you would 
not need this contingency reserve.
The other sort of reserve that may be available to a project is a management reserve, 
which is a figure determined at the start of the project and that management and the project 
sponsor control for unknown unknowns, or unforeseen risks. A project can apply to use the 
management reserve. Use of the management reserve results in a change to the schedule 
baseline, because it is not factored into your duration estimates. Padding of estimates 
means making unjustifiable additions to cost or time estimates and is considered unethical.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
164
REAL WORLD
It can be extremely difficult to convince the project sponsor and members of the 
project steering group to approve a contingency reserve for either time or cost, 
because they need to be persuaded that your methodology for determining it is 
sound and based on quantitative data. I have always argued for the provision of 
a contingency reserve on the basis of “no surprises,” and this has generally been 
successful. When the identified activity has been completed, if there was no need to 
use the contingency reserve, this is reported, and the overall contingency reserve is 
decreased.
Outputs
The Estimate Activity Durations process produces some or all of the following outputs.
Activity Duration Estimates
The main output from the Estimate Activity Durations process is the activity duration 
estimates, which define and record the individual assessments for the time required 
to complete each activity on the activity list. The individual activity duration estimates 
include an expected duration for each activity and, if calculated, the range of uncertainty 
in each activity, which can be aggregated to provide an expected duration with the total 
range of uncertainty for the entire project. For example, you could report that the total 
project duration is expected to be 89 days with a 10% probability that it will take 95 days 
based on the reserve analysis. The activity duration estimates go on to be used as an input 
into the Develop Schedule process.
Project Document Updates
The specific types of project documents that may be updated as a result of completing 
the Estimate Activity Durations process are the activity list, the activity attributes, and any 
other documents relating to expected durations of activities that the organization has.
Quick Check
	
1.	
Using the three-point estimating technique, what is the 
expected duration of an activity with an optimistic duration 
of 8 days, a most likely estimate of 10 days, and a pessimistic 
estimate of 16 days?

What percentage of a data population would you expect to 
find within two standard deviations either side of a mean?
	
5.	
What are the two types of justifiable reserve that may be used 
on a project?
Quick Check Answers
	
1.	
If you apply the three-point estimating formula to this 
scenario, you will arrive at a three-point estimate of 10.66 
days.
	
2.	
The main benefit of using the Delphi technique is to allow 
experts to contribute their opinions anonymously and 
without peer pressure.
	
3.	
Analogous estimating uses similar scenarios to extrapolate 
a current estimate, whereas parametric estimating uses a 
known quantity and multiplies it by a known metric.
	
4.	
You would expect to find approximately 95% of a population 
within two standard deviations either side of a mean.
	
5.	
Both the contingency reserve, for “known unknowns,” 
and the management reserve, for “unknown unknowns,” 
are developed by using quantitative data and historical 
information and, therefore, provide justifiable reserves.
Develop Schedule

166
The Develop Schedule process takes all the information you have gathered in the 
previous processes—Define Activities, Sequence Activities, Estimate Activity Resources, 
and Estimate Activity Durations—and combines them into the project network diagram, 
which graphically represents the project schedule.
The Develop Schedule process covers the following planning domain task:
• 
Task 4: Develop the project schedule based on the approved 
project deliverables and milestones, scope, and resource 
management plans, in order to manage timely completion of the 
project.

Inputs
The Develop Schedule process uses the following inputs.
Schedule Management Plan
The schedule management plan is an essential input into the Develop Schedule process 
because it outlines the way in which you will develop the project schedule. The schedule 
management plan is an output from the Plan Schedule Management process.
Activity List
The activity list provides you with a list of all the activities you have defined for the project 
that need to be completed. Each activity needs to be represented on the completed 
project schedule, and thus the activity list is a key input into this process. The activity list 
is an output from the Define Activities process.
Activity Attributes
The activity attributes give you more detailed information about the activities on the 
activity list, which only provides summary information about each activity. The activity 
attributes are an output from the Define Activities process.
Project Schedule Network Diagrams
The project schedule network diagrams present each of the activities and the relationship 
each has with predecessors and successors. The full development of the project schedule 
takes this preliminary information and adds additional detail to it, such as the estimate 
of activity resources and the individual estimate of activity durations, to produce the 
final project schedule. The project schedule network diagrams are an output from the 
Sequence Activities process.
Activity Resource Requirements
The activity resource requirements are used to allocate resources to each of the activities 
identified in the project. Activity resource requirements are an output from the Estimate 
Activity Resources process.
Resource Calendars
The resource calendars provide information about any known constraints on the use of 
resources on your project that may affect your scheduling. The resource calendars are 
an output from the Acquire Project Team process in the Human Resource Management 
knowledge area.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
168
Activity Duration Estimates
The activity duration estimates are absolutely essential if you want to complete a project 
schedule. You use these individual estimates and aggregate them to determine your total 
project duration. Activity duration estimates are an output from the Estimate Activity 
Durations process.
Project Scope Statement
The project scope statement gives you information about the project and product scope 
of work to be completed, and it also provides information about known constraints and 
assumptions and any known contractual obligations that will affect your project schedule. 
The project scope statement is an output from the Develop Project Scope process in the 
Scope Management knowledge area.
Risk Register
The risk register contains information about known schedule risks and known resource 
risks of the project. As part of the analysis of these risks, there may be the development 
of contingencies relating to time that must be taken into account in developing a project 
schedule. The risk register is an output from the Identify Risks process in the Risk 
Management knowledge area.
Project Staff Assignments
The project staff assignments specify which organizational employees are to be allocated 
to each activity and provide an analysis of experience and skills that each particular 
person brings. The project staff assignments are an output from the Acquire Project Team 
process in the Human Resource Management knowledge area.
Resource Breakdown Structure
The resource breakdown structure is used as an input because it provides the details of 
the categories of individual skills that resources must be able to bring to the project to 
complete the assigned activities. The resource breakdown structure is an output from the 
Estimate Activity Resources process.
Enterprise Environmental Factors
The specific enterprise environmental factors that may be used as inputs, if appropriate, 
are any external standards, regulations, contractual obligations, or licensed scheduling 
tools that you will use to develop the project schedule.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
169
Organizational Process Assets
The specific organizational process assets that may be useful in developing your project 
schedule include any existing project management methodology, blank templates, 
tools, and other techniques owned by the organization for the preparation of a project 
schedule.
Tools and Techniques
The following tools and techniques can be used on the inputs into the Develop Schedule 
process.
Schedule Network Analysis
Schedule network analysis is a primary tool used to bring together all the previous 
information you have gathered when you defined the activities, sequenced the activities, 
estimated the activity resources, and estimated the activity durations. You use all of this 
information to put together your full schedule network diagram; when it is completed, 
you can use the critical path method, critical chain method, what-if analysis, or resource 
leveling to determine the total project duration and the amount of total float or slack 
between specific activities and in the overall project.
REAL WORLD
There are many ways of drawing the information contained in each node of an 
activity-on-node (AON) network diagram, and there are at least two ways of 
representing the numbering systems used to calculate durations between activities.
Critical Path Method
The critical path method focuses on identifying all the paths through a project and, with 
the aid of a network diagram, determining which of these paths presents the shortest 
duration and also the least amount of scheduling flexibility as indicated by the length 
of slack or float. The path with the shortest duration and the least slack or float through 
the project represents the path of most risk to the project—hence the name critical path. 
There can be many paths through a project, as Figure 4-11 shows.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
170
This network diagram contains the following paths:
• 
A-B-E-H-J
• 
A-C-F-H-J
• 
A-C-F-I-J
• 
A-D-F-H-J
• 
A-D-F-I-J
• 
A-D-G-I-J
However, you cannot determine which path or paths are the critical paths until you 
complete a full schedule network analysis.
■
■Note   Slack and float There are not many instances in the PMBOK guide for which 
a single word has two meanings. The case of slack and float is one of the only times 
when two words are used to mean the same thing. There are two types of slack or float: 
free slack or free float, and total slack or total float. Free slack, or free float, indicates the 
amount of time an activity can be delayed before that affects the next activity on the path. 
Total slack, or total float, indicates the amount of time an activity can be delayed before it 
affects the total project duration. If an activity has zero total float, it means if it is delayed, it 
will automatically increase the duration of the project. The critical path or paths through a 
project are those on which there is no slack or float.
In order to complete a full schedule network diagram, you must understand how to 
complete an activity-on-node (AON) diagram. This section takes you through the process 
of completing a schedule network diagram, completing a forward pass to determine the 
project duration, and completing a backward pass to determine the critical path or paths.
To calculate the critical path on an AON diagram, this example uses the node to 
represent the information about the activity. The information contained in the node is 
the task ID, the duration of the activity, the early start (ES), the early finish (EF), the late 
start (LS), the late finish (LF), and the amount of total float in the activity. Figure 4-12 
Figure 4-11.  Network paths

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management

represents a typical node; however, be aware that in the real world and on the exam, 
many different forms of nodes may be used, with information displayed in different 
locations. They all display the same information, just in different ways.
Figure 4-12.  The activity node
Now, if you take the information contained in Table 4-7 and map it out over an entire 
network diagram, you can calculate the project duration and the critical path or paths.

The first step in the process is to construct a network diagram showing the 
relationships between the activities. In this instance, assume that all activities have a 
finish-to-start relationship and there are no leads and lags. Figure 4-13 shows the network 
diagram:
Figure 4-13.  Network diagram example

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
172
By examining this network diagram, you can now write out the paths through the 
diagram as follows:
• 
A-B-D-F-H
• 
A-C-D-F-H
• 
A-C-E-F-H
• 
A-C-E-G-H
The next step in the process is to complete a forward pass. The forward pass is 
completed by working from left to right and calculating the early start and the early finish 
for each task. The earliest a task can start is immediately after the latest early finish of 
all its predecessor activities. For example, if Activity A has an early finish of day 3 (which 
means it finishes at the end of day 3), then Activity B has an early start of day 4 (which 
means it starts at the beginning of day 4). If an activity has more than one predecessor, 
the earliest it can start is immediately after the latest early finish of all its predecessors. 
Figure 4-14 shows the network diagram with the forward pass completed. You can now 
determine that the project duration is 25 days.
Figure 4-14.  Forward pass completed
The next step in the process is to complete a backward pass. This time, you work 
from right to left, and you calculate the late finish and the late start for each activity. When 
calculating the late finish for an activity, you must look to its successor activities; the late 
finish for an activity is immediately prior to the earliest of all successor late start dates. For 
example, if Activity D is the successor to Activity B, and activity D has a late start of day 
12, then Activity B has a late finish of day 11. As you complete the backward pass, you can 
also calculate the total slack for each task by subtracting the late start from the late finish. 
Figure 4-15 shows a completed backward pass.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
173
To calculate which of the paths through the network diagram is the critical path, you 
simply look at all the activities that have zero total float, because these represent activities 
that, if delayed, will affect the total project duration. If you do this, you can determine that 
the critical path in this network diagram is A-C-E-F-H.
Critical Chain Method
The critical chain method is a means of purposely adding in buffer time to identified 
activities, usually on the critical path, to account for limited resources and project 
uncertainties. The amount of buffer is usually worked out by using historical information 
or quantitative risk analysis. The purpose of adding buffer is to ensure that activities 
on the critical path that are identified as important feeder activities—that is, those that 
produce work for successor activities—always have float to ensure that they don’t slip and 
cause the project duration to extend.
■
■Exam Tip  If a question on the exam asks about the application of buffer time, it is 
referring to the critical chain method.
Resource Optimization Techniques
Often, the first pass through any estimate of activity resources—equipment, supplies, or 
people—is what could be referred to as the optimal use of resources. However, this may 
not be the most efficient use of resources, and there may be times when resources are 
either over-allocated or under-allocated. If resources are over-allocated, you may not be 
able to use them; and if they are under-allocated, you may be paying for resources to sit 
around unused. Through the processes of resource leveling and resource smoothing, you 
can attempt to make more efficient use of your resources, but this may have an impact on 
project cost and project duration.
Resource leveling involves moving the allocation of resources between time periods 
to level out periods when a resource will be overused or periods when a resource will be 
underused. For example, you may have forecast one person to be working 60 hours in a 
week, while someone else will work 15 hours. Obviously, after you start moving a resource 
around to get more efficient use, you may end up changing the duration of activities or 
Figure 4-15.  Backward pass completed

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
174
even the sequence of activities. Resource smoothing is a less intensive form of resource 
leveling because it adjusts resources only within the total float for each activity so as not 
to extend the total project duration.
REAL WORLD
Typically, resource leveling is best left to sophisticated project management 
software. If you try to do it manually, you may end up spending too much of your 
time completing it and not obtaining the optimal results.
Modeling Techniques
Modeling techniques typically use computers to present a model of a potential outcome. 
They are particularly useful when you are developing your project schedule, because you 
can examine all potential options and easily find problems or opportunities in the project 
schedule.
A particular type of modeling technique is the what-if scenario analysis. What-if 
scenario analysis is a form of statistical and mathematical analysis that looks at the 
potential probabilities and likely outcomes of different scenarios occurring. For example, 
you may be able to use this technique to analyze what would happen to your project 
schedule if certain events occurred and, from this analysis, choose the scenario that best 
suits your project-duration goals. Of all the what-if scenario analysis techniques, the 
most common is Monte Carlo analysis. Monte Carlo analysis applies statistical analysis to 
examining a possible distribution of outcomes and extrapolates from this the likelihood 
of specific outcomes. Due to its complex use of mathematical modeling, this type of 
analysis is most often performed by a computer.
■
■Exam Tip  On the exam, if a question relates to mathematical analysis of different 
scenarios or the probability of different outcomes, the answer is most likely what-if scenario 
analysis or Monte Carlo analysis.
■
■Note   Origin of Monte Carlo analysis Monte Carlo analysis was used to assist with 
modeling potential effects of the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project. It was 
reportedly so named because the uncle of one of the lead scientists using the method liked 
to gamble at the casino in Monte Carlo.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
175
Leads and Lags
In completing your entire project schedule with the use of a schedule network diagram, 
you may choose to use leads and lags as appropriate to represent either the amount of 
time an activity can start before its predecessor finishes or the amount of time an activity 
must wait after its predecessor ends before starting, respectively.
Schedule Compression
Often the first pass through the development of your project schedule results in an 
optimal timeframe. However, there may be existing schedule constraints, legislation 
requiring a set date for compliance, market conditions, or stakeholder expectations 
that mean your original estimate of total project duration is too long. In this case, you 
need to consider undertaking a variety of schedule compression techniques to shorten 
the duration of the project. The two most common and most often-used techniques are 
crashing and fast tracking. Crashing involves adding extra resources to an activity in order 
to complete it in a shorter time period, which often involves extra cost. Fast tracking 
allows activities that would normally be done in sequence to be done in parallel for all, or 
at least a portion, of their duration. Obviously, the type of dependency between the two 
activities would need to be a discretionary dependency, and you may need to take into 
account extra risk analysis in relation to starting an activity early.
Scheduling Tool
A scheduling tool can be a piece of project management software dedicated entirely 
to project scheduling, or it can be a module of a larger piece of project management 
software, such as Microsoft Project, Primavera, or ProjectLibre, to name just three of the 
hundreds available.
Outputs
The Develop Schedule process produces the following outputs.
Schedule Baseline
The schedule baseline is the final approved version of the project schedule used to track 
actual progress against planned progress.
■
■Exam Tip  Four baselines in project management are used to monitor progress after 
project execution has begun: the scope baseline, the time or schedule baseline, the project 
budget, and the quality baseline. All project baselines form part of the overall project 
management plan, because they provide information about what is intended.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
176
REAL WORLD
The most often-used form of schedule baseline is the Gantt chart. However, be 
aware that the Gantt chart is also an exceptional communications tool. On many 
projects I have worked on, I have used the Gantt chart for both reasons with great 
success. This is because it presents different levels of information graphically, 
which means it is easily understood by both technically minded and non-technically 
minded stakeholders.
Project Schedule
The project schedule can be represented in a number of ways. It is most commonly 
presented graphically by using either a Gantt chart, which is often called a horizontal 
bar chart, or a horizontal histogram. The project schedule can also be represented by a 
milestone chart or, less commonly, by the project schedule network diagram. Figure 4-16 
shows an example of a Gantt chart.
Figure 4-16.  Gantt chart
■
■Note   Origin of the Gantt chart Many people think that Gantt is an acronym for 
something. I once had a student who was absolutely convinced that it stood for graphical 
analysis and numerical tracking tool. I think the student was just making that up, because it 
is actually the surname of Henry Gantt, a mechanical engineer credited with using the chart 
to plot durations on a project.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
177
Schedule Data
The schedule data refers to all the data that makes up the project schedule, and it refers 
to data relating to activity duration estimates, resources, reserves, constraints, and any 
resource leveling undertaken.
Project Calendars
The project calendar refers to the working time available for the project resources over 
the life of the project. If the project calendar is for people, then it may refer to the working 
week; if the project calendar is for machinery, it may refer to a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week 
schedule.
Project Management Plan Updates
The parts of the project management plan that may be updated as a result of developing a 
project schedule are the schedule management plan and the schedule baseline.
Project Document Updates
The types of project documents that may be updated as a result of completing the 
Develop Schedule process iteratively are any of the documents that feed into any part of 
the previous processes, such as activity resource requirements, activity attributes, project 
calendars, or the risk register.

Activities on the critical path have no total float; if they 
are delayed, they will extend the overall project duration. 
Therefore, they represent a high degree of risk on the project.

The Control Schedule process is focused mainly on monitoring any variations 
between what was planned in terms of individual activity durations and the overall 
project duration, and what is actually occurring. It is also focused on documenting any 
requested changes to the project schedule as per the agreed change-control procedure.
The Control Schedule process covers the following monitoring and controlling 
domain task:
• 
Task 1: Measure project performance using appropriate tools and 
techniques, in order to identify and quantify any variances and 
corrective actions.
Inputs
The Control Schedule process uses the following inputs.
Project Management Plan
Obviously, in order to control any process, you need a plan or plans that guide you in 
determining your particular approach to monitoring and controlling. In this instance, 
the project management plan contains the plans and documents that are required to 
control the schedule. Foremost among these are the schedule management plan and the 
schedule baseline. In addition, your change management plan and other subsidiary plans 
will be useful in guiding you in this process. The project management plan is an output 
from the Develop Project Management Plan process.
Project Schedule
The project schedule is an absolutely essential input into the Control Schedule process, 
because you use this to check for any variance. The project schedule outlines what you 
had planned to achieve in terms of time progress on the project. Through your efforts 
of checking this against what is actually happening, you can spot any variances and, as 
a result, raise any requested changes or corrective or preventive actions. The project 
schedule is an output from the Develop Schedule process.
Work Performance Data
Work performance data is the information you gather about progress on the activities 
that have started, what the actual duration is, and the status of any activities considered 
finished. You use this work performance data as a key input into the Control Schedule 
process. Work performance data is an output from the Direct and Manage Project Work 
process.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
180
Project Calendars
Project calendars, which outline the times that the project will carry out the planned 
activity, are useful particularly when there is more than one project calendar assigned to 
different resources being used on the project. Project calendars are an output from the 
Develop Schedule process.
Schedule Data
Schedule data is the raw data used to develop the project schedule model and includes 
the known milestones, activities, activity attributes and, if known, any identified 
constraints and assumptions. You use the schedule data to measure variance of planned 
versus actual. The schedule data is an output from the Develop Schedule process.
Organizational Process Assets
The types of organizational process assets that will be useful as inputs into the Control 
Schedule process are any existing policies or procedures that the organization has 
that assist with measuring and reporting on project schedule progress, any manual or 
automated schedule control tools, and any established reporting templates that can be 
used.
Tools and Techniques
The following tools and techniques can be used on the inputs into the Control Schedule 
process.
Performance Reviews
Performance reviews are the key tool used to control the schedule, because the focus 
is on analyzing what you had planned to do in terms of project schedule performance 
and what you are actually doing. Several techniques can be used as part of applying 
performance reviews. One of these techniques, trend analysis, gathers data about 
your project performance to date and then, by using graphs that extrapolate from this 
information, what likely future performance will be. Another important tool or technique 
used for performance reviews is the critical chain method, which you also saw used as 
a tool in the Develop Schedule process. In the Control Schedule process, it is used to 
continually assess the allocated time buffers against what is actually occurring and to 
make adjustments as necessary.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
181
Project Management Software
Given the in-depth nature of variance analysis and its focus on actual versus planned 
durations and completion of activities, completing the work manually would be tedious 
and inefficient. This is where the use of project management software is very helpful.
REAL WORLD
One of the key tasks I’ve always given to project administrators working on my 
projects is to take responsibility for using the project management software to keep 
track of both time and cost performance on the project. During one particularly 
complex project, I had our wonderful project administrator out on site nearly every 
day, checking what was actually being accomplished and recording this in the 
project management software against what we had planned to do. We were then 
able to use the project management software forecasting abilities to get early 
indicators of where we might end up if we continued at the same pace. This is one 
of the key benefits of using forecasting. A simple forecast of where you might end 
up is not a predetermination of the actual outcome; instead, it should be viewed as a 
warning of what may happen if you continue doing what you have been doing. If the 
results show that you will end up either over budget or over time, you have plenty of 
warning to implement strategies to make sure this doesn’t happen.
Resource Optimization Techniques
After the project is underway and resources are being used to complete activities, you 
may want to use resource optimization techniques and either resource leveling or 
resource smoothing to obtain a more efficient allocation of the resources.
Modeling Techniques
Modeling techniques are used to forecast different schedule scenarios based on the 
different possibilities that could happen with the schedule. The most common one is 
what-if scenario analysis.
The what-if scenario analysis and Monte Carlo analysis are useful mathematical 
tools for forecasting future outcomes based on performance to date. A what-if scenario 
analysis uses known probabilities of work done to date and estimated probabilities of 
potential work paths to be done to calculate the likelihood of all possible scenarios. After 
this has been completed, you can determine the most likely scenarios and judge their 
impact, as well as determine the least likely scenarios and their impact. Monte Carlo 
analysis extrapolates from existing work performance data what likely future outcomes 
will be.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
182
Leads and Lags
In the Develop Schedule process, you also saw this tool used. The purpose of this is to be 
able to adjust leads and lags between activities to more efficiently achieve the expected 
activity duration and total project duration.
Schedule Compression
In the process of examining planned versus actual time performance on the project, 
you may detect that some activities are taking longer than planned, and therefore that 
they threaten the total project duration. At this point, you may want to consider the 
application of schedule-compression techniques to shorten the duration of particular 
activities, a sequence of activities, or the total project. The two most commonly used 
schedule-compression techniques are crashing, which involves the use of more resources 
and usually costs more, and fast tracking, which involves the scheduling of activities in 
parallel that were previously scheduled in sequence.
■
■Exam Tip  On the exam, if any schedule-compression technique being used involves 
more cost, you can be certain that it is referring to crashing. Conversely, if the question 
poses a scenario where you are asked to compress a project schedule but do not have 
access to any more budget, you will not be able to select crashing as an option.
Scheduling Tool
A scheduling tool is a specific piece of software dedicated to project scheduling only. It is 
often part of a more robust piece of project management software such as ProjectLibre, 
Primavera, or Microsoft Project.
■
■Exam Tip  Did you notice that the last five tools listed in the Control Schedule process 
are the same as the last five tools listed in the Develop Schedule process, with the exception 
that the Develop Schedule process uses applying leads and lags as a tool, whereas the 
Control Schedule process uses adjusting leads and lags as a tool?

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
183
Outputs
The Control Schedule process produces the following outputs.
Work Performance Information
As a result of investigating how your project is doing in terms of individual activity 
durations and overall project duration, you will develop work performance information. 
If you recall, work performance data was used as an input into this process, and with 
the application of the selected tools and techniques, that data has been refined into 
work performance information. The work performance information can be presented 
as schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) values for individual 
activities and work packages. The work performance information itself goes on to be used 
as an input into the Monitor and Control Project Work process.
■
■Exam Tip  Work performance data is used to create work performance information, 
which in turn is used to produce work performance reports.
■
■Note   Earned value management In Chapter 5, which focuses on cost management, 
you look in depth at the earned value management system and the associated formula for 
measuring current progress and forecasting likely future progress on a project. Two of the 
indicators you learn about are the schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index 
(SPI) formulas. Both of these formulas and earned value management analysis focus on 
assessing current performance in relation to time and are useful for detecting variance from 
what was planned.
Schedule Forecasts
Schedule forecasts are what you obtain by examining current performance and using this 
to extrapolate likely future performance. Chapter 5 looks in depth at the earned value 
management system. In this system, the formulas for calculating estimate at completion 
(EAC) and estimate to complete (ETC) are useful in forecasting the schedule. Schedule 
forecasts go on to be used as inputs into the Monitor and Control Project Work process.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
184
■
■Note   Estimate at completion As you will read in the next chapter, with its focus on the 
earned value management system, the estimate at completion (EAC) activity is one formula 
that can be calculated many ways. There are different formulas that take into account 
different parameters; if you want to use EAC and take into account the time performance to 
date, you select one of the formulas that uses the schedule performance index (SPI).
REAL WORLD
Usually, immediately after you inform key stakeholders about how well the 
project is going to date, the next question they ask is how well it will go in the 
future. To answer this question, you need to forecast future performance of the 
project. In relation to the time or cost performance, the best way to forecast future 
performance is simply to analyze past performance. I have always used earned 
value management on projects I work on in order to give people an indication—
because that is all it is—of the likely future outcomes based on past performance.
Change Requests
If, during the process of examining actual versus planned performance in relation to 
project time, you discover any variances, one of your options is to submit a change 
request as per your documented and approved change-control process. Change requests 
go on to be used as inputs into the Perform Integrated Change Control process in the 
Integration Management knowledge area.
Project Management Plan Updates
If, as a result of monitoring and controlling the project schedule, you do discover any 
variances, you may choose to update specific elements of the project management plan. 
Of these, the most common updates will be to the schedule management plan and the 
schedule baseline. Given the integrated nature of project management, though, any 
changes to the project schedule may also result in changes to the project cost baseline, 
project risks, project quality, and elements of the project scope. Project management plan 
updates are used in turn as inputs into the Develop Project Plan process.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
185
Project Document Updates
In addition to elements of the project management plan and its subsidiary plans, specific 
project documents may be updated as a result of information gathered during the Control 
Schedule process. You may want to update the project schedule data and, as a result, the 
project schedule.
Organizational Process Asset Updates
Specific organizational process assets that may be updated as a result of the Control 
Schedule process are historical information, lessons learned, records of corrective 
actions, and updates to any organizational templates and policies in order to ensure that 
they are still relevant.

Chapter Summary
• 
The Time Management knowledge area is focused on the 
development and checking of the project schedule.
• 
As with all the other knowledge areas, the Time Management 
knowledge area begins with an initial planning process, which 
in this instance produces the schedule management plan. The 
schedule management plan sets out how you will go about 
completing the planning, execution, and control of the project 
schedule.

Chapter 4 ■ Time Management
186
• 
There is then a five-step iterative process that culminates in the 
development of a project schedule.
• 
The first of these five steps is to define the activities, which are 
a further level of decomposition of already-identified work 
packages from the Scope Management knowledge area.
• 
After the activities have been identified and documented in 
the Define Activities process, they can then be put in sequence 
with the relationships between the activities clearly identified 
and defined. This Sequence Activities process constitutes the 
beginning of the development of the schedule network diagram.
• 
The Estimate Activity Resources process then seeks to provide 
an estimate of the type and quantities of material, people, 
equipment, or supplies that will be required to complete each of 
the activities.
• 
After an estimate of the type and quantities of resources for each 
activity has been prepared, an estimate of the duration of each 
activity can then be completed. This is the main focus of the 
Estimate Activity Durations process.
• 
The Develop Schedule process takes the information from the 
previous four planning processes and combines it into the project 
schedule. Because it is a highly iterative process and subject to 
rolling-wave planning, it may focus more on the immediate future 
and leave further detail to be defined as the project progresses.
• 
After the planning activities have been completed and project 
execution is underway, the Control Schedule process seeks 
to monitor the schedule status of the project and what was 
planned against what is actually occurring by using the schedule 
baseline. Any variances from what was planned can be dealt 
with in a change request, corrective action, or preventive action 
recommendation.

 CHAPTER 5  
 Cost Management 
 This chapter focuses on project cost management. Project cost management, like 
the other knowledge areas, begins with a process of planning that produces a cost 
management plan. Then there is an iterative process that produces and updates the 
cost estimates and cost baseline. After these have been developed, a monitoring and 
controlling process is used to measure actual versus planned cost performance and to 
manage any change requests. 
 You may need to pay particular attention in this chapter to the activities involved 
in calculating earned value management, because there is quite a bit of technical 
information you need to learn. 
 The PMBOK  ®   Guide Processes 
 Project Cost Management Knowledge Area 
 The four  processes in the Project Cost Management knowledge area are as follows:
• 
  Plan Cost Management (planning process)  
• 
  Estimate Costs (planning process) 
• 
  Determine Budget (planning process) 
• 
  Control Costs (monitoring and controlling process)    
 What Is Project Cost Management? 
 Project  cost  management is focused on the processes of developing a cost management 
plan, the processes of estimating costs for activities and the overall project, preparing 
your project budget or cost baseline, recording performance, and influencing and 
assessing any changes to the project budget. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Although presented as discrete processes, the two processes of estimating 
costs and determining budget are usually done concurrently. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
200
 The processes contained in this knowledge area present a logical and sequential flow 
of information from estimating costs through controlling changes to your project budget. 
Figure  5-1  shows the general flow through this linear process without the general initial 
Plan Cost Management process. 
 
REAL WORLD
 I have always found that developing the project cost estimates and the approved 
cost budget is one of the most iterative parts of project management. You start 
out with high-level estimates based on incomplete information and constantly 
revise and refine both the information you have and the estimates based on the 
information. When you check how progress is going, you may need to revisit your 
estimates and revise individual cost estimates. Because of this iterative nature and 
the high expectations of stakeholders regarding project costs, I pay extra attention to 
the cost management processes. 
 Plan Cost Management

■ Exam Tip   Did you notice that the inputs, tools, and techniques for the Plan Cost 
Management process are identical to the inputs, tools, and techniques for the Plan Schedule 
Management process? The only difference between the two processes is the single output. 
 The Plan Cost Management process is a planning process with a single output: the 
cost management plan. Like all other planning documents, the cost management plan 
guides your efforts in defining and controlling the project budget. It forms a subsidiary 
plan to the overall project management plan. 
 The Plan Cost Management process covers the following  planning domain task :
• 
 Task 3: Develop the cost management plan based on the project 
scope, schedule, resources, approved project charter and other 
information, using estimating techniques, in order to manage 
project costs. 
 Inputs 
 The Plan Cost Management process uses some or all of the following inputs as part of the 
development of the cost management plan for the project. 
 Project Management Plan 
 The distinct elements of the project management plan that are useful in developing 
your own cost management plan are the scope and schedule information contained 
in the scope baseline and schedule baseline, respectively. After it is created, the 
cost management plan becomes part of the project management plan. The project 
management plan is an output from the Develop Project Management Plan process. 
 Project Charter 
 The  project charter contains the approved initial budget for the project at the time of 
project initiation. It also contains known constraints, assumptions, and risks that may 
affect project costs and their management. The project charter is an output from the 
Develop Project Charter process. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
202
 Enterprise Environmental Factors 
 Particular  enterprise environmental factors that may assist with development of your 
cost management plan include the particular organizational culture and structure, any 
external market conditions that may affect project costs, and any published commercially 
available cost information that you may use to develop and check your cost estimates.  
 Organizational Process  Assets 
 Organizational process assets that may play an important part in the development of your 
cost management plan include any historical information and any established financial 
control procedures, policies, and templates for defining and controlling project costs and 
budget. 
 
■ Exam Tip   It is important to note that in your day-to-day work you may use the terms 
 cost and  budget interchangeably. However, for the purposes of this exam, you must 
understand that the two words have separate meanings.  Cost refers to the actual costs of 
each activity or work package, which, when aggregated, form a total project cost.  Budget , 
on the other hand, refers to costs over time. 
 
REAL WORLD
 One way to keep your accounts people very happy is to be proactive with the 
development of your project budget. If you are able to tell them clearly when you 
expect to spend money and when you expect to have money come in, they can 
better plan the organization’s cash flow requirements. It is important to realize that 
as a project manager, your project may impose serious cash flow problems on the 
wider organization, and the accounts people have to figure out how to make sure 
money is available when you need it. I have always found that giving the accounts 
people information early and often about when I plan to use money is a great way to 
manage this particular group of stakeholders. 
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques are available to be used to develop the inputs into this 
process in order to produce the  cost management plan. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
203
 Expert Judgment 
 Expert judgment is used as a tool and technique in the Plan Cost Management process 
as again you rely on the experience, opinion, and expertise of individuals to assist with 
the development of a cost management plan. The experts you consult may be members 
of your project team, other employees in your organization, or people from outside 
your organization with particular experience in putting together an appropriate cost 
management plan . 
 Analytical Techniques 
 Analytical techniques are an important tool in the development of your cost management 
plan because you or your financial department must analyze options and make decisions 
about how the project will be funded. You may be able to fund the project with cash 
reserves, bank loans, funding with equity from shareholders, or funding with debt from 
other sources. Each of these options has its own benefits and drawbacks. In making 
the decision, you can use a number of techniques such as payback period, return on 
investment, internal rate of return, discounted cash flow, and net present value. Each of 
these terms was discussed in more detail in the Develop Project Charter process as part of 
the project selection process. 
 
REAL WORLD
 I have found that many project managers are completely oblivious to how the 
project is going to be funded. I believe an important skill that any project manager 
should have is an understanding of project financing methods and the implications 
of different finance sources for project costs. One of the first places to look for 
guidance about funding criteria and sources of potential funding is the project 
charter. 
 Meetings 
 Meetings  are a great way to bring together members of the project team who have 
expertise and skill in development of the cost management plan, because they are the 
people completing the work. You may also choose to invite selected stakeholders from 
outside the project team who have specialist knowledge and skills in this particular area. 
An example would be inviting members of your organization’s financial or accounts 
department to contribute to the development of the cost management plan. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
204
 Outputs 
 After the appropriate tools and techniques have been applied to the selected inputs, the 
Plan Cost Management process has the following output. 
 Cost Management Plan 
 The Plan Cost Management process has only a single output: the cost management 
plan. The  cost management plan is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan 
and is used as a guide for the other cost management processes. The purpose of the cost 
management plan is to provide guidance to the project manager and the project team 
on how the organization expects costs to be estimated, budgets to be determined, cost 
performance to be assessed, and any potential changes assessed, documented, and 
reported on. It also outlines the process of reporting progress in relation to forecast cost 
versus actual cost for the project and prescribes acceptable tools, techniques, processes, 
and any other relevant information relating to how costs will be managed on the project. 
 The cost management plan is then a key input into the Estimate Costs and 
Determine Budget  processes , both of which are planning processes.

■ More Info   Estimate Costs 
 You can read more about  the  Estimate Costs process in the PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, in

 The Estimate Costs process is a planning process that uses the cost management 
plan for guidance, takes the defined activities and work packages, and assigns a cost 
estimate for each one using a variety of tools and techniques. In order to easily track 
which estimates are for which particular work package, you can use the numbering 
systems from the work breakdown structure (WBS). This is a highly iterative process that 
is repeated throughout the life of the project. 
 The Estimate Costs process covers the following  planning domain task :
• 
  Task 3: Develop the cost management plan based on the project 
scope, schedule, resources, approved project charter and other 
information, using estimating techniques, in order to manage 
project costs. 
 In assessing the estimate for each activity, it is important to have a basic 
understanding of different types of costs that may be estimated. 
 Variable costs are costs that change with the amount of production. The more you 
produce, the more costs you incur. For example, if you increase the number of homes you 
are building, you will use more home-building materials. If you use more electricity as a 
result of greater amounts of work, then your costs will increase. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
206
 Fixed costs  are costs that are fixed no matter how much you produce. For example, 
the rental you pay for your warehouse storage space is constant whether the warehouse is 
full or empty. Also, the costs you pay for any consents you require or equipment needed 
to complete the job are fixed costs. 
 Direct costs  are costs attributable directly to the actions of the project. For example, 
the materials you use on your project are direct costs. 
 Indirect costs are costs that are not incurred directly by the project but that the project 
may have to account for. For example, the project may have to make provision for paying 
a share of corporate overheads such as office rental space and shared services. Your cost 
management plan may contain guidelines on what portion, if any, of indirect costs you 
must account for in your cost estimates. These are often referred to as  overheads . 
 
REAL WORLD
 Indirect costs, or overheads, are often overlooked by project managers when 
preparing their cost estimates. Unless there are clear guidelines from the 
organization about what portion, if any, of indirect costs the project must account for, 
many project managers simply do not think about this. Many organizations account 
for indirect costs in required margins or profits. Hopefully, your organizational 
process assets include guidance on how you are expected to manage this issue. 
 Sunk costs  are costs spent on the project to date that cannot be recovered if the 
project were to stop. For example, the money you have spent developing code for a new 
piece of software is a sunk cost if you stop halfway through, because it has no recoverable 
value. Your cost management plan may contain guidelines on how sunk costs are treated 
in determining whether to continue on a troubled project. 
 All estimates are simply your best guess at the future, based on the information 
available to you. The better the information you have, the better the estimates will be. 
Thus, there is nearly always an element of uncertainty inherent in any estimate. It is 
often important to express this range of uncertainty inherent in any estimate. As a rule, 
the accuracy of cost estimates improves as the project progresses, and your organization 
may have, as part of its organizational process assets, guidelines on the necessary level of 
accuracy required before proceeding. Table  5-3 shows the typical description of a variety 
of  estimate ranges .  

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
207
 Inputs 
 The Estimate Costs process uses some or all of the following seven inputs. 
 Cost Management Plan 
 The  cost management plan is obviously a key input into the Estimate Costs process, 
because it provides the guidance for how you are going to complete this process. Without 
it, you would not be able to complete the process. The cost management plan is an output 
from the Develop Cost Management Plan process. 
 Human Resource Management Plan 
 The  human resource management plan is used as an input into the Estimate Costs process 
because it contains information about the project staff who will be working on the project 
and the charge-out rates, remuneration packages, and any other financial rewards to be 
paid to them. In order to develop the project cost, you need to know this information. 
The human resource management plan is an output from the Plan Human Resource 
Management process. 
 Scope Baseline 
 The  scope baseline is composed of the project scope statement, the work breakdown 
structure (WBS), and the WBS dictionary, and it contains a full and detailed description of 
all the work to be done on the project. By using this information, you can attribute costs 
to each of the work packages and also the activities taken from the project schedule, and 
aggregate these costs into a total project cost estimate. The scope baseline is an output 
from the Create WBS process.

 Definitive estimate 
 -15% to +20% 
 Control estimate 
 -10% to +15% 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
208
 Project Schedule 
 The  project schedule  is an important input into the Estimate Costs process because it 
gives an indication of when the work packages and activities are to be completed. The 
sequencing, timing, and duration of distinct project work packages and activities affect 
the costs. The project schedule is an output from the Develop Project Schedule process, 
which in itself is the culmination of the other schedule management planning processes. 
 Risk Register 
 The  risk register  is used as an input into the Estimate Costs process because it contains 
information around defined and documented uncertainty relating to specific work 
packages. This uncertainty is captured in the contingency reserve for each activity work 
package and needs to be taken into account in developing the project cost estimates. The 
risk register is an output from the Identify Risks process. 
 Enterprise Environmental Factors 
 The specific types of  enterprise environmental factors that are useful as inputs into 
the Estimate Costs process are external market conditions that will affect the prices of 
products and services being procured for the project, and any published commercially 
available estimating data. 
 
REAL WORLD
 It is worthwhile to carefully subscribe to, and pay for access to, reputable published 
estimating databases. These databases are usually very accurate sources of 
information about the costs of particular materials and resources, and they are 
often separated into regional areas to determine variances at a local level. Many 
organizations, industry associations, and professional bodies compile these 
databases and allow access for a fee. 
 Organizational Process Assets 
 The specific types of  organizational process assets that are useful as inputs into 
the Estimate Costs process are any relevant templates and processes useful in the 
development of project cost estimates, including any historical information and lessons 
learned owned by the organization. 
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following ten tools and techniques are used on the inputs to deliver the process 
outputs. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
209
 Expert Judgment 
 The use of experts is an acknowledged tool in the preparation of project cost estimates. 
The experts, or people working on the project, have intimate knowledge of the work to 
be done and the likely cost of that work. In addition to project team members with expert 
judgment on the work to be done, you may also choose to consult external experts, such 
as those involved in the quantity surveying profession, who can provide expert advice on 
the expected costs of materials and resources to be used. 
 Analogous Estimating 
 Analogous estimating is a quick means of estimating a likely cost for a particular material 
or resource by comparing your current requirements with the requirements of a previous 
project you have information on, and then looking at the similarities between the two 
instances to determine your current estimate. For example, if on a previous project you 
used a particular amount of concrete and it cost $1,500, and on this project you expect 
to use twice as much, you would assume that your cost estimate is $3,000, by using 
analogous estimating. Because you are using an analogy from previous experience, there 
is a certain degree of expected inaccuracy in this form of estimating. 
 Parametric Estimating 
 Parametric estimating is generally considered to be more accurate than analogous 
estimating because it uses known quantities of materials for resources and multiplies 
them by known financial rates. For example, you may know that you require 50 hours 
of work to be done by a business analyst, and that a business analyst costs $80 an hour; 
therefore, multiplying 50 hours by $80 an hour, you will arrive at a cost estimate of $4,000 
by using  parametric estimating. 
 Bottom-Up Estimating 
 Bottom-up estimating is generally considered to be quite an accurate form of estimating. 
You take cost estimates from lower-level information—for example, the bottom level of 
the WBS—and then add up, or roll up, to higher levels and aggregate those costs to report 
a total cost.  
 Three-Point Estimating 
 You saw the use of  three-point estimating in the Estimate Activity Durations process 
from the Schedule Management knowledge area. Here it is used again as a method of 
determining an estimate where there is a most likely (cM), an optimistic (cO), and a 
pessimistic (cP) cost estimate for an activity. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
210
 
■ Exam Tip   Although the correct name for the formula is the  three-point estimate , and it 
is part of the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT), it is often simply called the 
 PERT formula . 
 To get a  simple average, which is used with a triangular distribution, you take these 
three figures and add them together and divide by 3. The formula is
 
cO
cM
cP


3
 
 However, if you want to get a  weighted average that gives greater weight to the most 
likely (cM) figure and is typical of a beta distribution, the formula to use is
 
cO
xcM
cP





6
 
 For example, if you have an optimistic cost estimate of $10, a most likely cost 
estimate of $16, and a pessimistic cost estimate of $25, the weighted average using three-
point estimating is $16.50. 
 You can also calculate the standard deviation, which indicates how far from the 
average the optimistic and pessimistic figures are. A smaller standard deviation means 
they are closer to the average than a larger standard deviation. The formula for standard 
deviation is
 
cP
Co

6
 
 For example, using the numbers from the previous example, the standard deviation 
is $2.50. 
 After you have determined the standard deviation, you can then express your 
certainty about a cost estimate range. You express this certainty as a confidence 
interval, where one standard deviation either side of the mean represents a confidence 
interval of 68%, two standard deviations either side of the mean gives a confidence 
interval of 95%, and three standard deviations either side of the mean gives a 
confidence interval of 99.7%. 
 For example, using the numbers from the previous example, you could say that you 
have a 95% certainty that the cost for the activity will be between $11.50 and $21.50. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
211
 
REAL WORLD
 In reality, when you are completing any sort of estimating process in the project, 
you will use a variety of estimating techniques. The type of estimating technique 
you choose to use will depend on how much information you have. At the beginning 
of a project, when information is generally less available, you may choose to use 
less accurate forms of estimating. As the project progresses and you have more 
information available, you may choose to use more accurate and time-consuming 
forms of estimating for work you have greater information about. In relation to 
rolling-wave planning, you will most likely use more accurate forms of estimating on 
the work to be done in the immediate future and less accurate forms of estimating 
on work to be done further off in the future. 
 Reserve Analysis 
 Reserve analysis looks at the contingency reserves, or contingency allowances, provided 
for in the project cost estimates. The contingency reserve is an amount that reflects and 
allows for identified uncertainty in estimating particular costs. It is commonly known as 
“accounting for the known unknowns” in any project and is usually calculated during 
quantitative risk analysis performed as part of the Risk Management knowledge area. For 
example, you may determine that a particular activity has a 10% chance of experiencing 
a $1,750 cost overrun, and therefore you allow $175 ($1,750 × 10%) in the contingency 
reserve. By aggregating, or adding up, all the individual amounts allowed for in the 
contingency reserve analysis, you arrive at a total contingency reserve for the entire 
project. 
 The management reserve for unknown unknowns can also be calculated during risk 
assessment or by expressing the range of uncertainty in your estimates as a total amount. 
The management reserve is controlled by senior managers, and the project manager 
must apply to use it; it is not part of the approved budget. 
 
REAL WORLD
 In theory, the contingency reserve should be part of the approved project budget and 
under the control of the project manager, and the management reserve should be 
under the control of senior management or members of the steering group. In reality, 
you may find that your approved budget is just for known costs and that sponsors 
can sometimes be reluctant to approve reserve budgets, because they view it as 
endorsing inaccuracy and sloppy estimating practices. My argument is that I prefer 
to go forward on a “no surprises” basis and release the reserves once the identified 
uncertainty has been defined or passed. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
212
 Cost of Quality 
 As part of the preparation of your quality management plan, you need to consider the issue 
of cost of quality. Any decisions made about what this means to you will affect cost on the 
project immediately and for the organization after the project is handed over.  Cost of quality 
refers to the quality attributes of the project and the product over the life of the product. For 
example, you may need to take into account the cost of future product returns or warranty 
claims because of decisions made to manufacture lower quality to lower the project costs.  
 Project Management Software 
 Project management software should be considered essential for any large and complex 
projects, because trying to collect and aggregate many cost estimates manually is simply 
not possible.  
 Vendor Bid Analysis 
 The  vendor bid analysis process is a way of double-checking the bids received from 
vendors to make sure they are neither overinflated nor underinflated. You can think of 
vendor bid analysis as your quality check on the prices people are submitting to you. 
 Group Decision-Making Techniques 
 Good cost estimates are prepared by people familiar with the activities being estimated, 
and when you get a group of these people together, you need effective group decision-
making techniques to make sense of the expert opinions supplied. These techniques are 
also used when estimating elements of the project schedule and include brainstorming, 
nominal group techniques, and the Delphi technique. 
 Outputs 
 The Estimate Costs process produces some or all of the following outputs. 
 Activity Cost Estimates 
 The  activity cost estimates are the individual estimates for each activity identified. They 
are the entire focus of this process and are used to put together your cost baseline. The 
activity cost estimates are used as an input into the Determine Budget process. 
 Basis of Estimates 
 The  basis of estimates is a useful document because it outlines the assumptions made, the 
type of estimating technique used, any known constraints, and an indication of the range 
of uncertainty and of the confidence level of the final estimates for each activity and, 
indeed, the entire project. The basis of estimates is used as an input into the Determine 
Budget process. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
213
 
■ Exam Tip   Several supporting documents provide additional information to summary 
documents. For the requirements documentation, you have the requirements traceability 
matrix. For the WBS, you have the WBS dictionary. For the activity list, you have the activity 
attributes. For the activity cost estimates, you have the basis of estimates. The summary 
document and the document containing greater detail are both important to provide a full 
picture. 
 Project Document Updates 
 The specific project  documents that may be updated as a result of estimating costs 
include such things as the statement of work, which may be updated as a result of the 
cost estimates, and elements of the risk register that are refined and updated as a result of 
specific cost estimates. 
 Quick Check 
 
 1. 
 What is the difference between a simple average and a 
weighted average? 
 
 2. 
 What is the difference between a contingency reserve and a 
management reserve? 
 
 3. 
 What information does the basis of estimates contain? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
  A simple average divides the most likely (cM), the optimistic 
(cO), and the pessimistic (cP) cost estimates by 3, whereas 
a weighted average gives a higher weighting of 4 to the most 
likely cost estimate and then divides by 6.  
 
 2. 
 A contingency reserve is prepared for the known uncertainty, 
or known unknowns, on a project and should be under 
the control of the project manager. A management reserve 
is prepared for the unknown uncertainty, for unknown 
unknowns, and is generally under the control of senior 
management. 
 
 3. 
  The basis of estimates contains information about the 
assumptions made in preparing cost estimates, the types of 
estimating techniques used, and the amount of uncertainty in 
the final activity cost estimates.

 The Determine Budget process is a planning process that takes the individual activity 
cost estimates, aggregates them into a total project cost, and then applies the project 
schedule to determine the timing of when costs will be incurred in order to develop the 
project budget, or cost baseline. 
 The Determine Budget process covers the following  planning domain task  :
• 
 Task 3: Develop the cost management plan based on the project 
scope, schedule, resources, approved project charter and other 
information, using estimating techniques, in order to manage 
project costs. 
 Inputs 
 The inputs used in this process take the individual cost estimates and aggregate them into 
the project budget. 
 Cost Management Plan 
 The  cost management plan is used as a key input into the Determine Budget process 
because the cost management plan sets out the processes, policies, rules, and regulations 
that you will apply in order to determine a project budget. The cost management plan is 
an output from the Plan Cost Management process. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
215
 Scope Baseline 
 The  scope baseline is a very important input into this process because it outlines all the 
work to be done, and the work not to be done, as part of the project. By breaking down the 
scope baseline into its component parts via the WBS and subsequently down to activity 
level with the schedule of work, you can estimate individual activity costs. The scope 
baseline consists of the project scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS dictionary, and it 
is an output from the Create WBS process. 
 Activity Cost Estimates 
 The  activity cost estimates provide you with individual estimates of cost for identified 
activities by using a variety of tools and techniques from the Estimate Costs process. In 
order to put together your project budget, you take these individual activity estimates, 
aggregate them, and determine the time period in which those costs will be incurred. The 
activity cost estimates are an output from the Estimate Costs process.     
 Basis of Estimates 
 The  basis of estimates is an important input because it provides further information 
about each of the estimates you have determined for the individual activities. The basis of 
estimates is an output from the Estimate Costs process.  
 Project  Schedule  
 The  project schedule is used as an input into the Determine Budget process because you 
need to know when each activity will be performed so that you can determine when the 
costs of activity will be incurred. This is the essence of developing a project budget: taking 
the project costs and applying them over time. The project schedule is an output from the 
Develop Schedule process. 
 Resource Calendars 
 Resource calendars are used as an input into the Determine Budget process because 
they provide additional and more detailed information about when specific resources 
are available to work on the project. They are an output from the Acquire Project Team 
process. 
 Risk Register 
 The  risk register is used as an input into this process because it identifies risks associated 
with both individual activity cost estimates and elements of the project schedule that 
need to be taken into account when developing the project budget. It is an output from 
the Identify Risks process. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
216
 Agreements 
 Any existing  agreements are used by the project manager as an input into this process 
because they outline any agreement between parties to the project about costs, 
payments, and any other matters, such as retention payments, that need to be included 
in the project budget. For example, you may have an agreement for paying suppliers that 
requires payment regularly each month, or one that requires progress payments at certain 
project milestones. These agreements are an output from the Conduct Procurements 
process. 
 Organizational Process Assets 
 The specific  organizational process assets  that can assist in the development of the 
project budget include any organizational policies and procedures relating to the 
development and presentation of the project budget, and any blank templates for 
preparing budgets and for reporting the budget. 
 Tools and  Techniques 
 The five tools and techniques of this process are all used on the separate inputs to deliver 
the process outputs. 
 Cost Aggregation 
 Cost aggregation is the process of taking the individual estimates for each of the activities, 
aggregating upward to the work package level, and then rolling these estimates up to 
high-level, sub-deliverable level, and deliverable level to arrive at a bottom-up estimate 
for portions of the project or the entire project. Figure  5-2 shows how individual activities 
are added up, or aggregated. 
 Figure 5-2.  An example of bottom-up cost aggregation 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
217
 Reserve Analysis 
 Reserve analysis is a method of looking at both the contingency reserve and the 
management reserve required for the project and the timing of access to those reserves. 
Contingency reserves are identified for specific uncertain activities, or known unknowns; 
access to the contingency reserve will be when the activity is being performed. The 
contingency reserve is approved as part of the project budget and is under the control of 
the project manager. 
 Access to the management reserve, which is for unknown unknowns, could be 
required at any time in the project. Use of the management reserve requires approval 
from management; once approved, it is added to the cost baseline. 
 Expert Judgment 
 Again,  expert judgment is a key tool and technique in determining the budget. The 
experts should be from the project team and also from outside the project team: for 
example, from the organization’s finance or accounts department. 
 Historical Relationships 
 If the organization is mature enough to have been recording information about  historical 
relationships and the reliability and range of uncertainty in its cost estimating process, it 
can use this information to further refine its current cost estimates or to acknowledge a 
quantifiable amount of uncertainty in those estimates.  
 Funding Limit Reconciliation 
 As part of the Determine Budget process, you may find that there are   funding limit 
reconciliation issues that need to be considered. For example, you may want to do more 
work but simply will not have the funds until a later time; therefore, you have to limit the 
activity on the project until funds to complete the work become available. 
 
REAL WORLD
 It is important that you are able to determine how the project will be funded early on, 
and whether this funding process imposes any constraints on your project schedule. 
I have often found that there are constraints on when funds will be available, which 
is generally related to the financial years into which the funds are allocated. This 
is why the finance department of an organization is so interested in how much of 
your project budget you are spending, how much you are carrying over to the next 
financial year, and how much you want to bring forward into this financial year. You 
may not realize that someone has to find the finances to complete not only your 
project but all other projects the organization is completing. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
218
 Outputs 
 The major outputs from the Determine Budget process are the following. 
 Cost Baseline 
 The  cost baseline  is one of four baselines you will use to measure progress on the project. 
The other three are the scope baseline, the time baseline, and the quality baseline. The 
key element of the cost baseline is that it takes the aggregated individual estimates of cost 
for each activity and applies them to the time periods in which the costs will be accrued. 
This is the baseline against which you will measure project cost performance. Figure  5-3 
shows an example of a cost baseline represented graphically. It shows the total amount of 
spend for each time period, in this case in months. Additionally, it shows the cumulative 
spend over the life of the project. This is represented by the line, which is often referred 
to as the  S-curve because it is in the shape of the letter  S . There is little spend at the 
beginning of a project, a lot of spend in the middle section of the project, and a decrease 
in spending toward the end of the project. 
 Figure 5-3.  An example of a  cost baseline 
 
■ Exam Tip   Individual contingency reserve figures are added to the individual activity 
cost estimates. These are then aggregated and rolled up to work-package level, with 
the aggregated contingency reserve applied against individual work packages. The 
management reserve is added to the total cost baseline once management has approved its 
use. The only way you can use funds from the management reserve is to obtain approval by 
the documented and approved change-control process. 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
219
 Project Funding Requirements 
 The  project funding requirements acknowledge when the funding for the project will be 
available: for example, annually, quarterly, or monthly. This recognizes that funding for 
a project often occurs in incremental amounts, whereas expenditure on a project may be 
continuous. 
 
REAL WORLD
 Matching when funds will be available against when money will be spent is an 
important aspect of sound and prudent financial management for the project. You 
do not want to be in a situation where you have spent more than your ability to 
pay, because this may mean delays in paying creditors and ultimately delays to the 
project. 
 Project Document  Updates  
 The types of project  documents that may be updated as a result of the Determine Budget 
process are the individual cost estimates, project schedule, and risk register. 
 Quick Check 
 
 1. 
 Why is the project schedule an important input into the 
Determine Budget process? 
 
 2. 
  How would you describe cost aggregation? 
 
 3. 
  Why are funding limit reconciliations and the project funding 
requirements important aspects of any project cost baseline? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 The project schedule allows you to view the time period in 
which the project activities will be performed and their costs 
incurred. 
 
 2. 
  Cost aggregation is the process of adding up individual 
activity cost estimates up to the work-package level, then the 
sub-deliverable level, and then the deliverable level. 
 
 3. 
 Both the technique of funding limit reconciliation and the 
output of project funding requirements recognize that funds 
for the project may be incremental, whereas spending may be 
continuous, and therefore sometimes there are not enough 
funds to pay accrued expenses.

 Control Costs 
 
■ More Info   Control Costs 
 You can read more about  the  Control Costs process in the PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, in 
Chapter   7  , section 7.4. Table  5-5 identifies the process inputs, tools and techniques, and 
outputs.

■ Exam Tip   Did you notice that the outputs from the Control Costs process are the same 
as the outputs from the Control Schedule process, with the exception of the cost forecasts 
instead of schedule forecasts?  
 The  Control Costs  process is focused mainly on measuring actual against planned 
cost performance, forecasting likely future cost performance, and managing any changes 
to the cost baseline. The Control Costs process covers the following  monitoring and 
controlling domain task :
• 
 Task 1: Measure project performance using appropriate tools and 
techniques, in order to identify and quantify any variances and 
corrective actions. 
 Inputs 
 The Control Costs process uses the following inputs. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
221
 Project Management Plan 
 The  project management plan and its subsidiary plans guide you in the process of 
controlling any potential changes to your cost baseline or any of the individual estimates 
that were prepared. As such, it is an important input into the Control Costs process. 
The project management plan is an output from the Develop Project Management Plan 
process. 
 Project Funding Requirements 
 The  project funding requirements are an important input into the Control Costs process 
because they enable you to determine when expenditures will be incurred and when 
funding for the project will be available, and to therefore assess actual versus planned 
project funding requirements and control any changes to these elements. The project 
funding requirements are an output from the Determine Budget process. 
 Work Performance Data 
 By now you should have picked up that  work performance data is an important input into 
several controlling processes. Work performance data is the information you gather about 
what is actually occurring on the project down to the level of which activities have started, 
the costs associated with completing those activities, and any estimates for completing 
the remainder of the work to be done. Work performance data is an output from the 
Direct and Manage Project Work process. 
 Organizational Process Assets 
 The types of  organizational process assets that are useful as inputs into the Control Costs 
process are any existing organizational policies, procedures, templates, or other elements 
relating to how costs will be monitored and reported on in your project.   
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques can be used on the inputs into the Control Costs 
process. 
 Earned Value Management 
 The earned value  management  ( EVM) system provides an effective and efficient way of 
to establish what has occurred in the past and to use this information to forecast likely 
future scenarios by using a range of mathematical equations. It is better than simply 
taking one or two elements of past performance and expecting that performance to 
continue. For example, imagine that you are a project sponsor, and your project manager 
tells you that the project is 50% of the way through and has spent only 40% of the budget. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
222
Is this a good situation? It may be, but without knowing how much of the actual work has 
been completed and how much value has been earned, you don’t really know if this is a 
positive statement. This is exactly the scenario that EVM can get around. 
 EVM takes the original  project cost baseline , the planned value of the work you had 
expected to have completed by now, the earned value of the work you have completed, 
and the actual cost of delivering that value, to determine the project cost and schedule 
performance to date and then forecast the likely costs at completion. It does this by using 
the following formulas:
• 
 Budget at completion (BAC) : The original forecast budget for 
the project. The BAC is also the total planned value (PV) for the 
project. 
• 
 Planned value (PV) : The amount of value you should have earned 
by this time in the project. Because the total PV for a project 
equals the BAC, you can determine the PV by simply determining 
how far through the project you are in relation to time, and 
mapping this back to the approved cost baseline. Figure  5-4 
demonstrates how to determine the PV from the BAC.  
 Figure 5-4.  The project cost baseline showing PV and BAC 
 If you do not have a cost baseline from which to read PV, the 
easiest way to determine PV is to calculate the percentage of time 
that has been completed and multiply the BAC by this. If you 
have completed 7 months of a 10-month project and the BAC is 
$50,000, then your PV is 70% of $50,000, which equals $35,000. 
Obviously this method assumes a linear spend on the project 
instead of the S-curve you normally see. 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
223
• 
 Earned value (EV) : The value of the work that has been 
completed. This is not the actual cost of the work that has been 
completed but rather the original ascribed value from your 
approved cost baseline for the value of the work. 
• 
 Actual cost (AC) : The actual realized cost incurred for the work 
done to date. You can get a record of this from your accounts 
system. 
• 
 Figure  5-5 shows the BAC, PV, EV, and AC on a single graph. 
Incidentally, it shows a project in trouble in terms of both time 
and cost: the AC is above the PV, and the EV is less than the PV.     
 Figure 5-5.    A record of project planned value, earned value, and actual cost 
 
■ Exam Tip   On most questions, you will be challenged to extract the BAC, PV, EV, and AC 
from the scenario given. Take your time to ensure that you are extracting the correct figures. 
 
REAL WORLD
 I’ve often found that when calculating the actual cost, it is important to remove from 
this calculation the value of any material held in stock. On some projects, you may 
decide to procure a lot of required materials early to avoid potential cost increases 
over time. Therefore, you will have paid for these materials, and this shows up in 
your accounts. However, incorporating this amount into your actual cost figure for 
the purposes of EVM will skew the results negatively. Therefore, I recommend that 
you do regular stock takes and remove the value of material held in stock from the 
actual cost figure you use for the EVM calculations. 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
224
• 
 Cost variance (CV) : The difference between the value of what 
you expected to have earned (EV) at this point and the AC at this 
point. A positive CV is good and shows that the project is under 
budget. A negative CV is bad and shows that the project is over 
budget. The formula is 
 CV = EV – AC 
• 
 Cost performance index (CPI) : One limitation of the CV equation 
is that it gives you a simple gross figure. You can’t tell whether a 
$10,000 CV is significant on your project. If you are working on a 
$50,000 project, it is significant; if you are working on a $10 million 
contract, it may not be as significant. The CPI calculation tells 
you the magnitude of the variance. A CPI of more than 1 is good, 
because it means the project is under budget; a CPI of less than 1 
is bad, because it means the project is over budget. For example, 
if you have a CPI of 1.1, it means for every dollar you spend on the 
project, you are getting a $1.10 return. The formula is 
 CPI = EV/AC 
• 
 Schedule variance (SV) : Tells you whether you are ahead or 
behind your planned schedule. It is the difference between the 
EV and the PV. A positive SV is good and means you are ahead 
of schedule; a negative SV is bad and means you are behind 
schedule. The formula is 
 SV = EV – PV 
• 
 Schedule performance index (SPI) : A ratio of the EV and PV that 
allows you to better determine the magnitude of any variance. An 
SPI of more than 1 is good, because it means the project is ahead 
of time; an SPI of less than 1 is bad, because it means the project is 
behind schedule. For example, if you have an SPI of 0.95, it means 
every day you spend working on the project, you are getting a 0.95 
day return. The formula is 
 SPI = EV/PV 
 
■ Exam Tip   A quick and easy way to remember the formula for CV, CPI, SP, and SPI is that 
each of the formula starts with EV. If it is a formula relating to variance (CV or SV), then the 
next symbol is a minus sign. If it is a formula relating to a performance index (CPI or SPI), 
then the next symbol is a division sign. If the formula is in relation to cost (CV or CPI), then 
the final part of the formula is AC. If the formula is in relation to schedule (SV or SPI), then 
the final part of the formula is PV. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
225
 Forecasting 
 Forecasting is the process of taking time and cost performance to date and using 
this information to forecast a likely future scenario. The time and cost performance 
measurements are the cost variance (CV), schedule variance (SV), cost performance 
index (CPI), and schedule performance index (SPI). You can use these measurements 
and the following formulas to forecast a likely project cost at completion, the amount of 
money required to complete the project, and the difference between what you originally 
thought it would cost and what you now think it will cost:
• 
 Estimate at completion (EAC): There are many ways to calculate a 
forecast EAC. Keep in mind that in order to forecast a likely future 
cost or time frame for the project, you will be using historical 
information. Therefore, the quality of your EAC calculation 
depends entirely on the quality of the historical information you 
use. The following four formulas use different inputs to calculate 
the EAC. Each one gives a different answer for the same project. 
 EAC = BAC/CPI: This is perhaps the simplest of the EAC 
calculations because it takes your original BAC and divides 
that by your CPI. Obviously, this is a useful calculation if 
your cost performance to date is indicative of your likely cost 
performance going forward; by the same measure, it will not be 
a great calculation to use if your cost performance to date is not 
indicative of your cost performance in the future. 
 EAC = AC+ ETC: Simply adding your ETC to your AC spent to date 
is an effective way to determine your EAC. However, the method 
by which you determine your EAC calculation has a significant 
effect on whether this formula is accurate. 
 EAC = AC + (BAC – EV): This formula takes the AC spent to date 
and adds to them the total BAC, subtracting the current EV. 
 EAC = AC + ((BAC – EV)/(CPI × SPI)): This formula takes 
into account both your cost performance and your schedule 
performance and applies them to the value of the work you have 
left to complete.       
 
■ Exam Tip   Memorize all these formulas, and as soon as you are allowed to start the 
exam, write them down. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
226
 
■ Note   Cumulative vs. Non-Cumulative 
 When using either the CPI or SPI formula, you can choose whether to use cumulative or 
non-cumulative variations. The cumulative calculation calculates from the start of the 
project to where you are now in the project; obviously, if you use this, you are assuming 
that particular range is indicative and typical of your cost or schedule performance going 
forward. However, if for some reason you have experienced atypical variances in either time 
or cost on your project in the past, you may want to avoid using these when you use either 
CPI or SPI for forecasts. In this case, you should use non-cumulative CPI or SPI calculations 
taken from a specific period of time you feel is a more accurate representation of likely 
future performance. 
 
REAL WORLD
 When using an EAC formula, as a general rule of thumb, I use the BAC divided by 
CPI calculation for the first third of the project because the information coming out 
at this point tends to be less accurate. After I get past the halfway point on a project, 
I use the AC + ((BAC-EV)/(CPI × SPI)) formula, because it takes into account all 
parameters and is generally more accurate. 
• 
 Estimate to complete (ETC): Your forecast of the remaining costs 
to be incurred on the project. The easiest way to calculate this is 
to subtract AC spent to date from your EAC. The formula is 
 ETC = EAC – AC 
• 
 Variance at completion (VAC): The difference between what you 
originally thought the project was going to cost (BAC) and what 
you now think it will cost (EAC). A negative variance is bad, and a 
positive variance is good. The formula is 
 VAC = BAC –  EAC 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
227
 
■ Exam Tip   There may be occasions when the acronyms used here to outline the EVM 
system are represented by an older set of four-letter acronyms, as follows: 
 Planned value (PV) = Budgeted cost of work scheduled (BCWS) 
 Actual cost (AC) = Actual cost of work performed (ACWP) 
 Earned value (EV) = Budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP) 
 
■ Exam Tip   On the exam, you will often be presented with a scenario that requires you to 
work out one set of figures before you can work out another set of figures. For example, you 
may be required to work out the EAC by using either CPI or SPI but will not be given the CPI 
figures or SPI figures. You will instead be given figures for EC, AC, and PV, and be expected 
to work out either the CPI or the SPI first. Also, when looking at a question that requires you 
to calculate any formula, be on the lookout for irrelevant information, because sometimes 
not all the information presented in the scenario is relevant. 
 To-Complete Performance Index ( TCPI ) 
 The  to-complete performance index (TCPI) tells you the rate at which you have to work to 
achieve either your EAC or your BAC, depending on which one you are targeting. A TCPI 
of less than 1 is good, whereas a TCPI of more than 1 is bad. If you are using the original 
BAC as your target, the formula is
 TCPI
BAC
EV
BAC
AC

 If you are using the EAC as the target, the formula for TCPI is

■ Exam Tip   When doing any calculations on the exam, round your answer to two 
decimals places, but be prepared for an answer that is slightly different due to minor 
differences in the approach to rounding of decimal places. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
228
 Performance Reviews 
 Performance reviews  are conducted via a variety of means, including EVM variances 
and trend analysis. You already have seen the use of EVM variances for the calculation of 
both the cost variance (CV) and schedule variance (SV) using EVM. These are the most 
frequently used methods of determining variance and performance. 
 In addition to EVM variances as a performance review tool, you can use trend 
analysis, which looks at past performance and extrapolates from that a likely future 
performance, usually by using graphs and linear regression.  
 Project Management Software 
 Project management software is very useful in monitoring the performance of cost 
on a project because it can quickly do what would take a lot of time if done manually. 
Additionally, it can take both the original data and any data from calculations and display 
it graphically for easy interpretation and communication.  
 Reserve Analysis 
 Reserve analysis in this monitoring and controlling process is the process of re-examining 
the original reserves calculated—both the contingency and management reserves—and 
checking whether the assumptions made when calculating them are still valid, and also 
releasing any unused portions of contingency reserves from the approved project budget 
in order to enable other projects to access the pool of funds. 
 Outputs 
 The Control Costs process produces the following outputs. 
 Work Performance Information 
 The easiest way to display  work performance information   based on the work 
performance data is by using the earned value calculations for CV, SV, CPI, SPI, and the 
TCPI. The work performance information goes on to be used as an input into the Monitor 
and Control Project Work process. 
 Cost Forecasts 
 Cost forecasts  are obtained from the EAC values. Cost forecasts go on to be used as an 
input into the Monitor and Control Project Work process. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
229
 
REAL WORLD
 It is important to emphasize to project stakeholders that any EAC calculation is just 
that: your estimate about what it will cost to complete the project. When calculating 
the EAC, you are using historical information to try to forecast a likely future 
outcome. If project stakeholders consider your EAC figure an absolute amount that 
you will definitely achieve, this will create unrealistic expectations. 
 Change Requests 
 One of the key outputs from any controlling process is change requests that arise as a 
result of either variances detected or additional information provided. Change requests 
may include preventive or corrective actions. All change requests are processed as per 
your documented and approved change-control process. 
  Change requests go on to be used as an input into the Perform Integrated Change 
Control process from the Integration Management knowledge area. 
 Project Management Plan Updates 
 Specific parts of the project management  plan that may be updated as a result of the 
Control Costs process include the cost baseline and the cost management plan. Project 
management plan updates are used in turn as an input into the Develop Project Plan 
process. 
 Project Document Updates 
 Specific project  documents that may be updated as a result of the Control Costs process 
include any documentation relating to how you build up your cost estimates, such as the 
cost baseline and the basis of estimates document. 
 Organizational Process Asset Updates 
 Specific organizational process  assets that may be updated as a result of the Control Cost 
process are historical information, records of financial information kept, lessons learned, 
records of corrective actions, and updates to any organizational financial templates and 
policies in order to ensure that they are still relevant.

 Quick Check 
 
 1. 
 What is the difference between work performance data and 
work performance information? 
 
 2. 
 If a project has a CPI of 1.1 and an SPI of .90, how is it 
performing in relation to time and cost? 
 
 3. 
 What is the key difference between each of the four formulas 
for estimate at completion? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 Work performance data is the raw information collected by 
checking on cost and time performance. Work performance 
information applies filters to this data to make it useful 
information. 
 
 2. 
 This project is under budget because the CPI is greater than 1, 
but behind schedule because the SPI is less than 1. 
 
 3. 
 Each of the four formulas uses different historical information 
about the project to forecast a likely future outcome. 
 Chapter Summary 
• 
 The Cost Management knowledge area is focused on the 
development and checking of project costs and begins with a 
planning process that produces the cost management plan, 
which then guides the individual cost estimating process and 
development of the cost baseline. It also provides guidance 
on monitoring actual versus planned cost performance and 
managing any changes to the cost baseline. 
• 
 The Plan Cost Management process focuses on the production 
of the cost management plan, which is a subsidiary plan of the 
project management plan. 
• 
 The Estimate Costs process is a highly iterative process repeated 
throughout the project that uses a variety of estimating 
techniques to developed individual activity cost estimates. 
• 
 The Determine Budget process aggregates the individual activity 
cost estimates and determines exactly when the costs will be 
incurred to produce a time-phased project budget, or cost 
baseline. 
• 
 The Control Costs process assesses planned cost performance 
against actual cost performance and forecasts a likely future state 
by using the earned value management systems. Any changes to 
the project cost baseline or individual activity cost estimates are 
managed through the approved change-control process.

 Answers 
 This section contains the answers to the questions for the Exercises and Review 
Questions in this chapter. 
 Exercises 
 
 1. 
 You are the project manager on a project to build ten identical 
offices. You expect to spend $50,000 per office to complete the 
work and take 20 months to finish. You are 12 months into the 
work and have completed five offices and spent $310,000 in 
total. Use this information to calculate the following:
 i. 
 Budget at completion (BAC): 10 offices × $50,000 each = 
$500,000 
 ii. 
 Actual cost (AC): You have spent $310,000 in total, so this 
is your actual cost. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
235
  iii. 
 Planned value (PV): You are 12 months into a 20-month 
work program, so you planned to have created value 
equivalent to 12/20, or 60%, of your total planned value, 
or budget at completion. Therefore, your planned value 
(PV) is $500,000 × 60% = $300,000. 
  iv. 
 Earned value (EV): You have built five offices, each 
with a value to you of $50,000, so your earned value is 
5 × $50,000 = $250,000.  
 v. 
  Cost variance (CV): CV = EV – AC: $250,000 – $310,000 = 
–$60,000.  
 vi. 
 Cost performance index (CPI): CPI = EV/AC: 
$250,000/$310,000 = 0.81.  
 vii. 
 Schedule variance (SV): SV = EV – PV: $250,000 – 
$300,000 = –$50,000.  
 viii. 
 Schedule performance index (SPI): SPI = EV/PV: 
$250,000/$300,000 = 0.83.  
 ix. 
 Estimate at completion (EAC)
 a. 
 EAC= BAC/CPI: $500,000/0.81 = $617,283.95 
  b. 
 EAC = AC + ETC: $310,000 + $307,283.95 = 
$617,283.95  
  c. 
 EAC = AC + (BAC – EV): $310,000 + ($500,000 – 
$250,000) = $560,000  
  d. 
 EAC = AC + ((BAC–EV)/(CPI × SPI)): $310,000 + 
(($500,000 – $250,000)/(0.81 × 0.83)) = $681,857.80  
 x. 
 Estimate to complete (ETC): This answer depends on 
which EAC figure you choose to use in the formula ETC = 
EAC – AC. If you use the EAC from the BAC/CPI formula, 
the answer is $307,283.95. 
 xi. 
  Variance at completion (VAC): This answer depends on 
which EAC you choose to use in the formula VAC = BAC 
– EAC. If you use the EAC from the BAC/CPI formula, the 
answer is –$117,283.95. 
 xii. 
 To-complete performance index (TCPI): This answer 
depends on whether your target is your BAC or the EAC. 
If it is the EAC, the answer depends on which formula 
you use to calculate that. The following example uses 
BAC/CPI to calculate EAC:
 a. 
 TCPI for EAC = (BAC – EV)/(EAC – AC) = 0.81 
 b. 
 TCPI for BAC = (BAC – EV)/(BAC – AC) = 1.31 

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
236
 (b) Based on the information gained from the calculations you have performed, how 
is the project performing in terms of both cost and time? 
 Based on the information calculated, the project is over budget because the cost 
variance (CV) is negative and the cost performance index (CPI) is less than 1. The project 
is behind schedule, because the schedule variance (SV) is negative and the schedule 
performance index (SPI) is less than 1. 
 
 2. 
 You are the project manager on a project to complete 15 miles 
of road. Your approved budget for the project is $930,000, 
and you have forecast that the project will take 35 weeks 
to complete. You are 13 weeks into the project and have 
constructed seven miles of road at a cost of $58,000 per mile. 
Use this information to calculate the following:
 i. 
 Budget at completion (BAC): $930,000 
 ii. 
 Actual cost (AC): You have built seven miles of road at a 
cost of $58,000, so your AC is 7 × $58,000 = $406,000.  
 iii. 
 Planned value (PV): You are 13 weeks into a 35-week work 
program, so you planned to have created value of 13/35, or 
37%, of your total planned value, or budget at completion. 
Therefore, your PV is $930,000 × 37% = $344,100.  
 iv. 
 Earned value (EV): You are building 15 miles of road for 
$930,000, so each mile of road has a value of $930,000/15 = 
$62,000. You have built seven miles of road each with a 
value to you of $62,000, so your earned value is 7 × $62,000 = 
$434,000.  
  v. 
 Cost variance (CV): CV = EV – AC: $434,000 – $406,000 = 
$28,000. 
 vi. 
 Cost performance index (CPI): CPI = EV/AC: 
$434,000/$406,000 = 1.07.  
 vii. 
 Schedule variance (SV): SV = EV – PV: $434,000 – 
$344,100 = $89,900.  
 viii. 
 Schedule performance index (SPI): SPI = EV/PV: 
$434,000/$344,100 = 1.26.  
 ix. 
 Estimate at completion (EAC)
 a. 
 EAC= BAC/CPI: $930,000 / 1.07 = $869,158.88 
 b. 
 EAC = AC + ETC: $406,000 + $464, 158.88 = 
$870,158.88  
 c. 
 EAC = AC + (BAC – EV): $406,000 + ($930,000 – 
$434,000) = $902,000  
 d. 
 EAC = AC + ((BAC – EV)/(CPI × SPI)): $406,000 + 
(($930,000 – $434,000)/(1.07 × 1.26)) = $773,407.41  

CHAPTER 5 ■ COST MANAGEMENT
237
 x. 
 Estimate to complete (ETC): This answer depends on 
which EAC figure you choose to use in the formula ETC = 
EAC – AC. If you use the EAC from the BAC/CPI formula, 
the answer is $463,158.88. 
 xi. 
 Variance at completion (VAC): This answer depends on 
which EAC you choose to use in the formula VAC = BAC 
– EAC. If you use the EAC from the BAC/CPI formula, the 
answer is $60,841.12. 
 xii. 
 To-complete performance index (TCPI): This answer 
depends on whether your target is your BAC or the EAC. 
If it is the EAC, the answer depends on which formula 
you use to calculate that. The following example uses 
BAC/CPI to calculate EAC:
 a. 
 TCPI for EAC = (BAC – EV)/(EAC – AC) = 1.07 
 b. 
 TCPI for BAC = (BAC – EV)/(BAC – AC) = 0.95 
 (b) Based on the information gained from the calculations you have performed, how 
is the project performing in terms of both cost and time? 
 Based on the information from the earned value calculations, the project is ahead of 
schedule because the schedule variance (SV) is positive and the schedule performance 
index (SPI) is greater than 1. The project is also under budget, because the cost variance 
(CV) is positive and the cost performance index (CPI) is greater than 1.

 CHAPTER 6  
 Quality Management 
 This chapter focuses on the topic of project quality management. Project Quality 
Management, like the other knowledge areas, begins with a process of planning that 
produces a quality management plan. It then has an executing process, Perform Quality 
Assurance, which is focused on defining and checking the quality of the processes in 
the project. It also has a monitoring and controlling process, Control Quality, which is 
focused on defining and inspecting the quality of the project deliverables. 
 You may need to pay particular attention in this chapter to those activities and 
the range of different quality tools that are described, because many of them may be 
new to you. 
 The PMBOK  ®   Guide Processes 
 Project Quality Management Knowledge Area 
 The three  processes in the Project Quality Management knowledge area are as 
follows:
• 
 Plan Quality Management (planning process) 
• 
 Perform Quality Assurance (executing process)  
• 
 Control Quality (monitoring and controlling process) 
 What Is Project Quality Management? 
 Project Quality Management is  focused on the processes of developing a quality 
management plan, defining and checking particular processes that affect the entire 
project, and inspecting the quality of project deliverables. The general process of quality 
management in the PMBOK Guide is aligned to the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) guide to quality management. Therefore, if you have experience 
with the standards, you will find this section easier to understand. 
 Let’s start with the formal definition of what  quality is. It is defined as the degree 
to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfills requirements. You should remember 
this definition because it may be different from how you define quality. It has two key 
elements: the first is a defined set of observed characteristics, which are then measured 
against the second element, a predefined set of requirements. The closer these two 
elements are, the higher the level of quality. As a result of defining the characteristics of 
quality and the requirements that will be met, you are seeking to satisfy customer and 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
242
stakeholder expectations. The responsibility for establishing a professional approach to 
quality management in an organization, and in a project, lies with management. 
 In addition to the exact definition of quality, there are some basic foundational 
concepts of quality management that you must be aware of. 
 A key foundational concept of the approach to quality management is that, generally 
speaking, it costs less to prevent a mistake than it does to correct a mistake. This concept 
of prevention over inspection informs much of the approach to quality management. You 
should always assume that you have the ability to prevent mistakes rather than spend 
time and money correcting them once they are discovered. In addition to costing time 
and money to fix mistakes, poor quality may result in the client not accepting the product, 
and therefore it can also adversely affect your reputation. 
 You need to be aware that quality management is not something that happens 
only once; it is ongoing throughout the life of the project, and it is iterative. Not only is 
quality management highly iterative, like other project management processes, but one 
of its central elements is the concept of  continuous improvement , or  kaizen . Continuous 
improvement is an iterative process of always seeking to improve your approach to, and 
results obtained from, quality management processes, and it has the goal of improving 
the quality of the project processes as well as the project deliverables. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Kaizen is a loose Japanese translation of the term  continuous improvement . 
So on the exam, if you find either term, you will know what it means. 
 Precision and  accuracy are two separate terms; you need to be aware of the definition 
of each. Precision relates to how tightly clustered results are. The closer the results are, 
the more precise the measurements being taken are. Accuracy, on the other hand, refers 
to how close the results are to the actual value. An example to illustrate the concepts is a 
shooting target and ten shots taken at the target. Accuracy refers to how close the shots 
are to the bullseye, which is the intended target. Precision refers to how tightly grouped 
the ten shots are, no matter how close to the bullseye they are. If they are tightly grouped, 
then they demonstrate a high level of precision. Obviously, the preferred mix is high 
degrees of both accuracy and precision. 
 In your workplace, you may use the two terms  quality and  grade interchangeably. 
However, for the purposes of the exam, it is important to realize they are distinct 
concepts. Quality is defined as the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfills 
requirements. Grade, on the other hand, refers to the number of features a particular 
product has. For example, some manufacturers produce different brands to indicate the 
difference between low-grade and high-grade products. The products themselves are 
manufactured to the same quality standards, but some have fewer features, or are of a 
lower grade, than others. 
 Most people know  just in time (JIT) as an inventory-control system in which 
suppliers provide materials just before they are required. It is often seen as an efficient 
way to manage organizational finances, because it does not require funds to be tied up in 
stock or materials being stored. However, JIT can also be used as a quality management 
approach; the absence of materials in stock forces an organization to maintain a high 
level of quality because it cannot depend on simply going to its warehouse for more stock 
when poor quality is produced. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
243
 Total quality management (TQM) is a particular approach to quality management 
that means everybody in an organization takes responsibility for quality within the 
organization or project. It is led by management, and everyone at all levels of the 
organization is expected, encouraged, and trained to participate in constantly improving 
all aspects of quality. 
 Six Sigma is a proprietary approach to quality management that offers credentials 
such as green belt and black belt. Six Sigma practitioners are focused on reducing quality 
defects to as close to zero as possible. 
 
REAL WORLD
 When I was working in the telecommunications industry, we had to build telephone 
networks reliable enough that when someone dialed the emergency number for 
police, ambulance, or fire, it would connect 99,999 times out of every 100,000 
attempts. This was known as  five nines reliability; that is, 99.999% of the time, it 
had to work. This is an example of a Six Sigma approach. 
 
■ Note   Deming, Juran, and quality management 
 Much of the modern history of the profession of quality management is rooted in the 
seminal works of William Edwards Deming. Deming, through his approach to quality 
management, contributed greatly to the rise of the post–World War II Japanese economy 
based on competing on quality. Deming is also known for his collaboration with Walter 
Shewhart in producing and refining the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, which forms the basis 
not only of quality management but also of the profession of project management. At the 
same time that Deming was influencing Japanese industry, Joseph Juran was working in 
the same area; he is best known for his approach to quality as a management activity, the 
Pareto analysis, and the cost of quality analysis. If you want to know more about quality 
management, I highly recommend reading the work of these researchers. 
 Plan Quality Management 
 
■ More Info   Plan Quality Management 
 You can read more about the Plan Quality Management process in the PMBOK Guide, 
5th edition, in Chapter   8 , section 8.1. Table  6-1 identifies the process inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
244
 The Plan Quality Management process is a  planning process with a range of 
outputs including, most important, the  quality management plan . Similar to the other 
planning documents, the quality management plan will guide your efforts in defining 
and controlling the quality of both the project processes and the deliverables. It forms 
a subsidiary plan to the overall project management plan. Another important output 
from the Plan Quality Management process is the process improvement plan, which is 
also a subsidiary of the project management plan and details how you will define and 
continuously improve all the processes on your project. 
 The Plan Quality Management process covers the following planning  domain task  :
• 
 Task 8: Develop the quality management plan and define the 
quality standards for the project and its products, based on 
the project scope, risks, and requirements, in order to prevent the 
occurrence of defects and control the cost of quality. 
 Inputs 
 The Plan Quality Management process uses some or all of the following inputs as part of 
the development of the quality management plan for the project. 
 Project Management Plan 
 The distinct elements of the  project management plan that are useful in developing your 
own quality management plan are the scope, schedule, and cost baselines, because they 
contain information against which to measure quality. The project management plan is 
an output from the Develop Project Management Plan process.

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
245
 Stakeholder Register 
 Given that the purpose of quality management is to deliver processes and products that 
meet customer and stakeholder expectations, the  stakeholder register —which describes 
stakeholders, their interest in the project, the impact they have on the project, and 
their expectations in relation to the project generally and quality specifically—can be 
considered a very important input into the Plan Quality Management process. 
 The stakeholder register is an output from the Identify Stakeholders process in the 
Stakeholder Management knowledge area. 
 Risk Register 
 The  risk register  documents and assesses specific risks that may have an impact on any 
quality management issues and decisions you are making. The risk register is an output 
from the Identify Risks process in the Risk Management knowledge area. 
 Requirements Documentation 
 Given that the definition of quality is the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics 
fulfills requirements, it is important to use the  requirements documentation as an input 
because it describes and documents the requirements. Requirements documentation is an 
output from the Collect Requirements process in the Scope Management knowledge area.  
 Enterprise Environmental Factors 
 Particular  enterprise environmental factors that may assist with the development of your 
quality management plan include any external local or central government regulations 
pertaining to quality specifications, and any other industry rules or guidelines. 
 
REAL WORLD
 One of the key enterprise environmental factors affecting the quality management 
plans that I have worked on are external standards that different products and 
deliverables must meet. These are often set by industry organizations or government 
departments and may change during the duration of your project. Local governments 
may set building or manufacturing quality standards or health and safety standards, 
or industry or professional bodies may set employment standards. There are many 
examples of external enterprise environmental factors relating to quality. If you are 
getting accredited as an ISO 9001–compliant organization or obtaining the PMP 
credential because it is a government or industry requirement for you to work as a 
project manager, this is an example of an enterprise environmental factor at work.

 Organizational Process Assets 
 Organizational process assets that may be important inputs into the development of your 
quality management plan include relevant organizational policies and guidelines relating 
to the organization’s approach and expectations of quality, and any historical information 
or lessons learned from previous projects relating to quality. 
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques are available to be used to develop the inputs into this 
process in order to produce the quality management plan. 
 Cost-Benefit Analysis 
 Cost-benefit analysis is used as a tool in the Plan Quality Management process because 
you need to look at the costs of meeting quality requirements, which generally increase as 
you seek to improve quality and avoid re-work and decreasing stakeholder satisfaction. 
The pursuit of quality is always a trade-off between the costs involved and the benefits 
obtained; therefore, using cost-benefit analysis is an important tool for producing a 
quality management plan. 
 Cost of Quality 
 Cost of quality considers the total cost of quality over the life of the product, which is well 
beyond the life of the project and examines the cost of low quality, subsequent warranty 
claims, any negative effect on brand or reputation, and loss of future work. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Cost of quality is mirrored by, and sometimes referred to as,  cost of poor 
quality . Whatever the term used, it is the concept of assessing what the implications are for 
producing or not producing quality products far beyond the life of the project. 
 Seven Basic Quality Tools 
 The catchall phrase  seven basic quality tools refers to the graphical representation of tools 
used to measure, assess, and determine causes of quality issues. They are a convenient 
and graphical way to represent what can often be quite complex text-based or numerical 
information to allow quick communication and assessment of quality issues. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Each of the seven basic quality tools refers to a particular type of diagram. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
247
 The  cause-and-effect diagram , which is also called the  Ishikawa or  fishbone  diagram , 
is used to describe a known defect and assess the variety of possible causes. It enables 
you to consider multiple causes for a single problem. Figure  6-1  shows a  cause-and-effect 
diagram with one level of analysis done. You start by identifying a particular defect and 
then look at all the possible causes of that defect; if you want to, you can also seek further 
root causes of each identified cause. After you have identified the potential causes, you 
can then use more quantifiable analysis, such as counting the number of times that cause 
is responsible for the defect, and come up with a prioritized list of causes.  
 
■ Exam Tip   This is one of those instances where multiple terms mean the same thing on 
the exam. This diagram may be referred to as the  cause-and-effect ,  Ishikawa , or  fishbone 
diagram . 
 Figure 6-1.  A cause-and-effect, Ishikawa,  or fishbone diagram 
 Flowcharts  are a convenient way to show the flow of information, or the sequence of 
steps, in a particular process. Figure  6-2 shows an example of a flowchart. 
 Figure 6-2.  Flowchart 
 
REAL WORLD
 Each shape used in a flow chart has a specific meaning attached to it. For example, 
the rectangle shape indicates a process, and the diamond shape indicates a 
decision point. Every shape used has a different meaning so that you can look at the 
flowchart and get information quickly. 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
248
 
■ Exam Tip   On the exam, you may see the acronym SIPOC used. If so, it is referring 
to a particular type of flowchart used for documenting the flow of goods and information 
between and customers. The acronym SIPOC stands for Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs. 
and Customers. 
 Checksheets are a convenient way to document quality problems or issues and their 
frequency of occurrence. Checksheets are sometimes called  tally sheets . Figure  6-3 shows 
an example of a checksheet. 
 Figure 6-3.  Checksheet 
 Checksheets can provide a simple but useful way of capturing events and trends as 
they occur. Looking at the example in Figure  6-3 , it could be determined that the majority 
of the team’s health and safety breaches occur after a weekend. If this is deemed to be 
true, the project manager could put measures in place to ensure that health and safety 
matters are on the forefront on the team’s mind after each weekend. 
 
■ Exam Tip   The difference between a checksheet and a checklist is that a checksheet 
provides a way to capture the occurrences of an event, whereas a checklist documents 
what steps need to be completed to carry out a certain process. Checksheets are a tool in 
the Plan Quality Management process. Quality checklists are an output from Plan Quality 
Management and are used as an input into Control Quality. 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
249
 A  Pareto diagram is a way of using a histogram to document the frequency of 
particular events in descending order and then add up the cumulative percentage of the 
quality defects in order to assess which subset of defects causes the greatest number of 
problems. The purpose of this Pareto analysis is to focus your attention and energy on 
those 20% of problems that are causing 80% of the issues. Figure  6-4 shows an example of 
a Pareto diagram.  
 Figure 6-4.  Pareto diagram 
 
■ Note   Pareto principle 
 Joseph Juran first used the term  Pareto principle to refer to what is now more commonly 
referred to as the  80:20 rule . It was called the Pareto principle because in the early part of 
the 20th century, an economist by the name of Wilfried (or Vilfredo, if you are Italian) Pareto 
observed that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the people. This 80:20 rule 
has come to be used in a wide variety of disciplines to describe any situation where a small 
amount of a population is responsible for many of the observations made. 
 Histograms , or bar charts, are a simple way of representing frequency, or occurrence, 
of particular events. Figure  6-5 shows an example of a histogram. 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
250
 Control charts are an effective way of recording data and determining whether a 
manufacturing process is still in control or is about to go out of control. Information is 
gathered and plotted on the control chart around an expected average, or mean. Using 
standard deviations, you can then set the upper and lower control limits, three standard 
deviations either side of the mean. Beyond these  control limits , the upper and lower 
 specification limit  is set. Any data point that appears outside of the specification limit 
will not be accepted by the customer. Any data point that appears outside of the control 
limit but within a specification limit indicates that the process is out of control and 
investigation should commence immediately as to the cause. Any information or data 
gathered in the control limits is acceptable. 
 The exception to this rule is when seven consecutive data points appear either side 
of the mean. This is called the  rule of seven : it is statistically improbable that you will get 
seven consecutive points on either side of the mean. An easy way to understand the rule 
of seven is to consider a coin being tossed and the chances of it landing with either heads 
or tails facing up. You would expect a random distribution of heads and tails but would 
consider it statistically improbable that you would get seven consecutive heads or tails. 
If you do note seven consecutive data points above or below the mean, it signals that 
you should investigate the cause, because the process may be about to go out of control. 
Figure  6-6 shows an example of a control chart. Note the appearance of seven consecutive 
data points above the mean, indicating the rule of seven.

 Scatter diagrams simply record the relationship between two variables in graphical 
form. Figure  6-7  shows an example of a scatter diagram . 
 Figure 6-6.  Control chart 
 Figure 6-7.  Scatter diagram 
 
■ Note   Ishikawa and quality management 
 The development of the seven basic quality tools is attributed to the work of Kaoru Ishikawa, 
a Japanese professor and one of the great quality management advocates and developers. 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
252
 Benchmarking 
 Benchmarking is the process of comparing your quality practices to those of other 
projects or other organizations and seeing how you compare. 
 Design of Experiments 
 Design of experiments is a tool to assist with developing useful and reliable experiments 
to test quality. Key considerations in the design of experiments include the identification 
and control of variables and the understanding of how the testing process itself may affect 
observed outcomes. A well-designed experiment can independently control different 
variables to determine which ones are causing problems.  
 Statistical Sampling 
 Statistical sampling is used when there are either too many quality checks to do or quality 
checks involve destructive testing. For example, you may want to do testing on lines of 
software code being written, but there are more than 100,000 lines of code. Instead of 
checking every line of code, you can select 100 lines of code and check them for accuracy. 
One constraint of statistical sampling is the assumption that the result from a small 
population is representative of the entire population. 
 Additional Quality Planning Tools 
 Along with the tools and techniques listed previously,  additional quality planning tools 
can be used to plan your particular approach to quality management. These include 
brainstorming and nominal group techniques, both of which you have seen as tools 
and techniques and other areas. In addition to these two tools, you can use force field 
analysis, affinity diagrams, process decision program charts, interrelationship diagrams, 
tree diagrams, prioritization matrices, activity network diagrams, and matrix diagrams. 
All of these quality management and control tools are covered in more depth in the 
Perform Quality Assurance process. 
 Another  quality planning tool that can be used is  failure mode and effect analysis 
(FMEA) .  FMEA is a widely used technique that examines the consequence of failure in 
any part of the system and uses those observations to ensure that failure does not actually 
occur or that, if it does, the impact is anticipated and mitigated. In this process, you could 
use this tool to determine the likely effect of failure of the product and prepare to ensure 
that it doesn’t happen. 
 Meetings 
 Meetings  are a useful way to bring together members of the project team and 
other stakeholders so that they can contribute to the development of the quality 
management plan.  

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
253
 Outputs 
 After applying the appropriate tools and techniques to the selected inputs, the Plan 
Quality Management process has the following outputs. 
 Quality Management Plan 
 The  Plan Quality Management process has the  quality management plan as its primary 
output. Similar to other management plans, the quality management plan provides a 
description of the overall approach to quality management, guidelines for all project 
processes and how they will be implemented, and a description of expected quality, 
testing, and inspection of project deliverables. The detail contained in the quality 
management plan reflects the size and complexity of the project, and the plan should be 
updated and reviewed regularly to ensure that it is still accurate. The quality management 
plan is then a key input into the Perform Quality Assurance and Control Quality processes.  
 
■ Exam Tip   According to the PMBOK Guide, every project should have a quality 
management plan. The quality management plan can be formal and documented, or it can 
be an informal set of policies and guidelines. It reflects the size and complexity of the project 
but should always be done. 
 
REAL WORLD
 Many organizations, after they reach a certain size, appoint a particular person 
to manage quality in the organization and also within projects. I believe this is an 
important step for an organization to take, because a focus on quality is often a 
much more important element than a focus on cost. A simple way to remember why 
quality is so important to your project is that if you don’t care about quality, your 
competitor will. I remember on one large project I was managing that I wanted the 
quality of the project to be the legacy that I left rather than coming in under budget 
and ahead of time. We still focused on measuring cost and time performance, and 
we did come in under budget and ahead of time, but the element I was proudest of 
was the extra quality we were able to deliver. 
 Process Improvement Plan 
 The  process improvement plan is a subsidiary of the project management plan that 
focuses specifically on analyzing quality processes and describing ways in which 
continuous improvement can be applied to these processes. The process improvement 
plan is used as an input into the Perform Quality Assurance process. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
254
 
■ Exam Tip   Note that the process improvement plan is not used as an input into the 
Control Quality process because its primary focus is on project processes, which are the 
main focus of the Perform Quality Assurance process. 
 Quality Metrics 
 The development and documentation of specific  quality metrics    is necessary in order to 
be able to measure progress against what has been planned. The more specific the quality 
metric, the more detailed the measurement and reporting can be. The most common 
quality metrics developed include performance measurements relating to schedule, cost, 
defects, failure, and reliability. The quality metrics are used as an input into the Perform 
Quality Assurance and the Control Quality processes. 
 Quality Checklists 
 The  quality checklist is a specific type of checklist you can use to determine whether 
defined steps of the quality process have been performed. A quality checklist should both 
document the steps to be taken and incorporate acceptance criteria from the project 
requirements and scope baseline. The quality checklists are used as an input into the 
Control Quality process. 
 Project Document Updates 
 The specific project  documents that may be updated as a result of completing the 
Plan Quality Management process are the stakeholder register and the responsibility 
assignment matrix. 
 Quick Check 
 
 1. 
 What is the key function of a quality management plan? 
 
 2. 
 What does it mean when a data point is outside the control 
limit but within the specification limit? 
 
 3. 
 Under what circumstances would you use statistical 
sampling? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 The key function of a quality management plan is to describe 
your particular approach to quality in your project, the 
relevant policies, your approach to quality assurance and 
process improvement, quality metrics, and how you will 
control and measure quality of the project deliverables.  

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
255
 
 2. 
  If a data point is outside the control limit but within the 
specification limit, this indicates that the process may be out 
of control and requires immediate investigation. 
 
 3. 
 You would use statistical sampling to determine the level 
of quality when there are too many samples to investigate 
individually or when investigating the quality of the sample 
involves destructive testing. 
 Perform Quality Assurance 
 
■ More Info   Perform Quality Assurance 
 You can read more about the Perform Quality Assurance process in the PMBOK Guide, 
5th edition, in Chapter   8 , section 8.2. Table  6-2 identifies the process inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs.

 The Perform Quality Assurance  process is an executing process that uses the quality 
management plan for guidance and is focused on implementing processes across the 
entire project and checking that these processes are being adhered to and continuously 
improved. The processes that you define and audit won’t only be processes around 
quality management. For example, you could decide to have a process about setting 
up and choosing the right projects, culminating in a signed project charter, all of which 
would be covered in the Develop Project Charter process. The Perform Quality Assurance 
process checks that you have followed this process correctly. 
 The Perform Quality Assurance process covers the following executing  domain task  :
• 
 Task 3: Implement the quality management plan using the 
appropriate tools and techniques, in order to ensure that work is 
performed in accordance with required quality standards. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
256
 
■ Exam Tip   A simple way to remember the difference between quality assurance and 
quality control is that quality assurance uses audits and focuses on processes, whereas 
quality control focuses on inspections and the project deliverables. 
 
REAL WORLD
 The ISO 9000 standard is an excellent example of quality assurance at work. This 
standard requires processes to be in place and regular audits to occur to ensure 
that the processes are being followed. The standard does not focus on the quality 
of the product being produced. Thus, some unscrupulous companies have ISO 9000 
accreditation but produce low-quality products. 
 Inputs 
 The Perform Quality Assurance process uses some or all of the following inputs. 
 Quality Management Plan 
 The  quality management plan is obviously a key input into the Perform Quality Assurance 
process because it guides how the process is carried out. The quality management plan is 
an output from the Plan Quality Management process. 
 Process Improvement Plan 
 The  process improvement plan is used as an input into this process because it is focused 
on detailing the processes that will be put in place and how they will be checked 
and improved. The process improvement plan is an output from the Plan Quality 
Management process. 
 Quality Metrics 
 The  quality metrics are specific variables that can be measured as part of checking 
whether you are implementing and adhering to particular quality processes. The quality 
metrics are an output from the Plan Quality Management process. 
 Quality Control Measurements 
 Quality control measurements are generated by the Control Quality process and are used 
in the Perform Quality Assurance process to analyze and evaluate the particular quality 
standards relating to the quality processes that are supposed to have been followed. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
257
 Project Documents 
 The specific types of  project documents that are useful as inputs into the Perform Quality 
Assurance process are any documents relating to requirements or quality processes, or 
those that define stakeholder expectations. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Did you notice that neither environmental enterprise factors nor 
organizational process assets are used as inputs into this process?  
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques are used on the inputs to deliver the Perform Quality 
Assurance process outputs. 
 Quality Management and Control Tools 
 The Perform Quality Assurance process uses all the tools and techniques featured 
throughout the Quality Management knowledge area. It uses the seven basic tools of 
quality already covered in the Plan Quality Management process, as well as statistical 
sampling, inspection, benchmarking, design of experiments, cost-benefit analysis, and 
cost of quality. 
 Additionally, you can use the following  seven new quality tools and techniques. 
Each of these quality management and control tools is used to document and represent 
particular measurements taken during the Perform Quality Assurance process. 
 
■ Note   Seven new quality tools 
 The seven new quality tools come from the book  Seven New QC Tools: Practical Applications 
for Managers by Yoshinobu Nayatani, Toru Eiga, Ryoji Futami, and Hiroyuki Miyagawa 
(Productivity Press, 1994). These seven tools and the basic seven tools all represent data in 
graphical format for easy interpretation and communication.  
 Affinity diagrams , or KJ Methods diagrams, can be used during a brainstorming 
session to create cause-and-effect diagrams because they group data in logical 
relationships. Figure   6-8  shows an example of an affinity diagram . 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
258
 A  process decision program chart ( PDPC ) displays in graphical and hierarchical form 
the steps in a process in order to understand issues that may positively or negatively affect 
the sequence of activities to reach a goal. In this sense, it is a cross between a flowchart 
and a breakdown structure. Figure  6-9 shows an example of a PDPC. 
 Figure 6-8.  Affinity diagram 
 Figure 6-9.  Process decision program chart 
 Interrelationship digraphs are useful  to  graphically show multiple cause-and-
effect relationships among various factors. Figure  6-10 shows an example of an 
interrelationship digraph. 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
259
 A  tree diagram is a very useful graphical representation of hierarchical relationships 
and parent-to-child relationships. You have seen the tree diagram as a work, risk, and 
organizational breakdown structure. In managing quality, the tree diagram can be used to 
describe nested relationships between steps in the quality assurance process. Figure  6-11 
shows an example of a tree diagram. 
 Figure 6-10.  Interrelationship digraph 
 Figure 6-11.  Tree diagram 
 Prioritization matrices use a variety of weighted criteria to determine the priority of 
quality actions to enable the key issues to be determined. Figure  6-12 shows an example 
of a prioritization matrix. 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
260
 Activity network diagrams are used to show relationships between activities 
to be completed. You have already seen these diagrams used in the managing the 
project schedule and determining the tasks on the critical path with  activity-on-node 
(AON) diagrams . In quality management, they are used to show the sequence of, and 
interrelationships between, various quality activities. Figure  6-13 shows an example of an 
activity network diagram. 
 Figure 6-12.  Prioritization matrix 
 Figure 6-13.  Activity network  diagram 
 Matrix diagrams are used to indicate whether a relationship exists between two 
variables. Figure  6-14  shows an example of a matrix diagram.   
  Figure 6-14.  Matrix diagram 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
261
 Quality Audits 
 A  quality audit is an independent process that seeks to determine whether the defined 
project processes are being carried out as per the quality management plan. Quality 
audits are carried out using the quality management plan as a guideline and should 
generally be done by people not involved with the project who can independently assess 
whether the required processes are in place and whether they are being followed. 
 
REAL WORLD
 On one particularly large project I was managing, we had it as part of the contract 
that regular audits would occur on all our project processes. We had an independent 
assessor appointed from one of the large global auditing companies, and every six 
months, that assessor would show up in person and spend several days requesting 
proof that we had processes in place and that we followed those processes 
correctly. The assessor would then produce a report detailing areas of both 
compliance and noncompliance. As the project manager, it was my responsibility 
to ensure that any areas of noncompliance were addressed promptly. The costs for 
completing these quality audits were part of the overall project budget. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Wherever you find an audit being used as a tool, it will be checking that 
processes are in place, that they are being followed as per the requirements, and that any 
deviation from the processes is documented and dealt with. Audits do not check the quality 
of any deliverables or products. 
 Process Analysis 
 Process analysis  takes the steps in the process improvement plan and executes them in 
order to identify and improve existing processes. 
 Outputs 
 The Perform Quality Assurance process produces some or all of the following outputs. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
262
 Change Requests 
 Change requests are generated as a result of information discovered by audits and 
process analysis that then requires changes to be considered as per the agreed change 
management process. The change requests are used as an input into the Perform 
Integrated Change Control process. 
 Project Management Plan Updates 
 The specific parts of the project management  plan that may be updated as a result of 
the Perform Quality Assurance process are the quality management plan, the process 
improvement plan, the schedule management plan, and the cost management plan. 
 Project Document Updates 
 The specific project  documents that may be updated as a result of the Perform Quality 
Assurance process include such things as project-specific policies and guidelines relating 
to preparation and execution of processes. 
 Organizational Process Asset Updates 
 The specific organizational process  assets that may be updated as a result of the Perform 
Quality Assurance process are any templates, policies, or guidelines relating to quality 
audits, and training and appointment of independent auditors. 
 Quick Check 
 
 1. 
 What is the difference between quality assurance and quality 
control? 
 
 2. 
 What is it that both the seven basic quality tools and the seven 
new quality tools are attempting to do? 
 
 3. 
 What is the purpose of a quality audit? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 The difference between quality assurance and quality control 
is that quality assurance is focused on the processes of the 
project, whereas quality control is focused on the project 
deliverables. 
 
 2. 
 All of the quality tools described seek to take what can be 
quite complex text, verbal, or numerical information and 
collate and present it in an easy-to-understand graphical 
form. 
 
 3. 
 The purpose of the quality audit is to independently check 
that required processes are in place and are being followed.

 Control Quality 
 
■ More Info   Control Quality 
 You can read more about the Control Quality process in the PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, in Chapter   8 ,

 The Control Quality process is a monitoring and controlling process that uses 
the quality management plan and checks that the project deliverables will meet the 
documented requirements and stakeholder expectations. 
 The Control Quality process covers the following  monitoring and controlling 
domain task :
• 
 Task 3: Verify that project deliverables conform to the quality 
standards established in the quality management plan by using 
appropriate tools and techniques, in order to meet project 
requirements and business needs.  
 Inputs 
 The following inputs are used in the Control Quality process. 
 Quality Management Plan 
 The  quality management plan is a critical input into the Control Quality process because 
it sets out and describes how this process will occur. The quality management plan is an 
output from the Plan Quality Management process 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
264
 Quality Metrics 
 The  quality metrics are a required input into the Control Quality process because 
they describe the attributes that are expected in the project deliverables and how 
these attributes will be measured. Quality metrics are an output from the Plan Quality 
Management process 
 Quality Checklists 
 Quality checklists  provide a documented and structured list of steps, attributes, and 
guidelines that can be used to ensure that all the quality control work is done correctly. 
Quality checklists are an output from the Plan Quality Management process. 
 Work Performance Data 
 In order  to  measure whether the project is being delivered as per the desired quality 
requirements, you need  work performance data. Work performance data is an output 
from the Direct and Manage Project Work process. 
 Approved Change Requests 
 Approved change requests can have an impact on the project deliverables and may 
require modifications, such as defect repairs, and thus are an important input into this 
process. Approved change requests are an output from the Perform Integrated Change 
Control process. 
 Deliverables 
 Given that the control quality process is focused on checking the quality of the 
deliverables, having the  deliverables as an input into the process can be viewed as quite 
critical. 
 Project Documents 
 The specific types of  project documents that may be used as inputs into this process 
include any contracts that specify deliverable requirements and attributes, and any 
relevant quality audit reports. 
 Organizational Process Assets 
 The specific  organizational process assets that can assist with the Control Quality process 
are any guidelines, processes, policies, or blank templates that the organization has 
relating to quality control. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
265
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques for this process can be used on the separate inputs to 
deliver the process outputs. 
 Seven Basic Quality Tools 
 The  seven basic quality tools were described in detail earlier in the Plan Quality 
Management process. They can be used in the Control Quality process to graphically 
represent and analyze any of the data gathered. 
 
■ Exam Tip   By now you have probably realized that the seven basic quality tools can be 
used as tools or techniques in any of the quality management processes. 
 Statistical Sampling 
 As part of completing a check on the quality of the deliverables, you may choose to use 
statistical sampling as a tool or technique, if the number of deliverables is too great to test 
each one individually or if the sampling would involve destructive testing. 
 Inspection 
 Inspection  is one of the key tools of the Control Quality process. It is a physical 
examination of the deliverable to measure and determine whether it complies with the 
required standards. As a result of completing inspection, you will generally produce a 
variety of measurements indicating compliance or noncompliance with the required 
deliverable standards. 
 Approved Change Request Review 
 It is one thing to have  approved change requests ; it is another to ensure that they have 
been implemented as per the change documentation. The way to do this is via the use of 
an  approved change request review . 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
266
 
REAL WORLD
 I have often seen assumptions made about approved change requests being 
carried out. Some people seem to think that simply because the change has been 
requested and considered and a decision has been made to approve it, the change 
is automatically carried out. Unfortunately, this isn’t always the case. This is one 
of the reasons you should record all change requests, their status, any decisions 
made, and any required follow-up actions on your change-request log. Furthermore, 
assigning someone to be responsible for not only carrying out the change but also 
checking that it was carried out correctly is an important factor in making sure all of 
your approved change requests are implemented. 
 Outputs 
 The major outputs from the Control Quality process are the following. 
 Quality Control Measurements 
 The  quality control measurements are the documents you produce as a result of carrying 
out the Quality Control processes and activities. They should be concise and presented 
in an appropriate format for easy communication, presentation, and tracking. Quality 
control measurements go on to be used as an input into the Perform Quality Assurance 
process. 
 Validated Changes 
 The  validated changes output involves checking that approved change requests and 
any required modifications have been inspected and comply with the change-request 
documentation. Validated changes go on to be used as an input into the Monitor and 
Control Project Work process. 
 
■ Exam Tip   The process of validation occurs after the process of verification. The process 
of validation is an important one to understand, as well as how it is different from the 
process of verification. Verification is about confirmation that the product, service, or result 
produced complies with agreed specifications or requirements. It is primarily an internal 
process performed by the delivering organization prior to submitting the product, service, or 
result for validation, which involves the customer as well. Validation also involves a check 
that the product, service, or result meets stakeholder requirements. Verification occurs 
before validation.

 Verified Deliverables 
 You will recall that  deliverables are one of the inputs into the Control Quality process. 
After they have been subjected to the appropriate tools and techniques to check that they 
conform to the required standards, if they are accepted,  verified deliverables become 
an output from the process. Verified deliverables go on to be used as an input into the 
Validate Scope process. 
 Work Performance Information 
 You will recall that work performance data is used as an input into the Control Quality 
process. This is the raw data collected about work performance to date. After it is 
subjected to the appropriate tools and techniques, it becomes  work performance 
information . Work performance information then goes on to be used as an input into the 
Monitor and Control Project Work process. 
 Change Requests 
 As a result of carrying out the Control Quality process, there may be a reason to raise 
a change request to deal with defect repairs, required modifications, or corrective or 
preventive actions. All change requests should be prepared, submitted, and assessed as 
per the documented and defined change-control process. Change requests go on to be 
used as an input into the Perform Integrated Change Control process.  
 Project Management Plan Updates 
 Specific parts of the project management  plan that may be updated as a result of the Control 
Quality process are the quality management plan and the process improvement plan.  
 Project Document Updates 
 Specific project  documents that may be updated as a result of the Control Quality process 
are any relevant quality standards or agreements relating to any aspect of the quality 
management process. 
 Organizational Process Asset Updates 
 Specific organizational process  assets that may be updated include lessons learned 
databases and any blank templates for any aspect of the organization’s quality 
management process.

 Quick Check 
 
 1. 
 What is the main focus of the Control Quality process? 
 
 2. 
 Which three inputs into the Control Quality process are 
outputs from the same process in a more refined state? 
 
 3. 
 How does inspection differ from audits? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 The main focus of the Control Quality process is to check that 
the project deliverables meet the required and documented 
standards. This is in contrast to the Perform Quality Assurance 
process, which is focused on the processes of the project. 
 
 2. 
 The three inputs are approved change requests, deliverables, 
and work performance data. Each is used as an input into 
the Control Quality process and, after the application of 
appropriate tools, is further refined so that approved change 
requests become validated changes, deliverables become 
verified deliverables, and work performance data becomes 
work performance information. 
 
 3. 
 Inspection is one of the tools of the Control Quality process 
and involves physical examination of the deliverables 
produced by the project to determine whether they conform 
to the required standards. On the other hand, audits are 
used as a tool in the Perform Quality Assurance process to 
check whether processes are in place and that they are being 
followed correctly. 
 Chapter Summary 
 The Quality Management knowledge area is focused on the development of the quality 
management plan and then using this quality management plan to carry out quality 
assurance to check the project processes and quality control to check the project 
deliverables.
• 
 The quality tools and techniques are common to all three quality 
processes. 
• 
 The Plan Quality Management process produces the quality 
management plan for the project, which sets out guidelines and 
processes for checking both the processes and deliverables for the 
project. 
• 
 The Perform Quality Assurance process focuses on checking that 
processes are in place and are being followed. It uses a variety of 
tools and techniques, including audits. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ QUALITY MANAGEMENT
269
• 
 The Control Quality process is focused on checking project 
deliverables and approved change requests for conformity to 
requirements.

 CHAPTER 7  
 Human Resource 
Management 
 This chapter focuses on Project Human Resource Management. Similar to the other 
knowledge areas, it begins with a planning process, which in this case produces a human 
resource management plan. It then has three executing processes that focus on carrying 
out the contents of the human resource management plan. The three executing processes 
focus on acquiring your project team members, developing those project team members, 
and managing them. 
 You may need to pay particular attention in this chapter to the different theories 
relating to management, motivation, and development of people, because many of them 
may be new to you. 
 The PMBOK  ®   Guide Processes 
 Project Human Resource Management Knowledge Area 
 The four processes in the Project Human Resource Management knowledge area are 
as follows:
• 
 Plan Human Resource Management (planning process)  
• 
 Acquire Project Team (executing process)  
• 
 Develop Project Team (executing process) 
• 
 Manage Project Team (executing process) 
 
■ Exam Tip   Did you notice that this knowledge area is the only one without a monitoring 
and controlling process? It is assumed that functional managers will carry out monitoring 
and controlling activities associated with human resources, because they generally have 
final authority over human resources working on your project. Even in a strong matrix 
structure, although the project manager has authority, the people allocated to the project 
eventually go back to the functional manager. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
280
 What Is Project Human Resource Management? 
 Project Human  Resource Management is focused on the processes of developing a 
human resource management plan, which allows you to identify how you will recognize 
which people you want as part of your project team; when you will require them and for 
how long; and how you will get those people and develop, reward, motivate, and manage 
them. It covers all aspects relating to your project team, including you as a project 
manager. 
 
REAL WORLD
 I have always found the term  human resource to be a little too technical and clinical 
for my liking. Machines are resources, and there is an element of expected decay, 
obsolescence, and replacement with the term. People are not resources. So, if you 
are having the same trouble, I suggest using the much friendlier term  project people 
management for this section. Of course, for the exam, you need to use  Project 
 Human Resource Management . 
 
■ Exam Tip   In considering all the issues and topics relevant to human resource 
management, there are a host of ancillary topics around interpersonal skills, leadership, 
ethics, and organizational and motivational theories that you must also know for the exam. 
This chapter covers a wide range of topics relating to all these different aspects of Project 
Human Resource Management. 
 Plan Human Resource Management 
 
■ More Info   Plan Human Resource Management 
 You can read more about the Plan Human Resource Management process in the PMBOK 
Guide, 5th edition, in Chapter   9  , section 9.1. Table  7-1 identifies the process inputs, tools 
and techniques, and outputs. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
281
 The Plan Human Resource Management process is a planning process with a single 
output: the human resource management plan. 
 The Plan Human Resource Management process covers the following planning 
domain task:
• 
 Task 5: Develop the human resource management plan by defining 
the roles and responsibilities of the project team members, in order 
to create a project organizational structure and provide guidance 
regarding how resources will be assigned and managed.  
 Inputs 
 The Plan Human Resource Management process uses some or all of the following inputs 
as part of the development of the human resource management plan for the project. 
 Project Management Plan 
 The key elements of the project management plan that are useful as inputs into the Plan 
Human Resource Management process are a description of the work to be completed 
to determine what skills will be required and elements from the project schedule and 
schedule management plan that are useful for determining time constraints. The project 
management plan is an output from the Develop Project Management Plan process. 
 Activity Resource Requirements 
  Activity resource requirements  contain information about the specific activities to be 
completed and the resources, particularly human resources, needed to complete the work. 
Activity resource requirements are an output from the Estimate Activity Resources process. 
 Enterprise Environmental Factors 
 The specific  enterprise environmental factors that are useful as inputs into this process 
are the external organization culture, existing employees, existing organizational 
employment and personnel policies, and external marketplace conditions affecting 
availability and cost of hiring people.

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
282
 Organizational Process Assets 
 The specific  organizational process assets that may be important inputs into the 
development of your human resource management plan include any specific organizational 
policies, process, or guidelines for the recruitment, reward, and retention of people, and any 
historical information about what has and has not worked on previous projects.   
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following  tools  and techniques are available to be used to develop the inputs into this 
process in order to produce the human resource management plan. 
 Organizational Charts and Position Descriptions 
 A foundational concept of the Plan Human Resource Management process is the need 
to define a role for everyone on the project and define the responsibilities for each role. 
In order to do this, you can use  organizational charts and position descriptions  to clearly 
show what roles there are, how they are linked by reporting lines, and their expected 
experience, technical skills, duties, and responsibilities. 
 Before we go any further, let’s focus on describing all the roles that can exist in a 
typical project. In addition to the individual and defined project team member roles, 
the primary roles in the world of project management are the project manager, sponsor, 
functional manager, program manager, and portfolio manager. 
 The  project manager is one of the key roles in the successful delivery of any product, 
service, or result because this role takes full responsibility for the project. The project 
manager works closely with the program manager, because the project manager’s project 
may be part of a program, and also works closely with the portfolio manager, because the 
project is part of a portfolio. The role of project manager is obviously central to the profession 
of project management. The project manager is the person assigned to lead the project 
team and take responsibility for the delivery of the project’s objectives. This is different from 
the work of a  functional manager , who takes responsibility for a functional unit within an 
organizational structure. In some instances, a project manager may report to a functional 
manager, but other times the role may report to a program or portfolio manager. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Not all organizations have program managers or portfolio managers, nor 
should they. Those roles are generally reserved for large, mature organizations. But for the 
exam, unless you are specifically told otherwise in the question, you should assume that the 
scenario has all three roles in an organization. 
 A competent  project manager must have a wide range of skills and experience to be 
successful. These include specific  skills   for the industry in which the manager is working, and 
general management skills; the manager must also demonstrate a high degree of expertise 
in and knowledge about project management, the ability to self-motivate and achieve results 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
283
through high performance, and great personal effectiveness while leading the project. It is 
key to the success of the project manager that this person possess not only the right technical 
skills but also the right interpersonal skills, which are covered in a later section. 
 
■ Exam Tip   On the exam, you must always assume that the role of the project manager 
is proactive and in control of the project. The project manager takes complete responsibility 
for the project, which may differ from your experience. 
 
REAL WORLD
 In my opinion, the easiest way to describe the role of the project manager is to 
replace the title  project manager with  general manager of a project . We all know 
what a general manager does, and a project manager really is the general manager 
of a project and must take the same senior role. 
 In addition to the role of project manager, there are also the roles of  project 
coordinator and  project expeditor . A project coordinator has less power and authority 
than a project manager, and a project expeditor has little or no power and authority. 
 
■ Exam Tip   For the exam, look for any project role description that differs on the basis of 
the amount of power and authority. High levels of both refer to a project manager; mid levels 
refer to a project coordinator; and low levels refer to a project expeditor. 
 The  project team is made up of the staff who have been assigned or recruited to 
the project to provide technical skills. It includes at its core the project manager, the 
direct members of the project team, and also the members of the wider project team. 
The difference between direct members of the project team and members of the wider 
project team relates to whether they are assigned full-time or part-time to the project. If 
you are working in a matrix organizational structure, team members come from different 
functional areas. If it is a strong matrix organization, the team members report solely to 
the project manager; if it is a weak matrix organization, the team members still report to 
the functional managers. 
 The exact composition of any project team depends on the organizational culture, 
organizational structure, scope of work, geographic location of the work to be done, and 
availability of team members. There are four categories of project team. The first is the 
 dedicated project team , where the majority of the team members are working full-time on 
the project. Second is the  part-time project team , where functional managers have more 
power and authority and assignment to the project is generally part-time for both the 
project manager and the project team members. A third type of project team is created 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
284
from the  partnership between two or more organizations that agree to assign staff to 
the project team. This offers flexibility and the ability to secure resources and technical 
experience that any one organization may not have. The fourth and final form of project 
team is the  virtual  team , which is increasingly used with the broadening geographical 
spread of team members throughout the world. Bringing together a virtual  team   and 
getting it to perform well is a challenge for any project manager and requires special 
attention to overcome potential obstacles. 
 
REAL WORLD
 It is increasingly common in the real world for team members to be drawn from 
differing geographical locations. These locations can be different parts of a city, 
different parts of a country, or even different countries. In addition to the problems 
presented by a lack of colocation and face-to-face communication when developing 
a high-performing team, a number of other problems can potentially adversely affect 
the outcome of the project. A project manager working in or with a virtual team 
needs to be mindful and aware of the potential problems that can arise and address 
them early and consistently throughout the life of the project. 
 A  program manager leads a program of projects. A  program of projects  is a group 
of projects that are linked in some way. They may share resources, or they may be 
contributing to a greater deliverable. The role of the program manager is to manage 
competing interests between the projects. A  portfolio manager has responsibility for a 
 portfolio of projects —all the projects an organization is undertaking—and is usually in 
charge of project-selection processes to ensure that all projects align with organizational 
strategy and meet documented financial and nonfinancial criteria. 
 A  project sponsor is the person responsible for providing the initial statement of 
work, approving the financial spend on the project, signing the project charter and 
approving any changes to it, and being the project champion. The person in this role is 
internal to the organization and sits on the  project steering committee  or group. The role of 
the project steering committee or  group is to provide high-level support, oversight, and, if 
required, governance. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Don’t get the roles of project sponsor and client mixed up. The project 
sponsor is always internal, whereas the client may be internal or external but is the recipient 
of the deliverable. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
285
 
REAL WORLD
 Many people assume that the client is responsible for financing a project. This isn’t 
true. The client pays the bills after the costs have been incurred. Someone in the 
organization, usually the project sponsor, must approve the organization’s incurring 
the costs, such as wages or salaries and materials purchased to complete the work, 
and financing these costs until such time as the client pays the bills. 
 Figure  7-1  shows the hierarchy of roles from project steering committee down to 
members of the wider project team. 
 Figure 7-1.  The  descending hierarchy of groups and individuals in a project 
 The  functional manager is a role that a project manager needs to be mindful of, 
because the majority of organizations are organized around functional areas, even if 
they are acting as matrix organizations. The functional manager is usually a general 
manager or team leader of a particular group of technical experts, and this manager 
assigns staff members to the project for the duration of the project. The project manager 
must negotiate with the functional manager for the people; who has the most power in 
the relationship will affect availability of people for the project. This issue is discussed in 
more depth in an upcoming section. 
 Now that the typical roles in an organization have been covered, you can use 
organizational charts and position descriptions to help produce the human resource

management plan. There are several graphical and text-based formats for doing this. The 
most popular are organizational charts, matrix charts such as the   RACI chart, and  text-
based descriptions , such as those often used for job descriptions. 
 The  organizational chart is another example of a breakdown structure such as 
the work breakdown structure ( WBS) . It takes a high-level concept—in this case, the 
organization—and breaks it down into its component roles. It starts at the top with the chief 
executive officer (CEO) or general manager and breaks down the organization into lower-
level roles such as line manager, team leader, team member, and specific technical roles. 
In addition to using the chart to break down organization-wide roles, you can also use it to 
break down project roles, in which case you have the project manager at the top and lower-
level project roles beneath this. Figure  7-2 shows an example of an organizational chart.  
 Figure 7-2.  An example of an organizational chart 
 Another popular way to display not only roles but also the responsibilities of different 
roles is a matrix-based chart called a  RACI chart . A RACI chart is a type of  responsibility 
assignment matrix (RAM). A  RACI chart describes who is responsible (R), who is 
accountable (A), who will be consulted (C), and who will be informed (I) about different 
activities. Being  responsible for an activity means producing or actually completing 
the work, whereas being  accountable for an activity means having to answer for the 
work being done or not being done on time. A single person can be both responsible 
and accountable for an activity, and if your project is large enough to have many team 
members, you can split the responsibility and accountability as a means of ensuring 
better management of activities. Figure  7-3 shows an example of a RACI chart. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
287
 
REAL WORLD
 I have used several forms of the RACI chart on different projects. Some smaller 
projects simply have an RA chart. I also did some work for a large company that had 
its own variant, an RASCI chart, with the S standing for  support , to indicate which 
team members were providing technical support. 
 Networking 
 Networking  is the action of interacting with and building relationships with other people 
for political and influencing purposes. Networking can be undertaken in both informal 
and formal ways. Networking is important because getting the people you want when you 
want them usually involves negotiation with other managers. 
 
REAL WORLD
 I have always found that networks are a great way to increase your influence and 
reputation. At the heart of any network connection is a strong personal relationship 
and reputation. Take time to build genuine relationships, and your networking efforts 
will pay off more. 
 Organizational Theory 
 As part of  your  efforts to produce an appropriate human resource management plan for 
your project, you need to have a good grasp of organizational theory and how it impacts 
on human resource management and project success. The way in which an organization 
is structured can influence its culture, its strategy, its personnel recruitment, and the 
projects it chooses to do. Different organizational structures have different strengths 
and weaknesses when it comes to successful project management. The main types of 
organizational structures are the functional organization, the matrix organization, and 
the projectized organization. The organizational structure is usually demonstrated in the 
organizational breakdown structure or organization  chart . 
 Figure 7-3.     An example of a RACI chart showing team member responsibility and 
 accountability 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
288
 In a  functional organizational structure , there is a chief executive officer (CEO) or 
similar at the top. Under the CEO are general managers, or functional managers, of each 
functional area. Below the general managers are team leaders. There may also be shared 
services, such as human resources and finance, directly reporting to the CEO as well. In 
this sort of organizational structure, staff report directly to the functional manager, who is 
responsible for assigning them to work or deciding on their remuneration packages and 
ensuring that they are part of the team; thus, the functional manager has all the power 
and authority. If an organization wants to undertake a project, generally the project is 
staffed by members from one functional area, and there can be little cooperation and 
coordination between the different functional areas. A project manager working in this 
sort of organizational structure will have great difficulty in obtaining the people and 
finances needed to complete the project without first getting approval from the functional 
manager. Figure  7-4 shows an example of a functional organizational structure.  
 Figure 7-4.  An organizational chart showing a  functional organizational structure 
 A  matrix organization is one in which a functional structure exists, but the 
organization has decided to do projects by using people  and resources from different 
functional areas. The project manager is assigned a team and access to resources from 
these different functional areas, and both the project manager and functional manager 
have power and authority in deciding the allocation and use of people. 
 In a  weak matrix organization , most of the power and authority resides with the 
functional manager. Due to the project manager’s low levels of power and authority in a 
weak matrix organizational structure, the role may more appropriately be described as a 
project expeditor or project coordinator. In a  strong matrix organization , most of the power 
and authority is with the project manager. Between strong and weak forms of the matrix 
organization is the  balanced matrix , where power and authority is shared between functional 
managers and project managers. Figure  7-5 shows an example of a matrix organization with 
the dotted lines around roles indicating which people are assigned to the project.  
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
289
 Projectized organizations are organized according to the projects they undertake. 
In this instance, the project manager acts almost as a functional manager, but instead of 
having a team of specialists and a functional area, the project manager has the project 
team, which may consist of several different technical specialties. In this instance, the 
project manager acts as general manager of the project and has full power and authority. 
Figure  7-6 shows an example of a  projectized  organization .

 Figure 7-6.  Projectized organizational structure 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
290
 
REAL WORLD
 In the real world, you often have to negotiate with functional managers for access 
to resources and money. Your ability to be a skilled communicator, influencer, and 
negotiator will come to the fore in this instance to enable you to get the resources 
you require when you need them. 
 Table  7-2 shows the allocation of power and authority between functional managers 
and project managers in the different types of organizational structures.

■ Exam Tip   It is important for the exam that you understand the differences in power 
and authority in each of the different organizational structures. In the absence of any further 
information provided in the question, any questions in relation to this topic assume first that 
you are working in a matrix form of organizational structure and second that it is a strong 
matrix.

 Expert Judgment 
 Expert judgment  from functional managers, current and potential team members, the 
project sponsor, and other stakeholders will be  useful as you put together your human 
resource management plan. 
 Meetings 
 Meetings  are a useful way to bring together members of the project team and other 
stakeholders so that they can contribute to the development of the human resource 
management plan. 
 Outputs 
 After applying the appropriate tools and techniques to the selected inputs, the Plan 
Human Resource Management process has the following output. 
 Human Resource Management Plan 
 The Plan Human Resource Management process has the human resource management 
plan as its sole output. Similar to other management plans, the human resource 
management plan provides a description of the overall approach to human resource 
management and details specific guidelines on acquiring, developing, training, 
motivating, rewarding, and managing your project team members. In addition to the 
text describing all of these aspects, the human resource management plan also includes 
diagrams such as organizational charts and RACI charts. 
 An important sub-plan of the human resource management plan is the  staffing 
management  plan , which describes when and how project team members are to be 
recruited. The  staffing management plan identifies whether project team members are 
to be recruited from internal or external sources, and the process by which they will be 
described, contacted, assessed, and appointed. 
 The human resource management plan is a subsidiary of the project management 
plan and is used as an input into the three human resource management executing 
processes. It is also used as an input into the Estimate Costs process, because it provides 
information about personnel costs, and it is used as an input into the Identify Risks 
process.

 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 The main purpose of the human resource management plan 
is to guide your actions in identifying, obtaining, rewarding, 
training, motivating, and managing your project team 
members.  
 
 2. 
 The primary role of the project sponsor is to provide financial 
support, provide project charter approval, appoint the project 
manager, and provide political support for the project. 
 
 3. 
 In this instance you are working in a weak matrix, because the 
functional manager has the power and authority. 
 Acquire Project Team 
 
■ More Info   Acquire Project Team 
 You can read more about the Acquire Project Team process in the PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, 
in Chapter   9 , section 9.2. Table  7-3 identifies the process inputs, tools and techniques, and 
outputs.

 The Acquire Project Team process is an executing process that uses the human 
resource management plan for guidance to check and confirm the availability of project 
team members and have them assigned to, or recruited to, the project for the period of 
time their services are required. If you can’t get the human resources you require with the 
skills you need them to have at the time you need them, this will greatly affect the chances 
of project success. Additionally, in acquiring project team members, you need to be 
aware of any local or national employment legislation, collective bargaining agreements, 
typical employment contracts, and any other relevant guidelines. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
293
 The Acquire Project Team process covers the following executing domain task:
• 
 Task 1: Acquire and manage project resources by following the 
human resource and procurement management plans, in order to 
meet project requirements. 
 Inputs 
 The Acquire Project Team process uses some or all of the following inputs. 
 Human Resource Management Plan 
 The  human resource management plan is obviously a key input into the Acquire Project 
Team process because it provides a description of how you will carry out acquiring 
the people you need for your project team. More specifically, the human resource 
management plan includes a description of the roles and responsibilities required during 
the life of the project to complete the project activities, and the project organizational 
chart showing the  number and reporting lines of people on the project team. 
 One of the most important parts of the human resource management plan to be 
used as an input into the Acquire Project Team process is the staffing management 
plan, because it specifically addresses how project team members are to be acquired. 
The human resource management plan is an output from the Plan Human Resource 
Management process. The staffing management plan is a subsidiary plan of the human 
resource management plan. 
 Enterprise Environmental Factors 
 The specific types of  enterprise environmental factors that will be useful in acquiring your 
project team are any local government or industry regulations affecting the employment 
of project personnel. Other enterprise environmental factors may also include general 
organizational structure issues. 
 Organizational Process Assets 
 The specific types of  organizational process assets that will assist you in acquiring your 
project team members include any relevant organizational policies, processes, and 
guidelines relating to the acquisition and employment of people. Additionally, historical 
information and lessons learned from previous projects are also useful organizational 
process assets. 
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques are used on the inputs to deliver the Acquire Project 
Team process outputs. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
294
 Preassignment 
 Preassignment    is the advanced allocation of project team members to your project. This 
can happen as a result of both internal and external processes in which specific people 
are assigned to the project as a result of the skills and experience they may have or 
because of particular contractual arrangements. 
 
REAL WORLD
 I’ve found that as a general rule, up to half of my project team members are 
allocated on a preassigned basis due to their particular skills and knowledge. 
This can be a good thing, because you know you have people with the right 
skills allocated to your project from the beginning. There can be a high degree of 
uncertainty in the process of trying to acquire people for your project via either 
negotiation with functional managers or an external recruitment process. 
 Negotiation 
 Negotiation  for project team members occurs in several ways. First, you need to negotiate 
with functional managers to get the staff you want when you want them. Your ability to 
negotiate in the circumstances reflects your power and authority. If you are working in 
a weak matrix environment, you have little power and authority, and the allocation of 
project team members to your project will be at the discretion of the functional manager. 
However, if you are working in a strong matrix organization, you have the power and 
authority to get the project team members you need when you need them. 
 The process of  negotiation also occurs with external providers of project team 
members, or during the process of recruiting a project team member and the negotiation 
of a particular employment contract. 
 Given the importance of negotiation in acquiring project team members in a timely 
and cost-effective manner, it is important that you have good negotiation skills.  
 Acquisition 
 The term  acquisition    in this instance means an external process of advertising for, 
interviewing, and negotiating employment contracts with project team members. Often 
this process is best left to professionals with experience in advertising and recruitment.  
 Virtual Teams 
 The use of  virtual teams  is becoming increasingly common throughout the world as 
technology allows people to work together in ways they previously couldn’t. These virtual 
teams can be separated by different floors in a building, can be in different cities, or can 
even be in different countries. The advantages of a virtual team are that it allows you to 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
295
use the skills and experience of people who may not be able to co-locate in the same 
area, and also to cater to individual preferences in terms of work hours or work locations. 
The use of virtual teams is also a legitimate option when a project may incur large travel 
expenses in order to host face-to-face meetings. A drawback of virtual teams is that it is 
difficult to maintain effective communication by using any sort of technology, such as 
e-mail, telephone, or video conference. 
 Multicriteria Decision Analysis 
 The process of  acquiring  project team members can also use  multicriteria decision 
analysis  so that you can take into account a variety of criteria in order to make the best 
decision about who should be selected to work on the project. In this instance, you 
choose the criteria that are relevant; these criteria can be such things as cost,    experience, 
and availability. You give each of these a weight and then score individual candidates, 
 multiply their scores by the weightings, and arrive at a total score. By ranking each 
candidate by their total score, you can determine your preferred candidates.   
 Outputs 
 The Acquire Project Team process produces some or all of the following outputs. 
 Project Staff Assignments 
 A key output from the Acquire Project Team process is, of course, the  project staff 
assignment s. Project staff assignments provide documentation of project team members’ 
names, roles and responsibilities, contact details, and other relevant information that 
allows all interested stakeholders to view who is part of the project team, their roles, and 
how to contact them. The  project staff assignments go on to be used as an input into the 
Manage Project Team and Develop Project Team processes. 
 Resource Calendars 
 Resource calendars are a useful output from the Acquire Project Team process because 
they document when people are available to work on the project. At a high level, they 
include such things as weekends or public holidays; at a lower and more specific 
level, they include when personnel actually work according to their individual work 
agreements and any known holidays they are taking. The resource calendars go on to be 
used as an input into the Develop Project Team process, as well as the Estimate Activity 
Resources, Estimate Activity Durations, Develop Schedule, and Determine Budget 
processes. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

 Project Management Plan Updates 
 The specific parts of the project management plan that may be updated as a result of 
the Acquire Project Team process are the human resource  management plan and any 
documents affected by the human resource management plan. 
 Quick Check 
 
 1. 
 Why is the human resource management plan an important 
input into the Acquire Project Team process?  
 
 2. 
 What is meant by the term  preassignment ? 
 
 3. 
 Why are negotiation skills useful during the Acquire Project 
Team process? 
 
 4. 
 What is the advantage gained in using multicriteria decision 
analysis? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 The human resource management plan and the staffing 
management plan provide specific guidance on how the 
process of acquiring your project team members will be 
carried out. 
 
 2. 
 Preassignment involves having team members allocated to 
your project before the project begins as a result of specific 
skills and experience or as a result of contractual negotiations. 
 
 3. 
 Negotiation skills are important because when you are 
recruiting project team members, you may have to negotiate 
with their functional managers or, if you are recruiting team 
members from the open employment marketplace, you will 
have to negotiate employment contracts with them directly.  
 
 4. 
 Using multicriteria decision analysis allows you to rank 
prospective team members based on important attributes to 
decide who should  be  recruited. 
 Develop Project Team 
 
■ More Info   Develop Project Team 
 You can read more about the Develop Project Team process in the PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, 
in Chapter   9 , section 9.3. Table  7-4 identifies the process inputs, tools and techniques, and 
outputs. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
297
 The Develop Project Team process is an executing process that uses the human 
resource management plan to improve individual and  team performance so that team 
members can contribute to a greater chance of project success. The goal is to develop a 
high-performing team, and a key concept is that the project manager has responsibility 
for this, must lead by example, and must actively seek to continuously develop the team. 
Thus, it is important that project managers actively develop and practice their leadership 
skills and knowledge of how to build a high-performing team. 
 The Develop Project Team process covers the following executing  domain task: 
• 
 Task 2: Manage task execution based on the project management 
plan by leading and developing the project team, in order to 
achieve project deliverables. 
 Inputs 
 The following inputs are used in the Develop Project Team process. 
 Human Resource Management Plan 
 The  human resource management plan is a critical input into the Develop Project 
Team process because it sets out and describes how the process of developing a high-
performing team will occur. The human resource management plan is an output from the 
Plan Human Resource Management process. 
 Project Staff Assignments 
 The  project staff assignments describe who the individual project team members are and 
their current roles, experience, and ability. This information is useful for identifying team 
members and deciding who needs training. Project staff assignments are an output from 
the Acquire Project Team process.

 Resource Calendars 
  Resource calendars  , which identify when the project team members are available to work, 
are an important input into the Develop Project Team process because they let you know 
when people are available to participate in team-building activities.  Resource calendars 
 are an output from the Acquire Project Team process. 
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques of this process can be used on the separate inputs to 
deliver the process outputs. 
 Interpersonal Skills 
 Interpersonal skills  are key skills for any project manager to have so that the manager 
can effectively contribute to the development of the team. Team development is not a 
mechanical exercise; it is one built on relationships between people. Thus, interpersonal 
skills, or  soft skills , are useful in building these relationships and contributing toward a 
high-performing project team. 
 A project manager must develop and learn a wide range of interpersonal skills to use 
at the appropriate times. These include the following 11 skills:
• 
 Leadership 
• 
 Team building 
• 
 Motivation 
• 
 Communication 
• 
 Influencing 
• 
 Decision making 
• 
 Political and cultural awareness 
• 
 Negotiation 
• 
 Trust building 
• 
 Conflict management 
• 
 Coaching 
 You  now look  at  each of these skills in more detail. 
 Leadership 
 Leadership is the purposeful influencing of followers. A leader must have a clear vision 
of where they want to take their followers. In relation to a project, a  vision  can be a 
successful project in terms of time, cost, and quality. Because leadership is essentially 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
299
a relationship between leader and follower, it must be built like any other human 
 re lationship on respect and trust, which are key elements of effective leadership. 
 Project managers are responsible for developing their own leadership abilities 
and must realize that different situations call for different leadership styles or the 
demonstration of a different set of leadership competencies. Because leadership is 
situational, the type of leadership required over time can change. Figure  7-7 shows how 
different leadership styles can change from a more autocratic style at the beginning of 
a project to a more participatory or supporting style toward the end of the project. This 
model indicates that a leader trusts the team members and gives away some power. Both 
trust and the ability to give away power are important attributes of a good leader. 
 Figure 7-7.  The types of project leadership required at different points in a project 
 Fielder’s contingency theory states that a leader’s effectiveness is contingent on two 
sets of factors: whether the leader is task-oriented or relationship-oriented  and  whether 
the environment is stressful or calm. A task-oriented leader is more effective in stressful 
situations, and a relationship-oriented leader is more  effective in calm situations. 
 Being in a position of leadership gives power to the project manager, and a good 
project manager recognizes the responsibility that comes with power. If used well, power 
can be a great way to lead project team members, inspire people, and motivate people. 
If used incorrectly by a project manager, power can create hostility, demotivate an entire 
team, and cause staff to leave. A project manager can use five forms of power to assist in 
leadership of and negotiation for the project team.
• 
 Formal or legitimate power is based on the position you hold as a 
manager. It should be viewed as an interim form of power. People 
may respect you initially because you are the manager, but your 
subsequent actions could cause this form of power to become 
invalid; therefore, it is not the best form of power to use. 
• 
 The power to reward people is a good form of power because you use 
it to incentivize good performance and discourage poor performance. 
It should not be used to blackmail or manipulate people.  
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
300
• 
 The power to impose penalties or punishment on people is never 
the best form of power to use, because it always generates 
negative feedback in both explicit and subtle ways. 
• 
 Expert power is an excellent form of power to use because it is 
ascribed to you by others due to your respected position as a 
technical expert. You are viewed as the expert in a particular area 
and, as such, people look up to you. 
• 
 Referent  power is a result of your own personality and whether 
 you are liked and respected by other people. 
 Team Building 
 The ability to build teams is a key interpersonal skill for any project manager and leader. 
This topic is covered in more detail in a later section in this chapter. Team-building 
activities go together with  good leadership to build a high-performing team.  
 Motivation 
 The ability to motivate  people and understand what motivates different people is a key 
interpersonal skill for a project manager to have. Different people are motivated by 
different things, and it is important that a project manager have an understanding of 
different motivation theories. The following are the most popular motivation theories that 
a project manager should be aware of:
• 
 Maslow’s hierarchy of needs describes a situation whereby people 
perform at their best when they have the opportunity to be what 
Maslow refers to as  self-actualized . This is the top of the needs 
pyramid he describes. However, people want  to fulfill the bottom 
needs first and cannot fulfill higher needs until lower ones are 
fulfilled, and the current need always takes precedence. So if 
people are concerned about their physiological well-being—for 
instance, if they can’t afford groceries—then they will not be able 
to gain acceptance and esteem. Figure  7-8 shows the levels in 
Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. 
 Figure 7-8.  Maslow’s hierarchy of needs 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
301
• 
 Vroom’s expectancy theory states that the expectation of receiving 
a reward for a certain accomplishment will motivate people to 
work harder, but it only works if the accomplishment is perceived 
to be achievable. People will make a conscious decision to work 
harder if they believe there are achievable outcomes. For a project 
manager, this means some people will respond to rewards offered 
in return for higher productivity, but those rewards need to be 
available, specific, measurable, and relevant to the individual. If 
not, they can prove to be a disincentive. 
• 
 Herzberg’s motivation-hygiene theory states that hygiene factors 
(such as company policies, good supervision, and safe and 
pleasant working conditions) do not motivate, but their absence 
makes staff unsatisfied. Motivation factors (such as achievement, 
work, responsibility, and advancement) motivate, but only if 
hygiene factors are in place. For the project manager leading a 
project team, this means if the working conditions are unpleasant 
or unsafe, offering greater responsibility to people in return 
for more work will not succeed. They will first want the basic 
 workplace environment conditions improved. 
• 
 McClelland’s human motivation, achievement, or three needs 
theory states that people will work not for more money but 
instead for achievement, power, and affiliation. A manager should 
use these three needs to motivate employees. 
 
REAL WORLD
 It is often thought that money is the prime motivator for people. This is true only to 
the point where you pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table. 
The specific amount differs between regions and countries, but at a certain point, 
people have enough money to take care of their essential and basic needs and have 
some discretionary income to be able to afford nonessential things. Above a certain 
amount of money, people are motivated by more intrinsic things such as prestige, 
responsibility, recognition, and authority. I have always found that when working with 
experienced, educated professionals, as I often do in a project, these latter factors 
are much more productive ways to motivate people. 
• 
 McGregor’s theory X and theory Y describe a manager’s attitude 
toward staff or team members. A theory X manager believes 
that team members are inherently unmotivated to work, require 
constant supervision, and can’t be trusted. A theory Y manager 
believes that people want to work, can be trusted, and are 
naturally ambitious and self-motivated. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
302
• 
 Following on from McGregor’s theory X and theory Y comes 
 Ouchi’s theory Z , which tries to increase worker loyalty and 
raise worker productivity by offering a job for life and providing 
support for the employee both in and out of the workplace.       
 
REAL WORLD
 I’m sure we have all dealt with managers who exhibit some theory X attributes. It is 
important to realize that it has been proven that management in a theory X style is 
extremely counterproductive and leads to lower productivity, decreased staff morale, 
and increased staff turnover. As you develop your own managerial style, I encourage 
you to model yourself after those managers you have admired most; they probably 
displayed theory Y attributes. 
 
■ Note  Motivation Theories 
 As part of your own professional development, you may want to read the seminal works by 
the authors mentioned in this section and the works of authors influenced by these people. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Make sure you know the basics of each of these theories for the exam. Don’t 
get confused by an answer with just any old surname in it. If you know the basics, you will 
be able to differentiate between a right answer, a wrong answer, and a made-up answer. 
 Communication 
 Excellent  communication skills  are an essential interpersonal skill for a project 
manager, because communication forms the basis of any relationship. Chapter   8 covers 
communication skills in more detail. 
 Influencing 
 The ability  to  proactively influence people is an important interpersonal skill that a 
project manager must have. It is achieved through being genuine, leading by example, 
establishing networks, and adjusting communication styles to suit the audience. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
303
 
■ Exam Tip   A project manager must always be proactively influencing all aspects of the 
project, potential change requests, and stakeholder expectations. 
 
REAL WORLD
 There is a fine line between influencing and manipulation. Manipulation usually has 
a secret agenda and seeks to force people to do something they wouldn’t normally 
do. Influencing is a political act that is built on relationships, mutual understanding, 
and an attempt to elicit cooperation from others. 
 Decision Making 
 Decision-making skills are essential for any project manager. In making decisions, project 
managers normally use four  basic decision styles, depending on time constraints, trust 
between team members, quality of information, and ability to get acceptance. These 
decision styles are  command ,  consultation ,  consensus , and, if all else fails,  coin flip . In 
addition to these reactive means of making a decision, there is a more formal six-phase 
decision-making model developed by Morris and Sashkin. In this model, the six phases in 
making a decision are as follows:
 
 1. 
 Problem definition 
 
 2. 
 Problem solution generation 
 
 3. 
 Ideas to action 
 
 4. 
 Solution action planning 
 
 5. 
 Solution evaluation planning 
 
 6. 
 Evaluations of the outcome and process 
 Political and Cultural Awareness 
 Political and cultural awareness  should be a focus for project managers because they 
need to develop and demonstrate the skillful use of politics and power in order to be 
successful. Additionally, having an awareness of various cultures and their differences 
enables a project manager to operate more effectively. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
304
 Negotiation 
 Advanced  negotiation skills  are key skills used in several areas in the profession of project 
management. The goal of any negotiation is an agreement from which all parties to the 
agreement will benefit. A win-win outcome is the optimal outcome from a negotiation. 
Complex negotiations may require specialist skills that the project manager may want to 
learn, or the project manager  may  want to bring in experts  to   complete the negotiations.  
 Trust Building 
 Trust building within the team and also with stakeholders is a key interpersonal skill of 
any project manager. Trust is a  reciprocal relationship built on authenticity. A lack of trust 
in your relationships with team members and other stakeholders will adversely affect 
your chances of project success. 
 Conflict Management 
 Conflict management  is covered in more detail in the Manage Project Team process in 
the next section. The key goal of conflict management is to resolve conflict permanently 
and openly wherever possible. 
 Coaching 
 Coaching is an  important  interpersonal skill for the project manager to have and display. 
It involves providing wisdom and experience to others to enable them to develop 
professional and personally. 
 
■ Exam Tip   All negotiations should be entered into in good faith. It is never acceptable 
to coerce weaker parties in a negotiation into an agreement that may be against their best 
interests. 
 Training 
 In order to fully  develop   individuals on your team, you need to offer  training in both 
technical and nontechnical (or  soft ) skills. Training can occur using internal or external 
trainers and can occur in a classroom environment, on the job, or, increasingly, via 
remote or online means. Training needs can be agreed on with team members at regular 
intervals such as during their performance appraisals, or  training  can be provided 
reactively in response to observed needs. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
305
 
■ Exam Tip   You should always assume that you will have to provide training to team 
members and that you have made a commitment to providing training at all times. This is 
particularly important if you come across a question on the exam where a team member 
does not have the right skills to complete an activity. Your first option is always to get them 
the required training. 
 Team-Building Activities 
 Team-building activities can take many forms, but all have the goal of enhancing the 
sense of a single team among everyone working on the project. They can be informal 
or formal, planned or spontaneous, structured or free-flowing. It is important to realize 
that team-building activities are not a one-time event; they are instead a continual and 
ongoing process. 
 
REAL WORLD
 I have always found that having a constant series of both organized and 
spontaneous team-building activities that appeal to team members is not only an 
important way to increase a sense of camaraderie and productivity, but also a great 
way to develop a unique sense of a team identity and culture. 
 The  Tuckman five-stage  model is a convenient way to describe the stages a team 
goes through: forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. Although many 
models show these as linear stages in team development, this isn’t always the case; any of 
the behaviors can be observed at any time. Also, teams can cycle between and within an 
area, and providing awareness of the model and stages to team members can help propel 
your team to the performing stage more quickly. The key point about the model is that 
your goal is to get your team to the performing stage and keep them there with proactive 
team management. 
 Figure  7-9 shows the different  stages of the Tuckman five-stage model against 
performance and time. Although the diagram may indicate an unstoppable linear 
progression, the reality is that  team  dynamics can be highly unstable and teams are 
always in danger of slipping backward into storming behaviors. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
306
 When a group meets for the first time, or when new people join a group, there is 
a period of  forming  as everybody tries to figure out who the other members are, what 
common interests they share, where they sit in the hierarchy, and what their role in the 
team will be. 
 Fairly soon after a new team forms or a new person joins the team, you witness 
 storming behaviors. This is the phase in which the team has to work out what direction 
they will all be going in, which ideas take priority, and which ideas will be cast aside. 
This phase is often one of conflict and argument; it can also include passive-aggressive 
behavior as people on the team jostle for position and power. You will also find storming 
behaviors in the life of an established team when conditions change. Although storming 
is essential, the core issues must be resolved to allow the team to fully move beyond it. 
 Norming  is the process when team members explicitly and implicitly define and 
accept team behaviors and norms. Norming should be the outcome of the storming 
phase. During the process of norming, if the issues from the storming phase haven’t been 
dealt with, it will be very hard for people to settle down into a normalized culture. 
 Performing describes the state where the team has moved through the other 
phases and begins to achieve a high sense of synergy. This is not a static state, however; 
it’s threatened by things such as conflict, team stability, team culture, and external 
influences. The goal is to keep the team at this  stage with constant attention and effort. 
 Adjourning is the final stage for groups, particularly in project management. It occurs 
when individuals leave the project as their jobs end or when the team disbands after 
completing the project. Recognizing and planning for this stage is an important part of 
the project manager’s job. 
 Figure 7-9.  The Tuckman five-stage model of team development 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
307
 
REAL WORLD
 As a project manager, I have been lucky enough to understand teams and their 
development and have often watched people go through the stages described in 
the Tuckman five-stage model of team development. My main focus as a project 
manager has been to make people aware of what was going on and assist them 
to move to the performing stage. However, I must admit to also being involved in 
storming behaviors and being totally oblivious to it until the benefit of hindsight 
revealed it to me. This is one of the main reasons I now often use an independent 
outsider to assist with regular team-building and assessment activities. 
 Ground Rules 
 Having a clear set of  ground rules for expected and accepted group behaviors is an 
important element of successful team building. Ground rules are more often accepted 
and enforced by team members if they have had input into the rules’ creation. 
Common ground rules are related to work hours, cooperation, conflict resolution, and 
participation. 
 Co-location 
 Co-location means trying to  get as many of the project team members in face-to-face 
contact with each other as possible by placing them in the same physical location 
permanently or on a regular basis, such as in team meeting rooms. The purpose of co-
location is to enhance team building through better and more effective communication 
and relationship building. People do these things better when they can see each other. The 
practice of co-locating people in the same space is often called the creation of a  war room .  
 Recognition and Rewards 
 The purpose of  recognition and  rewards is to promote acceptable behaviors and 
discourage unacceptable behaviors from project team members. As  covered already, 
several motivation theories point out that money is not the best way to recognize or 
reward performance or behavior. There are other ways of recognizing and rewarding 
people that are much more effective. Team members appreciate recognition, either 
publically or privately, for good work, and they feel valued when the right rewards are 
given. It is up to project managers to ensure that they are catering to individual needs 
with appropriate recognition and rewards. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
308
 Personnel Assessment Tools 
 A key element of any effort to develop individual team members is a defined way to 
assess individual performances and training needs.  Personnel assessment tools assist 
in formalizing the process of assessing an  individual and planning for their future 
professional development. A common means of doing this is via the regular performance 
appraisal meeting and the use of the 360-degree feedback method. In this method, 
feedback is sought from an individual’s peers, superiors, and those who report to that 
individual  and   then provided in a structured setting in a positive way. 
 
REAL WORLD
 A poorly carried out 360-degree review can backfire very badly. I recall witnessing 
a junior manager carrying out his first 360-degree review on a project manager. 
As part of the team, I was sent a questionnaire that only asked what the project 
manager’s weaknesses were and what that manager had done wrong that had to 
be improved. The very way the questions were phrased set a poor tone, and I heard 
that the project manager walked out of the assessment and refused to take part in 
another with that manager due to the stream of negative feedback. 
 Outputs 
 The major outputs from the Develop Project Team process are the following. 
 Team Performance Assessments 
 The primary output from the Develop Project Team process are the   team performance 
assessments ,  which are prepared by the project manager and document the training 
activities undertaken and still to be undertaken, any team-building activities undertaken 
or planned and their outcome, and individual performance assessments. These 
assessments are measured against any predefined performance expectations. These 
predefined performance expectations can include such metrics as staff turnover, length 
of employment, improvement in individual and team competency, and measures of team 
cohesiveness. 
 Team performance assessments go on to be used as an input into the Manage Project 
Team process.

 The Manage Project Team process is an executing process that uses the human 
resource management plan, team performance assessments, and work performance 
reports to monitor team and individual performance, resolve conflicts, and optimize 
team performance. If as a result of carrying out this process any changes are required, 
then a change request is generated. 
 The Manage Project Team process covers the following executing domain task:
• 
 Task 2: Manage task execution based on the project management 
plan by leading and developing the project team, in order to 
achieve project deliverables. 
 Inputs 
 The following inputs are used in the Manage Project Team process. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
311
 Human Resource Management Plan 
 The  human resource management plan is a critical input into the Manage Project Team 
process because it provides vital information about how human resources (people) will 
be managed, controlled, and assessed. The human resource management plan is an 
output from the Plan Human Resource Management process.  
 Project Staff Assignments 
 Project staff assignments  provide  a list of the project team members, their roles, and 
contact details, all of which are important when managing project team members. Project 
staff assignments are an output from the Acquire Project Team process. 
 Team Performance Assessments 
 Team performance assessments , which are an output from the Develop Project Team 
process, contain information about the performance of both individuals and the entire 
project team. They can include an assessment of how well the team is performing as a 
whole and also individual assessments, such as key performance indicators (KPIs) from 
a person’s job description, an assessment of interpersonal skills, and an assessment of 
contribution to the organization’s goals. They can identify future training needs and 
contribute to professional development both while the team members are on the project 
and also after they leave. 
 Issue Log 
 The  issue log  is used as an input into this process because it may describe and document 
relevant issues relating to management of individual team members or the team as a 
whole. The issue log is an output from the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process. 
 Work Performance Reports 
 Work performance reports , which are an output from the Monitor and Control Project 
Work process,   provide information about how the project team members are actually 
performing compared to the forecasts made about their performance. Because the 
project team members are responsible for all aspects of the project that generate other 
success metrics such as time, cost, quality, and scope, it is important that the work they 
are expected to do generates these performance measurements. The work performance 
reports focus on the performance of the team and individuals. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
312
 Organizational Process Assets 
 The specific types of  organizational process assets  that may be useful in managing 
the project team include any processes or guidelines for acknowledging good work or 
dealing with poor performance, any financial incentive structures that may be applied to 
high performance, and any other relevant organizational guidelines on managing team 
members. 
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques of this process can be used on the separate inputs to 
deliver the process outputs. 
 Observation and Conversation 
 Observation and  conversation are important tools to use because they allow the project 
manager, who has ultimate responsibility for managing a project team, to observe team 
member performance and talk with team members about current performance and 
planned future performance. 
 
REAL WORLD
 I have always found that one of the easiest ways to keep team members engaged is 
regular and ongoing direct communication using face-to-face conversations. You will 
be surprised what information can be exchanged and how quickly relationships can 
be built with a simple 10-minute conversation. 
 Project Performance Appraisals 
 Project performance appraisals  can occur on a regularly scheduled basis or on a more 
spontaneous basis in response to either good or poor performance. They can be 
conducted formally or informally but should always be viewed as an opportunity to 
increase good performance and offer assistance, training, and feedback to improve poor 
performance. 
 Conflict Management 
 Although conflict can at times be a positive and beneficial tool for  soliciting   lateral 
thinking, in most instances conflict is perceived as a negative influence on team 
performance and needs to be addressed promptly, openly, and with a view to resolving 
the core issues in order to ensure that it does not adversely affect team performance. The 
most common causes of conflict between project team members are time constraints, 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
313
project priorities, resource availability, differences in technical opinions, administrative 
processes, project cost and budget, and individual personalities. 
 It is the role of the project manager to take responsibility first of all for setting in place 
ground rules for accepted and expected behaviors in working with the team. If conflict 
does arise, the project manager must take responsibility for dealing with it. There are five 
main ways to deal with conflict, each with a different outcome:
• 
 Withdrawal or avoiding simply avoids dealing with conflict. This 
is definitely not the best way to deal with conflict. 
• 
 Smoothing, or accommodating , tries to resolve conflict by getting 
parties to agree to disagree and put work ahead of conflict. This 
approach doesn’t deal with the root causes, and therefore the 
conflict may flare up again at any time. 
• 
 Compromise, or reconciliation , is a conflict-resolution technique 
that involves each party giving something up in order to resolve 
the conflict. Thus, instead of being a win-win solution, the 
result can often be a lose-lose situation. This approach should 
be viewed as a second-best option to confronting or problem-
solving. 
• 
 Forcing, or directing , involves one party to the conflict pushing 
their viewpoint on another person and trying to have that person 
adopt it,  through  the use of various forms of power. 
• 
 Collaboration, or problem-solving , is the best option for dealing 
with any conflict, because it seeks to deal with the conflict in a 
permanent manner involving multiple viewpoints and resolve it 
openly through consensus. 
 
■ Exam Tip   You should always assume that conflict is inevitable in any project and that 
you will have to deal with it. As the project manager, it is your responsibility to always deal 
with conflict in an open manner that seeks to resolve the core reasons for the conflict. 
Simply ignoring conflict or sweeping it under the carpet is not an acceptable solution, 
because this will eventually manifest in a number of ways, all of which are detrimental to 
your team’s performance and ultimately to the success of the project. 
 Interpersonal Skills 
 A project manager’s interpersonal skills are very useful in managing the  project  team—
particularly leadership, influencing, and decision-making skills. These were covered in 
depth in the Develop Project Team process. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
314
 Outputs 
 The major outputs from the Manage Project Team process are the following. 
 Change Requests 
 As a result of carrying out the Manage Project Team process, you may discover variations 
between what you had planned in terms of team performance and what is actually 
occurring. Additionally, you  may  wish to amend any planned acquisition or development 
activities in order to optimize team performance. Any of these options will involve 
the creation of a change request; the change request will be an input into the Perform 
Integrated Change Control process, where it will be considered as part of the documented 
change-control process. 
 Project Management Plan Updates 
 The specific parts of the project management  plan  that may be updated as a result of the 
Manage Project Team process are the human resource management plan and the staffing 
management plan. 
 Project Document Updates 
 Specific project  documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process 
are such things as the issue log and project staff assignments. 
 Enterprise Environmental Factor Updates 
 The specific  enterprise environmental factors  that may be updated include any 
organizational employee performance appraisal and feedback policies and guidelines. 
 Organizational Process Asset Updates 
 The specific  organizational process assets   that may be updated include any standard 
templates or processes relating to management of personnel, any templates, and any 
historical information or lessons-learned documentation. 
 Quick Check 
 
 1. 
 What is the main focus of the Manage Project Team process? 
 
 2. 
 Why are observation and conversation important tools in 
successfully managing a project team? 
 
 3. 
 What is the best method to use for successful conflict 
management? 

CHAPTER 7 ■ HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
315
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 The main focus of the Manage Project Team process is to 
analyze team performance against forecast team performance 
and undertake actions to ensure high team performance 
by providing feedback and, if necessary, submitting change 
requests to optimize team performance. 
 
 2. 
 Because the management of team performance relies heavily 
on a project manager’s ability to accurately observe what is 
occurring with individual and team performance, the two 
tools of observation and conversation are excellent means of 
gathering information from team members.  
 
 3. 
  The best method to ensure successful conflict management 
is to take a confronting or problem-solving approach that will 
permanently resolve any conflict being dealt with.       
 Chapter Summary 
• 
 The Human Resource Management  knowledge area is focused 
on the areas around planning which people you need, obtaining 
the people you need when you need them, taking responsibility 
to continually train and develop your project team members, and 
monitoring individual and team performance.  
• 
  The Plan Human Resource Management process produces the 
human resource management plan, which guides the three 
subsequent executing processes. 
• 
  The first of the three executing processes in the Human Resource 
Management knowledge area, the Acquire Project Team process, 
uses the human resource management plan to obtain the project 
team members you require with the appropriate skills at the time 
when you need them. 
• 
  The Develop Project Team process, which is an executing 
process, reflects a commitment to understanding the professional 
development and ongoing training needs of individual team 
members and the overall team. The goal of this process is to 
achieve a high-performing project team via a variety of tools and 
techniques. 
• 
 The Manage Project Team process is focused on using the 
human resource management plan, which outlines the expected 
levels of individual and team performance, and checking team 
performance against it. Providing feedback and making changes 
and corrective actions is an important part of the Manage Project 
Team process.

 CHAPTER 8  
 Communications 
Management 
 This chapter focuses on Project Communications Management. Similar to the other 
knowledge areas, it begins with a process of planning, which produces a communications 
management plan. It then has an executing process, Manage Communications, 
focusing on carrying out the communications management plan, and a monitoring and 
controlling process, Control Communications, focused on checking whether project 
communications are meeting stakeholder communication requirements. 
 The PMBOK  ®   Guide Processes 
 Project Communications Management Knowledge Area 
 The three processes in the Project Communications Management  knowledge area 
are as follows:
• 
  Plan Communications Management (planning process)  
• 
  Manage Communications (executing process)  
• 
  Control Communications (monitoring and controlling process)    
 What Is Project Communications Management? 
 Project  communications  management is focused on the processes of developing a 
communications management plan, gathering and distributing project information 
according to the communications management plan, and checking that you are 
completing the communications activities in accordance with the plan. 
 Project communications are absolutely critical for a smooth and successful running 
of any project, whether you are gathering information or disseminating information. You 
should assume that a project manager will spend 90% of their time communicating in 
different ways to different stakeholders. Of this time spent communicating, 50% will be 
spent communicating with project team members because they are the most important 
of the stakeholders. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT
328
 
■ Exam Tip   You should always assume that communication in its many forms is at the 
heart of many issues in project management. If you get a question outlining a problem, and 
one of the potential answers involves better or improved communication, this may be the 
correct choice. 
 
REAL WORLD
 I managed a construction project that I soon realized was actually a communications 
project. At the outset, we focused on building the deliverable and reporting on time 
and cost progress. Very few of the stakeholders were interested in the construction 
project itself; they were interested in how it would affect their business and the 
intended outcome. After about four months of work on what was a two-and-a-half-
year-long project, I was taken aside by the project sponsor and told that despite the 
project being under budget and ahead of time, many stakeholders considered the 
project a failure because I wasn’t communicating effectively with them. I discovered 
that many of these stakeholders weren’t interested in updates about time and 
cost. They had other communication needs. The project sponsor was correct, and 
overnight we changed our focus from a construction project to a communications 
project. We began focusing on what people actually wanted to hear, how they 
wanted to hear it, when they wanted to hear it, and who they wanted to hear it from. 
Within a relatively short time, the project was judged a success. 
 
■ Exam Tip   The project manager should not be in control of every communication, but 
the project manager should control the communications process. 
 Plan Communications Management 
 
■ More Info   Plan Communications Management 
 You can read more about the Plan Communications Management process in the PMBOK 
Guide, 5th edition, in Chapter   10  , section 10.1. Table  8-1 identifies the process inputs, tools 
and techniques, and outputs. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT
329
 The Plan Communications Management process is a planning process with the 
communications management plan as its primary output. In order to successfully 
develop a successful communications management plan, you need to gather and analyze 
information about individual  stakeholders and their communication needs. 
 The Plan Communications Management process covers the following planning 
 domain tasks  :
• 
 Task 6: Develop the communications management plan based on 
the project organization structure and stakeholder requirements, 
in order to define and manage the flow of project information. 
• 
  Task 12: Conduct kick-off meeting, communicating the start of the 
project, key milestones, and other relevant information, in order 
to inform and engage stakeholders and gain commitment.     
 Inputs 
 The Plan Communications Management process uses some or all of the following inputs 
as part of the development of the communications management plan for the project. 
 Project Management Plan 
 The key elements of the project management plan that are useful as  inputs   into the 
Plan Communications Management process are information about project constraints; 
timeframes; and scope, risk, and stakeholder expectations. The project management plan 
is an output from the Develop  Project  Management Plan process.  
 Stakeholder Register 
 The  stakeholder register is an essential input into the Plan Communications Management 
process. It provides information about stakeholders and most likely an assessment of their 
power, interest, impact, or influence on the project. This information can be used to assist 
in the development of a robust and appropriate communications management plan that 
can contribute to the effective management of stakeholder engagement and expectations. 
The stakeholder register is an output from the Identify Stakeholders process.

CHAPTER 8 ■ COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT

 Enterprise Environmental Factors 
 The specific enterprise environmental factor that is useful as an  input into this process is 
the broader organizational structure, because that affects how well communications are 
managed. 
 Organizational Process Assets 
 The specific  organizational process assets that may be an important input into 
the development of your communications management plan include any lessons 
learned and historical information about  successful   or unsuccessful communications 
from past projects, and any blank templates or guidelines for the preparation of the 
communications management plan. 
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques are available to be used to develop the inputs into this 
process in order to produce the communications management plan. 
 Communications Requirements Analysis 
 The purpose of  communications requirements analysis is to obtain a detailed description 
of individual stakeholders and their communications needs. In order to identify the 
communications requirements of individual stakeholders, you can use a variety of 
techniques to identify the stakeholders. These techniques allow you  to  either solicit 
their requirements from them directly or gather information from other sources about 
their requirements. The important thing is to gather and document the stakeholder 
communication requirements so you can then plan how you will meet them. 
 In order to appreciate the number of potential communications channels that can 
exist as part of identifying stakeholders on a project, you can use a formula that shows the 
exponential growth and total number of potential communications channels with every 
additional stakeholder that is identified. The formula is
 
n n
n n
-
(
)

 where  n  equals the number of stakeholders, including yourself. 
 For example, if you have four stakeholders in your project, you have six potential 
communications channels:

 If you have 20 stakeholders, you have 190 potential communication channels:

 The number of communications channels is an important consideration in your 
communications requirements analysis. Figure  8-1 shows how  these  communication 
channels are formed between stakeholders. 
 Figure 8-1.  How to show the number  of communications channels in a project 
 Communications Technology 
 The choice of  communications technology depends on several different factors, 
including urgency, the availability of specific forms of technology, the ease of use of 
that technology, the  project  environment, whether the project team members and 
stakeholders are able to communicate face to face or virtually by using technology, and 
the sensitivity and confidentiality of information. All of these factors influence which 
technologies you choose to use and favor in your communications management plan. It 
is becoming increasingly common to rely on virtual forms of technology, but nothing is as 
good as face-to-face communication. 
 Communications Models 
 Having an awareness of a  communications model , which outlines how communications 
can work, is an important skill for a project manager to have. Communications is not 
just a simple matter of your deciding which information you want to communicate and 
assuming that those with whom you want to communicate will understand what you are 
trying to say. According to the Shannon and Weaver communication model, there is a 
 continual   looping process in action, as Figure  8-2 shows. The sender encodes a message 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT
332
according to their own preferences, prejudices, and particular worldview. The sender 
then transmits this message via whichever communications technology, or medium, 
they have selected to use. As the message is transmitted, it must pass through a particular 
medium, and in doing so it will encounter noise. In this instance, noise does not always 
relate just to acoustic noise, but also includes any other aspects present in the selected 
medium that may interfere with or change the message being transmitted. It can include 
the physical environment, participant energy levels, cultural differences, accents, and 
individual prejudices. 
 The receiver then receives the message and decodes it according to their own 
preferences and prejudices. If the receiver then attempts to send the message on to 
another person or back to the original sender, it must go through the same obstacles again. 
 You can begin to recognize how errors in communication can happen very easily 
even with the best of intent. It is vital that project managers recognize the challenges to 
effective communication and to try to minimize the potential disruption to the messages 
they are trying to send. 
 Figure 8-2.    A communications model showing how a sender encodes and sends a message 
through a medium to a receiver 
 You can  mitigate   some of  the  potential negative effects on communication in this 
model by practicing and being aware of the following five techniques:
• 
 Active listening: With this technique, the listener takes active steps 
to ensure that the message was understood correctly. The result 
is that the listener is more engaged and there is a much better 
transfer of information between sender and receiver. 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT
333
 
REAL WORLD
 Throughout my career as a project manager, the ability to listen and understand 
what people are actually communicating has played an important role in the success 
of projects I have managed. I remember when I was younger and perhaps a little 
more headstrong, and I would take shortcuts when receiving information from 
people, assuming I understood what they were trying to communicate. This, of 
course, led to many misunderstandings and inefficiencies and mistakes that affected 
the chances of project success. I have since learned that being an active listener is 
more important than being an active talker. 
• 
 Effective listening: Similar to active listening, this technique also 
involves the listener or receiver monitoring non-verbal and 
physical communication. 
• 
 Feedback: This consists of cues from the receiver to the sender 
that indicate whether the message has been understood.  
• 
 Nonverbal: This  is  communication in the form of body language, 
posture, and similar. You may be surprised to know that most 
communication is nonverbal and that we are very skilled at 
picking up nonverbal communication. 
• 
 Paralingual: This  type of communication is vocal but not verbal, 
and includes tone of voice, inflections, and volume—how the 
words are said rather than what is said. 
 Communications Methods 
 You can use three broad categories of types of  communications method s:
• 
 Interactive communication :  Where all parties in the 
communications conduct a multidirectional exchange of 
information concurrently. The most common examples of 
interactive communication include team meetings, phone calls, 
and videoconferencing. 
• 
 Push communication :  A form of communication that is sent to 
recipients. It is an effective means of communication to ensure 
that information is distributed as planned and includes e-mail 
messages, reports, memos, press releases, and letters. 
• 
 Pull communication :  Used when recipients can choose to access 
information at their own discretion. Common examples of pull 
communication include intranet and Internet sites and e-learning 
sites. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT
334
 In addition to these categories of communications, there are also different ways in 
which communications can be delivered. These can be formal or informal and verbal or 
written. Table  8-2 shows the possible combinations of these communications forms and 
examples of each.  
 Meetings 
 Meetings are generally a useful way to bring together members of the project team and 
other stakeholders so that they can contribute to the development of the communications 
management plan. Effective meetings feature the use of predistributed agendas, defined 
start and finish times, agreed ground rules, and a focus on decision-making.    
 A particular type of meeting that is useful for communicating the end of project 
planning and the beginning of project execution is the kick-off meeting. The kick-off 
meeting is held with project team members and relevant stakeholders in attendance, 
usually on site, and it signifies the start of execution. It is a particularly effective form 
of communication because it signals to the team and stakeholders that the project is 
progressing, and it  contributes to increased team morale. 
 Outputs 
 After applying the appropriate tools and techniques to the selected inputs, the Plan 
Communications Management process has the following outputs. 
 Communications Management Plan 
 The Plan Communications Management process has the   communications  management 
plan as its primary output. Similar to other management plans, the communications 
management plan provides a guide for completing the communications management 
activities in the project. 
 Your communications management plan identifies individual stakeholders, 
what information they require, when they require that information, how they will 
receive information, from whom the information will be received, and any other 
issues affecting communications. Your communications management plan may also 
outline key messages, general communication strategies, how you will review and 
update the plan, and an overview of the intended outcomes from the communications

management plan. The communications management plan is a subsidiary of the 
project management plan and is used as an input into the other two communications 
management processes. 
 
REAL WORLD
 Keep in mind that a lack of communication is a communication in itself. Some 
stakeholders will take a lack of communication as a sign of arrogance and 
indifference. I have always found that the absence of communication leads to 
opinions based on assumptions and gossip. Correcting these opinions takes more 
energy and time than it would have taken to distribute the correct information in the 
first place. 
 Project Document Updates 
 The specific project documents that may be updated as a result of the Plan 
Communications Management process are the stakeholder register and requirements 
documentation, scope statement, issue log, and  any  other relevant documents. 
 Quick Check 
 
 1. 
 What is the primary purpose of the communications 
management plan? 
 
 2. 
  If you are working in an organization with nine stakeholders, 
including yourself, how many potential communications 
channels are there? 
 
 3. 
  What is the significance of the kick-off meeting? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
  The main purpose of the communications management plan 
is to guide your actions in defining what communications 
the project is going to receive and send, how it will identify 
stakeholders communications requirements, and how 
information will be tracked and measured. 
 
 2. 
  If you have 9 stakeholders, including yourself, there are 36 
potential communications channels. 
 
 3. 
  The kick-off meeting is used to gather project team members 
and other relevant stakeholders together and communicate to 
them that enough planning has occurred for project execution 
to begin.

communication is an important consideration because each stakeholder will respond 
differently to the technology chosen. It is up to the project manager to ensure that the 
correct type of communication technology is selected to ensure that individual project 
communication requirements can be met. Remember that what works well for one 
stakeholder may not work for another stakeholder. 
 
REAL WORLD
 On a project I was managing, we generally disseminated project progress 
information by way of written and graphical reports. One senior manager continued 
to ask questions about information that was clearly contained in these reports. 
Answering these questions took time, so we gave this issue some thought. 
Ultimately we realized that instead of written reports, this person preferred brief 
face-to-face updates. So we initiated a regular process of “accidentally” stopping by 
this manager’s office and giving him a brief update.

 Communications Models 
 An awareness of how communications work, according to a basic communications 
model, is important for project managers to understand so they can avoid potential 
obstacles and difficulties  in  transmitting messages. A more thorough description of 
communications models was covered earlier in this chapter in the Plan Communications 
Management process. 
 Communications Methods 
 Your choice of push communications, pull communications, or interactive 
communications as a communications method depends on the stakeholder 
communications requirements. Communications methods were covered in more detail 
earlier in this chapter in the Plan  Communications Management process.  
 Information Management Systems 
 Information management systems are ways of managing and distributing your project 
information in hard copy and electronic form. Examples of hard copy distribution 
formats include press releases, memos, and project documents and plans. Increasingly, 
management  and  distribution of project information is handled by electronic means such 
as web sites, web publishing, and intranet portals. 
      Performance Reporting 
 Effective  performance reporting is a key element in ensuring that a project is successful 
and that stakeholder communication requirements are met. The way in which you 
collect and report performance information  should be in response to how individual 
stakeholders want to receive that information. All performance reports should be concise, 
succinct, and targeted at their intended audience. Performance reports may include 
simple text reports, or they may be more complex reports featuring a lot of narrative and 
descriptive text, diagrams, and tables. The content of a performance report can be on 
any relevant element and metric of the project. You may also choose to report certain 
elements such as cost and time to one group of stakeholders, while reporting aspects of 
quality to another group of stakeholders. 
 Outputs 
 The Manage Communications process produces some or all of the following outputs. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT
339
 Project Communications 
 Project communications are the  key output from the Manage Communications process. 
They can take many forms, based on the communications management plan. You 
may choose to send project communications in different formats, at different times 
and frequencies, and with different content, according to individual stakeholder 
communication requirements. Project communications go on to be used as an input into 
the Control Communications process. 
 Project Document Updates 
 The specific types of project documents that may be updated as a result of completing the 
Manage Communications process are issue logs,  stakeholder registers, project schedules, 
and budget.  
 Project Management Plan Updates 
 The specific part of the project management plan that may be updated as a result of 
the Manage Communications process is the communications management plan, along 
with any document affected by the  communications   management plan, such as the 
stakeholder management plan. Additionally, as a result of reporting project performance, 
parts of the scope management plan, time management plan, and quality management 
plan may be updated. 
 Organizational Process Asset Updates 
 The specific organizational process assets that may be updated as a result of this process 
include any generic project performance reports, templates,  stored  project records, and 
lessons learned documentation.

 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 The main purpose of the Manage Communications process 
is to gather project information and distribute and store it 
in accordance with the communications management plan, 
which will also reflect individual stakeholder communication 
requirements. 
 
 2. 
 When reporting project performance, your choice of format 
and content will be directly influenced by the intended 
audience and their communication needs. 
 
 3. 
 In the basic communication model, a message that is sent 
can encounter noise in the chosen medium. This noise could 
be actual audio sound, or it could be any other aspect that 
impedes, or interferes with, the message being sent.  
 Control Communications 
 
■ More Info   Control Communications 
 You can read more about the Control Communications process in the PMBOK Guide, 5th 
edition, in Chapter   10  , section 10.3. Table  8-4 identifies the process inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs.

 The Control Communications process is focused on monitoring and controlling 
project communications to ensure that they are in accordance with the communications 
management plan and individual stakeholder communication requirements. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT
341
 The Control Communications process covers the following monitoring and 
controlling domain  tasks  :
• 
  Task 1: Measure project performance using appropriate tools and 
techniques, in order to identify and quantify any variances and 
corrective actions. 
• 
  Task 5: Review the issue log, and update if necessary, and 
determine corrective actions by using appropriate tools and 
techniques, in order to minimize the impact on the project.  
• 
  Task 6: Capture, analyze, and manage lessons learned using 
lessons learned management techniques, in order to enable 
continuous improvement. 
 Inputs 
 The following inputs are used in the Control Communications process. 
 Project Management Plan 
 The  project management plan contains information about how each part of the project 
will be executed, monitored, and closed, and as such it provides a valuable input into 
any monitoring and controlling process. The specific part of the project management 
plan that is most useful for the Control Communications process is the communications 
management plan. The project management plan is an output from the Develop Project 
Management Plan process, and the communications management plan is an output from 
the Plan Communications Management process. 
 Project Communications 
 Project communications include all forms of communication about project progress, and 
also any communications that seek to generate political support from stakeholders for the 
project. As such,  project communications   can be in many forms and can contain different 
amounts and types of information. The most common forms of project communications 
relate to project performance reports about the most popular project metrics: cost, time, and 
quality. Project communications are an output from the Manage Communications process.  
 Issue Log 
 The issue log is a useful input into the Control Communications process because it 
documents and describes issues relating to communication. Additionally, the issue 
log provides information about who is responsible for resolving and monitoring the 
issue. Therefore, the issue log is useful both as a repository of project  issues   and as a 
communications tool that shows stakeholders that issues are being dealt with. The issue 
log is an output from the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process.  

CHAPTER 8 ■ COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT
342
 Work Performance Data 
 Work performance data is the raw information gathered about how well the project is 
doing in relation to cost, time, quality, and any other relevant metrics that are being 
measured. Work performance data is turned into work performance information in the 
 Control  Communications process, and this work performance information in turn is 
turned into work performance reports in the Monitor and Control Project Work process. 
Work performance data is an output from the Direct and Manage Project Work process. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Remember the sequence that work performance data becomes work 
performance information, which becomes work performance reports. 
 Organizational Process Assets 
 The specific organizational process assets that are of use in the Control Communications 
process are any templates, policies, and guidelines  for  project communications that the 
organization has. 
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques of this process can be used on the separate inputs to 
deliver the Control Communications process outputs. 
 Reporting Systems 
 A  reporting system  is any  method you choose to gather, store, and distribute or 
disseminate information. Reporting systems can be manual, although they are 
increasingly electronic and based on software. Reporting systems can be based on text or 
graphs and pictures. Whatever method you choose, it must be appropriate to the needs of 
you and  your  project team, as well as the stakeholders. 
 Expert Judgment 
 The use of  expert judgment  in monitoring and controlling communications is a valuable 
tool, because it makes available to you the experience, wisdom, and skills of groups or 
individuals on the project team or within the wider group of project stakeholders, or of 
external consultants or subject matter experts. It is often important to bring in people 
external to the project who can add a sense of objectivity to how well the communications 
on the project are being monitored and controlled, and how effective and appropriate 
they are. This is the real strength in using expert judgment as a tool in this process. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT
343
 Meetings 
 The Control Communications process is a monitoring and controlling process and, 
as such, requires careful attention. One of the better ways  of   giving it the attention it 
deserves is through the use of meetings as a tool, where the project team is able to discuss 
progress with project communications and make decisions about any improvements. 
Meetings are a form of communication themselves and so should always be run in an 
effective way to encourage attendance and involvement.   
 Outputs 
 The outputs from the Control Communications process are the following. 
 Work Performance Information 
 Work performance information is work performance data that has been organized and 
summarized in a way that can be used for work performance reports. Work performance 
information typically organizes raw data and reports on project status in relation to time 
and cost progress on the project. Work performance information is used as an input into 
the Monitor and  Control Project Work process. 
 Change Requests 
 As a result of carrying out any monitoring and controlling process, including the Control 
Communications process, you may come across variations between what you planned 
to do in the communications management plan and what is actually occurring. You may 
also have situations in which corrective or preventive actions are required to ensure that 
you stay on track. The best way to ensure that any variations or preventive or corrective 
actions are captured is through a change request. Change requests then go  on   to be 
processed according to your approved change-control process in the Perform Integrated 
Change Control process. 
 Project Management Plan Updates 
 As a result of monitoring and controlling project communications, you may choose to 
update parts of your project management plan to ensure that all of your planning efforts 
result in good communication and support your communication efforts.  
 Project Document Updates 
 The specific project documents that may be updated as a result of the Control 
Communications process include any issues logs, performance reports,  and  other 
relevant communications documents. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT
344
 Organizational Process Asset Updates 
 The specific  organizational process assets   that will be updated include any existing 
templates, guidelines, lessons learned, or historical databases relating to project 
communications management.

 2. 
 Why are reporting systems an important tool or technique in 
the Control Communications process? 
 
 3. 
 What is the relationship between work performance data, 
work performance information, and work performance 
reports? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 The main purpose of the Control Communications process is 
to assess whether project communications are being carried 
out as per the communications management plan and 
whether variations or corrective or preventive actions need to 
be taken to ensure that you stay on track. 
 
 2. 
 Reporting systems are the primary tool used in the Control 
Communications process because they are the manual 
or electronic means by which you choose to gather and 
distribute information about project progress to stakeholders. 
 
 3. 
 Work performance data is the raw data that is refined and 
becomes work performance information, which in turn is 
further refined to become work performance reports. 
 Chapter Summary 
• 
 The Communications Management knowledge area is focused 
on the successful use of project communications to report project 
performance, gain political support, and provide stakeholders 
with their communications requirements. 
• 
 The Plan Communications Management process produces 
the communications management plan, which guides the 
subsequent communications management processes. 
• 
 The Manage Communications process, which is an executing 
process, uses the communications management plan to gather, 
store, and distribute project information to stakeholders in the 
most effective way. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT
345
• 
  The Control Communications process, which is a monitoring 
and controlling process, is like other monitoring and controlling 
processes in that it assesses actual performance against that 
forecast in the communications management plan and, if 
variations or corrective or preventive actions are required, raises a 
change request.

 This question is asking you what the difference is between 7 
stakeholders and 13 stakeholders in relation to the number 
of potential communication channels. You need to calculate 
 n(n – 1)/2 for each and find the difference. The answer is not 
simply subtracting 7 from 13 and applying the formula to it—
that would give you a very wrong answer, but be aware that on 
the exam that answer may be one of the options. 
 For 7 stakeholders, you have 21 communication channels; 
and for 13 stakeholders, you have 78 communication 
channels. Therefore, the correct answer is the difference 
between these two numbers, which is 57 extra potential 
communication channels

 CHAPTER 9  
 Risk Management 
 This chapter focuses on the topic of Project Risk Management; like the other knowledge 
areas, it begins with a process of planning, which produces a risk management plan. It 
then has four further planning process—Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, 
Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, and Plan Risk Responses—that iteratively develop 
and refine the risk register. It has a single monitoring and controlling process, Control 
Risks, which measures the actual risks versus the forecast risks and, if required, generates 
change requests. 
 The PMBOK  ®   Guide Processes 
 Project Risk Management Knowledge Area 
 The six processes in the Project Risk Management knowledge area are as follows:
• 
  Plan Risk Management (planning process) 
• 
  Identify Risks (planning process) 
• 
  Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis (planning process) 
• 
  Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis (planning process) 
• 
  Plan Risk Responses (planning process) 
• 
  Control Risks (monitoring and controlling process) 
 What Is Project Risk Management? 
 Project Risk Management is focused on the processes of developing a risk management 
plan and a risk register that outlines and identifies how you will deal with project risks 
or uncertainties. In order to do this effectively, you need to be able to define all potential 
risks, their causes, and their potential impact, and formulate strategies for dealing with 
them. After they are identified, you then monitor what you had forecast would occur in 
relation to risk and what is actually occurring, while looking out for new or changed risks. 
 Figure  9-1 shows the general linear and highly iterative process of planning for risk 
and developing the risk register. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
354
 All projects experience some degree of risk throughout the project life cycle. How 
you choose to identity and respond to risk reflects the level of  risk tolerance that your 
project team or the wider organization has. If you have a low tolerance for risk, then you 
will either devote more time and energy to dealing with risks or choose not to undertake 
projects with high levels of risk. Conversely, if you have a high tolerance for risks, you will 
either devote less time to proactively planning for risks or choose to take on projects with 
high degrees of risk, perhaps seeking a high return. It is very important that the project 
manager spend time assessing the level of risk tolerance that key stakeholders such as 
your organization and the customer have, because this will affect how much time and 
effort goes into your risk management planning. 
 
■ Exam Tip   If you are familiar with ISO 31000 Standard for Risk Management, much of 
this section will be familiar to you. 
 Risk  is simply a measure of uncertainty that can affect the project either positively 
or negatively. For example, all the estimates you have done have some degree of 
uncertainty—either positive or negative—and this uncertainty represents risk that you 
need to account for and seek to manage. 
 
■ Exam Tip   If you are having trouble understanding exactly what risk management is all 
about, simply substitute the word  uncertainty for the word  risk . Risk management focuses 
on acknowledging that there is uncertainty throughout the entire project and on planning 
how to deal with that uncertainty. 
 If you come across a question on the exam that hints at any amount of uncertainty, you 
should assume that you must perform some level of risk identification and analysis. 
 Risk, or uncertainty, can be positive or negative. If a factor is a potential positive risk, 
then it is viewed as an opportunity to be maximized through proper selection of risk-
response strategies. If it is a negative risk, then it is a threat to the project, and your risk-
response strategies should seek ways to minimize it. Most people tend to think of risks 
as purely negative events, and although the majority of risks may indeed be potentially 
negative, there are many positive risks. For example, there can be a risk that you will 
deliver the project under budget by careful procurement of goods and services, in which 
case you should seek to ensure that you maximize the chances of this risk occurring. 
 Figure 9-1.  A sequential and iterative reprocess for risk management 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
355
 
REAL WORLD
 As a very general rule of thumb, I try to have about two-thirds of my project risk 
register focused on negative risks, or threats, and about one-third focused on 
positive risks, or opportunities. This is a very loose rule, and you may find that your 
projects differ depending on their industry, size, and complexity. The key point is to 
make sure you consider both negative and positive risks on your project.

 The Plan Risk Management process is a planning process with the risk management 
plan as its sole output. In order to develop a successful risk management plan, you first 
need to understand the general level of risk your project faces, as well as the project 
team’s or organization’s tolerance for risk. Because risk or uncertainty can occur in any 
part of the project, you need all the other management plans contained in the project 
management plan to ensure that you assess and consider all potential sources of risk. 
 The Plan Risk Management process covers the following planning domain task:
• 
 Task 10: Develop the risk management plan by identifying, 
analyzing, and prioritizing project risks, and defining risk 
response strategies, in order to manage uncertainty and 
opportunity throughout the project life cycle.     

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
356
 Inputs 
 The Plan Risk Management process uses some or all of the following inputs as part of the 
development of the risk management plan for the project. 
 Project Management Plan 
 The project management plan is useful as an input into the Plan Risk Management 
process because risk can occur at any point from any other aspect of the project. Thus, the 
already-developed subsidiary plans and baselines contained in the project management 
plan highlight areas of uncertainty that can be used to develop the risk management plan. 
The project management plan is an output from the Develop Project Management Plan 
process. 
 Project Charter 
 The project charter, depending on the form it takes, may contain initial descriptions 
and assessments of known or anticipated risks for the project that provide valuable 
information for the development of the risk management plan. The project charter is an 
output from the Develop Project Charter process. 
 Stakeholder Register 
 The stakeholder register identifies stakeholders in the project, records their roles and 
contact details, and documents their expectations, all of which are important in including 
stakeholders in the process of managing risk. The stakeholder register is an output from 
the Identify Stakeholders process. 
 Enterprise Environmental Factors 
 The specific enterprise environmental factor that is useful as an input into this process is 
the broader organizational tolerance for risk. Organizations with a low tolerance for risk 
put much more effort and energy into managing risk on a project, whereas organizations 
with a higher tolerance for risk and uncertainty expend less effort in managing risk and 
may take on higher-risk projects. International standards such as ISO 31000 may also affect 
how this process is carried out and, as such, constitute enterprise environmental factors.  
 Organizational Process Assets 
 The specific organizational process assets that may play an important input in the 
development of your risk management plan include any templates, processes, or 
guidelines that the organization has for the development of a risk management plan 
and managing risk. Other important organizational process assets are, of course, lessons 
learned and historical information about successful or unsuccessful risk identification 
and management from past projects. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
357
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques are available to be used to develop the inputs in this 
process in order to produce the risk management plan. 
 Analytical Techniques 
 The main purpose of analytical techniques is to determine the approach to risk 
management on your project. This involves checking with stakeholders about their 
particular appetite and attitude toward risk on the project, and also completing a high-
level assessment of risk exposure for the project. Typical analytical techniques are a 
 stakeholder risk profile analysis, which can be completed by interviewing individual 
stakeholders about their attitudes and expectations of risk that is suitable for the project. 
Strategic risk scoring sheets are also used to provide a high-level view of the types and 
level of risk the project will encounter. 
 Expert Judgment 
 Expert judgment is an excellent tool to use when planning your approach to risk 
management. Using the knowledge and experience of subject matter experts is invaluable 
not only in your overall risk management plan but also in identifying and completing 
an analysis of risks. Suitable experts who may provide judgment include senior 
management, stakeholders with relevant experience, and external subject matter experts 
such as risk professionals, industry groups, and professional associations. 
 
REAL WORLD
 If your project is likely to be subject to a high number of complex risks, you may 
want to consider employing the services of a risk management professional. Just as 
the profession of project management requires a particular skill set, the profession 
of risk management also employs a particular skill set. I highly recommend using 
risk management professionals for dealing with complex risk issues. 
 Meetings 
 Meetings are a great way to bring together project team members, stakeholders, and other 
experts in order to consider how risk will be managed on the project. There are a number 
of ways you can run these meetings in order to efficiently get the information you require. 
They can be run formally with defined agendas and examination of reports, or they can 
be run as creative brainstorming sessions. The style of meeting you choose will reflect the 
participants and your intended outcomes. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
358
 
REAL WORLD
 I have often found that meetings are a great way to not only solicit technical input 
from people with relevant experience but also generate buy-in and commitment. 
This is especially important in the area of risk management, because giving team 
members and relevant stakeholders the opportunity to contribute to the management 
of project risk helps keep them involved and also allows them to understand the 
importance of being proactive rather than reactive when managing risk.    
 Outputs 
 After applying the appropriate tools and techniques to the selected inputs, the Plan Risk 
Management process has the following output. 
 Risk Management Plan 
 The Plan Risk Management process has the  risk management plan as its sole output. 
Similar to other management plans, the risk management plan provides a guide for 
completing the project’s risk management activities. The risk management plan will 
probably contain information about the following:
• 
 The risk methodology and approach to be taken on the project.  
• 
 The individual roles and responsibilities within the team and the 
wider group of stakeholders. 
• 
 Any approved budgets for managing risk, which should then be 
included in the cost performance baseline. 
• 
 An initial analysis of the individual risk categories using a  risk 
breakdown structure (RBS). Figure  9-2 shows an example of a risk 
breakdown structure. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
359
 
■ Exam Tip   The RBS is one of four breakdown structures. The other three are the 
organizational breakdown structure, work breakdown structure, and resource breakdown 
structure. Each of the breakdown structures takes a high-level concept and breaks it down 
into its component parts. 
• 
  A standardized definition of risk probability and impact, which 
is particularly useful for qualitative analysis because the analysis 
can be subjective. Figure  9-3 shows an example of a standardized 
definition of risk probability and impact.   
 Figure 9-2.  The development of risk categories using a risk breakdown structure 
 Figure 9-3.  Standardized definitions of risk probability and impact 
 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
360
• 
 A probability and impact matrix is useful again for qualitative risk 
analysis, because it allows you to focus risk activities on positive 
or negative risks that present the greatest opportunity or threat. 
Figure  9-4 shows an example of a probability and impact matrix 
showing that the highest risks are any with a combined probability 
and impact greater than 45%; these are colored dark grey.  
• 
  Any predefined formats, processes, guidelines, or templates for 
risk registers or tracking or reporting risks. 
 The risk management plan is a subsidiary of the project management plan and is 
used as an input into the other five risk management processes.

 What is the main focus of the Plan Risk Management process? 
 
 2. 
 Why is it important to also consider positive risk? 
 
 3. 
 What other areas of the project management plan can risk 
affect? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
  The main focus of the Plan Risk Management Process is 
to formulate your particular approach to how you will 
manage risks on your project. This is documented in the risk 
management plan. 
 
 2. 
  Many people naturally consider risk a negative event; 
however, there are many positive risks, which can lead to a 
project being under budget, ahead of time, delivering greater 
quality, and delivering higher-than-expected stakeholder 
expectations. 
 
 3. 
 Risk management can affect every other aspect of the project, 
because there is generally always uncertainty in all elements 
of your project.

 The Identify Risks process is a planning process that uses a wide variety of inputs and 
tools and techniques to identify all the risks to the project. It is performed through the life 
of the project, and the risk register is always updated with newly identified risks or current 
risks that are reassessed by using the other risk planning processes. 
 The Identify Risks process covers the following planning domain task:
• 
 Task 10: Develop the risk management plan by identifying, 
analyzing, and prioritizing project risks, and defining risk 
response strategies, in order to manage uncertainty and 
opportunity throughout the project life cycle.    
 In addition to being performed throughout the life of the project, risk identification 
should be completed by all project team members and stakeholders with experience 
in the area. This enables you to draw on their skills and experience, and it also creates 
buy-in to the process of risk management. It is important to realize that the process of 
identifying risks is not a stand-alone process but one that involves many stakeholders in a 
constant state of communication to obtain their expertise and experience. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
362
 
REAL WORLD
 Despite your best efforts, you will probably miss certain risks. On a project I was 
working on, we spent a lot of time and money identifying risks for a particularly 
complex piece of work that was to occur over a five-day period. We used historical 
information, consulted experts, reviewed documents and plans, involved the project 
team members, and conducted tests to prepare what we thought was a completely 
comprehensive risk register. Within the first two hours of the five-day piece of work, 
a problem arose that we had not identified. We were able to respond to the situation 
well in this instance, and we used this information for a new risk register for a 
similar piece of work to be completed 12 months later. The main lesson we learned 
is that you need to be ready for the unexpected and not assume that your risk 
register captures every risk. 
 You should recognize from the range of inputs into the Identify Risks process that 
risk can occur in any other part of the project. 
 Inputs 
 The Identify Risks process uses some or all of the following inputs. 
 Risk Management Plan 
 The risk management plan is an essential input into the Identify Risks process because it 
contains information about your particular approach or methodology to identifying risks 
generally, and more specifically it contains information derived from the risk breakdown 
structure regarding already-identified risk categories. It also contains a description of the 
particular risk tolerance for the project, which will assist you in determining the effort you 
put into identifying particular risks. The risk management plan is an output from the Plan 
Risk Management process. 
 Cost Management Plan 
 The cost management plan contains cost estimates for all elements of the project, and 
these estimates should reflect the amount of uncertainty in the estimating process. Each 
of these areas of uncertainty, either negative or positive, represents a risk on the project. 
The cost management plan is an output from the Plan Cost Management process. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
363
 
■ Exam Tip   All estimates are by their very nature uncertain. They are educated guesses 
of what the future will be, based on information in hand today. As such, any baselines, such 
as cost and time, that are built up using estimates will have a range of uncertainty, both 
negative and positive. On the exam, if you find the word  uncertainty or  estimate , you should 
assume that risk is present. 
 Schedule Management Plan 
 The schedule management plan refers to areas of uncertainty or risk in the development 
of the project schedule. This information can be used to identify risks associated with the 
project time frame. The schedule management plan is an output from the Plan Schedule 
Management process. 
 Quality Management Plan 
 The quality management plan identifies areas of uncertainty in the delivery of quality 
on the project. The quality management plan is an output from the Plan Quality 
Management process. 
 Human Resource Management Plan 
 The human resource management plan identifies areas of uncertainty with the definition, 
recruitment, retention, and development of project team members, all of which represent 
risks for the project and should be taken into account during the Identify Risks process. 
The human resource management plan is an output from the Plan Human Resource 
Management process. 
 Scope Baseline 
 The scope baseline, made up of the scope statement, the work breakdown structure 
(WBS), and the WBS dictionary, defines the work to be done on the project and also 
outlines any areas of uncertainty in the project scope that require further definition. 
These areas of uncertainty represent risk for the project and should be used to identify 
individual risks related to the project scope. The scope baseline is an output from the 
Create WBS process. 
 Activity Cost Estimates 
 Individual activity cost estimates include cost estimates for individual project activities. 
In addition to the actual dollar amount of the estimate, there is information about the 
information used and assumptions made in preparing the estimates, which provides 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
364
insight into the range of uncertainty in the estimate. This uncertainty represents risk for 
the project and should be included in the development of the risk register. Activity cost 
estimates are an output from the Estimate Costs process.  
 Activity Duration Estimates 
 Activity duration estimates contain information about the individual time estimates 
prepared for project activities. This estimating information should contain an indication 
of the range of uncertainty surrounding the estimate, which represents risk to the project. 
Activity durations estimates are an output from the Estimate Activity Duration process.  
 Stakeholder Register 
 The stakeholder register is extremely useful in identifying individual risks for two reasons. 
First, the stakeholder register allows you to interview individual stakeholders about their 
particular attitude toward risk. Second, each stakeholder can assist with identifying 
project risks from their own unique point of view. The stakeholder register is an output 
from the Identify Stakeholders process. 
 Project Documents 
 The specific types of project documents that are useful in the Identify Risks process 
are things such as work performance reports, network diagrams, and assumption logs, 
because they provide information about how the project is performing, the sequence of 
planned activities, and the assumptions made about different estimates, respectively. 
 Procurement Documents 
 Procurement documents are a key input into the Identify Risks process because they 
outline any contractual obligations that may contribute to uncertainty, and the value 
of this uncertainty. Procurement documents are an output from the Plan Procurement 
Management process. 
 Enterprise Environmental Factors 
 The specific types of enterprise environmental factors that are useful in managing project 
risk are any broader organizational attitude and tolerance for risk, and any external risk 
standards the organization is using. 
 Organizational Process Assets 
 The specific types of organizational process assets that will assist in managing project risk 
are any blank templates, historical information and lessons learned, and any project-
specific policies and guidelines relating to risk management.   

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
365
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques are used on the inputs to deliver the Identify Risks 
process outputs. 
 Documentation Reviews 
 Documentation reviews refer to a structured analysis and review of all relevant project 
documents and the information they contain to detect any areas of uncertainty or risk 
on the project. The types of documents reviewed are any part of the project management 
plan or baselines, documents providing descriptions of any part of the project, and 
documents outlining the assumptions made in preparing estimates. Documentation 
reviews are generally carried out by the project manager and project team members. 
 Information-Gathering Techniques 
 There are many different ways to gather information in relation to project risk. Each has 
its own benefits and delivers a varying degree of accuracy and thoroughness. Examples 
of useful  information-gathering techniques for the Identify Risks process include the 
following:
• 
 Brainstorming: This is an excellent way to encourage creative 
thinking about particular risk issues. The intended outcome is a 
comprehensive list of all potential risks. 
• 
 Interviewing: Interviewing experts and people with experience 
in similar projects and the associated risks is an excellent way to 
quickly obtain relevant information. 
• 
 Delphi technique: This is an extremely useful tool to use to solicit 
information from experts anonymously, to avoid peer pressure 
and groupthink. This is particularly useful when you are seeking 
to encourage a wide range of opinions and assessments of 
potential project risks. 
 
REAL WORLD
 One of the few times I’ve been involved as a participant in a Delphi technique was 
in the identification of risks on a large, complex IT project. To me as a participant, 
it was a complex process requiring significant thought, input, and review of other 
anonymous participants’ opinions. After the results were gathered and disseminated 
to participants, though, I could see that there had been an extremely comprehensive 
identification and assessment of all the potential risks that could affect this 
particular project. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
366
 Checklist Analysis 
 Checklist analysis uses historical information gathered from previous projects and 
presents a list of activities and items that must be checked off to ensure that they have 
been done as part of a thorough risk identification process.  
 Assumption Analysis 
 Any and all assumptions made about any aspect of the project represent uncertainty 
and therefore risk for the project. Therefore, gathering the assumptions log and testing 
its accuracy, stability, consistency, and completeness are essential parts of identifying 
project risks. 
 Diagramming Techniques 
 The use of  diagramming techniques is an excellent way to graphically represent the 
process of identifying individual risks. Several diagramming techniques are particularly 
useful in the identification of risks. They include the cause-and-effect, Ishikawa, or 
fishbone diagram, which is extremely useful for getting to the root cause of project risks. 
You saw the use of this diagramming technique in Chapter   6 , to determine the root cause 
of quality issues. Figure  9-5 shows a cause-and-effect diagram being used to identify risks 
associated with cost overruns on a project. 
 Figure 9-5.  A cause-and-effect diagram for risk identification 
 Another useful diagramming technique is a flowchart, which can show how events 
are related to each other in a system. By analyzing how different activities or events are 
interrelated, you can recognize how risk can flow from one part of the project to another. 
 A third type of diagramming technique that is useful for the identification of risks 
is an influence diagram, which is a simple graphical representation of cause-and-effect 
relationships between sequential activities. 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
367
 SWOT Analysis 
 A key element of any risk identification process is the use of  SWOT analysis. SWOT stands 
for  strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats . The idea is to identify and document 
each of these four areas and then focus on your strengths while making provision for your 
weaknesses, prepare to take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves, and 
plan how to respond to identified threats. All of these are key elements in identifying risks. 
 
REAL WORLD
 I have successfully used SWOT analysis on many occasions to put a framework 
around a brainstorming session. Getting people to focus on current strengths, 
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats is an extremely easy way to start them 
thinking about uncertainty in the project. 
 Expert Judgment 
 The use of experts and their experience and skills in identifying risks is a key tool to 
be used during this process, because the identification of risks can be quite a complex 
process. By using the experience of project team members who may have done this sort 
of project before or external consultants with expertise in this particular area, you have a 
greater chance of identifying all the risks on the project.   
 Outputs 
 The Identify Risks process has the following single output. 
      Risk Register 
 The risk register is the single output from the Identify Risks process. The development 
of the risk register is highly iterative, and the risk register itself should be treated as a 
live document and reviewed regularly. It should be reviewed at all levels from testing 
the assumptions made right through to the qualitative and quantitative analysis applied 
to the identified risks. The actual risk register can take many forms depending on your 
organizational risk tolerance and any existing templates and guidelines. Figure  9-6 
shows a generic form of risk register indicating risk identification, qualitative analysis, 
quantitative analysis, and risk responses. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
368
 
REAL WORLD
 In addition to providing extremely valuable technical information about your 
assessment of risk on the project, the preparation and constant revisiting of the 
risk register keeps risk at the forefront of your project team’s minds. I have found 
time and effort invested in risk management to be useful not only from a technical 
point of view in managing risk, but also for obtaining buy-in and helping people to 
recognize the importance of proactive risk management. 
 
■ Exam Tip   The risk register is perhaps the most iterative document in the project, 
because it is constantly undergoing review and being updated. On the exam, you should 
always assume that the risk register is being referred to frequently. 
 Quick Check 
 
 1. 
 Why is the risk register considered a highly iterative 
document? 
 
 2. 
 Who should be involved in the identification of risks? 
 
 3. 
 What are three types of information-gathering techniques that 
can be used to identify risks? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 The risk register is a highly iterative document because you 
will always be updating it as information becomes available, 
assumptions made are tested and refined, and new risks are 
identified and old ones closed. 
 
 2. 
 The project manager will take ultimate responsibility for the 
Identify Risks process. But the entire project team and relevant 
external experts should also be involved in the process.

 Many types of information-gathering techniques are useful for 
many aspects of project management. Techniques specifically 
mentioned as useful for the Identify Risks process include 
brainstorming, the Delphi technique, interviewing, and root-
cause analysis.

 The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is a planning process focused on 
assigning a qualitative, or subjective, analysis of probability and impact to all identified risks. 
 The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process covers the following planning domain task:
• 
 Task 10: Develop the risk management plan by identifying, 
analyzing, and prioritizing project risks, and defining risk 
response strategies, in order to manage uncertainty and 
opportunity throughout the project life cycle.    
 
■ Exam Tip   The key difference between qualitative and quantitative assessment is that 
qualitative assessment is subjective—that is, it uses opinion and experience—and is done 
quickly. On the other hand, quantitative assessment involves actual data and figures to 
support a more objective assessment. For example, you may do a qualitative assessment 
that the chance of it snowing in winter during your construction project is 7 out of 10 (1 
being that it definitely will not snow, and 10 being that it definitely will snow) and that the 
impact if it does snow is 6 out of 10 (1 being no impact at all, and 10 being a catastrophic 
impact). This gives a total qualitative assessment of 42 out of a possible 100. You may then 
decide to spend some time and money doing quantitative risk analysis on this risk and 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
370
contact the local weather bureau, which tells you that there is a 0.831 chance of it snowing 
on those dates; in addition, your team members tell you that if it does snow, you will suffer 
a $10,000 loss. This gives you a total quantitative assessment of $8,310. You can see that 
quantitative assessment takes more time and money to get the information, but it is more 
accurate. 
 The process of qualitative risk analysis is generally done on all identified risks 
because it is quick and easy. It is simply a matter of assigning a subjective assessment 
of the probability of the risk occurring and also assigning a subjective assessment of the 
impact of the risk, using defined scales. The scales used can be numerical, such as 1–10, 
or text based, such as low, very low, high, and so on. 
 When these two factors are multiplied together, the result is an individual qualitative 
risk score for each identified risk, which you can use to prioritize the risks and choose to 
focus on those that rank the highest. Additionally, you will go on to perform quantitative 
risk analysis only on those risks that score the highest. 
 Inputs 
 The following inputs are used in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. 
 Risk Management Plan 
 Obviously one of the key inputs into any of the other risk management planning 
processes is the risk management plan because it contains information about how each 
risk management process, including the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process, will 
be performed. The risk management plan is an output from the Plan Risk Management 
process. 
 Scope Baseline 
 The scope baseline is an important input into the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis 
process because it describes all the work to be done and the work not to be done on the 
project. With this description of the work, you get a full picture of the elements of the 
scope that are clear and defined, along with those elements of the scope that are still 
uncertain and ill-defined and that represent risk on the project that needs to be analyzed. 
The scope baseline is an output from the Create WBS process.  
 Risk Register 
 The risk register is a key input into the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process because, 
in its first iteration, it is a list of all the risks that have been identified. The continual 
development of the risk register includes qualitative risk analysis performed not only 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
371
once, but on an ongoing basis as new information, new risks, and assumptions are 
refined. The risk register is an output from the Identify Risks process. 
 Enterprise Environmental Factors 
 The specific types of enterprise environmental factors that are useful as inputs into the 
Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process are any external industry standards, such as 
ISO 31000, and any external information held by risk professionals, such as risk databases 
and information about the analysis of individual risks.  
 Organizational Process Assets 
 The specific organizational process assets that are of use in the Perform Qualitative Risk 
Analysis process are any historical information the organization has about similar risks 
and their probability and impact, and any pre-prepared templates and processes to assist 
in the qualitative analysis of individually identified risks.   
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques of this process can be used on the separate inputs to 
deliver the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process outputs. 
 Risk Probability and Impact Assessment 
 The primary tool used in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is  risk probability 
and impact assessment . The key here is to assess each identified risk and assign to it a 
probability of the risk occurring and an assessment of the impact if the risk does occur, by 
using a standardized scale that should be included in the risk management plan. Because 
it is a qualitative analysis, several kinds of numerical scales or text descriptions can be 
used to standardize the responses assessing probability and impact. 
 Because the assessments of probability and impact being made are qualitative 
and therefore somewhat subjective, it is important during this process to document 
assumptions that are made based on the information available at the time the assessment 
is done. Throughout the course of the project, you will revisit these assumptions, and you 
will gain further information, which may change either the assessment of risk probability 
or its impact. 
 
REAL WORLD
 There are many different ways to assess qualitative probability and impact on 
projects. In my career, I have used simple numerical scales from 1 to 5, and text-
based descriptions such as likely, unlikely, and highly likely. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
372
 Probability and Impact Matrix 
 A  probability and impact matrix standardizes and identifies risks after they have had 
a probability and impact assessment performed on them so that individual risks can 
be ranked very quickly. Figure  9-4 , shown earlier in this chapter in the “Plan Risk 
Management” section, presented an example of a probability and impact matrix as a key 
component of the risk management plan. 
 Risk Data Quality Assessment 
 A key element when performing any sort of risk assessment is the quality of the 
information being used. Obviously, if poor-quality information is being used, your 
subsequent assessment will be poor. Therefore, it is important to use a  risk data 
quality assessment technique to evaluate the quality of the data being used to make the 
assessment. 
 
REAL WORLD
 In my experience, the quality of information that you use to identify and analyze risks 
definitely gets better over time, especially if you are doing particular types of work 
for the first time and you are constantly learning and refining the information you 
have on hand. 
 Risk Categorization 
 A useful way of representing and presenting the qualitative risk analysis is with  risk 
categorization techniques, which you can use to sort risks into categories for easy 
monitoring and reporting. An excellent example of risk categorization is the risk 
breakdown structure (RBS) shown earlier, in Figure  9-2 . You may also choose to 
categorize risks by project phase or by relevance to particular stakeholders. However 
you choose to categorize risks, you should be able to present them in a document or 
graphically. 
 Risk Urgency Assessment 
 A  risk urgency assessment is a tool that takes into account not only an assessment of the 
probability and impact of the risk, but the urgency of the risk. Urgency has to do with 
whether the risk is likely to occur in the near future, in which case you have a high degree 
of urgency compared to risks that may not manifest until a later point in time. Risks that 
may occur in the near future need the greatest attention paid to them. Risks that may 
occur further off in the project timeframe can have less attention paid to them.  

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
373
 Expert Judgment 
 Again, the use of expert judgment is an exceptionally good way to bring a robust level of 
analysis to your Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Your choice of experts, and the 
way in which you choose to solicit information from them, will be an important factor in 
the quality of the advice given. 
 
REAL WORLD
 It is always important to give a high degree of consideration when selecting people 
to consult with as experts. The types of things you may want to consider are their 
level of experience, willingness to share this experience, availability, and ability to 
share information concisely, and any costs associated with the use of those experts. 
 Outputs 
 The sole output from the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is the following. 
 Project Document Updates 
 The specific project documents that will be updated are the risk register and the 
assumptions log. Any time you complete any new qualitative risk assessments or revise 
existing qualitative risk assessments based on refined or new information, you need 
to update the risk register. In addition to updating the risk register with new or revised 
information, you must update the assumptions log to reflect the new assumptions that 
have been made.

 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 The main difference between qualitative risk assessment 
and quantitative risk assessment is that qualitative risk 
assessment uses subjective assessments of probability and 
impact, whereas quantitative risk assessment uses objective 
assessments of probability and impact, usually quantifying 
them in terms of money or time.

 2. 
 There is no one best type of probability and impact 
assessment to use in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis 
process. The decision whether to use numerical scales or text-
based descriptions of qualitative risk analysis is entirely up to 
you and depends on what is appropriate for your project.  
 
 3. 
 Risk urgency assessment takes into account the timeframe 
in which the risk may manifest, with risks that may manifest 
in the near future having a higher urgency than risks that 
may occur in the longer term. Risk probability and impact 
assessment is applied to all risk and simply assesses the 
probability of the risk occurring and the impact if it does 
occur.

 The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is a planning process focused on the 
development of a quantitative, or objective, assessment of individual risk probability and 
impact, often by using a metric based on money or time. 
 The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process covers the following planning 
domain task:
• 
 Task 10: Develop the risk management plan by identifying, 
analyzing, and prioritizing project risks, and defining risk 
response strategies, in order to manage uncertainty and 
opportunity throughout the project life cycle.    

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
375
 Performing quantitative risk analysis generally takes more effort than performing 
qualitative risk analysis and assessment, and therefore it is generally performed on risks 
that are identified as having a higher probability and impact on the project. The intended 
outcome of the quantitative risk assessment process is to assign a dollar or time amount 
to specific risks if they occur. You can then aggregate all these individual quantitative 
estimates to build contingency reserves for time or cost. Because of the complexity of the 
tools and techniques and information required for successful quantitative risk analysis, it 
is often done by risk professionals who have experience and access to relevant historical 
information that can be used in the analysis. 
 Inputs 
 The following inputs are used in the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. 
 Risk Management Plan 
 The risk management plan outlines the particular way in which you will approach the 
process of quantitative risk analysis and, as such, it is an extremely important input to 
assist in the completion of this process. The risk management plan is an output from the 
Plan Risk Management process. 
 Cost Management Plan 
 The cost management plan is a useful input into the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis 
process because it outlines how financial reserves will be developed and managed. 
One of the key metrics used in quantitative risk analysis is the use of dollar amounts; 
cumulatively, the individual dollar amounts can be added up to become a cost reserve 
for the project. The cost management plan is an output from the Plan Cost Management 
process. 
 Schedule Management Plan 
 Like the cost management plan, the schedule management plan provides guidelines 
for the development and management of a schedule reserve, which is calculated with 
quantitative risk analysis by using time as a metric. The schedule management plan is an 
output from the Plan Schedule Management process. 
 Risk Register 
 The risk register, from the moment it first appears and throughout its subsequent 
iterations, is an essential input into the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process 
because the outputs from this process update the risk register with specific information 
about individual risk assessment. The risk register is an output from the Identify Risks 
process. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
376
 Enterprise Environmental Factors 
 The specific enterprise environmental factors that are useful in the Perform Quantitative 
Risk Analysis process are any external industry standards such as ISO 31000 and any risk 
databases held by risk professionals. 
 Organizational Process Assets 
 The specific organizational process assets that are of use in the Perform Quantitative Risk 
Analysis process are any historical information the organization has regarding previous 
experience with performing quantitative risk analysis and, of course, any blank templates 
or guidelines the organization has for completing the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis 
process. 
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques of this process can be used on the separate inputs to 
deliver the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process outputs. 
      Data Gathering and Representation Techniques 
 A key technique to assist with the execution of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis 
process is the use of  data gathering and representation techniques . The purpose of using 
these techniques is to obtain relevant and accurate data that can then be assessed to 
develop the quantitative metrics of risk probability and impact. These data gathering and 
representation techniques include the following:
• 
 Interviewing techniques that draw on the experience and skills 
of experts. The type of information that you seek from experts is 
their own quantitative assessment of probability and impact of 
particular risks. You may end up with a range of responses and 
thus may want to consider the use of three-point estimating, 
which was covered in the cost and time estimating processes in 
Chapter   4  and Chapter   5 . 
• 
 Established statistical probability distributions . There are many 
types of probability distributions, but the most commonly 
used are normal distributions, beta distributions, triangular 
distributions, and uniform distributions, each with its own 
statistical distribution of data that can be used to quantify a 
particular risk probability or impact and the associated range 
of data. The type of distribution you use should be based on 
professional experience and historical information, in order to 
make sure it is valid. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
377
 Quantitative Risk Analysis and Modeling Techniques 
 In  quantitative risk analysis and modeling techniques,  sophisticated statistical and 
mathematical approaches are applied to the calculation and range of risk probability and 
impact. A variety of techniques can be used, but because of their sophistication, they are 
usually carried out using software. Of the available types of quantitative risk analysis and 
modeling techniques, the following are the most popular and useful for quantitative risk 
analysis:
• 
 Sensitivity analysis: A technique that looks at different aspects 
of the project and how they have an impact on project risk, to 
determine which parts of the project are most sensitive to risk. 
It may, for example, determine that issues around cost are more 
sensitive to risk and, more specifically, that cost issues related 
to inflationary pressures on materials over time are most at risk. 
Sensitivity analysis is a highly complex set of calculations using 
software and, as such, generally requires specialized knowledge 
and expertise to carry out. 
• 
 Tornado diagrams: Often used to present the results of sensitivity 
analysis. A tornado diagram is a histogram or bar chart where the 
data categories are listed vertically instead of horizontally, with 
the largest category at the top and the other categories in order of 
descending size, giving the diagram the appearance of a tornado. 
Figure  9-7 shows an example of a tornado diagram presenting the 
results of sensitivity analysis to show which parts of the project 
are most sensitive to risk, judged by the quantitative impact they 
will have on the net present value (NPV) of the project. 
 Figure 9-7.  A example of tornado diagram showing how different risks may impact the 
project’s net present value 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
378
• 
 Expected monetary value analysis (EMV): A way to allocate 
quantitative numerical probability and impact to particular 
options and from this to arrive at the expected monetary value of 
each option. Depending on the calculated outcome, you can then 
quantify your decision. The usual way of graphically representing 
the EMV analysis is with the use of decision trees. In Figure  9-8 , 
a decision tree shows the calculation of EMV regarding whether 
to upgrade existing customer ordering software or to develop a 
completely new piece of software. 
 Figure 9-8.  A decision tree analysis for assessing the expected monetary value of building 
new software or upgrading existing software 
 Figure  9-8  shows that for either decision, there is an 80% chance of high customer 
use and a 20% chance of low customer use. If you decide to build new software, it will 
cost $50 million, and if there is high customer use, you will make $100 million, so there is 
an 80% chance of making a net figure of $50 million. By the same token, if you decide to 
build new software at a cost of $50 million, and there is low customer use, you will only 
make $60 million, so there is a 20% chance of making a net figure of $10 million. You then 
add these two calculations together

 to get an EMV of $42 million. 
 The other option is to upgrade the existing software, which will cost $30 million and 
has an 80% chance of making a net figure of $30 million and a 20% chance of making a net 
figure of $5 million. Therefore, the EMV for this decision is

 By using this form of quantitative risk analysis, you can recognize that the best 
decision is to take the option with the greater EMV, which is to build new software. What 
is also apparent in this example is that the quality of the calculated outcome is only as 
good as the quality of the information going into the model. This is another example of 
why it is important to document the assumptions you make, so that if any of this changes 
in the future, you can quickly recalculate. 
 
■ Exam Tip   You may have to calculate a decision tree on the exam, so remember to 
calculate the probability of each by the net value—cost minus income. 
• 
 Modeling and simulation: Includes Monte Carlo analysis, which 
is the most common type. In the Monte Carlo technique, all 
potential outcomes are modeled and computed many times, with 
different input values, to assess the most likely outcomes—that 
is, those with the highest probability—and to come up with a 
probability distribution (normal, uniform, or beta) associated 
with each of these outcomes. By using Monte Carlo analysis, you 
can find the likely probability of many different risks, and this 
allows you and your team to determine which risks will have the 
greatest or least chance of occurring. It is a highly sophisticated 
form of mathematical modeling and requires the use of software. 
 
■ Exam Tip   If a question on the exam refers to mathematical modeling of risks, it is 
referring to one of these techniques. 
 Expert Judgment 
 Given the complexity of performing accurate quantitative risk analysis, the use of subject 
matter experts with relevant experience in this area is very important. Expert judgment is 
important not only for the quantitative calculations but also for the interpretation of the 
data produced.

 The Plan Risk Responses process is a planning process that is focused on the 
development of proactive responses to risks. 
 The Plan Risk Responses process covers the following planning domain task:
• 
 Task 10: Develop the risk management plan by identifying, 
analyzing, and prioritizing project risks, and defining risk 
response strategies, in order to manage uncertainty and 
opportunity throughout the project life cycle.    
 The development of proactive responses is a very effective way of both minimizing 
the potential effects of negative risk and maximizing the potential benefits of positive 
risk on a project. Each of the risk responses seeks to influence the risk prior to its 
possible occurrence and also to influence the risk if it does occur. In addition to planning 
responses to identified risk, the Plan Risk Responses process proactively considers 
responses to unplanned or unforeseen risks. 
 Inputs 
 The following inputs are used in the Plan Risk Responses process. 
 Risk Management Plan 
 The risk management plan contains information about the processes you have decided 
are most appropriate for the development of risk responses; as such, it is an essential 
input into the Plan Risk Responses process. The risk management plan is an output from 
the Plan Risk Management process. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
382
 Risk Register 
 Obviously, in order to develop risk responses, you need a list of all the identified risks, 
their potential consequences, and either the qualitative or quantitative risk analysis for 
each. All this information is contained in the risk register, which makes it an essential 
input into the Plan Risk Responses process. The risk register is an output from the Identify 
Risks process. 
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques of this process can be used on the separate inputs to 
deliver the Plan Risk Responses process output. 
 Strategies for Dealing with Negative Risks or Threats 
 There are four key strategies for dealing with negative risks or threats in relation to the 
development of appropriate risk responses:
• 
 Avoid:  Make plans to avoid the risk occurring. For example, if 
you have identified that there is a risk of earthquake damage in a 
building you plan to construct, an avoid strategy is to relocate the 
building to an area that is more geologically stable. 
• 
 Transfer: Assign someone else the responsibility and ultimately 
the consequences of the risk. The most common form of transfer 
is insurance. For example, after identifying that your building may 
be subject to damage from an earthquake, you may decide to take 
out insurance for this event. 
• 
 Mitigate:  Accept that the risk may occur, but attempt to put 
in place a risk response that minimizes the negative effects of 
the risk. For example, you may decide to build your multistory 
building in a known earthquake zone but choose to mitigate the 
effects of an earthquake on the building by using base isolators 
and materials that are impact resistant. 
• 
 Accept: Simply accept the consequence of the risk occurring. 
For example, you may choose not to take out insurance, shift 
a planned building, or use earthquake-resistant building 
technology, and simply accept that if an earthquake hits, you will 
take responsibility for repairs. 
 You can have multiple strategies for each risk; often this is the wisest approach 
because different strategies can be enacted at different points on the timeline of a 
risk potentially occurring. You will also choose the most appropriate risk strategy, or 
strategies, for your particular risk and your particular risk tolerance. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
383
 Strategies for Dealing with Positive Risks or Opportunities 
 Four key  strategies for dealing with positive risks or opportunities seek to maximize the 
chance of a positive risk occurring and if it does occur, to maximize the positive impact on 
the project:
• 
 Exploit: Seek to ensure that the positive risk has the maximum 
chance of occurring. For example, you may decide to allocate 
your top designers to a particular client’s project to ensure that 
the positive risk of a happy client is enhanced. 
• 
 Share: Take on board a third party with particular skills and 
experience to help maximize the occurrence and the impact of 
a positive risk. For example, you may choose to go into a joint 
venture with a company with complementary skills in order to 
increase the chances of securing a particular contract. 
• 
 Enhance: Be prepared to increase the chances of the positive risk 
occurring and, if it does occur, its positive impact. For example, 
you may choose to buy more lottery tickets in order to enhance 
the chances of your winning. 
• 
 Accept: Make no changes to the project management plan, and 
simply accept the chances of the positive risk occurring and the 
impact it will have. 
 Contingent Response Strategies 
 Each of the strategies for dealing with negative risk or positive risk discussed previously 
is developed for clearly identified risks. However, despite your best efforts, you are highly 
unlikely to identify all the risks that may occur on a project; thus it is prudent to have in 
place  contingent response strategies, which are planned responses to unplanned risk. The 
contingent response strategies outline the actions your project team will take if a set of 
predefined conditions occurs. This set of predefined conditions can refer to particular 
metrics relating to the project budget or project schedule. Your contingent response 
strategies are included in your  contingency plan . 
 A further means of dealing with unplanned risks occurring is a  workaround . 
The difference between a workaround and contingent response strategies is that a 
workaround is an unplanned and reactive response to an unplanned risk occurring, 
whereas a contingent response strategy is a planned and prepared response to an 
unplanned risk occurring. A workaround is a plan to get around a problem or risk that 
has arisen and not necessarily fix it. A great way to implement a workaround is to gather 
experienced people in a single location and get them to brainstorm a solution as fast as 
possible. The workaround may be a temporary solution to allow you to continue working 
on the project; therefore, you should be prepared to revisit the situation with a more 
permanent solution. Always include your experience with workarounds in your lessons 
learned so that future projects may anticipate the risk and include it in their risk register. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
384
 Expert Judgment 
 Given the complexity of executing a well-defined series of planned risk responses, it is 
prudent to use expert judgment as a tool in developing your risk responses. The experts 
you choose to use will be people with experience and skills in anticipating and dealing 
with the identified risks. 
 Outputs 
 The outputs from the Plan Risk Responses process are the following. 
 Project Management Plan Updates 
 The specific parts of the project management plan that will be updated as a result of 
your consideration of potential risk responses will include all aspects of the project 
management plan, such as the schedule, cost, quality, and procurement management 
plans, as well as the human resource management plan and scope, schedule, and cost 
baselines. The consideration of different and appropriate risk responses often requires 
you to revisit these foundational documents as a result of the risks identified and the 
planned responses. 
      Project Document Updates 
 The specific project documents that will be updated will of course be the risk register and 
the assumptions log. It is essential that both of these documents are kept up to date and 
reflect the latest information about particular risks, the analysis of individual risks, and 
the planned risk responses.

 The Control Risks process is focused on monitoring and controlling the project risk 
management activities being undertaken to ensure that they are in accordance with the 
risk management plan and the information contained in the risk register. 
 The Control Risks process covers the following monitoring and controlling 
domain task:
• 
 Task 4: Monitor and assess risk by determining whether 
exposure has changed and evaluating the effectiveness of 
response strategies, in order to manage the impact of risks and 
opportunities on the project. 
 Like all the other monitoring and controlling processes, the Control Risks process 
checks the implementation of the plan. In this case, you are checking what is occurring 
against what you planned to occur in relation to risk management. You will be looking out 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
386
for any variance between the risks you planned for and the risks that are occurring, any 
new risks, and any new information affecting already-identified risks, and evaluating the 
overall risk process. 
 Inputs 
 The following inputs are used in the Control Risks process. 
 Project Management Plan 
 The project management plan contains information about how each part of the project 
will be executed, monitored, and closed, in relation to risk. The specific part of the project 
management plan that is most useful for the Control Risk process is the risk management 
plan. The project management plan is an output from the Develop Project Management 
Plan process, and the risk management plan is an output from the Plan Risk Management 
process. 
 Risk Register 
 The risk register is the key document in this process, because you are checking the 
information contained in the risk register against what is actually occurring. You are 
checking that you identified all the risks; that you correctly estimated their consequences, 
probability, and impact; and that your documented responses were appropriate. You are 
also using the risk register to check for any risks you may have missed. The risk register is 
an output from the Identify Risks process. 
 Work Performance Data 
 In order to assess how you are doing against what you had planned to do, you require 
work performance data. Work performance data will in turn become work performance 
reports in the Monitor and Control Project Work process. Work performance data is an 
output from the Direct and Manage Project Work process. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Remember the sequence that work performance data becomes work 
performance information, which becomes work performance reports. 
 Work Performance Reports 
 Work performance reports are the result of analyzing the work performance information 
and presenting it in a coherent and easy-to-understand manner in order to give 
you a comprehensive picture of how well, or how poorly, the project is doing. Work 
performance reports are an output from the Monitor and Control Project Work process. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
387
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques of this process can be used on the separate inputs to 
deliver the Control Risks process outputs. 
 Risk Reassessment 
 Risk reassessment  is an ongoing process of checking whether there are new risks, whether 
already-identified risks are still current, whether the analysis of their probability and 
impact is still accurate, and whether the planned risk responses are still appropriate. The 
contents of the risk register are highly fluid and subject to a high degree of change as the 
project progresses and more information is known about existing risks. Thus you should 
treat the risk register as a live document in constant need of checking and reassessment. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Risk reassessment should be viewed as a continual activity led by the project 
manager and involving the project team. 
 Risk Audits 
 Generally, audits are a great way to check that processes are working as planned and 
whether there is any room for improvement. In the Control Risks process,  risk audits 
are used to check whether the planned risk responses are appropriate, how well the 
risk management processes are being implemented, and whether they are appropriate. 
It is the project manager’s responsibility to ensure that risk audits are carried out at 
appropriate times and with defined objectives. The results of the risk audit contribute to 
the ongoing continuous improvement of your project processes. 
 Variance and Trend Analysis 
 Variance and trend analysis is used in other areas as a technique to identify and 
document what is occurring against what was planned and then extrapolate from that 
any identifiable trends that may indicate future performance. When it is used in the 
Control Risks process, you are looking for any divergence from the risk management 
plan and risk register and examining this to determine whether it indicates any trends 
that you can proactively plan for. For example, you may spot that you have consistently 
underestimated the magnitude of risks around costs of a certain material and use 
variance and trend analysis to reforecast the future impact and probability of these risks.  
 Technical Performance Measurement 
 Technical performance measurement means putting in place acceptable parameters 
around potentially negative risk events—generally those affecting scope, time, and cost—
and then checking that the work being performed is within these technical performance 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
388
measurements. Work being performed outside the defined technical performance 
measurements represents risk on the project and may require change requests to be 
prepared and considered, to change parameters if the planed risk response cannot bring 
performance back into line. For example, you may have set a range of acceptable costs for 
development of a new product, but when measuring the actual costs, you find them to be 
greater than planned; therefore, the risk of a cost overrun on the project is greater. 
 Reserve Analysis 
 During the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process, you used objective measurements 
to develop contingency reserves for either cost or time. During the Control Risks process, 
you check whether these calculations are still accurate and the reserves you have planned 
for are still appropriate. It may be that new information has come to light that means the 
reserve for either cost or time needs to be changed. As a project progresses and estimates 
become more accurate, it is typical for the range of contingency calculated by using 
qualitative risk analysis to decrease. For example, you may find that extra information 
gained about an estimate for the range of time taken to perform a certain activity means 
the estimate can be refined and reduced, because you have performed the activity several 
times. You can then reduce the time reserve allocated to this activity.  
 Status Meetings 
 You should either make risk management a normal part of regular project meetings or 
schedule meetings with a special focus on risk management to ensure that you and the 
team remain focused on risk management activities throughout the life of the project. 
The purpose of these  status meetings is to examine all aspects of risk management 
on the project and ensure that they are still appropriate and effective. Additionally, 
having regular meetings where risk management is a topic of discussion creates 
greater awareness and buy-in from team members, which in turn results in better risk 
management. 
 Outputs 
 The outputs from the Control Risks process include the following. 
 Work Performance Information 
 As a result of carrying out the Control Risks process, you will end up with valuable work 
performance information about risk management activities. This information will take 
the form of revised information about risk responses and their effectiveness, the use of 
planned time and cost contingency reserves, and any defined technical performance 
measurements. Work performance information is used as an input into the Monitor and 
Control Project Work process. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
389
 Change Requests 
 As a result of completing the Control Risks process and conducting risk audits, variance 
and trend analysis, technical performance measurements, or reserve analysis, you may 
discover information that requires a formal change to be made to a part of the project; this 
is done via a change request. Change requests then go on to be processed according to 
your approved change-control process in the Perform Integrated Change Control process.  
 Project Management Plan Updates 
 Because risk management affects all other areas of the project, you may update many 
different parts of the project management plan and its baselines. You will most definitely 
update the risk management plan. 
 Project Document Updates 
 The specific project documents that will be updated include the risk register and the 
assumptions log. 
 Organizational Process Asset Updates 
 The specific organizational process assets that will be updated include any historical 
information about risk management and any templates, processes, or guidelines the 
organization has in relation to project management.

 2. 
 Why is risk reassessment an important tool or technique in 
the Control Risks process? 
 
 3. 
  How does the Control Risks process contribute to the 
development of contingency reserves for time and cost? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
  The main purpose of the Control Risks process is to determine 
whether the risk management activities as planned in the 
risk management plan are being completed as per the plan, 
whether the risks identified in the risk register are manifesting 
as forecast, and whether the qualitative and quantitative 
assessments and planned risk responses are still appropriate.  
 
 2. 
  In addition to checking whether risk management activities 
are being completed as per the plan, a key element of the 
Control Risks process is a complete reassessment of the 
assumptions made, the risks identified, and whether any new 
risks have been identified. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT

 3. 
 The Control Risks process allows you to examine the time 
and cost contingency reserves you have developed; as part 
of the reassessment of risks, you may choose to redefine the 
reserves allowed for time and cost. Usually this process results 
in a reduction in the reserves for both time and cost. As more 
information is known, the better the estimate is, and less risk 
or uncertainty is associated with time and cost. 
 Chapter Summary 
• 
 The Risk Management knowledge area is focused on the 
successful use of project risk to report project performance, 
gain political support, and provide stakeholders with their risk 
requirements. 
• 
 The Plan Risk Management process produces the risk 
management plan, which guides the subsequent risk 
management processes. 
• 
 The Identify Risks process, which is a planning process, uses the 
risk management plan to begin the iterative process of developing 
the risk register by using a variety of tools and techniques to 
identify all potential negative and positive risks.  
• 
 The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is a planning 
process that seeks to assign a subjective probability and impact 
assessment to each of the identified risks so that they can be 
prioritized. 
• 
 The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is a planning 
process that assigns a quantitative and objective analysis, usually 
based on statistics and factual data, to the individual probability 
and impact of identified risks, which can lead to the creation of 
contingency reserves for time and cost. 
• 
 The Plan Risk Responses process is a planning process that 
outlines a proactive response to all identified risks on the project. 
• 
 The Control Risks process, which is a monitoring and controlling 
process, is like other monitoring and controlling processes in 
that it assesses actual performance against that forecast in the 
risk management plan, checks whether the risks identified and 
assessed in the risk register are still accurate, and checks whether 
there are any new risks.

low nor high, high, or very high. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ RISK MANAGEMENT
392
 
 B. 
  You pay the local meteorological bureau to provide 
you with the exact probability of there being a storm in

low probability or impact, up to 0.9, meaning very high 
probability and impact. You then multiply these two 
numbers together to obtain a risk score. 
 
 D.  The quantity surveyor working for your cost-estimating 
team has calculated that over the next two years of your 
project, there is a risk of a 10.3% increase in hardware 
costs, and that this increase could cost you a total of 
$173,000. The surveyor recommends purchasing this 
hardware now and finding a place to store it to avoid this 
risk. 
 
 E. 
  You have calculated that there is a very high chance that 
a senior staff member will leave your project within the

 Answer: This is an example of qualitative risk analysis 
because it is using subjective assessment and opinion on 
a fixed scale. 
 
 B. 
  You pay the local meteorological bureau to provide 
you with the exact probability of there being a storm in 
April of a magnitude that would affect your construction 
project. 
 Answer: This is an example of quantitative risk analysis 
because you are using actual statistical data instead of 
subjective opinion to calculate probability.  
 
 C. 
 You gather a team of seven subject matter experts and 
ask them to provide their opinion of probability and 
impact of the risk of the selected technology on your 
IT project. You ask them to select from a standardized 
scale of probabilities ranging from 0.1, meaning very 
low probability or impact, up to 0.9, meaning very high 
probability and impact. You then multiply these two 
numbers together to obtain a risk score. 
 Answer: This is an example of qualitative risk analysis, 
because, despite the use of experts using numbers with 
decimal points in them, it is still an opinion-based 
assessment on a fixed, predetermined scale. 
 
 D.  The quantity surveyor working for your cost estimating 
team has calculated that over the next two years of your 
project there is a risk of a 10.3% increase in hardware 
costs, and that this increase could cost you a total of 
$173,000. The surveyor recommends purchasing this 
hardware now and finding a place to store it to avoid this 
risk. 
 Answer: This is an example of quantitative risk analysis 
because it uses clear, calculated numbers based on facts 
to determine probability and impact. 
 
 E. 
  You have calculated that there is a very high chance that 
a senior staff member will leave your project within the 
next three months, and that replacing them will cost 
$25,000. You decide to offer a salary increase of $15,000 to 
get them to stay with the project.

 CHAPTER 10  
 Procurement Management 
 This chapter focuses on the topic of Project Procurement Management; like the other 
knowledge areas, it begins with a process of planning, which in this case produces a 
procurement management plan. It then uses this plan to carry out the procurement work, 
which involves making decisions about whether to procure goods, services, or resources 
from external sources and, if so, how to advertise and award the contract, and what form 
of contract to use. Procurement management also involves monitoring contractual terms 
for performance and includes a process for making sure all contracts are formally closed. 
 The PMBOK ®   Guide processes 
 Project Procurement Management  knowledge area 
 The four processes in the Project Procurement Management knowledge area are as 
follows:
• 
  Plan Procurement Management (planning process) 
• 
  Conduct Procurements (executing process) 
• 
  Control Procurements (monitoring and controlling process) 
• 
 Close Procurements (closing process) 
 What Is Project Procurement Management? 
 
■ Exam Tip   If you are familiar with the ISO 31000 Standard for Procurement 
Management, much of this section will be familiar to you. Additionally, much of this topic is 
based on formal government procurement processes. 
 Project procurement management is focused on planning for and making decisions 
about whether to procure goods and services needed on the project from external 
sources, which form of contact to choose, how to select sellers to deliver the work, and 
how to check that the work is being done in accordance with the agreed contracts. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
406
 The Plan Procurement Management process results in a procurement management 
plan, which guides the other procurement management processes. The organization 
looking to procure goods or services then performs a  make-or-buy analysis   to determine 
whether it should complete the work internally or source the goods and services from 
external sources. After the decision has been made to go to external sources, the buying 
organization then decides what form of contract it will use, how it will inform potential 
sellers of its needs, and how it will select the successful seller. 
 When the contract has been signed, both parties take responsibility for checking that 
the agreed contract terms are being followed and that any changes to the contract are 
formally documented. 
 Finally, all contracts must be closed. Contractual closure does not mean project 
closure, because contracts can be closed at any time during a project. Remember, 
contractual closure must be performed before project closure. 
 In any contract there are  buyers , the party looking to acquire the goods or services, 
and there are  sellers , the parties with goods or services to sell. There can be multiple 
sellers, but generally there is a single buyer. 
 
■ Exam Tip   On the exam, unless otherwise stated, you should assume that you are 
the buyer in any contract. But read the question thoroughly to ensure that you understand 
whether you are the buyer or seller, because your answer to the question may be different 
depending on which position you are in. You can also be both buyer and seller at different 
points in the project. Take your time reading the question to understand the perspective from 
which you are answering the question. 
 Plan Procurement Management 
 
■ More Info   Plan Procurement Management 
 You can read more about the Plan Procurement Management process in the PMBOK Guide, 
5th edition, in Chapter   12  , section 12.1. Table  10-1 identifies the process inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
407
 The Plan Procurement Management process is a planning process with the 
procurement management plan and procurement statement of work as its main outputs. 
The purpose of this process is, as with other planning processes, to enable you and your 
team to proactively plan your particular approach to procurement requirements on the 
project. 
 The Plan Procurement Management process covers the following planning domain 
task:
• 
 Task 7: Develop the procurement management plan based on the 
project scope, budget, and schedule, in order to ensure that the 
required project resources will be available. 
 Inputs 
 The Plan Procurement Management process uses some or all of the following inputs as 
part of the development of the procurement management plan for the project. 
 Project Management Plan 
 The  project management plan is a key input into the Plan Procurement Management 
process because it contains vital information about the scope of work and elements 
of the scope of work that need to be considered for external procurement. These 
potential procurement elements are described in the scope baseline, which includes the 
scope statement, work breakdown structure (WBS), and WBS dictionary. The project 
management plan is an output from the Develop Project Management Plan process.

 Requirements Documentation 
 The  requirements documentation includes information about specific project 
requirements that can be taken into consideration when looking at whether to make a 
requirement internally or procure it from external sources and, if the decision is made 
to procure it from external sources, what sort of contract is best to use.  Requirements 
documentation is an output from the Collect Requirements process.  
 Risk Register 
 The  risk register  is an important input into the Plan Procurement Management process 
because it identifies specific risks around the decision to make goods or services 
internally versus the decision to procure them from external sources, and the risks 
associated with individual contract types. The risk register is an output from the Identify 
Risks process. 
 Activity Resource Requirements 
 Activity resource requirements contain information about the resources required to 
complete individually identified activities; this information can be useful when making 
decisions about whether to procure goods and services externally and the type of contract 
to use. Activity resource requirements are an output from the Estimate Activity Resources 
process. 
 Project Schedule 
 The  project schedule is a key input into the Plan Procurement Management process 
because it outlines the planned deliverable dates of particular activities and tasks, and 
this information is used when negotiating contracts. The project schedule is an output 
from the Develop Schedule process. 
 Activity Cost Estimates 
 Activity  cost estimates  include the cost estimates of individual activities, which can then 
be used to anticipate what likely contractual responses will be and assess whether they 
are reasonable and accurate. Activity  cost estimates are an output from the Estimate Costs 
process. 
 Stakeholder Register 
 The  stakeholder register identifies individual stakeholders and their interest in the 
project. Thus it is useful in terms of managing stakeholder expectations around which 
goods and services will be procured externally and the type of contract selected. The 
stakeholder register is an output from the Identify Stakeholders process. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
409
 
REAL WORLD
 The type of contract selected will have an impact on the stakeholders, particularly 
if stakeholders are to be intimately involved in the administration and execution 
of the contract. Many types of contracts set up an adversarial relationship with 
stakeholders, whereas other more modern forms of contract establish a relationship 
based on trust between stakeholders. Thus, having an in-depth knowledge of how 
your stakeholders will perceive and react to different contractual decisions is an 
important consideration in your procurement management process. A style of 
contract that works for one group of stakeholders may not work for another group of 
stakeholders. Also, keep in mind that many stakeholders will have preferred vendors 
and long-established types of contracts with them. 
 Enterprise Environmental Factors 
 The specific  enterprise environmental factors that are useful as inputs into the Plan 
Procurement Management process include any marketplace conditions that determine 
whether there will be a lot of interest in your procurement decisions, the specific types of 
products and services available in a particular marketplace, the size of the marketplace 
and whether you can stay local or have to go wider in your  search  for suppliers, and the 
expected terms and conditions for contract types with particular industries. 
 Organizational Process Assets 
 The specific  organizational process assets  that may be important inputs into the Plan 
Procurement Management process include any formal procurement policies the 
organization has that state what goods and services will be procured, how the decisions 
will be made, what sort of contract types are preferred, and who has responsibility in 
negotiating and administering the contracts. 
 
REAL WORLD
 I have found that most organizations have clear procurement policies that specify 
when external procurement can be or must be used, and the type of contract that 
the organization prefers. You should always endeavor to familiarize yourself with any 
procurement policies your organization has. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
410
 
■ Exam Tip   You must always conduct procurement in accordance with the relevant 
organizational procurement guidelines. Don’t be tempted to act outside of the guidelines: 
if the guidelines are wrong, you can seek to change them; but until they are changed, you 
must adhere to them. 
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques are available to be used to develop the inputs in this 
process in order to produce the procurement management plan. 
 Make-or-Buy Analysis 
 The  make-or-buy analysis  is a comprehensive description of the decision-making process 
an organization goes through when deciding whether it should make the goods or 
services it requires itself or seek to acquire goods or services from external sources. There 
are a number of ways of making the decision and a number of factors to take into account. 
 Of the factors that can be taken into account when making a make-or-buy decision, 
the following are the most important:
• 
 The organization’s risk profile and risk tolerance  
• 
 Ownership of intellectual property 
• 
 Availability of suitable sellers 
• 
 Availability of internal resources capable of delivering a good or 
service 
• 
 Timeframes for delivery of a good or service 
• 
 Length of time the resource required for the good or service is 
needed on the project 
• 
 Ability to support ongoing changes and technical support    
 The make-or-buy process should follow established procedures that take into 
account the relevant factors. You can even assign weights to various factors to enable you 
to score factors differently. 
 In making make-or-buy decisions, you may also want to use more quantitative 
methods such as the decision tree analysis used in Chapter   9 in the Quantitative Risk 
Analysis section. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
411
 Expert Judgment 
 Expert judgment is an excellent tool to use when planning your approach to procurement 
management. Using the knowledge and experience of subject matter experts will be 
invaluable not only in your overall procurement management plan, but also in identifying 
and completing an analysis of procurements. Suitable experts who may provide judgment 
include senior management, stakeholders with relevant experience, external subject 
matter experts such as procurement professionals, industry groups, and professional 
associations. 
 One  particularly useful type of expert that you should consider using in your 
procurement management decisions is the legal expert. Your procurement decisions 
will be supported by legally enforceable contracts, so it is highly recommended that 
you involve experts with legal experience in the formation, negotiation, execution, and 
administration of any procurement contracts. 
 
REAL WORLD
 I have always found that referring decisions about contracts to legal experts is a 
good investment. The wording of contracts can be complicated, and it often takes 
somebody with particular experience in an area to be able to effectively negotiate 
a contract that is easy to understand and enforce and doesn’t place an undue 
amount of work on one or the other of the parties involved. Certainly any changes or 
variations to contracts should involve people with legal expertise. 
 Market Research 
 Market research  is carried out to determine the capability and availability of potential 
sellers in the market and their interest in responding to your procurement requests. 
Additionally, any market research you carry out may reveal additional ways of delivering 
goods and services; as such, it is an important tool in the Plan Procurement Management 
process. 
 Meetings 
 Meetings are a  great  way to bring together project team members, stakeholders, and 
other experts to consider how procurement will be managed on the project. There are a 
number of ways you can run these meetings in order to efficiently obtain the information 
you require. They can be run formally with defined agendas and examination of reports, 
or they can be run as creative brainstorming sessions. The style of meeting you choose to 
use will reflect the participants and your intended outcomes.   

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
412
 Outputs 
 After the appropriate tools and techniques have been applied to the selected inputs, the 
Plan Procurement Management process has the following outputs. 
 Procurement Management Plan 
 The Plan  Procurement Management process  has the  procurement management plan as 
its major output. Similar to other management plans, the procurement management plan 
provides a guide for completing the procurement management activities in the project. 
The procurement management plan will probably contain information about the types 
of contracts to be used, whether independent estimates will be used to check responses 
received, any methods for identifying and selecting sellers, and any other important 
procurement information that can be used in the other three procurement processes. 
The procurement management plan goes on to be used as an input into the Conduct 
Procurements process. Given that it is also a subsidiary plan of the project management 
plan, is used as an input into the Control Procurements process and Close Procurements 
process. 
 Procurement Statement of Work 
 The  procurement  statement of work  is an output that describes each good or service 
that will be procured externally in enough detail to allow potential sellers to determine 
whether they are interested in and able to provide the goods or services sought. You 
should spend as much time as possible defining the procurement statement of work 
because it will form the basis of your procurement contracts, and any omissions or areas 
that are not sufficiently defined may cause conflict in the administration of  the   contract. 
 
■ Exam Tip   You can think of the procurement statement of work as a type or subset of 
the project scope of work specifically focused on the work to be done as part of a contract 
for goods and services. 
 Procurement Documents 
 A variety of key  procurement documents are produced as a  result  of the Plan Procurement 
Management process. They are useful in soliciting responses from prospective sellers and 
will form the basis of the contracts that will eventually be agreed on. Some of the more 
common types of procurement documents include the following:
• 
 Request for information (RFI) 
• 
 Expression of interest (EOI) 
• 
 Invitation for bid (IFB) 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
413
• 
  Request for proposal (RFP) 
• 
  Request for quotation (RFQ) 
• 
 Tender 
 
REAL WORLD
 If you have ever been involved in any formal seller-selection process, you will find 
this section very straightforward. However, if you have not been involved in formal 
contractual negotiation processes, pay particular attention. It is not uncommon for a 
project manager to receive negotiated contracts without being involved in the make-
or-buy decisions, seller selection, and contractual negotiations. 
 Source-Selection Criteria 
 The point of  source-selection criteria is to enable the buyer to  rate   individual seller 
responses. They can include both objective and subjective criteria. The source-selection 
criteria reflect the criteria that are important to you and your decision-making process 
for selecting sellers. In addition to the prices submitted, you may also want to take 
into account a variety of other factors and give them a particular weight to reflect their 
importance. Examples of the types of criteria you may want to take into account include 
how well the seller understands your needs beyond what you may have described in the 
procurement statement of work, their technical ability to deliver the requested solution, 
the financial stability of the organization, their previous experience doing this type of 
work, and references from other buyers who may have used this seller. You can use the 
source-selection criteria during the Conduct Procurements process. 
 
REAL WORLD
 There are certain occasions when your only source-selection criterion will be the 
lowest price; however, in many instances you will want to take into account other 
criteria in selecting a seller. Typically, you should look at their experience, their 
financial stability, the staff members who are allocated to do the work, and other 
factors such as health and safety and environmental record. 
 Make-or-Buy Decisions 
 The output from the  make-or-buy analysis will be  make-or-buy decisions . These 
documented decisions outline how you decided to either make the goods or services 
internally or go to external sources. Make-or-buy decisions are used as an  input  into the 
Conduct Procurements process. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
414
 Change Requests 
 As a result of  carrying   out the Plan Procurement Management process, you may want 
to change some elements and subsidiary plans or baselines of the project management 
plan via a change request. All change requests go on to be used as inputs into the Perform 
Integrated Change-control process. 
 Project Document Updates 
 The types of project  documents  that may be updated as a result of completing the Plan 
Procurement Management process are the project scope, requirements documentation, 
risk register, and stakeholder register. 
 Quick Check 
 
 1. 
 What is the main focus of the Plan Procurement Management 
process? 
 
 2. 
 What are some of the factors you take into account when 
conducting a make-or-buy analysis? 
 
 3. 
 What are some typical factors included in source-selection 
criteria? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
  The main focus of the Plan Procurement Management process 
is to make decisions and provide a documented guideline 
for the rest of the procurement management processes. This 
information is contained in the procurement management 
plan, which is a subsidiary of the project management plan. 
 
 2. 
 The types of factors that can be taken into account when 
conducting a make-or-buy analysis include the risk profile 
of the organization, the issue of ownership of intellectual 
property, the timeframe in which the work must be done, 
the current capability of internal resources, and the cost 
differential between choosing to make a good or service 
internally and procuring it externally. 
 
 3. 
 In addition to including the price in the source-selection 
criteria, you may choose to include how well the seller 
understands your needs, their proposed response and the life-
cycle cost, their technical ability to deliver the solution, the 
staff they have allocated to do the work and their experience, 
any warranties they offer on the work being completed, the 
financial capacity and stability of the performing organization, 
their past performance in doing this type of work, references 
from others who have used them, and who owns the rights to 
the work done.

 The Conduct Procurements process is an executing process that seeks to carry out 
the initial identification of prospective sellers, effectively pass on to them information 
about the work required, get responses from the sellers, evaluate and select the best seller 
for the job, and sign an agreement or contract. 
 The Conduct Procurements process covers the following executing domain task:
• 
  Task 1: Acquire and manage project resources by following the 
human resource and procurement management plans, in order to 
meet project requirements. 
 Inputs 
 The Conduct Procurements process uses some or all of the following inputs. 
 Procurement Management Plan 
 The procurement  management plan  is an important input into the Conduct 
Procurements process because it outlines exactly how the Conduct Procurements process 
will be carried out. The procurement management plan is an output from the Plan 
Procurement Management process. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
416
 Procurement Documents 
 The  procurement documents  are an output from the Plan Procurement Management 
process and include a range of different documents for soliciting information from 
prospective sellers. As such, they are an important input into the Conduct Procurements 
process. 
 Source-Selection Criteria 
 Source-selection criteria  are used during the Conduct Procurements process to enable an 
evaluation of sellers against predetermined criteria that are important to the organization 
buying the goods or services. Source-selection criteria are an output from the Plan 
Procurement Management process. 
 Seller Proposals 
 Seller proposals are documents received from interested sellers in response to a particular 
procurement documents package that you have put out to the market. They are in the 
form prescribed in the procurement documents and contain enough information for the 
buyer to evaluate the response and decide whether the seller is to go on to the next stage 
in the procurement process. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Did you notice that seller proposals are not an output from any other 
process? Instead, they are an independent input into this process. 
 Project Documents 
 The specific types of  project documents that are useful as inputs into the Conduct 
Procurements process include risk-related contract decisions captured by the risk 
register, which is an output from the Plan Risk Responses process.  
 Make-or-Buy Decisions 
 The documented  make-or-buy decisions are used as an input into the Conduct 
Procurements process to enable verification of the decisions made about which goods 
or services to procure externally. Make-or-buy decisions are an output from the Plan 
Procurement Management process. 
 Procurement Statement of Work 
 The procurement  statement of work is required as an input into the Conduct 
Procurements process because it forms the basis of any procurement documents to go 
out to the market for sellers to review and respond to. The procurement statement of work 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
417
should be as detailed as possible, because sellers’ responses will only be as detailed as the 
procurement statement of work. The procurement statement of work is an output from 
the Plan Procurement Management process. 
 
REAL WORLD
 A poorly worded procurement statement of work will lead to assumptions 
about what work is included and what is excluded from the contract, and these 
assumptions can lead to requests to change the contract or to contractual disputes. 
It is a good idea to make the procurement statement of work as detailed as possible 
to avoid these potential problems. 
 Organizational Process Assets 
 The specific types of  organizational process assets that assist in the Conduct 
Procurements process include any historical information about market conditions, 
databases of prospective or prequalified sellers, and any other information about 
previous experience with sellers. 
 
REAL WORLD
 Many organizations keep lists or databases of prequalified sellers that have already 
gone through a selection process and met defined requirements to be able to 
provide goods or services to the organization. Usually the organization will simply 
issue procurement requests to these prequalified sellers and only go to the wider 
market when none of the prequalified sellers is able to provide the required good or 
service. 
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques are used on the inputs to deliver the Conduct 
Procurements process outputs. 
 Bidder Conference 
 A  bidder conference is any type of formal meeting between the buyer and all prospective 
sellers for the purpose of exchanging further information and answering questions. 
Bidder conferences are generally fairly formal with rules to ensure fairness to all sellers 
participating in the process. They are also increasingly held virtually, with Internet 
forums being used to solicit questions and provide answers. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
418
 It is extremely  important  that you keep all bidder conferences fair and equitable 
to all sellers involved in the process. This means if a seller asks you a question, you 
must provide the answer to all bidders. As a general rule, you should refuse to go into 
private talks with any seller during this process unless it is for commercially confidential 
information. This is not merely a good suggestion but also often a legal, commercial, or 
organizational requirement  in many countries, and failure to follow it could result in your 
decision being challenged in court. 
 Proposal Evaluation Techniques 
 Proposal evaluation techniques include a range of methods for evaluating and scoring the 
different responses received from individual sellers. They can use the source-selection 
criteria to provide a weighted-attribute selection model. They can also take into account 
any other important elements useful in differentiating and distinguishing between seller 
responses. 
 Independent Estimates 
 Independent estimates are used as a technique to ensure that the seller responses 
in relation to cost are reasonable. You will want to carry out your own independent 
estimates to ensure that sellers are not bidding either far too high or too low, both of 
which indicate potential problems. Sellers bidding high can indicate either collusion 
between sellers or more commonly, incorrect information contained in the procurement 
statement of work, or information that is being misinterpreted. 
 A range of prices lower than your independent estimates could indicate once again 
that the procurement statement of work and procurement documents provided are 
inaccurate, or that an organization is deliberately bidding low in order to win the work. 
The risk in this case is that the organization may go out of business trying to complete the 
work or that it is relying on variations to the contract to make the job profitable. 
 Expert Judgment 
 Expert judgment  is an excellent tool to use in evaluating seller proposals. The range 
of experts you will use during this process include people with experience in the 
procurement response process, contract negotiation and administration process, legal 
process, finance process, and any other relevant areas of expertise.  
 Advertising 
 Advertising is a tool you may choose to use in order to take your procurement proposals 
to a wider market. You may choose to advertise in specific industry publications or 
more broadly in public newspapers. The type of advertising you choose will reflect the 
audience you are trying to reach. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
419
 Analytical Techniques 
 Analytical techniques involve a detailed analysis of the seller responses to examine them 
for completeness and accuracy to ensure that the seller is able to carry out the work. You 
may choose to bring in independent experts to carry out audits of the seller responses 
and even of the sellers’ organizations, particularly in relation to financial capability and 
stability. 
 Procurement Negotiations 
 Procurement  negotiations    can be simple and straightforward, or they can be highly 
complex affairs requiring teams of experts and a long period of time to work out. The end 
result is a contract that both parties are happy to commit themselves to. 
 
REAL WORLD
 Like project management, the world of contract negotiation requires a distinct set of 
skills and experience. I have found that if you are entering into complex negotiations, 
you should enlist the help of experts with both technical expertise and negotiation 
expertise. 
 Outputs 
 The Conduct Procurements process has the following outputs. 
 Selected Sellers 
 After carrying out the Conduct Procurements process and advertising for sellers, carrying 
out bidder conferences, evaluating seller responses, and negotiating contracts, you will 
choose the  selected sellers to provide the goods or services required for the project. 
 Agreements 
 A procurement  agreement is generally reflected in a contract between the organizations 
involved in buying or selling the goods or services for the project. It is important to 
keep in mind that a contract is a legally binding document with conditions that must be 
understood by both parties. Most agreements or contracts feature the following content 
in their terms and conditions:
• 
 Description of the parties to the contract 
• 
  The outline of the work to be done as part of the contract  
• 
  The timeframe for delivery 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT

REAL WORLD
 I’ve found that many project managers do not take the time to read a contract 
in its entirety. I strongly recommend that if you have any contracts for work on a 
project, either as a buyer or seller, you take the time to read the entire contract and 
understand the terms and conditions it contains. If you do not understand certain 
parts of the contract, you should seek clarification from experts who do. 
 There are several forms of contract you can use. The differences between the forms 
reflect the risk apportioned to the buyer or the seller. Table  10-3 lists the types of contracts 
and indicates where risk is apportioned.  

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
421
 Table 10-3.  Types of  Contracts 
 Type of Contract 
 Description 
 Risk Apportionment 
 Fixed-price contract 
(also known as lump 
sum contract) 
 A form of contract that includes 
an agreed, fixed price for the 
delivery of goods and services. 
There are several variations, as 
follows: 
 1.  Firm fixed-price contract (FFP) 
with no provision at all for cost 
overruns 
 2.  Fixed-price incentive fee 
contract (FPIF), which offers an 
incentive fee for meeting cost 
or time targets 
 3.  Fixed-price with economic 
price adjustment contract 
(FP-EPA), which is often used 
on longer contracts and allows 
prices to be amended to reflect 
changes in inflation rates or 
exchange  rates   
 Seller has the risk. If the 
cost to deliver the goods or 
services is greater than the 
fixed price, the seller bears 
the extra costs. 
 Cost-reimbursable 
contract 
 A form of contract that requires 
the seller to pass on the actual 
cost of the work to be done. There 
are several variations, including 
the following: 
 •  Cost plus fixed-fee contract 
(CPFF), which reimburses the 
seller for actual costs incurred 
and provides an additional fixed 
fee 
 •  Cost plus incentive fee contract 
(CPIF), which reimburses the 
seller for actual costs incurred 
and offers an incentive fee for 
meeting or exceeding agreed 
cost or time targets 
 Risk is split between buyer 
and seller, depending on the 
actual form and wording of 
the contract. 
 Time and material 
contract (T&M) 
 A form of contract where the 
seller charges for all time spent 
and materials used with no 
agreed maximum. This form 
of contract is typically used on 
projects that are either small and 
of low complexity or emergency 
works, or where there is a poorly 
defined scope of work.  
 Buyer has the risk because 
there is no agreed maximum 
price. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
422
 A method for determining where risk lies between buyer and seller cost is to use 
the calculation for  point of total assumption (PTA) , particularly when using  fixed-price 
incentive fee (FPIF)  forms of contract. The  point of total assumption is the point in the 
contract where the seller assumes total responsibility for all cost increases. In order to 
calculate this, you need a contract that has an agreed maximum ceiling price,  target  cost 
to the seller, target price to the buyer, and agreed ratio between buyer and seller of the 
percentages of costs over the target cost each party is responsible for. 
 For example, consider a fixed-price incentive fee contract with a seller that sets a 
maximum price the buyer will pay (ceiling price) for the contract of $50,000, a target 
cost to the seller of $42,000, and a target price to the buyer of $46,000. There is also an 
agreement that the buyer will pay 60% of the cost overrun above the target cost. Using 
these figures, you can use the following formula to calculate the point of total assumption:
 
Point of total assumption
Target cost
Ceiling price Target price
=

-
(

æ
è

 For this example: 
 Point of total assumption = $42,000 + (($50,000 – $46,000)/0.6) 
 
= $42,000 + ($4 000/0.6) 
 
= $42,000 + $6,666.67 
 
= $48,666.67 
 The point at  which  the seller assumes total responsibility for all cost increases is 
$48,666.67. After this price is reached, the buyer has no further obligation. 
 Resource Calendars 
 A  resource calendar is a useful output from the Conduct Procurements process because 
it documents the resources committed to delivering the goods and services as part of the 
contract and the dates on which those resources are or are not available. The resource 
calendar goes on to be used as an input into the Estimate Activity Resources, Estimate Activity 
Duration, Develop Schedule, Determine Budget, and Develop Project Team processes.  
 Change Requests 
 As a result of carrying out the Conduct Procurements process, you may discover that 
changes need to be made to the project management plan, subsidiary plans, or baselines 
to reflect work that has been negotiated and agreed to. Any  change requests will be used 
as inputs into the Perform Integrated Change-control process. 
 Project Management Plan Updates 
 The specific parts of the project management  plan that may be updated as a result of 
carrying out the Conduct Procurements process are the cost baseline, scope baseline, 
and schedule baseline, to reflect any amendments made as a result of contractual 
negotiations. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
423
 Project Document Updates 
 The specific project  documents that will be updated include requirements 
documentation, the risk register, and any historical information.

 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
  The Conduct Procurements process is focused on carrying out 
the process documented in the procurement management 
plan. This involves going to prospective sellers with 
information about the required goods and services, carrying 
out a fair and transparent process for selecting the sellers to 
do the work, and negotiating contracts. 
 
 2. 
  In order to solicit professional and fair responses to your 
procurement process, it is important to treat all potential 
sellers or bidders equitably and provide them all with the 
same information. 
 
 3. 
  There are several benefits to carrying out your own 
independent estimates. The first is to ensure that the 
estimates you are being provided with by potential sellers are 
neither too high nor too low, perhaps indicating incorrect 
or insufficient information contained in the procurement 
statement of work. Another benefit of carrying out your 
own independent estimates is to independently check the 
accuracy of responses received from sellers.

  The project manager should take responsibility for carrying 
out procurement negotiations, with the assistance of people 
with technical, legal, financial, and negotiation skills. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT

 5. 
 The form of contract that most favors a buyer in terms of risk 
is a fixed-price contract, because in this instance the risk is 
with the seller, particularly if they have developed estimates 
based on inaccurate or incomplete information. 
 
 6. 
 You would generally choose to use a time and materials form 
of contract when the work is small and ill defined, or under 
emergency conditions where the work must be completed 
quickly and there is not time to negotiate any other form of 
contract.

 The Control Procurements process is a monitoring and controlling process focused 
on the sometimes complex process of checking that your procurement process and 
contracts entered into comply with both your procurement management plan and the 
terms and conditions contained within the negotiated contracts and agreements. 
 
■ Exam Tip   It is the responsibility of all parties to a contract to carry out work to ensure 
that the terms and conditions of the contract are being fulfilled. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
425
 The Control Procurements process covers the following monitoring and controlling 
domain task:
• 
  Task 7: Monitor procurement activities according to the 
procurement plan, in order to verify compliance with project 
objectives. 
 Inputs 
 The following inputs are used in the Control Procurements process. 
 Project Management Plan 
 The  project management plan is a key input into the Control Procurements process, 
especially the procurement management plan, which is a subsidiary plan. Specific 
elements of the project management plan that are useful include the scope management 
plan, the schedule management plan, and the cost management plan. The project 
management plan is an output from the Develop Project Management Plan process. 
 Procurement Documents 
 The specific  procurement documents that are useful as inputs into the Control 
Procurements process include any documents from the Conduct Procurements process 
that result in legal agreements being signed. You need these documents in addition to the 
individual agreements to understand the full breadth of agreements you are monitoring. 
Procurement documents are an output from the Plan Procurement Management process.  
 Agreements 
 You require any and all binding agreements between parties to all contracts in order 
to understand the terms and conditions and performance criteria you are monitoring. 
 Agreements  are an output from the Conduct Procurements process.  
 Approved Change Requests 
 Approved change requests can affect and modify any agreed terms and conditions of 
agreements or contracts. They are often referred to as  variations , and it is important that 
as part of the Control Procurements process you check not only that the changes have 
been approved or agreed to, but also that they are being carried out as per the agreed 
change. Approved change requests are an output from the Perform Integrated Change-
control process. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
426
 Work Performance Reports 
 Work performance reports are the result when work performance information interprets 
work performance data. Work performance reports are useful in determining whether the 
terms and conditions of individual agreements are being met by parties to the agreement. 
Work performance reports are an output from the Control Project Work process. 
 Work Performance Data 
 Work performance data that specifically relates to whether quality standards are being 
met is important in any assessment of whether contractual obligations are being met. 
Work performance data is an output from the Direct and Manage Project Work process. 
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques of this process can be used on the separate inputs to 
deliver the Control Procurements process outputs. 
 Contract Change-Control System 
 A  contract change-control system , which includes the processes, guidelines, and tracking 
systems for reporting all requested changes, all variations, and the decisions made about 
them, is essential when monitoring the performance or lack of performance of any 
procurement agreements. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Any and all changes to a contract need to be recorded in formally and in 
writing to reflect the formal nature of a contract. 
 Procurement Performance Reviews 
 As part of the normal course of administering a negotiated contract, it is common for the 
buyer to carry out  procurement  performance reviews . This involves comparing the seller’s 
performance against the agreed and documented criteria in the contract. The purpose 
of the procurement performance reviews is to determine whether there is any variance 
between what was agreed to and what is actually occurring. 
 
■ Exam Tip   A procurement performance review is essentially the quality assurance 
process for any negotiated contracts. It focuses on the agreed processes contained within 
the negotiated contract and not the actual deliverable. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
427
 Inspections and Audits 
 Other key tools and techniques that can be used in the Control Procurements process 
are inspections and  audits . Inspections are used to check deliverables, whereas audits 
are used to check that any agreed processes are being followed. As with other areas that 
use audits as a tool, it is often a good idea for them to be completed by independent 
personnel. 
 Performance Reporting 
 Performance reporting takes information gathered as part of procurement performance 
reviews, inspections, and audits and presents it to management so that the seller’s 
performance against agreed contractual objectives can be easily communicated. There 
are a number of methods and formats for reporting performance, including text, graphics, 
color coding, and pictures. 
      Payment Systems 
 Payment systems are used to record invoices received and payments made to the seller, 
and to ensure that they are in accordance with the agreed payment terms in the contract. 
 
■ Exam Tip   All payments made as part of a negotiated and agreed contract should be 
strictly in accordance with the contract. Don’t be tempted to make payments outside of the 
agreed terms. 
 Claims Administration 
 Claims administration is used when there is a dispute about the amount charged or 
the work done as part of a contract. It is generally a result of poorly worded contracts 
or a poorly defined scope of work. Claims can be made by either the buyer or the seller 
in a contract and are usually made for something to be done outside of the agreed 
procurement statement of work. If agreement is reached, then the claim ceases and 
a change is made to the contract. Resolving claims often requires the use of dispute-
resolution techniques. 
 
■ Exam Tip   The word  claim refers to a disputed cost or change. If you use this word in 
everyday language to mean something else, you must remember that for the exam, this is 
the correct definition. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
428
 
REAL WORLD
 The process of claims administration is unfortunately a very common and often 
complex reality of dealing with contracts, generally arising as a result of poorly 
negotiated or ambiguously worded contracts. Avoiding this potential minefield is a 
simple process of taking extra time when writing up the original contract and being 
as explicit as possible about as many potential scenarios as possible to avoid extra 
time spent disagreeing about what the costs were and whether work performed 
constituted an agreed change to the contract. 
 Records Management System 
 A comprehensive   records management system is essential for dealing with and recording 
all contract-related agreements and variations. The records management system is a 
subset of the project management information system. 
 
REAL WORLD
 Given that contracts are formal, written legal documents, you should ensure that 
your records management system reflects the importance of this and captures 
information in such a way that it can be retrieved, that it is accurate, and that it will 
be useful if any disputes escalate to litigation. 
 Outputs 
 The Control Procurements process has the following outputs. 
 Work Performance Information 
 As with other monitoring and control processes, the Control Procurements process has 
 work performance information as a major output. The work performance information 
compiles information gathered as a result of using the Control Procurements tools 
and techniques and presents it in a way that the intended audience can easily obtain 
relevant information about the project performance, specifically in relation to contractual 
administration and compliance. Work performance information can also be used by 
one contractual party to inform the other party of any areas of noncompliance. Work 
performance information is used as an input into the Control Project Work process. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
429
 Change Requests 
 Change requests are a common output from any monitoring and control process. For the 
Control Procurements process, change requests relate to both internal project processes 
and also to change requests for the negotiated contracts. 
 
REAL WORLD
 It is very important that you document any and all changes, no matter how small, to 
any contract. 
 Project Management Plan Updates 
 As a result of carrying out the Control Procurements process, you may update specific 
elements of the project management  plan , which obviously include the procurement 
management plan and other plans and baselines such as the scope baseline, cost 
baseline, and schedule baseline. 
      Project Document Updates 
 The specific types of project documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out 
the Control Procurements process are generally focused on procurement  documentation , 
such as the initial description of work, processes relating to the selection of sellers, and 
any documents relating to how contracts are monitored. 
 Organizational Process Assets Updates 
 The specific  organizational process assets that will be updated as a result of the Control 
Procurements process are any historical information databases, correspondence files, 
records of payments made, and internal documentation regarding seller performance.

 2. 
  What is the benefit of having a payment system in place? 
 
 3. 
 Why is it important to keep well-documented records of any 
claims made? 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
430
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 The Control Procurements process is focused on checking 
that the procurements process is being carried out as per the 
procurement management plan, and also that the terms and 
conditions of any contracts being used are being met by both 
parties. 
 
 2. 
 Having a payment system in place ensures that all payments 
required as part of the agreed contractual terms and 
conditions are paid on time and records are kept.  
 
 3. 
 If a claim has been made, that means there is a disagreement 
about performance on a contract. Disagreements can escalate 
and require dispute resolution. Having well-documented 
records will assist during any dispute-resolution process.       
 Close Procurements 
 
■ More Info   Close Procurements 
 You can read more about the Close Procurements process in the PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, 
in Chapter   11 , section 12.4. Table  10-5 identifies the process inputs, tools and techniques, 
and outputs.

 The Close Procurements process is a closing process focused on ensuring that all 
contracts used in the project are either closed according to the documented terms and 
conditions, or closed as a result of nonperformance. 
 The Close Procurements process covers the following closing domain tasks:
• 
 Task 1: Obtain final acceptance of the project deliverables from 
relevant stakeholders, in order to confirm that project scope and 
deliverables were achieved. 
• 
 Task 3:   Obtain financial, legal, and administrative closure 
using generally accepted practices and policies, in order to 
communicate formal project closure and ensure transfer of 
liability. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
431
 Inputs 
 The following inputs are used in the Close Procurements process. 
 Project Management Plan 
 The  project management plan outlines the particular way in which you will carry out 
the closure of all contracts. Because contracts typically reflect many different aspects 
of the project, many subsidiary plans and baselines of the project management plan 
are required in order to successfully close procurements or contracts. The project 
management plan is an output from the Develop Project Management Plan process. 
 Procurement Documents 
 Obviously, in order to close any procurements, you require the relevant procurement 
documents that outline either the agreed terms and conditions for normal contractual 
closure or the processes for terminating a contract due to nonperformance. You also want 
 procurement documents that relate to how well the contractual terms have been met, 
how well the deliverables have been delivered, what payments have already been made 
and whether there are retention payments, and any other relevant material. Procurement 
documents are an output from the Plan Procurement Management process.   
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques of this process can be used on the separate inputs to 
deliver the Close Procurements process outputs. 
 Procurement Audits 
 Procurement audits are structured reviews of how both the buyer and seller have carried 
out the procurement process. From the buyer’s point of view, the procurement audit 
checks that the procurement process has been carried out as planned and documented 
in the procurement management plan, right through to whether the seller met the terms 
and conditions of a negotiated contract. From the seller’s point of view, the procurement 
audit ill determines whether the procurement process as planned and documented has 
been followed for everything from responding to initial procurement requests through to 
product delivery and warranty requirements. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Both buyer and seller should carry out procurement audits to ensure that 
there are no disagreements about which parts of the contract have been met and which 
haven’t, and also for the benefit of developing and documenting any lessons learned for 
future procurement processes. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
432
 Procurement Negotiations 
 Despite your best efforts at documenting and describing contractual processes that 
include a clear final resolution and closure process, it is not uncommon for all parties 
to a contract to have to enter into some form of  procurement  negotiations to terminate 
the contract fully. In this instance, procurement negotiations can result in negotiated 
settlements that place agreed obligations and agreements on both buyer and seller as to 
final payments, warranty obligations, and other matters to enable the contract to be fully 
closed. If any disagreements arise as a result of misunderstandings or poorly worded 
contracts, and negotiated settlements cannot be achieved through direct negotiation by 
all parties to a contract, some form of escalation and external dispute resolution may have 
to be used, such as mediation, arbitration, or litigation. 
 Negotiation is  when two or more parties attempt to agree on a solution between 
themselves.  Mediation is when the disagreeing parties bring in an independent person 
to help them reach an agreement.  Arbitration is when the parties agree to allow an 
independent person to hear both sides of the story and make a binding decision. 
 Litigation  is when the parties resolve their disputes through the civil courts system. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Contracts should spell out very clearly what the process is for negotiated 
settlements or dispute resolution. They should include a section on how mediation and 
arbitration will be carried out and also when and where litigation can occur. 
 Records Management System 
 The  records management system is a way to record and store all records relating to 
procurement on a project. It is a part of the project management information system, and 
it should reflect the formal and legal nature of the procurement process. 
 
REAL WORLD
 Many countries have statutory requirements for how long contractual documents 
must be stored. It pays to check the local requirements are and make sure you meet 
them. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
433
 Outputs 
 The outputs from the Close Procurements process are the following. 
 Closed Procurements 
 The key outputs from the  Close  Procurements process are  closed procurements , which 
include formal documented proof that the contract terms have been met, settlement has 
been agreed, and thus the contract is now closed. Given that contracts are formal, legal, 
written documents, you should have formal, legal, written proof that a contract has been 
closed. Contractual closure does not mean project closure. Contracts can be closed at any 
time in a project. You will want to be sure that before you close a project, all contracts are 
closed. 
 
■ Exam Tip   All contracts on a project must be closed. They can be closed as part of 
normal and agreed processes, or they can be closed as a result of unusual circumstances. 
This also applies to the situation in which your project is suddenly terminated; you must 
still ensure that documentation records that contracts were closed under abnormal 
circumstances. You may get a question on the exam that presents a scenario in which you 
have been told to close a project immediately and but perhaps do not have the authority, 
money, or time to close contracts formally. This may certainly be the case in relation to 
formal contract closure, but you should still record that contracts have been closed as a 
result of abnormal circumstances. 
 Organizational Process Assets Updates 
 As a result of carrying out the Close Procurements process, you may want to update 
particular organizational process assets, including any templates, processes, or guidelines 
relating to how procurement is carried out and how deliverables are accepted; historical 
databases; and lessons-learned documentation to use in future procurements. 
 Quick Check 
 
 1. 
 What is the main focus of the Close Procurements process? 
 
 2. 
 Why is it sometimes necessary to use negotiated settlements 
to close contracts? 
 
 3. 
 What is the purpose of the records management system? 

CHAPTER 10 ■ PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT
434
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 The main purpose of the Close Procurements process is 
to ensure that all contracts being used on the project are 
formally closed and recorded as being so. 
 
 2. 
 Not all contracts end without some form of difference of 
opinion about what constitutes full and final closure or 
termination. In these instances, a contract is often terminated 
or closed as a result of negotiated settlement between both 
parties. 
 
 3. 
 The primary purpose of the records management system is to 
store any documents relating to the procurement process for 
future use. 
 Chapter Summary 
• 
 The Procurement Management knowledge area is focused 
on the development of a plan to guide decisions around 
external procurement of goods and services and the execution, 
monitoring, and control of this plan. 
• 
 The Plan Procurement Management process provides a 
procurement management plan and the procurement statement 
of work, both of which provide guidance for the subsequent 
processes for the work to be done as part of agreements. 
• 
 The Conduct Procurements process is an executing process that 
seeks to carry out the procurement management plan in relation 
to the identification of sellers, the distribution of information 
about the procurement statement of work to sellers, the selection 
of sellers to carry out the work, and the type of contract that will 
be used. 
• 
 The Control Procurements process is a monitoring and control 
process that seeks to check both that the procurement process is 
being carried out as per the procurement management plan and 
that the contracts are being carried out as per the agreed terms 
and conditions. 
• 
 The Close Procurements process, which is a closing process, seeks 
to ensure that all contracts entered into as part of a project are 
formally closed, either as part of normal procedure or as a result 
of nonperformance or disagreement.

 CHAPTER 11  
 Stakeholder Management 
 This chapter focuses on the topic of Project Stakeholder Management, which begins 
with an initiating process, Identify Stakeholders, to identify the stakeholders. Next, the 
process involves developing the stakeholder register that is used in the Plan Stakeholder 
Management process; this additional process involves developing the stakeholder 
management plan. The Manage Stakeholder Engagement process carries out the 
stakeholder management plan, and the Control Stakeholder Engagement process 
checks planned activities against what is actually occurring in relation to stakeholder 
management. 
 The PMBOK ®  Guide processes 
 Project Stakeholder Management knowledge area 
 The four processes in the Project Stakeholder Management knowledge area are as 
follows:
• 
 Identify Stakeholders (initiating process) 
• 
  Plan Stakeholder Management (planning process)  
• 
  Manage Stakeholder Engagement (executing process) 
• 
  Control Stakeholder Engagement (monitoring and controlling 
process) 
 What Is  Project Stakeholder Management ? 
 Project stakeholder management is focused on all the processes involved in identifying as 
many stakeholders as possible on a project, understanding their expectations and levels 
of engagement, planning how to proactively engage and influence them, checking that 
what you are doing is in accordance with the stakeholder management plan, and acting 
on any deviations or variances. 
 A  stakeholder is any person, group, or organization who can affect or be affected 
by your project. Stakeholders can have an impact on your project in both positive and 
negative ways. All projects have stakeholders interested in the outcomes and impact of 
the project. It is your job as project manager to identify all of these stakeholders and their 

CHAPTER 11 ■ STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
446
expectations, keep them engaged, and ensure that stakeholder satisfaction becomes a key 
project deliverable. The easiest way to do this is to ensure that stakeholder management 
is a continuous dialogue rather than a one-off event or a series of sporadic events. 
 A main objective of the stakeholder management process is to get stakeholders to 
support your project or at least not to oppose it. 
 In order to effectively understand and manage stakeholders’ engagement and 
expectations, you must be both proactive and influencing. Being  proactive means 
anticipating and planning, and it is the opposite of being reactive. By being proactive, you 
will minimize surprises that stakeholders can bring to the project. 
 To carry out effective influencing, you need to first ensure that you understand 
where stakeholders currently sit in relation to their expectations and engagement 
and know where you want them to be.  Influencing means using a variety of skills and 
techniques to modify, enhance, or reduce particular aspects of stakeholder engagement 
and expectations. These skills and techniques include effective communication, highly 
developed interpersonal skills, and the correct display of technical ability. A skilled 
project manager chooses which combination to use in order to maximize stakeholder 
influencing. 
 
■ Exam Tip   The success or failure of your efforts to identify and manage stakeholders 
will have a high degree of impact on whether your project is a success or failure. On the 
exam, you should treat any questions that refer to stakeholders as ones that require you to 
proactively define, manage, and influence their engagement and expectations. 
 
REAL WORLD
 I have often found that the actual or perceived success or failure of a project rests 
on how satisfied stakeholders are rather than technical measurements of cost or 
time. This is a sign of just how important it is to keep your stakeholders engaged 
and to ensure that their expectations are managed. 
 Identify Stakeholders 
 
■ More Info   Identify Stakeholders 
 You can read more about the Identify Stakeholders process in the PMBOK Guide, 5th edition, 
in Chapter   13 , section 13.1. Table  11-1 identifies the process inputs, tools and techniques, 
and outputs. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
447
 The Identify  Stakeholders  process is an initiating process with the stakeholder 
register as its sole output. The stakeholder register contains key information about 
stakeholders that can be used in the other stakeholder management processes. 
 The Identify Stakeholders process covers the following initiating  domain tasks :
• 
  Task 3: Perform stakeholder analysis using appropriate tools and 
techniques, in order to align expectations and gain support for the 
project. 
• 
  Task 8: Inform stakeholders of the approved project charter, in 
order to ensure common understanding of the key deliverables, 
milestones, and their roles and responsibilities.     
 Inputs 
 The Identify Stakeholders process uses some or all of the following inputs as part of the 
development of the stakeholder register for the project. 
 Project Charter 
 The  project charter contains information about internal and external stakeholders 
identified as part of project initiation, such as the customer, the project sponsor, and any 
other easily identified stakeholders. The project charter is an output from the Develop 
Project Charter process. 
 Procurement Documents 
 The  procurement documents are used as an input into the Identify Stakeholders process 
if a contract forms the basis of the project, because the parties to the contract are key 
stakeholders. Procurement documents are an output from the Plan Procurement 
Management process. 
 Enterprise Environmental Factors 
 The specific  enterprise environmental factors that are useful as inputs into this process 
are organizational culture and structure, any relevant government or industry standards, 
and any external cultural aspects of dealing with particular individuals or groups of 
stakeholders.

CHAPTER 11 ■ STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
448
 Organizational Process Assets 
 The specific  organizational process assets that may be important inputs into the 
development of your stakeholder register are any blank stakeholder register templates the 
organization has and lessons learned that your organization has gathered from previous 
projects. 
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques are available to be used to develop the inputs in this 
process in order to produce the stakeholder register. 
 Stakeholder Analysis 
 There are a number of ways to carry out  stakeholder analysis ; each of them seeks 
to identify the stakeholders’ interests, expectations, power, influence, and level of 
engagement in the project.  Stakeholder analysis begins with the use of information-
gathering techniques such as brainstorming, interviewing, and other data-gathering 
techniques to identify stakeholders. The information gathered as part of carrying out 
stakeholder analysis will enable you to clearly describe the power, interest, influence, 
impact, and engagement stakeholders have on your project; then you can develop a 
robust stakeholder management strategy. 
 After you have gathered data about stakeholders, there are a number of ways to 
present this data. A very popular way of graphically showing the level of impact or 
engagement a stakeholder has on your project is with a matrix displaying either power 
and interest, power and influence, or influence and impact on the x-axis and y- axis, 
respectively. Figure  11-1 shows an example of a power and interest matrix.  
 Figure 11-1.    A categorization of stakeholder power and interest using a matrix 
 
■ Exam Tip   Figure  11-1 is often called a  Gardner grid or matrix , named after one of the 
original authors who developed it. 
 

CHAPTER 11 ■ STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
449
 Another way to represent levels of stakeholder influence on your project is to use the 
 salience model , which maps stakeholders’ power, urgency, and legitimacy to place the 
stakeholders into one of seven possible categories, each of which begins with the letter 
 D . Figure  11-2  shows an example of a salience model and the seven possible categories 
of stakeholder. It shows, for example, that a stakeholder with high levels of power and 
urgency but a low level of legitimacy is categorized as dangerous, whereas a stakeholder 
with legitimacy and power but a low level of urgency is categorized as dominant.  
 Figure 11-2.  Salience model 
 
■ Exam Tip   The salience model was developed by Ronald Mitchell, Bradley Agle, and 
Donna Wood. If an exam question refers to any form of diagram by these authors, you will 
know it is referring to the salience model. 
 Expert Judgment 
 Expert judgment is a key tool to be used in the Identify Stakeholders process, because 
using experts with experience in the identification and assessment of stakeholders 
will ensure that you have a more complete stakeholder register. Particular experts you 
may want to consult with include the project sponsor, senior management, the key 
stakeholders themselves, other people who have worked in similar areas with relevant 
experience, and any subject matter experts in the area in which you are working. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Recall that when soliciting information from experts, you can use a wide 
variety of information-gathering techniques such as interviews, consultation, meetings, 
surveys, workshops, and focus groups. 
 

CHAPTER 11 ■ STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
450
 Meetings 
 Meetings  are an important tool for gathering, exchanging, and analyzing information 
gathered about stakeholders and their power, interest, influence, impact, engagement, 
and expectations. 
 Outputs 
 After applying the appropriate tools and techniques to the selected inputs, the Identify 
Stakeholders process has the following sole output. 
 Stakeholder Register 
 The Identify Stakeholders process has the stakeholder register as its sole output. The 
stakeholder register will probably contain information on the following:
• 
 A classification of stakeholder categories so you can distinguish 
between different stakeholders and their expectations and 
engagement 
• 
 Information about individual stakeholders and their contact details  
• 
  A description of the interest that each stakeholder has in the project  
• 
 An assessment of the stakeholders’ power, impact, influence, 
engagement, and interest in the project 
• 
 A description of the strategy to be employed to gain their support 
and keep them satisfied 
• 
 A description of the frequency and method by which you will 
revisit the  stakeholder register 
 
REAL WORLD
 Take great care with information that you record in your stakeholder register, and 
always keep in mind that a stakeholder may one day view the register; ensure that 
the information you include about your assessment of the stakeholders’ influence, 
impact, or engagement on the project will not adversely affect your project if the 
stakeholder reads the register. For example, on a project I worked on, one extremely 
difficult senior manager was part of the project control group and constantly failed 
to read reports, undermined project team members, and had a difficult interpersonal 
style. He also had the ability to greatly influence the project. As we documented his 
interest and impact on the project in the stakeholder register, we had to be careful 
how we described his interaction with the team, because if we had written what we 
really thought, it would have caused significant problems if he had viewed it. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
451
 The stakeholder register is used as an input into a number of processes, including 
the Collect Requirements process, the Plan Quality Management process, the Plan Risk 
Management process, the Identify Risks process, the Plan Procurement Management 
process, and the Plan Stakeholder Management process. This shows how important the 
stakeholder register is to multiple parts of the project.

assessment of the ways in which they can affect your project, 
and a consideration of the ways in which you can proactively 
manage and influence their engagement and expectations. 
 
 2. 
  A stakeholder is any individual, group, or organization that 
can affect or be affected by your project. 
 
 3. 
  Your primary objective when identifying and managing 
stakeholders on your project is to ensure that they stay 
engaged and their expectations are managed in order 
to ensure that they provide support to your project or, 
alternatively, do not oppose the project. 
 
 4. 
  The output from the Identify Stakeholders process is the 
stakeholder register, which is used as an input into the Collect 
Requirements process, the Plan Quality Management process, 
the Plan Risk Management process, the Identify Risks process, 
and the Plan Procurement Management process, all of which 
are outside the stakeholder management area. It is also used 
as an input into the Plan Stakeholder Management process.

 The Plan Stakeholder Management process is a planning process that seeks to 
identify how the project will affect stakeholders, how stakeholders will affect the project, 
and how the team will proactively manage levels of stakeholder engagement, proactively 
influence stakeholder expectations, and ensure stakeholder support for the project, its 
objectives, and its deliverables. 
 The Plan Stakeholder Management process covers the following  planning 
domain task :
• 
 Task 13: Develop the stakeholder management plan by analyzing 
needs, interests, and potential impact, in order to effectively 
manage stakeholders' expectations and engage them in project 
decisions. 
 
REAL WORLD
 A great deal of skill is required to be successful in proactively influencing 
stakeholder engagement and expectations. I strongly recommend that, as part of 
your professional development as a project manager, you focus on your ability to 
proactively influence stakeholders, because it is one of the key ways to ensure 
project success. Conversely, if it is done poorly, it is a surefire way to increase the 
chances of project failure. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
453
 Inputs 
 The Plan Stakeholder Management process uses some or all of the following inputs. 
 Project Management Plan 
 The  project management plan is an input into the Plan Stakeholder Management process 
because it provides a wealth of information about different aspects of the project that is 
useful in developing a stakeholder management plan. Specific information that will be 
useful includes the project life cycle, the methodology selected to execute the project, 
the project’s specific objectives and deliverables, and the forms of communication to be 
used. All this information can be found in different parts of the project management plan. 
The project management plan is an output from the Develop Project Management Plan 
process. 
 Stakeholder Register 
 The  stakeholder register is an extremely important input into the development of the 
stakeholder management plan because it outlines each of the stakeholders; their interest 
in the project; their power, interest, impact, and influence; and any particular identified 
ways of influencing both their engagement and expectations. The stakeholder register is 
an output from the Identify Stakeholders process. 
 Enterprise Environmental Factors 
 The specific types of  enterprise environmental factors that will be useful in the 
development of the stakeholder management plan are your particular organizational 
culture, structures, and internal and external political climate, because all of these will 
affect the method, frequency, and success or failure of your stakeholder management 
efforts. 
 Organizational Process Assets 
 The specific types of  organizational process assets that will assist in development of the 
stakeholder management plan include any lessons learned that your organization has 
gathered about stakeholder management activities from previous projects, any blank 
templates for the development of a stakeholder management plan, and any other relevant 
historical information.   
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques are used on the inputs to deliver the Plan Stakeholder 
Management process outputs. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
454
 Expert Judgment 
 Expert judgment  is an excellent tool to use in the Plan Stakeholder Management 
process because it allows you to bring together people with experience and skills in 
the identification of stakeholders and in the development of specific ways in which 
to manage both their engagement and expectations. You may choose to draw on the 
expertise of the project sponsor, senior management, other identified key stakeholders, 
subject matter experts with experience in the area in which your project is operating, and 
any other relevant experts. 
 Meetings 
 Meetings are an excellent tool for bringing together experts and members of the 
project team to carry out the process of developing and reassessing your stakeholder 
management plan throughout the life of your project. 
 A particularly effective meeting that can be useful in increasing levels of stakeholder 
engagement and proactively influencing stakeholder expectations is the kick-off meeting. 
The kick-off meeting is held after enough planning has been completed to enable the first 
project execution work to begin. It is used to bring stakeholders together face to face, to 
discuss the project and show everyone where the project is going. 
 Analytical Techniques 
 You may choose to use a variety of analytical techniques to assess the level of engagement 
of individual stakeholders. There are several ways of assessing and documenting different 
stakeholders and the level of engagement they have with the project. Figure  11-3 shows a 
 stakeholder engagement assessment matrix , which is a popular way of showing whether 
a stakeholder is unaware of the project, resistant to the project, neutral about the project, 
supportive of the project, or leading and actively engaged in ensuring that the project 
will be successful. The letter  C (Current) shows where the stakeholder currently is, and 
the letter  D (Desired) shows where you would like them to be; getting stakeholders to 
position D is the focus of your stakeholder management activities.

desired in the future 
 

CHAPTER 11 ■ STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
455
 Outputs 
 The Plan Stakeholder Management process has the following outputs. 
 Stakeholder Management Plan 
 The  stakeholder management plan is the key output from the Plan Stakeholder 
Management process. The stakeholder management plan uses the information gathered 
from the stakeholder register to provide a plan that identifies stakeholder engagement 
and expectations and sets out a clear strategy for managing and influencing engagement 
and expectations to ensure that stakeholders are supportive of the project or at least do 
not oppose the project. The stakeholder management plan is used as an input into the 
Manage Stakeholder Engagement process. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Any question on the exam about your interaction with stakeholders will 
require you to take the position of continuously and proactively influencing their engagement 
and expectations. In order to do this, you will require a stakeholder management plan. 
 Project Document Updates 
 The specific project  documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out the 
Plan Stakeholder Management process include the communications plan, stakeholder 
register, and any other document that refers to or relies on stakeholder engagement.

 1. 
  The Plan Stakeholder Management process seeks to take the 
information gathered in the stakeholder register and use this 
to develop a coherent stakeholder management plan that 
proactively manages and influences stakeholder engagement 
and expectations to ensure stakeholder support of the project 
and its objectives. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
456
 
 2. 
 The stakeholder management plan should build on the 
information contained in the stakeholder register and contain 
information about the current and expected engagement 
levels of key stakeholders, the communications requirements 
and methods selected for the stakeholders, and the particular 
strategies to be employed in managing their engagement and 
expectations. 
 
 3. 
 The stakeholder engagement assessment matrix shows the 
level of engagement of individual stakeholders in the project. 
 
 4. 
 The project management plan, which refers to all other areas 
of the project, is used as an input into the Plan Stakeholder 
Management process, because any information about 
stakeholders’ expectations, requirements, constraints, and 
engagement that may be included in the project management 
plan is essential in developing a robust stakeholder 
management plan.

 The Manage Stakeholder Engagement process is an executing process focused on 
the execution of the stakeholder management plan in order to ensure that stakeholder 
engagement and expectations are proactively influenced and managed. 
 
■ Exam Tip   By now you have seen the term  proactive several times, particularly in the 
stakeholder management area. In relation to managing stakeholder engagement, being 
proactive means continuously engaging stakeholders in an appropriate manner to get 
their support for the project and ensure that you understand and can meet their individual 
expectations of the project. Being proactive also means being on constant alert for any 
concerns that may arise and dealing with them in a manner that stops them from arising or, 
if they do arise, minimizes the adverse impact. 
 The Manage Stakeholder Engagement process covers the following executing 
 domain tasks :
• 
  Task 6: Manage the flow of information by following the 
communications plan, in order to keep stakeholders engaged and 
informed. 
• 
  Task 7: Maintain stakeholder relationships by following the 
stakeholder management plan, in order to receive continued 
support and manage expectations. 
 Inputs 
 The following inputs are used in the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process. 
 Stakeholder Management Plan 
 The key input into the Manage Stakeholder Engagement processes is the  stakeholder 
management plan , because it contains information about stakeholders, their ability to 
influence the project, their expectations, their level of engagement, and the documented 
strategies for proactively influencing all of these. The stakeholder management plan is an 
output from the Plan Stakeholder Management process.  
 Communications Management Plan 
 The  communications management plan is an essential input into the Manage 
Stakeholder Engagement process because it outlines individual stakeholders and 
the specific methods, frequency, and content of communication with them. Via the 
successful use of the information contained in the communications management 
plan, you can better execute the stakeholder management plan. The communications 
management plan is an output from the Plan Communications Management process. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
458
 Change Log 
 The  change log  is an important input to have available because you want to be able to 
convey to stakeholders any changes that have occurred. The change log is an output from 
the Perform Integrated Change Control process.

 The specific  organizational process assets that will be of use in the Manage Stakeholder 
Engagement process are any identified organizational communication methods, change 
control procedures, lessons learned, and historical information about similar previous 
projects and how they managed stakeholder engagement. 
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques of this process can be used on the separate inputs to 
deliver the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process outputs. 
 Communications Methods 
 The communications management plan outlines the specific methods and content 
of communication to be used for each stakeholder. As part of the  communications 
model and methods discussed in Chapter   8 , several methods of communication can 
assist you in managing stakeholder engagement. These methods include  interactive 
communication , which means all parties to the communication are involved in the 
exchange of ideas and messages. This is the most common form of communication 
for influencing stakeholders, and it relies on all parties involved in the communication 
having strong interpersonal skills. 
 Push communication is a one-way, sender-driven communications method 
where one party, the sender, sends information to the other party, the receiver, without 
necessarily checking that it has been received and interpreted correctly. E-mail messages, 
letters, and press releases are all examples of push communication. As a communication 
method, it can be a very effective means of distributing information quickly and widely if 
care is taken to craft the message well. 
 Pull communication occurs when information is posted so that recipients can visit 
and draw down the information at their leisure. Company or project intranet sites are 
good examples of pull communication.  
 
■ Exam Tip   After reading this section on managing stakeholder engagement, you may 
want to read the communications management chapter (Chapter   8  ) again, because the two 
subjects are very closely linked. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
459
 Interpersonal Skills 
 The process of managing stakeholders is based on building relationships, and the project 
manager’s interpersonal skills are a key tool used in establishing relationships. The types 
of interpersonal skills you will want to use include leadership skills, decision-making 
skills, conflict-resolution skills, change management skills, and active listening. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Interpersonal skills are also used as a tool in the Develop Project Team and 
Manage Project Team processes described in Chapter   7  . 
 Management Skills 
 In addition to the interpersonal skills already mentioned, a range of  management skills 
are more focused on directing and controlling stakeholders. These include presentation, 
negotiation, time management, and public speaking skills. 
 
REAL WORLD
 An artificial distinction is often made between management and leadership skills, 
somehow implying that they are separate and used individually. The reality is that as 
a project manager, you will need to develop both your leadership and management 
skills to high levels and use them concurrently, depending on the situation you are in 
and the outcomes you are seeking to achieve. 
 Outputs 
 The outputs from the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process include the following. 
 Issue Log 
 As you carry out the process of proactively managing stakeholder engagement, particular 
issues with individual stakeholders may arise that need to be documented so that they 
can be recorded and worked on. The best place to record these issues is the issue log. 
The issue log is used as an input into the Control Stakeholder Engagement process, the 
Manage Project Team process, and the Control Communications process.  

CHAPTER 11 ■ STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
460
 Change Requests 
 In addition to issues that may arise, there may also be change requests, including 
corrective or preventive actions, which need to be documented and assessed via the 
approved change-control process. Change requests are an input into the Perform 
Integrated Change Control process. 
 Project Management Plan Updates 
 The specific parts of the project management  plan that may be updated as a result 
of executing the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process include, obviously, the 
stakeholder management plan, as well as the communications management plan, the 
human resource management plan, and any other parts of the project management plan 
that are affected by stakeholder expectations and engagement. 
 Project Document Updates 
 The specific project  documents that may be updated are, obviously, the stakeholder 
register and any other documents specifically affected by stakeholder engagement issues. 
 Organizational Process Asset Updates 
 As a result of carrying out the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process, you may want 
to update your organizational process  assets : specifically, lessons learned, recording 
your experience in managing stakeholder engagement, and documents containing 
stakeholder feedback.

 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 The main purpose of the Manage Stakeholder Engagement 
process is the execution of the stakeholder management plan, 
in order to achieve stakeholder support for the project. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
461
 
 2. 
 The difference between push and pull forms of 
communication is in whether the information is sent to 
specific recipients. In push communication, information is 
sent from a sender to a recipient; and in pull communication, 
recipients have to access the information themselves.  
 
 3. 
  The issue log is a main output from the Manage Stakeholder 
Engagement process because, while executing the stakeholder 
management plan, you may identify particular issues 
with individual stakeholders that need to be recorded and 
documented in order to ensure that they are monitored and 
resolved. 
 
 4. 
  The Manage Stakeholder Engagement process uses the 
change log from the Perform Integrated Change Control 
process and the communications management plan from the 
Plan Communications Management process.

 The Control Stakeholder Engagement process is a monitoring and controlling 
process focused on examining the execution of the stakeholder management plan to 
ensure that it is being executed correctly and appropriately, and to determine whether it 
needs changing. 
 The Control Stakeholder Engagement process covers the following monitoring and 
controlling  domain task :
• 
 Task 1: Measure project performance using appropriate tools and 
techniques, in order to identify and quantify any variances and 
corrective actions. 
 Inputs 
 The following inputs are used in the Control Stakeholder Engagement process. 
 Project Management Plan 
 The  project management plan contains the stakeholder management plan and other 
plans and baselines useful for determining whether the stakeholder management plan 
is being executed correctly. The project management plan is an output from the Develop 
Project Management Plan process. 
 Issue Log 
 The  issue log describes all the issues raised by stakeholders; as such, it can be used to 
determine whether there are issues and, subsequently, whether expectations are being 
appropriately managed and dealt with. The issue log is an output from the Manage 
Stakeholder Engagement process. 
 Work Performance Data 
 Work performance data is required to enable you to assess whether the work you have 
been doing according to the stakeholder management plan is being carried out as 
planned. Work performance data is an output from the Direct and Manage Project Work 
process. 
 Project Documents 
 Several types of  project documents are useful in determining whether you are controlling 
stakeholder engagement as per the stakeholder management plan. Examples of relevant 
project documents include the stakeholder register, change log, communications register, 
and project schedule. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
463
 Tools and Techniques 
 The following tools and techniques of this process can be used on the separate inputs to 
deliver the Control Stakeholder Engagement process outputs. 
 Information Management Systems 
 A stakeholder-focused  information management system is a subset of the project 
management information system that allows for the documentation, distribution, and 
storage of information for and about stakeholders. The types of information that the 
information management system captures will reflect the particular interests of the 
stakeholders and may include information about any aspect of the project that can be 
measured and communicated, including information about project scope, cost, time, 
quality, risk, or any other relevant factor deemed of interest by stakeholders. 
 
REAL WORLD
 I have often found that there is a huge disparity between stakeholders when it 
comes to the types of project information they are interested in. Some stakeholders 
are interested in the traditional cost and time progress of a project, whereas others 
have no interest in these and are more interested in quality measures or issues 
specific to their interests. It is very important that the project manager determine 
what parts of the project are important to individual stakeholders. You also may 
need to control the amount of information that goes out to certain stakeholders. 
We had a particular stakeholder on one project who we knew was distributing 
project information to the media; because this stakeholder was a senior member 
of the project control group, he expected to have access to whatever information 
he desired. We had to ensure that he was only given the information he wanted 
as a member of the project control group and the same information everyone else 
received. 
 Expert Judgment 
 Expert judgment is a valuable tool that can be used in the Control Stakeholder 
Engagement process. You, as project manager, are one of these experts, as are members 
of your team. You may also choose to draw on the experience of senior management or 
experts with experience in effectively controlling stakeholder engagement. In addition, 
you may choose to draw on the expertise of key stakeholders themselves.      

CHAPTER 11 ■ STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
464
 Meetings 
 Meetings between the project manager, project team members, experts, and stakeholders 
are an excellent way of ensuring that stakeholder engagement levels are kept high. This 
will occur only if meetings are run appropriately and have the correct people attending 
for the right reasons. The types of information that may be exchanged at a meeting are 
status reports relating to project data that is of interest to the stakeholders.   
 Outputs 
 The outputs from the Control Stakeholder Engagement process are the following. 
 Work Performance Information 
 Given that  work performance data is an input into this process, you can expect that work 
performance information is an output. It refines and analyzes the raw work performance 
data so that it can be presented in an appropriate format and used for decision-making. 
 Change Requests 
 As a result of carrying out the Control Stakeholder Engagement process, you may discover 
a variance between what you planned to do and what is actually occurring, and that 
stakeholder engagement levels are not where you had planned for them to be. Thus, you 
may raise a change request, which could include changes to the stakeholder management 
plan or a recommendation for corrective or preventive actions. 
 Project Management Plan Updates 
 As a result of carrying out stakeholder management activities, changes can be made to 
any other plan that forms part of the  project management plan . This reflects the wide 
range of influences stakeholders have over the project. 
 Project Document Updates 
 The specific project  documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out the 
Control Stakeholder Engagement process include the stakeholder register and issue logs.  
 Organizational Process Asset Updates 
 As a result of carrying out the Control Stakeholder Engagement process, you may learn 
information that requires you to update organizational process  assets to ensure that 
they better reflect what you have discovered. Specific types of organizational process 
assets that may be updated include any templates or processes related to stakeholder 
engagement management, any project records collating feedback from stakeholders, and 
any lessons-learned documentation.

process? 
 
 4. 
  How does the Control Stakeholder Engagement process 
interact with other project management knowledge areas? 
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
  The main purpose of the Control Stakeholder Engagement 
process is to monitor overall levels of stakeholder engagement 
against what is expected and make changes to the stakeholder 
management plan and the strategies around stakeholder 
engagement.  
 
 2. 
  The issue log describes and documents individual issues 
raised by stakeholders. Therefore, using it as an input into 
the Control Stakeholder Engagement process allows you to 
view the number of issues, the complexity of issues, which 
stakeholders are raising issues, and whether the issues are 
being resolved to the satisfaction of stakeholders.  
 
 3. 
 The types of organizational process assets that may be 
updated as a result of the Control Stakeholder Engagement 
process include any existing processes and templates, project 
records relating to your stakeholder engagement strategies 
and results, and, of course, your collection of lessons-learned 
documentation. 
 
 4. 
  The Control Stakeholder Engagement process uses inputs 
from the Develop Project Management Plan process (the 
project management plan) and also the Direct and Manage 
Project Work process (work performance data).

 CHAPTER 12  
 Ethics and Professional 
Conduct 
 This chapter focuses on the topic of ethics and professional conduct, which describes the 
way a professional project manager is expected to act in many different situations. 
 
■ Exam Tip   The expected and accepted behaviors described in this chapter may differ 
from your own experience. It is important to remember that, for the exam, the behaviors 
described here are considered the correct way to act in any situation. 
 No explicit domain tasks are reflected in this section. Several years ago, there were 
distinct questions about ethics and professional situations in the PMP ®  exam. However, 
these questions have now been incorporated into the main body of questions and may 
lie hidden in a question that appears to be about estimating, risk, quality, customer 
relations, or any other topic. Thus it is very important that you read the question carefully 
to determine whether it is presenting a situation that requires you to specify how you 
would act ethically and professionally. 
 Although there are no domain tasks for this topic, there is the Code of Ethics and 
Professional Conduct from the  Project Management Institute (PMI) . Both mandatory 
and aspirational standards are captured in the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. 
The Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and the behavior of professional project 
management practitioners reflect the vales of responsibility, respect, fairness, and 
honesty. 
 The PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct applies to all members of the 
Project Management Institute. Additionally, it applies to nonmembers who hold a 
PMI certification, those who apply to commence a PMI certification process, and 
nonmembers who serve PMI in a volunteer capacity. Beyond these people, whom it 
directly applies to, it also serves as a guideline for all professional project management 
practitioners. 
 A breach of this code can result in an ethics complaint to the PMI, which has the 
ability to consider the complaint and take action against anyone found to have breached 
the code. 

CHAPTER 12 ■ ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
476
 
REAL WORLD
 I have always found that the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct serves as a 
very valuable reference to guide my decisions and behaviors in real-world situations 
where perhaps I might be tempted to act differently. It has also served as a guide 
to the behaviors I expect of other professional project managers. Keep in mind 
that sometimes the right course of action isn’t the easiest course of action. When 
considering what is best to do in an ethical situation, one approach is to look at the 
impact a bad decision would have on your professional and personal reputation and 
credibility. Always select an answer that will enhance your credibility and reputation. 
 Responsibility, Respect, Fairness, and Honesty 
 The four key foundational values for any project manager are responsibility, respect, 
fairness, and honesty. Although these may all seem to be fairly straightforward concepts 
that you think you both understand and apply consistently, you may not fully understand 
the implications and expected behaviors. Individually, they describe specific behaviors; 
collectively, they present a unified code by which any professional project manager can 
guide and assess their actions and the actions of others. Therefore, it is worth taking the 
time to investigate each one and review the specific actions and behaviors it demands of a 
professional project manager. 
 
■ Exam Tip   Take time when reading each question on the exam to determine whether it 
is presenting you with a technical situation or an ethical situation. If it is an ethical situation, 
then answer according to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. 
 Responsibility 
 
■ More Info   Responsibility 
 You can read more about responsibility in the Project Management Institute Code of Ethics 
and Professional Conduct. 
 Responsibility means being personally and professionally accountable for your 
own actions, being accountable for acting ethically and professionally at all times, and 
ensuring that others do the same.  Responsibility also means you as the project manager 
are responsible for the actions of those on your team. 

CHAPTER 12 ■ ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
477
 The mandatory standard of responsibility requires you to first make sure you know 
and uphold all the relevant policies, rules, regulations, and laws that govern your work, 
professional, and volunteer activities. If you disagree with any of these rules, you can seek 
to change them, but until they are changed you must abide by them. 
 Furthermore, you must always report unethical or illegal conduct to the appropriate 
people or body. This means whenever you discover or observe unethical or illegal behavior, 
you must report it to the appropriate authorities. If you discover someone on your project 
not dealing fairly or honestly with a stakeholder, you must report this to your project team 
or sponsor. Although your natural inclination may be to ignore the behavior if you regard it 
as minor, you must report it no matter how small it is. If the behavior is an ethical breach, 
you must report it to the PMI in accordance with the process on its web site. Make sure any 
complaints you file are substantiated by fact and documented appropriately. 
 You must also encourage people to do the same and neither retaliate yourself nor 
let others retaliate against any person who brings a breach of rules to the attention of the 
right person or body, or who files an ethical complaint. This is to encourage and support 
the role of the  whistleblower .  
 
REAL WORLD
 There will always be a temptation to avoid responsibility, but I have found that in 
addition to enhancing your professional reputation and credibility, the simple act 
of taking responsibility also contributes to your ongoing leadership development. 
Great leadership enhances the chances of project success, and being a great leader 
requires you to take responsibility and lead by example. 
 The aspirational standards of responsibility require you to make decisions and 
take subsequent actions based on the best interests of society, public safety, and the 
environment, not in your own best interests. The greater good of society, public safety, 
and the environment must always take precedence over self-interest. This means if a 
project you are working on conflicts with or adversely affects society, public safety, or the 
environment, you should reconsider whether the project is worth doing. 
 Taking responsibility also means accepting only project work that is consistent with 
your background, experience, technical and interpersonal skills, and qualifications. 
Don’t be tempted to exaggerate you own ability; only take on work that you know you 
are competent to do. After the work is taken on, you must make sure you fulfill the 
commitments and see them through to completion. 
 If you make mistakes, errors, or omissions, you must take responsibility, take 
ownership, and make corrections as soon as possible. If you discover errors or omissions 
made by others, you must communicate them to the appropriate body as soon they are 
discovered. Knowingly acting in error or with information you know is false is considered 
a breach of this standard. 
 Finally, taking responsibility means protecting the intellectual property rights, 
copyright, and confidential information of any person or body. This means if you are in a 
situation where you have the opportunity to use intellectual property of a previous client, 
you should always seek their approval first. Additionally, you should not allow anyone to 
break any copyright rules, laws, or regulations.  

CHAPTER 12 ■ ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
478
 
■ Exam Tip   If you discover anyone breaching these standards, you must report them to 
the relevant authority. So if you find someone breaking a company standard, you must report 
them within your organization. If you find someone breaking a PMI standard, you must 
report them to PMI; and if you find someone breaking the law, you must report them to the 
appropriate legal authorities.

 Respect 
 
■ More Info   Respect 
 You can read more about respect in the Project Management Institute Code of Ethics and 
Professional Conduct. 
 The value of  respect means having appropriate regard for yourself and for others, 
personally and professionally. It requires you to negotiate agreements and contracts 
in good faith and not exercise the power of your expertise or position to influence the 
decisions or actions of others in order to benefit personally at their expense. This doesn’t 

CHAPTER 12 ■ ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
479
mean you can’t influence people, because that is a key skill in stakeholder management 
and communications activities. It means you can’t seek to benefit personally by taking 
advantage of others using your position of power. 
 Respect also means not acting in an abusive manner toward any other person. 
Keep in mind that abuse can take many forms, from outright verbal and physical abuse 
to the more insidious forms of gossip, slander, libel, and passive-aggressive behavior. 
Complying with this standard means observing the golden rule of treating others as you 
would like to be treated. 
 In addition, respect means you respect the property rights of others, which ties in 
nicely with the value of responsibility and protecting the intellectual property rights, 
copyright, and confidential information of any person or body. This means you must 
acknowledge the ownership and copyright that others hold on their work. 
 Demonstrating respect also means being aware of the norms and customs of 
others and avoiding engaging in behaviors they might consider disrespectful. This is 
increasingly important in an ever-more globalized economy, where projects are often 
done internationally. Many stakeholders may have different customs from your own, and 
effective communication and management of stakeholders requires you to understand 
their customs and treat them with respect. A key element in effective communications 
with and managing the expectations of stakeholders is the ability to listen to others’ 
points of view and seek to understand them.  
 When it comes to resolving conflicts or disagreements, respect means dealing 
directly and in an open manner with those people with whom you have a conflict or 
disagreement. Seek to deal with the issue and not let personalities get in the way. 
 Whatever happens around you, and whatever the actions of others, respect also 
means you always conduct yourself in a professional manner, even when it is not 
reciprocated. 
 
REAL WORLD
 I have always found that having respect for myself and for others is a significant 
personal asset. It improves my ability to build genuine relationships with others and 
understand their point of view. Keep in mind that people will know, either consciously 
or subconsciously, if you are faking respect, so make sure it is always genuine.

  If you are working in another country and it is a commonly 
accepted practice to pay bribes to get project work done, what 
should you do? 

CHAPTER 12 ■ ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
 In any negotiations, you should seek to get an agreement that 
both parties can live with. You should not negotiate contracts if 
you have no intention of honoring them. 
 
 2. 
 This is a tricky question. You know that you should always respect 
the culture and customs of others, but taking precedence over this 
is the requirement that you should always obey the laws of the 
country in which you are working. If bribery is illegal, it doesn’t 
matter what the custom is—you simply do not participate in it.      
 Fairness 
 
■ More Info   Fairness 
 You can read more about fairness in the Project Management Institute Code of Ethics and 
Professional Conduct. 
 The value of  fairness deals with conflict of interest, favoritism, and discrimination. 
 A  conflict of interest situation arises when your own personal interest may conflict 
with the interest of your employer, or you may derive personal benefit from an action 
undertaken on behalf of another person. Conflict of interest can be both real and 
perceived. Whether it is real or perceived, it should always be fully and openly disclosed 
as early as possible so that it can be dealt with in an appropriate manner. You should not 
participate in any process or project until the disclosure has been made and a decision 
has been made about the best way to move forward. 
 Conflict of interest situations can also arise as a result of the business dealings of 
family members or friends, when they have professional or business connections to your 
project. In this case, your relationship should always be fully disclosed.  
 
REAL WORLD
 Many organizations keep a documented conflict-of-interest register where all 
employees must disclose and record any real or potential conflicts of interest. 
Often the level of conflict of interest is so small that it can be managed via simple 
disclosure; at other times, it may require those affected to be removed from a 
particular process or project. Always disclose any real or perceived conflict of 
interest quickly. 

CHAPTER 12 ■ ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
481
 The value of fairness also extends to favoritism and discrimination. To display 
fairness, you must avoid both favoritism and discrimination, which means you neither 
hire nor fire, neither reward nor punish, and neither award nor deny contracts based on 
your own personal considerations, bias, or benefit. This means you should treat everyone 
equally and fairly, regardless of any preconceived notions you may have. It also means 
you must not discriminate against anyone based on gender, race, age, religion, disability, 
nationality, or sexual orientation. 
 In order to show and prove fairness, you must be able to demonstrate transparency 
and impartiality in your decision-making process and provide equal access to 
information to those who are authorized to have that information. This is particularly 
important in legal or contractual matters, because a lack of fairness could be grounds for 
a legal challenge to your decisions.

 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
  If you, a friend, or a family member could benefit, or is perceived 
to benefit, from a commercial transaction in which you are 
involved, there is a real or potential conflict of interest. It must 
first be fully disclosed, and you should not take part in any 
process until it is resolved. 
 
 2. 
  You should treat everyone involved in procurement negotiations 
fairly and equally. Everyone should receive exactly the same 
information at the same time. 
 Honesty 
 
■ More Info   Honesty 
 You can read more about honesty in the Project Management Institute Code of Ethics and 
Professional Conduct. 
 Honesty seems like a self-evident term. We all know when we are being honest, and 
if we aren’t being honest, then surely we are being dishonest. Or is there some grey area 
between honesty and dishonesty? 

CHAPTER 12 ■ ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
482
 If you want to act in accordance with the value of honesty, there is no grey area; 
you are being either honest or dishonest. Telling half-truths or omitting key information 
is dishonest. In order to meet the standards required by this value, you must be 100% 
honest at all times. This means you, as a professional project manager, will not engage in 
or condone in others behavior that is designed to deceive anyone. This includes making 
misleading or false statements, telling half-truths, providing information out of context, 
or omitting information that, if known, would make your statements misleading or 
incomplete. 
 The value of honesty also ties in with the values of responsibility, respect, and 
fairness, and demands of you that you do not engage, condone, or participate in 
dishonest behavior with the intention of personal gain or at the expense of another.  
 
■ Exam Tip   If you are ever presented with a question that asks you what is best to do 
in a situation where you suspect dishonesty, the answer is always to disclose this and then 
investigate and rectify the situation with honesty. 
 Displaying honesty means being prepared to ensure that the information you are 
basing decisions on or providing to others is accurate, reliable, and timely. Being honest 
also means being prepared to share bad news even when it may be poorly received. 
 
REAL WORLD
 Being honest will sometimes have repercussions that test your skill as a relationship 
builder and influencer. You may even lose some credibility in the short term. But over 
the long term, you will develop a reputation based on honesty, and this will serve 
you better than a reputation of being someone who isn’t always honest. 
 Displaying the value of honesty also means you only make promises you can keep, 
and you keep the promises you make. By leading the way and acting honestly at all times, 
you will create a culture that encourages and expects honesty at all times. Ultimately, your 
reputation and credibility will be enhanced by sticking to this value at all times.

CHAPTER 12 ■ ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
483
 Quick Check Answers 
 
 1. 
  In order to be honest, you must openly share all information that 
you have. Communicating half-truths and omissions about the 
status of your project to buy time to fix the problems is dishonest.  
 
 2. 
  This question relates not only to the value of honesty, but also 
to responsibility, fairness, and respect. You have a duty to not 
continue the negotiations until the future of the project is 
decided, and to inform the vendor of the reasons. 
 Chapter Summary

personal and professional responsibility for their own actions, 
acting ethically and professionally at all times, and ensuring that 
others do the same.

  The key value of respect requires professional project managers 
to display respect for themselves and others. It requires that they 
refrain from abusive behaviors and understand different customs 
and cultures. 
• 
  The key value of fairness seeks to avoid either real or potential 
conflict-of-interest situations and avoid favoritism and 
discrimination by treating everyone equally and openly.

of interest and seek advice on how best to manage it. 
 
 4. 
 Correct Answer: C 
 A. 
 Incorrect: You cannot pay the bribe because it is illegal, 
and lodging a complaint with officials will not make it 
okay to pay the bribe.

with the meeting. 
 B. 
 Correct: This answer presents the most honest approach 
to dealing with the situation. 
 C. 
 Incorrect: This would be dishonest. 
 D. 
 Incorrect: Cancelling the meeting without explanation is 
not the best option because you should be honest about 
the reason for the cancellation.

it is an illegal copy. 
 C. 
 Correct: Your only option here is to refuse her offer and 
then report her illegal activity.

 A. 
 Incorrect: This situation is an example of a real or 
potential conflict of interest; as such, it must first be 
disclosed before the project can proceed. 
 B. 
 Incorrect: When the conflict of interest has been 
disclosed, you would not be able to give your parents any 
special information. 
 C. 
 Correct: Because this is either a real or potential conflict 
of interest, you must disclose it first. 
 D. 
 Incorrect: It doesn’t matter whether you benefit from 
it directly; your actions could benefit a member of your 
family, and thus there is a conflict of interest.      
 
 10. 
 Correct Answer: C 
 A. 
 Incorrect: This situation requires you to be clear about the 
role you have. You would have to clearly separate your PMI

 CHAPTER 13  
 Eligibility, Study, and 
Exam-Taking Tips 
 Here are some eligibility, study, and exam-taking tips you may find useful. 
 Eligibility 
 Before studying for and taking the PMP ® examination, you need to first check whether you 
are eligible to take it. Full eligibility criteria can be found at the PMI ® web site (   www.pmi.org  ); 
check this web site to ensure the following information is up to date. 
 PMP Prerequisites 
 If you have a secondary degree (high school diploma, associate’s degree, or the global 
equivalent):
• 
  7,500 hours leading and directing projects, spanning at least 5 
years in total, within the last 8 years 
• 
 35 hours of project management education 
 or, if you have a four-year degree (university degree or baccalaureate equivalent):
• 
  4,500 hours leading and directing projects, spanning at least 3 
years in total, within the last 8 years 
• 
 35 hours of project management  education 
 Study Tips 
• 
 Visit    www.vark-learn.com  to find out how you study best, and 
adapt your study techniques to suit. 
• 
 Set aside time each week to study. 

CHAPTER 13 ■ ELIGIBILITY, STUDY, AND EXAM-TAKING TIPS 
496
• 
 Plan your study so you know which sections you are studying.  
• 
 Complete all the Quick Check questions, chapter exercises, and 
review questions in this book. 
• 
 Figure out the areas you are weakest in, and focus extra attention 
on them. 
• 
 Ask someone to listen to you explain difficult concepts in 
your own words. If you can’t explain it, you probably don’t 
understand it. 
• 
 Form study groups with other candidates, and learn from each 
other. 
• 
 Ask for patience from workmates, family, and friends as you focus 
on your study. It does require a bit of effort, and you may strain 
some relationships. 
• 
 Use a commercial training provider that has courses specifically 
designed to help you pass the exam. We strongly recommend 
that you look for a PMI Registered Education Provider ® (R.E.P.) to 
ensure you are getting a quality trainer. 
• 
 Lock in your exam date—nothing focuses your mind like having a 
deadline to meet. 
 Exam-Taking Tips  
• 
 Visit the testing center before the day you have booked the exam 
so you know where it is and where you will park.  
• 
 Be early—allow enough time to relax. 
• 
 Take the required forms of identification as per the confirmation 
e-mail PMI sends you. If you don’t do this, you will not be allowed 
into the exam testing center. 
• 
 Take some water and some easy-to-eat food. You will not be 
allowed to take this in to the test center, but you should be able to 
store it in a locker and access it during the 4 hours—remember, 
your exam time doesn’t stop if you take a break. 
• 
 Don’t panic! It’s normal to feel some stress, but don’t let it 
negatively affect your performance. 
• 
 Answer all the questions. No points are deducted for wrong 
answers. 

CHAPTER 13 ■ ELIGIBILITY, STUDY, AND EXAM-TAKING TIPS 
497
• 
  Use any remaining time to recheck answers—there are no points 
for leaving early. 
• 
  Check your progress throughout the exam. At the 1-hour mark, 
you should have answered about 40 questions. At the 2-hour 
mark, you should have answered about 90 questions. At the 
3-hour mark, you should have answered about 150 questions.     
 Question-Answering Tips  
• 
 Read each question fully. 
• 
  Reread the question! Seriously, many mistakes are made because 
people don’t read the questions fully. 
• 
  Read all four answers before deciding which one is correct. 
Sometimes the first one looks really good, and you may be 
tempted to mark it as correct when a better answer is further 
down the list. 
• 
  Eliminate any obviously wrong answers.  
• 
  Place the answers on a spectrum of most right to most wrong, and 
choose the most-right one. 
• 
  Organize the answers in order of which would be done first to 
the one that would be done last, and choose the one you would 
do first. 
• 
 If all else fails, guess! Leave no question unanswered.
