Deﬁnitions and Examples
Deﬁnition 1.1.1. A binary operation ∗on a set S is a function from S × S
into S. (S, ∗) is then called a binary structure.
Deﬁnition 1.1.2. Let ∗be a binary operation on a nonempty set S.
∗is associative
if

∀a, b, c ∈S

e ∗x = x = x ∗e
∀x ∈S.
Deﬁnition 1.1.3. A binary structure (S, ∗) is called a semigroup if ∗is asso-

if for each a ∈G, there is b ∈G such that
a ∗b = e = b ∗a.
This element b is called an inverse of a.
Remark. It is customary to denote a group (G, ∗) by its underlying set G and
x ∗y by xy if there is no ambuguity.

Deﬁnition 1.1.5. The order of a group G is the cardinality of the set G and
denoted |G|.
Deﬁnition 1.1.6. A group (G, ∗) is a abelian if ∗is commutative (ie. a ∗b =

Deﬁnition 3.1.1. A permutation on a nonempty set X is a bijection on X.
The set S(X) of all permutations on X is a group under composition, called the
symmetric group on X.
Any subgroup of S(X) is called a permutation
group on X.
Remark. If sets A and B have the same cardinality, then S(A) ∼= S(B). When
X is ﬁnite, S(X) can be consider as the symmetric group on {1, 2, . . . , n}. It will
be denoted by Sn, called the symmetric group of degree n. The order of Sn

in {1, 2, . . . , n} satisfying
(i) σ(ai) = ai+1 for all i ∈{1, 2, . . . , r −1},
(ii) σ(ar) = a1, and
(iii) σ(x) = x otherwise
r is then the length of the cycle.
σ will be denoted by (a1, a2, . . . , ar) and
sometimes refered to as r-cycle.
Remarks.
(i) The identity permutation is the only cycle of length 1 and will be denoted
(1).
(ii) (a1, a2, . . . , ar) = (b1, b2, . . . , bs) iﬀr = s and there exists t such that bi = at+i

of transposition.
Theorem 3.4.2. If a permutation α is a product of an even number of transpo-
sitions, then every decomposition of α into a product of transpositions must have

odd number of transpositions is called an odd permutation.
