Preface
Humanity always operates in conditions of incomplete information.
-Valentin Valentinovich Novozhilov
This book focuses on the study of extreme waves. Their formation can significantly 
change properties of the medium within the wave; that is, a phase state of the medium 
may be changed. Very often these waves threaten the strength of the medium or the 
existence of technical systems.
The presented here theory is based on conservation and state equations of con-
tinuum media. Cases are considered when these equations may be simplified to the 
dynamic theory of shells or to strongly nonlinear wave equations in gas, liquid, and 
solid media, bubbly liquids, and some gassy materials. Thus, the presented theory 
demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of the waves under the investigation. 
In particular, we want to show that the emergence and evolution of many extreme 
waves are determined by similar physical mechanisms.
This book examines the reaction of structural elements and space objects to the 
dynamic actions of different durations and intensities. The load is carried out by 
pulses of pressure, heat, radiation, or mass.
Much attention is paid to cases of shock loading of shells containing water or liq-
uefied gas. The effects of cavitation in the water and cold boiling of cryogenic liquids 
on the formation of extreme waves inside the shell are studied. It is shown that both 
cavitation and cold boiling can decisively affect both the strength of structures and 
the possibility of their beneficial functioning. In particular, the reaction of plates and 
shells contacting with a liquid to an explosion is studied. The main attention is paid 
to studying the influence of cavitation, geometric and physical nonlinearity of shells 
on their strength, and the formation of extreme waves in the liquids. The influence 
of plastic deformations, large displacements, and reinforcing elements on the wave 
deformation of the structural elements is studied also. In particular, the effect of the 
elastoplastic properties of the material on the dynamic behavior of such structures, in 
particular on the possibility of the so-called counterintuitive behavior (CIB) of plates 
and shallow shells, is studied.
Then, the extreme waves excited by very short impact of heat, radiation, or mass 
are studied. In these cases, thermomechanical behavior of the material during the 
action of the impact loading, in many respects, is determined by the time and the 
action amplitude. These parameters determine the temperature and pressure a rising 
in the material (matter) and, consequently, the phase state of the matter within 
extreme waves. Processes of melting and evaporation, the heat propagation, and the 
emergence of fracture (spalling) are considered independently when the influence of 
them on extreme waves is studied.
Using the indicated approximations, this book examined a wide range of prob-
lems from extreme heat waves in cryogenic liquids and in metal targets perforated 
by projectiles or laser beams to the use of lasers to ensure life on Earth. In particular, 

xiv
Preface
recommendations are given for optimizing the pulsed laser action on dangerous 
space objects to ensure the fragmentation of them or the change their orbits.
Developed theoretical approaches are supplemented by experimental data. Much 
attention is paid to the experimental study of CIB of structural elements and to waves 
of melting in front of a massive perforator. The formation and amplification of non-
linear heat waves in liquid He II is illustrated also by our calculations.
This book is devoted to a very relevant and rapidly developing field of science, 
in which the problems of mechanics and physics of high energies and pressures are 
closely related. The field is so vast that its full consideration in one book is impos-
sible. By virtue of this, only some problems from their vast spectrum are considered 
which the author was directly interested with. The choice of material reflects the 
level of knowledge of the author and his personal tastes. The author apologizes to 
those scientists whose results are not reflected in this book. The author thanks for the 
contribution of all those outstanding scientists and authors of scientific articles and 
books, results of which have been used in this book.
This book was written for Master’s and PhD students as well as for researchers 
and engineers in the fields of thermal fluids, aerospace, nuclear engineering, and 
nonlinear wave studies.

I thank the University of Auckland and the Department of Mechanical Engineering 
that provided me with conditions for independent scientific work. The results of this 
20-year work are presented in this book.
I thank my scientific teacher Professor Ilgamov Marat Aksanovich, as well as 
Professors Ganiev R.F. and Nigmatullin R.I. (the Academy of Science of Russia). 
They have largely determined the research directions presented in this book. I want 
to recall with the deep gratitude of Professors Novozhilov V.V. (the former Academy 
of Science of USSR), Pisarenko G.S. (the former Academy of Science of USSR), and 
my friend Sakhabutdinov Zh.M. (the former Academy of Science of USSR). They 
supported all my scientific beginnings.
It is my great pleasure to acknowledge my friends—Professors Fakirov S. (the 
University of Auckland, New Zealand), Lazarev V.A. (Kuban State University, 
Russia), and Akhmediev N. (the Australian National University). The support and 
attention of them were very important for both beginning and completing the writ-
ing of this book. 
This book was written using some results of my students and colleagues—Drs. 
Abdirashidov A., Astanin V.V., Ivashchenko K.B., Karshiev A.B., Nechitailo N.V., 
Romashchenko V.A., Skurlatov E.D., and Zhurakhovskii V.S. (the former Academy 
of Science of USSR). I thank all of them. 
Finally, I am grateful for the contribution of all those outstanding scientists whose 
results were used in the book. I apologize to those whose valuable results are not 
reflected in this book. This is due to the limited volume of the book and the fact 
that the author tried to present a well-defined, unified vision of the problem under 
consideration.

Part I
Basic Models, Equations, 
and Ideas
Fear of the possibility of error should not turn us away from the search for truth.
Claude-Adrien Helvetius
Mechanics of continuous matter is a section of mechanics, devoted to the study of the 
motion and equilibrium of gases, liquids, plasmas, and deformable solids; it is subdi-
vided into hydro-air-mechanics, gasdynamics, elasticity theory, plasticity theory, etc.
The basic assumption of continuum mechanics is that matter can be considered as 
continuous medium, neglecting its molecular (atomic) structure. The  distribution 
of all characteristics (density, stresses, particle velocities, etc.) of matter is also 
 continuous. These assumptions make it possible to apply in mechanics of a  continuous 
medium, a well-developed theory of continuous functions and corresponding differ-
ential  equations. Indeed, the dimensions of the molecules are negligibly small in 
 comparison with the particle sizes that are considered in theoretical and experimen-
tal studies in mechanics of continuous medium.
The mechanics of a continuous medium is based on equations of motion, from the 
basic laws of mechanics, on the equation of the continuity of the medium, which is 
the consequence of law of conservation of mass, and on the equation of conservation 
of energy.
The characteristics of each particular medium are taken into account by the 
so-called state equations. They describe for a given medium dependences from 
stresses,  pressure, temperature, and other physical and chemical parameters. The 
mechanics of a continuous medium is used in various fields of physics and technology.

1 Models of Continuum
In this chapter, certain relationships of the mechanics of continuum, solid deformed 
body, and fluid as well as the theory of plates and shells are given. Equations of state 
are introduced, which are valid over a wide range of changes in the thermodynamic 
parameters of different media.
1.1  THE SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS OF MECHANICS 
CONTINUOUS MEDIUM
Equations of the continuum include the conservation equations, kinematic (geo-
metric) equations, and state (closing) equations. We present these equations in their 
general form, using tensor and vector notations. For definiteness, we assume that 
the motion of the medium is studied in Euler’s coordinates. The designations used 
basically correspond to the books [1,2] where the equations are written in Einstein 
notation.

tinuum includes the equation of conservation of mass

Five equations (1.1), (1.2), (1.7) contain, if we take into account (1.5), (1.8) and 
σ ij = σ ji, 15 unknowns: ρ, v , p, sij, E, W. Nonconformity of the number of these 
equations and the unknowns is natural since conservation laws describe the most 
fundamental properties of the medium. Individual features of specific materials, flu-
ids, and gases are described by additional differential and algebraic equations [2–8].
State equations [1,2]. We deal with cases when properties of a small-volume medium 
are completely determined by expressions p, sij, E, and W in terms of the components 
of the strain rate tensor eαβ, the components of the metric tensor gαβ, the temperature T, 
and some additional parameters x1, x2,…, xn varying from problem to problem:

where εαβ are the components of infinitesimal deformations corresponding to the dis-

are supplemented by 14 equations (1.10). A closed system of equations is obtained for 
finding 19 unknowns: ρ, v, p, sij, E, W. The system is simplified slightly, if we assume 
sij = s ji. The components gαβ and the parameters xn are considered as known values.
The second law of thermodynamics. Relations (1.10) cannot be arbitrary. They 
must not contradict the second thermodynamics law, thus ensuring production or at 
least conservation of the entropy. In the vast majority of important cases, Eqs. (1.10) 
automatically satisfy this condition. Therefore, we will not discuss Eq. (1.4) additionally.
Examples of the state equations. We give examples of the state equations for W, 
p, and E, which are valid for continuous media regardless of whether in solid, liquid, 
or gaseous states they are.

where pρ and Eρ are the elastic components that equal to the pressure and 
the internal energy of matter at zero degrees Kelvin; pT and ET are the ther-
mal components determined by the vibrations of lattice atoms; pe and Ee are 
the electronic components characterizing the contribution of the electron 
gas in p and E; Eu determines the contribution of the ionization component 
energy. When writing (1.14), we assumed independence of interatomic elas-
ticity from lattice vibrations and motion of electrons [3]. Consequently, the 
changes in pρ and Eρ are not connected with heating of the matter, while the 
changes in remaining terms in (1.14) are associated with an increase in tem-
perature. Thus, the same pressure can exist in a non-heated deformed body 
and in a heated, but undeformed matter. Therefore, the specific form for the 
terms in (1.14) must be established during force and thermal experiments.
Following [4], we write the expressions for the terms in (1.14):

Here the following notations are used: Λ is the volumetric heat of sublimation, b 
is the electronic heat capacity calculated for the degenerate gas, I is the ionization 
potential, NA is Avogadro’s constant, and γ  is the Grüneisen parameter. These val-
ues for some media are presented in [4–7]. The constants m, n, γ , l, k, and a in 
(1.15)–(1.23) are determined for each medium separately.
The pressure and the elastic component of the energy presented in forms (1.15) 
and (1.18) qualitatively correctly describe the form of the zero isotherm. In particu-
lar, work of expansion of matter from normal density to zero coincides with the heat 
of sublimation for all the materials considered in paper [4]. There the comparison 
of data of experiments and formula (1.15) was made. Satisfactory description of the 
elastic pressure component (up to double compression) for some metals was found.
The interpolation formula (1.19) of the thermal component of energy provides 
asymptotic values of the molar heat capacity for an ideal gas c = 3
v
2 R and a con-
densed state cv = 3R. The multiplier in the formula for the thermal pressure (1.16) 
has the corresponding asymptotes 3
2 and γ .
The interpolation equation for the electronic component (1.20) at high density 
and relatively low temperatures transforms into the known formula for the internal 
energy of degenerate electron gas:

(1.25)
Thus, Formula (1.20) covers a very wide range of parameters. However, the formula 
is unsuitable for the case of a low-temperature plasma of low density.
By virtue of their generality, Eqs. (1.15)–(1.23) cannot claim on high accuracy of 
description of matter properties. Moreover, the most part of the domain described 
by the equations, in general, is not experimentally investigated. In those parameter 
ranges, where the properties of metals have been studied, the experimental data are 
satisfactorily described by the equations obtained. In particular, the discrepancy 
of experimental and calculated pressure, density, and energy of liquid and gas on 
binodal does not exceed 10%. We note that the value of parameter γ , which is the 
Grüneisen coefficient for normal conditions, is close to experimental values for all 
13 metals considered in [4].
Let us describe by the thermal equation (1.14) the regularities of the change in 
the parameters ρ, p, and T. Results of numerical study of this equation for aluminum 
are presented in Figure 1.1(a). It can be seen that the isotherms do not change when 
temperature increases from zero to critical value. They are parallel to density axis in 
the region of the gaseous state of matter testing a break on the line R, which defines 
the boiling boundary.

8
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
With a further increase in temperature, the break of the isotherms is not observed, 
and with increasing density, the isotherms approach the phase boundary melting. 
Note that the resulting phase diagram for aluminum agrees well with those presented 
in other publications [5].
Let us give certain understanding about zones of predominant influence of the 
terms of the thermal equation (1.14). The results are shown in Figure 1.1(b) in the 
plane for ρ and T. The arrows indicate the zones that limit the curves corresponding 
to not less than 50% of the contribution of one or the other terms to the total pressure. 
A solid curve defines the zone of predominant influence py; dashed and dash-dotted 
curves define the zones of not less than 50% of the influence pT and pe, respectively.
Thus, we briefly discussed the equations for W, p, and T (1.10). The region of 
applicability of the first Eq. (1.10) is less extensive. In particular, the contribution 
of this equation in the behavior of a continuous medium decreases with increasing 
temperature or pressure. Therefore, this equation is usually determined in less cases 
of general models of continuum: solid deformable body and fluid.

where λ  and µ are the Lamé constants. Thus, problems of the elasticity can be solved 
using Eqs. (1.2), (1.5), and (1.26) if Fi = 0 and ρ = const (according to the approach of 
continuum mechanics), or using Eq. (1.27) written in terms of the displacements. The 
latter approach usually allows us to solve problems more easily.
Theory of plastic flow [8,12–15]. Hooke’s law is valid for relatively small defor-
mations (elastic deformations). During a further loading, many structural materials 
exhibit plastic properties. Plastic deformation takes place only after the elastic limit 
is exceeded. It is easy to determine a value of the stress when plastic properties begin 
to appear, in the case of simple loads, for example, from experiments with stretching 
of cylindrical specimens. The magnitude of the stress when plastic properties begin 
to appear is denoted as σ 0 (Figure 1.2).
Stress–strain tensile diagram consists of three parts (Figure 1.2(a)). In the first 
part, σ ≤σ 0. It is an elastic part that is characterized by the angle E (Young’s modu-
lus). In the second (elastic–plastic) part, σ 0 <
<
σ
σ N. This part is characterized by 
the angle E1 and the flow curve (see curve 2 in Figure 1.2(b)). The pores begin to 
form in ductile materials if σ  is near σ N. Pores coalesce if the strain continues to 
grow. Thus, the cracks are formed. This process corresponds to the third part of the 
stress–strain tensile diagram. As a result of growth of the cracks, the materials can 
be fragmented (see, also, Figure 2.1).
Of course, the transition of an elastic state to a plastic state is complicated in 
cases of a complex stress state. During the nineteenth century and the beginning of 
the twentieth century, many experimental studies of the plastic behavior of the body 
during complex loadings were made and a number of criteria for the transition of the 
elastic state to the plastic state were formulated [13,14]. The criterion for such a tran-
sition should be based on the stress state, which may be obtained from the simplest 
experiments. In this case, this approach can be accepted for engineering purposes.

where σ i is the intensity of the stresses characterizing the resistance of a material

kj kj . Consequently, the appearance of plastic flow is 
primarily associated with the deviator of the stress tensor. It is determined by the 
first equation of Eqs. (1.10). The value of σ 0 depends on the temperature; that is, it 
will be high in high-temperature region. With increasing T, this value falls and the 
effect of strength properties (elasticity, plasticity) on behavior material is reduced. 
In many cases, σ 0 is also dependent on the attained stress state, the loading rate, and 
sometimes the pressure p.
Thus, there is the condition (1.28) determining approximately the boundary of 
plasticity zones in a deformable material. Hooke’s equations become inapplicable 
there. It is necessary to correct Hooke’s equations within these zones.
There are many different theories having different accuracy and generality 
describing the behavior of plastic material. Let us describe two simple models of 
the plastic body, fairly widespread in the practice of dynamic calculations. They are 
valid, in general, for small elastic and plastic deformations.
Ideal plasticity. This model is determined in Figure 1.2(a) by the constant E and 
dashed line σ = σ 0 (flow rule). It is assumed that in the Mises condition (1.28), the 
value σ 0 does not depend on the value of the attained stress state. The value σ 0 is 
the constant of material. Plastic deformations begin to grow without limit when σ i 
increases till σ 0. The material is elastic when σ i < σ 0.
Flow plasticity theory. In contrast with the ideal model, this model takes into 
account a hardening law for the material.
It is assumed that the total strain in a body can be decomposed into an elastic part 
and a plastic part. The elastic part of the strain can be computed according to the 
elastic model. However, the plastic part of the strain is needed a special law.
The theory of plastic flow establishes a connection between infinitesimal incre-
ments of deformations dεkj and stresses dσ kj, the stress–strain state, and some 
parameters. The theory allows us to take into account the possibility of unloading, 
secondary plastic deformations, and loading complexity.
The initial assumptions of the following version of the theory are as follows: the 
body is isotropic; the relative change in volume is insignificant, and an elastic defor-
mation is proportional to the pressure εii = −3Kpe; full increments of the components 
of dεkj are a sum of the increments of the components of the elastic deformation dε e
kj 
and plastic deformation dε p

where dλ is an infinitesimal scalar value (a hardening parameter). Obviously, during 
loading and plastic deformation, dλ > 0, while during unloading and elastic defor-
mation, dλ = 0. Let us express dλ in terms of quantities, characterizing the stress–
strain state of the material.
For this, we substitute (1.30) into the expression for the intensity of plastic 
 deformation increments:

the flow plasticity theory contain both finite and infinitesimals values and are valid 
only on small intervals of plastic deformation. In view of this, sufficiently precise 
solutions of complex elastic–plastic problems are possible only with the help of the 
step-by-step procedure [15].
We divide the loading time by J small steps. The increments of plastic deforma-
tion in expression (1.29) at the step n (n = 1, 2,…, N,…J), we denote by the index n. 
Let us consider the loading step N.

State equations (1.34) differ from those written for elastic body (1.26) by terms that 
take into account the accumulated plastic deformation. After their determination, the 
problem is analogous to the problem of elastic theory. The main problem is to estab-
lish these terms at each step of solving the equations. These terms can be determined 
using the iteration method (Figure 1.3).

Let us dwell briefly on one of the possible schemes determining ∆nε p

trary loading step N+1. We assume that the accumulated plastic deformation and all 
the remaining quantities at the Nth step are known.

From the expressions obtained above for skj, Eqs. (1.26) and (1.34) can be considered 
as the simplest state equations describing elastic and plastic deformation of the material.
Thus, in the last two sections, we gave the basic equations of the continuum and a 
number of variants of the state equations.
1.3  THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION AND THE WIDE-RANGE 
EQUATIONS OF STATE OF AN INVISCID FLUID
In the case of a viscous liquid, the components of the stress deviator (1.10) are usu-
ally determined by the Navier–Stokes law. The model of inviscid (ideal) fluid is 
based on the assumption that in (1.10), sij = 0. Different versions of model of the

and for ductile metals [15].

where p0 and ρ0 are the pressure and density of undisturbed fluid, respectively; k is 
the adiabatic exponent for liquid; and B is a constant. Equations (1.34) are valid for 
water at pressures lower than 3.103 MPa.
For the normal temperature, k = 7.15 and B = 304.5 MPa. It is emphasized that 
Eq. (1.36) does not depend on the temperature. In this case, equations of hydrody-
namics reduce to a system of Eqs. (1.1), (1.2), (1.5), and (1.36). We emphasize that 
Eq. (1.36) is also valid for certain gas if B = 0. Thus, (1.34) is an example of the 
simple equation describing states of two media.
Ways of simplifying the equations. Formulas (1.26), (1.34), and (1.36) provide 
the important way of simplifying the mathematical formulation of problems that is 
connected with assumptions about the form of the state equations (1.10).
	
1. Further simplification of the equations of hydrodynamics is possible while 
introducing an assumption about the nature of fluid flow. Let us consider 
the irrotational flow. This assumption allows us to introduce the velocity 
potential ψ  [15–17]:

We introduce (1.37) into the equation of motion (1.2), which is rewritten tak-
ing into account (1.5) and Fi = 0. Eliminating the operation ∇, we obtain 
the Cauchy–Lagrange integral:

In (1.41), c2

Thus, using particularities of the flow, one can essentially simplify the 
mathematical formulation of the hydrodynamic problem. In the derivation 
of (1.41), no assumption was made about the magnitude of the perturbations 
in the liquid. Consequently, the application of Eqs. (1.41) is limited only by 
Tait’s equation (1.36), which is valid up to p ≤

Despite the limitations in amplitude, the equations of acoustics allow 
us to consider the propagation, reflection, and interaction of waves of suf-
ficiently high intensity.
It is recommended in [18–20] to use the acoustic approximation up to 
35, 50, and 110 Mpa, correspondingly. Our calculations of nonstation-
ary interaction of liquid with deformable boundaries show that acoustic 
approach can ensure a good accuracy of the calculations for more high 
pressures (up to 300 MPa), if acoustic conditions are not met only in 
individual small volumes of the liquid during small time intervals [21]. 
Thus, approaches based on Tait’s equation (1.36) allow us to calculate 
pressure waves of the considerable amplitude. Let us consider the disad-
vantages of Eq. (1.36). They are determined by the fact that (1.36) does 
not describe the behavior of the liquid at relatively low pressures, when 
the liquid approaches to its two-phase (liquid + gas) state (the rarefaction 
zones).
Below, we will consider rarefaction zones, the state equations for them, 
and mathematical modeling of waves in the two-phase zones.
Wide-range equations of state. We emphasized above that Eqs. (1.14) 
are valid in a very wide range of parameters of a continuous medium, 
including solid, liquid, and gaseous states. However, this generality of the 
equations also determines their relatively small local accuracy. It is impos-
sible to study on their basis the details of phase changes of any matter and 
the transition of one phase of it into another.
Therefore, there are wide-range equations of state that are valid only 
for liquid and gas. The simple version of similar equation is Tait’s equation 
(1.36). Below equations describing the transition of liquid into its two-phase 
state are presented.

where A and B are the constants whose values vary from liquid to 
 liquid. Apparently, two constants in the state equation are insufficient 
for describing the transformation of liquid into its two-phase state. 
Therefore, Eq. (1.46) corresponds only qualitatively to the behavior of 
real liquids. However, beyond doubt, it more correctly describes the 
behavior of real liquids in low-pressure regions than Tait’s equation or 
similar to it [22–25].

Thanks to four constants α , β, γ , and δ , this equation provides a good

thermodynamic state. For example, it was shown in [23] that for water at 
T = 555.22 K, Eq. (1.47) has the following form:

where V  is the volume, and pc and Vc are the pressure and volume in the

that during high speed of dropping the pressure, it can drop significantly 
below the saturation pressure pH. There is the question about the action of 
similar rarefaction zones on elements of constructions.
	
3. Let us consider a thermal equation for water, which is valid over a wide 
range of thermodynamic parameters [25]. The equation consists of three 
expressions, each of which describes a certain interval of variation ρ.

The phenomenological equations (1.36), (1.46)–(1.52) overlap the significant area 
of change of thermodynamic parameters. At the same time, they do not explicitly 
describe some features of the transformation of liquid into gas (steam).
1.4  SIMPLEST EXAMPLE OF FRACTURE OF MEDIA 
WITHIN RAREFACTION ZONES
Above, we have considered the cases when the appearance of a new phase is described 
by wide-range equations of state. Here, an example of a medium (bubble liquid) is 
given, which transforms into a new phase during the process of destruction (transi-
tion into the gas–liquid mixture). This process can be observed in rarefaction zones 
of extreme waves. It can be described in a very rough approximation as a growth of 
gas bubbles and the fusion of them up to the formation of the gas–liquid mixture.
In general, the task of this book is not a detailing description of complex pro-
cesses characterizing the destruction of continuous media. However, during the 
formation of extreme waves, their propagation and reflection from the boundaries, 
regions of rarefying often arise where the continuous medium is fractured. Therefore 
in Chapter 2, a few models of fracture will be described. Then in Chapters 4–6, the 
effects of cavitation and boiling of liquid within extreme waves on the behavior of 
elastic containers will be studied.
In this section, we give the simplest model of fracture as an introduction in the 
subject.
1.4.1  The STaTe equaTion for BuBBly liquid
The case of the transition of a liquid into a gas–liquid state within rarefaction 
waves (cold boiling) can be considered as the simplest example of the destruction 
of a medium. The destruction is described as the growth and fusion of gas bubbles 
 initially existing in the liquid.
The Rayleigh equation. The motion of the bubble wall in the approximation of 
an incompressible fluid is described by the Rayleigh equation [26]:

where pg is the gas pressure, ρg is the gas density, ρ0 is the unperturbed gas density, γ
is the adiabatic exponent for gas (for normal air γ = 1.4), and V0 is the initial volume 
of the bubble. The oscillations can be considered isothermal (γ = 1 in Eqs. (1.55)) if 
the pressure in the liquid changes sufficiently slowly. In this case, there is substantial 
heat exchange between the liquid and the gas.
 
Equations (1.54) and (1.55) are not enough for the closure of the system of equa-
tions of ideal liquid. Let us describe the way of obtaining the missing equation.
The state equation. The motion of a liquid with bubbles of gas or vapor is 
described in the general case by the equations of mechanics of multiphase (hetero-
geneous) media [27]. These equations differ from (1.1)–(1.3) since new terms that 
take into account the transition of mass from one phase to the other are included. As 
a result, the exchange of momentum and energy takes place between them. Usually, 
the exact expressions for these new terms are unknown.
However, liquid with gas bubbles can be described within the framework of an 
ideal fluid if the exchange of mass, momentum, and energy between phases is very 
small in it [28–33]. This approach will be used many times in this book.
Let the gas volume is much smaller than the volume of the mixture. We assume 
that the wavelength of the perturbation is much larger than the distance between 
the bubbles and the radius of them. An interaction of bubbles is absent. They are in 
conditions uniform all-round pressure. The velocity of bubbles relative to each other 
is zero. The temperature of the medium is assumed a constant.
Taking into account the noted above, the initial density of the mixture is repre-
sented as follows:
	
,
0

ρ
=
m
U
m
m  
(1.56)
where ρ0m and U0m are the initial density and the volume of the mixture, respectively. 
The change in the mixture volume is determined by changes in liquid and gas com-
ponents. Since the mass of the same volume does not change, we have

(1.57)
where ρ is the density of the mixture, Um is the volume of the mixture, Ul is the 
volume of the pure liquid, n is the number of bubbles, and V  is the volume of the 
single bubble. Now we find the change of the medium when an extreme wave passes 
through it. We take into account that the medium is a mixture of pure liquid and 
gas bubbles, that is, Um
l

nV . It is emphasized that the compressibility of the 
medium is primarily determined by the compressibility of the bubbles.
First, we take into account the change in the volume of the liquid. Equation (1.36)

We obtain the equation of state that determines the dynamics of the bubble medium 
in an extreme wave for cases where the initial content of the gas in the mixture is 
much less than the initial content of the liquid in it. Eq. (1.62) closes the system of 
equations of mechanics of inviscid nonthermal bubble liquid: (1.1), (1.2), (1.5), (1.54), 
(1.55), sij = 0. If nV = 0, then (1.62) coincides with the linearized Tait equation (1.36).
The presence of gas bubbles significantly changes the properties of the liquid. The 
liquid medium becomes strongly nonlinear, preserving nonlinear properties even 
for low gas concentrations. Let us show this. If the wavelength of the disturbance 
is much larger than the size of the bubbles, then the volumes of the latter change 
relatively slowly. In this case, the equation (1.54) yields p

 in this expression is small since nV0 << 1. However, it deter-

mechanical properties of the mixture.
1.4.2  fracTure (cold Boiling) of WaTer during SeaquakeS
Every day there are earthquakes that cause local oscillations of the ocean surface. If 
the depth is large, these oscillations can evolve near a coast into a tsunami. However, 
situations are possible where the amplitude of seabed oscillations may be compa-
rable with the depth, or where the seabed accelerations considerably exceed g, or 
there is resonance of vertical waves. In these cases, there are strongly nonlinear wave 
phenomena on the surface and at the depth. The bubbles can appear as a result of 
local collapses of water within the rarefaction waves (nonstationary cavitation) that 
take place near the oscillating seabed and the water surface. The explosions accom-
panied by jets of liquid and gas are connected with bursting on the ocean surface of 
large volumes of gas (bubbles).

20
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
During the time of great geographical discoveries, some Spanish and Portuguese 
sailors had defined such behavior as “sea shakes”, and some Dutch captains reported 
“awful seas”. This phenomenon was described in many publications. In particular, 
there is following description [33] “a quite smooth surface of the sea suddenly was 
covered by waves. They promptly grew up to a height approximately 8 meters and 
then promptly fell down, forming deep craters. People began to run captured by 
panic fear along a vessel; and some, having lost their minds, began to jump from 
the vessel. Suddenly the vessel was shaken by a very strong blow, and some persons 
were thrown overboard. The blows from the bottom followed one after another, and 
it seemed that the vessel was banged about a rocky bottom. The bangs then stopped 
instantly”.
Similar extreme waves are the result of seabed vertical oscillations. Almost peri-
odical fracture (cold boiling) of the water near oscillating bottom occurs. Let us 
consider the results of Natanzon’s experiments [28] with a water column in order to 
analyze this periodical fracture of the water.
Oscillograms of the pressure, which is measured near the piston, are presented 
in Figure 1.4 (see, also, Figure 3.5). The sinusoidal curves show the piston posi-
tion. During the experiments, the piston acceleration was slowly increased from 0.2 g 
to 2 g and then was slowly reduced to 0.37 g. One can see that in the frequency 
range extending from 7.7 to 17 Hz, there are large variations in the pressure waves. 
When the down acceleration increases above g, the harmonic oscillations transform 
into peaks, which correspond to collisions of the water and the base. The smooth 
parts of the pressure curves correspond to free flight of the water volume. During 
these moments, above the base, the rarefaction (cavitation) zone is formed. When 
the acceleration reduces, a strong hysteretic effect takes place. For this case, dis-
continuous waves exist in the system up to 0.5 g and then instantly transform into 
harmonic waves of very small amplitude. Thus, according to the experiments (see 
Figures 1.4 and 3.5), the strongly nonlinear discontinuous waves may be generated 
FIGURE 1.4 Hysteretic dynamics of strongly nonlinear oscillations of the vertically excited 
water column (the exciting amplitude is 0.002 m, and the column length is 7 m (see, also, 
Figure 3.5)). The vertical acceleration is slowly increased from 0.2 to 2 g (forced frequency from 
5 to 17 Hz) and then is slowly reduced to 0.37 g (forced frequency from 13.1 Hz to 6.8 Hz) [33].

in the upper-lying material (water) when the down acceleration of the base exceeds 
the gravity acceleration g. The linear continuous waves are excited if the vertical 
acceleration is smaller than 0.5 g.
Thus, if the forced acceleration increases above some threshold level, then the 
linear prediction breaks down. That nonlinearity changes the amplitude and form 
of the forced waves. In particular, the rarefaction (cavitation) wave is periodically 
generated above the vibrating base. However, as shown in Figure 1.4, the amplitude 
of the forced waves is bounded and depends on the hysteretic effect. Because of this 
effect, the maximal amplification takes place when the forced acceleration approxi-
mately equals 0.5 g.
The experiments show that in waves of small amplitude (5 Hz or 6.7 Hz), the water 
remains unchanged, although it contains, of course, bubbles. But when the amplitudes 
of the waves reach extreme values, the water begins to periodically fracture near the 
piston. Thus, in the water column, periodically zones of fracture and bubbly water are 
formed. Of course, the motion of the medium in these zones is described by different 
equations, and certain conditions of fracture are fulfilled on their boundaries.
We will return to the discussion of Natanzon’s experiments more than once, and 
for now, as an introduction to the phenomenon, we consider a simple model of liquid 
destruction.
1.4.3  Model of fracTure (cold Boiling) of BuBBly liquid
It was emphasized that sometimes the multiphase media may be described in terms 
of known classical models. The inhomogeneity manifests itself only in the state 
equation. We obtained the state equation (1.62) for the bubbly liquid. Using (1.62), 
the governing equations are derived for one-dimensional waves traveling within 
fractured zones and zones of bubbly liquid.
Plane waves. Equations (1.1) and (1.2) were written using Eulerian coordinates. 
However, plane (one-dimensional) waves are often studied using the Lagrange 
 coordinates. For this case, we transform from the Euler variable x to the Lagrange 
variable a in Eqs. (1.1) and (1.2). These coordinates are related by the formula 
x =
+

u, where u is the longitudinal displacement of medium. Taking into account 
these formulas, we obtain

(1.74) is different from the sound velocity for the bubbly liquid which was found in 
[29–31] (see, also, (1.78) and Chapter 3).

It can be assumed that the gas bubbles have already merged and the medium was 
transformed from the bubbly liquid to a gas–liquid mixture. Thus, (1.71) and (1.72) 
describe strongly nonlinear behavior of the mixture in the rarefaction zones even for 
arbitrarily low concentration of the bubbles.

If ξ0 = 0, then (1.78) determines the sound velocity of the pure liquid. c2
0l = c2
0 Thus, 
the gas bubbles reduce the sound velocity in the mixture as (1.78) shows. We empha-
size that (1.78) corresponds well to the results of [29–31] and the results presented in 
Chapter 3.
This equation is valid for the bubbly liquid. At the very rough approximation, we 
can assume that it can be used until the moment of fracture of the mixture. Then, it 
is necessary to use Eq. (1.72). It is shown that different equations describe the wave 
propagation in compression and fractured zones of bubbly mixture. Of course, the 
sound velocity is different within these zones (see Eqs. (1.74) and (1.78)).
Thus, we have two equations that describe the different zones of the medium in 
question. How is it possible to determine these zones during the calculation process? 
Indeed, fractured zones arise in the process of propagation of an extreme wave, and 
initially, the medium did not have the fractured zones.
Fracture and restoration of bubbly liquid. At the initial instant, we have the 
bubbly liquid. The pressure can be calculated at each point of the mixture according 
to (1.76) and (1.75). At points where this pressure p− is less than pH (

assume

(1.79)
where pH is some critical value of fracture. The medium is fractured instantly. At 
these points, the calculation is then made according to Eqs. (1.72) and (1.71) for the

fractured medium. However, if in the fracture zones, according to calculations, the 
pressure begins to exceed p ,
H
	
>
+
p

(1.80)
,	
then we assume that the medium instantly restored the nonfractured state. At the 
next moment of calculations, we again use Eq. (1.76) for the bubbly liquid.
Of course, it is possible to realize this algorithm for extreme waves only numeri-
cally. Numerous examples of the implementation of such algorithms will be pre-
sented in this book below. We will study dynamics of structural elements loading by 
extreme waves and impacts, which is accompanied by the destruction of the media 
and restoration of their continuity.
Now let us return to Natanzon’s experiments. It is easy to see that in Figure 1.4, 
the straight lines correspond to zones of liquid destruction, which are represented by 
Eqs. (1.71), (1.72), and (1.79). The peaks correspond to Eqs. (1.76), (1.75), and (1.80).
An algorithm of using (1.71), (1.72), and (1.79) and (1.76), (1.75), and (1.80) may 
be enough complex. Indeed, boundaries separating the zones are not known and 
changed in time. These boundaries may be determined during the calculations. 
We will give many examples of similar calculations in this book.
Remarks. We proposed a few models as the first step of an understanding of the 
very complex problem of dynamic destruction of liquid and solid media. In par-
ticular, we described above the model of certain continuum having initial defects 
(bubbles), and presented equations of motion media and conditions of appearance 
and disappearance of the fractural zones are formulated. We will study dynamics of 
structural elements loading by extreme waves and impacts, which is accompanied 
by the destruction of the media and restoration of their continuity in Chapters 4–6 
and 8.
1.5  MODELS OF MOMENT AND MOMENTLESS SHELLS
Some models of media were briefly described in the previous sections. These models 
will be used in the study of the propagation of waves and their reflection from the 
boundaries. The effects of the reflection often depend on the deformability of the 
boundaries. For example, on rather rigid surfaces, waves of pressure amplify. On 
the contrary, compression waves are reflected from free or very flexible boundaries, 
as rarefaction waves, where the medium can lose its continuity. Free boundaries or 
contact surfaces of different media can be described using the traditional formula-
tions of boundary-value problems in the mechanics of continuum.
However, there is a very important case for applications when a continuous 
medium borders with a thin shell or plate. This case requires special consideration.
1.5.1  ShalloW ShellS and The kirchhoff–love hypoTheSeS
A shell is a body whose thickness h is small in comparison with the other two dimen-
sions. It can be called shallow if the curvature of any part of the shell is not large. 
Let us give the basic relations of geometrically and physically nonlinear theory of 

25
Models of Continuum
shallow shells based on equations of this book [34] and the theory of plastic flow [15]. 
The lines of curvature of the middle surface (equidistant from both surfaces of the 
shell) are used as the coordinates x and y.
The z-axis is directed along the normal to the middle surface to the center of its 
curvature. Generally speaking, shells are three-dimensional bodies. If you want to 
consider of them as two-dimensional bodies, you should use some hypotheses.
The essence of the classical Kirchhoff–Love hypotheses consists in two  statements: 
(1) lines (fibers) initially perpendicular to the middle surface remain perpendicular to 
this surface during deformation and the length of them does not change, and (2) the 
normal stresses on sites parallel to the middle surface are ignorable relative to the 
normal stresses on sites perpendicular to this surface.
Naturally, the higher the accuracy of these hypotheses, the thinner the shell. The 
accuracy also depends on the length of waves propagating along the shell or a wave 
loading on the shell. The hypotheses are not applicable when wavelengths are of the 
order of thickness h.
Let us give the basic equations of motion of the shell element (Figure 1.5):

1.5.2  The TiMoShenko Theory of Thin ShellS and MoMenTleSS ShellS
The greatest error of the above equations is determined by the assumptions that

0. These deformations may be considerable for local dynamic loading, 
in places of contact of a shell with a more rigid body, and all cases when significant 
cutting forces Qx and Qy occur. It is known that under action of the underwater wave,

a plate can be cut off on a rigid boundary [15,35]. Calculations of shell failure cannot 
be made without taking into account deformations ε xz and ε yz and the forces Qx and 
Qy arising near the different stress concentrations.

y, and ; moments Mx, 
My, and H; and forces Qx and y0 in the equations of motion, we obtain the equations 
that determine u, v, w, ψ x, and ψ y.
These equations will not be presented here because of their cumbersomeness. 
For the case of elastic shells, they can be found in the monograph [34].
The equations given above are valid if the maximum displacement of a shell 
is of the same order as a shell thickness or even is more than h. But the displace-
ment should be much smaller than another dimension of the shell. In this case, the 
 boundary conditions on the boundary forming by liquid and shell can be written 
on the undeformed middle surface of the shell [34,35]. Therefore, in the future, the 
linearized boundary conditions are used even for the case of large displacements. 
In particular, we will assume in (1.87) P

Axisymmetric momentless (flexible) shells. Let us consider thin-walled bodies 
of rotation that experience an axisymmetric deformation. The change in the stress 
state along the thickness of the shell does not take into account. Thus, the stress state 
does not depend on bending moments and shear forces.
This theory can be used when performing the following conditions: the shape 
of the shell must be smooth, without sharp changes of curvature; loads should be 
 uniform or should change smoothly; the edges of the shell are free from signifi-
cant cutting and moment forces. It should be noted that the theory is applicable 
if the listed conditions are not completely observed but a local bend is very local. 

31
Models of Continuum
In this case, at a small distance from the zone bending, a stressed state is practically 
momentless [36,37].
It is important that this theory is valid for large displacements (much more of h) 
of the shell points.
The equations of motion of the shell are written with respect to the fixed (Eulerian) 
rectangular coordinates x and y:
	
where s is the length of the arc of the shell along the meridian, measured from its 
pole; Nx and Ny are the forces directed along the lines of meridians and parallels, 
respectively. The angle ϕ between the tangent to the middle surface of the shell and 
the positive direction of the x-axis is determined in the following way:

The forces Nx and Ny are expressed in terms of deformations according to Formulas

directions are determined by the current and initial values of coordinates x0 and y0

Conclusion. The presented dynamical equations of the shallow shells are valid with 
relatively small displacements when usually the moment terms in the equations of 
motion (1.87) manifest themselves. With further growth of displacements, the influ-
ence of moment forces decreases and the assumption about small curving of the shell 
can become invalid. Generally speaking for some cases of large deformations, the 
influence of the moment forces on the final shape of the shell may be small.
This stage of deformation can be studied on the basis of theory of the membrane 
shortly presented above. Sometimes the entire calculation of a shell can be made 
using only the membrane theory.
Final remark. The above are presented in compressed and simplified forms of 
the main approaches to the analysis of the problems considered in this book. Their 
more extended presentation is given in the remaining chapters of this part.

2 The Dynamic Destruction 
of Some Materials 
in Tension Waves
This chapter is devoted to extreme waves of destruction. This subject is very complex 
and may be treated from different points of view. We will use the continuous damage 
mechanics approximation [38–41]. This model was used in many researches. For a 
full enough consideration of this approach, the reader must refer to the special trea-
tises (see, for example, [42–50]). In this book, only some results of different theories 
are presented. Our goal of this chapter is to give the reader a certain understanding 
of the features of the dynamic destruction of some materials and basic approaches 
to the mathematical description of these features. It will allow us to simulate the 
extreme fracture waves in certain materials.
The process of ductile failure in metals involves the nucleation and growth of 
voids. Voids nucleate at the weak points in the material when the tensile stress 
exceeds some critical level. The material around growing voids undergoes a large 
plastic deformation. As a result of these processes, the initial material obtains the 
properties of porous materials. The voids link up to form the fracture surface. One 
aspect of continued interest is the effect of high strain rates (the effects of inertia on 
pore growth).
Extreme waves are simulated often as a plane-fronted compressive wave. It propa-
gates through the material and reflects off a free surface. The compressive wave 
becomes tensile (rarefaction wave) when it is reflected from the surface. If the ten-
sion exceeds the material strength, fracture occurs. This kind of dynamic fracture 
is known as spallation. Our attention in this section will be focused on this type 
of dynamical fracture of ductile materials. This effect may be important in pro-
cesses such as projectile penetration and impact fragmentation of ductile materials. 
Extreme waves and dynamic fracture can also be resulted from the action of the 
enormously powerful lasers on structural elements.
Let us look at the microstructure of a material and its evolution within extreme 
tensile wave (Figure 2.1). In the micrographs, the different stages of the evolution 
can be distinguished. At the initial stage, the deformation is elastic or weakly plas-
tic. Then, when the necking formation starts, pores begin to form. This mechanism 
leads to the formation of macro-cracks, which ultimately result in the fracture of 
the material.

Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
2.1  MODELS OF DYNAMIC FAILURE OF SOLID MATERIALS
Many models have been proposed for dynamic fracture processes. At the same time, 
there are two main approaches to modeling these processes: phenomenological and 
microstructural. In the first approach, there are usually the analytical expressions 
describing an interaction between damage and stresses in material during the load-
ing. Phenomenological models deal mainly with continuum variables such as aver-
age stresses, strains, and void volume. The second approach is based on deduction 
of integral damage characteristics of the material on the basis of the analysis of 
the behavior of an individual microdefect. Microstructural models take into account 
often the inertia of voids growth (pores). Here, we discuss a few models to provide a 
brief sampling in the subject.
High tensile stresses may develop a material within the extreme rarefaction wave; 
as a result, dynamic failure in the form of an internal cavitation may take place. 
This type of failure is termed the spall fracture [42].
2.1.1  phenoMenological approach
In this case, a unified integral characteristic of the process of fracture is introduced. 
In particular, hypotheses are introduced that predicts fracture as soon as some value 
reaches a critical number. This value can be determined by stresses, strains, or 
energy of deformation.
The simplest example of similar hypothesis is the theory of instantaneous frac-
ture [42,50]

The fracture is if (2.1) realizes in some point of material. It is emphasized that we 
use similar fracture condition earlier when the destruction of bubbly liquid was con-
sidered (Section 1.4).

three parts of the diagram: practically undamaged material (nucleation of pores, left), growth 
of pores (center), and the formation of crack and fracture of the material (right).

Sometimes the hypotheses take into account time effects

where ∆t is the time till the fracture under the tension σ . Generally speaking, similar 
hypotheses do not suggest the change in mechanical properties of material during 
deformation. This change take into account continuum damage mechanics [38–41]. 
According to this theory, during the deformation, microdefects begin to grow in 
material. Let the relative volume of them is ξ,
	
,
ξ = V V
p
 
(2.3)
where Vp is the total volume of voids in the microvolume V . The fracture is charac-
terized by porosity α , α = V Vm , in a number of papers. Here, Vm is the volume of 
the material of the matrix (volume of the deformed material without voids (pores)). 
Thus, we have ξ =

damage evolution is as follows:

Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
In Formulas (2.6)–(2.8), the letters A, B, and σ * with numerical lower indices denote 
the constants of materials. As indicated in [55,56], the Tuler–Butcher and logarith-
mic (for iron) formulas describe experimental results most better.
All these theories, however, do not possess universality. They do not take into 
account a number of important effects, in particular, the change of porosity of mate-
rial accompanying the destruction. This lack is absent in models in which the right-
hand side of (2.4) depends on ξ [56].
The results presented above were obtained primarily during 1960s and 1970s when 
instrumentation and computational tools were not as developed and as sophisticated 
as they are today. These tools and the manner in which they are applied to investigate 
spall problems are well described in many publications (see, for example, [42–61]).
It seems important to have a more in-depth details of the process of dynamical 
destruction. For this, obviously, it is necessary to attract additional array of experi-
mental data, associated with the emergence of individual microdefects, their growth, 
interaction, and coalescence. The influence of the size of the defects, inertia of their 
development, and so on must be investigated.
2.1.2 M
 
icroSTrucTural approach
The phenomenological approach considers the destruction as collective effect, in 
which whole ensembles of microdamage are involved. It is difficult to study the role 
of each defect in this process. At the same time, studying the dynamics of a single 
defect is relatively simple. The difficulty, however, is that the integral characteristics 
of the destruction are usually observed. However, it is possible by gradually com-
plicating the model taking into account the interaction of voids, their fusion, and 
unevenness of the initial sizes. Therefore, the necessary stage of the study must be a 
comparison of the parameters of dynamics microdefects and global characteristics 
of destruction in time.
Generally speaking, a dynamic fracture model of the microstructural approach 
includes three systems of equations. First, we should derive equations describing the 
creation of a single microdefect, its evolution, and merging with other defects. The 
conclusion must be made on the basis of clearly formulated hypotheses concerning 
the above phenomena. The second system is based on the statistical methodology. 
Its most important goal is a transition from local fracture characteristics to aver-
aged values. The third system of equations determines the integral parameters of 
destruction.
There are serious difficulties connected with realization of microstructural 
approaches. In this way, empirical data and data of theoretical analysis are usually 
used. As an example, let us examine а model of fracture of а medium obtained by 
analyzing data of the high-speed collision of plates [42] and the pore growth:

It follows from this that exponents in the void radius distribution decrease exponen-
tially with time. However, the experiments [56] do not show such а rapid decrease 
described by the exponents. This discrepancy is due to the fact that Eqs. (2.9) best 
describe the steady state of void growth and does not consider the acceleration, 
which can be important during the initial stage of void growth.
On the whole, all of these make it necessary to use а more complex equation for void 
growth. This equation is obtained by solving the continuum mechanics equations of а 
viscoplastic medium with а spherically expanding cavity [57] (see also the section 2.3):
where b is the radius of the spherical cell embracing the void, b0 is the unperturbed 
values of b, ρ0 is the density of the matrix, and b

It is seen that the last expression is different from (2.11). We think that this expres-

and (2.11).
Numerical study. We present in Figure 2.2 the results of the study of the dynam-
ics of isolated pore in a viscoplastic material. Equation for the pore (2.14) was solved 
by the Runge–Kutta method of fourth order of accuracy.
We study the effects of various terms in Eq. (2.14). The results of the calcula-
tions are presented in the summary diagram (Figure 2.2). Along the abscissa the 
corresponding dimensionless parameter is changed, and along the ordinate axis the 
dimensionless values of the radius at t = 1 μs is presented. Initial (scale) values of

parameters used in the calculations are taken for aluminum and denoted by zero 
indices. In particular, R00 is the radius at t = 1 μs and for p =

9 a. The flow 
stress σ 0 was compared with the flow stress of aluminum, which was denoted as σ 00.
It can be seen that values σ 0 and p have the most significant effect on final radius 
of the pores. Therefore, they should be defined in experiments with the greatest cor-
rection. The rest values weakly affect the process of destruction according to these 
calculations.
Remark. Thus, a great variety of models have been proposed for fracture process. 
What is the reason for the presence of the large number of models?
It is explained by a method of comparing these theories with experimental data. 
Great part of the formulas was obtained after an analysis of results of the high-speed 
collisions of plates (impactor and target). During much time in the experiments, the 
available measurements were only the velocity of the free surface target and the time 
of the separation of the spalled plate from the target. Noted above, phenomenological 
theories of dynamic failure accurately enough described the speed and separation 
time for the rear surface although they were substantially different in detail.
2.2  MODELS OF INTERACTING VOIDS (BUBBLES, PORES)
We studied briefly the nucleation and growth of defects (pores, voids, bubbles). In 
this section, we consider certain models of interaction of these defects. The nucle-
ation in the medium of submicrodefects with а size of 10−7 m is not examined. The 
analysis is extended to the already-formed defects (pores, gas bubbles), their growth, 
and interaction. The stage of interaction just prior to the start of coalescence of 
defects (fragmentation of the medium) is not studied. At the same time in accordance 
with [39–56], it may be assumed that the areas of initiation of cracks which divide 
the medium into fragments are determined by the zones of concentrations of defects 
which formed up to the start of coalescence of the defects (see Figure 2.1).
Since the form of voids in the experiments carried out on viscoplastic materials 
and many liquids is almost spherical, it is assumed that growth and interaction of the 
voids are determined by the pressure, viscoplastic strain, and the time, but not by the 
shear stresses [42,8]. It is also assumed that the rate of displacement of the voids in 
relation to each other is equal to zero.
The study of void dynamics is based on the subdivision of the investigated 
medium into parts, whose dimensions are much larger than the size of the voids. 
FIGURE 2.2 Dependence of the change in the final radius of the pore on the variation in the 
material parameters: (1) z = p, (2) z = σ 0, (3) z = ρ, (4) z = η, (5) z = lnb, and (6) z = R0.

Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
At the same time, the dimensions of the parts are small enough when compared with 
the characteristic scale of a significant change of stresses and pressure within the 
extreme wave propagating in the media.
Interaction of two pores (two gas bubbles). Equation (1.53) describes the radial 
oscillations of a spherical bubble. Comparison of (1.53) and Eq. (2.14) for the radial 
oscillations of a pore in viscoplastic materials shows that these equations are similar. 
These equations differ only in the right-hand side. Thus, there is an obvious anal-
ogy between the equations for bubbles and pores. We will use this analogy when the 
interaction of two pores and two bubbles is considered (Figure 2.3).
Let us consider two spherical bubbles that perform radial oscillations in liquid. In 
this case, the kinetic energy of any point of the medium can be calculated by following 
Lamb’s book [58] and [59]:

equations can be found in [8,61–64].
We assume that Eqs. (2.21) and (2.22) also describe the radial oscillations of 
spherical pores in viscoplastic materials.
Using this analogy, we write down equations of interrelated oscillations of two 
pores as

(2.23)
In (2.23), R1 and R2 are the radii of interacting voids (pores, bubbles), ∆ is a distance 
between centers of the spherical voids. Constants b1 and b2 are the radii of spheri-
cal cells enclosing the pores, with these values being much larger than the distance 
FIGURE 2.3 Two interacting pores (bubbles).

41
Dynamic Destruction of Some Materials
between the pores, but less than the radius of the zone of plasticity around pores. 
Equations (2.23) are written for R1. Corresponding equation for R2 is followed from 
(2.23) if subscript 1 is replaced by 2 and subscript 2 is replaced by 1. Equations 
(2.23) differ from those written for gas bubbles [8,64,65] only by right-hand sides. 
The expressions for the right-hand sides correspond to the equation written for the 
single pore (2.14).
Calculations show [61] that the mutual effect of the cavities which are taken into 
account by cubic terms starts to operate at ∆≤(5 −6)R, where R is the radius of the 
larger cavity. There is no interaction when ∆> (5 −6)R. In this case, the material 
damage dynamics can be described using the equation for an isolated pore. Thus, 
Eqs. (2.23) are useful only if ∆< (5 −6)R. On the other hand, the pores should 
be located far enough from each other. Thus, it seems that the equations are valid 
only for sufficiently small amplitudes of pore oscillations and when the condition

Unidimensional model of interaction of voids. Due to the growth of pores, the 
initially slightly damaged material can turn into a porous material. Let us examine а 
linear chain of defects. We separate in the chain an arbitrary sequence of three cavi-
ties with the radii Ri−1, Ri, and Ri+1, where i = 2, 3… (Figure 2.4).
We also assume that the ith cavity is influenced only by the adjacent cavities Ri−1 and 
Ri+1. The interaction between the defects Ri−1 and Ri+1 is neglected assuming that it is а 
very small quantity. Because of the above assumptions, we can easily derive an equa-
tion that generalizes Eqs. (2.23) and takes into account the interaction of three cavities:
 
where ∆i±1 are the distances between the voids i and i + 1, and between the voids i 
and i − 1, respectively. While deriving Eq. (2.24), it is assumed that the terms in the 
round brackets are of the same order of smallness. They are smaller than the first 
two terms. Consequently, the distances ∆i±1 are considerably greater than the radii 
but this difference is not sufficient to ignore the interaction between the voids (pores 
and bubbles). Equation (2.24) holds for any void in the chain. Therefore, they take 
into account the mutual effect of all the voids through each other.
Equation (2.24) can be used directly for calculating the propagation of damage 
waves in а medium. However, cases are possible in which (2.24) can be conveniently 
replaced by а single equation in partial derivatives. To obtain this equation, taking 
into account the smallness of the distance between the defects, we introduced expan-
sions of the following type:

Case of two spatial coordinates. We will examine а layer of voids distributed in

straight lines parallel to the coordinate axes into а nonuniform rectangular grid with 
the smooth variation of the distance between the nodes, and we will assume that the 
defects are positioned at the nodes of the grid (Figure 2.5). Let it be that each void i, 
j (i, j = 1, 2, 3,…) is influenced by only the adjacent voids in accordance with the law 
of the type of Eq. (2.24). Consequently, for the void with the indices i and j, we can 
write the following equation of the oscillations:

Function Ф in Eq. (2.29) was determined above (see Eqs. (2.27)). Equation (2.29) is 
derived using the assumption of the uniform distribution of the defects, and a dis-
tance between them is denoted by ∆. The range of application of Eq. (2.29) is smaller 
than that of the initial system (2.28). The restrictions on the application of Eq. (2.29) 
can be determined by the same procedure as that used for the chain of voids [61].
Spatial model. Two-dimensional model described above can be generalized 
for the three-dimensional case if we assume that all the voids are positioned in the 
points of intersection of the planes parallel to the coordinate surfaces of the х, у, and 
z of the Cartesian coordinate system.
Let it be that the spacing between the voids changes smoothly and the void Ri j, ,k 
positioned at the points i, j, and k is affected only by the adjacent voids positioned in 
the planes passing through this point. In this case, the system of equations general-
izing Eq. (2.28) is written in the following form:

2.3  PORE ON POROUS MATERIALS
We have considered above the cases when the dynamics of the pore under consid-
eration depends on oscillations of surrounding pores. However, it is assumed above 
that pores do not affect the plastic properties of the material. Let us consider the pore 
dynamics in the initially porous material.
Pore in а compressible porous material. Damaged materials are considered as 
continuum. Oscillations of а spherical pore in this continuum are described by equa-
tions of conservation of mass and momentum:

Subsequent analysis is carried out on the basis of the assumption that the effect

determined by the quantity of the second order of smallness in comparison with the 
main terms. Therefore, the quantities of the third order of smallness are subsequently 
ignored. In this case, Eq. (2.32) yields

Coalescence of pores. We considered qualitatively the results of fusion of pores 
[8] using (2.45). A chain of pores are considered as simple model that allows us to 
study this phenomenon. Interaction of only two pores within the chain is taken into 
account at each moment of time. First (stage 1), the largest pore i of the chain is cho-
sen and its interaction with the largest next pore (i + 1 or i − 1) is taken into account. 
Let the largest from the two is i + 1. As a condition of fusion of them, the following 
condition was applied:

Here, kR is a certain constant, and ∆ is a distance between centers of the pores. The 
radius R of the new pore is found assuming that its volume is V =

i+1. The speed 
of R was found using condition of the conservation momentum. As a result of this 
stage, we find the new largest pore R in the chain. At the next stage, we repeat the 
process using new pore R and its neighbors Ri−1 or Ri+2 (we chose the largest from Ri−1 
and Ri+2). As a result, we have new volume for pore R. This volume depends on all 
the volumes considered for above pairs of pores. Similar calculation for many stages 
allows us to simulate growth and coalescence of pores. It was found that the merger, 
after beginning, continues avalanche-like. As a result, a single pore is formed by 
absorbing all pores existing before.
It was found that at the initial stage of destruction (tens of nanoseconds), the effect 
of inertia on pore growth is important. However, after some time from the starting 
of the interaction of the pores, the speed of their growth reduces. This phenomenon 
takes effect when the average pore size is several times smaller than ∆ in (2.46). At 
the next stage of the dynamic destruction, when radiuses of the pores approach a 
distance ∆, the process of merger obtains aggravated nature, leading to the forma-
tion of macro-crack.
2.4  MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF MATERIALS CONTAINING PORES
We presented theoretical models for calculations of the change in pore sizes and 
their volume content in the material. Of course, the dynamic characteristic of dam-
age should be included in certain state equations (1.10). Let us correct the equations 
of Section (1.1) taking into account the possibility of fracture of media when it is in 
solid state.
It is assumed that pores are equally distributed in all directions of material. In 
this case, damaged materials can be often described within the framework of well-
known classical models. The space-averaged values of strains, stresses, displace-
ments, pressure, and density are introduced to simplify the mathematical model. 
The averaging takes place over the volume element, which can contain much pores, 
but has a small size with respect to the characteristic length of the extreme wave. It 
is assumed that the number of pores per unit volume does not change. The pores do 

47
Dynamic Destruction of Some Materials
not move within the network of the material. In this case, the damaged material can 
be approximately considered as a continuum, and its motion may be described by 
equations of continuum mechanics (1.1)–(1.7) [14,38,39].
Now it is necessary to take into account the change in properties of material in the 
corresponding equations of state because of the porosity change within an extreme 
wave. This is a very difficult task. The situation resembles the appearance of plastic 
deformations. Going from the elastic material model to the plastic one, we changed 
Hooke’s law (1.26) to the form taking into account the accumulation of plastic defor-
mation (1.34)!
In particular, the state equations for solid are usually known for undamaged 
 materials (1.10):

where ρ and eαβ are the values that are determined for the undamaged material. 
However, we have from calculations the density and components of the strain rate 
tensor for the damaged material. Therefore, Relations (2.47) should be rewritten 
using some damaged values since we use Eqs. (1.1)–(1.7), which are written for the 
damaged values. Indeed, we usually use in this book the averaged values and the 
continuum hypothesis [14,38,39].
We assume the smallness of the surface energy of the pores; therefore, the spe-
cific internal energy of the porous material is equal to the energy of the solid compo-
nent substance. In addition, we consider the destruction processes to be independent 
from heat dynamics [65].
To form full system of equations, we must determine the equations that determine 
the growth of damage. The effect of ξ on the material density can be determined as

On the whole, the growth of the pores (voids, bubbles) leads to an increased com-
plexity of mathematical formulations of considering problems. Therefore, a more 
lucid understanding of the impact on the behavior of constructive elements of 
dynamic destruction and plastic deformation materials can be achieved by numeri-
cal experiments using different approaches to describing the process of destruction. 
For example, it is possible to calculate the destruction according to the instantaneous 
destruction model (2.1), by the kinetic equation (2.4) or the equations for spherical 
voids. In the last case, we have

The noted above shows difficulties in studying extreme waves in destruc-
tible media. The study may be realized by numerical methods using step-by-step 
algorithms.
The growth of pores affects only the state equations for sij and p. For the calcula-
tion of sij and p, as in the case of an elastoplastic body, it is necessary to break the 
loading time into several stages. At each stage, there are increments:

However, here, for simplicity, we will neglect the generation of pores and take these 
functions equal. Then, (2.53) yields

Remark. We presented in this chapter the results that were obtained during 
1950–1980 years of the last century. In general, the presented dependencies corre-
spond to the theory of “continuum damage mechanics” [38,39,14]. According to this 
theory, if the effect of plasticity is small, there is a well-established hypothesis of 
strain equivalence. This hypothesis was presented by Lemaitre and Chaboche as: 
“The strain associated with a damaged state under the applied stress is equivalent to 
the strain with its undamaged state under the effective stress” [41].
We have considered several models describing the dynamic destruction of 
 materials. Similar models will be used in this book for studying the propagation of 
extreme waves in various liquid and solid fracturable media.

3 Models of Dynamic 
Failure of Weakly 
Cohesived Media (WCM)
We have considered some models of the destruction of solids in Chapter 2. On the 
other hand, certain mechanism of liquid fracture was considered in Section 1.4. Some 
of the results presented above are applicable to weakly cohesived media (WCM) 
such as mixtures of gas (gas phase), and solid and liquid particles (condensed phase).
In particular, the model of an instant destruction (2.1) is widely used when the 
effect of the destruction of liquid media on the dynamic behavior of engineering 
structures is considered. On the other hand, liquid and WCM have the capacity to 
withstand tensile stresses. This ability can manifest itself under the action of short-
time tensile stresses [68–70]. In the latter case, the strength of such mixtures can be 
estimated approximately according to (2.2).
An enormous literature is devoted to the investigation of dynamic properties of 
these mixtures. We do not have the opportunity to review even the main results 
obtained in this field. Therefore, here we will outline only some results that enable 
the reader to get acquainted with the problem. For us, these approaches are espe-
cially important as they will be used in the relevant parts of this book.
The principal differences between approaches developed below and consid-
ered in Chapter 2 are that here we consider weakly-cohesived media (the initially 
strongly damaged media) and we do not take into account the plastic properties of 
the mixture [71–80].
Before considering mathematical models, we give examples of considering media 
and their behavior in rarefaction waves and during vibrations.
3.1  INTRODUCTION
Granular materials, weakly cohesive deposits, and benthonic dirt can be considered 
as some analogues of bubbly liquids. However, in rest, these deposits resemble solid 
materials since they can resist tension action [33,75,80] (Figure 3.1(a)).
But if you shake this material vigorously, forcing particles move relative to each 
other, and the properties of the material change from “solid” to “gas” states. In par-
ticular, standard experiments with the granulated materials show an appearance of 
bubbles of gas in them under vibrations [33,76,80] (Figure 3.1(b)).
It is possible to talk about “melting” of WCM, and the degree of shaking will 
be related to an “effective temperature” (fluctuations of particle velocity or fluc-
tuations of particle acceleration) of the mixture. In this state, the WCM are not in 
 equilibrium. It needs a constant input of vibrational energy to retain its new state. 

52
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
If the amplitude of the vibrations is reduced, then the mixture (granular liquid) 
should reach a point, at which it “freezes” into a solid [33].
Another example of the described process is illustrated in Figure 3.2. A tube 
 containing gas, solid particles, and a piston is represented, where the gas gets 
strongly compressed by the piston. Three positions of the piston are shown. When 
the piston lifts very quickly, the expanding gas moves the particles into new posi-
tions,  forming new skeletons having a lesser and lesser strength. Similar phenom-
ena can take place within extreme rarefaction waves. In particular, this sort of the 
spalling can take place during a reflection of a seismic wave of compression from a 
free surface of a sediment layer. The WCM can transform into their gas-like state in 
which the material volume increases strongly. As a result, the uplift of a land surface 
can occur.

diameter grains that are intensively shaken, bubbling of air voids can occur (b) [33,76,80].
FIGURE 3.2 Scheme of the uplift of initially compressed granular material during sharp 
decompression [33,80].

53
Dynamic Failure of WCM
Apparently, this uplift of the land surface cannot take place during a long time, and 
the earthquake-induced vertical acceleration should be sufficiently large, greater than g.
3.1.1  exaMpleS of gaSSy MaTerial properTieS
The presence of gas bubbles can have a significant effect on the behavior of many nat-
ural materials. A quarter of the land surface of the northern hemisphere contains the 
permafrost and about 100 billion tonnes of carbon. The properties of the p ermafrost 
strongly depend on the temperature. An increase in the carbon content yields carbon 
dioxide or methane. Methane is bubbling up out and transforms the land surface 
into the gassy soil (see Figure 3.3(a)). Another example of natural gassy material is 
offshore sediments frequently containing bubbles of gas, which is  normally methane 
produced by biothermal process and another process.
The behavior of the weakly cohesive geomaterials depends on their history. 
In particular, the properties of the materials before and after the earthquake may 
be quite different. Due to strong earthquake-induced vibrations, there are multiple 
displacements, cracks, tensional features between oscillating material blocks, and 
tensional features between the surface deposit and the solid base. The material is 
loosened and transforms into liquefied (or gas like) state since the strength and stiff-
ness of the material drop to zero.
The paper [78] explicitly describes these phenomena. A change in the charac-
teristics of the soil of “Treasure Island” during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake 
was described. The initial speed of a shear wave was equal about 160 m/s. After the 
earthquake, it was less than 10 m/s (Figure 3.3(b)). Figure 3.4 shows the change in 
soil properties caused by earthquake. The variation in stress–strain diagram within 
an interval between 6 and 30 seconds after the beginning of the strong oscillations 
is shown in this figure.
One can see progressive reductions in the shear modulus during the earthquake. 
The measured response of soil of Treasure Island may be considered as a reasonable

analogue of the earthquake-induced change in properties of different deposits. The 
similar plots were recorded for soil of a site the Wildlife [78]. There, the soil density 
is higher than that of sand of Treasure Island. This difference in the densities is 
reflected in Table 1 [78]. The peak residual moduli show a reduction 15–35 times of 
the initial modulus, and the low-strain residual modulus shows a reduction 75–500 
times of the initial modulus.
The presented data are typical for many deposits. The particles of the surface 
layer can begin to lose their elastic properties if the vertical acceleration is large 
enough.
3.1.2  Behavior of Weakly coheSive geoMaTerialS WiThin exTreMe WaveS
Our interest is behavior of geomaterials in case of the extreme waves, in particular, 
arising at earthquakes. The behaviors draw the general attention, and at the same 
time, it was quite poorly studied. It is connected with difficulty in their theoretical 
and experimental modeling. As we already emphasized, natural media can change

the mechanical properties during earthquakes. In particular, strong earthquakes can 
significantly change the dynamic properties of water in oceans and magma in vol-
canoes. Since the mathematical description of the change in these properties is an 
aim of this chapter, we will yield some results from observations and experimental 
researches of behavior of WCM during weak and strong vibrations.
At first, let us consider seaquakes to illustrate certain results of this behav-
ior using the results of Natanzon’s experiments (Figures 1.4 and 3.5) [28,33,77]. 
Natanzon studied unexpected cavitation behavior of a water column excited by a 
piston. We assume that the seabed oscillations during underwater earthquakes may 
be modeled as the oscillating piston in Figure 3.5(a), where the upper surface of the 
column was free. Thus, we consider Natanzon’s experiments as the simplest scheme 
of a seaquake. We will use Natanzon’s data to understand qualitatively a large-scale 
phenomenon, which can occur during severe seaquakes.
Figure 3.5(a) sketches the experimental apparatus which Natanzon used. 
Experiments were conducted using a vertical metal tube having an inner diam-
eter of 240 mm and a thickness of 2.5 mm. The piston produced vertical oscilla-
tions of the water. The frequency of harmonic vibrations of the piston could be 
smoothly changed from 0.5 to 50 Hz, and the amplitude l from 0 to 15 mm. The 
pressure on the free surface of the water column was atmospheric pressure, and 
the speed of sound in the tube was 750 m/s. The length of the water column varied 
from 4 to 7.5 m. Therefore, the fundamental frequency of the water column varied 
from 300 to 160 Hz approximately. During the experiments, the piston displacement 
and the pressure near the piston were measured. Experiments showed that large- 
amplitude steep-front waves (shock waves) can be generated in the tube as a result 
of the piston–water collision when the piston acceleration exceeded g.
FIGURE 3.5 Sketch of Natanzon’s experimental apparatus (a). Strongly nonlinear oscilla-
tions of the water column (the exciting amplitude is l = 0.004 m, the column length is 6 m, and 
the forcing frequency is 14 Hz). The flight time is so large that subharmonic oscillations of the 
water column are excited (b) [28,33,77].

56
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
In Figure 3.5(b), the oscillograms of the water pressure are presented, and the 
sinusoidal curves show the piston position. The smooth parts of the oscillograms 
may be explained by the periodical appearances of the gap (bubbly or cavitation 
zone) in the water near the piston. The distance between the peaks determines the 
free flight time of the column. The flight time of the water column is determined by 
the amplitude and the forcing frequency. The pressure peaks are the result of col-
lapse of the gap and the column–piston collision.
According to simple calculations, if l = 0.002 m, then a cavitation zone forms when 
the angular frequency of the piston is 11 Hz. If l = 0.0011 m, then it forms when the angu-
lar frequency of the piston is 15 Hz. In both cases, the piston acceleration slightly exceeds 
g. As a result of periodic collisions of the water column by the piston, shock-like waves 
were excited near the piston rather than sinusoidal acoustic waves (Figure 1.4) [28].
Another interesting example of the formation of bubbles (cavitation zones) in the 
vertical tubes was presented in [79]. The mechanics of forming bubbles was inves-
tigated by using glass beads lying on a vertical vibrating base of the tube. The aim 
of the experiments was to determine whether bubbling is possible in the granular 
beds that are subjected to vertical vibrations. Figure 3.6 (a) shows an image of the 
bed in which the first bubble is created near the base, the second bubble is located 
in the middle of the bed, and the third bubble is approaching the free surface of the 
system. As the vertical acceleration increases, the bubbles become larger as shown 
in Figure 3.6(b). Bubbles close to each other may coalesce and form a larger bubble, 
and as a result, the bed grows in height. A further increase in the acceleration results 
in elongated bubbles, and the bed grows further in height.
FIGURE 3.6 Results of experiments with vertically excited WCM. Bubbles are produced 
in granular materials [79]. Number and dimension of the bubbles depend on frequency ω and 
amplitude A of the vertical excitation.

57
Dynamic Failure of WCM
We think that Figure 3.6 shows the bubbling that takes place in Natanzon’s exper-
iments. On the other hand, Figure 3.6 illustrates the processes near the sea bottom 
and in the bottom mud which accompanied the seaquake. The waves, as shown in 
Figures 3.5 and 3.6, can be formed in different surface layers during great earth-
quakes and seaquakes.
In contrast with Figures 3.5 and 3.6, the waves and bubbles presented in Figure 3.7 
can occur in volcanic conduit magma during earthquakes.
A high-pressure pipe was used in [80]. The pipe models a conduit of a volcano 
and contains gas and solid particles (Figure 3.7). When the pipe is rapidly opened, 
an expansion wave is formed, which moves downward. Within this wave, the mate-
rial expands like magma at the top of the conduit before a strong eruption. Figure 3.7 
shows the formation of big bubbles within the expansion wave. Similar fast growth 
of bubbles in magma qualitatively explains the explosive eruptions of volcanoes.
For this book, it is important that the results presented in Figures 3.6 and 3.7 can 
be interpreted as the destruction or consequences of the destruction of the initial 
media under the action of vibrations or impulse load. However, in contrast to the 
classical destruction (see Chapter 2), the media considered in the experiments restore 
their initial state after the termination of loading.
For us, it is important that in the media under consideration, there is initially a 
certain amount of gas. This quantity determines the nonlinear properties of these 
media. Therefore, the idea arises that their behavior can be described on the basis of 
a unified mathematical model in which the gas component of the mixture plays an 
important role.
3.2  MODELING OF GASSY MEDIA
In this book, we already described the phenomena arising in rarefaction waves, using 
data of experiments and simple mathematical models. These phenomena are now 
well studied. Fundamental books devoted to the transient cavitation, rarefaction 
waves, and boiling of different liquids were published. Probably, similar problems

Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
were most carefully studied by Nigmatulin [27]. However, existence of fundamental 
results and equations does not exclude the development of simplified approaches 
based on analogies, one-dimensional models, and using simplest relations of con-
tinuous media. They allow us to qualitatively understand and even analyze various 
complex processes. In particular, it is possible to consider weakly cohesive deposits 
and benthonic dirt as some analogues of bubbly liquids. Though, in rest, these depos-
its resemble solid materials since they can resist the tension action (Figure 3.1).
A mixture of liquid (typically water) and gas (typically air or methane) occupies 
often pore spaces of many soils (gassy soils). Solid particles of the gassy soil form, 
though, a skeleton, and they can be considered as a continuum (the dense phase). 
Because of the high compressibility, the mechanical properties of gassy soils  resemble 
more the properties of bubbly liquids or gas, than those of a solid body. Therefore, we 
should take into account the high compressibility of the gassy soils. The compress-
ibility usually determines the equation of state. This equation describes an interaction 
between pressure p and density ρ (or p, ρ, and temperature). The high nonlinearity 
determines this equation. In this chapter, we will derive the state equations for grain–
water–gas mixture and the wave equations for corresponding nonlinear waves.
It is well known that the motion of matter containing grains, gas, and water is 
described by the equations of the mechanics of multiphase media [1,2,27]. These 
equations contain terms that describe the transformation of one phase into another 
and the exchange of momentum and energy between them. The exact expressions for 
these terms are, usually, unknown, and, therefore, the behavior of multiphase materi-
als is often described within the framework of well-known classical  models [3,27]. 
Therefore, to simplify an analysis of motion of weakly cohesive deposits, we intro-
duce the space-averaged values: strains, stresses, displacements, pressure, and den-
sity. The averaging takes place over a volume element of the mixture, which contains 
much gas, but has a small size with respect to the characteristic length of the seis-
mic wave. It is assumed that the number of gas inclusions per unit volume does not 
change. The gas does not move within the contact network of grains of the material. 
In this case, the material (mixture) can be approximately considered as a continuum, 
and its motion may be described by equations of continuum mechanics. The con-
tinuum should take into account the most important property of WCMs. Within the 
depression wave, the properties of WCMs resemble the properties of gas. However, 
within the compression zones, the properties of WCM resemble the properties of 
solid materials.

result [29].
Remark. If the volumes of the solid and soft components are zero, then (3.11) and 
(3.12) determine the sound speed in bubbly liquids. In this case, Eq. (3.12) agrees with 
Eq. (2.3) in [30] if we identify φ0 with α. Equations (3.12) transform into Eq. (2.4) 
(from [31]) in the appropriate limit. Finally, Eq. (3.11) can be approximated by

3.2.2  STrongly nonlinear Model of The 
STaTe equaTion for gaSSy Media
We have previously considered the model of highly nonlinear behavior of a bubble 
liquid in extreme waves (Section 1.4.3). Here, we generalize the results given in 
Section 1.4.3 for the case of gassy media.

Equation (3.15) approximately describes in a simple way the real properties of 
WCMs. The tensile strength of the deposit is approximately determined by the ini-
tial (hydrostatic) pressure p0. The material is being fragmented if the pressure drops 
below p0 within the rarefaction wave.
As example of the non-cohesive material, we consider water–gas mixture. 
Figure 3.8 shows the curves corresponding to a few equations of state for the dis-
cussed model of the mixture. Curves 3, 4, and 5 are calculated according to the 
equation of state (3.15) for φ0 = 10−3, 10−4, and 10−5, respectively. It is seen that the 
nonlinearity of the mixture depends on the gas concentration.
Curve 1 corresponds to the classical equation of state for water:

, k = 7.15 and B = 304.5 MPa. However, this 
equation is not fair for rarefaction zones. Curve 2 corresponds to a wide-range 
 equation of state for water (see Section 1.3). It is visible that this curve corrects a 
little unacceptable situation with the accuracy of the classical equation in rarefac-
tion zones.
Only Eq. (3.15) truly describes the behavior of water in rarefaction zones. The 
nonlinearity increases when the gas concentration decreases. The properties of the 
mixture begin to resemble the properties of gas within rarefaction zones. In the last 
case, the main property of the bubbly liquid can be described by two segments (the 
so-called two-line model): one segment is almost perpendicular to density axis, and 
the other segment is almost parallel to this axis.
Thus, we have shown that even highly simplified forms of Eq. (3.9) (see Eqs. (3.14) 
and (3.15)) describe the real properties of water better than the Tait equation and 
some wide-range equations.
However, Eq. (3.9) is too complex in compare with the equation Tait. It is dif-
ficult to use it in compare with using the equation Tait. Therefore, it makes sense to 
rewrite (397) in the form of the Tait equation.

Therefore, we assume that many results and models of the theory of 
bubbly liquids are valid for modeling the weakly cohesive gassy materials.
Equation (3.17) opens the possibility of greatly simplifying the equations 
of gassy media by introducing the velocity potential.

We have developed a simplified theory of wave processes in WCM based on the 
model of a continuous medium. It is emphasized again that the most important prop-
erties of the medium under consideration are determined by the compressibility of 
the gas. Below, we will pay special attention to the effects of the dynamic properties 
of the gas on the governing equations. This effect is modeled on the basis of effect 
of the gas bubble oscillations. We will show that there is a connection between the 
theory and the classical wave equations. 
3.3  EFFECTS OF BUBBLE OSCILLATIONS ON THE ONE-
DIMENSIONAL GOVERNING EQUATIONS
Here, we consider WCM under sharp decompression as a mixture of the condensed 
phase and the gas bubbles [88–90].
The equation of state for WCM, containing oscillating gas bubbles, is derived. 
Then, for this mixture, the governing nonlinear wave equation is written. It is shown 
that in the low-frequency limit, and for weakly nonlinear waves, the theory yields 
the Boussinesq equation. In the case of the high-frequency limit, the Klein–Gordon 
equation with quadratic nonlinearity is obtained.
3.3.1  differenTial forM of The STaTe equaTion
We modify Eq. (3.7) taking into account oscillations of gas bubbles. A change in 
the bubble radius R can be defined by the Rayleigh–Plesset equation [91] with the 
surface tension:

Now, using (3.29) and (3.30), we can rewrite the equation of state (3.7) as	
Let us consider the state equation (3.31) attentively. The equation takes into account 
an inertia of the bubble oscillations. Because of the inertia, a reduction in the density 
can continue, although an increase in the pressure begins. In other words, a bubble 
attains its equilibrium volume not instantly after loading, but because of the inertia 
and the nonlinearity of the bubble oscillations only after a certain period of relax-
ation. Therefore, the mechanical properties of the mixture, for example, the viscos-
ity, can change with time.
Linear bubble oscillations. The main nonlinearity of the mixture is determined 
by its high compressibility. Therefore, we can ignore the nonlinearity of the bubble 
oscillations. For simplicity, we also assume that µg = 0 and σ = 0. The bubble radius 
is the sum of R0 and the disturbance R*:

One can see from the last expression that the elementary volume of the mixture 
can expand, owing to the inertia of bubbles, although an increase in the pressure 
begins. On the other hand, a considerable negative pressure can appear in the mix-
ture, owing to the bubble inertia, if the incident decompression wave was very short. 
For example, the high-negative pressures can appear in liquid, which are not break-
ing its continuity if the negative pressures exist for very short time, and the initial 
volume of bubbles is extremely small. Certainly, an appearance of such situations in 
daily practice is almost impossible. Therefore, such possibility is completely ignored 
by the models of the “hull” cavitation considered in Chapter 4.

where R is determined by (3.42). Thus, Eq. (3.43) is strongly nonlinear equation for 
considered model of the mixture.
Remark. At first glance, the effect of gas on the form of Eq. (3.43) may be very 
small. If the amplitude of the oscillations of the bubbles is small, then this influence 
is completely ignorable. But this is not the case since the average density of the mix-
ture ρ0 depends on the gas density in the bubbles (see Eq. (3.5)).

We derived the wave equation (3.46) with three wave speeds: “low-frequency” speed 
c0 is defined by Expression (3.49), “high-frequency” speed c2 is defined by Expression 
(3.51), and the speed c1 (3.50) depends essentially on viscous properties of mixture 
and the compressibility of the condensed phase. We emphasize that the speeds c1 and 
c2 weakly depend on gas concentration in comparison with c0.
Below, a few special cases of Eq. (3.46) are considered.

Apparently, the formulas for c2
1 and c2
2 given are not all ways applicable. Indeed, 
the whole analysis is based on the assumption that the wavelength is much larger 
than the size of the bubbles. Therefore, the theory does not cover frequencies close 
to the resonance frequency of bubbles. The value c2
2 can serve only as a guide for 
experiments. On the other hand, we are not sure of the applicability of the models 
used in the case of very viscous liquids. This case can serve also only as a guide for 
experiments.
3.4.3  one-Speed Wave equaTionS
Of course, we do not expect that all the above expressions for wave velocities 
describe reality. But perhaps they determine some critical values or tendencies that 
arise when one or another parameter changes.
It is very important to compare the above-presented results with experiments. It is 
possible when waves have one speed.

This equation coincides with that derived in [30].
Equation (3.65) was used for the simulation of experimental data. Namely, it was 
assumed that Φ = exp (i ka
t
−ω ). The last expression was substituted into (3.65), 
and the corresponding dispersion equation was obtained. The similar dispersion 
equation was also obtained earlier in [31]. The dispersion equation was used to 
describe the results of experiments. The results of the comparison are shown in 
Figure 3.13.

Dynamic Failure of WCM
The solid curve in Figure 3.13 represents the theory for the actual experimental 
distribution, whereas the broken line represents the theoretical result if all the bub-
bles were of the same radius R0 =

10−4 m. The difference between these curves 
clearly demonstrates the influence of a small spread on bubble sizes. With regard to 
wave speed, the agreement with theory is reasonable. Note in particular that above 
resonance, the speed of propagation of a wave reaches the values larger than the 
sound speed in pure water.
3.4.4  influence of viScouS properTieS on The 
Sound Speed of MagMa-like Media
The magma is a mixture of liquid, bubbles, and solid particles [92]. Of course, many 
features of volcanic activities are ascribed to the presence of bubbles in magma. 
According to many publications, bubbles can significantly reduce the sound velocity 
of magma. The motion of huge bubbles in the volcanic conduit can generate seismic 
waves and acoustic waves in the air. However, these results were obtained for low-
viscosity liquid, and their applicability has not been tested. Therefore in [93], experi-
ments were conducted with high-viscosity silicone oil and a commercial syrup. It 
was investigated the responses of a bubble and liquid–bubble mixture to weak shock 
waves. It was obtained the following important result for this section: bubbles do not 
decrease the velocity of pressure waves when both rigidity and viscosity of the liquid 
FIGURE 3.13 Sound speed in gas bubble–water mixture as a function of frequency. The 
solid curve represents the theoretical results for the actual bubble distribution. The broken 
curve results if all the bubbles have the same size R0 =
×

10−4 m. The dots represent the 
measured values [30,31].

74
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
are large. Because magma has a large rigidity, bubbles do not decrease the sound 
velocity of viscous magma.
Thus, a wave speed of some media with a large viscosity [84,93] depends on the 
viscosity, and the bubbles do not decrease the wave speed of media with a large 
 viscosity, which is determined according to Eq. (3.43).
Let the viscosity µ1 is very large. Considering this case, we will write (3.43) t aking 
into account the most important viscous terms.

(3.67)
In this case for large µ1 the sound speed of the mixture can be mainly determined 
by viscosity (see Eq. (3.50)). It is known that many magma-type melts have a high 
value of surface tension, which depends strongly on temperature and varies widely. 
For example, for tin at 400°C, the surface tension is large and about 520 × 10−3 N/m. 
Approximately the same value of surface tension has mercury. Of course, these  values 
strongly depend on temperature. Therefore, for some values of magma temperature, 
its surface tension can be equal to (3.67).
Let the pressure of the medium and the size of the bubbles are such that the 
critical condition (3.67) is satisfied. Then, the sound velocity in the mixture can be 
greatly increased, is determined by the viscosity of the medium, and does not depend 
on the volume of the bubbles. However, if the viscosity or pressure in the medium 
is changed, so that the critical condition ceases to be fulfilled, the influence of the 
bubbles begins to appear and the velocity of the sound can be greatly reduced.
In general, this result agrees with experiment [93]. Experiments with silicone oil 
and syrup containing bubbles showed that:
 
1. When the viscosity is small, the pressure wave has smooth front followed 
by an oscillation, which is a typical feature of a shock wave in a bubbly 
liquid with low viscosity. When the viscosity is large, the wave front is as 
sharp as the incident shock wave.
 
2. As viscosity becomes smaller, the propagation velocity approaches the 
shock wave velocity, which was about 188 m/s. It approaches approximately 
3580 m/s as the viscosity becomes large.
In [94–96], it is emphasized that the experiments give an insight about the dynamics 
of viscoelastic bubbly liquids, which is important for the developing mathematical 
and experimental methods to investigate seismoacoustic phenomena in volcanoes. 
Indeed, when the magma moves upward, the pressure temperature in it decreases. 
All these lead to a change in the surface tension of the bubbles. As a result, the 

75
Dynamic Failure of WCM
situation arises when the critical condition (3.67) is satisfied and the speed of sound 
in the magma can also be determined by the viscosity.
Remark. We have considered small oscillations of WCM. We found that even 
with this restriction, the basic relation (3. 43) determines an interesting specter of 
equations that describe weakly or completely unexplored features of wave propaga-
tion in these media.
Of course, it is one thing to predict a certain phenomenon using mathematical 
model, and another case, usually more complicated, is to observe this phenomenon 
in Nature or discover it in an experiment! In particular, we do not know the work 
in which the propagation of three-speed waves in bubble media is described, and 
the influence of viscosity on the propagation of waves in bubble media is poorly 
studied. We associate this with the complexity of observations and the experimen-
tal study of these physical effects. Finally, it is possible that such effects are not 
essential for very strong extreme waves, which are of primary interest for this book. 
Examples of highly nonlinear behavior of the media under consideration are shown 
in Figures 3.1–3.7, 3.9, and 3.10.
Of course, such a complex behavior of media can be studied only on the basis of 
nonlinear wave equations.
3.5 E XAMPLES OF OBSERVABLE EXTREME WAVES OF WCM
Let us consider some nonlinear waves observed in Nature. We remind that WCM are 
considered [97,98]. If you shake the media vigorously, the properties of them change 
from “solid” to “gassy material” states.
3.5.1  MounT ST helenS erupTion
It is possible to talk about “melting” of WCM during vibrations. In particular, certain 
eruptions of volcanos may be connected with this phenomenon. Let us consider the 
catastrophic eruption of Mount St. Helens.
Geologists call Mount St. Helens a composite volcano (or stratovolcano), which 
is a term for a cone-like volcano having steep, often symmetrical sides. Composite 
volcanoes are constructed by alternating layers of lava flows, ash, and other volcanic 
deposits. Those volcanoes tend to erupt explosively, and Mount St. Helens exploded 
on May 18, 1980, in the worst volcanic disaster in the recorded history of the United 
States. That was after 2 months of earthquakes and intermittent, relatively weak 
eruptions.
Intense earthquake activity persisted at the volcano during and between visible 
eruptive activities. Seismographs began recording occasional spasms of volcanic 
tremors, a type of continuous, rhythmic ground shaking different from the discrete 
sharp jolts characteristic of earthquakes. The triggering earthquake was of slightly 
greater magnitude than any of the shocks recorded earlier at the volcano. For exam-
ple, shocks of magnitude 3.2 or greater occurred at a slightly increasing rate during 
April and May with five earthquakes of magnitude 4 or above per day in early April, 
and 8 per day in the week before May 18th. Initially, there was no direct sign of any 
eruption, but small earthquake-induced avalanches of snow and ice were reported by 

76
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
aerial observers. Thus, the volcano material became more and more weaker because 
of the earthquake-induced vibrations (Figure 3.14).
About 8 O’clock in the morning, there was an earthquake of magnitude 5.1, with 
epicenter at a depth of 2 km under the volcano. As a result, the volcano material fully 
transformed into gassy state. Edges of the crater of the volcano started to collapse 
because of a landslip. The gases and magma began to erupt into the atmosphere. 
What happened next was described by the geologists Keith and Dorothy Stoffel, who 
were then in a small plane over the volcano’s summit.
Among the events they witnessed, they “noticed landsliding of rock and ice debris 
inward into the crater…the south-facing wall of the north side of the main crater was 
especially active. Within a matter of seconds, perhaps 15 seconds, the whole north 
FIGURE 3.14 Dynamics of the volcano Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980. Photos by Gary 
Rosenquist.

77
Dynamic Failure of WCM
side of the summit crater began to move instantaneously…. The nature of move-
ment was eerie… The entire mass began to ripple and churn up, without moving 
laterally. Then the entire north side of the summit began sliding to the north along a 
 deep-seated slide plane. I (Keith Stoffel) was amazed and excited with the realiza-
tion, that we were watching this landslide of unbelievable proportions…. We took 
pictures of this slide sequence occurring, but before we could snap off more than 
a few pictures, a huge explosion blasted out of the detachment plane. We neither 
felt nor heard a thing, even though we were just east of the summit at this time”. 
Realizing their dangerous situation, the pilot put the plane into a steep dive to gain 
speed, and thus, he was able to outrun the rapid eruption cloud that threatened to 
engulf them. The collapse of the north flank produced the largest landslide-debris 
avalanche ever recorded in historic time.
A volcano system (vent, conduit, and magma chamber) can be quite stable and 
single shock cannot transform all volcano materials into weakly cohesived state. 
However, the focusing of the shock energy in the top can transform the material there 
in the weakly cohesived state. As a result, some conditions are formed for a short-
time eruption [33,77] since the shock can open the conduit vent. In the last case, the 
pressure drops down and the volcano magma can begin to boil.
To discuss these phenomena, we will consider the dome (or plug) as a cover clos-
ing the conduit. When the magma pressure in the conduit exceeds some critical level, 
the cover lifts and a short eruption occurs. Then, gas pressure in the conduit reduces, 
and the cover drops down. As a result, converging radial waves and diverging radial 
waves of the surface deformation are being formed.
Similar processes were observed in the volcano Santiaguito, Guatemala (see 
Figure 3.15), where the local peak of the vertical acceleration of the crater surface 
was up to 3 g [33,77].
3.5.2  The volcano SanTiaguiTo erupTionS
A ring-like eruption of the volcano Santiaguito is shown in Figure 3.15((a), top). The 
eruption is a result of the dome uplift. Then, the converging wave propagating in 
atmosphere is formed, and it focuses on the dome center. Figure 3.15((a), bottom) 
shows the top of the volcano Santiaguito between the eruptions. Thus, on the vibrat-
ing surface of the volcano top, there may be a complex interaction of atmosphere, 
cracks, and boiling magma. As a result of the interaction, a short-time eruption can 
take place. The interval between eruptions was 20–40 minutes. Considering this and 
the remarks presented in the previous subsections, it can be assumed that the average 
speed of waves in magma of Santiago is of the order of 10 m/s, and the height of the 
magma conduit is about 10 km.
Thus, when the gas pressure near the volcano vent increases above some critical 
level, the cover is lifted up and a smoke column erupts. During a few seconds, the 
20–80 m thick dome (whose radius is about 200 m) is being lifted by the gas pressure 
up to several tens of centimeters. These large and rapid uplifts occur 1–2 times per 
hour, together with explosive ash-rich eruptions. Then, the pressure reduces near the 
vent and the cover drops down. Thus, the phenomena were excited as a result of the 
periodical degassing of the conduit magma. Waves in the crater were measured: their 

78
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
speed was about 30–50 m/s, which is too small for typical elastic waves within solid 
or fluid magma. The short-duration events and the dome–crater collision generate 
the periodical earthquakes or trembling of the ground.
The phenomenon is additionally illustrated in Figure 3.15(b) where different areas 
of erupting magma are discussed. Area D is the region where almost microscopic 
bubbles exist. It is the high-pressure field. There the wave properties of the medium 
are apparently described by the linear equations of Section 3.3. Area B is the field 
of explosive growth of bubbles where pressure is rapidly falling. As a result, the 
linear approximation is inapplicable and the equations of Section 3.4 must be used. 
Within the fragmentation layer, the fusion of bubbles begins. Magma is converted 
into a mixture of condensed particles and vapor. This is a very complex process. 
Perhaps, this process might be described using continuum approximation and wide-
range state equations (1.10) or using some approaches of Chapter 2. As a result of 
fragmentation, the mixture arises. Its wave behavior can be qualitatively described 
by equations of the hydrodynamic type presented in Section 3.2.4 if the effects of 
vortices may be ignored.
Strongly nonlinear vertical waves may be generated in the volcano conduit 
because of periodical opening of the vent. The simplest scheme of this process is 
FIGURE 3.15 Focusing of the short-time periodical eruption of the volcano Santiaguito, 
Guatemala. (After http://www.photovolcanica.com/VolcanoInfo/Santiaguito/Santiaguito.
html) (a). A sketch of bubbly magma fragmentation (b). See, also, Figures 3.5–3.7, 3.14, 3.15.

79
Dynamic Failure of WCM
presented in Figure 3.16, where p is the pressure and P is the critical value of the 
pressure.
The cover (vent filling or dome) of the conduit lifts up when a pressure p reaches 
the critical value P, and then, magma begins to boil and erupt. As a result, a wave of 
expansion (depression) is generated at the vent, the pressure drops down, and then, 
the cover closes the conduit. The process repeats when p under the cover increases 
above P.
On the whole, the process resembles boiling in a kettle. Its cover rises when the 
pressure of the steam increases above some critical value, and then, the steam pres-
sure decreases. As a result, the water in the kettle starts to boil more strongly, and 
steam and foam erupt from the kettle. When the pressure drops below some critical 
value, the cover closes the kettle and then, the process repeats.
Thus, the volcano oscillations strongly depend on the behavior of magma in rar-
efaction extreme waves. Therefore, this behavior has been studied in many researches. 
In particular, a high-pressure pipe is shown in Figure 3.7. The pipe models a conduit 
of a volcano and contains gas and solid particles. When the pipe is rapidly opened, an 
expansion wave is formed, which moves downward. Within this wave, the material 
expands like magma at the top of the conduit before a strong eruption.

A solution of this equation can be written as the quasi-harmonic wave having slowly

Dynamic Failure of WCM
Remarks. We presented in this chapter a number of linear and nonlinear equations 
allowing us to investigate the wave processes in suspensions. Some of these equa-
tions are well known, and there are solutions for many cases of them. Derivation of 
these equations was one of our important goals. On the one hand, their conclusion 
demonstrated the commonality of the theoretical approaches developed. Starting 
from same mathematical model, we derived a few well-known equations describing 
the problem. Thus, the relationship of the basic nonlinear wave equations is shown. 
An idea is that they can have similar solutions. Therefore, the possibility is opened of 
using known solutions for analyzing the processes of propagation of extreme waves 
in media that are not very well studied.
Simultaneously with the description of wave fields, some of these equations and 
solutions determine the change in gas content and porosity of media. The change 
can characterize dynamic destruction by the growth of pores or bubbles. We remind 
that the growth of pores and bubbles is described by both wave equation and the 
corresponding ordinary equations. If the volume of spherical voids reaches a certain 
critical value, then we can speak of local destruction of the medium in this volume.
We introduced wave fields based on the wide-range equations of state in Chapter 1. 
However, although this approach is so general that it opens the possibility of taking 
into account even phase transitions, it should be detailed in the area where the mate-
rial may be fractured. Therefore, in Chapter 2, we dwelled in more detail on models 
that make it possible to study the influence of the destruction of a medium on the 
propagation of waves.
On the other hand, this is determined by the fact that the process of destruction 
is extremely important for many engineering applications. Therefore, we dedicated 
Chapters 2 and 3 to it. We give an idea of the dynamic destruction. The fracture of 
a medium element is complementary to the general picture determined by the wide-
range equations of state.
It is emphasized that the detailed investigation of the processes of dynamic 
destruction is beyond this scope of this book. However, we will touch on some of the 
most important aspects of this problem taking into account the destruction of media 
in extreme waves. The theories of similar destruction are very complex, so we have 
considered the most simple models.
In particular, in Chapter 2 and this chapter, simplified models of media contain-
ing spherical defects develop. Namely, equations of the form (2.28) or (3.43) are 
derived. In particular, equations of Sections 2.2 and 2.4 allow us to directly cal-
culate the porosity dynamics of materials in extreme waves. In contrast, equations 
following from (3.43) define a function characterizing the growth of pores. Only 
after determining these functions and using them in the equations of pore dynamics 
(bubbles) can we calculate the dynamics of material destruction in various parts of a 
wave traveling in the medium.
For example, different wave conditions can arise when explosive volcanic erup-
tions occur. There, in a relatively short time, a rapid change in force and temperature 
fields occurs in a sufficiently large volume of the medium, leading to a colossal 
growth of initially microscopic bubbles. Apparently different conditions can appear 
in different parts of the magma at the same time, which can be described by the 
models of continuous medium presented in Chapters 1–3. In particular from models

Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
using wide-range equations of state, it is possible to come to the models reducible to 
the long-wave equations, the Klein–Gordon and Schrödinger equations.

Part II
Extreme Waves and 
Structural Elements
Science is built up with facts, as a house is with stones.
But a collection of facts is no more a science than a heap of stone is a house.
Henri Poincaré
We discussed in Part I the issues related to the destruction of solid and liquid media. 
Typically, this destruction is associated with the occurrence in the condensed media 
of extreme tension stresses (rarefaction zones). Such destructions often occur as a 
result of reflection of extreme waves from free surfaces or passing of waves in a less 
dense medium.
In this part, we will consider actions shock waves and explosions on structural 
elements. Under the action of an underwater wave on the structure on its sur-
face and near it the destruction of the liquid can take place. The cavitation waves 
can occur (see Section 2.2). In this part, we focus on details of the destruction 
of liquid media in rarefaction waves. Such waves usually arise during the reflec-
tion of u nderwater compression waves from free surfaces, or solid, but deformable 
( flexible) boundaries.
We emphasize that the term “destruction” is used for liquids only in the case of 
extremely short waves. In the case of sufficiently long waves, the term “cavitation” 
(cavitation destruction) or “cool boiling” is commonly used. Here, we study effects 
of cavitation on transient interaction of underwater compression waves with solid but 
deformable (flexible) boundaries. Effects of destruction of deformable boundaries 
are taken into account in Chapter 6.

4 Extreme Effects and 
Waves in Impact-Loaded 
Hydrodeformable 
Systems
The phenomenon of cavitation occurs when a liquid evaporates and gas (vapor) 
bubbles are generated in zones where the pressure falls below its saturated vapor 
pressure (or boiling point) [1,2]. Steady cavitation is usually observed in areas of 
high-speed fluids. For example, this phenomenon takes place behind bodies moving 
with high velocity in water. Unsteady (transient) cavitation may be generated under 
certain conditions in the flow near propellers, pumps, and within different hydraulic 
machines. This phenomenon is usually accompanied by the violent expansion and 
the collapse of gas bubbles. Transient cavitation may also be generated during the 
reflection of an underwater shock wave from a free water surface [2,3], or from a 
plate and shells. It must be emphasized that a considerable negative (i.e., tensile) 
pressure can appear as a result of the reflection of very short and very strong shock 
waves. A negative pressure can exist before the rupture of liquid by means of genera-
tion and expansion of vapor bubbles.
4.1  INTRODUCTION
In this section, we will consider the strongly nonlinear effects connected with the 
cavitation in a liquid generated because of the interaction of long underwater wave 
with plates. In the case cavitation appears if the pressure drops to values of the order 
of (−0.2)–(−0.35) MPa. This phenomenon is important for explosive hydro-forming 
technology using thin metal plates and in cases when explosions are used for peace-
ful or military purposes in liquid media.
Explosive hydro-forming of the metal work pieces. This technology uses the 
energy generated by an explosive detonation in water. It has been used in a wide vari-
ety of applications in the automotive, aerospace, and maritime industries for almost 
70 years. This technique is especially efficiently for large parts. Since the pressure 
generation comes from an explosive charge, we do not need larger machinery to form 
large parts, and we simply apply a larger charge. Current explosively hydro-formed 
parts range up to 6 ft.
The sheet metal work piece blank is lowered into a tank filled with water. The 
explosive charge is placed at some predetermined distance from the work piece 
(Figure 4.1).

92
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
On detonation of the explosive, a pressure pulse of very high intensity is produced. 
A gas bubble is also produced, which expands spherically and then collapses [4,5]. 
When the pressure pulse impinges against the work piece, the metal is deformed 
into the die with a high velocity. This velocity can be so high that the metal breaks 
away from the water. Cavitation arising in this case can greatly spoil the process of 
forming the work piece.
Ships and offshore structures. A study of the dynamic response of ships and 
offshore structures to the action of explosions and shock waves is required for safety 
and serviceability assessments, including habitability on ships. For merchant ships, 
accidental explosions have to be considered as possible events, as they could be 
severe enough to cause serious damage to structures and injuries to people. They are 
also becoming of great interest due to increasing public concern about ship safety 
and potential harm to the environment [6–8].
Basically, design methods adopted for naval and merchant ships are the same, but 
naval ships must fulfill some specific requirements [9–15]. In particular, they are 
required to retain a high standard of operational effectiveness when under attack.
Figure 4.2 shows the results of an underwater explosion of a torpedo. It was found 
that the results of the attacks are connected with the transient cavitation (the negative 
pressure) on the ship girder. Above-water weapon attacks include air blast loads. The 
negative pressure and the impulse caused by the expanding bubble are main reasons 
of the final anomalous sag distortion of the ship girder [10].
Underwater weapons usually also explode near to the hull (Figure 4.3a). As a 
result, an underwater shock wave can be formed in water. High-velocity interaction 
of it with the constructions is connected with many complex phenomena. In particu-
lar, the so-called “hull” cavitation can strongly change the shock pressure [16–19]. 
FIGURE 4.1 Scheme of explosive forming of the sheet metal.

93
Extreme Effects and Waves
Hull cavitation (near the hull) or the so-called bulk cavitation (far from the hull) can 
occur at points where the local pressure (the sum of shock wave pressure and the 
ambient static pressure at that depth) drops below the saturation vapor pressure. This 
element of the interaction is qualitatively shown in Figure 4.3b. The solid line (circle) 
corresponds to the undisturbed hull. The dashed line corresponds to the hull loaded 
by the underwater shock wave. The bubbles determine the cavitation zone [17,18].
The hull cavitation, owing to its specifics, is almost unknown in hydrodynamics, 
though some books and a number of articles are devoted to it [3,8–28]. In particular, 
a gas–water mixture may be generated due to the hull cavitation. The gas–water 
vapor appears because the water volume has locally emptied from the compression 
due to the hull element displacement [17–19]. The cavitation limits the reduction in 
the water pressure. As a result, cavitation can increase the pressure on the deform-
ing surface and may determine the result of the ship hull–extreme underwater wave 
interaction.
4.2 U NDERWATER EXPLOSIONS AND EXTREME 
WAVES OF THE CAVITATION: EXPERIMENTS
Now we consider the influence of deformability of the water surface on the explo-
sion pressure [19,20,23]. First, as a limiting case, we consider the free water surface.

Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
The photographs presented in Figure 4.4 illustrate three instants following an 
underwater explosion near the water surface. The explosion product (a dark spherical 
spot) and the expanding spherical shock wave are shown in Figure 4.4a. The initial 
stage of the reflection of this wave from the free water surface is shown in Figure 4.4b. 
The dark zone located under the free surface and above the explosion product is the 
transient cavitation zone. This zone expands as shown in Figure 4.4c.
Let us consider the hull cavitation on the thin flexible solid surfaces. In Figure 4.5, 
these surfaces are modeled by a round plate. The plate was loaded by an underwater 
shock wave.
The circular closed pipe whose left-hand end is at the center of Figure 4.5 is sur-
rounded by fluid and is orientated horizontally, extending to the right beyond the 
image. The experiments have been performed using a thin (0.02 in.) plate of cellulose 
acetate 6 in. in diameter backed by air, and photographing the water in front of the 
plate after reflection of a shock wave. The cavitation zone is shown by a multitude 
of bubbles. This zone arose following the impact of an underwater shock wave onto 
a flexible plate.
Thus, with sufficiently large amplitude, the pressure will become negative at 
points in the fluid. This corresponds to a rarefaction wave reflected from the acceler-
ated surface of the plate. If the water cavitates, the subsequent motion of the plate 
will be modified [11,23].
The photos presented in Figures 4.6 and 4.7 illustrate the interaction of a tube wall 
with a shock wave generated by the electro-explosion of a metal wire in water filling 
the tube (cylindrical shell). The wire is spread along the tube axis. The pictures were

obtained by photographing from the end face of the cylindrical steel tube (radius 
1.47 cm, shell thickness 2 mm, length 10 cm) immersed in water.
Figure 4.6 shows typical photographed scans of the tube section [19,21–24]. The 
upper photo shows a typical photographed scan of the deflection of an internal point 
of the cylindrical shell. The shell deforms, and its radius increases. As a result, the 
cavitation zones are formed (the lower photo and Figure 4.7). The inner surface of the 
tubes is seen as the dark lines clearly visible at the first instants after the explosion. 
The central dark zones are formed by the metal–water vapor (explosion  product). 
The bright zones are water. The straight lines are the shock wave trajectories. The 
dark zones, located within the water and near the wall of the shell, are formed by the 
transient cavitation.
Figures 4.5–4.7 demonstrate some important peculiarities of the hull–wave inter-
action. The wave impacts the structure. It accelerates and the rarefaction (cavitation) 
zones are formed in the water [19,21–24].
The destructive effect of giant waves is well known, and hence, the prediction of 
where and when they will occur is of extreme importance to all who lives or works

beside or upon the sea. The existence of these extreme waves makes it important 
to re-examine some fundamental ideas of merchant ship design, which were devel-
oped earlier [6–8]. In particular, experience from designing underwater naval ships 
 (submarines), which are required to retain a high standard of operational effective-
ness under explosion attack, may be used.
4.3  EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF FORMATION AND 
PROPAGATION OF THE CAVITATION WAVES
The process of interaction of extreme water waves with a ship hull is very complex, 
since it may be associated with large strains in the structural elements and the gen-
eration of cavitation in the water. This complex interaction process has not been 
studied fully, although now powerful numerical codes are available [9,10,13–16], 
which allow the response of a ship hull to the action of water waves to be calculated. 
However, there are large uncertainties in the determination of loads from extreme 
waves acting on the structures. Therefore, the results of the calculations need to be 
supported by experimental data. This is especially true for local elements of a hull 
such as panels and plates.
In this section, we consider some important aspects of the transient interaction of 
deformable surfaces with water waves. This problem is examined using an experi-
mental approach, by creating a high pressure wave in water and impacting it on 
plates with various properties and thicknesses. The experiments are focused on these 
extreme and potentially damaging waves whose loadings cannot be predicted very 
accurately in simulations.
Many tests were conducted using an apparatus whose principal features are pre-
sented in Figure 4.8. The fundamental principle used in the apparatus is the conversion

of the kinetic energy of a rapidly moving mass (a flat piston) into water pressure energy. 
The piston was accelerated by a compressed gas in the upper part of the cylinder.
The experimental apparatus consists of a vertical cylindrical metal tube (1) hav-
ing an inner diameter of 112 mm. The tube wall thickness is 20 mm. The acoustical 
sound speed calculated for water in the tube was 1265 m/s. The plane piston (2) 
impacts the water surface and causes the compression wave (3). The tube bottom is 
closed by the circular plate that is clamped around its edge. This plate can be replaced 
during the experiments in order to examine an influence of its properties (thickness 
h and stiffness) on the resulting pressures. The compression wave deforms the plate 
as shown in sketch. The plate is shown in its undeformed state (4) (Figure 4.8a) and 
deformed state (Figure 4.8b). An air layer ahead of the piston was compressed during 
its acceleration. This diminished the wave amplitude in the water to about half com-
pared to what it would have been in the absence of an air layer. The pressures were 
measured at different points in the water using piezoelectric pressure sensors and 
recorded on an oscilloscope screen. The piezoelectric pressure sensors and displays 
had previously been calibrated statically and dynamically, and both calibrations gave 
identical results.
4.3.1  elaSTic plaTe–underWaTer Wave inTeracTion
A series of experiments was made when the mass of the piston was 13 kg, and the 
height of the water column was 500 mm. The impact velocity of the piston onto 
the water was kept constant at 1.8–2.0 m/s. The wave amplitude was approximately 
1.25 MPa in the experiments with a wavelength of 2.5–3 m.
An oscillogram of the pressure measured on the surface of a steel plate with 
thickness h = 20 mm is shown in Figure 4.9. One can see that the pressure increases 
rapidly and then decays according to an exponential law. We will consider this pres-
sure as the incident wave, which is the same for all tests with elastic plates.
Results for aluminum alloy plates with thicknesses h = 8, 4, and 2 mm are shown in 
Figures 4.10a–c, respectively [3,17,22–24]. The pressure oscillograms measured on the 
tube wall at points 255 mm and 55 mm from the plate surface correspond to curves 1 and 
2, respectively. The left-hand graphs have a 2 ms timescale, and the right-hand graphs 
have a 0.5 ms timescale. It can be seen that a reduction in the plate thickness results in a 
radical change in the pressure curves with an increase in the interaction time.
FIGURE 4.9 An oscillogram of pressure in the incident wave [23].

98
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
We will consider primarily the curves obtained by sensor II close to the plate. 
These curves consist of the first peak, a pressure drop section, and a second peak 
which is somewhat longer. The first peak results from the pressure occurring at the 
very beginning of the interaction when the plate just starts to move. The interaction 
is evident here in that the peak amplitude depends on the plate thickness and is less 
than the maximum pressure of the incident wave.
The pressure remains positive for the 8 mm thick plate (a). Cavitation occurs in 
the water for the 4 and 2 mm thick plates (curves 4.10b and c). The pressure then 
increases, which is explained by the collision between the water column and the 
plate when the cavitation zone near the plate collapses. The amplitude of the second 
peak is close (h = 8 mm (a)) to, or exceeds (h = 4 mm (b) and h = 2 mm (c)), the mag-
nitude of the first peak and is less dependent on h. The length of the pressure decay 
section and the second peak is related to the deceleration of the plate by elastic forces 
and the velocity of its reverse motion, which are determined by the fundamental 
natural frequency of the plate.
Oscillograms I show the pressures measured further from the plate than oscillo-
grams II. There the effects of the plate thickness are weaker. The first peak is deter-
mined by the frontal part of the incident wave. Therefore, this peak weakly depends 
on the plate thickness. The second peak is determined by the water–plate interaction. 
For h = 4 mm (b) and h = 2 mm (c), the cavitation is determined by the form and the 
amplitude of the second peak. The third peak is formed from the reverse motion of 
the plate and connects with the period of the natural oscillation of the plate.
Figure 4.10 shows that the cavitation measured near the plates strongly depends 
on mechanical and geometrical properties of the plates. In particular, if the plate is 
thick enough, cavitation effects are either absent or small. However, if the ratio of the 
radius R of the plate to its thickness h is large, the effect of cavitation on the resulting 
pressure may be very important. It is evident that the initial wave is damped by a thin 
plate. Therefore for thin plates, the first peak of the pressure may be much smaller 
than the amplitude of the initial wave (1.25 MPa). The subsequent two-dimensional 
waves generated by cavitation then move along the plate surface. These waves form 
the peaks measured in the plate center. Hence, the lifetime of the cavitation cavities 
strongly depends on the plate properties.
At the same time, cavitation may be generated far from the plate due to the result-
ing superposition of the incident (Figure 4.9) and the reflected wave. This so-called 
bulk cavitation is determined by curves 1 in Figure 4.10. During the initial period 
of the interaction, the water motion may be considered as one-dimensional. Then, 
because of the plate deflection, which strongly depends on the radial coordinate, 
the water motion near the plate transforms into two-dimensional motion, and radial 
waves of pressure and cavitation are formed. Therefore, oscillograms measured at 
different points of the plate could be expected to be different.
4.3.2  elaSToplaSTic plaTe–underWaTer Wave inTeracTion
The hull cavitation strongly depends on the amplitude of the incident wave and its 
duration. Therefore, we have studied this phenomenon examining the interaction of 
a circular plate with extreme waves which can rupture it.

99
Extreme Effects and Waves
The same apparatus was used. The height of the water column was increased to 
650 mm, the impact velocity of the piston was increased from 1.8–2 m/s to 30–33 m/s, 
and the piston mass was reduced from 13 to 2.3 kg. As a result, the peak pressure in 
the incident wave increased to 15–18 MPa.
The pressure oscillograms recorded on the tube surface at points distant by 
255 mm (curve 1) and 55 mm (curve 2) from a metal plate with thickness h = 20 mm 
are shown in Figure 4.11. One division in curves 1 and 2 corresponds to 8 and 11 MPa, 
respectively. Curve 1 has two large peaks, explained by the passage of the incident 
and reflected waves; curve 2’s first peak is large and is caused by an approximate 
doubling of the wave amplitude at the plate. There is also the second peak, which is 
not far from the first one. It is impossible to explain its appearance in terms of the 
wave reflected from the piston. The origin of the second peak is apparently related to 
the radial motion of the water at the plate surface, caused by a certain deformability 
of the plate and the tube wall, due to the very high pressure generated near the plate. 
There is a third insignificant peak on both the upper and lower curves.
Further experiments were carried out using plates where the loadings resulted in 
elastoplastic strains.
FIGURE 4.10 Effect of plate thickness on the water pressure [23]. The pressure oscillo-
grams for plates with thicknesses h = 8, 4 and 2 mm are labeled as 1, 2 and 3, respectively. 
The pressure oscillograms measured on the tube wall at points 255 mm and 55 mm from the 
plate edge correspond to curves 1 and 2, respectively.

100
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
Oscillograms of the pressure measured at the edges (curve 1) and at the center 
(curve 2) of plates are presented in Figure 4.12. The curves of Figure 4.12a cor-
respond to h = 4 mm, and the curves of Figure 4.12b correspond to h = 2 mm. The 
pressure was measured at 15 mm from the plate surfaces. The rapid changes in the 
pressure curves are associated with the origination of hull cavitation in the water 
and the radial water motion caused by the plate deformation. Since the incident wave 
is very large in magnitude and short in duration, the plate accelerates very quickly 
at the beginning of the interaction. As a result, the pressure drops to zero and the 
plate separates from the water. The subsequent deceleration of the plate by the strain 
resistance forces, and the action of the earth’s gravitation, results in the disappear-
ance of cavitation, and the plate makes contact with the water by impact causing a 
new pressure peak. There is then the possibility of a second acceleration of the plate 
causing a separation of it from the water, and repetition of the process. Of course, 
this sequence is complicated by the radial motion of the pressure and the cavita-
tion waves along the plate surface. The experiments showed that the peak pressure 
amplitudes depend on the thickness h of the plate, and the amplitude increases as h 
increases.

4.4  EXTREME UNDERWATER WAVE AND PLATE INTERACTION
In this section, the influence of deformability of the plate and cavitation in the liquid 
on the process of the transient plate–liquid interaction is investigated. Cavitation is 
modeled as the instantaneous destruction of a liquid in a rarefaction wave. Wave 
processes in the experimental apparatus (Figure 4.8) are studied.
4.4.1  effecTS of deforMaBiliTy
It is assumed that the edge of the plate is rigidly clamped and that the front of the 
extreme wave is parallel to the plate surface (Figure 4.8). At the initial moment of 
the interaction, the pressure is constant on the plate surface. At the next instants, 
because of the plate deformation, the axisymmetric loading of the plate occurs. The 
influences of membrane forces and plastic deformations are ignored. In this case, the 
equation of plate motion has the following classical form (see Section 1.5):

Starting values for the calculation for instants t = 0 and t = τ are determined by the 
initial conditions.
The results of numerical study of the influence of the plate thickness on the inter-
action are shown in Figure 4.13 [17,18,23]. A steel circular plate (R = 5.5 cm) was 
considered. The following parameters describe the initial wave form: A = 2.5 MPa, 
α = −0.07 cm−1, β = −5 cm−1, and c0 = 1500 m/s (4.5).
In Figure 4.13, the curves labeled 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 correspond to the plate 
thicknesses of 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 cm. The crosses show the pressure p correspond-
ing to an absolutely rigid surface.
As can be seen, the influence of the plate pliability manifests essentially immedi-
ately. The first pressure peak and the following form of the pressure curves strongly 
depend on the plate thickness. In particular, for h ≥0.08 cm, the pressure does not 
drop below zero, while for h ≤0.4 cm, a disruption (cavitation) of the fluid is pos-
sible if it is assumed that cavitation occurs at pressures in the range from −0.2 to 
−0.35 MPa. As the plate velocity approaches zero, the plate becomes effectively 
more and more rigid to the water wave, and the pressure starts to increase. The water 
is compressed to higher positive pressures during the reverse motion of the plate 
and the pressure starts to exceed the pressure that would occur for a rigid surface 
(crosses). The absolute value and the shape of the second series of pressure peaks 
in Figure 4.13 are dependent on the natural frequency of vibrations of the plate. 
FIGURE 4.13 Pressure (left) and displacement (right) curves at the center of plates of thick-
nesses h = 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 cm as a function of time t from 0 to 17 ms for the pressure, and 
from 0 to 33 ms for the displacement (no-cavitation model) [23].

103
Extreme Effects and Waves
An increase in the frequency (plate thickness) results in a diminution in the spacing 
between the pressure peaks. Thus, the effect of cavitation is expected to be impor-
tant if the duration of the loading by the water pressure is less than the fundamental 
period of the plate vibration.

However, the plate is not rigid, but starts to deform and move under the influence of 
the pressure pulse. This changes the pressure pulse (see Eq. (4.2)). If the full pressure 
drops below some critical value pk in certain point i, then we assume that this point of 
the wet plate surface separates from the water and cavitation is generated in this point 
according to the cavitation model. In this point, the delta function is changed to 0 in 
Eq. (4.8). If the following calculations show that in this point, the full pressure is above 
the critical value pk, then in this point, the delta function is returned to 1 in Eq. (4.8).
Namely, at each time step m + 2, the values wm+2 are determined using earlier 
founded wm+1, wm, and δ m+1 for each point of the plate (4.6). Then, the pressure of the 
fluid is determined (for the step m + 2) according to the model of ideal liquid (4.2). It 
is assumed that cavitation exists at the points in which the pressure is lower than pk.

The effects of cavitation on the pressure and displacement of plates were studied 
in [17–23]. Some results are presented in Figures 4.14–4.16 for the pressure and 
displacement curves calculated for a D16AT duralumin plate (E = 7.15 × 105 kg/cm2, 
v = 0.3, ρ = 2.8 kg/cm3, R = 5.5 cm). The following parameters describe the initial 
wave form: A = 16.9 kg/cm2, a = −0.07 cm−1, β = −0.3 cm−1, and c0 = 1200 m/s. It 
was assumed that p = −2 kg/cm2

Pressure curves at the plate center are presented in Figure 4.14 (solid lines with 
cavitation, dashed lines with no cavitation). Curves of the pressure marked with the 
numbers 1, 2, 3 (no cavitation) and 4, 5, 6 (cavitation) are shown for plates with thick-
nesses h = 0.8, 0.4, and 0.2 cm, respectively. Curves 5 and 6, which are calculated 
according to the cavitation model, have sections that are coincident with the line 
p = 0. For h = 0.8 cm (lines 1 and 4), the pressure at the center reaches negative values 
but does not drop below the critical value; that is, cavitation does not occur. Cavitation 
appears for h = 0.4 cm (lines 2 and 5). The lifetime of the cavitation zone is 8.3 ms. 
For h = 0.2 cm (lines 3 and 6), the cavitation zone exists for approximately 13.3 ms.
The curves in Figure 4.15 characterize the changes in the pressure and displace-
ment at the surface of the h = 0.2 cm plate. The dashed curves 1, 2, 3 (no cavitation) 
and solid curves 4, 5, 6 (with cavitation) correspond to the times 8.3, 16.6, 58.3 ms 
and 8.3, 16.6, 27 ms, respectively. The cavitation model showed that the displace-
ment reached its maximum value earlier (curve 6) at t = 27 ms, compared to the 
non-cavitation model which gave the maximum value later (curve 3) at t = 58.3 ms. 
The maximum displacement found with cavitation (curve 6) was almost twice the 
displacement calculated according to the non-cavitation model (curve 3). It is evi-
dent from Figure 4.15 that the central part of the plate moves as a rigid body at the 
initial instant that the shock pressure is applied, when the displacement and pressure 
change rapidly only near the edge. Therefore, a low-pressure zone is generated near 
the edge (curves 1 and 4). At t ≈8.3 ms, the cavitation forms a ring-like low-pressure 
zone (curve 4). At t ≈16.6 ms, the cavitation zone covers the central part of the 
plate. The velocity of the plate motion later decreases as it reaches its maximum 
displacement (curve 6) and the cavitation zone diminishes. There is no cavitation at 
the beginning of the plate’s return motion when t ≈27 ms.

BrKMts (h = 0.1 cm, E = 1.05 × 106 kg/cm2, v = 0.3, ρ = 8.5 g/cm3, R = 5.5 cm) on the 
amplitude A is shown by dots in Figure 4.16. As the wave amplitude diminishes, a

slow drop (according to a linear law) is observed in the displacement amplitude down 
to A ≈14 kg/cm2, when a jump-like drop in the maximum plate deflection occurs 
(the calculation is made up to the time t ≈70 cm c0 ).
Thus, the jump-like and significant diminution in the deflection amplitude for a 
moderate change in the amplitude A was found. This effect is associated with the 
phenomenon of cavitation in the water. For A ≥14 kg/cm2, cavitation occurs at points 
of the water abutting the plate, which causes a growth in the total pressure acting on 
the plate (as compared with the computation without cavitation): for A < 14 kg/cm2, 
there is no cavitation on the plate surface, and the nature of the interaction is com-
pletely different.
Curves of the pressure change are constructed in Figure 4.17 for the case A = 14.1 
kg/cm2 (curve 1) and A = 13.7 kg/cm2 (curve 2) with the possibility of the appear-
ance of cavitation taken into account. For A = 14.1 kg/cm2, the curve shape agrees 
with that found for A = 16.9 kg/cm2, while for A = 13.7 kg/cm2, the pressure curve 
is similar to that computed for A = 16.9 kg/cm2 but without taking account of the 
cavitation. We connected this jump effect with generation and focusing of ring-like 
cavitation wave in the plate center (see, also, Figure 4.15 (left)). The calculation is 
made at the time t ≈70 cm c0.

Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
On the whole, the calculations show that the effect of cavitation on the impact 
deformation of deformable elements may be very important. In particular, the cavita-
tion tends to increase the wave pressure on the elements.
4.4.3  effecTS of caviTaTion in The liquid voluMe 
on The plaTe–liquid inTeracTion
Formula (4.7) was obtained taking account of the possibility of the origination of 
cavitation on the body surface (which corresponds to the case of separation of the 
surface from the water), but it does not take account of the influence on the interac-
tion of cavitation within the water volume. This, in principle, is the constraint on 
Formula (4.7) since cavitation in the water volume can alter the pressure acting on 
the body substantially. The contribution of cavitation within the liquid volume will 
evidently be more significant if prolonged separation of the body surface from the 
fluid will not occur.
Qualitative analysis of the cavitation interaction process. A compression 
wave is reflected from a body upon which a wave is incident, and the body is set 
into motion. As the velocity of the body surface increases, the reflected compression 
wave goes over into a tension wave, which upon being added to the tail part of the 
incident wave can cause the appearance of tensile wave and discontinuity in the liq-
uid (see Figure 4.18). Later, the tail part of the initial pressure wave incident on the 
surface of the discontinuity is reflected as a new tension wave. Thus, new and new 
discontinuities can form. On the other hand, tensile (rarefaction) waves are reflected 
from the free surface of discontinuity as compression waves. Complex interference 
between the incident and reflected tension and compression waves occurs, which is 
accompanied by the formation and joining together of discontinuities.
A qualitative picture of the one-dimensional cavitation interaction of the incident 
wave with a certain point of the plate is shown in the z, t plane in Figure 4.18. The 
solid straight lines characterize the waves moving toward the plate surface, while 
the dashes determine the reflected waves. The curve starting from the point 0 deter-
mines the plate deflection. The lines parallel to the t axis are the location and lifetime 
of the discontinuities in the fluid.
FIGURE 4.17 Extreme amplification of the pressure because of focusing the cavitation 
wave in the plate center.

107
Extreme Effects and Waves
The plate is fixed for t = 0, and it later starts to be displaced becoming more and 
more “soft” for the incident wave. At a certain time t1, the wave starts to be reflected 
as a tension wave. The intensity of the tension wave increases as the velocity of plate 
motion increases. As a result, the separation of the plate from the fluid can occur, or 
a discontinuity appears in the liquid.
It is seen that the cavitation interaction of deformable bodies with liquid may be 
very complex. Instead of the initial compression wave, the complex series of com-
pression and rarefaction waves act on the body surface. As a result, the body surface 
begins to oscillate. This conclusion agrees with many observations (see, for example, 
Figures 4.19–4.22).
In order to better describe the results of the experiments, let us consider the inter-
action of a circular plate being the bottom of a cylindrical tank with an acoustic 
underwater wave (see an apparatus for hydrodynamic stamping of components from 
thin-sheet metals and alloys (Figure 4.8)). The liquid motion is considered potential, 
and the wall of the tank is not deformable. The pressure in the incident wave is given 
in the previous form (4.5), and the influence of the static pressure is neglected.
The problem consists in the joint solution of the equation of motion of the plate 
(4.1) and the wave equation for the liquid (water) in the tank:

Generally speaking, (4.14) is valid only for small displacement of the contact surface. 
However, our researches [17–19] showed that the linear form of the condition is valid 
enough for the displacement much more than the plate (shell) thickness.

Method of solution. The solution was sought by the finite difference method. 
The region occupied by the plate and the liquid was divided into a rectangular grid. 
The central differences or the one-sided differences (on the boundaries) were used.
The effect of cavitation was taken into account in accordance with the recom-
mendations of [17–19]. At each time step m + 2, first the formulated aforementioned 
boundary problem was solved using w, u, and ψ  found at the nodes of the grid on 
steps m + 1 and m. Then, the pressure of the fluid was determined (for the step 
m + 2). The regions in which the pressure was lower than the tensile strength pk 
were assumed to be cavitation zones. Thus, while determining the cavitation zones, 
the liquid was viewed as ideally elastic. It is emphasized that the values ψ  were used 
that had been found at the preceding steps by taking the possibility of cavitation into 
account. If there was cavitation according to the calculation for the step m + 2, then 
inside the cavitation zones, the values ψ  were redefined by Eq. (4.11). Analogously, 
the calculation of the liquid was made at each time step of solving the problem.
Some results of the calculation and comparison with the experimental data. 
Now we estimate the accuracy of the approaches developed above to cavitation 
effects. An attempt is hence made to take account of the influence of the air layer 
originating ahead of the piston on the pressure in the water. The increase in the air 
pressure in the fluid results in an exponential increase in pw to the time t1 when the 
piston impacts on the fluid surface. It is assumed that the pressure prior to t +

= 10 cm c , and pk = −2 kg/cm . In this case, the shape and length 
of the wave corresponded sufficiently well (Figure 4.9) to those observed. The length 
of the numerical cell along the cylindrical axis was 0.6 cm, the length of the numerical 
cell along radius was R/10, and the time step was 0.15 cm c0, where c0 = 1200 m/s.
The plate thickness and material during the experiment were selected so as to 
assure sufficient displacement and the appearance of cavitation effects in the zone of 
elastic operation of the chosen material.
Duralumin plate. Displacement (curve 1) and pressure (curve 2) oscillograms 
near the center of a duralumin plate with h = 0.2 cm are presented in Figure 4.19. The 
pressure was measured by a sensor at the end of a thin rod fastened to the cylinder 
wall at 12 mm from the plate. The maximum values of the displacement and pressure 
were approximately 0.52 mm and 7 kg/cm2.
The displacement curve has a significant lag relative to the pressure curve (on the 
order of 0.35–0.40 ms). Despite the action of a considerable pulse (the first peak on the 
pressure curve), the plate remains absolutely fixed. The plate starts to move opposite 
rather in the direction of action of the pressure. Such a nature of the interaction is 
impossible. The strain gauge therefore does not record the initial stage in plate motion.

112
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
Indeed, according to the calculations (see Figure 4.15), the center of the plate 
moves at the first instants as the undeformable body. Then, the wave of the bend-
ing comes to the center. As a result, the plate begins to move back for very short 
time. Only after this, the plate begins to move again in the loading direction and the 
strain gauge begins to fix this motion. On the whole, the plate motion is oscillatory. 
Acceleration and deceleration sections can be distinguished on the deflection curve. 
The peak pressure change in the liquid is explained by cavitation effects.
Results of the displacement and pressure computations at the central point of the 
plate are presented in Figure 4.20. Let we stop on curves of 4.20a. Curves found 
taking into account the cavitation in water volume are superposed by solid lines. 
However, the curve A is found according to the 2D theory of the ideal elastic model 
of the liquid (water).
Curves found taking into account the cavitation only on the plate surface are 
superposed by dots. The dashed curves were calculated according to the model 
of Section 4.4.1 without taking into account the cavitation. Qualitative agreement 
between the solid curves and the experimental results is observed. The lines super-
posed by the dots and dashes correspond worse to the experimental data. If cavita-
tion is not taken into account, then the rarefaction in the water reaches −7 kg/cm2, 
which contradicts the experiment.
The quantitative discrepancy between the maximum values of the solid and 
experimental curves reaches 300% for the displacement and 200% for the pressure. 
This is primarily explained by the inaccuracy in the experiment. In the initial stage 
of the interaction when the central part of the plate moves as a rigid body, the wire 
strain gauges are unsuitable, in principle, for the determination of the deflection at 
the center. The pressure sensor (of approximately 11 mm diameter) and the elastic 
rod on which it is disposed affect the measured pressure, and this distortion is not 
taken into account in the theory. Theoretical and experimental curves determined 
the pressure at different, albeit nearby, points of the water. On the other hand, the 
used numerical cells do not assure high accuracy of the calculations. It is assumed 
in the computations that the height of the water column exceeds 180 cm, while the 
height in the experiments was 50 cm. Therefore, the influence of the water upper 
boundary was not taken into account. Finally, the theory of cavitational interaction 
used here does not itself take account of the whole complexity of the process occur-
ring here in the water.
An analysis of the theoretical and experimental curves permits the conclu-
sion that the strain gauge starts to measure the strain at t = 55 – 60 cm c0 when 
w ≈−0.122 cm (Figure 4.20a). Namely, then does the displacement diminish tempo-
rarily and a trough, seen well on the displacement curves, appears. The occurrence 
of trough is not directly dependent on the arrival of a bending wave from the edge 
to the center, which is reached at t ≈36 cm c0 for the incident wave taken. It appar-
ently appears because of deceleration of the center part, when a gas cavity originates 
above it, and a −2 kg/cm2 negative pressure is reached with a subsequent acceleration 
during collision between the plate and the water, when the cavitation cavity vanishes 
and the pressure wave is fixed at the center.
Let us consider the displacement curve starting with the line w ≈−0.122 cm and 
the pressure curve computed using the cavitation model. These curves are in good 

113
Extreme Effects and Waves
agreement with the experimental curves. In particular, the agreement is observed 
between the maximum displacement of 0.0504 cm, measured from w ≈−0.122 cm, 
and that found experimentally.
Two curves of the pressure calculated for water without cavitation are presented 
in Figure 4.20б. We used different numerical schemes for these calculations. In con-
trast with Figure 4.20a, it is seen that the results do not agree with experiments 
(Figure 4.19).
The BrKMts alloy plate. Oscillograms for plates from the BrKMts alloy 
(h = 0.1 cm) are presented in Figure 4.21. The curves differ from those obtained for 
the duralumin plate. The lifetime of the cavitational cavities grew; the plate decelera-
tion and subsequent acceleration sections due to pressure occurring during collapse 
of the cavitational cavities became more noticeable. The deflection curve lags by 
approximately 0.80–0.85 ms as compared to the pressure curve. The displacement 
curve starts with a trough. The measured maximum displacement and pressure val-
ues are approximately 0.7 mm and 5.5 kg/cm2.
Displacement (a) and pressure (б, в) curves, computed for a plate from the alloy 
BrKMts (h = 0.1 cm), are constructed in Figure 4.22. The notation in curves (a) and 
(б) corresponds to that in Figure 4.20. They were computed for pk  
2
= −kg/cm2. 
As pk increases, the deflection calculated with cavitation taken into account in 
the volume of the water does not change, but the maximum values of the pressure 
diminished. This is seen from the pressure curves (Figure 4.22в) constructed for 
p  = −1.3 kg/cm2
k
 (solid curve) and pk  
0
=  (dashed curve).
Comparison the curves in Figure 4.22, computed with cavitation in the water 
taken into account, and the oscillograms in Figure 4.21 show that the pressure curves 
are in good qualitative agreement. This also refers to the location of the peaks and 
cavitation troughs on the pressure curves (the first, moderate peak on the theoreti-
cal curves is not determined in the experiment). The maximum values of the pres-
sure computed for pk = 0 and pk  = −1.3 kg/cm differ by 20% and 35%, respectively, 
from those measured. As pk diminishes, the divergence of the maximum values of 
the pressure increases. The theoretical displacement exceeds the measured value 
almost fourfold. Such a significant difference between the displacements when 
agreement between the pressure curves is good is explained by experimental error, 
as in the case of the duralumin plate with h = 0.2 cm. The deflection starts to be 
measured from the time t ≈130 – 140 cm c0. The deflection of the center point of 
the plate hence equals 0.3 cm. Taking this into account, the discrepancy between the 
maximum deflections found theoretically and experimentally diminishes to 100%. 
Starting from t ≈130 cm c0, the section of the displacement curve (see Figure 4.22) 
is in good qualitative agreement with the experiment. There is a trough, and the 
repeated deceleration of the plate is clearly defined.
The difference observed between the theoretical and experimental curves can be 
explained by the same reason as for the case of the duralumin plate. However, here 
the error in the assumption that the deflections are small, used in deriving (4.1), can 
be perceptible since the deflection exceeds the plate thickness by more than threefold.
The displacement and pressure curves computed with cavitation on the plate sur-
face taken into account (superposed by dots in Figure 4.22) are in worse agreement 
with experimental data than those constructed with cavitation taken into account in 

114
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
the volume of the water. Still more significant is the discrepancy between experiment 
and the results of a computation without taking account of the influence of cavitation 
(Figures 4.22a and б, dashed lines).
Conclusion. There is extreme importance of the cavitation effect for problems 
considered here.
4.4.4  effecTS of plaSTiciTy
Now, on the basis of a previously formulated models (Sections 1.2 and 1.5), we can 
investigate the process of hydrodynamic pressing of plates in a press gun (see Figure 4.8  
as the scheme). We will form the large plastic deflection of plates to more correctly 
compare the results of calculations and experiments.
Below the equations of motion of the plate are presented for the case of large 
displacements. The plastic properties of the material are described by the theory of 
flow. The motion of the liquid is examined on the basis of the wave equation. The 
possibility of cavitation is taken into account.

where z is the coordinate normal to the middle surface of the plate.
The above equations, supplemented by the relations of the theory of plastic flow 
and the experimental data, allow us to calculate the plastic deformation of a circular 
plate by an impact of liquid (see, also, Sections 1.2 and 1.5).
We consider the potential motion of the liquid. Let the compressive wave pro-
duced by the piston impact is acoustic. When the wave is reflected by the plate, cavi-
tation may occur. Outside the cavitation zone, Eq. (4.9) is correct. The appearance 
and disappearance of cavitation are determined by Expressions (4.10) and (4.12). 
Inside of cavitation zones is used (4.11).
Let us formulate the boundary conditions of the problem. Here, we should take 
into account the possibility of large displacements of the plate. In this case, the 
kinetic condition on the plate has the form [17,18]:

where s is the unit of length measurement. Following [18,19], it is possible to rewrite 
Eq. (4.9) in the new system of coordinates.
The problem consists in the simultaneous solution of the equations of motion 
of the plate (4.20)–(4.26) and Eq. (4.9) written in coordinates β2 and β3 using the 
above-mentioned boundary and initial conditions. It is emphasized that according to 
[18,19], the geometric nonlinear terms in Eqs. (18. 20), (18.27), and (18.28) have to be 
taken into account only for very large displacements.
Method of solution. The solution was sought by the finite difference method. 
The region occupied by the plate and the liquid was divided into a rectangular grid. 
The central differences or the one-sided differences (on the boundaries) were used. 
Numerical calculation algorithms are briefly described in Section 4.4.2.
In determining the plastic strain component, schematized tensile stress–strain 
diagrams with linear strain hardening were used (see Figure 1.3). At each step N, we 
carried out the iteration refinement of the cumulative plastic deformations by an algo-
rithm described in [18,19,25] (see, also, Section 1.2). The step for correction of the 
plastic deformations was one order larger than the step of the difference grid in time.
Results of the calculations. Below, we investigate the interaction process and 
the effects of nonlinearity and cavitation on the nature of deformation of the plate. 
The plate was assumed to be elastic or elastoplastic. Some additional results of the 
investigation of the dynamics of cavitation zones, and the effects of the nonlinearity 
and the thickness of the plate on the displacements and the pressure in the liquid are 
presented in [18,19,25].
Elastic plate. Steel plates with R = 10 cm and variable thickness were examined. The 
calculations were made at the time step τ = 0.1 – 0.4 cm c0, hx = 0.8 cm, h

r =

p = −1 kg/cm2

, and c0 = 1460 m/s (hx and hr are the grid steps). The column of liquid 
above the plate was taken as infinite.
Figure 4.23 presents the results obtained for h = 0.1 cm. The pressure in the wave 
(4.29) and (4.30) was determined from the following parameters: A = 900 kg/cm2, 
β = 0.07 cm−1, α = −0.4 cm−1, and t1
0
= 10 cm c . The positions of the cavitation 
zones in the water volume bounded by the wall, the bottom, and the axis of the cylin-
der are shown. Cavitation began at the surface of the plate at t = 10 cm c0, and then, 
the cavitation zone grew rapidly. According to the calculation, its thickness attained 
8 cm with t = 12 cm c0, then the zone moved upward, while up to t = 20 cm c0,

Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
its volume remained practically unchanged. The size of the zone decreased when 
t
c
= 24 cm
0 , and then, it vanished.
Calculations revealed that the dimensions of the cavitation zone and the time 
of its existence depend on the length of the incident wave. When the wavelength 
increases, the thickness of the cavitation zone and the time of its existence increase.
The effect of cavitation on nonlinear deformation of the plate was investigated. 
The results confirm the conclusion about the increased influence of cavitation on 
deformation with decreasing ratio of the time of action of the incident wave to the 
period of the natural vibrations of the obstacle. This influence may be substantial 
both with large deflection and with deflection not exceeding the thickness of the 
plate. In the case of sufficiently short waves, the influence of cavitation is always 
substantial. Calculations showed that the geometric nonlinear terms in Eqs. (4.20) 
have to be taken into account only for very large displacements.
Elastoplastic plate. First, we present a comparison between results of calcula-
tions and experimental data. The latter are obtained with the help of the apparatus 
shown in Figure 4.8. The weight of the piston was 13 kg, and the height of the liq-
uid column was 50 cm. The impact velocity on the water was 2 m/s. In Figure 4.24 
[17–19], the results for a bronze alloy plate (h = 1 mm) are presented. The dashed 
curves are calculated according to the elastic model of the plate material, and the 
solid curves are calculated by means of the elastic–plastic model. The thick solid 
line for the pressure p is calculated at the plate center. The curve A represents the 
displacement w measured near the plate center. The thin solid curve A is the pressure 
measured in the water at a distance of about 1.5 cm from the plate center.
One can see that there is a good qualitative agreement between the experimental 
data and the calculations done according to the elastic–plastic model. The lifetime 
of the cavitation zones is determined by the intervals between the peaks in the pres-
sure curves. It is seen that the locations of the peaks and the cavitation zones on the 
pressure curves practically coincide. The elastic model may be used only to predict 
the first moments of the interaction. The maximum displacement of the elastic plate, 
however, is close to the residual displacement of the elastic–plastic plate.
We recall that the deformation sensors used in the experiments practically do 
not fix the initial movement of the plate. Therefore, for small deformations, we have 
a strong discrepancy in the experimental and theoretical values of deflections, as 
FIGURE 4.24 A comparison of measured and calculated data for a thin metal plate.

shown in Figs. 18. 20, 18. 22, and 18. 24. With increasing deflection of the plate, this 
inaccuracy associated with the initial motion of the center of the plate, when it moves 
practically without deforming, decreases.
Let us consider the cases of large plastic displacements of the plate (R = 5.5 cm, 
alloy D16AT) and make a comparison of them with the calculations. The below the 
values of residual displacements found experimentally [20] (numerator) and theoreti-
cally (denominator) are shown for case M = 2.3 kg, ν0 = 32 m/s, L = 50 cm, amplitude 
of the compression wave in the liquid 503 kg/cm2, and the water column length 50 cm:

It can be seen that the results of experiments and calculations correlate well enough. 
The effects of cavitation are demonstrated in Figures 4.25 and 4.26 [25].
The curves of displacement of the plate in Figure 4.25 are not to scale. Smaller 
weight and higher speed of the piston increased the effect of cavitation. Figure 4.26 
shows the curves of deflection calculated for M = 0.3 kg, h = 0.1 cm, hx = 0.2 cm, 
L = 18 cm, and τ = 0.1 cm c0 , taking and not taking cavitation into account. In the 
cases ν0 = 32, 50, and 70 m/s, the amplitudes of the waves in the water were 482, 
754, and 1050 kg/cm2, respectively; since the weight of the piston is constant, the 
wavelength did not change. Because of the instability of the calculations, curve 3ʹ 
could be plotted only up to t = 32 m/s. The curves in Figure 4.26, obtained with and 
without taking cavitation into account, differ substantially from each other. Taking 
cavitation into account improved the stability of the numerical algorithm and made 
it possible to examine the case ν0 = 70 m/s, which could not be calculated on the 
basis of the model of perfectly elastic liquid. This last circumstance is apparently

connected with the large negative pressures and strong variability of the functions 
arising in the calculations; this led to reduced accuracy of the difference operators, a 
cumulation of errors, and instability of the calculations.
Comment to this section. It was shown that the hull cavitation can have a large 
effect on the transient structure–liquid interaction. Therefore, any comparison of 
experiments and calculations interests us. Figure 4.27 shows the comparison.
Figure 4.27 shows the final plastic displacement of the middle section of metal 
plates (width = 78 mm, length = 78 mm, thickness = 0.6 mm) loaded by underwater 
shock wave having different energy contents E. The numerical calculations were 
made using the 2D cavitation model proposed by Galiev [17,25] (curve 1), Shauer’s 
model [16] (curve 2), and the model of an ideally elastic liquid (curve 3). The experi-
mental data are represented by the dots. It can be seen that cavitation can increase the 
final displacement of the plate by a factor of 2–3. Curve 1 describes the experimental 
data very well. Shauer’s model (curve 2) is valid only for small plastic deformation.

4.5  MODELING OF EXTREME WAVE CAVITATION 
AND COOL BOILING IN TANKS
Speaking about gas-hydroelastic system, we mean a structure that interacts substan-
tially with both gas located in liquid and the liquid. Simple example of such con-
structions is a container containing bubbly liquids. In this section, we present the 
results of a numerical study of the unsteady interaction of a bubble liquid with an 
elastic bottom of a cylindrical tank.
Generally speaking in this case, the formulation of the problem given in Section 
4.4.3 partly remains valid. However, the equations describing the waves in the cavi-
tating fluid must be replaced by the equations for a bubble liquid. In view of what has 
been said, we do not give here a complete mathematical formulation of the problem. 
It suffices to introduce equations describing waves in a bubbly mixture. Such equa-
tions were considered in Section 1.4 and Chapter 3. We assume that the flow of the 
mixture is potential and is described by the following equation:

in unit volume of the mixture. If n = 0, then (4.34) corresponds to the model of 
ideal liquid. Oscillations of radius of bubbles are described by the Rayleigh equation

It should be noted that Eqs. (4.34) and (4.35) were written with the following 
assumptions:
	
1. The bubbles do not interact;
	
2. The number of bubbles does not change; that is, they do not merge or 
subdivide;
	
3. There is no relative motion of the bubbles in the liquid.
The results of calculations are given when the non-wetted surface of the plate or free 
surface of a liquid (4.19) is subjected to a pressure pulse:

The first integral (4.38) can also be used in the case of variable pressure p. 
To do this, we subdivide the time interval of motion of the bubble into a 
finite number of time steps.
Here, we assume that the pressure changes suddenly from step to step while 
remaining constant in each time layer. Data from calculations made for the 
previous step is used as the initial conditions for the next integration step. 
This allows us to determine C with allowance for the next integration step.

4.5.1  iMpacT loading of a Tank
We studied an influence of gas concentration and bubble dynamics on defor-
mation of the tank. Considering problems were solved by the finite difference 
method. Using of it was described earlier.
Influence of gas content. Calculations were made assuming that the volume con-
tent of gas in the mixture does not change with time and is equal to G = 1.2 × 10−4 
or G = 10−3. For the indicated values G, sound velocities in the medium were equal 
to 918 and 320 m/s, correspondingly. First, the tank dynamics was calculated using 
the ideal liquid model, and the presence of gas was taken into account by the cor-
responding setting of the speed of sound.
Figure 4.28 shows the variation in the displacement of the central point of the 
plate as a function of time and gas content, calculated for the case of impulse load-
ing of the steel bottom with a thickness of 0.1 cm and R = 5.5 cm [19]. The amplitude 
of the load (4.36) was 2 MPa. The plate in this and other variants of the calculation 
was divided into 15 parts, the numerical step along the mixture column was 0.05 cm, 
and the time step was 0.3 × 10−6 seconds. Curve 1 was constructed for a pure liquid, 
and curves 2 and 4 for G = 1.2 × 10−4 and G = 10−3, respectively. Comparison of 
these curves shows that the plate deflection is essentially dependent on the gas con-
tent. Moreover, deflections also increase with increasing G. An increase in the plate 
radius by a factor of 6 did not change these results.

123
Extreme Effects and Waves
Thus, the presence of a gas in a liquid even in a very small amount (G = 1.2 × 10−4 
and G = 10−3) leads to a very significant (in two and three times) growth of deflec-
tions in the considered case.
Influence of dynamics and concentration of bubbles. Let the concentra-
tion of bubbles n = 103 in 1 cm3. The initial radii of the bubbles that correspond to 
G = 1.2 × 10−4 and G = 10−3 are R

the formula R

. The curves of tank bottom displacements calcu-
lated according to the indicated values are shown in Figure 4.28 by numbers 3 and 
5. Comparing these curves with curves 2 and 4, calculated for a constant gas content 
G, we notice a significant influence of bubble dynamics on the tank behavior. For 
G = 10−3, the model of undeformable bubbles leads to an increase in the displace-
ments by a factor of 3.5. If the oscillations of bubbles are taken into account, an 
increase in the displacements is by a factor 4.9 as compared with the case of pure liq-
uid (curve 1). It is emphasized that during above calculations, the linearized Rayleigh 
equation was used.
We note that the effect of the nonlinearity of the oscillations of the bubbles on the 
deformation of the bottom was also studied. Allowance for the nonlinearity of these 
oscillations led in the cases considered above to an increase in the displacement by 
8%–10% (compare the interrupted curve 6 and curve 5). With an increase in the ini-
tial size of the bubbles, the effect of their nonlinearity increased. Figure 4.28 shows 
the curves calculated for G = 0.5 × 10−2 according to the linearized A and nonlinear 
B equations of bubble dynamics. The maximum divergence of the curves A and B 
reaches 15%.
Thus, the calculations showed that the influence of the bubble nonlinearity on the 
deformation of the structure is not very significant. The deformation of the structure, in 
addition to the gas content and bubble oscillations, is influenced by the dimensions of 
the bubbles. Large but rarely placed bubbles have little effect on the unsteady behavior 
of bubble-hydroelastic systems. When the bubbles and the distance between them are

reduced, the dynamics of the bubbles begins to influence the displacement more and 
more strongly. However, if the bubbles become very small, then the stiffness of them 
becomes significant and the influence of the oscillations of the bubbles can be neglected.
4.5.2  iMpacT loading of liquid in a Tank
We studied the case of impact loading of tank bottom. Let us consider the impact 
loading of water surface containing in the tank. The method of research is not 
changed. The pressure acting on the liquid surface is illustrated in (4.36). Our aim is 
to study waves of cavitation and cool boiling in the liquid.
Figure 4.29 shows curves depicting the change in displacement of the central 
point of the plate [19]. We varied the height of the column of liquid H in the calcula-
tions. Curve 1 was constructed for a pure liquid with H = 15 cm, while curve 2 was 
constructed with the same value of H but with allowance for cavitation. It is evident 
that curves 1 and 2 are quite different. To understand these results, we conducted 
tests with H = 50 cm. It is intuitively clear that an increase in the height of the liquid 
column should not appreciably affect the deformation of the tank bottom for the 
given load. In the last case, curve 3 was constructed for a pure liquid, while curve 4 
was constructed for a liquid in which cavitation may occur. It should be noted that 
curves 2 and 4 nearly coincide for different values of H.
The same cannot be said about curves 1 and 3. The displacement of curve 2 rela-
tive to curve 4 is connected with the fact that the compression wave in the liquid 
reaches the plate later when H = 50 cm than when H = 15 cm.
Thus, it can be concluded that the data calculated from the cavitation model 
agrees well with intuitive predictions. We repeated the calculations using a bubbly 
liquid model. The results obtained are plotted in Figure 4.29 as curves A and B. It is 
seen that they almost coincided with curves 2 and 4, respectively.
FIGURE 4.29 Change in displacements of the plate center over time: (1, 3) model of ideal 
liquid; (2, 4) model of liquid with cavitation; (A) bubbly liquid (H = 15 cm); (B) bubbly liquid 
(H = 50 cm).

125
Extreme Effects and Waves
It is emphasized that in Figure 4.29, curves 1 and 3 are located above curves 2, 
4, A and B, which are calculated for not perfectly elastic liquids. This does not cor-
respond to the results given in the previous sections of this chapter, according to 
which the account of cavitation phenomena increases the deflection. However, the 
last results were obtained for the case of the absence of influence on the plate of other 
deformable liquid boundaries. Thus, changing the boundaries of the liquid volume 
can greatly affect the dynamic destruction of liquids in tanks and its deformation.
The low degree of accuracy of the results calculated according to the model of an 
ideal elastic fluid is connected with the effect of boundaries on the repeated reflec-
tions of compression waves in the liquid (liquid oscillations in the tank). The greater 
such re-reflections, naturally the less accurate the calculations. In connection with 
this, it is interesting to compare compression waves in different models of the liquid. 
Figure 4.30 shows the propagation of these waves in the liquid column.
Let us analyze this figure. We proceed from the fact that during the time of the 
action of the pulse, a compression wave is excited in the liquid, the length of which 
is less than 15 cm. That is, in all variants of calculation, the wavelength is less than 
H. Therefore, when the free surface is unloaded, a rarefaction wave is formed. It is 
similar to that excited in solids after short-time loads (see Chapter 22). After the 
beginning of the interaction of the compression wave with the plate, a second rar-
efaction wave propagates from the bottom.
FIGURE 4.30 Waves calculated according to different models of the liquid.

126
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
This is illustrated by the diagrams of the pressure variation across the liquid col-
umn calculated for the instants of time 1.5 × 10−4, 3 × 10−4, and 4.5 × 10−4 seconds. 
Curves 1–3 correspond to the three points of time, and in the ideal fluid model, 
curves 1ʹ–3ʹ correspond to the model of the liquid to be destroyed.
According to the latest model, the wave processes in the liquid are damped at the 
moment 4.5 × 10−4. It does not agree with the model of an ideal fluid. In accordance 
with the last model, a rarefaction wave propagates from the plate and, after reach-
ing the free surface, becomes a compression wave. It is shown in Figure 4.30 for the 
moment 7.5 × 10−4 (curve 4).
We repeated the calculations using a bubbly liquid model. The results obtained 
are plotted in Figure 4.29 as curves A and B. In Figure 4.30, the results are plotted as 
1″ (t = 1.5 × 10−4 s), 2″ (t = 3 × 10−4 s), and 3″ (t = 4.5 × 10−4 seconds) [19]. It is seen 
that curve 3″ almost coincided with curve 3′.
Thus, the cavitation and bubble models are in good agreement with each other.
It is evident that curves 2ʹ and 3ʹ, constructed with the use of the model consider-
ing the possibility of cavitation, differ from curves 2 and 3, constructed from the 
pure liquid model.
The difference can be attributed to the fact that the cavitation model limits the 
increase in negative pressures in the liquid. The inaccuracy of the ideal model 
in the solution of hydroelastic problems is reinforced in our example due to the 
repeated reflections of the compression waves from the free surface where cavita-
tion effects are strong.
Thus, calculations show that in the design of structures interacting with a liquid, 
it is necessary to consider the development of cavitation and cool boiling in the liq-
uid. Ignoring such phenomena will lead to inaccurate calculations and an inaccurate 
physical representation of the problem.
In particular, we found that even a small amount of gas in the liquid has a sig-
nificant effect on the deformation of structures holding a bubble-containing liquid.
Influence of the bubble screen. The effect of bubble screen on the displacement of 
the tank bottom was investigated. A bubble screen with a 10 cm thickness was placed 
20 cm from the bottom. The amplitude of the impulse load applied to the free surface 
of the liquid does not change (2 MPa). Calculations showed that the bubble screen 
reduced the maximum displacement by 20% compared to the case of pure liquid.
Numerical experiments showed the possibility of controlling the behavior of 
hydroelastic systems using bubble screens. In the cases considered, the wavelength 
after the passage of the screen increased, but the amplitude and velocity of propaga-
tion of the wave decreased. The screen changed the wave properties of the system.

5.1  INTERACTION OF A CYLINDRICAL SHELL WITH 
UNDERWATER SHOCK WAVE IN LIQUID
Let us consider the action of a wave on the lateral surface of a circular cylindrical 
shell immersed in water. The wave front moves perpendicular to the axis of the shell 
(Figure 5.1).
Basic equations. The equations of motion of an infinite cylindrical shell (a ring) 
follow from Section 1.5 if we put in the last u = 0, kx = 0, and ky = 0 and introduce a 
circle coordinate ϕ. Discarding the nonlinear terms in the equations and taking into 
account the equality to zero of the axial derivative, we obtain

Results of calculations. The influence of cavitation on the pressure field in the 
liquid and shell displacements was investigated. The results are presented in [17,18]. 
Here, we only discuss the effect of cavitation on the change in pressure on the shell 
surface and its deflections.
Calculations were made for a cylinder made of borosilicate glass: (E = 6650 
kg/cm2, ν = 0.2, ρ = 2.23 g/cm3, R = 1 m, and h = 0.01 m). The sound speed c0 was 
equal 1500 m/s, the pressure A = 100 kg/cm2, α = −3 cm−1, and β = −5 cm−1.
It was found that the presence of the deformable shell qualitatively changes the 
pressure in the liquid. The deformability of the shell leads to a strong drop in pres-
sure on the shell and to overtaking by the pressure wave of the front of the incident 
wave. The pressure in the rarefaction zones according to the model of an ideal fluid 
falls below −110 kg/cm2. Accounting for cavitation leads to smoothing of the pres-
sure curves calculated taking into account the interaction and the disappearance of 
strong liquid motion along the cylindrical surface.

129
Shells and Cavitation Waves
The displacement w calculated for different instants of time is given in Figure 5.1. 
The dashed lines are constructed without taking into account cavitation, while solid 
lines taking into account cavitation for three different time instants. In each instant, 
the solid lines lie below the dashed ones. The effect of cavitation on w increases 
with time. The excess of w calculated with allowance for cavitation over the value 
found using the ideal liquid reaches 40%. The latest results are in accordance with 
those obtained for the plates. Cavitation limits the values of negative pressures in the 
liquid. Therefore, w found taking into account the finite strength of the liquid in the 
rarefaction zones exceeds w found for the ideal liquid.
The appearance of extremely low pressures shows the inapplicability of the model 
of the ideal liquid to a given problem.
5.2  EXTREME WAVES IN CYLINDRICAL ELASTIC CONTAINER
We examine the reaction of two coaxial cylindrical shells, separated with a liquid 
layer, to pulsed loading applied on part of the surface of the external shell (Figure 5.2). 
The problem is examined in the two-dimensional formulation. Movement of the shells 
is determined by the equations written in relation to the displacements, whereas the 
behavior of the liquid is described by hydrodynamic equations rewritten for potential 
motion. The problem is solved by the finite-difference method.
The effects of nonlinearity of liquid on the properties of considered system are 
studied.

On the surface of the shells, conditions of impenetrability are recorded that have

A part of the external surface of the structure is subjected to the effect of a

It is easy to see that the problem formulated for the two coaxial cylindrical shells 
is fully consistent with the case of the tank considered in Section 4.5. Therefore, we 
will not stop on details of boundary and initial conditions and numerical method of 
solution. We note just that the problem was solved by the finite-difference method. 

131
Shells and Cavitation Waves
Calculations were made for steel shells at R1 = 50 cm, h1 = 0.5 cm and R2 = 100 cm, 
h2 = 0.3 cm.
The loading time was 2.6 × 10−4 s. The main calculations were made when the 
liquid region was divided by radii into 13 parts, and by the angle into 30 parts, and 
when the time step was τ = 10−6 s. In this case, high accuracy of calculations was 
provided.
Model of liquid with cavitation. First, we appreciate the use of the model of 
the instantly destructible (cavitation) liquid. Corresponding equations of Section 5.1 
were used. We give some results of the calculations. The curves of the changes in 
deflections of frontal points of shells are shown in Figure 5.2 [19]. The amplitude 
of the impulse load is A = 1 MPa. It can be seen that curve 2 obtained using the 
cavitation liquid model differs substantially from curve 1 obtained using the ideal 
liquid model. We note that an increase in the pulse amplitude to 5 MPa increased the 
mismatch of the maximum values of w calculated using the two above-mentioned 
liquid models. So, for t = 7 × 10−4 s in the case of A = 1 MPa for the outer shell, the 
mismatch was 25%, and for the inner shell, the mismatch was 30%. In the case of 
A = 5 MPa for the outer shell, the mismatch was 32%, and for the inner shell, the 
mismatch was 45%.
The wave character of the variation of curve 1 in Figure 5.2 is connected with the 
use of the ideal fluid model. This model leads to an accumulation of errors at each 
wave reflection from the boundaries (shells).
Thus, the calculation for two coaxial cylindrical shells confirmed the earlier con-
clusion (Section 4.5) that in cases of deformable containers, the ideal liquid model 
should be approached with even greater caution than in cases of undeformable 
boundaries or infinite liquid.
Influence of the cool boiling. We assume that the liquid between the cylindrical 
shells in the initial state is saturated with bubbles of gas of radius R = 2.25 × 10−5 cm 
in a concentration n = 103 of 1 cm. Such gas volume content in a liquid has practi-
cally no effect on the sound speed, which is 1490 m/s. The specified amount of gas 
in the liquid in the initial state can be considered perfectly clean. On the passage 
of the compression wave, this gas content does not exert any influence. But when a 
pressure wave is reflected from deformable obstacles, a rarefaction wave appears in 
which the gas bubbles begin to grow rapidly, changing the mechanical characteris-
tics of the liquid medium and thus affecting the deformation of the structure.
The results of calculations using the bubbly liquid model are shown in Figure 5.2 
by curve A. In the calculations, the linearized Rayleigh equation was used. To illus-
trate the accuracy of the calculations in Figure 5.2, curve C is plotted for the shell 
using the nonlinear Rayleigh equation.
From the analysis of the curves, it follows that taking into account the presence of 
bubbles in the liquid (in the indicated amount they are always present there) leads to 
a significant change in the nature of shell deformation. We emphasize that results of 
the calculations using the bubble and cavitation liquid models practically coincided, 
although their results were very different from the results using the ideal fluid model.
The curves of the deformation of the frontal point of the inner shell are shown in 
Figure 5.3.

132
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
Curves 1–4 correspond to A = 1 MPa, while curves 5–8 correspond to A = 5 MPa. 
Curves 1 and 5 are calculated using the ideal fluid model, curves 2 and 6 are calcu-
lated using the cavitation liquid model, and curves 3, 7, and 4, 8 are calculated using 
the bubbly liquid model. Moreover, curves 3 and 7 are calculated on the assumption 
that the bubble can be reduced to volume much smaller then its original size. Curves 
4 and 8 are calculated on the assumption that the bubble can be reduced only to its 
original size. Note that in the case R
R
<
0, the computation requires very small steps 
in time, and the accuracy of the calculations decreases.
The curves of the deformation of the frontal points of the outer (a) and inner (б) 
shells, as well as the pressure change curves at the point of the liquid lying opposite 
the frontal point of the inner shell, calculated for the case A = 100 MPa are given in 
Figure 5.4. Curves 1, 2, and 3 were obtained using the ideal, cavitation, and bubbly 
liquid models, respectively [19].
Curves 1 were calculated using the time step τ = 10−6. Curves 2 were calculated 
using τ = 10−6 /2.
The strong nonlinearity of bubble oscillations in the case of curve 3 required a 
reduction in time step. For the latter case, it was equal τ = 10−6 /2.7. We emphasize 
that a further decrease τ to τ = 10−6 3 and τ = 10−6 4 worsened the accuracy of the 
calculations (curves 3′ and 3″ in Figure 5.4, respectively).
We note that the bubble calculations for A = 100 MPa were made by the Runge–
Kutta method. Other algorithms considered in [19] for such A turned out to be 
FIGURE 5.3 Effects of the amplitude of the impulse load and the used liquid model on the 
deflection of the inner shell.

133
Shells and Cavitation Waves
unsuitable. Note that the difference between the minimum and the maximum values 
of the radius of the bubble strongly depended on A. At A of the order of 1 MPa, this 
difference was 2–3 times; at A of the order of 10 MPa, it reached 4 times; and at A of 
the order of 100 MPa, it reached 6–7 times. We also note that the displacements in 
Figure 5.4 far exceed the thickness of the shells and, therefore, should be calculated 
from nonlinear theories of shells. This was not done here since the inaccuracy in the 
calculation of the shells does not affect the basic conclusion about the applicability 
of various liquid models.
5.2.2  feaTureS of BuBBle dynaMicS and Their effecT on ShellS
Calculations showed the complexity of the influence of bubbles on the behavior of 
the system under consideration. As an example of this complexity, we give here some 
results of calculations for uniformly distributed bubbles and bubble screens [27].
Evenly distributed bubbles. We emphasize that we are interested here in the 
influence of cavitation and bubbles on the construction. We will continue to consider 
the action on the shells of a pulse that is triangular in time. The amplitude of the 
pulse A varied from 1 to 20 MPa. The gas content was 1% of the volume of the liquid. 
The presence of gas led to the fact that in the case of an amplitude of 1 MPa, the pres-
sure wave did not reach the inner shell and it remained undeformed. With an increase 
in A up to 5 MPa and higher, the inner shell begins to deform, and its displacements 
begin to exceed the displacements obtained according to the ideal liquid model.
The effect of the amplitude on the speed of propagation of waves in a bubble 
liquid should be emphasized. At amplitudes of 5, 10, and 20 MPa, the velocity of the 
emerging wave in water was 500, 700, and 1000 m/s, respectively (for pure water, 
it was 1500 m/s). Bubbles also strongly influenced the shape of the pressure waves 
arising between the shells.
FIGURE 5.4 Displacement of the internal shell and variation in pressure.

134
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
Figure 19.5a shows waves qualitatively formed in an ideal liquid (solid line) and 
bubble liquid (dashed line). It can be seen that a two-velocity wave appears in the 
bubble liquid (the wave is “torn” into two unequal parts having different amplitudes 
and moving at different speeds) [27]. In particular, at A = 10 MPa, the velocities of 
these waves were c1 = 700 m/s and c2 = 330 m/s, and their amplitudes were 16 and 
3 MPa. If A = 20 MPa, we found c1 = 1000 m/s and c2 = 670 m/s, and 32 and 12 MPa, 
respectively. It is interesting that the amplitude of the first, more “fast” wave in the 
medium is more than 1.5 times higher than the maximum value of the external 
action, while in the case of an ideal liquid, the pulse passes into the liquid without 
changing the amplitude.
Calculations have shown that a decisive role in the formation of a two-speed wave 
is played by a term in the Rayleigh equation (5.10) that takes into account the accel-
eration of the walls of the bubble. Thus, the appearance of the peaks is associated 
with the vibration motion of the bubbles. Curves 1, 2, and 3 are calculated for differ-
ent versions of the Rayleigh equation. In particular, curve 1 corresponds to

Wave processes in the presence of bubble screens. We have already noted the 
influence of bubble screens on the behavior of a structure (see Section 4.5.2). Here, 
this effect is additionally investigated. The shell and loading parameters remain the 
same. Amplitude A varied. It was believed that the gas is located in the annular 
regions at different distances from the inner shell. In those places where the gas is 
absent, the liquid was described by the ideal fluid model.
Calculations were made for screens with a thickness of 8 cm with an initial gas 
concentration of 1%, which are located in three places: near the inner shell (1), in the 
middle of the liquid layer (2), and near the outer shell (3).
FIGURE 5.5 Effect of bubble dynamics on the shape and velocity of waves in a liquid. (a) 
shows qualitatively waves formed in an ideal liquid (solid line) and bubble liquid (dashed 
line). (b) Curves 1, 2, and 3 are calculated for different versions of the Rayleigh equation [27].

135
Shells and Cavitation Waves
Figure 5.6 shows the change in the deflections of the frontal point of the inner 
shell in time for the three above-mentioned screen locations. Two loading cases were 
considered: weak (A = 1 MPa) and strong (A = 20 MPa).
It turned out that for large A, the arrangement of the screens does not significantly 
affect the deformation of the inner shell. For small A, the maximum deflection of the 
inner shell is when the screen is located in the middle of the liquid layer. If the screen 
location is near the inner shell, then not only the size of the deflection, but also its 
sign is changed. The shell first protrudes outward and then begins to move toward 
the center of curvature.
A wave of small amplitude after the passage of the gas layer almost completely 
disappeared, while a strong wave could amplify almost twice in the layer [27].
5.3  EXTREME WAVE PHENOMENA IN THE 
HYDRO-GAS-ELASTIC SYSTEM
Неrе, we continue our consideration of cylindrical shells. In contrast to Section 5.2, 
liquid motion is described by the equations of the hydrodynamics [19,27–29]. The 
effects of the reduction (increase) in the loaded section of the external shell and also 
those of the nonlinearity of the hydrodynamic equations on the deformed state of the 
examined system are considered.

used in Tait’s form (1.36). This equation can be used to examine the propagation of 
waves with relatively high amplitudes (to 3000 MPa) in the liquid.

Cavitation arose if the pressure at the point of the liquid dropped below the critical 
value. In cavitation zones, the pressure was equal to zero. Cavitation at the point of 
the liquid disappeared if there, according to the calculation, the pressure exceeded 
the critical value. In general, the described algorithm corresponds to the one used 
in the case of potential fluid motion (Section 4.4.3).
Parameters of the load and the shells are described in Section 5.2.1. The results of 
some numerical investigations are presented below.
Results of calculations. Figure 5.8 shows the curves of the radial  displacements of

Solid curves correspond to the external shell, while the broken curves correspond to 
the internal shell. Point T1 on the abscissa in Figure 5.8 corresponds to the end of the 
loading. Consequently, the deformation time of the structure is considerably longer 
than the loading time. The load amplitude A = 1000 MPa.

Shells and Cavitation Waves
Deformation of the outer shell with respect to the angle is represented in Figure 5.9 
[27–29]. Solid and broken lines denote the displacements for the moments shown by 
points T2 and T3 in Figure 5.8. Curves 1 (and 1′), 2 (2′), 3 (3′) and 4 (4′) correspond to 
L = π, 5 /
π
π
6, 2 /3, and 7π/12 in (5.14). Namely, curves 1–4 correspond to the instant 
T2, while curves 1′–4′ the instant T3.
It can be seen that the variation in the loading area has a strong effect on the nature 
of deformation of the external shell, with the smallest deflections detected at large 
and small loading areas. This is associated with the fact that the stress state at the 
large loading area is close to the momentless (membrane) state, whereas in the case 
of the small loading area, the applied pulse is insufficient to cause extensive deforma-
tion of the structure. Maximum displacements occur when the pulse of the forces is 
sufficiently intensive and the stress state of the shell greatly differs from the stress 
state of the membrane. The dimensions of the loading area have almost no effect on 
the deformation of the internal shell. The stress state of the internal shell is close to 
that of the membrane shell for all loading cases: the loading of the external shell is 
local, while the loading of the internal shell is not local since the wave excited in the 
liquid diverges. Consequently, the deflection of the internal shell does not depend on 
the method of load application but increases when the load area is increased.
The displacements of the shells did not exceed half the thickness. This justifies 
the use of the equations of the linear shell theory.
According to the calculations, deformation of the walls in the liquid leads to the 
formation of the zones of negative pressures (Figure 5.10) [29]. The rarefaction forms 
in the vicinity of the point θ = 0 of the external shell. Then, with decreasing strain rate, 
the rarefaction forms in the zone adjacent to this shell. In the internal shell, the negative

pressures formed only in the vicinity of the front point. It should be mentioned that 
regardless of the large dimension of the rarefaction zone, the absolute values of the neg-
ative pressures in the vicinity of the front point are considerably lower than those of the 
pressures in the compression zones. However, these values are sufficient for cavitation 
to take place. The appearance of cavitation was taken into account using the method 
described above. The effect of cavitation on the given loads and parameters of the shells 
resulted in a slight (5%–15%) reduction in the displacement of the external shell and an 
increase in the displacement of the internal shell. The results similar to those shown in 
Figure 5.10 were also obtained for other cases of the loading areas of the external shell.
5.4  EFFECTS OF BOILING OF LIQUIDS WITHIN 
RAREFACTION WAVES ON THE TRANSIENT 
DEFORMATION OF HYDROELASTIC SYSTEMS
The above-presented calculations of transient deformations of the systems are based 
on the so-called normal conditions for a liquid. However, the structures fairly often 
contain either very hot liquids under high static pressures or liquefied gases (nitro-
gen, oxygen, helium, etc.) [30,31].
Using our previously developed methods, we will investigate here the transient 
deformation of two coaxial cylindrical shells, separated by a liquid at a high tempera-
ture, under the action of sources of pressure waves in the liquid. Moreover, examples 
of calculation of impulse deformation of shells containing cryogenic liquids are given. 
We will consider the effect of the boiling-up of liquefied helium, nitrogen, and oxygen 
in low-pressure waves on the behavior of cylindrical shells bounding these media. 
The effect of the temperature of the shells on their deformation is not considered.
The problems stated above are reduced to the simultaneous solution of linear equa-
tions from the moment theory of shells and conservation equations from liquid mechan-
ics. For describing the thermodynamic behavior of liquids heated to a high temperature 
that were initially under high hydrostatic pressure in a state close to boiling, we use the 
equations, which hold in a wide range of liquid parameters for a condensed, two-phase, 
or gaseous state of the medium; the temperature is assumed to be constant.
The calculations were made for steel shells. A detailed analysis of the effect of 
the grid dimensions, the convergence criterion, and the stability on the calculation 
accuracy is given in [30,31].
Behavior of shells containing a heated liquid and sources of pressure waves. 
Water is the most widely used coolant in practice. Therefore, water in the state close 
to boiling was considered as the heated liquid. Water can remain in a liquid state up 
to very high temperatures (>600°K) if it is kept under high pressure.
The radius and the thickness of the inner shell are assumed to be equal to 0.5 
and 0.01m, and those of the outer shell, 1 and 0.01 m, respectively. Assume that at 
t = 0, the water temperature is everywhere, with the exception of certain volumes 
(perturbation sources), equal to 500°K and that the static pressure is equal to 5 MPa. 
The  initial temperature and the initial pressure of the medium in these volumes 
(sources) are equal to 600° and 20 MPa, respectively. The perturbation sources are 
located in the middle between the shells.

140
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
We consider the cases of one and two sources. We assume that there is not enough 
time for the thermal conductivity processes to manifest themselves during the strain-
ing of the structure; that is, the temperature of the medium in the sources and the 
surrounding liquid remains at its initial level, regardless of the drastic changes in the 
density and pressure. We assume in calculations that, in the case of a single source, 
it occupies two cells adjacent to the symmetry line θ = π / 2. In the case of two 
sources, they occupy one cell each, which are located symmetrically relative to the 
θ = π / 2 line, and the angle between them is equal to π 3.8.
The aim of the calculations was to illustrate the possibility of numerical anal-
ysis of the thermal shock process within a hydroelastic structure on the basis of 
Kuznetsov’s equations (1.49)–(1.52).
Using the initial values of p and T, we find the value of ρ0 from Eq. (5.16), which 
fully defines the initial conditions necessary for solving the hydrodynamics equations.
Figure 5.11 shows the deflections of the head points in time for the outer and the 
inner shells [27,31]. The initial strained state of the shells is caused by the static 
pressure of the high-temperature liquid. It is evident that there is no difference in 
the character of straining for these shells in the above-mentioned cases. The curves 
have a two-wave character. It should be mentioned that, with respect to the angle, the 
deformations also form a two-wave configuration.
A numerical investigation of the propagation pattern of perturbations throughout 
the liquid has shown that, in the case of a single source, the boiling-up occurs in the 
neighborhood of the head points of the shells due to wall deformation. The boiling-
up zones propagate together with the deformation waves along the shells. In the pres-
ence of two sources, other boiling-up zones besides those mentioned above develop 
in the liquid volume between the sources. This is connected with the fact that two 
hydraulic shocks moving away from the sources collide, after which low-pressure 
zones develop at the point of collision.
Effect of the boiling-up of cryogenic liquids. Cryodynamics, the discipline con-
cerned with dynamic phenomena in cryogenic liquids, promotes new lines of devel-
opment in modern technology and, in particular, facilitates the calculation of shells 
containing nitrogen, oxygen, helium, etc. In order to describe the thermodynamic

The radius and the thickness of the inner shell were assumed to be equal to 0.75 
and 0.02 m, and those of the outer shell, 1 and 0.01 m, respectively [27,31]. The ini-
tial pressure for each liquid exceeded the saturation pressure by a factor of 1/10, 
while the initial temperature was equal to 4/5 × Tcr. The saturation pressure values 
were determined for each medium on the basis of the initial temperature values in 
accordance with data from a manual [32]. The outer shell was subjected to the lat-
eral impulse load with a duration of 300 µs, whose variation in time corresponded 
to an isosceles triangle, while the distribution along the circular coordinate varied 
according to the sinϕ law at the semicircle points 0 ≤
≤
θ
π, and it was equal to zero 
at other points.
Figure 5.12 shows the curves of head point deflections for the shells, calculated 
for a load with an amplitude of 30 MPa. It is evident that the characteristics of the 
outer shell’s deformation are heavily dependent on the liquid filling the cavity. On 
the whole, it can be said that the larger the deflection magnitude, the lower the liquid 
density. At the same time, the displacement of the inner shell is less heavily depen-
dent on the liquid characteristics than that of the outer shell (Figure 5.12). This is 
connected with the specifics of wave generation by the outer shell in various liquids.
Figure 5.13 shows the pressure curves calculated for the vicinity of the head point 
of the inner shell for nitrogen, oxygen, helium, boiling water, and water under normal 
conditions. (The scale of curve 3 along the axis of ordinates is magnified by a factor 
of 4.) Regardless of the considerable differences between the liquid characteristics, 
the amplitudes and shapes of the waves excited in the liquids differ slightly from each 
other. Helium is somewhat of an exception; the wave amplitude for helium amounts 
to approximately one-fourth of that excited in other liquids. However, the wavelength 
of this wave is almost twice as large as the wavelength in oxygen and nitrogen.

142
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
It is evident that if Eq. (5.12) is used, the pressure in cryogenic liquids does not drop 
to considerable negative values. This cannot be said about water. In all these cases, the 
maximum amplitudes of the inner shell’s deflection were approximately equal.
Remark. We examined the wave processes in shock-excited shells containing highly 
heated or cryogenic liquids. Recall that we model the problems using model equations 
describing the properties of liquids. When modeling the behavior of shells, the influence 
of high or low temperatures on the properties of their material is not taken into account.

5.5  A METHOD OF SOLVING TRANSIENT THREE-
DIMENSIONAL PROBLEMS OF HYDROELASTICITY 
FOR CAVITATING AND BOILING LIQUIDS
Numeric methods currently known for the solution of the problems of dynamic 
 cavitation hydroelasticity can be conditionally divided into two groups.
	
1. The first involving direct integration of a system of differential equations in 
partial derivatives, for example, by the finite-difference method for a discrete 
grid. In this case, cavitation can be considered by different means: on the 
basis of a model of instantaneous fluid failure, on the basis of a model of a 
bubble fluid using a nonlinear or linearized Rayleigh equation, etc.
	
2. The second involving the use of expansions of all the unknown and 
known variables in a series of terms of orthogonal functions in terms of 
one of the spatial coordinates with subsequent use of the numeric method. 
This method has been termed numerical–analytical method.
The numerical methods of the first group make it possible to account readily for cavita-
tion effects, but they are uneconomical, since large outlays of online computer memory 
and computer time are required. Numerical–analytical methods that make it possible 
to reduce the dimensions of the problem to unity are more preferable from this stand-
point; with their use, however, it is more difficult to account for cavitation phenomena.
A method for solving 3D physically nonlinear problems of hydroelasticity 
in the cylindrical coordinate system, which is referred to the second group, is 
described below.
5.5.1  governing equaTionS
Cavitation failure of the fluid can be treated as an instantaneous event. The equa-
tion of state of the liquid is shown graphically as the solid line in Figure 5.14. The 
broken line corresponds to Tait’s equation, and the inclined rectilinear segment to 
its linearized variant. The tangent of the angle between the inclined section and the 
horizontal axis is equal to the second degree of the sound speed in the fluid. Let us 
assume that the fluid pressure cannot drop below a certain critical value Pc; this is 
just what makes the problem nonlinear. When crossing the critical point B, the liquid 
is failed by means of cavitational boiling and the pressure inside fluid becomes equal 
to some constant value Ps. Generally, Ps is the pressure of saturated steam. When the 
pressure increases, the liquid restores its continuity again. Thus, the variables varied 
linearly everywhere, with the exception of the vicinity of vertical segment BC, where 
the equation of state is essentially nonlinear.
In this connection, it is necessary to develop an algorithm that makes it possible to 
continue the problem’s solution on passing through the indicated interval BC (from 
the inclined segment to the horizontal one, and conversely).
Let us examine a structure consisting of two coaxial elastic cylindrical shells of 
infinite length, between which a liquid is located. The fluid can be considered non-
viscous, and its motion potential [33].

The displacements of the shells can be considered small. Let us use the cylindri-
cal coordinate system.

The problem was numerically integrated in the following way: wave equation (5.20) 
was satisfied initially for each time interval. If the value of ψ  obtained in this case 
did not satisfy Condition (5.21), the potential was redetermined proceeding from 
Eq. (5.22). This made it possible to account for both the development and disappear-
ance of cavitation at each point in the space of the calculated region.

in detail in [27] and are omitted here. Note that [27] examined the transient cavita-
tion problem. Since cavitation was accounted for by the use of a linearized Rayleigh

tions was dissociated into K + 1 independent two-dimensional systems.
In this paper, the system becomes nonlinear as a result of accounting for cavita-
tion ruptures of the fluid; it is no longer broken down into independent equations, and 
all K + 1 harmonics must be considered jointly for each time increment.
Let us dwell in greater detail on the proposed method of accounting for cavita-

5.5.3  reSulTS and diScuSSion
Bleich–Sandler plate problem [34] was considered to verify the accuracy of using 
mathematical model of the cavitating liquid. The response of a horizontal layer 
of mass on the surface of a half-space of fluid (see Figure 5.15) was determined.

The motion of the mass is of interest. The history of its velocity is shown in 
Figure 5.15. Curve 1 corresponds to Bleich–Sandler one; curve 2 corresponds to 
Galiev’s method with the velocity potential; curve 3 corresponds to Newton’s method 
[35] with the displacement potential; curve 4 corresponds to the ideally elastic fluid.

Shells and Cavitation Waves
The finite-difference grid steps were also chosen in accordance with the recom-
mendations of [34]. In the case of the ideally elastic fluid, the above methods gave 
the same results (as shown in Figure 5.15, curve 4). In the case of cavitation, the 
model with the velocity potential agreed with results of [34], which was worse than 
the model with the displacement potential [35]. Nevertheless, Galiev’s method takes 
into account the main effect of cavitation phenomena. This model had a quite good 
numerical stability (as shown in Figure 5.15). This fact is very important in case of 
2D and especially 3D problems. As it will be shown further, the suggesting model 
(based on the velocity potential) has no difficulties when expanding for 3D problems.
Thus, we additionally estimated a precision of Galiev’s method, which is the basis 
of the new algorithms of this chapter. The accuracy of the algorithm developed by 
the authors was verified using trial calculations.
A two-dimensional method, which makes it possible to calculate coaxial cylindri-
cal shells of infinite length with a cavitating fluid for a non-axisymmetric pulse effect 
(the case when z0 = ∞ in Eq. (5.18)), was described above in detail. This algorithm 
does not assume expansions of the unknowns in trigonometric series: the system of 
differential equations was numerically integrated directly over a two-dimensional 
regular curvilinear grid with rj = const and ϕn = const. This algorithm will here-
inafter be called approach 1, and the 3D method proposed in the present study 
approach 2. The reliability of the results obtained using approach 1 has been con-
firmed earlier, and hereinafter, these results will be used as the data for comparisons.

with the increments hr and hϕ was used in the case of trial calculations made in 
accordance with approach 1, and a rectilinear one-dimensional grid with the incre-
ment hr in the case of trial calculations made in accordance with approach 2; in this 
case, the first eight harmonics were computed since the accounting of 12 harmonics 
altered the results by less than 3%. The ratio of the computer times required for the 
calculations by method 1 or 2 was approximately proportional to the ratio of the 
number of the grid nodes along the angle coordinate to the number of the considered 
harmonics. In the case of z0 < ∞, the length Lc of the computed region was limited 
by assuming L

section z = 0. The time during which the behavior of the structure was investigated 
was rather short (not more than 2 ms); after this period, the excitation from the load 
application point (z
z
<
0 ) could not reach the plane z = Lc; therefore, the selection 
of the boundary condition in this section had no effect on the wave pattern. For the 
simplicity of calculations, the condition of symmetry was used when z = Lc.

pressure in the vicinity of the zone φ = 0, r = 0.6m with time are presented in 
Figure 5.16. It follows from Figure 5.16 that approximately by the time moment 
t = 0.6ms, the excitations reach the rear points of both shells, and when consider-
ing the pipes’ deformed state, it is necessary to take into account the progressive 
motion of the pipes as a unit in the direction of the acting load. It is apparent that 
the results obtained from different approaches are in good agreement. Thus, the 
proposed numerical–analytical method can be used with a rather high degree of 
accuracy for the calculations involving the dynamic behavior of structures contain-
ing a cavitation fluid. When the model of an ideally elastic fluid is used, nonphysical 
spikes of high negative pressure in water, which lead to distorted patterns of defor-
mation of both shells, are seen distinctly.
As an example of the calculation made in accordance with the developed algo-
rithm, let us examine the local loading of a structure by a pulse with the following

Also presented here is the curve of the time t* at which this maximum is attached 
(broken line) versus the quantity A. An interesting fact is that depending on the same 
parameter, the curves have approximately the same character, although the physical 
nature of the quantities which they describe is completely different. A zone of rigor-
ous nonlinearity for small loads compared with Pc  is observed. The nonlinearity of

the curves diminishes sharply with increasing load. In the case of an ideally elastic 
fluid, both curves degenerate into horizontal segments (curve 1 in Figure 5.17).
Isolines of the pressures that develop in the fluid, which are divided by the pulse 
amplitude (nondimensional pressure), are shown in Figure 5.18 for three amplitude 
variants: strong (A = 20MPa), moderate (A = 1MPa), and weak (A = 0.3MPa) 
pulses. Each pattern is plotted at the time t* corresponding to it. When A = 20MPa, 
t* = 1.2ms  and  wmax = 0.00024m; when A = 1MPa, t* = 1.1ms and wmax = 0.00024m; 
and when A = 0.3MPa, t* = 0.71ms and wmax = 0.000036 m. One can see a nonlinear 
dependence of w

left corner in the vicinity of the point with the coordinates r

although the load is initially applied to the outer surface r

In the other zones of the structure, the patterns of pressures and cavitation fail-
ures of the fluid bear little resemblance to one another. Away from the plane ϕ = 0, 
the pressures are damping rapidly. Thus, for an instant, the maximal fluid pressures 
occurring in the plane ϕ = 0 during the whole calculated period (t ≤1.5ms) never 
exceed 6% of the corresponding impulse amplitude.

z axis at different time moments in the planes ϕ =

curves have been drawn for strong and weak pulses. It is apparent that under weak 
impulse, an evident wave propagation of w along the longitudinal axis is observed, 
while in case of strong pulse, this phenomenon disappears almost completely. It hap-
pens, as it seems to us, due to the fact that when the load amplitude increases, the 
ratio of the irreversible energy losses in the cavitational zones to the general impulse 
energy also increases. For a weak pulse, the formation of insignificant corrugation 
in the vicinity of section ϕ = π/2, which dampens rapidly with time, was observed 
in the initial moments of deformation of the inner shell. This effect vanishes for high 
amplitudes.
Thus, a numerical–analytical method was developed for the solution of a si ngle 
class of nonlinear nonstationary three-dimensional problems of hydroelastic-
ity, which employs the expansion of functions in trigonometric Fourier series, the 
FIGURE 5.19 Curves of w versus z in different time moments: (1) – 0.5 ms, (2) – 1 ms, and 
(3) – 1.5 ms for strong (a) and weak (b) pulses.

accuracy of which is proven by numerical experimentation. The suitability of the 
algorithm is demonstrated for the solution of a rather wide range of problems of 
dynamic hydroelasticity with the allowance for cavitation. The method elaborated 
can also be employed for the solution of dynamic problems that are similar to those 
described and take into account failures in solid bodies or their plastic properties.
Conclusion. We carried out in this chapter additional tests of the cavitation mod-
els that showed their acceptable accuracy even when solving complex 3D hydroelas-
ticity problems.

6 Interaction of Extreme 
Underwater Waves 
with Structures
Important elements of structural resistance to the action of an underwater shock 
wave and an underwater explosion are considered. Effects of fracture and cavitations 
are studied. A simple model of the underwater wave is introduced which was formed 
as a result of the explosion. The influence of plastic deformations, large displace-
ments, and reinforcing elements on the deformation of the structure is studied.
6.1  FRACTURE AND CAVITATION WAVES IN 
THIN-PLATE/UNDERWATER EXPLOSION SYSTEM
We will examine a two-dimensional problem concerning the deformation and frac-
ture of an infinite plate lying on a compressible fluid and subjected to hydrodynamic 
shock waves created by the explosion of a cylindrical pentolite charge.
Basic relations. The dynamic behavior of the elastoplastic plate will be described 
by the equations of a geometrically nonlinear theory of thin shells of the Timoshenko 
type (see Section 1.5). We use the equations of motion of the plate written in forces 
and moments (Chapter 1 and [36]):

The Lagrangian approximation was used in (6.5) [37]. We adopt Tait’s form (1.36) as 
the equation of state of the liquid. The axis of symmetry passes through the center 
of the plate, in the direction normal to its surface. At the axis of symmetry, there is 
a volume of the gas of cylindrical form. Its motion is governed by (6.5). The closing 
equations are represented by the adiabatic equations (1.55), where γ = 3. The initial 
speed, pressure, and density of the gas are assumed to be specified. At t = 0, the gas 
volume starts to expand, and the resultant underwater wave and the hydraulic flow 
act on the sheet causing its deformation.
We assume that the explosive transformation of the explosive material and the 
expansion of the detonation products occur in accordance with the scheme of instan-
taneous wave detonation. During detonation, the pressure p0 and the density of the 
detonation products ρ0 – equal to the initial density of the explosive – are instanta-
neously established throughout the volume of the charge.

157
Interaction of Extreme Underwater Waves
The system of equations of hydroelastoplasticity is augmented by boundary and 
initial conditions. We use the condition of impermeability on the contact surface 
between the plate and the liquid, while we apply pressure equal to 1 atmosphere on 
the external surface of the plate. We adopt zero initial conditions (except for pressure 
in its source). The scheme used for numerical solution of the problem is based on the 
Wilkins method [38] and difference relations presented in [37] for determining the 
displacements in thin plates. The simple model of cavitation phenomena in the liquid 
was used. If the pressure drops in a grid cell less than the critical value, it is assumed 
to be equal to some constant.
Plate failure was accounted for by means of the following criterion: if the inten-
sity of the stresses in a plate cell exceeds the ultimate tensile strength of the material, 
this cell is considered to have failed.
Results of calculations. Calculations were performed for a steel plate with a 
thickness h = 0.02 m and for water. The thickness and radius of the pentolite charge 
were assumed to be equal to 0.08 and 0.2 m, respectively. The density of the charge 
was taken to be 1650 kg/m3, the detonation rate 7655 m/s, and the initial pressure 
12 GPa. The symmetry axis of the gaseous region coincides with the symmetry axis 
of the isolated volumes of the plate and water.
The dynamics of the given hydroelastoplastic system can be studied on the basis 
of the above equations if the z axis is directed into the liquid along the symmetry 
axis. All of the other principles underlying the calculation are analogous to those 
described earlier in this chapter.
Let us examine the results of the calculation, in which we varied the distance 
between the gas volume and the plate: d = 12h, 16h, and 20h. First, let us study the 
dynamics of the hydrodynamic shock waves. Figure 6.1 shows diagrams depicting 
the change in the pressure of the underwater wave over time at the point r = 0, z = 0.
FIGURE 6.1 Change in pressure in the liquid at the point r = 0, z = 0.

158
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
These results were calculated for different distances of the gas volume from the 
plate. It can be seen that with increasing distance from the source of the perturba-
tions, peak pressures of the shock wave decay exponentially (dashed lane). Another 
feature of the problem is related to the change in pressure on the plate surface.
Figure 6.2 shows the pattern of peak pressures on the plate surface with d = 16h. 
It is evident that with an increase in r from zero, the pressure acting on the plate 
decreases exponentially.
When the underwater wave had traveled 2.5–3 m on the plate surface, we assumed 
in the calculations that all of the energy of the liquid had been transferred to the 
plate. The calculation was subsequently performed without allowance for the pres-
ence of the liquid, under the influence of inertial forces. During the deformation of 
the plate, a large cavitation region develops in the liquid. This region occupies the 
entire deformed surface of the plate and grows into the liquid. Failure to allow for 
cavitation led to rapidly increasing pressure pulsations and loss of stability of the 
computing algorithm.
Figure 6.3 shows the deformation and fracture regions of the plate (the fractured 
cells in the plate are hatched). Fracture of the plate began at the point r = 0. The 
fracture zone then propagated from the symmetry axis. For example, with d = 12h, 
a plate with the radius r = 0.48 m fractured completely at the moment t = 18 × 10−4 
second (Figure 6.3a). As the distance between the source of the underwater waves 
and the plate increased, the fracture region gradually disappeared and, with d = 20h, 
was not seen at all up to the moment of time t = 44 × 10−4 second [36].
According to the calculations, we can conclude the following: the cavitation zone 
propagates over the plate with a deformation wave while simultaneously developing 
deeper in the liquid; fracture of the plate begins at the point r = 0 and subsequently 
extends from the symmetry axis; it is necessary to allow for cavitation when calcu-
lating large strains of plates exposed to an underwater wave.

6.2  FRACTURE AND CAVITATION WAVES IN PLATE/
UNDERWATER EXPLOSION SYSTEM
Here, we numerically study the dynamic failure of a solid layer lying on a liquid 
under the influence of a rapidly expanding gas bubble in the liquid. We will also 
examine the effect of the distance between the gas bubble and the layer on the fail-
ure of the latter. We consider the possibility of very large displacements of the three 
interacting media (solid, liquid, gas) relative to each other [27,38].
Basic relations. Let a deformable plate of the thickness h lies on the surface of a 
liquid. A volume of gas of cylindrical form is located in the liquid near the plate. We 
will assume that the gas volume begins to expand at a high rate at t = 0.
In solving the problem, it is necessary to consider the interaction of the gasdy-
namic system and the plate, as well as the possibility of very large displacements 
of the different media relative to each other. This can be done on the basis of the 
numerical method of integrating the equations of continuum mechanics described 
in Ref. [38].
The nonsteady interaction of these media is described by using conservation

Since the plate material has shear strength, calculation of yielding in the plate 
involves determination of the stress tensor. This tensor is represented as the sum of 
the spherical and deviatoric terms. The spherical component of the stress tensor –

System (6.6)–(6.11) is closed by the initial and boundary conditions. The initial 
conditions are zero (except for the pressure in the gas). We assumed the existence of 
sliding contact between the plate and the gas–liquid system. We also assumed that 
the external surface of the layer is a free surface.
It should be noted that, in accordance with the Wilkins approach [38], Eqs. (6.6) 
and (6.7) are written on the Lagrangian grid. However, the tensors of strain rate 
(6.9) and stress intensity (6.8) are assumed to be independent of the Eulerian vari-
ables. Such a form of representation is very convenient in the numerical solution 
of dynamic problems. The relationship between the Lagrangian and Eulerian coor-
dinates can be followed during the solution, and small differences between these 
coordinates within a small time interval can be ignored.

161
Interaction of Extreme Underwater Waves
We will not stop on the algorithm for solution of the problem, since the finite-
difference scheme we used was described in detail in Ref. [38].
Cavitation and failure. We should note the possibility of local disturbance of 
the continuity of the liquid (cavitation). A simple model (see Chapter 4) is used to 
allow for cavitation effects. The model is based on the assumption that pressure in 
the theoretical cell is zero if it is less than the critical value.
A large number of mathematical models may be used for the dynamic failure 
of solids (Chapter 2). However, these models usually contain empirical parameters 
that are unknown for many materials; it is difficult to compare models with regard 
to their accuracy. In such cases, it is useful to examine the simplest failure models. 
These models are valid for a broad range of materials and are accurate enough for 
approximate calculations.
Here, we analyzed plate failure by using a simple mechanical criterion of 
 failure [37]. The model on which the construction of this criterion was based assumes 
that if the maximum stress in a microscopic volume of the medium exceeds the 
material critical constant σ cr – representing the tensile strength of the material – then 
a microcrack directed perpendicular to this normal stress instantaneously forms in 
the material. Since the maximum normal stress is one of the principal stresses and 
there are only three principal stresses, the given model allows no more than three 
cracks to develop in the microvolume.
During the numerical calculation, a microvolume of the medium is associated 
with the Lagrangian finite-difference cell, and the initiation of cracks is followed in 
each such cell. In the presence of a crack, the stress normal to its surface is equated 
to zero. We assume that the stresses change due to filling of part of the microvol-
ume with cavities, and the volume of these cavities is regarded as the volume of the 
given crack. This results in a change in the effective strain of the microvolume and 
a corresponding change in the quantities p, σ zz, σ rr, and σ θθ so that they correspond 
to the stresses in the failed material. This sequence of events is based on a linear 
relationship between the stresses and strains in the region bordering the fractured 
material. During the calculations, we follow the change in the volumes of all nucle-
ated cracks. If any of these volumes becomes negative, this is interpreted as welding 
of the crack, and the volume is equated to zero. We will henceforth assume that if a 
compressive stress develops perpendicular to the crack, the material will behave in a 
manner similar to the unfractured material. When a tensile stress develops, the crack 
reopens, and the procedure of observing the change in volume is repeated.
Results of calculations. All of the calculations were performed for a steel plate 
of 0.02 m thickness with the following parameters: density ρ0 = 7850 kg/m3, shear 
modulus μ = 80 GPa, elastic modulus E = 200 GPa, yield point σ0 = 0.6 GPa, tensile 
strength σcr = 1.5 GPa, and a = − b = c = 240 GPa [37]. A gas bubble was formed in 
the explosion of pentolite (a high explosive made up of trotyl and PETN in a 50:50 
ratio) with a density ρ0 = 1650 kg/m3 at a detonation velocity D = 7655 m/s and an ini-
tial pressure p

to be equal to the thickness of the plate.
We established the goal of using numerical calculations to study the effect of the 
method of modeling the interaction of a liquid arid gas with a plate and the distance from 
the gas bubble to the plate on the stress–strain state (SSS) and strength of the plate.

162
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
First, we examined an underwater bubble which expanded on the surface of the 
plate. The effect of the interaction of the liquid and gas with the plate on the char-
acter of the SSS of the latter was evaluated by comparing the results of calculations 
performed with the use of one of the following assumptions:
 
 
 
1. The cells of the solid, liquid, and gas cannot slip relative to each other.
2. The liquid does not slip relative to the contact surface (phase boundary) 
during deformation of the plate, while the gas cells can be displaced relative 
to the cells of the solid.
3. The cells of the solid, liquid, and gas can slip relative to each other.
It was found that the fracture zone of the plate had roughly the same size in all three 
cases. Here, the method used to describe the interaction had a significant effect on 
the pressure in the liquid. For example, the pressure in the neighborhood of the point 
of contact of the liquid, gas, and solid after 4 μs was 3.25, 3.38, and 3.04 GPa in the 
above cases, respectively.
While studying the effect of the distance of the gas bubble from the plate on the 
character of failure of the plate, first we examined the case of explosion on the plate. 
We compared calculations performed for expansion of the gas in a vacuum and in 
the liquid. It turned out that the presence of the liquid increases the amplitude of 
the wave σ z propagating along the z axis by more than 10%–15%. Failure began 
from the free surface. It subsequently propagated from the external surface and the 
symmetry axis. The fracture zones calculated for the case of explosion in a vacuum 
turned out to be larger than those for the case of explosion in the liquid. This has to 
do with the effect on the fracture zone of unloading waves emanating from the gas–
liquid, solid–liquid, gas–vacuum, or solid–vacuum contact surfaces. The amplitude 
of these rarefaction waves will naturally be higher in the latter cases (with a vacuum), 
and this evidently explains the more destructive effect realized for expansion of the 
gas in a vacuum.
Figure 6.4 shows diagrams of the waves in the plate (
)
Σ = −σ z  and in the gas and 
liquid (
)
Σ = p  for different moments of time ant r = 0, with distances between the 
charges and the plate d = 0, 0.02, and 0.03 m. While constructing the curves, we used 
different scales for the coordinate: one unit of length in the gas and liquid regions is 
twice as great as a unit of length in the solid region.
FIGURE 6.4 (a–c) Effect of the distance between the gas and the cylinder on the forma-
tion of waves ∑ and fracture zones in an axial section: I, II, and III are liquid, gas, and solid 
regions, respectively (the asterisks denote fracture zones).

163
Interaction of Extreme Underwater Waves
It can be seen that the size of the fracture zones and the character of wave forma-
tion in the above-examined media depend heavily on the position of the gas bubble 
relative to the plate.
The calculations were performed with and without allowance for cavitation in the 
liquid. The failure processes in the solid and liquid phases were not observed to have 
had any effect on each other.
6.3  GENERATION OF CAVITATION WAVES 
AFTER TANK BOTTOM BUCKLING
We use a numerical approach to analyze the effect of these factors on the nonsteady 
deformation of a spherical panel – the bottom of a conical tank filled with water. 
A gas bubble undergoes rapid expansion near the panel. The motion of the panel is 
described by equations of the Timoshenko type, whereas the motion of the liquid is 
described by the equations of hydrodynamics (see, also, Sections 1.5 and 20.1).
Formulation of the problem. We will assume that the shell is shallow. Its motion 
is determined by nonlinear equations of the Timoshenko type (Section 1.5 and

We use also notations: w and u are the normal and tangential components of the dis-
placement of the middle surface of the shell, ψ is the angle of rotation of the normal 
to the middle surface of the shell, E is the elastic modulus, v is the Poisson’s ratio,

Tait’s equations (1.36) can be used to close Eq. (6.14) in the case of water, whereas 
the equation of the adiabatic curve (6.11) was used in the case of the gas. Cavitation 
effects were considered in accordance with Section 6.2.

to fastening on the contour of the shell. At t = 0, the density of the gases is equal to 
the density of the water. The remaining parameters of the problem remain undis-
turbed at t = 0.
Algorithm for numerical integration. To solve the above-formulated boundary-
value problem, we will use the finite-difference method with an implicit scheme of 
integration over time. We will use the Wilkins scheme to solve equations of flow of 
the liquid and gas (6.14) (see, also, Figure 6.9). The equations of motion of the shell 
will be integrated using an explicit difference scheme [27,39].
Results of calculations [27,39]. The following were taken as the geometric 
dimensions and mechanical characteristics of the shell material (aluminum): R0 = 
0.4 m (R0 is the radius of the shell contour), h = 0.01 m, f = 0.05 m, E = 75,600 MPa, 
and v = 0.3; ρ0 = 2640 kg/m3. The gas bubble is formed on the symmetry axis of the 
tank at a distance of 0.16 R from the pole point of the shell. The volume of the space 
containing the gas was calculated for each time step in accordance with the Wilkins 
algorithm. We then again determined the pressure in this volume in accordance with 
the law p
A
=
exp(
)
αc t
2 , where A = 50 MPa, c2 = 1500 m/s, and α = −3.
Let us examine the effect of hydroelastic processes on the dynamics of buckling 
(slamming) of the shell. Under the influence of the underwater wave propagating 
from the gas bubble and the hydraulic flow, the shell undergoes a deflection which 
reaches −2f. This corresponds to its nearly complete buckling. Here, we assumed 
that Eqs. (6.12) were valid up to deflections on the order of l0h. The changes in the 
deflection of the pole of the shell and the pressure in the adjacent volume of liquid 
over time are shown in Figure 6.5.

165
Interaction of Extreme Underwater Waves
The results shown in Figure 6.5 indicate that the shell is completely inverted at 
t ≈ 26.5 × 10−4 second. It then oscillates relative to this position. It should be noted 
that the shell was designed without allowance for ductility. Thus, retention of the 
inverted form of the shell can be explained only by pressure and the damping effect 
of the liquid.
The calculation also shows the substantial impact of cavitational effects on the 
dynamics of the shell. If we use the model of an ideal elastic fluid, we find that the 
shell undergoes high-frequency vibrations relative to the inverted position. These 
vibrations are accompanied by powerful pulsations of the pressure in the liquid. It 
follows from calculations performed with the above-described liquid model that the 
pressure in the rarefaction zones reaches −500 MPa, whereas that in the compres-
sion zones 1300 MPa. Thus, the model of an ideally elastic fluid leads to completely 
erroneous results while calculating the flow of the liquid. Appreciably more accurate 
data on deflections and the pressure in the liquid can be obtained by taking cavitation 
into account. This conclusion is consistent with the well-known results obtained for 
plates (see Chapters 4 and 5).
Figure 6.6 shows the process of inversion of the shell and the development of the 
cavitation zone in the adjacent liquid. Deformation of the shell begins in the central 
part and propagates outward to the contour.
It should be noted that besides the zones of very low negative pressure, calcula-
tions with the ideally elastic fluid model showed that other rarefaction regions also 
exist. The negative pressure in these regions reaches −1 MPa. However, calculations 
performed with allowance for cavitation did not reveal any other cavitation zones 
besides those noted in Figure 6.6 [39].
Thus, we can conclude the following: the liquid prevents development of the pro-
cess of nonlinear vibration of the shell after buckling; after the loss of stability, 
the dynamics of the shell depends appreciably on cavitation processes in the liquid; 
FIGURE 6.5 Change in the deflection of the pole point of the shell (the solid lines show 
results without allowance for cavitation, whereas the dashed lines show results with allow-
ance for the same).

166
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
the volume occupied by the cavitation cavity may be an order of magnitude greater 
than the volume bounded by the deformed and undeformed surfaces of the spherical 
panel; and allowance for cavitation phenomena in the liquid is a necessary condition 
for the proper dynamic design of hydroelastic systems.
6.4  TRANSIENT INTERACTION OF A STIFFENED SPHERICAL 
DOME WITH UNDERWATER SHOCK WAVES
The characteristic features of the nonstationary interaction between stiffened struc-
tures and a fluid are investigated. Nonlinear equations of the theory of shells and 
hydrodynamics, which make it possible to account for the discreteness of stiffener 
arrangement and the possibility of cavitation developing in the fluid, are used. A 
method of solving the interaction problems is proposed for the case of a shell rein-
forced with a crossing system of stiffeners [40–44].
In our study, we describe models, methods, and the results of investigation of the 
nonstationary behavior of stiffened spherical shells that cover the ends of pipes, and 
their interaction with a fluid. Numeric calculations are performed.
6.4.1  The proBleM and MeThod of SoluTion
Let us examine an absolutely rigid semi-infinite cylinder, which is submerged in water 
and bounded by a stiffened elastic spherical dome. Let us investigate the nonstation-
ary wave processes that take place in the hydroelastic system: liquid + dome + rigid 
cylinder when a plane shock wave of pressure strikes the dome (Figure 6.7a). The 
flow of the nonviscous fluid is described using equations of hydrodynamics with 
allowance for the possibility that cavitation will develop. The motion of the dome 
was investigated within the framework of the geometrically nonlinear Timoshenko-
type theories. Two forms of dome reinforcement are analyzed: with annular stiffen-
ers and a crossing system of stiffeners with allowance for the width and discreteness 
of their arrangement.
In the case of a shell reinforced by a crossing system of stiffeners, it is required 
to use three-dimensional equations of hydrodynamics to determine the hydrody-
namic load; this is associated with excessive expenditure of machine time for the 
FIGURE 6.6 Dynamics of development of cavitation zones in the liquid and the elastic 
deformation of the shell over time: (a) t = 0, (b) t = 12 × 10−4 second, (c) t = 15 × 10−4 second, 
(d) t = 18 × 10−4 second, (e) t = 20 × 10−4 second, and (f) t = 26 × 10−4 second.

numeric  calculation. The three-dimensional problem is reduced to a two-dimen-
sional one on the basis of an algorithm, which includes the following steps:
	
1. The search for a smooth shell (equivalent shell), which is close to the stiff-
ened shell in terms of character of deformation [44].
	
2. Determination of the hydrodynamic load on the dome by the combined 
solution of two-dimensional equations of hydrodynamics and one-dimen-
sional equations of the motion of the equivalent shell.
	
3. Determination of the SSS of the stiffened dome, proceeding from the 
hydrodynamic load determined in the previous step.
Motion equations of the shell. Let us examine a shallow dome reinforced from the 
inside. The lining and stiffeners are fabricated from the same material. The median 
surface of the lining can be adopted as the coordinate surface. The motion equations 
of the shell, which is reinforced by a crossing system of stiffeners, can be written in 
a Cartesian coordinate system [40–43]:

Shell models (A, B, C). Let us briefly describe the three methods used to model

consideration of the discreteness of stiffener arrangement and the third on the use of 
the method of structural orthotropy.

surface can be neglected. The discreteness of stiffener arrangement can be 
accounted for δ-functions. This model is a special case of the previous one, 
and its relationships can be obtained by limiting conversion from single 
columnar functions to δ-functions. Model B is described in greater detail in 
Ref. [42,43].
C. According to this model, the stiffened shell can be considered orthotropic. 
The stiffness of the ribs is distributed or, in other words, “spread out” over 
the length of the section between ribs. Model C has been widely used by 
Vol’mir [41].
Hydrodynamic equations. Two-dimensional equations of conservation for the fluid 
were written in the forms (6.14) and (6.15). Computed region of fluid is shown in 
Figure 6.9.
Fluid failure in rarefaction zones is studied using the simplest model, whose 
essence consists in the fact that in the case when the pressure drops below the criti-
cal value in a microvolume of fluid (Pcr = −0.2 MPa), it is assumed equal to Pcr.
The shell’s perimeter is considered as fixed. The initial time (t = 0) is the moment 
of contact of the front of the underwater wave and the surface of the shell. When 
t = 0, the parameters of the dome’s SSS are known.

The problem can be solved using the finite-difference method with an explicit 
scheme of integration over time. Wilkins’ numeric scheme was used while calcu-
lating (6.14) and (6.15) [38]. Equations. (6.17) were integrated on the basis of the 
numeric scheme [39,44].
The computed region of the fluid is shown in Figure 6.9. Its dimensions were 
selected so that the region boundaries did not affect the parameters of the processes 
under study in the time interval under consideration. To shorten the machine time

required for the calculation, we used a nonuniform grid (see the grid region in 
Figure 6.9).
The median surface was divided into circular elements when calculating smooth 
shells or shells reinforced with the annular stiffeners, and into tetragonal cells in the 
case of the crossing system of stiffeners. The grid step was reduced in zones near 
stiffeners; in this case,

The calculations were performed for the following geometric and mechanical 
dome characteristics: h = 0.01 m, R = 2 m, R0 = 0.5 m, E = 75,600 MPa, ν = 0.3, and 
ρ0 = 2640 kg/m3. The stiffeners have the same tetragonal cross section, whose height 
hs = 4 cm and width ξ = 3.33 cm. The plane pressure wave in the fluid was assigned 
in the following form:

We investigated the interaction of the underwater wave and shell by the stepwise 
complication of the dome model. The dome was treated as an undeformable body, or 
a smooth and reinforced (annular or crossing stiffeners) shell.
Smooth shell. Calculations were performed under the assumption of the 
shell’s absolute rigidity and deformability. The results of the calculation for time 
t =
×
75
10−6 second are presented in Figure 6.10.
In the case of the absolutely rigid shell, the pressure field was compared with the 
test. The equations derived by Grigolyuk and Gorshkov [45] on the basis of the ana-
lytic solution of the wave equation for a fluid were used to calculate the test data. As 
it is apparent, the computational results are in good agreement with the test results 
in the central portion of the shell where its surface is nearly flat. The significant dif-
ference between these data near the edges is explained by the fact that in this zone, 
the fluid flow is complex in nature and the analytic theory [45] does not provide for 
sufficient accuracy of pressure calculation.

171
Interaction of Extreme Underwater Waves
Calculations performed with allowance for shell deformability indicated that the 
pressure on its surface varies rather smoothly and depends heavily on the thickness 
of the shell. The results of the calculations are approximated to those obtained for an 
absolutely rigid body as h increases.
Annular stiffeners. We investigated the SSS of domes reinforced by annular 
stiffeners while accounting for their interaction with the fluid. A comparative analy-
sis of the computational results of stiffened and smooth shells of similar weight was 
performed to determine the thickness of an equivalent smooth shell. We examined 
cases of reinforcement with two, four, and nine stiffeners. The thickness of the cor-
responding smooth shell is determined from the following equation:

 The deflections at the pole of the stiffened and smooth shells for different times 
are made in Figure 6.11. As is apparent, the reinforcement exerts a significant influ-
ence on the magnitude of the deflection. The maximum deflection of the shell having 
the reinforcement is nearly half of the maximum deflection of the smooth shell if 
N = 2. At the same time the maximum deflection of the shell having the reinforce-
ment is larger than the maximum deflection of the corresponding equivalent smooth 
shell when N = 4 and N = 9.
It follows from the calculations that for the shell having the reinforcement, the 
strain state (SS) may both approach (when N = 4) the SS of a smooth shell of equal 
weight, and differ significantly from it (when N = 2 and 9), depending on the number 
of stiffeners.
Laws governing the distribution of force and bending waves along the surface dur-
ing hydropulsed immersion were established as a result of the numeric calculations.

The distribution of deflections along the radius ribbed and smooth shells of similar 
weight for different times is shown in Figure 6.12. As it is apparent, one inflection 
zone, which subsequently moves toward the center, appears in the initial load step

second. (Here and in Figure 6.13, the location of stiffener arrangement is denoted by points.)

of the smooth shell near the edge, while several inflection zones appear in the case 
of the stiffened shell, depending on the number of stiffeners and their location. The 
pole part of the ribbed shell, which is surrounded by the first annular stiffener, moves 
as a rigid body, i.e., without appreciable bends. A region of vigorous bending may 
develop, however, near the edges.
A representation of the influence exerted by annular stiffeners on the character of 
the stress distribution along the surface of a stiffened shell is given in Figure 6.13. It 
is apparent that the presence of stiffeners leads to an increase in the forces N1 and N2 
and in the moment M2; and to a decrease in the moment M1 and intersecting force Q 
as compared to the case of a smooth shell. The values of N2 and M2 vary in a jump-
wise manner at points of stiffener deployment.
The reinforcement of a shell with annular stiffeners may therefore be irrational; 
that is, the bearing capacity of a stiffened shell is lower than the bearing capacity of 
a smooth shell of the same weight.
Crossing system of stiffeners. We examined stiffeners arranged similarly with 
respect to the X and Y axes, i.e., the stiffener coordinates X j
i
= Y when i = j and 
N = M. The effect of the number of stiffeners Ns = N + M on the dome’s dynamics, 
disregarding the effect of the fluid, was investigated initially. The parameters of the 
external load were assigned in the form (6.19), where p0 = 5 MPa, α = 10−3 seconds, 
and Xs = 0. We examined the cases Ns = 4, 6, and 8. Each computational variant was 
repeated for a smooth dome with a weight equal to that of the stiffened dome using 
one-dimensional equations of shell motion.
Analysis of the results obtained indicated that for the infrequent deployment of 
stiffeners in the crossing system, the bearing capacity of the stiffened shell increases 
significantly as compared to that of the smooth shell (Figure 6.14).
It was therefore established that when Ns ≥ 6, one-dimensional equations of 
motion of a smooth shell can be used for an approximate determination of the SS 
parameters of a shell of equal weight, reinforced by a crossing system of stiffeners.

Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
Conclusions
	
1. Reinforcement of a shell with annular stiffeners does not always lead to an 
increase in bearing capacity.
2. When Ns ≥6, one-dimensional equations of motion of a smooth shell can 
be used for an approximate determination of the SS parameters of a shell 
of equal weight, reinforced with a crossing system of stiffeners; the greater 
the number of stiffeners, the better the accuracy of the solution using the 
smooth shell model.
3. An algorithm for calculating the SSS of shells, which are reinforced with a 
crossing system of stiffeners and which interact with a fluid, is developed.
	
	
6.5  EXTREME AMPLIFICATION OF WAVES AT 
VICINITY OF THE STIFFENING RIB
To increase the rigidity and stability of structures under the action of extreme waves, 
they are often supported by stiffeners made of a more durable material. Examples of 
calculations of such structures are given above. However, shell models do not always 
make it possible to evaluate the strength of a structure, especially in places where 
stresses are concentrated. This can be done more accurately using the equations of 
elasticity theory.

Interaction of Extreme Underwater Waves
Examples of such calculations are given in monographs [17–19,27]. To illustrate 
the dynamic stresses arising in the vicinity of the stiffeners, we give some calculated 
results without description of the calculation method itself.
It is assumed that the shell and the stiffener are made of different materials, 
namely, glass and steel. Calculation parameters are as follows: R = 1 м, d = 0.9 м, 
e = 0.8 м, L = 2.2 м and L1 = 1 м (Figure 6.15). Let us consider the stresses arising 
in the vicinity of the rib (stiffener) at the first moments of time, when perturbations 
from the cylinder ends have not yet reached reinforcements. The stresses are related 
to the amplitude of the underwater wave.
A long wave. With the action of a long wave, a gradual increase in the stresses 
σ rr in time is observed (Figure 6.16). At the corner point, there is a more intensive 
surge of stresses.
Stretching stresses σ xx and σ ϕϕ occur only near the ends of the cylinder. Stresses 
σ rr within the considered site do not exceed the dynamic pressure of the liquid.
A comparison is made of the last results with those obtained for entirely glass 
cylinder. The nature of the change in the stressed-deformed state of the body did not 
change qualitatively. The quantitative results differed up to two times.
Short wave. The action of a short wave is accompanied by a completely different 
picture of stress distribution. We illustrate this with an example σ rr at the most char-
acteristic moments of the interaction time (Figure 6.17). At t = 0.03 second, the com-
pression wave approaches the contact surface of the cylinder with the rib and partially 
passes into the rib. The stress σ rr at the angular point increases and at t = 0.075 second 
is 6 times greater than the maximum pressure in the underwater wave.
The wave reflects from the cylindrical surface of the rib at t = 0.1 second. As a 
result the wave of the tensile stresses forms. In the subsequent, there is a decrease in 
stress along the entire section of the rib (Figure 6.17). Wave interactions smooth of 
the wave fronts.
FIGURE 6.15 A rigidly fixed glass cylinder reinforced by a steel stiffener under the action 
of an extreme underwater wave. The wave front is parallel to the surface of the cylinder.

176
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
The remaining components of the stress tensor change more smoothly with time. 
The stress distribution for cases of long (a) and short (b) waves for the instant t = 0.15 
second is shown in Figure 6.18. The pattern of distribution σ rx and σ ϕϕ under the 
action of long and short waves is approximately the same.
On the outer surface of the cylinder, over the lateral surfaces of the rib, in the 
case of a short wave, tensile stresses σ xx occur, which are two times greater than 
the amplitude pressure in the incident wave. There can be a fracture of the material 
of the cylinder within the tension wave. The fractures are symmetrical with respect 
to the middle of the rib, and the split surface in the section ϕ = 0 has a shape close 
to the ellipse.
Conclusion. In this part of the book, we pay special attention to the destruction 
of liquid within rarefaction waves.
We found that in the wide range of variations of the pressure amplitude and the 
structural elements, the results of calculations for the models of cavitation and bub-
bly liquids are much more in line with each other than with results obtained using 
the ideal elastic liquid. With regard to the applicability and accuracy of the models

Interaction of Extreme Underwater Waves
of destructible (cavitating) and bubbly liquids, it is difficult to say something as cer-
tain. Note that the programming and calculation of problems based on the bubbly 
liquid model takes much longer than the other model. In addition, let the growth time 
of the bubbles before their merging and the complete destruction of the liquid in a 
certain volume is very small and much shorter than the time of deformation of the 
structure. In this case apparently this growth of the bubbles has little effect on the 
deformation and more reasonably uses the instantaneously destructible (cavitation) 
model of liquid. Moreover, we note that the used model of bubbly liquid also has its 
drawbacks, since it does not take into account the mutual influence of the bubbles. 
Apparently, the faster the destruction of the liquid, the more applicable the cavita-
tion liquid model. The last conclusion agrees with the conclusion made in the theory 
of dynamic destruction of solids about the applicability of the instantaneous split 
criterion (see Section 2.1).

Counterintuitive Behavior 
of Structural Elements 
after Impact Loads
Everything should be as simple as possible,
but not simpler.
Albert Einstein
It is known that the solids can demonstrate different kinds of nonlinearity in  different 
situations. In some cases, it is elastic nonlinearity. In other cases, n onlinearity 
 manifests itself in the form of plasticity [1–7]. Often the nonlinear elastic– plastic 
properties can manifest themselves together (see Sections 1.2, 4.4.4, and 6.1). 
In  particular, during the impulse load, the thin-walled constructions can lead 
 self-some as a plastic body, but after removing the load, it turns out that the body con-
serves enough elastic forces which can manifest itself. As a result, the  structure does 
not always receive the expected form. This is so-called c ounterintuitive  behavior 
(CIB). CIB means an appearance of final deflections of these elements which are 
contrary to the direction of the impulsive loading. The CIB effect can be accompa-
nied by a failure of structural elements.
Here the material published in [8–10] is presented.

7 Experimental Data
7.1  INTRODUCTION AND METHOD OF IMPACT LOADING
CIB of circular plates was discovered during studies of action of underwater [11,12] 
and air [3] explosion on the plates. In [11, pp. 377–378], plates of different thick-
nesses of iron, copper, and lead were examined. The plates covered a round hole in 
the wall of a thick-walled cistern filled by water. Explosions of different power were 
carried out within the cistern. The plates usually showed a final deflection directed 
outside of the cistern. After each explosion, the deformed plate was replaced by a 
new one.
However in one series of the experiments, the following paradoxical result was 
found. The final deflection of the plates, which was normally directed outside of 
the cistern, increased to a definite value together with a rise of the explosion power. 
When the explosion power was increased still further through, the direction of the 
final deflection was changed so that it pointed toward the inside of the cistern. It was 
noted [11] that this CIB was not fully understood and no theory was put forward to 
explain it.
CIB sometimes occurred as a result of loading of metal plates by an electrical 
discharge in water [12]. The circular plates of aluminum alloy AMΓ and ductile steel 
(steel 3) were used. Sometimes, a layer of rubber was placed on the metal plate. In 
some cases, a layer of air was left between the rubber and the metal. The thickness, 
h, of the metal plates varied from 1 to 3 mm, and the radius, R, varied from 150 to 
500 mm. The electrical discharge took place at a distance from 100 to 200 mm away 
from the plates. In [12], figures of plates after CIB occurred were given. The center 
part of the plates was deflected contrary to the direction of the underwater electrical 
discharge loading. There were no theoretical explanations for these figures.
Thin circular metal plates (h/R ≈ 0.01) of aluminum alloy AMΓ-6 sometimes 
exhibited CIB after blast loading if a plastic deformation was small [13, p. 162]. This 
behavior was explained in [13] in the following manner. The plate bends after load-
ing and oscillates as the shallow shell. In the case of CIB, vibration energy of this 
shell is enough for only one reverse snap-buckling.
Some figures illustrating the possible occurrence of CIB of the plates after loading 
by the underwater explosion were presented in the theoretical investigations [14,15].
Ross et al. [16] described tests of aluminum plates and beams subjected to blast 
loading and showed the final shape of one beam specimen as having a counterintui-
tive deflection. Moessner [17] carried out tests on clamped steel beams, using explo-
sive pressure, and found one case of the counterintuitive deflection about 1 mm in a 
specimen of length 200 mm.
The first theoretical investigations into CIB of elastic–plastic structures were pub-
lished in 1985 [14,18,19]. Moreover, two directions of investigation appeared simul-
taneously. The first direction [18,20–25] considers different models of a relatively 

184
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
simple structural element (i.e., a beam), subjected to a uniformly distributed rect-
angular pressure pulse. The dynamics of those models was studied very thoroughly 
using currently available mathematical methods. The second direction considers cir-
cular plates and shallow shells subjected to a uniformly distributed rectangular pres-
sure pulse, and an air or underwater explosion using more traditional (i.e., numerical) 
methods of study [14,19,26–33].
It was shown that the pulse deforms the beam into a shallow elastic–plastic arch. 
This arch can sometimes lose its stability by snap-buckling under the action of 
unloading forces. This behavior occurred within some narrow ranges of structure 
and loading parameters during a transition from elastic to moderately small plastic 
deformations. Particularly in the realm of CIB, the character of the beam response 
depends strongly on initial conditions, and very small perturbations of them can 
change the magnitude and the sign of the residual plastic deflection. These phe-
nomena are associated with chaotic vibrations [20–25]. The above theoretical inves-
tigations opened the way for purposive experiments [34,35], which confirmed the 
theoretical results.
Generally speaking, the results for the circular plates and shallow shells subjected 
to uniformly distributed rectangular pressure pulse [28,29,32] agree with results 
obtained for the beam. In particular, these structural elements exhibit a behavior in 
certain ranges of their initial parameters and pulse loads which cannot be predicted. 
Within these ranges, nonlinear equations of motion for the above elements are so 
sensitive to perturbations of problem parameters that it is impossible to predict the 
dynamic behavior of real structural elements by solving the equations, since the 
initial parameters and loads are always known approximately and any correction of 
them can change calculation results significantly. In flat plate, CIB due to reverse 
snap-buckling occurs only with elastic–plastic deformation, whereas for a shallow 
spherical cap or cylindrical panel, it can occur with viscoelastic [15,29], elastic, and 
elastic–plastic [28,30] material behavior.
The above theoretical results were obtained for the rectangular or exponential 
pressure pulse. These approximations of actual load shape simplify a theoretical 
analysis and are usually an acceptable idealization for many practical problems. 
At the same time, the final displacements of the plates can depend significantly upon 
the pulse shape [36]. The pulse shape especially is important for the phenomenon of 
CIB, which is very sensitive to the changes of the parameters of loading.
CIB of some structural elements loaded by a blast was studied in [37], where the 
influence on this behavior of a depression wave moving after a compression shock 
wave was emphasized. The structure deforms into a new shape during loading by the 
compression shock wave. This shape may lose its stability as a result of unloading of 
the structural material and of the action of the depression wave. In case of an under-
water explosion, the load strongly depends on the structure/liquid interaction and 
the appearance of cavitation in the liquid. These phenomena as well as unloading of 
the material and a static pressure in order to study CIB of structures in contact with 
liquid must be taken into account [26,31,23].
On the whole, the most publications considered are concerned with the results 
of theoretical investigations. There are only a few publications devoted to results of 
experiments, which are limited to cases of beams and circular plates.

185
Experimental Data
Method. Here data of experiments carried out in Russia from 1972 till 1985 are 
presented. The main purpose of the experiments was to study the strength of thin-
walled constructions under the action of an air explosion. Every test was repeated 
three or more times. Phenomenon of CIB occasionally occurred during the experi-
ments with different single- and double-layer plates, and circular single- and double-
layer membranes made from a wire net, and shallow spherical shells (caps). The 
possibility of a failure of the double-layer plates and cups after reverse snap- buckling 
under the action of unloading forces was also discovered. The masses of trotyl 
charges, distances L (Figure 7.1) from charges to center of the tested structural ele-
ments, and amplitudes of loads had been defined under which CIB of the specimens 
occurred. The experimental results will be discussed below using various models 
and results of aerodynamics and structural dynamics.
First, we describe a method of loading and a profile of the pressure acting on the 
specimens. The load was created by an explosion of a spherical trotyl charge in the 
atmosphere. It is known [38] that after an air explosion of moderate power, a discon-
tinuous increase in pressure occurs at a distance equal to 10–11 radii of the spherical 
charge. The compression pressure behind the discontinuous jump is much more than 
the atmospheric pressure p0. The spherical compression shock wave diverges, and 
the discontinuous increase in pressure becomes weaker. The shock wave changes its 
shape in time. Particularly, a depression wave arises traveling behind the compres-
sion shock wave [39]. At first, the depression wave has a modulus of an amplitude 
much smaller than the modulus of an amplitude of the compression shock wave. 
Therefore in case of the action of such spherical blast on a structure, the influence 
of the depression wave on its response is very small. However, in the next moment

Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
of time the amplitude of the compression shock wave reduces and the effect of the 
depression wave on the structure response may be important.
We assume [39] that the depression wave must be taken into account if a relation 
of the amplitude p2, of the compression shock wave, to the pressure p1 before the 
discontinuous jump, is less than (γ + 1)/(γ − 1), where γ is the adiabatic coefficient 
of the gas. For atmospheric air, γ = 1.4 and p

, so the influence of the depres-
sion wave will be important if the amplitude of the compression wave acting on the 
specimen is less than 0.6 MPa. Therefore, we will take into account the depression 
wave only if
	
0.6MPa.

In the experiments, the trotyl mass q was varied from 0.05 to 1 kg. Assuming that 
the density of trotyl is 1.65 g/cm3, we can find the resulting distances at which the 
discontinuous jump arises. For the above variation of q, these distances change from 
25 to 70 cm. In the experiments, the distance L (Figure 7.1) was approximately two 
times larger than the distance of the discontinuous jump arose. The amplitude p2 of 
the compression shock wave pressure acting on the specimen as a result of the above 
charge explosion varied from 0.04 to 1 MPa.
After the explosion, the pressure on the specimen underwent a discontinuous 
jump up to the largest value P
p
>
2 (see Eq. (7.3)), then decreased below atmospheric 
(negative pressure wave on Figure 7.1), and finally returned to its initial value. As 
a result, the total pressure (dynamic pressure plus atmospheric pressure) on the 
deformed structural element could change direction during loading.
Different structural elements were examined [13] on the action of the blast load-
ing, but CIB demonstrated only initially flat plates and membranes, and shallow 
caps. The plates were either circular or rectangular.
The dynamic displacements were measured by electromagnetic sensors. They 
allowed us to measure a displacement amplitude of up to 6 mm. Larger displace-
ments were measured with the help of a light sensor which recorded the change of a 
beam of light reflected by the test specimen. The jump pressure was obtained using 
piezoelectric transducer. A description of the electrical and optical schemes of the 
above sensors can be found in [13, pp. 147–148].
Typical oscillograms of counterintuitive displacement of the center of specimens 
are given in Figure 7.2.
At first, the displacement directs from the charge. Then, as a result of reverse 
snap-buckling, the specimen moves contrary to the direction of the blast loading and 
begins to oscillate near a new equilibrium position. The amplitude of these oscilla-
tions reduces and an average displacement increases a little in course of time. One 
can see that CIB occurred if the rate of deforming under the shock wave loading was 
approximately four times less than the period of free oscillations of the specimens. 
It is interesting to note that an amplitude of the free oscillations may be compa-
rable with the maximum displacement of the specimen during blast loading. So, the 
specimen can have considerable elastic energy after reverse snap-buckling to the 
new equilibrium position. Later, this energy dissipates due to cyclic plastic deforma-
tions connected with the concentric bending waves traveling from the edge to the

center of the specimen and back again. The final displacement of the specimen may 
be  comparable to the maximum displacement during loading by the compression 
shock wave.
7.2  CIB OF CIRCULAR PLATES: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
These plates sometimes exhibited CIB after blast loading if a plastic deformation 
was small. This behavior was explained in [13] in the following manner. The plate 
bends after loading and oscillates as a shallow shell. In the case of CIB, vibration 
energy of this shell is enough for only one reverse snap-buckling. Two specimens 
after test are presented in Figure 7.3.
Single-layer and double-layer circular plates were tested. Below some mechanical 
and geometrical parameters of specimens which demonstrated CIB are given, and 
some elements of the experimental equipment are described.
FIGURE 7.2 Three typical oscillograms showing counterintuitive displacement at the 
 center of specimens.
FIGURE 7.3 Typical forms of plates after reverse snap-buckling. The radius R of the 
clamped specimens was 90 mm; the thickness h varied from 0.4 to 5 mm. The thin specimens 
(h/R = 0.01) showed a variety of behavior under loading. Sometimes, bending waves were 
observed. They usually focused on the center of the specimens.

188
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
Single-layer circular plates and caps were produced from an aluminum– magnesium 
alloy AMΓ-6 (density ρ = 2700 kg/m3, Young’s modulus E = 70,000 MPa, Poisson’s 
ratio ν = 0.3, yield stress σ0 = 190 MPa, strain-hardening exponent E1 = 3500 MPa) 
together with thick edges (circular stiffening frame). These edges had holes. The 
holes were used in order to bolt the thick edges of the specimens to the motionless 
equipment (see Figure 7.3 and 7.4). The thickness of the above specimens varied 
from 0.5 to 4 mm.
The double-layer circular plates were produced by gluing to the metal plates a 
layer of an elastic material (polymethylmethacrylate: ρ = 1200 kg/m3; E = 5350 MPa; 
ν = 0.35). The thickness h1 of the elastic layer was varied from 2 to 6 mm. The 
 double-layer plates were fronted toward the trotyl charge by the elastic layer.
The circular round-meshed plates were also tested. The perforated circular holes 
formed a square mesh on the plate surface. Figure 7.4 shows the round-meshed plate 
after its failure by an underwater explosion. The locations of the holes and the circu-
lar stiffening frame are visible. The minimum distance between the hole centers was 
10 mm, which was the same for all the plates. The diameter, d, of the holes (perfora-
tions) was constant for each plate but varied from 2 to 7 mm for the different plates.
Results. Some data of the tests for which CIB of the circular plane specimens 
occurred are presented in Table 7.1.
In Table 7.1, the data of each line correspond to an individual test. N is the num-
ber of the test, t1 is the time of loading of the plate by the compression shock wave, 
and other notations of Table 7.1 were defined above. Number 1 corresponds to the

The shallow shells formed by the explosion from the circular plates usually had 
the shape of a cupola or a cone with a spherical center section. However, sometimes 
axisymmetric shells having more complex profiles were formed. One of the above 
profiles corresponding to test 1 of Table 7.1 is shown in Figure 7.5. The profile is

The shape of the profile is apparently a result of the oscillations of the plate, with a 
large amplitude, after the reverse snap-buckling (see Figure 7.2). The reverse snap-
buckling of the double-layer plate having large perforations (test 4 of Table 7.1) was 
accompanied by the failure of polymethylmethacrylate. The amplitude and shape of 
oscillations of this plate changed instantly, after the above failure (see the oscillo-
gram in Figure 7.6 and compare this oscillogram with that in Figure 7.2). The failure 
of the elastic layer occurred in the center and near the edge of the plate.

In our tests, p1 = p0. This formula is for a reflection of a shock wave on a rigid wall. 
The plates can be considered motionless at the first moment of the reflection. We did 
not take into account the influence of the permeability of the plate. A comparison of 
tests 4 and 5 shows that the influence of the permeability on P was small. Knowing 
p2 will allow us to discuss the influence of the depression wave on the behavior of 
the tested plates.
Discussion. 1. First, we shall consider test 1. In order to simplify the analysis, 
we start with the assumption that the stress state existing before the reverse snap-
buckling of the tested plate was similar to a stress state of the same plate under the 
static uniform load. The influence of membrane forces and plastic deformations are 
also ignored. We take into account that the experimental boundary conditions do not 
correspond perfectly to the conditions of a fully clamped plate. For the analysis of 
the stress state of the tested plate, we used the curves in Figure 7.7 [41].
According to Figure 7.7, plastic deformations can first appear either in the center 
or near the edge of the plate. Consequently, if these plastic deformations are moder-
ately small, then the main volume of the plate material undergoes only elastic defor-
mation and thus accumulates elastic energy. At the moment t = t1, when the action 
of the compression shock wave is ending, the plate can begin its reverse motion and 
start subsequent oscillations. If plastic deformation occurs during the reverse motion 
of the plate, then we can have the phenomenon of CIB (see Figure 7.2). If the plastic 
deformations of the reverse motion and subsequent oscillations are very small, then 
the oscillations can become chaotic [22–24].
Apparently, the occurrence of CIB discussed above is possible only if the time 
of loading, by the positive pressure, is less than the period T of the fundamental 
frequency of the plate oscillations. We found T assuming that the plate was fully 
clamped [42]: T = 0.0032 s−1. So the time of loading of the plate by the compression 
shock wave was a little less than T/4 (t1 = 0.0006 s).
The depression wave acted on the plate after the compression shock wave. 
An amplitude of the depression wave A cannot be large since |A| < p0. However, the 
FIGURE 7.7 The profiles of radial Mr and tangential Mθ moments of a circular plate: (a) fully 
clamped edge and (b) simply supported edge.

191
Experimental Data
influence of the depression wave on the result of test 1 was important because the 
amplitude of the compression wave (p2 = 0.41 MPa) for this test was not large; thus, 
the condition (7.1) fulfills. The effect of the depression wave increases because the 
time and direction of its action coincides with the time and direction of the reverse 
snap-buckling of the plate.
Figure 7.8 shows schemes of loading and motion of two points on the plate, which 
are summarized above. One can see that CIB of the plate is explained by the simulta-
neous appearances of unloading of the material of the plate and the negative pressure 
on the plate. Of course, the occurrence of CIB is possible only if the essential mate-
rial of the plate deforms elastically before its reverse snap-buckling.
Discussion. 2. Now, we consider the perforated plates (tests 2–4). The perforation 
resulted in the permeability of the plates. We could change the permeability of the 
plate by the variation of, d, in order to vary a plate/blast wave interaction. The table 
shows that the perforated plates were subjected to more intensive and longer duration 
blast loading than the plate of test 1.
Because of the increase of p2, we can ignore the influence of the depression wave 
acting on the perforated plates (see Eq. (7.1)). For tests 2–4, aerodynamic processes 
(connected with transition of the discontinuous jump of pressure and transient air 
flow through the permeable plate) were of primary importance. In the first moments 
of loading, the air flows into the box (Figure 7.9(a)). As a result, the pressure in the 
box becomes larger than atmospheric pressure outside the box. When the loading

cular plate. P is the curve of the pressure variation. 1; 2 and 1’; 2’ are the curves for the 
elastic–plastic and elastic plates, respectively. 1 is the displacement of the plate point where 
the material obtained plastic strains. 1’ is the same for the elastic plate. 2 is the displacement 
of the plate point where the material has not obtained plastic strains. 2’ is the same for the

of the plate by the compression shock wave ends, the plate begins reverse motion 
under: the action of unloading of its material, the pressure inside the box, and the air 
counterflow (Figure 7.9(b)).
Apparently, CIB of the plates for tests 2; 3; 4 are associated both with unloading 
of the plate material and the transient aerodynamical processes of the air wave flow 
through the permeable surface of the plates.
Discussion. 3. Now, we shall consider test 5. Reasons for CIB of the thick 
((h + h1)/R = 0.077) two-layer plate used in test 5 may only be due to the mechanical 
properties of the plate. The thicker layer of the plate was elastic (polymethylmethac-
rylate), and the other was elastic–plastic (metal). During the blast loading, the elas-
tic layer accumulated elastic strain energy. In the next moments during unloading, 
reverse snap-buckling, and the following oscillations of the plate, this energy was 
absorbed by the elastic–plastic deformed metal layer. As a result the double-layer 
plate fixed, the final displacement directed to the charge.
Remark 1. The example of the plate for test 5 (Table 7.1) shows that the structures 
(systems) containing both elastic and elastic–plastic elements can apparently dem-
onstrate the anomalous response on an impulse load. In particular, they can demon-
strate CIB in cases when large plastic deformations occur if the energy accumulated 
by the elastic elements is much larger than the other elastic–plastic elements of the 
structure (system), which are able to absorb elastically. Therefore, the energy of the 
elastic elements can be dissipated by the large plastic deformations of the elastic–
plastic elements.

tion of the pressure and air flow at the first moments of the action of the compression shock 
wave on the plate; and (b) the direction of the pressure and air counterflow during of the 
action of the depression wave on the plate.

193
Experimental Data
Remark 2. Test 1 (Figure 7.5) and the peculiarities of the failure of the plate of 
test 4 show that the most intensive bending stresses existed in the center and near 
the edge of the plate. Therefore, the stress state of the tested plates was closer to the 
stress state of the fully clamped plate (Figure 7.7(a)) than to the simply supported 
plate (Figure 7.6(b)). Figure 7.5 shows that the amplitude of the concentric bending 
wave of the displacement was near the center of the plate much more than the ampli-
tude of this wave near the edge. Apparently, the experimental boundary conditions 
for the tested plates can be simulated by the conditions of the fully clamped edge 
more accurately than the simple support conditions.
Remark 3. The maximum displacement of the double-layer plate (test 4 of the 
table) after the reverse snap-buckling was more than its maximum displacement dur-
ing loading by the compression shock wave (Figure 7.6). This is apparently due to the 
focusing of bending waves traveling from the edge to the center of the plate and with 
the action of the box pressure and the air counterflow.
Remark 4. Test 4 of Table 7.1 (Figure 7.6) shows that the failure is accompanied 
by the simultaneous dissipation of the total energy and ending of the large oscilla-
tions of the specimen center.
7.3 C IB OF RECTANGULAR PLATES AND SHALLOW CAPS
Rectangular plates. Plates made from alloy AMΓ-6 were tested. Their thickness h 
ranged from 1 to 4 mm. The length of the larger edge of the plate was 250 or 300 mm; 
the length of the other edge changed from 60 to 250 mm. Plates were examined 
with fully clamped edges or combined boundary conditions (i.e., fully clamped short 
edges and free long edges). Different shapes of explosion loading were used. About 
150 fully clamped plates were tested [13].
In the case of the combined boundary conditions, 45 plates were tested [13]. The 
time of the blast loading was less than T/4 (T is the fundamental period of elastic 
oscillations of the plate). The test results agreed with the data of the tests of the other 
researchers [43,44]. The final displacements of these plates were less than 10h, and 
the plastic deformations were not large. The experimental results [13, pp. 153–156] 
did not therefore coincide with those of the calculations according to the theory [45].
CIB of the rectangular plate occurred after an explosion of 0.18 kg trotyl at a 
distance of 0.65 m from the fully clamped plate. The sides of the plate were 150 and 
300 mm, and the thickness was 4 mm. The maximum final displacement of this plate 
obtained as a result of reverse snap-buckling was 5.41 mm.
Discussion. According to [39] (see also Table 7.1 and Eq. (7.1)), an explosion of 
0.18 kg trotyl did not form an appreciable depression wave at a distance of 0.65 m. 
Therefore, CIB of the rectangular plate was only associated with unloading of its 
material.
Spherical shallow shells. The shallow caps used in the test were made from 
alloy AMΓ-6. The radius R of the cap’s edge varied from 30 to 150 mm, the thick-
ness h from 0.3 to 5 mm, and the rise height H from 2 to 40 mm. The geometry of 
the caps was defined by the dimensionless ratio K
R
=
/ ah where a is the radius of 
the initial cap curvature. Various methods for causing the impulse load were used. 
Under explosive loading, the caps demonstrated either a dynamic axisymmetric 

194
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
snap-buckling if K ≤ 6.3, or a dynamic non-axisymmetric snap-buckling if K > 6.3 
[13, pp. 168–169]. The cap behavior was similar to flat plate behavior when K < 3. 
The results of many tests are presented in [13].
The numerical investigations showed the possibility of CIB of shallow spherical 
caps subjected to an impact loading on the concave side [15,28,32]. The analogous 
result was found experimentally for the caps loaded by a blast.
The dimensions of the caps were as follows: h = 0.55 mm, H = 7.5 mm, R = 90 mm, 
and a = 535 mm. Therefore, K = 1.65 and k = 0.042. The trotyl mass was 0.053 kg. 
Loading was realized by an explosion at a distance of 0.8 m (when P = 3 MPa) or 
1.15 m (when P = 2.2 MPa) from the cap. At first, after shock loading, the caps lost 
stability and deformed in the direction of the blast; but then reverse snap-buckling 
of the caps occurred. The caps turned out completely and after CIB formed a cone 
shape (Figure 7.10). When L = 0.8 m, the metal became thinner up to failure around 
the specimen pole. The hole caused by the failure was star-shaped. So through CIB, 
the caps can lose their strength completely.
7.3.1  diScuSSion of ciB of ShalloW capS
1. Reasons for CIB of the caps. The caps were very shallow, and their k did 
not differ strongly from (7.2). The trotyl mass q and the distances L did not 
also differ significantly from test 1 in the table. The amplitude p2 of the 
compression shock wave which acted on the caps was 0.78 MPa, when 
L = 0.8 m and 0.44 MPa when L = 1.15 m (p2 was calculated using (7.3)). 
The time of the positive pressure loading was approximately 0.7 ms. Then, 
the caps were subjected to the depression wave loading. The influence of 
the depression wave was important for the case p2 = 0.44 Mpa (see Eq. (7.1)) 
and was not very significant for p2 = 0.78 MPa. The fundamental frequency 
of the cap did not differ noticeably from the fundamental frequency of the 
flat plate for test 1 in the table. The increase in the fundamental frequency 
caused by the cap curvature was suppressed by the reduction in the cap 
thickness.

snap-buckling and (b) the type of failure of the cap near its pole.

195
Experimental Data
The parameters of the caps and loading were similar to the parameters 
in the test of the above plate. The reasons noted above allow us to think that 
CIB of the caps was associated with the simultaneous action of the material 
unloading and the depression wave.
2. Reasons for the failure of the cap pole. Now, we consider the reasons for 
the failure of the metal in the cap pole after the explosion at a distance 0.8 m 
from the cap.
2.1. Linear elastic analysis. The influence of the curvature on the stress 
state of the cap is very important. We shall evaluate this influence using 
the data of paper [46] (these data can also be found in [47, pp. 124–125]) 
where a cap with h = 0.057R was studied. The linear equations of the 
cap motion were solved, and the data from these calculations were pre-
sented in [46] with the help of dimensionless values. In particular, the 
stresses and pressure were divided into E/(1 − ν2). Some stresses for 
the fully clamped caps are given in Figure 7.11. The calculations were 
produced for various values of relation k = H/2R. One can see that for 
the small value k, the bending stresses are more important than the 
membrane stresses. Particularly, if k = 0 (flat plate), the bending stresses 
reach a maximum and the membrane stresses equal zero. When the 
value of k increases, the bending stresses reduce rapidly and the mem-
brane stresses first increase (if k ≤ 0.03) and then reduce (if k > 0.03).
Figure 7.11 shows that some particulars of the dynamic stress state 
of the cap can be similar to its static stress state. It agrees with the

assumption used for the analysis of the circular plate tests. However, 
the dynamic load is more stressful for the structural element than the 
static load. The stress state depends very strongly on the curvature of 
the cap. It is interesting to note that the tested caps had a rise height 
unfavorable for their strength (k = 0.042). The tested caps had simulta-
neously both high membrane stresses and high bending stresses in the 
pole. The stress state near the edge of the tested caps was also complex, 
but the membrane stresses were less than that in the pole. It is known 
that the membrane stresses are often more dangerous than the bending 
stresses because they are uniformly distributed through the thickness 
of a wall. If the maximum membrane stress is σ0, then the structure 
may fail, while a maximum bending stress equal to σ0 does not cause 
failure.
Thus, linear analysis has demonstrated the simultaneous existence 
in the pole of the tested caps of unfavorable membrane and bending 
stresses.
2.2. Nonlinear elastic analysis. The influence on the cap’s behavior of 
geometric nonlinearity is more than its influence on the plates’ behav-
ior. The snap-buckling of the shells is always a dynamic process even 
for static loading. These peculiarities are very interesting for the 
 problem of CIB of structural elements.
We give below the results illustrating the importance of the above 
features. The calculations of the shallow cap subjected to uniformly dis-
tributed quasi-static load presented in [13, p. 61] are used (Figure 7.12). 
The cap from alloy AMΓ-6 with parameters – a = 400 mm, R = 55 mm, 
H = 3.8 mm, h = 1 mm – was fully clamped on the edge.
The numerical solution of the nonlinear equation of motion showed 
that in the first instance, the deflection of the cap pole increased pro-
portionally to the load (section AB of Figure 7.12), next the snap- 
buckling of the cap, and the transient process of cap oscillations in the 
new equilibrium state (section BC) took place. When the load began 
to reduce, the deflection also began to reduce (section CD) and reverse 
snap- buckling (section DE) occurred. It is interesting and important 
for the cap strength that the pole transient oscillations after reverse 
snap-buckling were much larger than the oscillations after snap- 
buckling. The reasons for the pole oscillations are considered below.
Remark 5. Snap-buckling is a strong nonlinear and rapid process 
(Figure 7.12). As a result of snap-buckling, the cap can obtain a large 
elastic deflection. In particular, the snap-bucklings, following one 
after another, generate (in the fully clamped cap) intensive bending 
stresses waves. The amplitude of these waves is more than that of bend-
ing stresses wave caused by the deformation and then reverse snap- 
buckling of the fully clamped plates. Thus, in the caps, bending stresses 
were generating, as a result of CIB, more dangerous for the strength 
than bending stresses generated by CIB of the plate under similar load-
ing. It corrects the results of the linear analysis (Figure 7.11).

2.3. Nonlinear elastic–plastic analysis. The data in Figures 7.11 and 
7.12 were calculated for the elastic cap. However, the tested caps had 
plastic deformations. Figure 7.10 shows that near the pole, the cap 
deformed to a conical shape. So there are no small plastic deforma-
tions. Finite dynamic displacements of the elastic–plastic caps were 
studied in [48, pp. 122–123]. Below are some results from [48] for the 
case h/a = 0.02.
In Figure 7.13, the dimensionless displacement in the pole of the 
fully clamped semispherical cap subjected to a dynamic uniformly 
distributed step pressure is presented. W0 in Figure 6.13 is the maxi-
mum displacement of a complete spherical shell subjected to the same 
step pressure. The displacement in the pole changes and increases very 
quickly and has an alternating character. Consequently in the pole, 
the transient alternative oscillations of the bending stresses also exist. 
These stresses are very dangerous for the strength of the cap mate-
rial. The oscillations of the pole are excited by the concentric bending 
waves traveling from the edge. The waves focus on the pole and largely 
increase the stresses there. Figure 7.14 shows the profiles of the cap 
displacement. In [48], it is emphasized that the above noted transient 
alternative bending stresses increase for the shallow caps. Really, the

amplitude of the bending stresses increases as the rise height reduces 
(see Figure 7.11).
	
2.4. Reasons for the failure. The above analysis allows us to connect the 
tested cap failure with both the appearance of the plastic membrane 
strain near the pole during loading of the cap by the compression 
shock wave and the high-frequency oscillating alternating intensive 
bending stresses. The maximum membrane stresses were approxi-
mately equal to the maximum bending stresses. The concentric

displacement.

peaks 1–8 of Figure 12.

Experimental Data
bending waves generated near the edge of the cap and focused on the 
pole are a result of the snap-buckling and reverse snap-buckling of the 
cap which followed one after another. The bending stresses caused an 
increase in plastic deformation and fatigue failure of the metal in the 
pole. Amplitudes of the bending and membrane stresses were consid-
erably higher in the pole than those near the edge, and therefore, the 
failure occurred at the cap pole.
There are four stages in the deformation for the pole of the cap shown in Figure 7.15. 
They are as follows:
	
1. The displacement and snap-buckling of the cap under the action of the 
 compression shock wave (section OB).
	
2. The deformation of the cap under the action of the compression shock 
wave and the appearance in the plate pole of plastic strains connected with 
 membrane forces (section BC).

 (interrupted line), in the case of large displacement of the pole and the failure of the metal

(points).

3. The reverse snap-buckling of the cap under the action of unloading of the 
cap material and the depression wave (section CD).
4. Intensive high-frequency oscillations of the cap pole which can be accom-
panied by the rise of plastic strains because of bending stresses, metal 
fatigue and the failure (section DE, the case of the explosion in the distance 
L = 0.8 m) or damped oscillations (section DE’, the case of the explosion in 
the distance L = 1.15 m).
	
Remark 6. It is necessary to note that the oscillogram of the pole displacement (it is 
not presented here) showed that the failure of the cap took place after CIB.
Remark 7. Of course, our consideration is only qualitative because the curves of 
Figures 10–13 were calculated for loads and caps different from those of the tests.
7.3.2  cap/perMeaBle MeMBrane SySTeM
We have considered (above) CIB of the mechanical system consisting of a box closed 
by a perforated plate. CIB of this system was connected with the aerodynamic pro-
cesses of the transient air flow through the perforated plate. The system consisting of 
a cap closed by a permeable membrane was also tested. The permeable membranes 
were used as a protective screen which reduced the effect of blast loading on the 
concave side of the cap (Figure 7.16).
We will not discuss in detail the experiments with the cap. They are considered 
more carefully in [10] using the results presented in [49–57].
Results. Single- and double-layer permeable metal circular membranes 
(R = 90 mm) were used. They were made of steel wire net (steel alloy 12X18H10T:

ρ = 7800 kg/cm3, E = 200000 MPa, ν = 0.3, σ0 = 260 MPa, E1 = 1130 MPa) having 
square cells. The area of each square cell of the net was 0.004 cm2. The thickness 
of the wire was 0.5 mm. The double-layer membranes were made by positioning 
two wire nets side by side. The wires of the different layers formed an angle of 45°. 
The radius of the cap was 90 mm, the rise height varied from 5 to 40 mm, and the 
thickness was 0.5 or 1 mm. The edges of the membrane and cap were bolted on to 
the motionless support of the experimental equipment with the help of a grip ring 
(see Figures 7.1 and 7.10).
First, the caps were tested without the protective permeable membrane. Explosions 
of different power were carried out at a distance of 1 m from the cap (Figure 7.16). 
After the explosion of 0.8 kg trotyl, the amplitude of the pressure measured on the 
concave side of the cap was 4.6 MPa (p2 = 0.95 MPa, see the above table). The cap 
failed owing to tearing of the cap material at the supports. Next, the same caps with 
a protective membrane were tested. The protected caps remained intact. Behind the 
membrane, on the cap surface, the amplitude P of the blast load was 2.3 MPa.
It was discovered that CIB of membranes from the wire net was possible. The 
deflection of the single-layer membrane was smaller than the deflection of the 
 double-layer membrane for the same blast load. The final deflection of the double-
layer membrane after CIB was large and reached a value of 0.6 R. It was surprising 
that CIB was exhibited only in the external layer of the double-layer membrane, 
whereas the internal layer did not show a noticeable plastic deflection.
Figure 7.17 shows the final shape of the double-layer membrane after an explosion 
of 0.8 kg trotyl at a distance of 1 m from the cap/permeable membrane system. The 
center the membrane obtained a parabola shape as a result of CIB. The displacement 
near the edge is much less than that in the center of the membrane.
Discussion. First, we consider the process of blast loading of the concave sur-
face of the cap. The influence of the membrane and failure of the cap are not taken 
into account. In this case, a part of the blast wave (its amplitude is 0.95 MPa) loads 
and reflects from the specimen (Figure 7.16). The amplitude of the reflected shock 
wave is 4.6 MPa. Its curvature approximately equals to that of the cap. The spherical 
FIGURE 7.17 Final shape of a double-layer membrane after CIB.

202
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
reflected wave converges to point O1 shown in Figure 7.16. The other part of the 
blast wave passes by the experimental equipment. As a result, the pressure near the 
support reduces very rapidly and the spherical rarefaction waves begin to propagate 
from the support. These waves expand to the cap pole (Figure 7.16) and reduce the 
pressure acting on the cap.
Thus, after the blast loading, a complex wave process occurs when the new 
shock and the rarefaction waves appear near the cap. Generally speaking, the math-
ematical investigation of this process needs the solution of the three- dimensional 
aerodynamic equations. However, for qualitative analysis, we will consider points 
of the cap edge as sources of radial spherical waves converging to the center 
(Figure 7.16). The amplitude of each pressure wave propagating from the edge point 
reduced as r −1 (see Chapter 9). Thus, the single spherical wave propagating from 
the cap edge (Figure 7.16) damps rapidly, just as the pressure in the pole of the cap 
instantly increases rapidly due the focus of fronts of converging spherical wave 33 
(Figure 7.16).
In case of the cap preserved by the membrane, the above considerations became 
complicated by the reflected wave from the membrane and the oscillations of air 
between the cap and membrane. However, the influence of the last details is not 
significant. The distance between the membrane and cap near the support is small; 
therefore, the pressure in front of and behind the membrane becomes equal, and 
the membrane does not obtain a large displacement at the first moments of loading. 
Then, the rarefaction waves, propagating from the support to the center, unload the 
edges of the cap and membrane.
The large deflection of the membrane center (Figure 7.17) is because of loading 
by the reflected converging spherical shock wave 33 (Figure 7.16). The initial ampli-
tude of this wave is 2.3 MPa. The amplitude has increased proportional to r−1 at the 
moment of its collision with membrane, which is, as a result, equal to 5.2 MPa for 
H = 40 mm. The rarefaction waves from the support did not influence the pressure 
near the center because the time for propagation of the waves from the membrane 
center to the cap pole and back again was 2
/
H c0, where c0 is the sound velocity in 
air. This is less than the time of the wave propagation from the support to the center 
(R c0 ). As a result, the double-layer membrane achieved a large deflection at the 
center. The single-layer membrane had, after CIB, a center deflection smaller than 
the double-layer membrane, because the shock wave passed by the single-layer mem-
brane and loaded it less than the double-layer membrane.
The large final deflection only in the external layer is explained by the interaction 
of the layers and peculiarities of the air flow through the double-layer net. The shock 
wave air flow through the double-layer net seems more complex than that through 
the single-layer net or the perforated plate. The paradoxical peculiarities of the air 
flow through the double-layer net were noted in [56].
Thus, CIB of the cap/permeable membrane system is associated with aerody-
namic processes (both with the reflection of the blast wave 11 (Figure 7.16) from the 
concave side of the cap and loading of the membrane center by the reflected converg-
ing shock wave 33 (Figure 7.16) having the amplitude equal 5.2 MPa). The influence 
of unloading of the membrane material (steel wire) was small.

Experimental Data
7.3.3  ciB of panelS
The large volume of experiments was carried out in Russia from 1972 to 1985 
[13,48]. The purpose of the experiments was not studying the anomalous and coun-
terintuitive behavior (CIB) of impulsively loaded structural elements. Therefore, a lot 
of results have not been fully saved.
Here, we consider some data concerning the anomalous and CBIs of cylindrical 
and conical panels subjected to blast loading. A scheme of experiments and using 
equipment were described in [13,48]. The experimental data testify that the paradox-
ical results are possible for different structural elements and under various impulse 
loads. However, the structure must be flat or shallow. The time of positive pressure 
loading must not significantly exceed a quarter of the period of the fundamental 
frequency of the structural element. The influence of the amplitude and shape of the 
external pressure pulse, peculiarities of the structure – blast interaction, and material 
properties of the structure is very important. Sometimes, CIB can be accompanied 
by local plastic deformations. However, typically the plastic deformations were usu-
ally small during CIB.
Cylindrical panels. The thickness of the panels varied from 1 to 3 mm. One side 
of them was 14, 21, or 28 cm, and the other side was 14 cm and the radius R = 41 cm. 
The blast load moved along the panels (traveling load) or was normal to panel sur-
face. CIB was usually observed for the traveling load. If a time loading was larger 
than the fundamental frequency of the panel, then a dent occurred. If this time was 
reduced, a few waves were generated dependent on the angle. CID had place along 
the central line and/or near the straight edges of the panels. Two specimens after the 
test are presented in Figure 7.18.
Conical panels. The length of the specimens was 20 cm and h = 1 mm. The 
radius of large side was 13.5 cm and that of the small side was 8.5 cm. The cone

angle was 30°, and the circumferential angle was 60°, 75°, or 90°. A small traveling 
load forms the one dent along the central line of the panels (Figures 7.19 and 7.20). 
Sometimes, small amplification of this load changed the deformation history dra-
matically; that is, the displacement strongly increased and counterintuitive displace-
ment took place at the central line. Near the straight edges the dents were generated.

205
Experimental Data
Some results of the experiments are presented in Figure 7.20: the solid line defines 
the dents of thickness h (1), the bright circles correspond to stable panels, and the 
dark circles correspond to the dents of 0.6–0.7 h. The dark triangle corresponds to 
the anomalous form (2), whereas the bright one corresponds to the snap-buckling 
with a large amplitude.
Dynamical buckling is a very complex process which is very sensitive to imperfec-
tions of structures. This process can sometimes be accompanied by elastic unloading 
of the material and formation of waves. In particular, the part of the loaded struc-
tural element can obtain a final displacement to the direction of the initial loading. 
A   “crater” (cylindrical shell) and a “peak” (conical shell) forms of the structure 
after impulsive loading which are the partly directed contrary to the direction of the 
impulsive loading are, for example, shown below.
The above processes are complicated in the cases of panels and finite shells. 
For example, if we have a shell under an internal pressure.
The above process complicates if there are static loads. For example, if we have 
a shell under an internal pressure, then the shell can obtain the final displacement 
opposite to the direction of the dynamic external pressure as a result acting of the 
internal static pressure!
Conclusion. The survey of the publications and the experimental data in this chapter 
testify that the occurrence of CIB is possible for different structural elements and under 
various impulse loads. However, the structure must be flat or shallow. The time of posi-
tive pressure loading must not significantly exceed a quarter of the period of the funda-
mental frequency of the structural element. The influence on CIB of the amplitude and 
shape of the external pressure pulse, peculiarities of the structure/blast interaction, and 
material properties of the structure are very important. CIB can be accompanied by 
local plastic deformations. This can lead to local failure of structural elements.
The examples of the failure of the double-layer plate (in the center and near the 
edge) and the cap (in the pole) have been given. In the first case, only the elastic layer 
has failed. The plastic (metal) layer remained intact. The failure was caused by the 
intensive bending waves of stress. They were generated near the edge and focused on 
the center of the plate because of one oscillation, which was excited first by the shock 
wave loading and then reverse snap-buckling. The failure of the cap was also caused 
by the bending waves traveling from the edge to the pole and vice versa. These waves 
were generated by snap-bucklings of the cap which followed one after another and 
had a large amplitude. The plastic membrane strains appeared near the pole as a 
result of the shock wave pressure loading, and then the high-frequency oscillating 
bending waves arrived. They caused the fatigue failure of the metal in the pole.
The geometry and loading of the failed cap did not strongly differ from those 
of the plate (test 1 of the table). However, the plate kept intact because the bending 
waves generated by CIB of the plate are weaker than those generated by CIB of the 
cap under the action of the similar load. The membrane stresses in the plate are also 
smaller than those in the cap.
The discussion of the experimental data has had been entirely qualitative. The 
complete analysis of the experimental results requires numerical calculations, theo-
ries and data from aerodynamics, structural dynamic mechanics, and the mechanics 
of dynamic plastic failure.

8.1.1  inveSTigaTion TechniqueS
This section discusses the influences of small perturbations of the parameters of the 
loading, structure (including shell form and curvature), and the numerical scheme on 
the deformation within the ranges where reverse snap-buckling occurs. The analysis 
is based on the numerical calculations performed on the one-dimensional equations 
of the various structures.
Transient motions of a plate, a thin shell in the form of a spherical cap (or cupola), 
and a cylindrical panel of infinite length in one direction were studied. Timoshenko 
equations of motion (see Section 1.5.1 and [47–57]) were used.
Nonlinear terms in equations of motion were taken into account accord-
ing to [50,62]. In particular, it is supposed that all the components of the strain tensor 
∂W 

in any shell point are small as compared to unity (εij << 1), and 

<< 1. Under 
∂r 
these conditions, normal displacement W of a shell can be of the order of thick-
ness and even larger, but it should be small as compared to the main geometrical 
dimension of the shell. Shallow shells are considered for which the ratio of the main 
geometrical dimensions to the curvature radius is much less than unity (e.g., for a 
spherical cap R0/R ≪ 1). The theory of shallow shells enables studying displacement

comparable with the shell rise value. It is widely used in studies of shells response to 
a dynamic load [36,43,47,50,62].
For the spherical cap under axisymmetric loading, the equations of the noted 
above nonlinear theory of the shallow shells take the following form (see, also,

placements, or of the shell curvature, we get different equations of motion for beams

The radial and tangential strains ε11, ε22 and the shear strain ε13 of the layer at a dis-
tance z from the middle surface of the structural element are expressed in terms of 
the radial and transverse displacements U, W and the rotation angle ψ. For example, 
in the case of the spherical cap, the forms are
	
Here, the function f(z) expresses the shear stress distribution over the thickness of the 
plate or shell [47,61]: f(z) = 6[1/4 − (z/h)2].
Expressions (8.4) and (8.5) differ from those written for an elastic body in terms 
of accumulated plastic strains. These terms can be found using the constitutive equa-
tions for the stress–strain behavior of materials. Some important properties of this

The above equations are sufficient for study of the elastic–plastic strain of struc-
tural elements [1]. They contain both the finite and infinitesimal quantities and are 
valid only for small plastic segments of the stress–strain curve. An iteration step-
by-step algorithm is constructed to solve the plastic problems. For each step n in 
accordance with this algorithm, the calculation proceeds by first regarding the accu-
mulated plastic strain increments as known ones (see Section 1.2 and Figure 1.3). 
Assuming wholly elastic behavior, Eqs. (8.1)–(8.5) are solved to obtain increments of 
stress resultants, total strains, and displacements and rotation angle. If the yield con-
dition is violated, the increments of stress and strain are recalculated using the itera-
tion algorithm so that the yield condition is satisfied. The iterative algorithm used has 
been described in Ref. [62]. An explicit difference scheme was used for the solution 
of the equations of motion, according to which the displacements and rotation angle 
are obtained at the mesh nodes, whereas forces, moments, and strains were found at 
the centers of the mesh elements. The number K of mesh elements defined over the 
surface of the body was varied from 15 to 25 in the calculations.
The plates and shells studied were assumed fully clamped along the boundary 
contour and to have zero initial displacements and velocities. Uniformly distrib-
uted pressure pulse over the surface was applied. The load instantaneously reached 
the value P and was removed after reaching the maximum positive deflection. The 
plates considered were made of aluminum alloy D16AT for which ρ = 2.8 g/cm3, 
E = 720,000 MPa, and ν = 0.3. The bilinear approximation of equation (8.6) in accor-
dance with Figure 8.1 were also used (σ0 = 282 MPa, E1 = 1500 MPa).
8.1.2  reSulTS and diScuSSion: plaTeS, Spherical 
capS, and cylindrical panelS
Extensive numerical calculations both within and outside the ranges in which coun-
terintuitive behavior (CIB) was observed were included in this study. The ranges 
are typically characterized by quite small plastic deformations and stress states 
approaching the momentless (membrane) case.
Plates. We first show results of numerical studies of Eq. (8.1) with r/R = 0 and 
plate radius R0 = 55 mm, showing the insensitivity to small changes of the plate 
thickness h and of the mesh number K.
Figure 8.2 shows the center deflection–time curves for five values of the pulse load 
parameter P. The solid and dash-dotted curves are for h = 1 mm and K = 15 and 25, 
respectively; the dashed lines are for h = 1.05 mm and K = 25. For the smallest value, 
P = 0.4 MPa, the behavior is essentially elastic, whereas for P = 1.0 MPa, the plastic 
deformations are large enough so that the plate remains bent in the direction of the 
loading. These cases indicate the intuitively expected behaviors: small changes in 
the parameters of the structure, the loading, or the numerical scheme produce corre-
spondingly small changes in the observed response. The range of pulse magnitudes 
between these extremes illustrates the range in which the behavior is counterintuitive 
in two respects: first, there is an abnormal sensitivity to small changes in the two

parameters; and second, the final vibration takes place about a mean deflection that 
may be either positive or negative. After deflecting in the direction of the loading, the 
structure snaps through to the opposite side. In some cases, the deflection remains on 
that side (with negative deflections), whereas in others, it snaps back to and remains 
on the positive side. The curves for P = 1 MPa in Figure 8.2 illustrate the fact that 
when the plastic strains are larger than a certain magnitude, the solution becomes 
stable with respect to small changes in the parameters.
Results of further calculations of this type are shown in Figures 8.3–8.5. 
The number of elements of numerical mesh K and the thickness h were fixed. 
In Figure 8.3 curves numbered 1–5 correspond to P = 0.4, 0.5, 0.66, 0.687, and 
0.689 MPa, respectively.
In Figure 8.4, curves numbered 1–5 correspond to P = 0.75, 0.775, 0.777, 0.8, 
and 1 MPa, respectively. In each figure, there are groups of curves which apparently 
coincide up to a certain time and then bifurcate, i.e., visibly separate. For example 
in Figure 8.3, curves 3, 4, and 5 coincide up to a time t of approximately 0.58 msec 
when the curves 4 and 5 diverge from the curve 3; subsequently, the curves 4 and 
5 appeared coincide up to a time of approximately 1.38 ms and then separate. The 
points where the bifurcation occurs are marked by large black circles. The smaller 
the difference in P, the longer the delay in the appearance of this point.
In Figure 8.5, a much narrower band of pulse magnitudes is studied: seven curves 
are plotted for P ranging from 0.800 to 0.811 MPa. Four points of bifurcation are 
marked: t = 0.4 ms (curves P = 0.8 and 0.81 MPa), t = 0.55 ms (curves P = 0.81 and

(curves P = 0.8105, 0.8103, and 0.81027 MPa). The pattern suggests that the diver-
gence is occurring exponentially, a characteristic feature of chaotic vibrations. It 
should be noted that the pulse force magnitudes have been chosen arbitrarily within 
certain ranges. (The term “bifurcation” is used here as a descriptive term to describe 
the appearance of visible separations, which are not bifurcations in the technical 
sense commonly used, namely of changes in the type of solution, for example from

oscillatory to nonoscillatory, which takes place at a particular value of a parameter. 
Here, they are due to a general property of the system of equations, i.e., an extreme 
sensitivity to initial conditions. Two solutions, starting from closely neighboring ini-
tial values, diverge exponentially rather than linearly. Hence, after a period in which 
they apparently coincide, they separate and may after sufficient time lose all resem-
blance to each other.)

internal energy, 3 is the work done in plastic deformation, 4 is the kinetic energy, and 
5 is the elastic strain energy.
FIGURE 8.5 The results of the numerical investigations of the bifurcation possibility of 
the plate motion equations are plotted for P ranging from 0.800 to 0.811 MPa. Four points of

and 0.811 MPa), t = 0.8 ms (curves P = 0.811, 0.8105, and 0.81025 MPa), and t = 0.95 ms 
(curves P = 0.8105, 0.8103, and 0.81027 MPa).

The curves 1, 2, and 4 were computed according to classical formulae [47,61,62], 
whereas the curves 3 and 5 were obtained from the stress–strain diagram. The 
curves for P = 0.7 MPa correspond to a case when CIB may occur. Figure 8.6 shows 
the require for CIB. CIB takes place if the energy dissipated in plastic deformation 
is approximately the same as the sum of the kinetic and elastic strain energies. The 
internal work does not change greatly after the load is removed. It characterizes the 
precision of the calculations.
Spherical cap. Figures 8.7 and 8.8 show results of calculations mainly assum-
ing elastic behavior of a spherical shell in the form of a cap (or cupola). Taking 
R0 = 55 mm and h = 0.5 mm, two cases were considered: f = R0/11 and f = R0/5.5. 
The pulse load was applied from the concave side. Its type and amplitude were cho-
sen from consideration of behavior of flat plates.

numbered 1–4 correspond to P = 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 MPa, respectively).

calculated for P = 0.6 MPa at successive instants of time: t = 0, 0.1, 0.34, 0.4, 0.55, and 1.00 ms.

Figure 8.7 shows center point deflection–time curves calculated for f = R0/11. 
The curves numbered 1–4 correspond to P = 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 MPa, respectively. 
Elastic behavior was assumed in all cases except curve 4, for which plastic deforma-
tion was considered. It is seen that snap-buckling can occur with wholly elastic and 
with elastic–plastic behavior.
Shell profiles numbered 1–6 are shown in Figure 8.8 for P = 0.6 MPa at succes-
sive instants of time: t = 0, 0.1, 0.34, 0.4, 0.55, and 1.00 ms. These profiles are plot-
ted schematically, without adheres to ratios of real geometrical dimensions. It can 
be seen that a wrinkled or wave-like concentric shape appears during the passage 
from the positive to the negative region of displacements. The shell appears to prefer 
a snap-buckled state. Figure 8.9 shows the external work and internal energy, and 
demonstrates the satisfactory precision of the calculations.
Calculations made with rise f = R0/5.5 indicate that when the curvature is 
increased, the shell stiffness increases. Plastic strains occur at small displacements. 
These strains hinder a snap-buckling after load removal.
Cylindrical panel. Shallow cylindrical panels were studied with span between 
supports 110 mm, rise f = 4 mm, and thickness h = 0.5 mm; the long dimension was 
assumed infinite. A pulse of uniform pressure pulse was applied on the concave side. 
P was taken in the range from 0.05 to 0.8 MPa. Results of numerical solutions of 
Eq. (8.2) are shown in Figures 8.10–8.12.
Figure 8.10 shows midpoint deflection–time plots for six pulse magnitudes rang-
ing from 0.35 to 0.80 MPa. The curves labeled 1, 2, and 3 correspond to P = 0.8, 0.6, 
and 0.55 MPa, respectively. Substantial plastic deformation occurs in these cases. 
Curves 4, 5, and 6 are for P = 0.40, 0.375, and 0.35 MPa, respectively. As the plastic

range of the counterintuitive behavior of the cupola (P = 0.6 MPa).

deformations are reduced, the panel snaps through to a deflection in the reverse 
direction approaching twice the rise height (4 mm) of the undeformed shell.
Figure 8.11 shows additional plots for P in the neighborhood of and smaller than 
0.375 MPa. Finally, Figure 8.12 shows response curves for eight values of P in the 
narrow band between 0.379 and 0.3801 MPa. These show that small perturbations of 
a fiducial curve lead quickly to solutions with no resemblance to the fiducial.
If the curve for P = 0.38 MPa is regarded as the fiducial curve, the other curves 
correspond to perturbations δP ranging from 0.000001 to + 0.001 MPa. As the incre-
ment δP decreases, the time of separation increases. (There is a rough proportion-
ality between −log |δP| and the separation time, indicating an exponential rate of 
divergence between the fiducial curve and the curve for the perturbed pulse mag-
nitude). It can be seen that a change in P from 0.37990 to 0.37991 MPa; or from 
0.379910 to 0.379911 MPa leads to a large change in the response curve. This great a 
sensitivity to a parameter change is absent in normal response of panels.

drical panel. Curves labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 correspond to P = 0.8, 0.6, 0.55, 0.40, 0.375, 
and 0.35 MPa, respectively.

crosses are for P = 0.37 and P = 0.1 MPa.

Conclusions. For some structural elements (bars, plates, and shallow shells), it 
is found that within certain ranges of the parameters of loading, it may be impos-
sible to predict the response behavior. This is because for these structures, obeying 
nonlinear equations of motion, there may be an extreme sensitivity to changes of the 
parameters in these ranges. Actual values are known in practice only with a finite 
degree of uncertainty, and the behavior must be regarded as unpredictable. This 
phenomenon occurs typically in a range during the transition from purely elastic 
behavior to mixed elastic and plastic response. This phenomenon differs from clas-
sical snap-buckling of shells [1,47,61] because it occurs within small ranges of the 
problem parameters.
8.2  INFLUENCES OF ATMOSPHERE AND CAVITATION ON CIB
Thin circular plates are considered in this chapter with their edges being fixed in 
two different ways. In the first case, the plates are considered to be fully clamped in 
an absolutely rigid screen separating the liquid from the atmosphere. In the second 
case, they are fixed in a thick annular plate, the outer edge of which is clamped in 
the abovementioned screen. For the second case, the calculations will be made for a 
plate of variable thickness with a thin central circular and thick peripheral annular 
parts (Figure 8.13). In some instances, the calculation results will be compared for 
the above two cases in order to study the influence of clamp condition on the pos-
sibility of anomalous behavior. It should be noted that some deformability of the

(Chapter 7).
Deformations of the plate take place as a result of an instant explosion in the liq-
uid near the plate center at the symmetric axis of the system (Figure 8.13).
The equations and boundary conditions describing the plate/liquid/underwater 
explosion interaction are presented below. The algorithm of the plastic strain cal-
culation for the plate is outlined. Hydrodynamic equations are written according 
to different models of the generation, development, and disappearance of cavita-
tion. Particularly, a model of the bubbly liquid is described. The expansion of the 
explosion products is described by the gasdynamic equations. Under the action 
of the underwater explosion, the plate deforms into a curved shape which may 
lose its stability as a result of both unloading of the structure material and the 
influence of the atmosphere. The anomalous behavior of the system is realized as 
snap-buckling of the plate toward the liquid. It is associated with the initiation of 
cavitation in the latter and can occur for both fully clamped and deformable edges 
of thin plates.

8.2.1  TheoreTical ModelS
Here, we remind the models described in Part I which will be used below.
	
The edge of the plate was fully clamped in the screen W = U = ψ = 0. For 
plates of variable thickness, it was also assumed that W, U, and ψ changed 
continuously along the coordinate r.
The conditions of the plate/liquid interaction are described by q = P and 
W = vz (z = h/2). These conditions do not take into account the displacement 
of the plate/liquid contact surface because the effect of this displacement 
on the noted interaction is much less than that of nonlinearity of the plate 
equations and the cavitation in the liquid (Section 1.4.3 and Chapter 3).
	
2. Models of liquid and gas. We used the models described in Chapters 1 and 
3. In the general case, the liquid may be considered either as keeping its 
continuity or as being ruptured. Four models of the liquid and the model of 
explosion products, which will be used for the calculations, are described 
below.

2.2. Liquid models taking into account the cavitation phenomenon. 
Transient cavitation has not been studied enough because physical 
and mathematical problems of the investigation of the initiation and 
the development of gas bubbles in the liquid are very complicated. 
Beforehand the site and time of the appearance (disappearance) of gas 
bubbles (cavitation zones) and the motion of them in the bulk of the 
liquid are unknown. Consequently, all approaches taking into account 
the initiation of cavitation during the transient structure/liquid interac  
tion are based on a more or less simplifying statements.
Let us assume that the Eq. (8.7) is used for the medium in the cav-
itation zones. The property of the cavitating liquid in these zones is 
described by the equation of state.
	
a. Bilinear (constant pressure) model [62–64]. Experiments show that 
in cavitation zones, the pressure only varies slightly and hence it 
may be considered to be equal to the constant Ps. Then, the equa-
tion of state for the cavitating liquid can be given in the following 
form:
	
=
P
Ps. 
(8.10)
The magnitude of Ps is of the order of 0.01 MPa. The condition for 
the initiation of cavitation at some point of a liquid (rupture crite-
rion) may be written as (Chapter 2)

The Δt value is of the order of 10 μs; for the sea water, Pk is 
(−0.2) − (−0.35) MPa. In condition (8.11), P < Pk, i.e., the integra-
tion is conducted only when a negative pressure at the point liquid 
exists which is less than Pk. If the pressure does not drop very 
rapidly a less accurate but more convenient condition (8.12) is used 
instead of (8.11) to calculate the time and the site of the cavitation 
appearance:

b. Bilinear (constant sound velocity) model [62]. The ruptured liquid 
in the cavitation zones contains gas bubbles. Due to this fact, this 
liquid is compressible although its density does not really change 
during compression. That is why the sound velocity in such liquid 

221

is considerably lower than that in the pure liquid or air. The sound 
velocity, as, varies slightly in the cavitation zones. Let as = const.:
	
ρ =
dP
d
as
2 
(8.14)
Conditions for the initiation of cavitation (8.11), (8.12) and its disap-
pearance (8.13) do not change. Equation (8.14) is similar to Eq. (8.9) 
for an ideally elastic liquid. The increase of liquid compressibility 
is taken into account in the cavitation zones since as ≪ a0. In the 
case of as = 0, Eq. (8.14) becomes analogous to Eq. (8.10).
Remark 1. In Ref. [9], it is emphasized that some analogy exists between the models 
of the behavior of an elastic–plastic body and the liquid capable of cavitation. In both 
cases, the use of different constitutive equations (equations of state) depends on the 
fulfillment of some criteria of the variation of the important mechanical properties 
of the medium. For example, the criterion σe > σ0 of the plastic strain generation for 
an elastic–plastic body is similar to the criterion (8.12) for the cavitation initiation for 
a liquid. The sites of the zones where the liquid will exhibit the cavitation properties 
or the body will show plastic properties are not known in advance and are defined 
by the calculation.
	
2.3. Bubbly liquid. Let us consider the motion of a liquid which contains 
the same spherical uniformly distributed gas bubbles. The volume of 
the gas is much smaller than that of the pure liquid. The exchange of 
the mass, momentum, and energy between the gas and the liquid is not 
taken into account. The length of the pressure wave in the mixture is 
much larger than the distance between the bubbles and their radius R. 
There is no interaction between the bubbles, which are under uniform 
pressure. The velocity of the bubbles and the liquid with respect to 
each other is equal to zero. The quantity of bubbles in the mixture does 
not change with time.
If the initial gas concentration is low, the properties of the mixture 
in the compression zones do not differ appreciably from those of the 
pure liquid. In tension zones, however, gas bubbles begin to extend and 
change the properties of the mixture. An equation of state for the bub-
bly liquid can be presented (Chapter 3) in the following way:

Equations (8.7)–(8.15) suffice to determine all the hydrodynamic 
unknowns. These equations can be simplified if the pressure waves in 
the liquid are much larger than the radius of the bubbles R (the case of 
long waves). Then, we can neglect the terms on the left-hand side of Eq. 
(8.16) and obtain P = Pg. Taking into account the latter equation and Eq. 
(8.17), we rewrite (8.15) as

In compression zones, Eq. (8.18), in fact, coincides with Eq. (8.9), 
but in tension zones, it exhibits essentially new nonlinear properties. 
Equations (8.7) and (8.18) are much simpler than the initial ones ((8.7) 
and (8.15)–(8.17)). They are somewhat more complex than the equa-
tions for the pure liquid (8.7) and (8.8). However, they describe more 
correctly the behavior of a real liquid, where there is always some quan-
tity of gas bubbles and where the appearance of high negative pressure 
is practically impossible. Its absence can be shown analytically, if γ = 1.

Here, we take into account the pressure Ps of the saturated vapor of the 
liquid in the cavitation zones. From Eq. (8.19), it follows that the pres-
sure in a bubbly liquid is always positive even when ρ → 0 if Ps > 0 (see, 
also, Eq. (1.68)). Equations (8.7) and (8.19) form a simple system for 
studying a gas bubble/pure liquid mixture.
Figure 8.14 gives a scheme of the changes in the curves correspond-
ing to the equations of state for some models of the liquid. Curves 1, 2, 
3, and 4 correspond to the ideal elastic model (8.8), bilinear (constant 
pressure) model, bilinear (constant sound velocity) model, and the bub-
bly model (8.19), respectively. Curve 5 corresponds to Eqs. (8.15), (8.16), 
and (8.17) which take into account the inertia properties of gas bubbles 
in the liquid. It has been shown that in the compression zone, curves 1

through 5 actually coincide, whereas in the tension zone (P < Pl0), only 
curves 2 through 5 give nearly similar description of nonlinear proper-
ties of a real  (cavitating) liquid.
Remark 2. It must be emphasized that a considerable negative pressure inside a very 
short tensile underwater waves can appear as a result of the inertia of the bubble 
extension. However, in present case, negative pressure in the liquid is small or absent 
because only long waves are considered here.
Remark 3. There is the analogy between the theories of transient cavitation of a 
liquid and the dynamic rupture of materials. For example, rupture criteria (8.11) and 
(8.12) were widely used to estimate the material strength inside of tensile waves. It is 
known that the development of voids inside of tensile waves is described by an equa-
tion of the type (8.16) (see Chapter 2).
	
2.4. A wide-range equation of state of water (1.49)–(1.52). An equation 
of state for water that holds in a wide range of thermodynamic param-
eters was presented in Section 1.3. From Figures 8.14 and 8.15, we 
can see that the above models of the cavitating liquid, developed on 
the basis of various physical assumptions, are in good agreement (see, 
also, Section 1.4.3. The bubbly liquid model allows to study both the 
transient cavitation and the cavitation oscillations of a liquid.
2.5. The ideal gas model. Let us assume that the temperature of the explo-
sion products does not vary and Eq. (8.7) hold for these products. The 
equation of state is represented by the adiabatic law: P = P  (ρ/ρ )γ

Plate. Thin circular plates were considered which were either fully clamped in an 
absolutely rigid screen (the case of a smooth plate) or fixed in a thick annular plate 
(the case of a plate of variable thickness) (Figure 8.13). The radius of the thin plate 
was 55 mm, and its thickness was either 0.7 or 1 mm. The thickness of the thick 
annular plate was 8 mm, and its width was 55 mm. The plates considered were made 
of aluminum alloy D16AT for which ρ = 2.8 g/cm3, E = 72,000 MPa, and ν = 0.3. 
Bilinear approximation of Eq. (8.6) in accordance with Figure 8.1 was also used 
(σ0 = 282 MPa, E1 = 1500 MPa).
The calculations were made by a mesh-analysis method using the explicit proce-
dure. The equations of motion (8.1) were integrated numerically. The displacements 
and rotation angle that were determined in the mesh nodes, whereas strains, forces, 
and moments were determined in the mesh center. For plates of variable thickness, 
the calculations were carried out at each time step in two stages. In the first stage, the 
unknown values U, W, and ψ were determined for the thick part of the plate using the 
cell of the thin part adjacent to the thick one. Then, we calculated the same unknown 
values for the thin part of the plate. In doing so, the U, W, and ψ values obtained in 
the first stage for the edge of the thick part of the plate were assumed to be boundary 
ones. The size of the mesh cell side was 3.67 mm.
Gas–liquid system. A computational scheme for treating the cavitating liquid 
has been devised by Galiev [50,62,64]. He used the velocity potential and the acous-
tic or nonlinear acoustic assumption. A highly efficient computational scheme for 
treating the cavitating liquid was also developed by Newton [65]. He used the dis-
placement potential and the acoustic assumption. Here, as discussed in [15,27], we

do not consider the liquid flow as irrotational. The above different models of the 
liquid are used. The equations of the liquid and gas motion were integrated using 
Wilkins’s procedure [66].
The gas cylindrical volume (explosion product) was at a distance of 51.1 mm 
from the plate. Its length and radius were equal to 14.6 mm. The place for explosion 
(Figure 8.13) was chosen so that the accuracy of the calculations was provided. The 
numerical mesh was such that its boundaries in water do not influence the results of 
the calculations; that is, the numerical mesh used began to expand at the velocity of 
sound in the liquid from initial region (0 < r < 367 mm, 0 < z < 381 mm) after the 
explosion.
In the region (0 < r < 147 mm, 0 < z < 161 mm) adjacent to the plate, we used a 
uniform numerical mesh with a cell side 7.33 mm in length. Thus, the gas volume 
was divided into eight cells. Outside the boundaries of the abovementioned region, 
the distance between the mesh nodes changed nonuniformly. The cell sides along 
the coordinates increased three times in the range 147 < r < 367 mm and 161 < z < 
381 mm, and then six times if r ≥ 367 mm and z ≥ 381 mm.
Plate/liquid contact condition. To satisfy the plate/liquid contact condition, 
we performed calculations at each time step in two stages. Initially, we calculated 
the liquid parameters using the plate velocity found previously. In the second 
stage, new displacements of the plate were calculated using the resultant pressure 
of the liquid.
Initial conditions. The initial velocity of the gas was equal to zero. Different 
initial values of P0 inside the explosion products were used, but density ρ0 of the 
explosion products was always assumed to be 1.65 g/cm3. The plate was assumed to 
be motionless at t = 0. Other parameters of the system considered corresponded to 
undisturbed values for room atmospheric conditions. For example, the pressure of 
the liquid was equal to the room atmospheric pressure when t = 0.
A negative pressure (Ps = Pk = −0.1 MPa) was usually assumed to exist in cavita-
tion zones. According to Ref. [30], anomalous behavior of the plate occurred when 
the final displacements were of the order of (3–5)h, which was used to determine the 
initial pressure of the explosion products in present calculations.
While calculating the gas and the liquid parameters, the time step ranged from 
1 to 2 μs. The results showed that the latter time step provides a sufficiently high 
accuracy of calculations. The plate displacements were calculated with the time step 
equal to 0.2 μs (h = 1 mm) or 0.1 μs (h = 0.7 mm).
8.2.3  reSulTS and diScuSSion
Numerical investigations of the possibility of the anomalous behavior of the plate/ 
liquid/underwater explosion system were carried out by using different liquid 
models.
Some results of numerical experiments for a plate of variable thickness are plot-
ted in Figure 8.15 for different values of P0 inside of the explosion products. The 
thickness of the central part of the plate was 1 mm. It is shown in Figure 8.15 that the 
anomalous behavior of the plates is possible when the initial values of P0 are between 
10 and 15 MPa.

226
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
The displacement–time curves calculated at point r = 0 of the smooth plate 
(h = 1 mm) for different P0 are plotted in Figure 8.16. The curves demonstrate the 
transition from elastic to plastic deformation within the region of the anomalous 
behavior. The calculations show that within this region, the maximum curvature 
of the plate has the order of the curvature which characterizes a shallow shell. The 
plastic strain energy was of the order of the elastic and kinetic energy [8].
The influence of the Ps value on the occurrence of the anomalous behavior of the 
plate was studied. For Ps = 0, the snap-buckling also occurred. However, when we 
excluded the action of the atmospheric pressure (Pa = 0), the reverse displacement of 
the plate was not observed in the case when Ps = 0.
In Figures 8.17 and 8.18, curves calculated using the different models of the liq-
uid behavior are presented. The calculations were performed for P0 = 10 MPa and 
P0 = 5 MPa (curve 5 in Figure 8.18) in the region of the anomalous behavior illus-
trated in Figure 8.15.
The smooth plate displacements at the point r = 0 calculated for h = 1 mm are 
presented in Figure 8.17. Curve 1 was calculated using the equations of the ideal 
elastic model (8.8), curve 2 was calculated by the bilinear (constant pressure) 
model, curve 3 corresponds to the bilinear (constant sound velocity, as = 10 m/s) 
model, curve 4  corresponds to model (8.20), and curves 5 and 6 were plotted for the 
bubbly liquid model (8.19). The above models of the liquid behavior were defined 
by some constants. Most of them were presented above. When calculating curve 4, 
we assumed T being equal 293 K. For the bubbly liquid model, two cases were 
considered: nV0 = 10−4 (curve 5) and 9 × 10−6 (curve 6). Curves 2, 3, and 6 coincide. 
Calculations of curve 1 were carried out up to 423 μs. The deflection reached 10 mm 
and the arithmetic unit of the computer was overflowed because of the increas-
ing pressure. For this reason, it was impossible to complete calculations using 
Eqs. (1.49)–(1.52) (curve 4).

CIB of Plates and Shallow Shells
The above results show that the consideration of the cavitation and static (atmo-
spheric) pressure is an important condition for studying the anomalous behavior of 
the plate loaded by an underwater wave.
The calculated results for displacements at points r = 0 (curves 1–5) and r = 55 mm 
(curve 6) for different plates are presented in Figure 8.18. Here, we used the bilinear 
(constant pressure) liquid model. Curves 1, 2, 5, and 6 were plotted for plates of vari-
able thickness. In the central part, h = 1 mm (curves 1 and 6) or 0.7 mm (curves 2 
and 5). Curves 3 and 4 correspond to smooth plates with h = 1 mm and h = 0.7 mm, 
respectively. We can observe snap-buckling of a thin plate (h = 0.7 mm, curve 5) even 
when P0 = 5 MPa.

Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
Thus, the reverse snap-through buckling appears to occur both in smooth and 
in stepwise varying plates. The influence of the peripheral part of the plate on the 
displacement of its central point is small. Figures 8.15–8.18 show that the possibility 
of anomalous behavior exists not only in the case of an idealized fully clamped plate 
but in the case of realistic boundary conditions (not fully motionless edge).
The region of the anomalous behavior which exists in the plate/water/underwater 
explosion system is not very small. The amplitude of initial pressure P0 can change 
approximately twofold, while the possibility of the snap-buckling holds.
Let us consider the changes in the surface pressure of the plate of the variable 
thickness. These changes corresponding to curve 2 in Figure 8.18 are shown in 
Figure 8.19. The analyses of the pressure curves and other results of the calculations 
reveal that the rate of the cavitation formation on the plate is very high (t = 40 μs). 
Cavitation disappears at the instant of the plate motion retardation (t = 450 μs). In the 
range of 450–600 μs, the plate changes the direction of its movement and the pres-
sure on it rises rapidly. A pressure impulse is generated by the plate and then propa-
gates into the depth of the liquid. The pressure upon the plate decreases rapidly again 
resulting in the cavitation process which does not stop until the end of calculations.
Figure 8.20 shows the curves of W variation along r corresponding to curve 2 
shown in Figure 8.19 for different values of time. The central part of the plate 
deformed only and the mean rate of reverse snap-buckling was approximately two 
times larger than the mean rate of the positive deflection.
Conclusions. The anomalous behavior of the structure/liquid/underwater explo-
sion system covered in Ref. [11] was studied by considering the initiation of the cavi-
tation in the liquid. Thus, the above anomalous behavior is connected not only with 
unloading of the plate material but with the transient cavitation in the liquid together 
with the action of the atmospheric pressure. A necessary condition of the anomalous 
behavior of the described system is the coincidence of the appearance of unloading 
and the transient cavitation in the liquid, which can be achieved only in a narrow 
range of the system parameters.
The negative pressure can occur on the surface of the plate when subjected to 
loading by the underwater explosion. The magnitude of this pressure is limited by the 
cavitation effect, and the negative pressure promotes the occurrence of anomalous

2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 correspond to t = 30, 32, 40, 500, 600, and 900 μs, respectively.

behavior. The similar effect occurs in structures under blast loading, when the 
depression wave loads the structure after a shock wave pressure load. The pressure 
in the depression wave can drop to zero and promotes to the anomalous behavior of 
the structure.
Anomalous behavior exists not only in the case of a fixed-end structure but in the 
case of the flexibly supporting condition.
Within these ranges of loading, the nonlinear equations of motion for the above 
elements are so sensitive to the perturbations of the parameters that it is impossible to 
predict the dynamic behavior of real structural elements by solving the equations, since 
the initial parameters and loads are always known approximately and any corrections 
of them can significantly change the result of calculations. The anomalous behavior is 
associated only with those structural elements which deform into shallow shells during 
loading phase and then lose their stability under the action pf unloading forces. In a flat 
plate, the anomalous final deflection due to reverse snap-buckling appears only with 
elastic–plastic deformation. In contrast, this effect for spherical and cylindrical panels 
may be for viscoelastic, elastic, and elastic–plastic material behavior.
In this part, a nonlinear (elastic–plastic) model of material behavior is used. 
Nonlinear problems are always difficult to understand. Even in the case of the simple 
models [18,20–25], they are able to demonstrate very complex chaotic behavior. The 
butterfly effect has become a well-known symbol of the dynamic behavior of real non-
linear systems. (The combination of words butterfly effect gained popularity thanks to 
the article: Lorenz, E. Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly’s Wings in Brazil Set 
off a Tornado in Texas? 1972. http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Butterfly_1972.pdf)
The idea is that, in many strongly nonlinear systems, effects of even small initial 
perturbations may be very large. These effects increase according to the exponential 
law, which makes it impossible to make long-term forecasts.
FIGURE 8.20 Dynamics of reversal of the plate interacting with the liquid: curves 1, 2, 3, 
4, 5, and 6 correspond to t = 0.4, 0.6, 0.9, 1, 1.15, and 1.7 ms, respectively.

Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
Thus, the considered CIB is part of a huge problem in which predictability over a 
short period of time due to the use of deterministic equations is replaced by unpre-
dictability over a long period of time because of the effect of a small disturbance in 
the initial data. Strictly speaking, the results of the numerical calculations are the 
extension of the classical results of Henri Poincaré and Edward Lorenz to elastic–
plastic systems.

Part IV
Extreme Waves Excited by Impact 
of Heat, Radiation, or Mass
Imagination is no less important for a geometrican
than for a poet in his moments of inspiration.
Jean D’ Alembert
It is shown in Chapters 7 and 8 that behavior of material of structure elements can 
strongly depend on parameters of shock loading. In this part, we continue to study 
the similar effects in material of structure elements in cases of very short and intense 
loads leading to the appearance of extreme waves of heat, destruction, melting, and 
evaporation. It is known that thermomechanical behavior of the material during the 
impact action by the extreme wave, in many respects, is determined by its length and 
amplitude. These parameters determine the temperature and pressure arising in the 
medium and consequently, the phase state of the matter. It is important to remember 
that in a very wide range of temperature and pressure, the matter does not exhibit 
strength properties. At temperatures of the order of 105
6
−10 K (K is Kelvin tem-
perature), the matter exists as plasma, and at 104
5
−10 K, it is in the gaseous state. 
Only in a condensed (liquid or solid) state, which can take place up to temperatures 
of the order of 104 K, the matter has the property strength. The strength properties of 
the matter decrease with increasing pressure. As the pressure increases from values 
of the order of MPa, the properties of the matter are more accurately described by 
the models of liquid or gas.

Part IV
The influence of various physical effects is determined by a time of existence 
of them. Despite the existence of “in-principle” mutual influence of many  physical 
processes, there is often the main effect which is determined by the matter  behavior 
(state) within various time or space intervals. Processes of the evaporation, the 
heat propagation, and the emergence of stress waves can be often considered 
independently.

of Heat Waves
The classical parabolic model for heat conduction, for many choices of thermal 
conductivity, predicts an infinite speed of heat diffusion. The hyperbolic model of 
heat conduction considered here is more physically realistic as a finite speed of heat 
 diffusion is predicted.
The relaxation model of heat transfer assumes the heat flux equation in the 
 following form (1.13):

where T is the temperature, W is the heat flux, and κ ( )
T  is the thermal conductivity. 
As earlier, letter subscripts denote differentiation with respect to the corresponding 
value. The relaxation time τ determines a time after which a heat flow forms when 
the temperature gradient is imposed. The first term in the left side of (9.1) differs this 
model from the classical Fourier law. In contrast to the latter, Eq. (9.1) describes the 
finite velocity of thermal waves.
Mathematical formulation of the problem includes also the energy conservation 
law (1.3) written in the following form:

9.1  LINEAR ANALYSIS – INFLUENCE OF HYPERBOLICITY
It is known that the propagation of heat is described by the parabolic-type equation. 
However, for nano- and picosecond range impacts, the rate of physical processes is 
such that the energy absorbed by the matter does not have time to distribute between 
electrons and more inertial atoms of the atomic lattice. Thus, for intervals of the 

236
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
order of 10−11 s in the microvolume of the matter the thermal flux W is not estab-
lished instantly as it is predicted by the classical Fourier law. In this case, the heat 
flux will increase gradually from zero to maximum, and it is necessary to use the 
modified Fourier equation (1.13) so that the process of thermal conductivity can be 
described. This equation follows from the energy equation after discarding ther-
mal and electron terms, and also terms related to the deformation of the medium. 
Thus, there appears the possibility of formation and existence in matter of a heat 
wave. This wave is the result of the hyperbolicity of the modified linearized Fourier 
 equation (1.13). The front of this wave may be steep enough; however, the shock front 
cannot form because the equation used is linear. In this case, Eq. (9.3) becomes

To numerically study the influence of radiation frequency on the heat propagation, 
various presentations of the laws of the heat conduction are used below. Calculations 
were carried out with the following thermophysical constants: CV = 900 J/(kgK), 
κ = 250 W/mK, and τ = 10−10 s (W is a unit of power (Watt)).
The wavelength determines the depth absorption of the energy by the matter. The 
impulse is assumed to be instantaneous. For the description of the radiation energy, 
the Bouguer–Lambert law is used [1]. We considered the long wavelength and short 
wavelength range of the radiation frequency. For the absorption coefficient in the 
law, we used two values: −L = 10−

m  (short 
wavelength).The initial radiation energy was given exponential (see, for details, 
Chapter 10).
Figure 9.1 shows the fronts of the heat wave calculated for the long wavelength 
radiation according to a linear parabolic (curves la, 2a, 3a) and the linear hyperbolic 
FIGURE 9.1 Fronts of a thermal wave for a linear parabolic (curves la, 2a, 3a) and linear

10−12 s. The absorption occurs in a very narrow layer. It can be seen that 
for a short time, the wave substantially changes its form and amplitude. However, if 
in the case of a parabolic equation, the wave is simply smooth, then for the hyper-
bolic equation there is a separation of the heat pulse from the loading surface and its 
advance into the depth of the material. The maximum temperature is not located on 
the loading surface. According to the hyperbolic model, the heat produced directly 
on this surface is greater than the heat calculated according to the classical heat 
equation.
It should also be noted that the time required for these processes is less than 
the characteristic time of mechanical phenomena, and therefore, the corresponding 
thermal dynamics in an essential way affects the formation of the compression pulse 
in the material.
Another picture is observed in the case of short-wave absorption. In this case, the 
absorption zone has a thickness of the order of 10−4 m. The results of  calculations 
according to the parabolic and hyperbolic equations were practically the same. There 
is a slight change in shape and amplitude of thermal wave for the characteristic time 
of mechanical processes, which we consider the order of 10−3 s.
Thus, we can conclude that the thermal processes, that occur in the material, 
strongly depend on the wavelength of the radiation. It is impossible to neglect the 
processes of thermal conductivity during of the action of a long-wave radiation. If 
we are interested in the emerging and spreading impulse stress, then the hyperbolic 
equation shows large amplitudes for the temperature, and consequently, we have the 
large compression wave. The effect of the thermal conductivity on the stress can be 
understated, and the strength of the structural element may be overestimated if we 
use the classical heat equation.
Heat pulses quickly decay, for example, in metals at a distance of L < 10−7 m and 
in porous materials of −L < 10−4 m. At the same time, experiments show [2] that for 
temperatures close to absolute zero, the thermal impulses propagate slightly chang-
ing their form. In this case, they are analogous to acoustic waves. The heat pulses 
can very weakly decay. In particular, in very thin multilayered materials even their 
amplification is possible [1].
Amplification of thermal waves – Numerical analysis. The above analytic 
study of the possibility of amplification of thermal waves on the contact surface is 
based on a number of assumptions about the character of the solution of the equa-
tions [1] (see for details Chapter 10). Let us check this possibility solving numerically 
the hyperbolic equation for two-layer material. Initially, the wave is excited in the 
first layer. In accordance with theoretical analysis [1], the amplification may be done 
if the second layer has smaller conductivity and a large coefficient of thermal relax-
ation than the first layer. The characteristics of the first layer were presented above, 
and for the second layer, we take CV = 900 J/(kgK), κ = 25 W/(mK), and τ = 10−9 s
. We assume that at t = 0, the temperature varies as the stair. The initial and final 
profiles of waves calculated in two-layer structure are shown in Figure 9.2.
The wave profiles for a single layer are given in Figure 9.2 too. In the latter case, 
the formation of a wave profile of temperature and its propagation with the damp-
ing are shown. In the case of a two-layer material near the interface, a peak of 

238
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
temperatures is formed, the amplitude of which is approximately twice as high as 
that calculated for single layer. Thus, a numerical calculation performed without any 
assumptions about the nature of the solution of the equations describing the propaga-
tion of heat fully confirms the result of an approximate analytical study [1].
The amplification of thermal waves in thin-layer structures can cause danger 
to their durability. On the one hand, some inner layer can melt if its critical melt 
temperature was appreciated according to the classical heat equation. On the other 
hand, the growth rate of the temperature amplitude might be quite large to exert a 
significant influence on the stress–strain state and lead to the formation of dangerous 
stresses.
9.2  FORMING AND AMPLIFYING NONLINEAR HEAT WAVES
Let us turn to the Fourier equation with nonlinear heat conductivity (9.1) and (9.2) 
or (9.3). In this case, the steep wave fronts can be formed in the matter. Therefore, 
the heat flow will be hindered due to the equality to zero the temperature just before 
the front. At the same time, the temperature on the heat front is maximum, so the 
heat flux is also maximum. As a result the steep heat front is conserved. However, 
there are specific heat conditions for realization of this scheme: special form of the 
 coefficient of thermal conductivity and the requirement that the amplitude of the 
heat wave was significantly higher than the initial background heat along which 
the front moves.
Two-speed wave front in liquid helium. Thermal waves were studied both 
experimentally and theoretically [2–5]. It turned out that these waves can manifest 
themselves only in very extreme exotic conditions, i.e., metals at short-term energy

impacts or cryogenic liquids at temperatures close to absolute zero. Above the gen-
eration and propagation of linear thermal waves in multilayer metal structures were 
studied [1,6,7]. The below is a numerical analysis of the propagation of such waves 
in liquid helium.
The purpose of this section is to provide the proof of suitability of the nonlinear 
relaxation model of heat conductivity for describing the main features of forma-
tion and propagation of waves of the second sound in liquid helium. This section 
discusses the possibility of the amplifying such waves. Experimental recording 
of second sound in He II [8] together with the detection of other specific effects 
caused the intense researches of quantum cryogenic liquids. Theoretical explana-
tions [5] were related to the existence of thermal waves having a clearly pronounced 
front and a finite speed. This gave an impulse to extensive researches in the field of 
the so-called generalized thermodynamics created for a description of this range 
of temperature [9]. Thanks to the development of experimental techniques, addi-
tional details of the formation and the propagation of heat waves in liquid helium 
were  discovered [4,10]. The necessity of interpretation of the received information 
required the development of an adequate mathematical model. It was found that the 
accounting for the relaxation and nonlinear thermal properties of cryogenic liquids 
is sufficient for a detailed description of the experimental data.
Two-stage waveform of the second sound. An initial research item is the 
results of the studying of waves of the second sound obtained in [4]. Dynamics of 
temperature arising in the volume of liquid helium due to pulsed heat generation 
in the form of a rectangle was recorded. In Figure 9.3, it is clearly shown that for 
W0 =
×

10 W

/m , the temperature profile has a clearly expressed two-step form. 
The velocities of the steps are different. Existence of the second step is explained by 
processes of local boiling of the overheated liquid which is discussed in [4]. However, 
the two-step structure of the second sound wave can be modeled without additional 
physical mechanisms [10].
The thermal behavior of cryogenic helium is expressed by Eq. (9.3). Additionally, 
we take into account the dependences of coefficients of thermal conductivity κ ( )
T  [3] 
and specific volume heat capacity CV [8] from temperature T. These dependencies 
are displayed graphically because it is very difficult to describe them analytically 
[7,11] (Figure 9.4).

The measurements of the second sound velocities are given in [3]. The coefficient 
of thermal relaxation τ weakly depends on the temperature [3]. Therefore, it was 
assumed as constant and equal to 0.00472 sec. The density of liquid helium is 
1500 kg/m2. Thus, Eq. (9.1) combines two mechanisms for the formation of thermal 
waves [7,11], related to the relaxation term and the nonlinear term.

The first of the conditions determines the heat flux W0 at the left boundary of helium 
volume, and the second condition corresponds to the heat-insulated wall. The solu-
tion of the formulated boundary problem was sought numerically. The numerical 
method is described in [1].
The results of the calculations are shown in Figure 9.5. There is the correspon-
dence of the calculations with experimental data. It should be noted that the lines 
shown in Figure 9.5 represent instantaneous distributions of the temperature over the 
volume of helium. On the contrary, the lines shown in Figure 9.3 display the evolu-
tion of temperature at a volume point. However, it is well known that in dynamic 
problems usually, these lines strongly correlate with each other.
A distinct two-wave form of the thermal wave is observed (the fronts a and the 
fronts б). Variations show that the speeds of both waves are independent of the load. 
The velocity can be estimated from formula (9.5). As a result, we obtain u2 = 19m/s. 
FIGURE 9.4 Dependencies of heat capacity (a) and heat conductivity (б) [3] of helium from 
the temperature.

241
Forming and Amplifying of Heat Waves
At the same time, numerical calculations give the value of u2 = 20m/s. Thus, the 
results are in good consent. The formation of a steep temperature front can be 
explained by joint action nonlinearity and hyperbolicity in Eq. (9.3).
The relaxation term in Eq. (9.1) takes into account the finite time for establishing a 
thermal flux in the microvolume of helium after action of temperature gradient. This 
effect hinders the passage of heat into the medium and increases the steepness of the 
thermal profile. The steepness growth in the case of a nonlinear mechanism is asso-
ciated with the difficulty of passing of the heat from a heated and heat- conducting 
substance on the crest of the wave to a relatively colder and less heat-conducting 
helium before its front. Some of front blurring is explained by the fact that the areas, 
having different temperatures, move with various speeds.
Formation of the second thermal step in the framework of this model can be 
explained as a result of establishing an equilibrium between the heat arriving to the 
surface z = 0 and the heat flux from z = 0 due to thermal conductivity. The latter 
grows with increasing temperature, though not proportional to it. At the same time, 
the formation of a steep front and its speed are explained, as above, by the features 
of the liquid itself and therefore do not depend on the loading.
Reflection and amplification of wave steep front. The formation of a cooling 
wave during the heat wave reflection from the heat-conducting layer was shown in 
the experimental paper [4]. We will study this very interesting phenomena below.
Let us consider the reflection of a thermal wave from a non-heat-conducting sur-
face. Some results of calculations are presented in Figure 9.6. It shows the growing 
of the wave amplitude as a result of the reflection.
Twenty-five percent of the amplification occurs. Then, with the approach of the 
second level (step) of the heat wave, the temperature stabilizes. More calculations 
allowed us to determine that the degree of amplification does not depend on the 
 nonlinearity thermophysical parameters. This effect occurs more because of the 
relaxation properties of liquid helium.
As a result of the studies carried out in this section, we have described the fea-
tures of the formation two-step (two-speed) experimentally observed wave of the 
second sound by the model that takes into account thermal relaxation of the medium

and the nonlinear dependence of thermophysical parameters from temperature. The 
possibility of amplifying a thermal wave during its reflection from the heat-insulated 
surface was noted.
Comment. There is an analogy between propagation of the second sound waves 
and the waves propagating in weakly cohesive materials (see Chapter 3), bubbly liq-
uids (see Figure 19.5), and elastoplastic materials [12]. In the last case, the processes 
may be described by the one-dimensional nonlinear wave equation:

z . The last is determined by the stress–strain 
curve. According to (9.8), many solids can propagate two kinds of waves: elastic 
wave having the velocity ae and the plastic wave having the velocity ap. Since ap
e
< a , 
they form the two-step structure.
Thus, the elastic wave propagates faster than the plastic wave. Generally speaking, 
the speed of the elastic wave is constant. The speed of the plastic wave depends on 
the loading. As we see, this phenomenon is quite similar to particularity of  thermal 
waves which was considered above.
9.3  STRONG NONLINEARITY OF THERMODYNAMIC FUNCTION 
AS A CAUSE OF FORMATION OF COOLING SHOCK WAVE
A one-dimensional model of relaxation heat transfer was investigated numerically 
for the case of helium II manifesting strongly nonlinear properties. A complicated 
structure of the heat wave of cooling generated by negative temperature jump on 
the boundary surface was studied. Particularly, two parts of the negative heat wave 
(cooling wave) were revealed. The first part has a smooth profile, but the second part 
has a steep (shock-like) profile. The latter can be formed from the initially smooth 
wave. The generation of the nonlinear wave of additional cooling after its reflection 
from thermally insulated wall was also studied.

Forming and Amplifying of Heat Waves
Introduction. Below the point of the phase λ-transition (Tλ =
°
2.1768 K), helium 
obtains properties of quantum liquid (He II) and exhibits an unusual behavior. 
The propagation of temperature waves with finite velocity and clearly manifested 
temperature profile is one of the physical effects appearing in helium at cryogenic 
temperatures that is referred to as “second sound”. Peshkov [13] was the first who 
observed it experimentally.
The theoretical basis for the investigation of this phenomenon is the  relaxation 
model of the wave-type heat transfer. Beginning with the pioneer work of 
Maxwell [14], the model was developed by a number of authors [15–17] and accepted 
for description of behavior of liquid helium. Theoretical analysis of the relaxation 
heat transfer was performed primarily within the framework of linear approxima-
tion [15] where the integral transformation is applicable.
However, near the temperature of phase transition the helium heat capacity tends 
to infinity [8]. Thus, the linear approach becomes inapplicable. The use of non-
linear equations was hindered by difficulties associated with the scarcity of the 
exact analytical solutions and the lack of generally accepted relations for thermal 
conductivity of liquid helium. The examples of the solution of nonlinear problems 
of heat conductivity are a few in number, and the numerical simulations dominate 
among them [18]. It was demonstrated, particularly, that the structure of thermal 
wave profile (second sound wave) generated by the energy pulse in liquid helium is 
very complex [13]. But the details of initiation and development of wave structure 
were not studied enough.
While the generation of compression shocks in continuum is a matter of common 
knowledge, the formation of thermal shocks during the heat propagation is a new 
issue in physics. The temperature jumps in this case may be considered as pressure 
jumps. In the light of relatively recent finding of rarefaction shock waves that were 
thought to be nonexistent for a long time [17], it is reasonable to suggest that thermal 
shocks of cooling (traveling negative temperature jumps) are also possible. But up to 
now, they have not been studied either experimentally or theoretically.
The objective of this section is to numerically demonstrate that the thermal 
shocks of cooling can be generated in liquid helium and these waves may be formed 
from smooth temperature profiles. Nonlinear reflection of the waves from thermally 
insulated boundaries with the generation of additional cooling is also studied.
Basic relations and governing equation. The nonlinear heat wave equation 
is written in the form (9.3). Let us note this is the quasi-linear hyperbolic partial 
 differential equation. Taking this in mind, we can interpret the value (9.5) as the 
velocity of the heat wave. Solving (9.5) with respect to thermal conductivity, one can 
obtain

Corresponding temperature profiles are plotted for five instants in Figure 9.8.
The formation of a temperature jump (the front of the thermal wave) traveling 
with the velocity about 21 m/s can clearly be seen. During the considered time, 
the wave profile complicates and two parts of it can be distinguished. No profile 
change is manifested in the upper part, and its displacement is parallel to itself. 
At the same time, the lower portion of the profile changes its form during the propa-
gation because of different velocities of points of the temperature profile.
The upper part of the temperature profile is the heat shock of cooling, i.e., the 
vertical jump of finite amplitude. The width of jump because of numerical represen-
tation is not zero. However, it reduced to almost zero when a size of the numerical 
mesh was reduced to zero. The lower portion of the profile represents the smooth 
nonlinear relaxation thermal wave. Its slope decreases during the wave evolution, 
and the obtuse angle at the point of the wave parts conjugation also decreases.
The thermal wave behavior described above can be explained qualita-
tively as follows. The thermal wave velocity is maximum (Figure 9.7) at the

temperature near 1.8°K. Thus, the profile portions located either upper or lower, 
and then, this critical temperature travels more slowly than the point at which the 
temperature is just 2°K. The evolution of the initially straight temperature profile (1) 
into the wave of cooling (2) is sketched in Figure 9.9.
We can notice that the slope of the upper portion of the temperature profile 
becomes steeper due to the velocity growth together with temperature within the 
temperature interval considered. For the lower part of the curve, the trend of the form 
change is inverse.
The latter of the described processes has no physical limitations, but the steep-
ening of the upper part of the profile can continue only while the slope is less than 
π/2 and the temperature-coordinate correspondence is one-to-one. After this, the 
 cooling shock or traveling negative temperature jump is formed.
The formation of cooling shock due to the strong nonlinearity of thermodynamic 
properties of helium was additionally validated by the numerical simulation of the 
temperature evolution initiated by а linear decrease of the boundary temperature.

Forming and Amplifying of Heat Waves
clearly manifested for all instants considered, but it is less for late instants. A gradual 
formation of the steep temperature curve from the gently sloping one can clearly be 
seen for the temperatures higher than Tmax.
Beginning in 0.5 ms, the shock wave is formed completely and travels with a con-
stant velocity (21 m/s), which is evident from comparison of the upper parts of two 
profiles considered in Figure 9.10. The coincidence of the lower parts of curves cannot 
ever be reached since their forms depend on the whole history of the wave formation.
The final part of the investigation involves the simulation of the cooled shock 
wave emerging at a thermally insulated boundary. The reflection of thermal waves 
in liquid helium from the solid surface was experimentally studied earlier in [19]. 
Theoretical analysis of this phenomenon was performed in [15] within the frame-
work of the linear approach.
The linear model predicts that the amplitudes of the arriving and reflected temper-
ature jumps are approximately identical, but in reality, the temperature is restricted 
by the absolute temperature zero. So for sufficiently big amplitudes of the reflected 
wave, the linear approach becomes inadequate. The temperature drop due to wave 
reflection in helium is limited by values of heat capacity and thermal conductivity 
when T →0. As a consequence, the thermal wave near zero temperature should 
generate the reflected wave with an appreciably smaller amplitude.
Figure 9.11 shows the results of the numerical simulation of the temperature wave 
reflected from a thermally insulated boundary. Due to a strong material nonlinearity,

the amplitude of the reflected wave is much lower than that of the initial wave. 
The further evolution of the thermal wave leads to gradual settlement of constant 
 temperature background.
The phenomenon described may probably be used for the additional cooling of 
liquid helium by reflected thermal pulses [20].
CONCLUSIONS
	
1. The structure of the heat wave of cooling in helium II in the case of 
strong material nonlinearity was studied numerically. Two portions of the 
 temperature profiles were revealed and investigated. The upper of them is 
cooling shock traveling with a constant velocity, and the lower (second) part 
is a smooth profile changing its shape during the propagation.
2. It was numerically demonstrated that the cooling shock can be formed from 
an initially smooth temperature profile and the causes and conditions of that 
transformation were found.
3. The generation of the nonlinear wave of additional cooling after ther-
mal shock reflection from thermally insulated solid surface was studied 
numerically.
4. The phenomenon of amplification of thermal waves in thin-layer struc-
tures may present a certain danger to their strength. On the one hand, it is 
 possible to reflow the internal fusible layer, calculated on the temperatures 
predicted by the classical the heat conduction equation. On the other hand, 
the growth rate amplitude of the temperature is large enough to have a sig-
nificant influence on the stress–strain state and leads to the formation of 
dangerous stresses.

10 Extreme Waves Excited 
by Radiation Impact
	
1. This chapter contains the results published in the USSR at the end of the 
last century. It developed the approach in which the separation of the prob-
lem into a gas-dynamic and strength parts in a wide range of variation of 
the impact energy, frequencies, and time of action of radiation was not used 
from the very beginning [1,6,7].
2. The behavior of the material on which the radiation pulse falls is largely 
determined by the wavelength and the radiation power. Figure 10.1 shows 
the regions of influence of the most important physical and mechanical 
processes manifested during the action of radiation [6]. It follows from 
the  figure that in the very wide temperature range (102–106 K), there is no 
effect of strength and material can be in the plasmous (105–106 K), gaseous 
 (104–105 K), and condensed (102–103 K) states [21–31].
Here, we study waves of pressure, stresses, and heat arising from the 
pulsed heating of material surface from 102 to 105 K. At low temperatures, 
when there is no melting, there are the processes of expansion of the near-
surface layers of the material and their destruction in the form of a surface 
spalling. The presence of melting and evaporation at higher temperatures 
leads to the complication of the formation of stress and pressure waves, 
which are determined both by the reactive recoil of the evaporation prod-
ucts and by the expansion of the unevaporated part of the solid.
The contribution of these two mechanisms to the formation of the waves 
depends on the intensity of the radiation incident on material. The effect

of reactive recoil can be increased until the manifestation of the effect of 
screening radiation by flying pairs of material begins.
	
3. Certain additional results of Russian studies of the action of the radiation 
pulse on materials can be found in [21–32].
10.1  IMPULSIVE DEFORMATION AND DESTRUCTION OF 
BODIES AT TEMPERATURES BELOW THE MELTING POINT
In this section are considered thermoelastic waves caused by impact radiation. 
Results published in [6,33,34] are used. Destruction occurs in rarefaction waves in 
the form of a surface spalling. The considered models relate to the action of long-
wave (thermal, laser) and short-wave radiation, acting during time less than 1 ns and 
more 10 ns.
10.1.1  TherMoelaSTic WaveS exciTed By long-Wave radiaTion
The long-wavelength radiation is absorbed in a very thin near-surface layer of mate-
rial of approximately 10−8 m. Therefore, in the mathematical formulation of the prob-
lem, this layer can be assumed to be infinite thin, and the energy source can be 
introduced into the boundary conditions for the temperature.
In [6,33], the effect of the energy flux on metallic targets coated with transparent 
liquid dielectrics was studied. The formula for the shock-wave pressure is derived 
under the condition that the amplitudes of the shock wave in the liquid and the ampli-
tude of the compression wave in the metal are equal:

where ρ1 and ρ1 are the densities of the liquid and the metal, respectively, D1 and D1

The next follows from a comparison of the pressure calculated according to 
(22.1) and the experiment (Figure 10.2) is discussed next. First, the theory and the 
experiment are in satisfactory agreement with the fact that the bulk of the energy is 
absorbed. Second, the energy of the recoil for copper and aluminum targets at about 
0.5 J/m2 is approximately of an order of magnitude, which is higher than that in the 
case of irradiation of the pure surface of a metal at the same densities of the radia-
tion flux.
10.1.2  TherMoelaSTic WaveS exciTed By ShorT-Wave radiaTion
A purely thermomechanical problem is being studied. A pulsed heat source is intro-
duced in the thermal part of the problem, and then, the propagation of the thermo-
elastic wave is studied. Short pulse radiation is absorbed in a sufficiently thick layer 
of matter. This effect may be simulated assuming the heat sources appearing in 
the material. The study of the formation and propagation of heat waves and stress 
waves generated by the action of this radiation on copper mirrors was performed 

251

in [1,6,34]. The heat propagation in these mirrors was described by the relaxation 
model of the heat flux (the modified Fourier law) (1.13). Therefore, heat sources and 
the inertial term was introduced in the classical heat equation. As a result, we have

The problem can be solved by using analytical methods [34].
A case of a stepwise loading of the body surface was considered. It is assumed 
that the material breaks down when the stress reaches the yield point. It was shown 
that the change in the temperature field in a metal occurs both as a result of the 
volume heat sources and due to the heat wave moving into the material with a con-
stant velocity. During the propagation, the amplitude of the thermal wave decreases 
exponentially.
In the material, there are two stress waves: a wave of compressive and tensile 
stresses. The last do not move with a velocity of elastic waves, but with the velocity 
of the thermal wave. The compression waves move ahead of thermal wave.
According to [34], the threshold of plastic deformations for the pulses longer than 
0.1 ns is approximately from 20 to 50 times smaller than that for melting of the 
mirror. For pulse durations less than 0.1 ns, this discrepancy increased. In the last 
case, the difference between the thresholds was more than 100 times due to dynamic 
effects (Figure 10.3).
Figure 10.3a shows the threshold of fracture of copper mirrors by melting of the 
surface (1–4) and plastic deformation 5 [34]. Experimental points are shown for 
wavelengths of the radiation of 1.06 × 10−6 m (1), 3 × 10−6 m (2), and 10.6 × 10−6 m (3). 
Curves 4 and 5 are the results of calculations: four takes into account the melting, 
and five appreciates the influence of the strength of the material.
It must be borne in mind for understanding Figure 10.3a that the theoretical 
thresholds of destruction by melting by the pulsed radiation are substantially higher 
than those obtained in the experiment (see points noted as 1, 2, and 3). Therefore, 
one should expect a similar decrease of the real destructive thermoelastic stresses in 
comparison with the theoretical ones.

Extreme Waves Excited by Radiation Impact
In Ref. [34], the influence of two dynamic effects on the allowable thermal load 
of mirrors was studied: the effect of the velocities of the propagation of the thermal 
and mechanical waves in the metal and the overheating of the electrons with respect 
to the crystal lattice. The first effect has a significant effect on the mechanism of 
mirror destruction and the second on the level of thermal stresses in the material 
(Figure 10.3). Figure 10.3b shows the effect of the duration of the laser pulse on 
the electron (curve 2) and lattice (curve 1) temperatures on the surface of a copper 
mirror at a radiation power density W t(

3 × 1012 W m2 (10.4). It is shown in 
Figure 10.3 that there is an equalization of the temperatures of the electronic and 
lattice subsystems with an increase in the time.
10.1.3  STreSS and fracTure WaveS in MeTalS during rapid Bulk heaTing
The results of a calculation–experimental investigation of the main characteristics 
of stress wave propagation and fracture processes in copper specimens exposed to 
pulsed high-current electron beams are given in [31]. An integral fracture criterion 
was used for estimating strength in the calculations. The data obtained illustrate the 
possibility of using the method of numerical modeling of wave and spalling phenom-
ena occurring during thermal shock.
The purpose of this chapter is a calculation-experimental investigation of the 
main characteristics of stress wave propagation and fracture processes in metals 
exposed to pulsed high-current electron beams. The maximum pulse energy of the 
electrons reached −3 MeV and pulse duration −10 ns. Copper specimens were used 
as the targets.
Figure 10.4 shows a schematic diagram of conducting the experiment and micro-
structure of the cross section of the copper specimen exposed to high-current elec-
tron beams e. Damages in the form of individual pores occur in the specimen.
FIGURE 10.4 Diagram of conducting the experiment and microstructure of the cross sec-
tion of the copper specimen as a result of thermal shock.

254
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
At the site of the most intense exposure (zone D), the pores merge into a main 
crack, which separates the specimen into parts. Furthermore, the temperature of heat-
ing the specimen was recorded in the experiments by means of copper- constantan 
thermocouples. These data were used further in calculations as the initial conditions 
for studying spalling phenomena and stress wave propagation.
Wave propagation processes in the specimens were studied by the method of 
numerical modeling on a computer. The problem was solved by means of a finite-
difference scheme in Lagrange variables with the introduction of linear artificial 
toughness. We examined an approximate formulation of the problem. Digressing 
from the specific physical nature of the radiation pulses, we assigned the temperature 
field in time and as a function of the coordinates. The following variants were exam-
ined. First variant: a 0.04 cm thick copper plate was heated instantaneously to 400°C 
uniformly over the thickness. Second variant: the specimen was heated statically to 
600°C, and then, the temperature was increased to 800°C. Such an approximate for-
mulation of the problem is possible, since a practically uniform energy distribution 
is characteristic for thin specimens (the density of absorbed energy over the depth 
differs by no more than 10%–15%).
The physical and mechanical characteristics for copper used in the calculations 
and their change as a function of temperature are given in Table 10.1, where K and G 
are, respectively, the bulk and shear moduli, σ y is the yield stress, and α  is the coef-
ficient of linear expansion. The melting point of copper is 1083°C.
The distribution of normal stresses over the thickness of the specimen for the 
aforementioned variants of loading is shown in Figures 10.5a and 10.6. 
It is seen that for t = 0.12 μs, tensile stresses are able to cause micro- and mac-
rofractures form in the specimen. For t = 0.23 μs, the formation of a pulse of com-
pressive stresses occurs anew in the plate, and for t = 0.34 μs, that of tensile stresses 
occurs; however, their value decreases (Figure 10.5). In the second variant, the wave 
picture is qualitatively similar to that in the first, but the value of the stresses is sub-
stantially less (Figure 10.6).
It is of interest to compare the results of calculations obtained in the second variant 
with the case when the temperature increases by the same value ∆
=

200°C from 
T =

This can be explained by the temperature dependence of the physical and mechani-
cal characteristics of the material.
The known results of investigating the temperature-time regularities of the frac-
ture process under rapid bulk heating conditions showed that temperature is one of 
the important parameters affecting this process.
An integral fracture criterion (see Chapter 2) [31] was used in the calculations for 
estimating strength. As the measure of damage, we took the quantity covarying from

tain constants of the material. The particular values of these quantities were selected 
from experiments on plane collision of plates, since the character of fracture and 
value of critical spalling stresses under the effect of electron beams and shock-wave 
loading agrees well [31].
The results of the calculations are given in Figures 10.7 and 10.8 in the form of the 
distribution of the measure of damage over the thickness of the plate and its change 
with time in the central part of the plate. 
We note that the most pronounced damages are localized in the center of the tar-
get, although damage, especially for the first variant, occurs almost over the entire 
thickness of the plate. This agrees well with the experimental result (Figure 10.4). 
FIGURE 10.5 (a and b) Distribution of normal stresses over the thickness of the specimen

FIGURE 10.6 Distribution of normal stresses over the thickness of the specimen with an 
increase in temperature from 600°C to 800°C.

256
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
It is also seen from Figure 10.7 that the value of ω increases during the forma-
tion of tensile stresses. In experimental investigations, wave propagation processes 
in metals subjected to intense thermal heating are most often studied by recording 
stresses by a piezoelectric transducer located on the back side of the target exposed 
to radiation. Furthermore, information about the propagation process and interaction 
of the waves can be obtained by means of a Manganin transducer, making possible 
continuous recording of the change in the main parameters of the shock wave. One 
of the schemes for measuring stresses consists in the following: the back side of a 
specimen of the material exposed to radiation is fastened to a material with a smaller 
acoustic stiffness. The stress at the interface is recorded by means of a transducer, 
from which a conclusion about stresses in the specimen is made.
The results presented illustrate the possibility of using the method of numeri-
cal modeling of wave and spalling phenomena occurring in a specimen exposed to 
pulses of high-current electron beams.
10.1.4  opTiMizaTion of The ouTer laSer-induced Spalling
Thermomechanical waves were considered. They can be so strong that in the rar-
efaction zones, the material can fracture. Controlled dynamic fracture experiments 
can be conducted on a variety of platforms such as gas guns, split Hopkinson bars, 
and lasers. Typically, a plane-fronted compressive wave is generated. It propagates 
FIGURE 10.7 Change in the measure of damage with time in the central part of the plate. 
Here and in Figure 10.8: solid lines – heating by an increase from 20v to 400°C; dashed 
lines – static heating to 600°C and then instantaneous heating to 800°C.

through the sample and reflects off a free surface. The compressive wave becomes 
tensile as it reflects off the surface. If the tension exceeds the material strength, 
fracture occurs. This kind of dynamic fracture is known as spallation. The problem 
of destruction of solid material, as shown in Chapter 2, is very complex. Therefore, 
simple models that illustrate well the main aspects of the process of the destruc-
tion are very important. Sometimes, they are very important for practice. One such 
model is presented in Ref. [35].
An analytic model of the outer spalling fracture caused by pulsed laser loading 
was developed. It was shown that our basic conclusions do not depend on the choice 
of a specific form of the model used to describe the absorption of pulse energy in 
the material.

where vρ is the axial mass velocity, σ  is the principal stress in the direction of radia-

spalling resistance, T0 is the surface temperature, L is the specific (per unit area) 
coefficient of attenuation of radiation in the material, CV is the specific heat capacity 
per unit volume of the material, and γ  is the Grüneisen coefficient.
The initial profile of temperature (the right-hand sides of Eqs. (10.12)–(10.14)) 
specifies the initial stress. We use three models of absorption, namely, the rectangular 
(version 1), triangular (version 2), and exponential (version 3) profiles (Figure 10.9). 
Note that the third profile appears when we use the classical Bouguer–Lambert law 
(10.44) [36] of absorption of the radiant energy in the material.

258
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
In deducing the system of Eqs. (10.10)–(10.14), it is assumed that the time of 
action of a pulse is much smaller than the time required for a wave to pass through 
the width of the absorption zone; that is, the pulse can be regarded as instantaneous. 
For pulses from the optical band, this corresponds to the duration of pulses vary-
ing within the range 10−8–10−10 s. It is also assumed that the absorbed radiant pulse 
energy is insufficient for local evaporation and melting; that is, the material remains 
solid for the entire process of fracture.
The decomposition of the initial stress state S z( ) = −σ (0, )z  leads to the formation 
of two waves. The first compression wave travels from the loading surface, and the 
second wave impinging upon this surface is reflected from it as an expansion wave.

ρ is the velocity of plane stress waves.
In Figure 10.10, the profiles of stresses and mass velocities are presented for the 
triangular profile of absorption of radiation. It is easy to see that the maximum ten-
sile stress attained on the moving boundary of two halfwaves gradually increases 
(for all initial profiles except rectangular). As soon as the maximum tensile stress 
exceeds the ultimate strength, we observe the formation of a plane cleavage crack 
perpendicular to the direction of loading.
The analysis of solution (10.15) shows that, for all three versions (10.12)–(10.14), 
the maximum of tensile stresses in the material is half as large as the level of com-
pression stresses formed on the surface at the initial time and equal to γ C T
V
0 2. This 
means that there exists the following critical value of the specific radiant energy (per 
unit area of the irradiated surface):

As soon as this value is attained, the material suffers outer spalling. It should 
be emphasized that the critical value of specific radiant energy depends only on 
the thermodynamic properties of the material and does not depend on its elastic 
characteristics.
If the value of specific radiant energy exceeds Esp, then, by using solution (10.15), 
one can find the thickness of spalled plates Zsp for all three versions of numerical 
calculations as follows:
     
The maximum possible thickness of spalled fragments computed by substituting 
relation (10.17) in relations (10.18) for all three versions of calculations is equal to

Thus, as the rate of rise of the initial pulse of heating increases for a constant coef-
ficient of attenuation of radiation, the thickness of the spalled plate decreases and 
approaches a limit independent of the radiation pulse energy.
If a cleavage crack is initiated, then a part of the mechanical energy of the wave 
is “locked” in the separated fragment. In this case, the momentum corresponding to 
the mass velocity of particles is also separated, which means that the spalled frag-
ment acquires a certain mean recoil velocity and the main body gets a recoil momen-
tum. For the indicated three versions of calculations, the mean velocity of the spalled

The analysis of the presented solutions enables us to conclude that the velocity of the 
spalled plate increases when the radiant energy exceeds its critical value. The same 
is true for the recoil momentum of the spalled plate with the sole exception that, in 
the exponential version, it is independent of the radiant energy.
The optimal depth of spalling is attained if we use pulses of radiation whose 
energy slightly exceeds the critical energy of outer spalling. Any subsequent increase 
in the radiant pulse energy leads to a decrease in the thickness of spalling.
10.2  EFFECTS OF MELTING OF MATERIAL 
UNDER IMPULSE LOADING
The elastic-plastic properties of the material, the possibility of its destruction and 
melting are introduced into consideration, but the transition of the material to the 
plasma state will be considered in Section 10.3.
10.2.1  MaTheMaTical Model of fracTure under TherMal force loading
A more general approach other than those considered in Section 10.1 was formulated 
in [37]. It was based on the equations of the continuum mechanics describing the 
propagation of the coupled thermo-viscoelastoplastic waves of fracture initiated by 
radiation. The wide-range caloric and thermal equations describing the transforma-
tion of matter from solid to liquid state were used. However, the transition of the 
material to the plasma state is not considered. The conservation laws of continuum 
mechanics are written in Lagrangian coordinates for averaged quantities [1,7,32]:

In this case, the system (10.22)–(10.24) describes also the temperature waves if the

Accounting for changes in material damage. Equations (10.22)–(10.24) are writ-
ten for the averaged values. Therefore, they are valid for porous and undamaged 
materials. Generally speaking, they can take into account the growth of pores in 
the material. Let us find the relationship of these quantities with the same values for 
an undamaged material. Now, we can consider the connection of these phenomena.
The increase in microscopic damage of the material is described by Eq. (2.49):

(10.24). In this case, the system (10.22)–(10.42) describes the interaction of tem-
perature, stress, and damage waves. The case when Q ≠0 in (10.24) is discussed in 
Section 10.3.
10.2.2  algoriThM and reSulTS
The essence of the above equations is that they describe a much wider range of phe-
nomena than the thermoelastic approach presented in Section 10.1. However, one can 
study this range of phenomena only by using numerical methods.
The mathematical model presented above allows to take into account the influ-
ence of various mechanical and physical phenomena on the propagation of extreme 
waves. In the following calculations, all of them will not be simultaneously taken 
into account, since the goal of the study is to obtain an understanding of the influ-
ence of various factors on the formation of extreme waves.
Algorithm of calculation. Calculations begin with the satisfaction of the bound-
ary conditions on the loaded surface [7,37]. In each numerical cell of the body, the 
equations of motion are solved, and thus, the velocities of cell boundaries are deter-
mined. The spherical part of the strain rate tensor (the rate of change volume) is 
calculated on the basis of the equation of continuity. The deviator components are 
found with the help of geometric relations. Now, the way to finding of the stress 
tensor opens. However, it is necessary first to solve the equation of microdamage 
growth, to take into account the effect of porosity on the stress state. If the value of 
the damage is larger than the critical level of microdamages ξ*, the number of this 
cell is remembered.

264
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
Now, we can find the values of cold pressure pρ and deviator parts of stresses 
using the certain state equations. While considering the latter, various algorithms 
are implemented for cells of viscoelastic and viscoplastic layers. In the first case, the 
calculations are performed using an explicit numerical scheme. In the second case, 
an implicit iterative procedure is used to find variable radius of the fluidity circle 
after which the components of the deviator are determined.
The stress is the sum of the elastic pressure, thermal and electronic pressure, and 
deviator components of the stress tensor. Then, the energy of cold compression is 
calculated. The total energy is calculated as the sum of cold and thermal compo-
nents. On the contact, boundaries of the layers satisfied conditions of ideal contact. 
Finally, on the free surface of a multilayer body boundary conditions for a free heat-
insulated surface are calculated.
Some quantities, for example, temperature and the relative volume, are trans-
ferred from one phase to another. To reduce the error of this approximation, we 
used the integration of the task in general. As a rule, convergence is achieved by two 
iterations. The inertia of heat transfer requires a numerical solution of differential 
equations with a small parameter τ (10.25). It can significantly degrade the correct-
ness of the numerical calculations; that is, in a number of calculations, three or four 
iterations were required at each step for the convergence of the calculations.
Thus, the numerical algorithm includes dynamical and thermal parts. The accu-
racy of the algorithms was verified by comparisons with known results. For the first 
part, we used the results described by M. Wilkins [38], and RI Nigmatulin and NA 
Akhmadeev [42,43] on the simulation of high-speed collision of plates without and 
with accounting for the destruction, respectively. The thermal part was checked by 
comparison with the analytical solution of the nonlinear heat equation (Chapter 9).
Results of calculations. In specific calculations, we studied a two-layer plate of 
materials A (iron) and B (aluminum). The mechanic and heat parameters for these 
materials are taken from [39–41,44]. The parameters of the kinetic equation (2. 27), 
defining the increase of the damage, are the same for materials A and B: ξ* = 0,075, 
τ  = 5 × 10−8 second, σ  = 25 × 108 N/m2
8 
2
k
t
, and σk = 18 × 10 N/m  [42,43].
The absorption of energy and the release of heat were assumed to be instanta-
neous (see Eqs. (10.41)–(10.43)). The heating leads to the instant expansion of the 
near-surface material. Simultaneously with the compression wave propagating into 
the depth of the material, the material of loaded surface is stretched (the rarefaction 
wave), which leads to the damage of the material, to the external splitting of the 
material. With the advance into the interior of the body, the wave amplitude falls off 
lee nonlinear damping. As a result, the level of the damage decreases.
A slightly different picture can be observed in the case of a multilayered body. 
During the entrance of compression waves into a less dense medium is possible 
growth of the pores due to the reflection of the pulse from the boundary as the 
stretching wave. This fact was confirmed by the solution of the problem formulated 
above, and by analysis of its acoustic variant (the acoustic variant does not take into 
account the inverse influence of microdamages on the stress–strain state, f ( )
ξ = 0 
(10.33)).
It was found that heat conduction and thermal coupling do not significantly 
change the wave amplitude. For example, Figure 10.11 shows the change in the form 

265
Extreme Waves Excited by Radiation Impact
of a thermal wave during the passage of a stress wave through the plate. It can be 
seen that this change is relatively small, but it occurs mainly at the moment of for-
mation of the mechanical pulse and becomes more intensive with an increase in the 
curvature of the thermal front. 
In Figures 10.12a and 10.13 for two moments of time are built the profiles of the 
stress waves σ  and the damage ξ, arising when the body is loaded with a penetrat-
ing heat pulse calculated according to the full and acoustic approaches (notations in 
Figure 10.13 correspond to the notation of Figure 10.12). From this, we see that the 
acoustic approximation lowers the thickness of the external splitting off material. 
Faster development of damage (failure) when taking into account the interaction 
of pores and stresses leads to a loss of energy of the tension wave in the spalling 
material. Therefore, according to the full approach, the tension wave has a smaller 
amplitude than the acoustic approach determines. The interaction of pores and stress 
leads to the fact that the damage zone becomes narrowly localized. 
The conclusion about insufficient accuracy of the acoustic approximation for the 
description the process of destruction is made from the analysis of curves shown in 
figures, which agrees with the data of other studies [39,40]. In the case of a two-layer 
material in addition to external splitting is possible internal splitting.
Separation of the heat pulse into two parts leads to deeper outside spalling than 
the one-time action of a pulse of double amplitude (Figure 10.14). This is explained 
by the rather slight dependence of spalling depth on load amplitude.

10.3  MODELING OF FRACTURE, MELTING, 
VAPORIZATION, AND PHASE TRANSITION
So far we have considered waves of heat, stresses, and destruction arising from the 
action of relatively weak radiation pulses. Next, we take into account the possibility 
of the plasma appearance. In particular, two models are introduced for consideration: 
The first mode uses the wide-ranged equations of state (see Section 1.1), and the 
 second model uses the separation of arising phases.
For the first (continuum) model, we continue to use the Eqs. (10.22)–(10.34). At 
the same time, the formulation of the problem changes because we replace the equa-
tions of state (10.35)–(10.37) by more general equations, which take into account 
the possibility of the material evaporation (the appearance of the plasma phase of 
material). When the second model is used, the surface of evaporation is determined 
at each step of the problem solution. The method of the previous part is used where 
material retains the strength characteristics. In the vapor zones, the equations of 
high-temperature gas are used. On the evaporation surface, the Knudsen conditions 
are written.

into account. Additionally, here we use the term ∂

The process of the transition of the solid to the liquid and gaseous states 
without explicit defining the phase boundary can be expressed using the

thermal component of pressure exceeds the greatest (negative) pressure of 
the cold component [44]:

2. The Knudsen model (conditions). When the second approach is used, the 
vaporization surface is identified in explicit form. Knudsen conditions are 
written on this surface, these being the boundary conditions of the prob-
lem. The part of the material, which has retained its strength properties, is 
described by (10.22)–(10.39), (10.44), and (10.45).
The motion of the gases (vaporization products) is described by equa-
tions that are valid for a high-temperature gas [18]:

from (10.50) for C
C

V = 5/3 are identical to those used in Ref. [46]. Thus, 
they constitute a special case of the equations for the Knudsen discontinu-
ity [45]. Eqs. (10.50) correspond to the Hugoniot relations for a shock-wave 
discontinuity except for the fact that these equations presume a two-velocity 
gas model. These equations are analogous to the Hugoniot relations for an 
ideal gas when C
C

V = 5/3.
The presence of a nonequilibrium Knudsen layer is due to the flow of 
particle returned to the surface of discontinuity from the gaseous medium. 
The magnitude of this reverse flow depends on the conditions of gasdy-
namic dispersal, characterized by the Mach number (M). The latter deter-
mines the quantity of mass vaporized and the rebound pressure [47]. The 
maximum value of M is unity. Here, the dynamics of processes taking place 
in the solid and gas can be examined independently of one another.
The Knudsen model, in accordance with [45], is augmented by the equa-
tion of energy balance at the discontinuity:

characterized by the specific power density associated with the incoming 
energy q t( ).
Thus, at M = 1 the second approach reduces to the solution of Eqs. 
(10.22)–(10.39) with the boundary conditions (10.50)–(10.52).

10.3.1  calculaTionS: effecTS of TeMperaTure
The complexity in studying the action of the energy pulse on solids requires spe-
cial effort to obtain results of calculations. Ways to verify them experimentally are 
limited due to extreme conditions that arise in small body volumes during very 
small time intervals. On the other hand, numerical experiments with models make 
sense only if the models are reliable. The reliability of calculations increases if vari-
ous mathematical models of the process under investigation and various numerical 
schemes of analysis are used [1,7].
Formation of waves near a loaded surface. We shall study the effect of the 
duration of the action of radiation on the formation of a stress wave near the loaded 
surface. The value of such study is that it becomes possible to compare numerical 
and analytical results. Here, the results from Ref. [7] are presented.

There is a strong difference between the calculated curves 1 and 2, although a 
qualitative similarity of the curves is observed also. It is interesting that according to 
curve 2, there is an unstressed zone between compression and expansion pulses. This 
effect seems paradoxical at first glance. It is not easy to comprehend it on the basis of

numerical calculations. At the same time, this feature also occurs in the linear case, 
which can be analytically investigated as discussed in Section 10.1.4.

cable to the case considered. Let us consider the following:

where Q( ,t z) is determined in (10.45). Further, we use the fact that the sum of two 
solutions of a linear homogeneous differential equation is also a solution. In addition, 
the general solution of the inhomogeneous equation is the sum of the particular solu-
tion of the inhomogeneous equation and the general solution of the homogeneous 
equation. Considering this, we study the initial stress pulse inside an elastic material 
(t = 0). Then, it breaks up into two pulses moving in different directions. Having 
reached the free boundary, one pulse is reflected by changing the sign.
According to the law (10.45), the initial temperature front is exponential. We 
replace the exponent with a triangle for simplicity. The dynamic of such impulse 
near the surface of the material is presented in Figure 10.16. It can be seen that 
this dynamics leads to the appearance of a wave that has areas of compression and 
tension.

It becomes more complicated when the energy loading is not instantaneous. In 
this case, the waveform emerging in the material can be more complicated than that 
shown in Figure 10.16. Let us consider the case of triangular heat release in a volume 
of a material. The profiles of the resulting stress waves depend on the duration. With 
instantaneous heat generation, the wave profile shown in Figure 10.17 (curve 1) is 
obtained (see, also, Figures 10.10 and 10.16). In the case of larger duration, a stress-
free zone between the compression and stretching zones (curve 2) begins to form. 
With a further increase in the duration (curve 3), a stress-free zone arises similar to 
that shown in Figure 10.15.

Interaction of heat waves and stresses. This issue was discussed already in 
Section 10.1. The results of analytical studies were used there. Here, we present the 
results of numerical studies presented in Ref. [7].
As is known (see Chapter 9), heat waves (heat pulses with pronounced steep front 
and rear fronts) can form when the heat is propagated in some absorbing materials. 
In particular, thermal wave amplification is possible in thin-film multilayer structure, 
if the thermal impedance of the next layer is greater.
In Figure 10.18 are presented the results of calculations for four cases. Calculations 
show a fairly significant decrease in the tension stresses (about 20%) due to thermal 
conductivity in a single-layer material. However, in the two-layer material, the effect 
can be reversed due to the thermal properties of the second material (for the effect of 
amplification of thermal waves, see Chapter 9).
Remark. However, it should be noted that the effect of thermal dynamics on 
the stress–strain state is rather weak and can be manifested only for small material 
thicknesses and for energy loading, which can be considered almost instantaneous.
10.3.2  calculaTionS: effecTS of vaporizaTion
In realizing the equations of the first (continuum) model, we used a numerical scheme 
described briefly in Section 10.2 [1,6,35]. For the second (Knudsen) model, the equa-
tions of the solid were integrated in accordance with the Wilkins scheme [38], while 
models from (10.49), (10.50), (10.51), and (10.52) were satisfied by means of the 
Newton–Raphson iterative procedure.
Simple test of temperature. We performed simple calculations in order to com-
pare the above-described algorithms in the solution of problems for a half-space 
filled with molten aluminum. An energy flux described by a step function and having

mal properties (3); and two-layer, heat-conducting material, where the layers have the same

curve 1 corresponds to the calculation in Ref. [45] based on the heat-conduction 
equation and Eqs. (10.50), (10.51), and (10.52). Curve 2 was obtained by solving 
Eqs. (10.22)–(10.34), (10.49), and (10.50) with known parameters from Ref. [45] and 
ξ = 0. Curve 3 shows the change in the Mach number over time and the presence of 
critical and subcritical flows in the Knudsen layer.
The curves obtained for temperature correspond to a point lying on the surface. 
The closeness of curves 1 and 2 indicates that the chosen model of the process and 
the algorithm used are sufficiently accurate. The general shape of the curves of T * 
can be interpreted as follows. Temperature initially rises rapidly due to the supply of 
energy. However, this increase becomes slightly slow due to the effect of heat-con-
duction processes taking heat deeper into the material. The quantity of heat moved to 
the interior gradually becomes comparable to the amount of heat supplied externally, 
causing the temperature curve to reach a steady level. When the external supply of 
energy is cut off, the surface of the body abruptly cools. The surface then cools more 
gradually in connection with the equalization of temperature throughout the body.
Modeling of vaporization and fracture. To perform and compare the results 
of calculations by the two models, it is necessary to determine the location of the 
vaporization zone in the material.
As it was noted, in the case of the first model we assume that the material is 
vaporized if the sum of the thermal and electronic energies in it exceeds the maxi-
mum amount of elastic tension energy. Then, the elastic energy cannot resist further 
expansion of the body, and the substance is assumed to undergo transformation to 
the gaseous state.
In the case of the second model, the calculations were performed in accordance 
with the assumption that М = 1. Thus, since the gasdynamic equations were not 
used, the rate of displacement of the vaporization surface could be determined from 
Eq. (10.52) after the simultaneous solution of (10.50) and (10.51).
The second important aspect of the numerical calculations was connected with 
allowance for the permeability of the vaporization products relative to the radiant 
flux. In the case of the first model, we assumed that the gas is opaque at V < V0 and 
that it becomes instantaneously transparent at V ≥V0 (V0 is the critical volume of 
clarification of the products). In the case of the second model, the question of clarifi-
cation of the vaporization products is irrelevant; that is, the gas beyond the Knudsen 
layer is assumed to be transparent.

Figure 10.20a shows the dependence of the mean rate of displacement of the 
vaporization front z on the energy flux q. The flow of energy starts at t = 0 and subse-
quently remained constant. The vaporization rate was determined after the vaporiza-
tion process reached the steady state. The curve 1 is calculated according to model 2. 
The curves 2–4 are calculated according to model 2 for V0 = 1.1 (curve 2), V0 = 1.2 
(curve 3), and V0 = 1.3 (curve 4).
The curves show that there is a nearly linear relationship between the logarithm 
of the energy flux and the vaporization rate. The curves also show that there is a 
range of loading rates within which a correlation exists between data on vaporization 
thickness obtained by the two models. The best agreements between the calculated 
results are seen at V0 = 1.2. With an increase in loading rate, the algorithm employing 
the Knudsen equations gives results which are somewhat higher than those obtained 
by the first model.
Thus, the data obtained according to the two mathematical models are in satisfac-
tory agreement. At the same time, it seems to us that the first model is more general 
than the second, since it does not use the assumptions that M = 1 (concerning the 
velocity of the gas flow beyond the vaporization zone). The most of the results pre-
sented below were obtained on the basis of the first model.
Having examined the vaporization of near-surface layers of a material in the 
steady-state regime, we turn to the study of essentially nonsteady sublimation. It is 
reasonable to compare different loadings in this case if we assume a constant value 
of E* = qτ  – the total energy of the pulse transmitted through a unit area of the sur-
face. In our calculations, we took E* = const. = 0.04 J/cm2.
Figure 10.20b shows the change in the mean vaporization rate calculated only 
for the time of action of the pulse. The curve 1 is calculated according to model 2, 
but curves 2 and 3 are calculated according to model 2 for V0 = 1.3 and 1.2, corre-
spondingly. An increase in loading time is initially accompanied by a sharp drop in

vaporization rate. This rate then stabilizes, which is interpreted as a transition from 
instantaneous vaporization to steady-state vaporization.
Another illustration of the above results is Figure 10.21a, which shows the depen-
dence of the thickness of the vaporized material on the duration of the substantially 
nonlinear pulse. At τ = ∆t = 10−9 second, there is a local minimum on the graph. 
Variation of the quantity V0 shows that the value of this extreme changes but it does 
not disappear. In certain sense, it is independent of the clarification threshold of the 
material during expansion. Such complex behavior of vaporization can be explained 
on the basis of the competition between the mechanisms of propagation of energy 
into the depth of the material and the clarification of its vapors. Given sufficiently 
short loadings, the energy absorption (stress waves, heat condition) is absent. This 
leads to the formation of horizontal sections on the curves (Figure 10.21a).
With an increase in loading time, its duration approaches to the characteristic 
time of dynamic processes and becomes sufficient for the removal of energy from 
the absorbing cells due to the escape of the stress wave into the depth of the mate-
rial. At the same time, the boundary cells expand. However, this expansion is insuf-
ficient for their clarification and, thus, for an increase in the number of absorbing 
cells. The flux of energy from the boundary region during the loading process leads 
to less intensive heating and a reduction in the volume of vaporized matter. A sub-
sequent increase in the loading time results in the clarification effect. The radiation 
penetrates deeper into the matter and the volume of vaporized matter increases, as is 
evidenced by the essentially nonlinear character of the change in the curves shown 
in Figure 10.21a.
Figure 10.21b shows the dependence of the stresses on time for two points of the 
solid. During the calculations, the different models of modeling of the vaporization 
process and different volumes of the critical clarification are used. The letter A cor-
responds to a cell adjacent to the vaporization surface, whereas the letter B corre-
sponds to the tenth cell beyond the vaporization front. It should be noted that while 
curves 2–4 of series A approach curve 1 with a reduction in V0, curves 1–4 of series

cannot be considered good. Even in the best case, the stresses calculated by the 
second model are nearly twice as great as the stresses calculated by the first model.
10.3.3  calculaTionS: effecT of vaporizaTion on Spalling
The reduction in the volume of the solid body is associated with both external spall-
ing and evaporation.
Each of the two specified mechanisms predominates in different irradiation 
ranges; that is, with the growth of the radiation, the splitting in tension waves is 
replaced by an impulse evaporation of near-surface material. Let us study more 
attentively the evaporation effect.
As shown earlier, if the radiation energy is not very large, then due to the thermal 
expansion of the surface material, it can be destroyed by spallation. If the radia-
tion energy is sufficient to evaporate the material, then the pressure of the resulting 
vapors will begin to impede the spallation, up to its complete disappearance. Of 
course, the above is only a rough outline. We will discuss the problem in more detail 
below.
Calculations were carried out for a single-layer plate of material A (iron) and a 
two-layer plate of materials A and B (aluminum). For calculations, it is necessary 
to specify the constants and functions included in the Eqs. (1.10) and (1.15)–(1.22). 
Parameters of the Eq. (10.27) determining the kinetic of the damages were for both 
materials the same: ξ* = 0.075, τξ =

We now present the results of calculations performed with allowance for all basic 
thermomechanical processes occurring under a pulsed loading of the surface by a 
flow of energy. The attenuation coefficient of the radiation L in (10.44) is assumed to 
be equal to 5.5 × 10−7 m−1. The loading was considered distributed. The energy flux 
Q0 in (10.54) varied by step law. The time of action of Q0 was 5 × 10−10 second, and 
the amplitude was changing. The cases Q0 = 1.2 × 106, 12 × 106, 36 × 106, and 12 × 
107 W/cm2 were considered. In these cases, the temperature reached on the surface of 
values 260°C, 2700°C, 8000°C, and 25,000°C.
Figure 10.22a–d shows the profiles of stress waves arising in a two-layer body 
under the specified loading cases. The numbers 1–3 are highlighted profiles at times

10−10 (1), 2.5 × 10−10 (2), and 4 × 10−10 seconds (3). The dot-dashed line 
defines the interface of the layers. The rupted lines are spalling surfaces. It is pos-
sible to trace the transition from a two-wave pattern (compression–rarefaction) to the 
compression wave. Changing of the destruction mechanism is clearly visible. Then, 
the destruction as a result of external splitting, characteristic of low radiation intensi-
ties, is replaced by evaporation. In the latter case (Figure 10.22d), the compression 
wave decays to the safe value from the point of view of the spalling strength at the 
depth of 10−5 m. It cannot cause the internal spalling. The regions of the evapo-
rated (z

Change of spalling into evaporation can be traced clearly. At the same time, com-
paring the results calculated on variants b and d in Figure 10.22, we conclude that 

278

the region of destruction does not necessarily increase with increasing the radiation 
amplitude. It is connected with the fact that the destruction of the material by split-
ting requires much less energy than its evaporation. Only beginning with enough 
high temperatures, the destruction by evaporation approaches to the efficiency to 
spalling, which took place at more low temperatures.
As is well known, two different mechanisms form waves during impact radiation. 
The first is thermal. The radiation energy transforms into oscillations of the atoms 
in crystal lattice. When the energy increases, the atoms begin to exert each other a 
stronger impact, resulting in the sequence waves of compression and tension. This 
mechanism works mainly at low temperatures (Figure 10.22a). With increasing T 
up to the evaporation temperature of the material, another mechanism is associated 
with the impact on the surface high-temperature vapors erupted of the material sur-
face. When the energy increases, the reaction of the vapors increases and the second 
mechanism suppresses the first. It can clearly be seen from Figure 10.22b–d. The 
rarefaction wave associated with the thermal mechanism is increasingly suppressed 
by the products of the evaporation. Process of the destruction in the tension wave is 
slowed down (see Figure 10.22b and c) and completely terminates at T = 25,000°C. 
Thus, the increasing of impact radiation (temperature) does not necessarily lead to 
an increase of the zones of the destruction.
Conclusions. Thus, it was shown on the basis of the unidimensional approach 
that the results of calculations based on the two different models and the numerical 
algorithms are in satisfactory agreement. This provides a hope for a certain degree 
of objectivity in the calculated results. Thus, it shows, based on numerical experi-
ments, the possibility of amplification of thermal waves in multilayer structures. The 
influence of the change in the time of action of the heat pulse from 10−6 to 10−9 ms 
on the amplitude of stress waves was studied. A significant influence of the process 
of evaporation of surface material on the dynamic destruction of near-surface layers 
is demonstrated as well. These results can be verified experimentally, which would 
allow us to judge the correctness of theoretical models that are difficult to verify 
directly.

Specifically, for example, it was objectively shown that vaporization of a sub-
stance with an impulsive energy input is basically a nonlinear process during the 
initial moments of time. Finally, despite the fact that the results calculated from the 
above two models are largely identical, the first model is more algorithmic and does 
not require additional restrictive conditions; therefore, it is more applicable.
10.4  TWO-DIMENSIONAL FRACTURE AND EVAPORATION
The destruction of a solid acted upon by an energy pulse was examined in [6,32] 
using a two-dimensional formulation. Here, we focused on studying the effect of the 
depth of energy absorption (1/L) on the character of the destruction. We will use an 
approach based on wide-range state equations of the material.

where Q0 is the heating rate, r0 is the radius of the characteristic loading area, and 
Н is the Heaviside function. In the general case, L depends on the density and tem-
perature of the material. The time of energy input τ is assumed to be small enough 
so that the processes of heat conduction and expansion of the cells cannot influence 
the energy absorption.

Thus, the expression for pρ corresponds to (1.15), whereas that for pT corresponds to 
(1.16) (see, also, Eq. (10.36)). The temperature impact pT is determined using (10.60) 
and τ. The formulation of the problem must be augmented by certain fracture crite-
rion. Here, we used the simplest criterion. We assumed that if the maximum normal 
stress in a numerical cell of the matter exceeds a certain constant value σ cr, which 
represents the strength of the matter at rupture, then a crack which is perpendicular 
to the direction of this normal stress develops instantaneously in the given cell.
The algorithm for solving the above-formulated problem is similar to that 
described in detail in Ref. [1,7,32]. Calculations were performed with the following 
parameters: R = 0.001 m, h = 0.0005 m, and r0 = 0.0006 m.
We examined three cases of loading: a) energy absorption occurs over roughly 1/3 
of the plate thickness, b) over 1/2, and c) over 2/3.
In the first case (Figure 10.23a), it can be assumed that the energy absorption 
occurs near the surface. The high-temperature vapors, that are formed, form of a 
pressure pulse acting on the unvaporized material. The compression wave which 
is formed is reflected by the tensile pulse when it reaches the free surface. A disk-
shaped fracture region is formed near the surface. With an increase in the depth 
of heating of the material (Figure 10.23b), a relatively long compression wave is 
formed, and the fracture is not formed explicitly. The calculations show that the 
volume of solid material adjacent to the free surface acquires a velocity that is nearly 
constant through its thickness. The vapors dislodge this material from the surround-
ing material, so to speak.
Further increase of the thickness of the absorbing layer leads to a situation, in 
which the mass of heated substance over the thickness of the plate begins to exceed 
the mass of unheated material. At the same time, the quantity of vaporized substance 
does not increase as in the preceding case (Figure 10.23b). The heated cells begin 
to exert pressure against the surrounding cells and fracture them. This ultimately 
results in through fracture of the plate (Figure 10.23c).
Figure 10.24 shows the dependence of the processes of the expansion of the 
 evaporated matter and plate destruction (cells noted by points) from L: L = 8000 m−1 
(a), L = 4000 m−1 (b), L = 2000 m−1 (c and d), and instants of time 0.116 × 10−6, 0.118 × 
10−6, 0.0605 × 10−6, and 0.155 × 10−6 seconds, respectively.
In the case a, the energy release can be considered as a near-surface one. The 
expansion of the high-temperature vapor leads to the formation of a pressure pulse 
on the condensed material. The resulting pressure waves, when reflected on a free 
surface, are reflected by a tensile pulse.
Near the surface appears disc-shaped area of destruction. The rates of expansion 
of evaporated matter and solid cells of the rear side of the plate in the considered 
cases reach 14,000 and 1600 m/s, respectively.
When the depth of the material’s heating is increased (see Figure 10.24b), a 
longer wave of pressure is formed. In this case, the destruction is not connected 
with the spalling away from the solid material of the plate. Cells of the rear surface 
and the zone of intensive heating acquire, according to the calculations, almost the

same speed. As a result, the pairs seem to knock out the loaded cells from the sur-
rounding material. The velocities of the cells indicated in Figure 10.24b are equal 
to 9500 and 1400 m/s. Further growth of the absorption layer leads to the fact that 
in thickness, the mass of heated material begins to exceed the mass of the unheated 
material. Together with this, the amount of evaporated substance compared to the 
previous case does not increase, and the temperature the pair does. Heated cells start 
to press on the surrounding cells and destroy them (see Figure 10.24c).
Over time, the number of the destroyed cells increases, and we have the full local 
destruction of the plate (destruction of all thickness of the plate). Note that the speed 
of the vapor cells in the case of L = 2000 m−1 increased from 3400 m/s (B) up to 
5500 m/s (г). At the same time, the speed of the rear side of the plate practically did 
not change and was equal, i.e., approximately 1500 m/s. Thus, an increase in absorb-
ing capacity of the energy of a substance causes a drop in speed expiration of vapor 
and leads to a change in the nature of destruction with a slight change in the speed of 
motion of the rear surface of the plate.
Experimental data. In general, the described destruction is similar to the 
destructions of the plates by various strikers (impactors), carrying the same energy. 
With increasing of the striker mass is broken mechanisms of knocking out the cork 
and crushing of the material. Thus, the action of the radiation energy can be simu-
lated by high-speed striker impact.
10.5  FRACTURE OF SOLID BY RADIATION PULSES AS 
A METHOD OF ENSURING SAFETY IN SPACE
To determine the optimum conditions of fracturing or altering the trajectory of dan-
gerous space objects (DSOs) (large iron or rock space bodies, threatening to collide 
with the Earth), and also destroy space debris in the space around the Earth, we pres-
ent a mathematical formulation for calculating the dynamic strength of solids under 
the action of high-energy loading pulses. The results of numerical modeling are 
compared with the experimental cupola-shaped spalling areas on the rear surface of 
a metallic plate subjected to laser radiation. The change in the fracture mechanisms 
(front and rear spallation) with increasing energy of the action has been detected. 
Recommendations are given for optimizing the pulsed laser action on DSOs to 
ensure the fragmentation of them or changing of their orbits.
10.5.1  inTroducTion
High-energy radiation sources have made it possible to develop new effective 
methods of actions on materials to change their properties and aggregate states 
[21,23,24,29]. The most accessible sources of intensive coherent electromagnetic 
irradiation are lasers. The continuous improvement of the technology of pulsed lasers 
is their increased power [46]. Now, they may be used in new unconventional areas. 
In particular, it is possible to examine the mechanical properties of various matter 
and materials under the conditions of energy, pressure, and loading rates which have 
been previously inaccessible for examinations [48–52].

283
Extreme Waves Excited by Radiation Impact
At the same time, these properties are absolutely essential in developing the new 
technologies associated with the treatment of materials under the extreme tempera-
ture and force conditions. It is very important to take into account the strength prop-
erties of materials especially for the extreme radiation pulses. In these cases, the 
energy absorption by the material and very rapid evaporation of it may lead to the 
formation of stress waves whose amplitude is sufficient for fracture.
As an important example of an unconventional use, one can mention the possibil-
ity of utilizing high-energy lasers for evaluating the resistance of meteorite screens 
of space systems [53].
One of the most promising areas of application of laser emitters is space ecology. 
It is well known that a planet may collide with DSOs which include asteroids and 
large comets [54]. Regardless of the low probability of such an event, the potential 
damage caused by it in the case of the Earth is so large that preventive protective 
measures cannot be regarded as unnecessary.
Using for the protection a rocket carrying a powerful hydrogen bomb and its 
explosion near the DSO is a very complicated problem. In addition to this, it requires 
considerable investment. To rectify these problems, an important alternative is to use 
remote emitters which produce high-energy radiation of various natures. It should be 
taken into account that the attenuation of pulses on space distances leads to the situa-
tion in which the most obvious method – the variation of the trajectory of the DSO by 
generating the reactive jet as a result of vaporization of the DSOs – is possible only 
on small space distances from the Earth.
There is a possibility of efficiently using the laser-pulsed radiation for such space 
distances where the energy of the pulse is still insufficient to the vaporization of the 
material but is already sufficient for fracture of it within surface rarefaction wave. 
This wave is formed as a result of unloading the almost instantaneously heated mate-
rial toward the side of the source of pulse radiation. With other conditions being 
equal, this effect may be applied over considerably longer distances than the effect 
whose task is to vaporize the DSOs. This greatly simplifies the method of achieving 
the given goal – to deflect sufficiently the DSO from its initial orbit along which the 
collision with the Earth may occur (Figure 10.25).
While solving the problems of laser thermonuclear synthesis, it has been indi-
cated that it is possible to select the optimum nontrivial profile of the radiation power 
causing the maximum utilization of the pulse energy for accelerating the particle of 
the material medium [53]. It is assumed that this method is carried out not by a single 
but by a series of consecutive pulses graded with respect to duration and amplitude. 
However, here we examine the effect of only single pulse.
Liquidation of “space debris” – antropogeneous objects traveling on the orbits 
close to the Earth – is another problem of space ecology. Powerful lasers can be 
used for this problem. The importance of the problem was indicated by cases of 
collision of these objects with the space stations and also with other artificial sat-
ellites of the Earth. As there are vast quantities of the space debris, they cannot 
be removed by direct collection. The only realistic method of liquidating them is 
long-range vaporization or reduction to safe dimensions followed by combustion in 
the atmosphere. However, there is a risk that the degree of fragmentation of the indi-
vidual objects will be insufficient and this will only increase the total number of the 

284
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
dangerous objects. The selection of the efficient and, at the same time, economical 
method of affecting on these satellites of the Earth requires careful analysis of frac-
ture of certain solid structures by radiation pulses.
Here, a mathematical formulation of the problem of evaporation and fracture of 
condensed elastoplastic medium loaded with a radiation pulse is presented. Wide-
range equations of state are used for a description of the thermodynamic behavior 
of matter in different aggregate states including melting, evaporation, and plasma 
formation. In addition, the model describes the dynamic failure of the material in 
tension waves by the way of the formation of microcracks.
The examined problems in the two-dimensional axisymmetric formulation were 
solved numerically using an explicit Lagrange algorithm. Comparison of the cal-
culated results with the data obtained in experiments made it possible to verify the 
numerical method used. As a result of automatic rearrangement of the numerical 
mesh all types of fracture formed in dynamics could be examined.
As the presented investigations continue, we paid particular attention to the spe-
cial features of the fracture of solids by external spallation. This type of fracture 
is regarded as a method which, if it will be sufficiently developed, could become 
a basis of a technology for the space protection of the Earth with the minimum 
losses. At the same time, a large number of calculations have been made to exam-
ine the rear spallation (free surface fracture). This phenomenon results naturally 
from presented above investigations and the general formulation of the problem. 
In particular, this may be important for solving the problem of liquidating of the 
space debris.

10.5.2  MaTheMaTical forMulaTion of The proBleM
The mathematical model of the dynamic behavior of a solid in two-dimensional axi-
symmetrical formulation is constructed on the basis of a system of equations written 
in general Lagrange formulation [55–60]. The use of three cylindrical coordinate 
systems is assumed: Euler (or spatial) with the actual configuration of the examined 
solids, initial Lagrangian (material) which coincides at the initial moment with the 
coordinates of Euler, and finally, computed Lagrangian system (also material) in 
which the regular initial calculation configuration of the examined solid, obtained 
from its real initial configuration by a means of some homeomorphous transforma-
tion is specified. The coordinates of the points in these systems are denoted (z, r, 
and ϕ) and (z, r, and ϕ), respectively. The equations of motion used in this case have

Generally speaking, described equations resemble the equations of Section 10.2. 
Some results of calculations are presented in Figure 10.26. The evolution of cold, 
thermal, and total pressures in one of the evaporated cells are shown. To provide more 
comprehensive information, the evolution is shown in relation to a monotonically

decreasing quantity, i.e., relative volume, and not in relation to time. At the initial 
moment, the thermal compression pressure forms as a result of irradiation, where 
the material is undeformed and, consequently, cold pressure is equal to zero. The 
total positive pressure causes an expansion of the material with an increasing of its 
rate. The expansion is accompanied by an increase of the cold tensile pressure which 
partially compensates the gradually decreasing thermal pressure. However, the cold 
pressure has the maximum value Pc,max at some relative volume. When the latter 
exceeds certain critical level Vmax, the cold pressure starts to decrease and the mate-
rial continues to expand without obstacles; that is, it is evaporated.
It should be mentioned that if the initial thermal pressure was lower than Pc,max, 
then the tendency for expansion of the material would be retained only up to the 
moment of reaching the relative volume at which the cold and thermal pressures are 
equal to each other. In this case, the matter would be in the state of thermal equilib-
rium characterized by the absence of stresses in the material deformed in relation to 
its initial state.
To examine the material fracture, we used the criterion of instantaneous local 
fracture (Section 10.4). It was assumed that the distribution of energy as a result of 
instantaneous absorption of the emission pulse by the plate material can be repre-
sented in the following form:
E = E f
s ( )z g( )r , 
(10.73)
where Е is the specific internal energy, which is absorbed symmetrically relatively 
in the center of the loaded spot; Es is the specific energy on the surface of the plate 
in the center of the loading spot; f ( )z  and g r( ) are functions which depend only on 
z and r, respectively.

The formulated problem is solved numerically using the explicit Lagrangian 
finite-difference schema [60].
There were two aims for calculations: the first was to verify the numerical algo-
rithms, and the second was to examine the dynamics of failure of solids by pulsed 
radiation when the absorption of energy increases. It was attempted to examine the 
possibility of changing the fracture mechanisms of DSO during its approach to the 
Earth where the power of effect on the DSO of every pulse in a series increases. 
In particular, it was attempted to examine the fracture of DSO by pulses when the 
power of every pulse in a series is increased.

(10.74)
where L is the coefficient of attenuation of radiation in the material which depends 
on the mechanical properties of the absorbed material and on the wavelength of 
radiation.
However, the calculations based on Eq. (10.74) require a highly detailed numeri-
cal mesh. It is necessary to use from seven to ten cells to describe the exponent. 
Therefore, a simplified approach was used in which the absorption of radiation along 
the depth reduces linearly.

law of attenuation of radiation in the material was not specified in the calculations 
carried out in Ref. [61], here the attenuation coefficient L value typical for all metals 
is 105 m−1.
To fulfill the first task, numerical modeling was carried out of the formation and 
development of experimentally observed [61] thin-wall cupolas on the rear side of an 
aluminum barrier under pulsed laser radiation. The typical forms of the cross sec-
tion of the specimen are shown in Figures 10.27 and 10.28. The form of the cupola

shown in Figure 10.28 corresponds to the variant of irradiation of an aluminum 
round plate constrained at the edges. The thickness of the plate was h = 0.65 mm, 
radius R = 1.0 mm. 
Formation of the cupola-like forms on the rear surface of the irradiated plates is a 
phenomenon which is utilized here, on the one hand, as a test but, on the other hand, 
presents a special subject for theoretical examination.
For the calculations, the material constants for aluminum were taken mainly from 
[44,56,48,61,62]. We will call this version of the calculations as the version C.
The number of calculation cells in the plate along the axis of symmetry was 
selected equal to 20 and in the radial directions 16.
Analysis of the formation of cupola-shaped convex areas on the rear surface of 
the irradiated plate indicates that the process consists of two stages. In the first short-
time stage (the wave stage), a disk-shaped crack forms in the vicinity of the rear 
surface of the plate. The crack separates the sheet of material from the main volume. 
The thickness of this sheet is considerably smaller than that of the plate. The sec-
ond long-time stage (conventionally referred to as the deformation) consists of the 
inertia movement of the disk-shaped sheet with its deceleration as a result of energy 

289

losses for plastic deformation. It should be mentioned that during the development of 
dynamic fracture of sheet, there is a time period characterized by simultaneous rapid 
occurrence of both wave movements and plastic deformations.
Let us examine these stages of fracture. Comparison of the spallation depth 
(0.065 mm in calculations and 0.064 mm in experiments) and of the radius of the 
disk-shaped crack (0.5 mm in calculations and 0.4 mm in experiments) indicate that 
they are in satisfactory agreement.
Figure 10.29a shows the configuration of the difference mesh 0.2 × 10−6 second 
after the start of irradiation. This moment corresponds to the initial stage of develop-
ment of the spherical cupola.
Irradiation takes place in the direction from top to bottom. The upper part of the 
figure shows a depression formed in the area of the cells in which the material evapo-
rated. As in the experiments, the thickness of the spallation cupola is heterogeneous 
along the radius.
To explain the mechanism of formation of rear crack (spallation), preceding the 
development of a spherical cupola, it is necessary to take into account the evolution 
of the stressed state in the target (see Figures 10.29b [32] and 10.31). During irradia-
tion of the top surface of the target, a disk-shaped zone of heating and compression 
forms in the vicinity of the surface. A stress wave, consisting of two halfwaves, 
propagates from this zone into the bulk of the material. The first halfwave (compres-
sion) repeats the form of the initial temperature distribution in the solid. The second 
halfwave is the tensile part of the wave. These halfwaves determine the steep of the 
stresses from the maximum compression to the maximum tension.
Thus, according to Figure 10.29, the impact of radiation can lead to the formation 
of a strong compression wave in the surface layer of the material. The interaction of 
this wave with the free surface of the target causes the development of a stretching 
wave propagating into the material behind the compression wave. The tensile stress 
may exceed the dynamic tensile strength of the material, which will cause the spall-
ing of the front layer of the target (Figure 10.29b). Over time, that layer can break up 
into fragments (drops, cavitation), and the compression wave front can reach the back 
side of the target and cause the spallation of the back surface of the target (see, also, 
Figures 10.27, 10.28 ,and 10.31(right)).

Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
However, if pulsed radiation is accompanied by intensive evaporation, the tensile 
stresses are restricted and the pulse loses its central symmetry relatively compression 
and tension. This was shown in [37] using unidimensional calculations (see Sections 
10.2 and 10.3). The same result is in two-dimensional calculations (Figure 10.30). 
The restriction and suppression of the tensile stresses takes place as a result of the 
recoil of the vapors accelerating from the top surface.
Generally speaking, during propagation of the compression wave, this wave can 
attenuate quite rapidly. However, reaching the rear surface, the wave can be reflected 
as the tensile wave with the amplitude sufficient for formation of rear spallation 
(Figure 10.30). For comparison, the dotted and dashed line 5 in Figure 10.30 shows 
the profile stresses obtained when fracture of the material was not taken into account.
The propagating flat compression wave has the form of a circle constantly nar-
rowing as a result of lateral unloading. Since the diameter of the radiation spot was 
greater than the thickness of the target, the stress state in the center of the narrowing 
circle remains to be planar. In accordance with intuitive expectation, the radius of 
the disk-shaped crack (region in which the stress remains planar) is approximately 
equal to the difference of the spot radius and the plate thickness (see, also, Figures 
10.23a and 10.24a).
10.5.4  Special feaTureS of fracTure By Spalling
The calculation results confirm the sufficiently high accuracy of the numerical meth-
ods used. Consequently, they can be used to examine the problem of controlling

fracture and optimizing it during of spallation of the DSO by laser pulses and elimi-
nation of space debris. For it is necessary to construct a quite detailed picture of 
various variants of spallation fracture for different pulse energies. Let us consider 
two variants of pulsed irradiation which gives a sufficiently detailed picture of pos-
sible fracture mechanisms if they will be studied together with the experimentally 
recorded variant (variant C, see Section 10.5.3).
We shall examine two variants of calculating irradiation of an aluminum plate 
differing only in the surface density of the energy pulse: In variant A, Q = 1.27 × 
10−2 J/m2, and in variant B, Q = 1.91 × 10−2 J/m2. The geometrical parameters of the 
calculations are as follows: R = 0.6 mm, h = 1.0 mm, and Ri = 0.6 mm. In addition, 
in comparison with variant C, we selected irradiation with a shorter wavelength, 
L = 150,000 m−1. In these calculations, the distribution of the pulse energy in the 
depth was assumed as (10.75). The number of calculation cells in the plate along the 
axis of symmetry was 10 and along the diameter 12.
Variant A. Only the disk-shaped spallation was realized in the variant. 
Figure 10.31A shows the corresponding configuration of the target at time t = 16 ns.
The mechanism of formation of tension and compression zones, causing spall-
ation at first moments, is shown in Figure 10.32 which illustrates the profiles of the 
axial stresses along the axis of symmetry of the plate (its cylindrical volume). The 
general form of the stress waves resembles that shown in Figure 10.30, but the level 
of the tensile stresses is not reduced by the recoil pulse of the jet of the vapors.
The amplitude of the tensile wave is almost equal to the amplitude of the com-
pression wave. A tensile pulse appears during the departure of the stress wave from 
the free surface. This tension may be enough to form external spallation [35] (see 
Sections 10.1.4, 10.2, and 10.3). However, the stress wave attenuates while moving 
through the material. When this wave reaches the rear surface, its amplitude does 
not reach the critical tension of the material. Thus, there is no rear spallation. Front 
spallation takes place almost without evaporation.
Variant B. Figure 10.31B shows the configuration of the cross section of the 
loaded plate at time t = 22 ns for the second variant B. Two types of spallation 
are detected in this case: rear and front. Neither of them are strictly in disk-like 
shape. The front spallation has the form of a toroidal crack. In other words, the 
material at the axis of symmetry in the vicinity of the front surface is not fractured. 
It should be mentioned that the formation of a ring spallation cannot be detected in

unidimensional calculations. Observation of this type of fracture in experiments at 
present is associated with difficulties because laboratory lasers usually have a rela-
tively long wavelength (in the vicinity of the optical range) and, correspondingly, 
relatively thin spallation sheets (of the order of tens of micrometers). In addition, the 
external spallation is formed in a relatively narrow range of the intensities.
The formation of the ring-like crack is caused by the stress state which is highly 
heterogeneous along the radius. In the vicinity of the center of the target, it is close 
to variant C as a result of extensive evaporation. External spallation does not take 
place in this case. At the periphery of the irradiation zone, the stress state is close to 
variant A. The external spallation can take place as a result of a low counter pressure 
of the vapors.
The rear spallation is not disk-shaped but rather semi-lens facing the rear side of 
the target by the convex center. This is also associated with the operation of two-
dimensional effects: distortion of the edges of the flat wave as a result of lateral 
unloading.
The mechanism of formation of the tensile and compression zones for variant B 
for the cylindrical surface having the radius 0.3 mm is shown in Figure 10.33. This 
calculation was carried out in order to show the surfaces of both spallation frac-
tures. The general form of the stress waves resembles that shown in Figure 10.32. 
The amplitude of the tensile wave is sufficient to initiate a front spallation although 
the magnitude of the tensile stresses is partially suppressed by the recoil pulse of the 
jet of the outgoing vapors. At the same time, attenuation of the wave in the material 
weakens this wave insufficiently so that rear spallation is also possible.

Extreme Waves Excited by Radiation Impact
It should be mentioned that there is no the spallation in the vicinity of the external 
surface if the initial pulse energy is lower than that in variant A.
10.5.5  efficiency of laSer fracTure
The calculations show that the mechanism of external spallation may be utilized 
quite efficiently to fracture remote objects. However, in addition to principle feasibil-
ity of such a method of fracture it is necessary to optimize the method. The unidi-
mensional calculations of pulsed irradiation of the plates, presented below, show the 
sufficient efficiency of fracture by a means of external spallation. In particular, in 
a certain range of the amplitudes the increase of the pulse energy may even reduce 
the mass of the removed material. It is due to the evaporation which suppresses the 
process of external spallation. In this calculation series, we examined only external 
spallation to apply it to the problems of the DSO failure.
Here are presented model calculations. The irradiation (instantaneous along the 
normal to the surface) of an aluminum sheet of infinite thickness coated with an 
external layer of iron 0.6 mm was examined. The physico-technical characteristics 
of the iron determined were given in Ref. [44].
Figure 10.34 shows the profiles of the stress waves and the spallation surfaces 
for four values of the radiation energy. The energy absorption was described by 
the Bouguer–Lambert law (10.44), and the surface temperature for various radiation 
variants was 260°C to 2700°C, 8000°C, and 25,000°C.
It may be seen that the mechanisms of the fracture and the vaporization of m aterial 
are competing. The growth of the radiation energy increases the pressure inside the 
cloud of the evaporating matter and the stress in the subsurface material. As a result, 
FIGURE 10.33 Profiles of stresses σ zz (GPa) along the direction of the axial coordinate at 
the distance 0.3 mm from the axis of symmetry. Cases of the external and rear spallation: 1) 
t = 5.4 ns, 2) t = 10.9 ns, 3) t = 16.3 ns, and 4) t = 21.7 ns (dashed lines are surfaces of spallation).

294
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
the frontal region of the fracture decreases until it completely disappears at a specific 
threshold level of the absorbed energy. The volume of the removed material depends 
in a highly nonlinear manner on the energy of the irradiation pulse. This is associ-
ated with the fact that the amount of energy used by the fracture is considerably 
smaller than that used for evaporating the matter. Consequently, the relation of the 
mass of the fractured matter and pulse, acquired by the remaining unfractured part 
of the solid, has a local maximum (Figure 10.34). Similar maximum in the case of 
fracture caused only by evaporation of the matter can be obtained only at consider-
ably higher radiation energies.
To confirm this, we shall compare the thickness of the evaporated zev and spall-
ated zsp material. For the four cases examined, we have the following values: A) 
zev = 0, zsp = 0, B) zev = 3 × 10−8 m, z

10−7 m, D) zev = 2.4 × 10−7 m, and zsp = 0. The change of the mechanism of fracture by 
external spallation to the mechanism of the evaporation of the material can be clearly 
seen when the energy grows. Calculations carried out using the variants B and D in

Extreme Waves Excited by Radiation Impact
Figure 10.34 show that the volume of the material removed from the surface of the 
solid may not necessarily increase with the growth the energy. This associates with 
the fact that the fracture of the material by the spallation requires a considerably 
lower energy than the evaporation. There is the high efficiency of the methods of 
removing the mass by external spallation in comparison with evaporation in a spe-
cific range of the laser energy.
10.5.6  diScuSSion and concluSion
The radiation variants (C, A, B) examined make it possible to construct an entire 
image of the change of the mechanisms of fracture with increasing energy of the 
radiation pulse.
At relatively low pulse energies, the surface evaporation is negligible. Stress 
waves are too weak to form the spallations. When some threshold value is exceeded, 
the fracture described by variant A starts to take place and the front crack can form. 
Thickness of the fractured material is proportional approximately to the coefficient 
of energy attenuation in the material. In particular, it depends on the radiation char-
acteristics and only slightly on the pulse energy.
With increasing pulse energy, the front spallation begins to be suppressed by 
the recoil pulse of the vapor and the amplitude of the resultant compression wave 
increases at the same time. If the thickness of the irradiated solid is smaller than the 
width of the irradiation spot, the compression wave extends to the rear surface. The 
rear spallation can take place if the pulse power is above certain critical value. Both 
front and rear spallation can form at a specific combination of the characteristics of 
the load and the plate. The last case is the variant B.
With a further increase of the pulse energy, the halfwave of the tensile stresses, 
formed in the vicinity of the front surface of the irradiated solid, is suppressed. In 
this case, only the rear spallation can take place. This mechanism corresponds to the 
experimental data [48,61] – variant C. A further increase of the pulse energy causes 
the separation of the resultant cupola-shaped shell and its fragmentation [48,61]. 
However, the range of the energy in which rear spallation may occur is relatively 
narrow. The range in which double spallation may be observed is even smaller. Thus, 
the numerical experiments show that the pulsed irradiation, causing the front spall-
ation, is an efficient means of influencing on the DSO. These pulses make it possible 
to affect on the DSO from large distances. It should be mentioned that the efficiency 
of the fracture is determined in the first instance not by the pulse energy but by the 
depth of its absorption. External spallation is proportional to depth of the absorption 
in the last case. In a specific range of distances to the target and the pulse energy, it is 
possible to find the best way for fracture of the DSO by external spallation and pre-
venting premature suppression of this fracture mechanism by the evaporation. The 
development of powerful lasers in the X-ray and gamma ranges and the optimization 
of radiation pulses would make it possible to obtain and optimum combination of the 
front spallation and evaporation of material of the DSO.
To liquidate space debris – especially fine debris – the best results will be 
obtained by combining external and internal spallation. In this case, the depth of 
absorption should be sufficiently small to ensure fine fragmentation of the material. 

296
Extreme Waves and Shock-Excited Processes
Combination of the two types of spallation would enable highly efficient disintegra-
tion of small fragments of technogenous origin.
CONCLUSION
	
1. Numerical modeling of the experiments with the formation of cupola-
shaped rear convex areas under laser radiation showed that the results are in 
agreement with the experimental data. The theoretical data describe rightly 
the depth and radius of the disk-shaped spallation crack observed in the 
experiment
2. A change of the mechanism of spallation fracture with increasing energy of 
the laser pulse was discovered: from the front spallation to a combination 
of front and rear spallations and then to the rear spallation only.
3. A highly two-dimensional effect of formation of the ring-shaped crack in 
the front spallation has been determined numerically.
4. We suggest to prevent the collision of the Earth with the DSO by deflect-
ing the orbit and partial fragmentation of DSOs. It is proposed, as the most 
efficient procedure, to subject them to the effect of a series of pulses of laser 
radiation causing a frontal spallation and evaporation. For the maximum 
disintegration of fine space debris, it is recommended to utilize the laser 
pulses causing front and rear spallations at the same time.

11 Melting Waves in Front 
of a Massive Perforator
The penetration and perforation of metal plates by a cylindrical steel projectile are 
examined experimentally and simulated numerically. It is shown that conical melt-
ing wave is formed beneath the projectile [63–66] (Figure 11.1).
We emphasize that Mach cones have been well known for gas-like media.
This chapter is aimed at the study of all the stages of the penetration process right 
up to complete perforation. Particular attention is paid to investigate the formation 
of melting wave beneath the projectile. The influence of the impact velocity of the 
projectile on the temperature effects connected with the plastic shear deformation, 
the penetration depth, and the character of deformation and perforation of targets of 
various materials is also studied.
11.1
EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION
  
 
Targets of two aluminum alloys, AMg6 (highly plastic) and AI-Zn-Mg (high strength) 
[63,64], were examined. The plates of the first alloy were 30 and 60 mm in thickness, 
and of the second, 30 mm. The test results are given in Figures 11.2 and 11.3.
We note that for the 30-mm plates the material failure occurs are approximately 
identical and are in the 220–240 m/s range. For the 60 mm AMg6 plate, the point of 
failure is located substantially further along the velocity scale in the 450–480 m/s 
interval.
The influence of the impact velocity on the penetration depth and the deformation 
and perforation modes was investigated. Particular attention was given to the cone 
formation in the targets, due to an increase in temperature and melting of material 
at the sites of intensive plastic shear deformations. Some results of this research are

 critical speed.

presented in Figure 11.2 for different moments of intrusion of a solid body (the pro-
jectile with a flat penetrating end) into softer material.
The deformation of the target is shown in Figure 11.2. A common feature for the 
examined alloys even for low impact velocities is the presence of zones in which 
structural changes in the material were noticed near the corners of the craters. 
FIGURE 11.2 Cross section of specimens of AMg6 (a–d) and Al-Zn-Mg (e–h) alloys 
after tests (the surfaces were polished and pickled with hydrofluoric acid): (a) v0 = 138m/s; 
(b) v0 = 224m/s; (c) v0 = 390m/s; (d) v0 = 437m/s; (e) v0 = 157m/s; (f) v0 = 240m/s; 
(g) v0 = 340m/s; (h) v0 = 440m/s [66].

Melting Waves in Front of Massive Perforator
These changes are most naturally explained by the intensive local plastic deforma-
tions of the material leading to the occurrence of adiabatic shear [63–66]. These 
zones increase dimensionally with an increase in the impact velocities, but remain 
localized in the areas, adjoining the impacting body. Here, in front of the projectile, 
a cone is finally formed of the strips that join at the axis of symmetry. With further 
increase in the velocity, this cone is particularly clearly pronounced in targets of the 
Al-Zn-Mg alloy and no longer changes its configuration.
The deformation patterns in plate sections that form during the penetration are shown. 
At velocities close to the ballistic limit (corresponding to complete perforation), the 
materials’ response is different. The Al-Zn-Mg alloy is characterized by the initiation of 
internal spallation cracks (Figure 11.2g). Conversely, in the AMg6 alloy, such cracks are 
absent for all interaction velocities. There is also a notable difference between the failure 
modes in the cases of complete perforation (Figure 11.2(d, h)). The formation of the Mach 
cone is clearly shown in photos b, f, and g. In particular, an example of the Mach cone 
and cracks ahead of it is clearly shown in Figure 11.2g, an example of a Mach cone is 
shown in Figure 11.2f, and the generation of the Mach cone is shown in Fig. 11.2b.
At the same time, Figure 11.3 shows that the plug forced out after the complete per-
foration of the AMg6 plate is separated into two parts. The first part is the cone-shaped 
crater, whose surface is smooth and shiny. Such specific failure modes can naturally 
be associated with melting of the material in the sites of intensive plastic shear defor-
mations. The second part is formed by the material taken from the crater (at the right).
It needs to be noted that in some works (see [63,64]), the initial formative stage of 
the cone of failure in various target materials was observed, whereas the separation 
of the cone from the plug with complete perforation was observed in others. Here, we 
considered the dynamics of the formation and development of such structures and 
the accompanying temperature effects in relation to the impact velocities. From our 
point of view, a comprehensive study of the complex combination of mutually inter-
acting physicomechanical processes occurring in the target material, including elas-
tic and plastic deformation, heating and melting of the materials, is possible only by 
using the method of numerical modeling based on experimental data.
FIGURE 11.3 The typical plug and cone after complete perforation of 60 mm thick alu-
minum alloy target. Melting cone surfaces are formed by intensive plastic shear defor-
mations. The projectile velocity v0 = 660m/s. Plug and cone heights are 15 and 8 mm, 
respectively [66].

NUMERICAL MODELING
  
 
The calculations in this chapter are made in accordance with the algorithm in [38]. 
The behavior of the projectile materials was assumed to be elastoplastic with ideal 
plasticity, which is defined by a hyperbolic system of laws of conservation in a dif-
ferential form supplemented with corresponding determining relationships.
The mathematical model was constructed on the basis of a hyperbolic two- 
dimensional system of the continuum mechanics equations for the asymmetrical 
case. The equations for this case include (10.61)–(10.63), the equation of state (10.36):

the equations for the deviator components (10.71) and von Mises yield condition 
(10.66).
Since it was assumed that the experimentally obtained results are connected with 
the separation of the body, it was additionally assumed that all the work of plastic 
deformation in one volume of the body or the other is converted into internal energy 
and is used up to increase the temperature of this volume. Here, since the time taken 
for plastic deformation with the given type of loading is measured in microseconds, 
the heat-transfer processes were disregarded. In other words, the plastic deformation 
was assumed to be adiabatic.
The rate of increase in temperature was determined by a formula,

where T is the temperature, Cp is the specific heat of the material, ρ0 is its initial density, 
and σ ij and εij are the components of the stress and deformation rate tensors, respec-
tively (the dot on top of the symbol signifies a time derivative along the trajectory).
Here, the increase in temperature was reckoned from the instant the plastic defor-
mation started in a particular volume of the material up to the time the melting point is 
reached in the same volume. After this, the material was considered to be in a molten 
state and was treated as a fluid in subsequent calculations (with a zero second coef-
ficient of Lame) by assuming that its temperature no longer increases. It was assumed 
that, for the AMg6 alloy, C
3 
p = 0.9 × 10 J/(kg·deg), Tm = 450°C; for the AI-Zn-Mg alloy, 
Cp = 103 J/(kg·deg), Tm = 570°C; for steel Cp = 1.1 × 103 J/(kg·deg), Tm = 1550°C, where 
Tm is the melting point. The initial temperature of the interacting bodies was 20°C.
The present work uses the boundary conditions at the surface of contact between 
the projectile and the target. A condition of total slip was set at this boundary, which 
can introduce an additional error into the calculations. An algorithm [60] has been 
used in this work to calculate the position of the contact boundaries. This algorithm 
makes it possible to account for the sliding past of the elements of the surfaces of the 
interacting bodies and their partial or total separation from one another. The algo-
rithm includes three stages at each spacing relative to the time.
The preliminary values of the velocities and coordinates of the boundary nodes 
of the calculation grid are calculated in the first stage, and here, it is assumed that for 
each body, there exists no other contacting body.

301
Melting Waves in Front of Massive Perforator
In the second stage, the nodes intersecting the boundary of another body are 
determined. The velocities of these nodes and the sections of the boundaries which 
they intersected are determined so that, as a result, the nodes coincide exactly with 
the corresponding sections of the boundaries. The magnitude of the corrected veloc-
ity here is assumed to be a set function of the velocities of the adjoining boundary 
nodes of the grid at the instant the boundary is intersected and of the stress–strain 
state of the volumes of the material that adjoin this boundary. The form of this func-
tion is determined in accordance with the law of conservation of momentum.
The location of the contact boundaries as a whole is established in the third stage 
from the local values of the corrected velocities of the nodes. The use of the above 
algorithm yielded a form of the formed crater.
11.3  RESULTS OF THE CALCULATION AND DISCUSSION
As is known, the accuracy in a numerical experiment depends on the values of the 
spacings used in the time and space coordinates.
In the case examined, the size of the cells should provide the possibility of 
obtaining, in the numerical calculations, temperatures that reach the melting point 
of the material. With a view to finding such sizes, calculations for impacts with 
168 m/s velocity were made for various variants of splitting of the area adjoining the 
front face of the projectile. In particular, cells measuring 3.8 × 3.8, 1.9 × 1.5, and 
1.0 × 0.7 mm were used. The maximum temperatures reached in the AMg6 alloy 
target in these cases were 272, 408, and 450, respectively. The increase in the maxi-
mum temperature “with condensation” of the grid was evidently due to the fact that, 
in using a coarse grid, the work of the plastic deformation is found to be distributed 
over a larger mass of the material than is actually the case, and this itself leads to 
a reduction in the calculated value of the temperature. With a finer grid, a better 
approximation of the area is obtained wherein the conversion of the work in the plas-
tic deformation to internal energy is affected. It was this particular type of grid that 
was used to obtain the results presented below.
The picture of deformation of the Lagrangian grid in the target with the passage 
of time is illustrated in Figure 11.4. The grid in the projectile is not shown in view 
of its minor deformation. It can be seen that maximum grid distortion in the target 
is concentrated close to the corner of the penetrating projectile, and, here, these 
distortions decrease more slowly only in the vicinity of the line located at ~45° to 
the leading face of the projectile in the direction of the axis of symmetry. These 
relatively large distortions of the Lagrangian grid can be associated with a sufficient 
level of confidence and with the experimentally observed bands of adiabatic shear 
(Figure 11.2).
The above situation is further confirmed in the analysis of the temperature distri-
bution in the AMg6 alloy target sections (see tables 1–3 in [64]).
The variation in the calculated temperature values in the Lagrange grid cells in 
relation to the impact velocity can be seen from tables 1–3 in [64]. For v0 = 112m/s, 
the melting point is attained in only one cell adjoining the corner of the projectile 
section. The number of such cells increases with an increase in the impact velocity, 
and these cells form the already-known band at ~45° angle to the leading face of the

projectile. The temperature gradient in the vicinity of the given band is very high. It 
should be noted that there is good agreement between the lengths of the calculated 
areas of melting and the experimentally observed structurally changed zones of the 
target material. The large width of the calculated zones is probably explained by the 
imperfection of the model used.
The temperature distribution in the AI-Zn-Mg alloy target was given in table 4 
in [64]. It is notable for its raised shear modulus and creep limit. It is not difficult 
to see that the temperature gradient in the given case is considerably higher than 
in the AMg6 alloy. This evidently qualitatively corresponds to the experimentally 
observed reduction in the width of the zones of structural changes in the AI-Zn-Mg 
alloy as compared to the AMg6 alloy. A better agreement between the calculations 
and experiments (with respect to the size of the adiabatic shear bands) could have 
been obtained in the case of the AI-Zn-Mg alloy with a condensation of the grid.
However, even with the use of the breakup, the distortions of the individual cells 
are so large (Figure 11.4) that, due to the reasons noted, it was not possible to com-
plete the calculations for the entire experimentally investigated range of velocities. 
Such calculations require further improvement of the numerical method used.
Thus, we have illustrated the possibility of the emergence in solids of waves 
similar to Mach waves in gas. It can be assumed that such a wave and melting can 
occur when a giant crack propagates along the junction of tectonic plates during 
catastrophic earthquake [65,66].
