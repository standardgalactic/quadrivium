 Introduction 
 Why You Need This Book  
 If you’re a typical electronics user, you have a PC (maybe more than one), 
a smartphone, a tablet or two, and a printer. You probably also have a 
home theater system with an HDTV, a sound bar or receiver, and a Blu-ray 
player. Add a digital camera or HD camcorder, and you have a home full 
of devices that are supposed to work nicely with each other—if you’re an 
expert.  
 If you said to yourself, “Hey, I’m no expert,” that’s OK. This book is the 
expert you’ve been looking for. I’ve spent years using, writing about, and 
learning about these technologies, and I’m here to help.  
 If you’ve ever been frustrated by long hold times for “help” that didn’t 
help much, unnecessary service calls, or problems you just can’t fix, this 
book is for you. It isn’t written for technology geniuses, but for people 
who just want their home and personal technology tools to do the jobs 
they’re supposed to—and a little bit more.  
 This is my third  PC Help Desk  book, and I’m very glad to be covering this 
topic again. When I wrote my first  PC Help Desk  book and teamed up with 
Leo Laporte for a sequel about a decade ago, the emphasis was on com-
puters (mainly desktops).  
 Things have changed a lot since then: a lot more users have laptops than 
desktops; Windows, Apple, and Android are fighting over the mobile 
device space; getting devices to play nicely with each other across oper-
ating systems and device types is essential; digital cameras, HD cam-
corders, and action camcorders are part of the action; and home theater 
systems dominate living rooms and dens in many parts of the world. This 
book is written for this diverse, exciting, and frustrating world.  
 We want to help you get your devices working properly, help you solve 
problems when they occur, and show you how to get your devices to work 
together and play together.  

Introduction

 Technology problems can be divided into three categories:  
•  Hardware problems
•  Software problems
•  Internet/networking problems
 Sometimes, a technology problem involves two or more of these areas, making the solution even 
tougher. Fortunately,  The PC and Gadget Help Desk  is designed to solve the most common prob-
lems you’ll encounter in all three areas, even if multiple problems are plaguing your system.  
 This book is designed to give you the answers you need to your computer problems—fast! Our goal 
is to take you directly from symptoms to solutions.  
 You can count on the solutions in this book. This book is the product of countless hours discover-
ing problems with home and personal electronics (sometimes even creating problems on purpose), 
discovering solutions, and testing solutions to those problems. In this process, I’ve used some of the 
latest products on the market, but I never forget that we’re all living on budgets and need help with 
devices that might not be the newest but still need to work.  
 I know what it’s like to have problems finding answers to technology questions. I’ve spent more 
than 25 years as a teacher, trainer, consultant, writer, and filmmaker on technology topics to answer 
those questions. Read this book and you get the benefits of that experience. This book is based on 
facts, not fantasy, so you can rely on it.  
 How to Use This Book  
 When you have a technology question or problem, you don’t need to stuff your brain with huge 
numbers of facts that you must to sift through to find the answers.  The PC and Gadget Help Desk 
is designed to provide you with fast access to practical solutions you can apply right away. I hope 
you’ll find it fascinating reading, but it’s really designed as a quick reference you’ll turn to when 
your computer has a problem, and one you can put aside until you have another problem or another 
question. 
 Some troubleshooting books tell you  what do to without telling you  why . Again,  The PC and Gadget 
Help Desk  is different. I love to explain why things are the way they are inside your computer, com-
miserate with you when things don’t make sense, and show you solutions that make sense. You 
deserve an explanation of technology problems and their solutions, and we make sure you get what 
you deserve.  
 Some books are designed to be read just once; again,  The PC and Gadget Help Desk  is different. 
Because of its broad and deep coverage of technology problems and solutions, you’ll turn to it as a 
valuable reference again and again to solve problems at home, at the office, or at the corporate help 
desk. 
 Here’s how to get the most from this book:  
1.  Take a look at the chapters: they’re discussed in detail later in this introduction. Go to the chap-
ter that most closely matches your general problem area. For example, if you’re having a problem

3
How This Book Is Organized
getting your PC or devices to connect with your HDTV, go to  Chapter   12 ,“Troubleshooting Home 
Theater, HDTVs, and Projectors.”  
2.  Starting with  Chapter   3 , “Troubleshooting Internet Problems,” each chapter starts with a feature
we call Fast Track to Solutions, a table of symptoms and solutions. Use this table to point you
toward underlying problems and their solutions. Start here when you need help fast. Each table
lists symptoms common to the parts of your computer or peripherals discussed in that chapter.
3.  As soon as you have located the appropriate Fast Track to Solutions symptoms table, look up the
symptom. Each symptom sends you directly to a troubleshooting flowchart or book section that
covers your problem and its solution.
4.  If you are directed to a particular book section, use the text, screen shots, and equipment pho-
tos to learn more about how your hardware and software work and to learn the troubleshooting
steps needed to solve your problem.
5.  If you are directed to a flowchart, each flowchart provides step-by-step solutions with ample
cross-references to the text that provide detailed information about the problem and how to find
the solution.
6.  Use the special elements in each chapter to find valuable tips and shortcuts, discover useful web-
sites, and avoid potential dangers.
 Here’s an example of how to use this book to solve a problem.  
1.  Assume that you can’t start your computer.  Chapter   8 covers problems with starting Windows
computers and tablets, so turn to the beginning of  Chapter   8 to get started. The Fast Track
to Solutions symptoms table at the beginning of this chapter offers a flowchart called
“Troubleshooting a System That Won’t Start.”
2.  Go to the flowchart and follow the solutions given in order. For example, in this flowchart, the
first question is, “Is your computer beeping?” If you answer Yes, follow the recommendations to
use the beep codes to find and solve the problem. If the answer is No, go to the next question.
3.  Read the recommended text sections or view the figures provided as references.
4.  Continue through the flowchart until you find the solution that matches your hardware and situa-
tion.
5.  Use the pictures and screenshots provided to help you locate and use similar features on your
system. For many problems, you will use a combination of a flowchart and particular book sec-
tions to find the right solution.

 PC, TABLET, MOBILE DEVICE, 
HOME THEATER, DIGITAL 
CAMERA, AND CAMCORDER 
ANATOMY 101  
 One Device = Many Subsystems  
 You can’t troubleshoot a technology device very well unless you under-
stand what it’s supposed to do, what connections it has on the outside, 
and what connections and components it has on the inside.  
 Whether you’re trying to solve a problem with a Windows computer, a 
home theater system, a digital camera, or a smartphone, you need to 
understand the principle of subsystems.  
 What’s a subsystem? A  subsystem is the portion of a device that does a 
particular task. For example, a smartphone or tablet’s Wi-Fi subsystem 
includes the Wi-Fi antenna, the Wi-Fi radio, and the menu settings that 
enable, disable, and configure the Wi-Fi radio to connect to a particular 
Wi-Fi source (SSID). A laptop computer’s Wi-Fi subsystem includes the 
Wi-Fi antenna, the Wi-Fi radio, driver files to enable the computer’s oper-
ating system to use the Wi-Fi hardware, and a configuration program to 
enable, disable, and configure the Wi-Fi radio.  
 When you consider that most devices covered in this book are designed 
to send and receive Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signals, store information, perform 
calculations on information, share information over a network, and output 
information to displays, speakers, or printers, you can see that even the 
“simplest” device includes several subsystems.  

PC, Tablet, Mobile Device, Home Theater, Digital Camera, and Camcorder Anatomy 101
10
 In this chapter, we’ll outline the subsystems that are found in each type of device discussed in this 
book and show you common sources of problems.  
 Hardware, Software, and Firmware  
 Each subsystem in a device covered in this book typically has at least two of the following three 
types of components:  
•  Hardware— This is the physical part of the subsystem (such as the Wi-Fi radio and antenna in
the smartphone, tablet, or PC). It has components that can be damaged or broken and repaired or
replaced.
•  Software— This is the instructions that tell the subsystem what to do. Software can be down-
loaded from the Internet, installed from a USB flash drive or CD, or can be included in a device.
Software that is built in to a chip is called firmware.
•  Firmware— Firmware is “software on a chip” that enables a device to perform functions without
the installation of additional software. Most devices have firmware, and many devices’ firmware
can be updated with improved or additional instructions so the device can perform new tasks,
work with newer types of hardware, or work more reliably.
 Desktop and Laptop PC Subsystems  
 You can’t troubleshoot a computer very well unless you understand what a computer is and how it’s 
put together. Although your “personal confuser” might look like a big (or not-so-big) box on your 
desk, it’s not really a single unit. Instead, it’s a collection of hardware subsystems:  
•  Video
•  Storage
•  Input devices
•  Printers and other output devices
•  Audio
•  Networking
•  Processor
•  Memory
•  Power
 Computer hardware can’t do a thing for you (or to you) without software. As it turns out, these sub-
systems are controlled by two types of software:  
•  A system BIOS (basic input/output system) chip on the motherboard— A BIOS chip is an exam-
ple of “software on a chip,” or firmware.

Stop ESD—Don’t Fry Your PC!

CHAPTER
•  The operating system and its device drivers— These are the files that tell Windows how to use
your PC’s hardware. In this book, we concentrate on Microsoft Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1.
 Application programs such as Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop Elements, Quicken, and innumer-
able others (we didn’t take time to count them) communicate with hardware through the operating 
system and its device drivers and the system BIOS. The end result? You create, change, store, print, 
and transmit documents, photos, videos, and other digital masterpieces.  
 There are plenty of ways the whole process can fail, and with the greater demands we place on our 
computers today, more is at stake than ever before. A few years ago, a computer failure might have 
meant that you’d lose your home budget or customer records. Now, a computer failure could also 
wipe out your digital photo collection or gigabytes of digital music files. That’s scary!  
 We’re here to help take the fright out of computer problems and help you keep your PC running. The 
first step to handling computer problems is learning what’s inside a typical computer. If you don’t 
understand your PC, troubleshooting it is just about impossible.  
 This section introduces you to the major components in typical computers, including those prone to 
being a point of failure. Think of this as an anatomy lesson, but without the formaldehyde and nasty 
smells. 
 Before you start exploring your computer, especially before you open it, be sure to protect your 
equipment from electrostatic discharge.  
 Stop ESD—Don’t Fry Your PC!  
 Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is a hidden danger to your data and your computer hardware, par-
ticularly when you open your computer to install new hardware or to troubleshoot a problem inside 
your system. ESD takes place when two items with different electrical potentials come close to each 
other or touch each other. ESD can happen even if you don’t see a spark or feel a shock, and it takes 
very little ESD to damage or destroy computer parts. About 800 volts of ESD will give you a tingle or 
shock, but it takes less than 100 volts (an amount you can’t  even feel) to ruin a CPU, a memory mod-
ule, or other computer part. Low-power construction makes these parts very vulnerable to ESD.  
 You can avoid ESD damage when you’re working inside your computer by following these tips:  
•  Use antistatic cleaning wipes to clean cases and monitors.
•  Wear cotton or other natural fibers when you work on your PC; if you’re working at home, ditch
those synthetic-soled shoes and work in your stocking feet (cotton socks, please!) to avoid gener-
ating static electricity.
 What Is a Point of Failure?  
 In the following sections, we use the term  point of failure to refer to a component or BIOS configu-
ration that could cause problems for your system. This term isn’t meant to suggest that computers 
are constantly on the verge of having a problem, but that some parts of the computer are more likely 
to cause problems than others.

•  Buy and use anti-ESD devices, such as a wrist strap with an alligator clip and an antistatic mat.
Connect the alligator clip to the computer  after you disconnect it from power; this equalizes the
electrical potential between you and the computer to prevent ESD.  Figure   1.1 shows you how a
wrist strap works to protect your PC.
•  Hold components by the case or card bracket—never by the circuit board or data/power
connector.

properly. 
 Don’t Commit These ESD Goofs  
 ESD protection is only as good as the user. To make sure a wrist strap works, take off the wristwatch 
or dangly bracelets on the wrist you want to use for the strap. Adjust the strap so the metal plate is 
snug against the inside of your wrist (so that hair won’t interfere with ESD protection). Make sure 
you snap the cable with the alligator clip to the wrist strap. Make sure you attach the alligator clip 
to a metal part of the PC’s chassis. You could use the power supply grill or the drive bay frame, as in 
 Figure  1.1 . 
 If you wear your wrist strap over your shirt, sweater, or blouse—or don’t connect it to the alligator 
clip—you’re wasting your time.

Desktop PC Anatomy

CHAPTER
 If you want to keep parts you remove from the computer safe as well as prevent ESD when you’re 
inside the PC, look for a  field service kit , which combines a grounding strap for your body with a 
grounded parts mat for the components you are removing (or installing). 
 Desktop PC Anatomy  
 Desktops aren’t as popular as laptops these days, but that’s OK. Laptops make sense for people 
who are satisfied with keeping a computer for a couple of years and then moving on to another one. 
However, if you like building things yourself, having complete control over what’s inside your PC, 
upgrading your system as leading-edge technology changes, or at least want to buy a prebuilt PC 
that has serious expansion options, desktop PCs still make sense.  
 A desktop PC is a PC that has separate display, keyboard, and drives/processor/memory compo-
nents. The drives, the processor (aka the CPU), and memory (RAM) are built into a box known as a 
case or chassis. The outside of the computer case is where you’ll find the following items:  
•  Cable connections for external peripherals, such as cable or DSL modems, printers, displays,
all-in-one units, and external drives
•  Drive bays for removable-media and optical drives
•  The power supply fan and voltage switch
•  The power switch, reset button, and signal lights
 No matter what you think the source of a computer problem might be, it pays to start with the out-
side. From systems that won’t start to speakers that are “quiet—maybe too quiet,” external ports 
and devices are worth investigating for the answers.  
 Front Views of Typical Desktop Computers  
 Most typical “desktop” computers use a tower form factor that is sometimes too bulky for your desk, 
so they’re often placed on the floor.  Figure   1.2 shows the front-mounted drives and ports found on a 
typical desktop computer built from standard components.  
 Tracking Down ESD Protection  
 Try your local computer component store for ESD protection, but if you can’t find protective devices 
locally, try these online sources: 
•  e-Mat— www.anti-staticmat.com
•  Fry’s Electronics— www.frys.com  (search for “anti-static”)
•  Radio Shack— www.radioshack.com  (search for “anti-static”)

 Today, a “desktop computer” (like the one shown in  Figure  1.2 ) is often found on the floor. Back in 
the 1980s, though, when the first IBM PCs were battling the Apple IIs for desktop dominance, a PC 
did sit on the desk. These days, the term  desktop computer usually describes computers that have 
the following features:  
•  They use standard internal components such as motherboards, processors, memory,
drives, sound cards, and video cards.
•  They are too bulky to be moved around frequently. In other words, they lack mobil-
ity, unlike a laptop or tablet.
•  They can be upgraded and rebuilt by the user without special tools.
•  They use a separate display.
•  They use separate input devices (keyboard, mouse, or other pointing device).

CHAPTER
 The case shown in  Figure   1.2   is sometimes referred to as a “full-tower” case. Typical cases in this 
category have room for eight or more internal drives (three in 5.25-inch bays and up to five or more 
in 3.5-inch bays; some of these also have one or two bays for 2.5-inch SSDs). Smaller tower cases 
have fewer drive bays and use smaller motherboards with fewer expansion slots.  
 Where Should I Put My Computer?  
 If you have a desktop PC in a tower case, you might be wondering where to put it. Traditionally, 
users placed them on the floor, but the problem is that a PC that’s on the floor can be kicked, 
bumped by the vacuum cleaner, might inhale pet hairs into its air intakes, and suffer other indig-
nities. If you don’t want your PC sitting on your desk, but don’t want it resting on the floor, get a 
computer desk with a shelf for the case, or put wheels on the bottom of the case to raise it above 
the floor. Just make sure you put it someplace where you can get to the internal drives and front-
mounted ports easily. In some cases, you might need to add extension cables to your mouse, key-
board, or video cables to enable them to reach to your system. If you have pets, make sure you can 
easily open your system every few months so a computer-grade vacuum cleaner and canned air can 
be used to remove pet hair: too much pet hair can kill your PC by causing it to overheat! Refer to 
 Figure  1.3 .

 Rear Views of Typical Desktop Computers  
 If you’re trying to fix a problem with a balky external peripheral, you need to look for the port to 
which it’s connected. Although more and more PCs have front-mounted ports, most PCs connect 
some or all external peripherals to rear-mounted ports.  
 Almost all desktop computers built since the late 1990s use a motherboard design based on the ATX 
standard. These motherboards use a port cluster, which usually places the mouse and keyboard 
ports to the left, followed by some USB ports and additional I/O or audio ports to the right, as shown 
in  Figures   1.4  and   1.5 . 
 Figure   1.4  shows the rear of a typical desktop computer before power or data cables are connected. 
 Some systems include built-in video rather than relying on video cards.  Figure   1.5 illustrates the 
rear-panel port cluster from this type of system.  
 The power supply can be located at either the top or the bottom of a typical tower-type desktop 
computer case.  Figure   1.4 illustrates a system with a bottom-mounted power supply, and  Figure   1.6 
illustrates a power supply located at the top of the case.  
 Power supplies convert high-voltage AC power into the low-voltage DC power used inside the com-
puter. Because conversions of this type create heat, the power supply has a fan to cool itself and 
also help overall system cooling. The fan is often found on the rear of the unit, as in  Figure   1.6 , but 
some use a fan that faces the inside of the PC, and a few have both types of fans.

 Although many power supplies can switch between 115-volt and 230-volt services automatically, 
some use a sliding switch for voltage selection, as shown in  Figure   1.6 .

Problems.”  
  Ports and Their Uses  
 As you can see, typical desktop computers have a lot of connections. Here’s what you use them for:  
•  Plug your PC into an AC power source with the AC power jack.
•  You can attach almost any external device (drives, all-in-one devices, printers, TV tuners,
modems, Wi-Fi adapters, mice, keyboards, and so on) into your system’s USB ports.
•  Use SuperSpeed USB ports (also known as USB 3.0 ports) for devices that support SuperSpeed
USB, such as most late-model external hard disks.
•  Connect a projector, home theater system, HDTV, or some flat-panel displays to the HDMI port to
put your laptop on the “big screen.”
•  The VGA and DVI ports support older displays and some HDTVs.
•  Use the Ethernet port to connect directly to a broadband modem or to a switch or router for easy
networking.
•  Use the IEEE-1394a port to connect to some types of external devices, including some DV cam-
corders, drives, and scanners.
•  Use the SPDIF ports to connect to home theater systems or HDTVs.
•  Use the mini-jack audio ports to connect to headphones, earbuds, or PC speakers.
  Points of Failure on the Rear of Your Computer  
 The most likely point of failure on the rear of your computer is peripheral cabling. Fortunately, most 
devices other than displays now use USB cables instead of older and bulkier types of cables, such 
as serial and parallel (see  Figure   1.8  ). Although VGA cables ( see Figure   1.7 ) are still used for many 
displays and some projectors, most late-model PCs use other types of cables.  
 Note that serial, parallel, and VGA cables all use thumbscrews. If you don’t fasten the thumbscrews 
to the connector on the computer, your cables won’t connect tightly, and this could cause intermit-
tent or complete failure of your peripherals.  
 USB 3.0 cables resemble USB 2.0 cables but have additional power and data leads; you can plug a 
USB 3.0 device into a USB 2.0 port, but it will it run at USB 2.0 speeds only. Other types of external 
cables include IEEE-1394a, HDMI and DVI (for HDTV and HD-compatible displays), RJ-45 cables 
used for Ethernet networking, SPDIF coaxial and optical cables for digital audio, and 3.5mm mini-
jack cables used for microphones, headsets, and analog speakers. Some systems also still support 
PS/2 mice and keyboards, either with separate ports or with a single combo port.  Figure   1.8 illus-
trates these cables (see   Figures   1.4 and   1.5 for the corresponding ports).  

19

CHAPTER
 Peripheral cables such as the PS/2 mouse and keyboard, audio, and newer types of cables such as 
USB and IEEE-1394a are pushed into place and are very lightweight. No thumbscrews or other lock-
ing devices are needed. However, these cables can also be pulled out of the socket easily, precisely 
because they are lightweight. You can disconnect and reconnect USB and IEEE-1394 devices while 
the power is on because they support hot swapping.  
 When you attach cables to the ports at the rear of the computer, avoid tangling them together. 
Tangled cables could cause electrical interference with each other, leading to erratic performance 
of external devices such as your printer and monitor. Also, tangled cables put extra stress on ports, 
which could cause malfunctions or port failures.  
 The power supply shown previously in  Figure   1.5 is another likely point of failure. If the three-prong 
power cable is not plugged all the way into the computer, the system might not start up at all, or it 
might shut down unexpectedly. If the voltage selector switch is not set correctly, the computer will 
not start at all, and if the power supply is set for 115V and is plugged into a 230V supply, the power 
supply and possibly other parts of the computer will be destroyed.

 Internal Components  
 You can replace almost any component in a desktop computer, including its motherboard (which 
connects the processor or CPU to all other components) and the CPU itself. It’s no surprise, then, 
that the interior of a typical desktop computer is a busy place.  
 As you have already learned, some problems that manifest themselves on the outside of the com-
puter come from problems inside the computer. If you add memory, add an internal drive, upgrade 
your processor or motherboard, or add a card to your computer, you will need to work with the inte-
rior of the computer to complete the task. The interior of a typical desktop computer is a crowded 
place, as  Figure   1.9   shows.

 Each of the devices highlighted in  Figure   1.9 , as well as the data, signal, and power cables that con-
nect these devices to the motherboard and power supply, can cause significant system problems if 
they fail.  
 In the following sections, we’ll take a closer look at the major features of typical desktop mother-
boards. 
 Expansion Slots  
 Typical desktop computers have at least two and as many as seven expansion slots to permit addi-
tional devices to be installed. On some systems, one or more slots might already be used for factory-
installed devices, such as video cards. Most computers have several PCI slots, and many also have 
one or more PCIe (PCI—Express) x16 slots for high-speed video.  Figure   1.10 compares PCIe and PCI 
slots on a typical system.  
 A few old systems have an AGP slot for high-speed video along with some PCI slots.  Figure   1.11 
compares PCI and AGP slots.

 Regardless of the type of expansion slot your add-on card uses, you need to push the card connector 
all the way into the expansion slot when you install a card, as shown in  Figure   1.12 .

 After the card is properly inserted into the expansion slot, you need to fasten the card bracket to the 
case with a screw.  
 Points of Failure Inside the Computer 
 Some of the problems you could encounter because of devices inside your computer include the 
following: 
•  Overheating— Clogged air vents (refer to  Figure   1.3 ), failure of the fans in the power supply
or case or those attached to the processor or video card can cause overheating and can lead to
component damage. The CPU fan shown in  Figure   1.9 is connected to the motherboard to obtain
power. Some case-mounted fans use a standard Molex four-wire drive power connector instead
(shown in  Figure   1.15 ).
•  Computer not starting— An improperly installed video or other add-on card (refer to  Figure   1.12 ),
processor (see  Figure   1.13 ), or memory module (see  Figure   1.14 ) can prevent the computer from
starting.

•  Multimedia failures— If the cables for front-mounted headphone and microphone jacks are not
properly attached to the corresponding cable header on the motherboard, audio hardware con-
nected to these ports will not function (see  Figure   1.15 ).
•  Switch and status light failures— The tiny cables that connect the case power switch, reset
switch, and status lights are easy to disconnect accidentally if you are working near the edges of
the motherboard ( see Figures 1.16 through 1.18  ).
•  Internal drive failures— Internal drives are typically connected to Serial ATA (SATA) headers on
the motherboard; some older systems also use Parallel ATA (PATA or ATA/IDE) headers. If the
cables are not properly attached to the headers, the drives will fail. See “Loose Drive Data and
Power Cables,” p.208, in  Chapter   8 , “Fixing Windows Devices That Can’t Start,” for examples.
•  External drive and device failures— External drives are usually connected to USB ports. If a USB
port is connected to a header cable but the header cable is installed incorrectly, a drive or any
other device connected to that port will fail (see  Figure   1.19 ).
 AC’97 Versus HDA Audio  
 Most systems are designed to support the High Definition Audio (HDA) standard originally 
developed by Intel. This standard is also called  Azalia . Some cases have two types of front-
panel audio header cables: one for HDA/Azalia and the other for the older AC’97 stan-
dard. Unless your motherboard does not support HDA/Azalia, use the HDA audio cable.

•  Battery failure— The battery (see  Figure   1.20 ) maintains the system settings that are configured
by the system BIOS. The settings are stored in a part of the computer called the CMOS (more
formally known as the  nonvolatile RAM/real-time clock , or  NVRAM/RTC ). If the battery dies (the
average life is about 2–3 years), these settings will be lost and your system cannot start.
•  BIOS chip failure— The system BIOS chip (see  Figure   1.20 ) can be destroyed by electrostatic
discharge (ESD) or lightning strikes. However, BIOS chips can also become outdated. Although

some BIOS chips are socketed, BIOS updates for both socketed and surface-mounted chips can 
be downloaded from the motherboard or system vendor’s website. Updates can improve reliabil-
ity and might add support for newer processors, memory modules, and other hardware.   
 Laptop and Netbook PC Anatomy  
 A few years ago, laptop computers were niche items used primarily by travelers, but today they out-
sell desktop computers by a wide margin. Although laptop computers use the same types of periph-
erals, operating system, and application software as desktop computers use, in addition to being 
lightweight and mobile, they differ in several ways from desktop computers:  
•  Laptop computers feature integrated keyboards, pointing devices, wireless network hardware,
and flat-panel displays.
•  Laptop keyboards tend to be smaller than desktop keyboards, and some lack integrated keypads.
•  Laptop computers can run on either rechargeable battery or AC power.

•  Keyboards feature dual-purpose function and other keys to control built-in speakers, Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth radios, and display functions.
•  Some include ExpressCard slots for adding additional ports, cellular modems, or TV tuners.
•  Most include a single hard disk and a single optical (DVD, combo Blu-ray/DVD, or rewriteable BD)
drive.
•  Some include an SSD (solid-state drive) instead of a hard disk.
•  Laptop computers have integrated pointing devices built in to their keyboards; most use a touch-
pad, but a few feature a pointing stick. (Which one is better is a matter of personal preference.)

screens and keyboards, fewer ports, and slower processors. Netbooks have largely been replaced by 
tablets with detachable keyboards.

 Some laptops, such as the Acer V5 laptop shown in  Figure   1.24 , use a proprietary dongle to provide 
VGA and Ethernet connections. By using a dongle, a laptop can use a slimmer design without losing 
connectivity. 
 Most laptop features are the same as on desktop computers, but the ExpressCard shown in  
Figure   1.21  is an exception. ExpressCard enables you to install high-speed ports, such as USB 3.0 
ports shown in  Figure   1.21 or a cellular modem, in any laptop with an ExpressCard slot.  
 Laptop Internal Features  
 If you want to add RAM to a laptop or replace its hard disk or SSD, you’ll need to open the device.

 Points of Failure on a Laptop Computer  
 Laptop computers don’t have a lot of internal wires, which means that if you add memory or replace 
a drive, there’s not much chance of causing problems.  
 As with desktop computers, external cabling can be a major point of failure on laptop computers. 
However, laptop computers also have a few unique points of failure:  
•  ExpressCard devices
•  Internal drives
•  Keyboards
•  Flat-panel display screens
 ExpressCard slots represent a potential point of failure for these reasons: 
•  If an ExpressCard is not pushed completely into the ExpressCard slot, it will not work.
•  If an ExpressCard is ejected without being stopped by using the Eject Hardware system tray
control, it could be damaged.
 Although a laptop computer’s drives are much more rugged than those found in desktop computers, 
they can be more expensive to replace if damaged. You can perform an upgrade to a hard disk or an 
optical drive without special tools on many models.  
 Keyboards on a laptop computer can be damaged by spilled drinks or by impact damage. If they 
stop working, keep in mind that keyboard modules are proprietary and vary by brand and model. 
 The biggest potential expense is the flat-panel LCD or LED/LCD display. However, the most com-
mon display failure on laptops with a fluorescent backlight display is the power inverter (refer to 
 Figure   1.27 ).

All-in-One PC Anatomy

CHAPTER
 All-in-One PC Anatomy  
 An all-in-one PC’s design is a compromise between the complete integration of a laptop computer 
and the completely modular design of a desktop computer. With an all-in-one PC, it’s easy to swap 
the mouse (or other pointing device) and keyboard if you don’t like the items supplied with your 
system, but it’s difficult to swap other components. A typical all-in-one PC looks like a large display 
with a mouse and keyboard. The “brains” of the unit are on the back side of the display. The optical 
drive, audio ports, and USB ports are accessed on the sides of the unit.  
 External Ports and Features  
 An all-in-one PC typically has a laptop-style slim optical drive, a card reader, some audio ports and 
USB ports on the sides of the display, and a rear panel with additional USB ports, an audio (speaker) 
port, a power connector, and an Ethernet port on the rear ( see Figure   1.26 ).  
 Workarounds for Laptop Component Failures  
 In the event that your laptop screen or keyboard is damaged, you can usually plug in an external 
screen or a standard USB keyboard and use your laptop on your desk.

 Internal Components  
 Because of its size, an all-in-one computer typically resembles a laptop internally.  Figure   1.27 shows 
the interior of a typical all-in-one unit after partial disassembly, rotated 180 degrees from the rear 
detail shown in  Figure   1.26 .  
 Points of Failure  
 An all-in-one computer can suffer similar failures as a laptop computer, except that it uses a desktop 
keyboard and mouse. The memory, hard disk, and optical drives used by all-in-one computers are 
similar to those used by laptop computers.  
 Windows Tablet Anatomy  
 Tablets are much simpler than either laptop PCs or desktop PCs in both external ports and features 
and in accessible internal components. Windows tablets are available in two variations:  
•  Tablets that run Windows 8/8.1— Some of these tablets are designed to use a dockable key-
board, whereas others can use a keyboard only if it connects via USB or Bluetooth. Some tablets

are full-blown laptops that convert to tablets using faster processors than the Intel ATOM used 
by most Windows 8/8.1 tablets. These tablets run the same versions of Windows 8/8.1 that desk-
top and laptop computers can use. Some older versions of these tablets were originally shipped 
with Windows 7, but can be upgraded to Windows 8/8.1.  
•  Tablets that run Windows 8/8.1 RT— These tablets use some version of the low-powered ARM
processor also used by most Android tablets. They use a special version of Windows that looks
like Windows 8/8.1 but is made especially for ARM processors. The Microsoft Surface is one
example of this type of tablet.
 External Ports and Features  
 Because tablets are designed primarily for media consumption (viewing websites, reading email, 
watching or listening to media), they typically have fewer ports than laptop computers:  
•  One USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 port
•  Micro-SD/SDHC/SDXC slot
•  Micro-HDMI port or Mini DisplayPort for HD audio/video
•  3.5mm mini-jack for stereo speakers or headphones
•  Proprietary keyboard dock or cover connector
 Figures   1.28 through 1.30  illustrate some of these ports on a typical Windows tablet, the Samsung 
ATIV-500.

 Internal Components  
 Although a Windows tablet has a CPU with integrated 3D graphics and memory (RAM), other com-
ponents differ. Instead of a hard disk, a tablet has an internal solid state drive (SSD) that might 
range in size from as little as 32GB to as much as 512GB (sizes of 128GB or less are most common).  
 Tablets include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, enabling wireless access to a variety of networks and devices.  
 However, unlike a laptop, a tablet isn’t designed as an upgradeable device. You cannot increase the 
RAM or the SSD capacity in a tablet, and a tablet lacks an optical drive (although you can connect 
one via USB).

 A tablet is designed to be rugged and durable. The major risk is screen breakage, so keeping the 
tablet in a sleeve or custom-designed case when not in use is a good idea.  
 Battery rundown can cause a tablet to fail temporarily until it is recharged. To help prevent prema-
ture battery rundown, disable unnecessary services (for example, Bluetooth can be disabled if you 
don’t use Bluetooth keyboards or exchange data via Bluetooth).  
 Preparing a Windows-Based Computer or 
Tablet for Easier Troubleshooting  
 Problems with a Windows-based computer or tablet can have three major causes:  
•  Misconfiguration of onboard hardware in the computer’s BIOS or UEFI firmware setup dialogs
•  Hardware failure
•  Problems with Windows or applications (apps, software)
 If you want to make troubleshooting startup problems a lot easier, you need to know two things:  
•  How the drives are configured
•  If Windows won’t start, what the error is
 This takes a little work on your part, but the amount of time you can save later is immense.  
 Taking Pictures of Your BIOS Settings 
 To determine how your drives are configured in the system BIOS or UEFI firmware, you need a digi-
tal camera, tablet, or smartphone that can take close-up photos of your computer screen.  
1.  Restart your computer.
2.  Press the key that starts the BIOS or UEFI firmware setup program (see  Figure   1.31 ). You might
need to press a key to open the startup menu and a second key to select how to start the computer.
3.  Navigate to the dialogs that include the drive boot order ( see Figures   1.32 and 1.33  ), the drive
configuration ( see Figure   1.34 ), and your built-in port configurations ( see Figure   1.35 ).
4.  Take pictures of the settings. Use the playback and zoom features in your digital camera to make
sure you have good photos.
5.  When you exit the setup screen, choose the option to exit without saving changes (on most sys-
tems, press the ESC key, then answer N to saving changes). Your computer will restart.

 Recovering from Firmware Settings Failure  
 If your system BIOS or UEFI firmware settings are corrupted by failure of the motherboard’s onboard 
battery or by a power surge, you will see a message at startup that the computer has reverted to 
default settings. You will need to start the BIOS or UEFI setup program, make any changes needed, 
and save those changes. Your system will probably not be able to start until you do this.  
 Most systems use a CR2032 coin-shaped lithium 3V battery (refer to  Figure   1.20 ) to maintain BIOS/
UEFI settings. Check your computer or motherboard instruction manual for the location of the bat-
tery and how to change it if it wears out.  
Option available only on motherboards
with 40-pin PATA/IDE interfaces
Leave these ports disabled unless your use serial or parallel devices 
Drives connected to ports 4 and 5 have
performance limited to PATA speeds

 Tip 
 You will get the best results with a simple camera if you set the camera for P mode and set the ISO to 400 
or 800. If you can set the aperture (f-stop) and shutter speed manually (M mode), use f/2.8 to f/4.0 for the 
aperture and about 1/125 second for the shutter speed with an ISO of 400 or 800. Adjust these settings as 
needed to get the best possible photos. Turn off your camera or device’s flash.  
 Tip 
 If you need to reset BIOS or firmware settings, select Optimized or Standard Defaults first, then make any 
additional changes manually. If your BIOS or firmware dialogs are graphical (as in  Figures   1.32 or 1.33, you 
can use your mouse or keyboard to move around the menus and select the option to save changes. If your 
BIOS or firmware dialogs are text-based ( Figures   1.34 or 1.35), use the keyboard to move around the menus 
and select the option to save changes.

 Configuring Windows to Keep STOP (Blue Screen) 
Errors Displayed  
 STOP (also called Blue Screen of Death, or BSOD) errors stop your computer in its tracks. The easiest 
way to learn how a STOP error happened is to read the error message and then research possible 
causes. Unfortunately, most Windows computers are configured to restart immediately when this 
happens. 
 Here’s how to change your computer’s configuration so that a STOP 
error does not automatically reboot the computer. These steps work 
for Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1:  
1.  Open Control Panel.
2.  Click or tap  System and Security .
3.  Click or tap  System to open the System properties sheet.
4.  Click or tap the  Advanced System Settings  link in the left pane.
5.  Click or tap the  Settings  button in the Startup and Recovery portion of the Advanced tab (see
Figure   1.36 ).
 Note 
 To learn more about STOP 
errors, see “STOP (Blue 
Screen) Errors at Startup,” 
p.203, in  Chapter   8 , “Fixing
Windows Devices That Can’t
Start.”
Click or tap to open the
Startup and Recovery dialog
This box must be cleared to prevent the system
from restarting when a STOP error takes place

6.  If the Automatically Restart box is checked, click the box to clear it.
7.  Click OK twice.
8.  Restart the computer if prompted.
 Setting Up System Protection  
 The System Protection feature in Windows is used to create restore points. A restore point is a spe-
cial file that records Windows, software, and hardware configurations as of a specified time. Restore 
points are typically created after Windows installs a critical update.  
 In Windows 7, restore points also store previous versions of files. 
 System Protection is automatically enabled for your system (C:) drive. To enable system protec-
tion for other hard disk drives or SSDs, or to change how it works, use the System Protection tab of 
System Properties.  
1.  After opening the System properties sheet in Control Panel, click or tap  System Protection  in the
left pane. The protection settings for each eligible drive are listed.
2.  To change settings for a drive, click it or tap it, and then click  Configure .
3.  With Windows 7, you can choose from three options: Restore System Settings and Previous File
Versions, Only Restore Previous Versions of Files, or Turn Off System Protection ( see Figure
 1.37 ). With Windows 8/8.1, your choices are Turn On System Protection or Disable System
Protection ( see Figure   1.38 ).
4.  When protection is enabled for a drive, you can use the  Max Usage  slider to specify the maxi-
mum amount of space to use. If Windows attempts to create a restore point that would use more
than the maximum, the oldest restore points are deleted until enough space is available.
5.  Click  Apply , then click  OK to use and save changes.
6.  Click  OK to close the  System Properties  tabbed dialog.
 Note

 Setting Up Windows Backup (Windows 7)  
 Windows 7 includes a dual-function backup process: Windows Backup and Restore can back up 
your files (Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, and so on) as well as create a complete system 
image that can be used to restore Windows and your programs to a new hard disk in case the sys-
tem crashes. With some editions of Windows 7, you can choose a network location for your backup. 
However, in this example, we’ll cover the use of an external hard disk as the location for your 
backup. 
 To start and configure Windows Backup:  
1.  Click  Start .
2.  Click Control Panel.
3.  Click Back Up Your Computer in the System and Security category. The Backup and Restore
dialog opens ( see Figure   1.39 ).
 Tip 
 If you use drives other than C: with Windows 7 for files you edit, such as household budgets, business docu-
ments, photos, and so, enable protection for previous versions of files for those drives.

 Caution 
 Although you can use your 
Windows 7 installation disc 
as an emergency disc if you 
need to restore a system 
image created with Backup 
and Restore, we recommend 
making a separate emergency 
disc. This is especially impor-
tant if you have a preinstalled 
version of Windows 7. You 
can use a recordable CD or 
DVD disc.

CHAPTER
 Setting Up File History (Windows 8/8.1) 
 Windows 8/8.1’s File History is designed to be easier and simpler to use than Windows 7’s Backup 
and Restore. File History has two goals:  
•  Easy backup of different versions of your files as you create and edit them
•  Easy selection of the file and version you want to restore if anything goes wrong
 File History copies files from your libraries, your desktop, your contacts, your favorites, and your 
offline files (files stored on your system) on OneDrive (Windows 8.1 only). File History won’t back 
up library files that are encrypted with EFS, library files on a network drive, or files stored on drives 
that don’t use the NTFS file system (such as optical drives, some external hard disk drives, or USB 
flash drives).  
 To set up and run File History, follow these steps:  
1.  Connect an external hard disk to your computer.
2.  Open Control Panel.
3.  Click or tap  Save Backup Copies of Your Files with File History . File History displays an exter-
nal drive (typically the one you connected in step 1).
4.  If you have more than one external drive, click or tap  Select Drive  to choose the drive to use for
File History.
5.  Click or tap  Turn On . File History backs up your drives ( see Figure   1.43 ).
6.  File History runs on a schedule, but you can run it again at any time by clicking  Run Now .
 Use the Advanced Settings link in the left pane of File History to adjust settings for how often to 
save files, how long to keep files, and how much disk space (offline cache) to use (see  Figure   1.44 ). 
 Note 
 To learn how to restore a file from a backup, see “Retrieving Files from a Backup (Windows 7)” p.466, in 
 Chapter   18 , “Upgrading and Troubleshooting Storage Devices.” 
 Note 
 To learn how to restore a file with File History, see “Restoring a Previous Version or Deleted File in 
Windows 8/8.1,” p.462, in  Chapter   18  , “Upgrading and Troubleshooting Storage Devices.” 
 Note 
 If you have a very large backup drive, you might want to let other users of your homegroup use it. If so, 
click Yes when prompted to recommend the drive to others in the homegroup. Click No if you expect to 
need the drive’s capacity for the computer to which it is connected.

CHAPTER
 Android Tablet and Smartphone Anatomy  
 Android tablets and smartphones run some version of Google’s Android operating system. Unlike 
Apple’s iOS devices, Android devices often include internal and external expansion options.  
 Android External Ports and Features  
 Android tablets typically feature a mini-jack audio port, a micro-USB or proprietary charging/inter-
face port, and a micro-SD card reader (refer to  Figure   1.28 ). Some also feature a mini-HDMI A/V port 
(also see  Figure   1.28 ). Speakers and front-facing and rear-facing cameras with microphones and 
speakers round out the typical feature list. Resolutions on rear-facing webcams typically range from 
3MP to 5MP.  
 External controls typically include an on/off switch, a volume control, and a HD touchscreen with a 
resolution of 720p or higher.  
 Android smartphones usually have similar features, except that virtually all of them use the now-
standard micro-USB charging and interface port, and some have rear-facing cameras with resolu-
tions exceeding 10MP.  
 Android Internal Components  
 Android tablets use low-power multicore processors. Some use low-power Intel ATOM processors 
that also support Windows, whereas others use some type of ARM-compatible processor. Storage 
capacity typically ranges from 16GB to 64GB.  
 Android smartphones use only ARM-compatible processors and typically feature storage capacity of 
8GB to 16GB.  
 Android devices, unlike their iOS counterparts, typically include removable batteries. SIM cards are 
typically removable on tablets with cellular radios (as well as all smartphones), and Wi-Fi 802.11n 
and Bluetooth 4.0 wireless networking round out communication options.  
 Points of Failure  
 Tablets and smartphones are designed to be rugged and durable. The major risk of permanent dam-
age is screen breakage, so keeping tablets in a sleeve or custom-designed case when not in use is a 
good idea. To protect a smartphone, use a custom-designed screen protector.  
 Charging cables, whether OEM or third-party, tend to be easy to damage. Keep spares on hand.  
 Battery rundown can cause a tablet or smartphone to fail temporarily until it is recharged. To help 
prevent premature battery rundown, disable unnecessary services (for example, Bluetooth can be 
disabled if you don’t use Bluetooth keyboards or exchange data via Bluetooth). On a smartphone, 
leave Wi-Fi disabled when you are not near a Wi-Fi hotspot.  
 If the battery fails or if you need to swap to a charged battery in the field, most Android devices are 
easy to open so you can replace the battery.  

PC, Tablet, Mobile Device, Home Theater, Digital Camera, and Camcorder Anatomy 101
50
 iOS Device Anatomy  
 IOS devices (iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch) share many features in common. Let’s take a closer look.  
 iOS External Ports and Features  
 The latest generation of iOS devices uses the Lightning compact data/charging port, compared to 
older versions that use the long-time iOS standard 30-pin port. Both types of cables plug into a USB 
port on a computer or charger.  
 All these devices feature front-facing HD and rear-facing multi-megapixel cameras, HD touch-
screens, volume control, rotation control, and menu buttons. Unlike Android devices, iOS devices 
don’t have expandable storage and rely exclusively on wireless (Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) connections for 
video playback.  
 Internal Components  
 IOS devices are not designed for user serviceability, so the battery 
is not interchangeable. A special tool or a bent paperclip is needed 
to remove the SIM card in case it needs to be swapped out.  
 Points of Failure  
 Tablets and smartphones are designed to be rugged and durable. 
The major risk of permanent damage is screen breakage, so keep-
ing tablets in a sleeve or custom-designed case when not in use 
is a good idea. To protect a smartphone, use a custom-designed 
screen protector.  
 Charging cables, whether Apple or third-party, tend to be easy to damage. Keep spares on hand.  
 Battery rundown can cause a tablet or smartphone to fail temporarily until it is recharged. To help 
prevent premature battery rundown, disable unnecessary services (for example, Bluetooth can be 
disabled if you don’t use Bluetooth keyboards or exchange data via Bluetooth). On a smartphone, 
leave Wi-Fi disabled when you are not near a Wi-Fi hotspot.  
 If the battery fails, you will need to have your device serviced.  
 HDTV Anatomy  
 High-definition TVs (HDTVs) display TV and video sources at 720p 
or higher resolutions (1080i, 1080p, and 4K). HDTVs typically use 
one of the following designs:  
•  Liquid crystal display with LED backlight (LCD/LED or so-called
“LED” HDTVs)
•  Liquid-crystal display with fluorescent backlight (now obsolete)
•  Plasma display
 Caution 
 If you are considering a 
refurbished iOS device, keep 
in mind that Apple replaces 
the battery as part of its 
standard refurbishing policy. 
Third-party vendors typically 
do not.  
 Note 
 The first HDTVs used CRTs, 
and some very large HDTVs 
built in 2012 used Texas 
Instruments digital light pro-
cessing (DLP) technology, but 
these display technologies are 
no longer used for HDTVs. 
DLP continues to be a popu-
lar choice for HD projectors.  

51
Projector Anatomy
1
CHAPTER
 Video Ports  
 HDTVs typically include two or more HDMI A/V ports, one VGA 
port, and some combination of Component (HD analog), S-Video, 
or Composite (standard TV and video) ports.  
 Audio Ports  
 HDTVs can receive both video and audio through HDMI ports. 
Other audio ports typically featured are S/PDIF ports for digital 
stereo signals and RCA analog stereo audio jacks.  
 Attachment Points  
 Most HDTVs can be wall mounted using one of several sizes of VESA wall mounts. VESA wall 
mounts attach to the rear of an HDTV by means of four bolts in a square or rectangular pattern. See 
the instruction manual for your HDTV and wall mount for details.  
 Points of Failure  
 The fluorescent backlight assembly used in many older HDTVs is 
a common source of failure. In the event that the backlight fails, 
be sure to check the inverter powering the backlight for failure, 
because it is more likely to fail than the backlight itself and is less 
expensive to replace. Plasma HDTVs are subject to screen burn-in, 
and you should take precautions and perform maintenance tasks as 
recommended in the instruction manual for a plasma HDTV.  
 If you use a wall mount, be sure the wall mount is securely fas-
tened to the wall using the recommended type of screws or bolts. 
Make certain the wall mount is designed for the size and weight of 
your HDTV and that the bolts used to fasten the wall mount to the 
rear of the HDTV are properly installed. If you are not sure of your 
ability to install or properly secure a wall mount, have an HDTV 
installation professional do it for you. Cable damage is also a pos-
sibility, but cables can be easily replaced.  
 Projector Anatomy  
 Projectors vary widely in features, such as ANSI lumens (the higher the better in bright light), zoom 
lens picture size and throw (the ability to fill a screen at short distances), projector bulb cost, capa-
bility to be wall or ceiling mounted, capability to run upside down, and the video and PC resolutions 
supported. Some projectors now support wireless (Wi-Fi) data sources.  
 Note 
 For photos and more infor-
mation, see “Troubleshooting 
TV and Video Inputs,” 
p.310, in  Chapter   12 ,
“Troubleshooting Home
Theater, HDTVs, and
Projectors.”
 Note 
 Officially, the VESA wall 
mount is known as the flat 
display mounting interface 
(FDMI). It is also known as 
the VESA mounting interface 
standard (MIS). Many HDTV 
vendors deviate from official 
FDMI standards, but HDTV 
wall mounts can usually be 
adjusted to match the most 
common deviations. For more 
information, see  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Flat_Display_Mounting_
Interface and its sources.

 Video and Signal Ports  
 Typical video ports on late-model projectors include the following:  
•  Composite video
•  VGA
•  HDMI
 Some projectors might include DVI digital video or S-video (analog video that is better than compos-
ite). Some projectors can be adapted to use component video.  
 Many projectors also include a USB type A port you can use to attach a thumb drive, a digital cam-
era, or a USB hard disk, and some include a USB type B port you can use as a video source. To use 
the USB type B port for video, connect the projector via USB, turn it on, and install the software pro-
vided in the projector.  
 Audio Ports  
 Projectors support stereo audio via RCA ports or an HDMI port.  Figure   1.45 illustrates typical audio 
and video ports on a late-model Epson projector.   
 Projector Controls  
 Projector controls enable the user to adjust for keystoning (a non-
square image caused by the projector not being lined up with the 
middle of the projection surface), select a video source, turn the 
projector on and off, select bulb brightness, adjust colors, temporar-
ily shut off the projector bulb, adjust focus, and adjust zoom.

CHAPTER
 Internal Components  
 Most projectors include three separate LCD light sources (one each for red, green, and blue) or a 
DLP (which uses a spinning transparent disk with alternating RGB and clear panels).  
 In either case, a single projector bulb provides the light needed to display the picture. As projector 
bulbs age, their light output drops as material from the filament is deposited inside the bulb. A cool-
ing fan helps the projector shed excess heat during operation.  
 Points of Failure  
 A projector is vulnerable to impact damage (dropping it can shatter the bulb, misalign the DLP 
wheel, or damage the LCD array), projector bulb failure, and fan failure.  
 Be sure to let the projector cool down before putting it away to avoid undue stress on the bulb and 
other internal components.

 Monitor Anatomy  
 Computer displays use the same types of liquid-crystal displays as 
HDTVs do:  
•  Liquid crystal display with LED backlight (LCD/LED or so-called
“LED” HDTVs)
•  Liquid-crystal display with fluorescent backlight (now obsolete)
 Video Ports  
 Most displays typically include one HDMI or DVI port and one VGA 
port. Use the front-panel control to select a signal source.  
 Audio Ports  
 Monitors with built-in speakers might have a stereo mini-jack port 
(used when DVI or VGA is the video source) or HDMI (supports 
both audio and video).  
 Attachment Points  
 Most LCD displays can be wall mounted or adjustable-angle desk 
mounted using the smaller sizes of VESA wall mounts. See the 
instruction manual for your monitor and wall or desk mount for 
details. 
 Points of Failure  
 The fluorescent backlight assembly used in many older monitors is a common source of failure. In 
the event that the backlight fails, be sure to check the inverter powering the backlight for failure, 
because it is more likely to fail than the backlight itself and is less expensive to replace. If you use a 
VESA desk mount, be sure the mount is securely fastened to the desk, make certain the desk mount 
is designed for the size and weight of your LCD display, and that the bolts used to fasten the desk 
mount to the rear of the monitor are  properly installed. If you’re not sure you can do this properly, 
ask a professional for help.  
 Receiver/Sound Bar Anatomy  
 Receivers provide surround audio capabilities for home theater systems. Sound bars are essentially 
simplified receivers that provide stereo audio or simulated surround sound for an HDTV.  
 Note 
 Before LCDs were common, 
most computers used CRTs, 
but these are limited in 
screen size (most are 17-inch 
diagonal measure or less), 
limited in resolution (most 
are 1280x1024 or less), very 
bulky, very heavy, used much 
more power than LCD dis-
plays, and produced much 
more heat.  
 Note 
 For more information 
about video ports, see 
“Troubleshooting 
TV and Video Inputs,” 
p.310, in  Chapter   12 ,
“Troubleshooting Home
Theater, HDTVs, and
Projectors.”

55
Digital Camera Anatomy
1
CHAPTER
 Audio and Video Ports  
 A/V receivers include multiple HDMI ports to enable devices such as cable boxes, streaming media 
boxes, HDTVs, and computers to provide HD audio and video. To 
support older devices, A/V receivers also include stereo analog 
and S/PDIF digital audio ports. A/V receivers use two-wire con-
nections to speakers and might support either two-wire passive 
subwoofers or active (powered) subwoofers that connect via RCA 
subwoofer cables. See  Figure   12.19   ( Chapter   12  ) for a typical 
example. 
 Audio receivers and sound bars include stereo analog, S/PDIF 
digital audio, and subwoofer connections. A/V and audio receiv-
ers also include AM/FM tuners and external antenna leads.  
 Points of Failure  
 Receivers and sound bars can overheat, so keeping their air vents clean is very important. When you 
place a receiver in a cabinet, make sure the unit has adequate airflow for cooling.  
 If the wrong input is selected, the device will appear to fail. Check inputs carefully and select the 
correct input for the signal type needed. If the receiver uses assignable ports and a power failure 
takes place, it might be necessary to use the receiver’s setup program again to reassign the ports to 
the desired functions.  
 Digital Camera Anatomy  
 Although compact point-and-shoot digital cameras are rapidly being replaced by smartphones and 
tablets with rear-facing cameras for casual picture-taking, cameras with long zoom lenses as well 
as digital SLR and compact system cameras with interchangeable lenses are popular with photogra-
phers. Although details vary, most cameras have the features discussed in the following sections.  
 Control Buttons and Switches  
 Press the Menu button to display options for the current shooting or viewing mode. Press the 
Playback button to view photos or videos you’ve taken on the camera’s LCD display or to transfer 
photos or videos when the camera is connected to your computer via USB. Press the Shutter button 
to take a photo or to shoot video. Press the zoom (W & T) buttons to shoot a wider view or get closer 
to your subject. While viewing a photo or video you don’t want to keep, press the Delete (Trash 
Can) button to discard it. Use the shooting mode  selector switch to choose between photos and vid-
eos. Use the Flash button to enable/disable/select flash modes.  
 Digital SLR and other cameras that support user-selected settings will also have a control dial 
with options for shooting in full automatic, scene, or creative modes where you control some or all 
settings. These types of cameras have buttons or menu options for ISO (light sensitivity), EV/AV 
adjustment (overriding normal exposure), and white balance (adjusts for light that’s bluer or redder 
than normal daylight).

 External Features  
 All digital cameras have an LCD display that is used for selecting shooting and setup options. The 
LCD display on some cameras swivels for easier shooting at a greater number of angles.  
 A cover protects the USB port, AV port, and connections for remote control devices available for 
some cameras.  
 Any digital camera that can shoot video also includes a microphone port for recording audio, and 
some also support add-on microphones.  
 Digital SLRs and some other cameras have a hot shoe designed for electronic flash units. A  hot shoe 
has contacts that control the functions of the flash, such as a zooming head or automatic exposure.

 Interchangeable Components  
 Digital SLR and compact system cameras have several interchangeable components and accessories. 
These include the following:  
•  Lenses— Replace lenses with zoom lenses that provide a wider field of view or longer reach than
the “kit” lens included with the camera, or add a prime (nonzoom) lens for better performance in
dim light. See  Figure   1.49 .
•  Add-on electronic flash— Use the hot shoe at the top of the camera for more powerful flash units
with tilt-swivel heads ( see Figure   1.50 ).
•  Microphones—    Many cameras in these categories can use external microphones for better audio
quality when recording video.

CHAPTER
 Internal Components  
 Digital SLR cameras such as the one shown in  Figure   1.49  feature mirrors that reflect the light coming 
through the lens into a five-sided prism (pentaprism) that the photographer uses to frame the photo. 
Compact system cameras use electronic viewfinders or the LCD display at the back for this task.  
 All digital cameras have image sensors at the back of the device and in line with the lens. Image 
sensors are rated in megapixels (MP), which refers to the number of individual dots in the image 
recorded to the camera’s memory card or other storage. The size of the image sensor has a direct 
effect on the camera’s ability to shoot in low light. Generally, full-
frame digital SLR cameras (those with a sensor size the same as a 
35mm film frame) produce the least amount of image noise (false 
color dots) when shooting in low light, followed by digital SLR 
cameras with APS sensors, compact system cameras, and point-
and-shoot cameras.  
 Almost all digital cameras of all types use memory cards, most 
often from the Secure Digital (SD) family.  
 Points of Failure  
 Digital cameras can have numerous points of failure. Dirt on lenses causes poor-quality shooting. 
LCD screen and lenses can be scratched. Impact damage can throw a lens out of alignment, requir-
ing a trip to the repair shop. Unless a camera is water sealed, you 
should avoid shooting in damp or rainy conditions. Dirt and dust 
in a camera with a retractable lens or lens cover can cause the 
lens to get stuck in the open or closed position.  
 A digital camera is a useless paperweight without working bat-
teries. However, don’t store batteries in a camera that will not be 
used over a long time, because they might leak or corrode and 
ruin your camera.  
 When you change lenses, turn off your camera, be sure to use 
front and rear lens caps on lenses not attached to the camera, and 
avoid swapping lenses in dirty or dusty environments because 
the image sensor can become dirty.  
 Camcorder Anatomy  
 Camcorders no longer use videotape for storage. Instead, they use built-in or add-on flash memory. 
Although camcorders vary widely in price and features, most have at least some of the features cov-
ered in this section.

 Control Buttons  
 Most camcorders, except for so-called “action” or “sports” models, have motorized zoom lenses. 
Some also have a custom control button in addition to the normal on/off button and snapshot (still 
photo) button.  
 Other buttons found on some models are used to switch the LCD display between shooting and 
playback modes, switching between battery information and live display, and shooting short videos 
(sometimes known as video snapshots).  
 External Features  
 Camcorders typically feature a fixed or adjustable-angle LCD display for composing the scene, view-
ing video after shooting, and for configuring the camcorder.  
 Some low-cost camcorders use AA batteries, but most camcorders use proprietary rechargeable bat-
teries. Some models can use both standard- and high-capacity batteries for longer shooting times.

 Connection and Add-ons  
 Older DV camcorders used the FireWire (IEEE-1394) port for video transfer. However, today’s HD 
camcorders connect via USB. For direct playback to an HDTV, look for models that have an HDMI or 
DisplayPort connection (usually of a reduced size). Some also have proprietary headers for compo-
nent HD video as well as a standard mini-jack for stereo audio.  
 Camcorders with a mini advanced shoe can use add-ons such as microphones and movie lights to 
help improve audio and video quality.  
 Points of Failure  
 HD camcorders are vulnerable to the same types of threats as digital cameras: dust, dirt, impact 
damage, scratches to lens or LCD display, weak batteries, and battery corrosion and leakage.

 UPGRADE, REPAIR, OR 
REPLACE?  
 The 50% Rule  
 Sooner or later, you will have a personal technology failure. It could be a 
digital camera that takes a bath, a smartphone that gets stepped on, or a 
tablet that gets dropped. But whatever it is, you’re going to ask yourself, 
“What do I do now? Should I repair it or replace it?”  
 Enter the 50% rule. It’s pretty simple: if it costs more than 50% of a com-
parable new item to repair your existing device, it’s time to send it to the 
electronics recyclers and get a new (or refurbished) one.  
 Here’s why:  
•  If you repair your existing item, you’re locked into the technology it
includes. Newer computers feature more and faster USB ports you
can use for almost all upgrades; newer smartphones and tablets have
bigger, sharper screens; newer receivers support streaming media ser-
vices, and so on. However, if you replace your existing device, you can
move your personal tech into the future.
•  If you repair one problem with your existing item, another problem
could happen later. This is more of an issue with complex devices,
especially those with multiple replaceable components, such as lap-
top and desktop computers, digital cameras, HDTVs, and receivers.
Devices such as smartphones and tablets typically feature single-board,
system-on-a-chip (SoC) construction: replace the main board, and
you’ve replaced everything.
•  Although most desktop and laptop computers have upgradeable
memory (RAM) and hard disk or SSD (storage), upgrading memory

Upgrade, Repair, or Replace?
64
and storage can sometimes cost more than half of what a new computer would cost. I typically 
upgrade the RAM and hard disk in my computers (these are easy upgrades to perform and I do 
them myself). The costs for these components are relatively low when new parts use the same 
technology as the parts in my computer. However, if you wanted to upgrade a computer that 
uses an older memory technology (DDR2, for example, compared with today’s DDR3), you would 
pay  much more per GB.  
 Applying the Rule  
 Here’s how it works:  
 You have a $700 digital SLR camera you purchased two years ago. It needs major repair to the tune 
of $350. However, a camera with comparable features now costs only $500. It makes more sense to 
replace your old camera because the 50% rule recommends that you pay no more than $250 for a 
repair. If you choose a camera of the same brand, most of your accessories (except for spare batter-
ies) will probably work with the new camera.  
 You have a $600 (actual noncontract price) smartphone that you purchased a year ago. You pur-
chased insurance for it in case of damage, but you must pay a $200 deductible. If it is damaged, 
unless you can buy the same model for less than $200 new or refurbished, get it repaired and pay 
the $200 deductible.  
 You have a two-year-old $500 laptop that needs a new hard disk and more RAM. You want to 
install a 1TB drive and 16GB of RAM. As of mid-2014, you’d probably pay about $200–220 for those 
upgrades (if you can do the work yourself). The price of the parts is less than 50% of the original 
cost of your computer.  
 However, if you cannot install these upgrades yourself, you will need to include the cost of labor. 
For example, Best Buy’s Geek Squad would charge $200 for installation of these upgrades and data 
transfer from the old drive to the new drive. Thus, the total price of these upgrades would exceed 
$400 in parts and labor, which is well above the 50% threshold for considering a replacement. 
Before you decide to replace your computer, check the cost of a new laptop with this amount of 
drive capacity and RAM.  
 Here are some other factors to consider if you are considering buying a replacement computer:  
•  Can you reuse your existing software on your new computer? If you are moving from Windows 7
to Windows 8.1, for example, much but not necessarily all of your software is likely to be compat-
ible. However, you must determine whether your software can be legally transferred to another
computer. If you must replace it, be sure to factor in the cost as you calculate the 50% rule.
•  If you can transfer an app or program, be sure to factor in the time necessary to deactivate it and
uninstall it from the old computer, install it and reactivate it on the new computer.
•  If you are not comfortable transferring data files from your old computer yourself or with the
assistance of a transfer program, expect to pay about $100 for a technician to do it for you.
•  Finally, consider the cost of your time. Time is money, and you might prefer to pay a technician
to do these tasks rather than take your own time to learn how to perform these transfers and do
them yourself.

 So, now that we have a clearer picture of the total cost of a computer upgrade, let’s run the numbers

 Assuming the processor speed and other features of the existing laptop are suitable, either upgrad-
ing it yourself or having a tech upgrade the unit will be considerably cheaper than buying a new 
laptop. 
 The older an item gets, the less sense it makes to pay for a repair or component upgrades, espe-
cially as the price approaches or exceeds 50% replacement cost. A replacement item might offer 
more features, faster performance, larger screen size, and so on.  
 Note 
 As an alternative to manually transferring programs and data, consider using one of the PCMover programs 
available from LapLink ( www.laplink.com/index.php ). PCMover transfers programs and settings from your 
old computer to your new computer, and free technical support is included. The time savings when using 
PCMover compared with manual transfers is considerable.  
 Note 
 One way to make replacing an existing unit more attractive to your wallet is to look for factory-refurbished 
or factory-reconditioned items. Many electronics vendors offer these through their own online outlet stores, 
major online retailers, and some big-box electronics or office-supply stores.  
 Some have the same warranty as new, and others might have a shorter warranty or no warranty at all. 
Check recent reviews for the seller and the product, but skip units that don’t have any warranty. Full 
disclosure: I’ve been buying factory-refurbished products for years from several major vendors and have 
always been satisfied.  

Upgrade, Repair, or Replace?
66
 Exceptions 
 The main reason to spend more than 50% of replacement cost on a repair or upgrade is if you can-
not find a suitable replacement for an item. Whether for compatibility reasons, user interface, screen 
size, or some other reason—it doesn’t matter. If you prefer to stay with your current device, it’s your 
money. 
 OEM Versus Third-Party Components  
 If you need to buy replacement parts for a laptop or desktop computer, a tablet, a smartphone, or a 
digital camera, you have two choices:  
•  Original equipment manufacturer (OEM)
•  Third-party replacements
 From chargers to cables, from batteries to drives and lenses, you can choose from items from the 
original product vendor or items from other suppliers. Which should you choose? Let’s look at the 
benefits of each approach.  
 When to Use OEM Repair/Replacement Parts  
 OEM repair/replacement parts are going to work with your device. Period. They aren’t designed to 
work with any other brand or type of product, they fully support your device, and they have a war-
ranty from the same company that supplied your device.  
 If you value reliability, single sourcing, and warranty coverage above price, stick with OEM. This is 
particularly the case if you need to replace a computer motherboard on a system with a preinstalled 
version of Windows. Although you could install a third-party motherboard (depending on the chas-
sis and power supply used in the original system), only the same model motherboard from the OEM 
supplier will work with a preinstalled version of Windows.  
 Benefits of Third-Party Repair/Replacement Parts  
 The number one reason to use third-party repair/replacement parts is money—saving money, that is. 
You can save up to 50% or more by buying replacement chargers, batteries, lenses, and other repair/
replacement parts for your electronics device from third-party vendors.  
 The second reason to use third-party repair/replacement parts is to get more features. For example, 
if you buy an OEM charger for your laptop, it might work only on the model you bought, or possibly 
a narrow range of models from the same vendor. Buy a universal model and you might pay about 
the same price (or less), but you can use it with many brands and models. Some include a USB 
charging port for a smartphone or tablet.  
 The third reason is that many OEM parts, such as memory modules and hard disk drives, are actu-
ally sourced from third-party vendors. By using a memory vendor’s compatibility database, you can 
find memory that will fit your computer, often for less than your system vendor changes.  

67
OEM Versus Third-Party Components
2
CHAPTER
 Finding the Best Values in Third-Party Components  
 Some third-party products are terrific, others are merely adequate, and a few are truly terrible. To 
find the winners and avoid the losers, check online reviews carefully. Look for products from major 
third-party accessory vendors, and when you read reviews, I recommend that you look not only at 
the so-called “most helpful” reviews, but sort reviews so that the newest reviews appear first.  
 Why? If recent reviews for a product are better than older reviews, this might indicate that the prod-
uct has been improved. However, if older reviews are better than newer reviews, product quality 
might have slipped.  
 How can you avoid fake reviews? Reviews that are mostly emotion based (“Loved it! Hated it!”) 
aren’t useful and are easy to fake. Look for reviews that emphasize details and look also at the 
reviewers themselves to help sort out honest reviews from those that are simply pushing the 
product. 
 You can help other users find the best products by posting reviews yourself.

 Speeding Up a Slow Wireless Network  
 Does your wireless (Wi-Fi) network have a bad case of the slows? Have you replaced an aging 
Wireless-G, Wireless-A, or Wireless-B router with a brand-new Wireless-N or Wireless-AC router, 
only to discover little or no change in performance? Here are the keys to boosting performance (and 
improving security, too):  
•  Choose an uncluttered channel.
•  Encryption matters, both for security and for speed.

CHAPTER
•  Wireless-N loves WPA2 encryption.
•  WEP and WPA are old; it’s time for an upgrade.
•  Some Wireless-N devices are faster than others.
•  Old laptop, new router—how to boost your connection speed.
 Let’s take a closer look at each of these.  
 Choosing an Uncluttered Channel  
 If you are using Wireless-G or standard Wireless-N networking, the 
2.4GHz frequency band these networks use is a busy one: you’re competing with other wireless 
networks in your area, some types of wireless phones, and older versions of Bluetooth (a wireless 
network used for smartphone headsets and other very short-range wireless connections). 
 To make matters worse, although 2.4GHz wireless has 11 channels, most of them have significant 
overlap. The only three that have minimal overlap are channel 1, channel 6, and channel 11. If you 
use a wireless channel that is already in use nearby, your effective range and signal strength are 
lower than they should be, and so is your network performance.  
 Fortunately, you don’t need to knock on doors to ask your neighbors the intimate details of their 
wireless networks. Instead, you can see this information in real time. The InSSIDer Wi-Fi diagnostic 
utility ( www.inssider.com ) from MetaGeek provides an easy-to-use view of both 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz 
wireless networks in your area. Although InSSIDer is now a commercial product as of version 4 
($19.95), free downloads of the previous 3.x version are still available from some download sites, 
such as MajorGeeks ( www.majorgeeks.com ) and Softpedia ( www.softpedia.com ). 
 Use InSSIDer to see which channels are in use (it also advises which channel to switch to if your 
current choice is too crowded), which networks are secured, and which are unencrypted (“open”). 
See  Figure   3.1  for a typical example in a residential neighborhood.  
 In this example, channel 36 is recommended over the current channel in use (channels 149+153).  
 To change the channel used by your wireless network:  
1.  Log in to your router.
2.  Navigate to the Wireless Configuration dialog.
3.  Select a different channel (when using 2.4GHz networking, channels 1, 6, and 11 have less inter-
ference than others).
4.  Save your changes and exit the router configuration dialog.
 Note 
 Some broadband modems 
also include a wireless router. 
Whether your router is sepa-
rate from your broadband 
modem or they are a single 
unit, the issues discussed in 
this chapter are the same.

 Note 
 Some routers use Auto as the default channel setting, as in  Figure   3.2 . The router changes the channel 
according to the settings of nearby routers. If you are satisfied with your network’s performance, leave 
the setting as is. However, if InSSIDer recommends a different channel that is not in use (or is not used as 
much), manually select the recommended channel.

CHAPTER
 Understanding Encryption  
 An unsecured home or office network is an invitation to data thieves and other assorted criminals 
to “borrow” your network, steal or distribute illicit information, and leave you facing charges when 
they disappear. Your home or office network needs to be secure.  
 There are three standards for Wi-Fi encryption:  
•  WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) is the newest and most powerful encryption method. It’s
designed to give your wireless network maximum protection. As you’ll see later, it’s also impor-
tant to wireless network performance.
•  WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is an older, weaker version that should be used only if WPA2
is not supported by your devices (for example, if you are still using Wireless-B and Wireless-G
devices that don’t support WPA2).

with Wireless-N or AC clients and

•  WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), the original wireless network encryption standard, is so weak
it’s practically worthless. It’s easily broken.
 To prevent the possibilities of use by unauthorized people, wireless networks should be secured 
with the strongest available encryption and a hard-to-hack encryption key.  
  Aliases for WPA and WPA2 Encryption 
 One of the problems with setting up WPA2 encryption on your router and devices is that both types 
are sometimes referred to as WPA. In those cases, the encryption type listed is the key to knowing 
which is which:  
•  WPA/TKIP=WPA
•  WPA/AES=WPA2
 Wireless-N or Wireless-AC+WPA2 Encryption—Speed 
and Better Security  
 Almost every wireless router on the market today supports 802.11n or its successor, 802.11ac. As 
 Table   3.2  indicates, Wireless-N and Wireless-AC can run much more quickly than their predecessors.

Speeding Up a Slow Wireless Network

CHAPTER
 Because all laptops and tablets now include Wireless-N support, it looks as if you can give a big 
boost to your network by retiring your old Wireless-G router and replacing it with a Wireless-N or, 
even better, a Wireless-AC router.  
 However, if you replaced an old Wireless-G router with a Wireless-N or Wireless-AC router but 
didn’t see any speed improvements, here’s why: Wireless-N and Wireless-AC can run at speeds 
faster than Wireless-G and Wireless-A if,  and only if , you use WPA2 encryption (or no encryption at 
all) on your network. Wireless-N and Wireless-AC require the use of WPA2 encryption. If you use 
older encryption standards, your network runs as if it’s a Wireless-G network.  
 Why WEP and WPA’s Time Is Over  
 At this time, Wireless-N routers and devices dominate, and Wireless-AC is coming up fast. But 
because a lot of older devices are still connecting to those routers, you might have a mixture of 
Wireless-N or Wireless-AC and older-standard devices on your wireless network. If that sounds like 
your wireless network, you may have two challenges:  
•  Getting maximum performance
•  Protecting your wireless network
 As you’ve already learned, WPA2 encryption is the secret to maximum 802.11n and 802.11ac per-
formance and maximum safety. However, what are your alternatives if you suspect (or know) that 
some of your hardware doesn’t support WPA2 encryption? Here’s what you can do:  
•  Install driver or firmware upgrades to enable existing devices to use WPA2 encryption. This is
the least expensive route to take  if your devices can be upgraded.
•  Downgrade the security of your network to a lower stan-
dard supported by all of your devices. If you’re still using a
Wireless-G router, this is acceptable. However, if you configure
a Wireless-N or Wireless-AC router to use WPA or WEP encryp-
tion, it runs at Wireless-G speeds only. That means you lose out
on most of your potential network speed.
•  Drop encryption completely. Use this option, and you might as
well put a welcome mat on your router, inviting data thieves,
media pirates, pornographers, and spies to use your wireless
connection. Law enforcement and digital media rights enforce-
ment can trace illicit traffic back to your router, so you’ll be
blamed for any misdeeds performed using your Internet connec-
tion.
•  Replace devices or adapters that don’t support WPA2 wireless
networking with newer, compatible devices that do. If you have
a lot of older hardware around, this could cost some bucks, but it makes your network faster and
more secure.
•  Set up two separate wireless networks: one with WPA2 support for maximum security and the
other with weaker security for older devices.
 Tip 
 To help support older types 
of wireless hardware that 
don’t support WPA2, some 
routers (refer to  Figure   3.2 ) 
support WPA/WPA2 encryp-
tion. This setting uses WPA 
encryption on devices that 
don’t support WPA2 and uses 
WPA2 encryption on devices 
that support it. This provides 
better security than using 
WPA only, but it can slow 
down your network.  

Troubleshooting Internet Problems

 However, even if you upgrade or replace older devices with devices that support WPA2 encryption, 
you might still be disappointed with the performance of your network.  
 Why Some Wireless-N and AC Devices Run Faster Than 
Others 
 Although Wireless-N and Wireless-AC networks support the same 2.4GHz frequencies as Wireless-B 
and Wireless-G (and many Wireless-N routers and some adapters and all Wireless-AC devices also 
support the 5.0GHz frequencies used by Wireless-A), devices on these networks can vary widely in 
performance. Why?  
 Unlike its predecessors, Wireless-N is designed to support multiple data streams with multiple send-
and-receive antennas and two different channel widths (20MHz, as with older Wi-Fi standards, and 
40MHz). Wireless-AC also supports multiple data streams with even wider (and faster) 80MHz and 
160MHz channels.  
 Although Wireless-N is capable of providing as much as 150Mbps per data stream, that assumes the 
use of wide (40MHz) channels and short transmission times. In reality, you’ll probably get about half 
that speed, especially if your devices and router support only 2.4GHz signaling.  
 Wireless-AC’s big speed improvements are based on using the wider 80MHz and 160MHz channels 
that are available only if you use Wireless-AC routers and adapters; if a Wireless-AC router is con-
necting to Wireless-N 5.0GHz adapters, or vice versa, the connection acts like a Wireless-N connec-
tion. If you have a mixture of device speeds, the speed of the slower device determines the speed of 
the connection.  
 Another factor that has a big impact on Wireless-N and AC speeds is the number of antennas sup-
ported by the router and the adapters (either built-in or add-on devices). This is typically expressed 
in this way:  
•  1x1—one transmit, one receive antenna
•  2x2—two transmit, two receive antennas
•  2x3—two transmit, three receive antennas
•  3x2—three transmit, two receive antennas
•  3x3—three transmit, three receive antennas
 The number of transmit antennas generally corresponds to the number of spatial streams (data 
streams) the device can support. In the case of a router that supports both 2.4GHz and 5GHz sig-
nals, the specifications include this information for each band.  
 Note 
 When a device has a different number of receiving and sending antennas, the device might be identified by 
the number of spatial (data) streams it can send and receive. For example, a device with a 2x3 antenna con-
figuration can also be identified as having a 2x3:2 configuration (two send antennas, three receive anten-
nas, two spatial [data] streams send/receive support). Some smartphones and tablets simply use the term 
MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) if they support two or more wireless N streams.  

77

CHAPTER
 It can be difficult to determine exactly what the antenna and stream support is on some devices. 
Fortunately, almost all Wireless-N and Wireless-AC routers and devices identify their performance 
potential by their class designation.  
 For example, a Wireless-N device with N150 performance has a maximum link rate of 150Mbps and 
supports only the 2.4GHz band. A Wireless-N device with N600 performance has a maximum link 
rate of 300Mbps for 2.4GHz and 300Mbps for 5.0GHz (300+300=600).  
 A Wireless-AC device with AC750 performance has a 300Mbps 
maximum link rate for 2.4GHz and 433Mbps for 5.0GHz, whereas an 
AC1900 model has a 600Mbps link rate for 2.4GHz and 1300Mbps 
link rate for 5.0GHz.  
 To achieve maximum speed and maximum flexibility for your 
network: 
•  Choose a router that supports 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz frequencies.
•  Configure your router to use WPA2 encryption.
•  Use the fastest available dual-band Wireless-N or Wireless-AC wireless adapters.
 Old Computer, New Router? Boosting Wi-Fi Speed  
 If you have a laptop or desktop computer with a Wireless-G adapter or a simple 1x1 (150Mbps) 
Wireless-N adapter and a Wireless-N router rated for higher speeds, you can improve your wireless 
connection speed by upgrading to a better Wireless-N adapter or a Wireless-AC adapter. Here’s a 
case in point:  
 My HP Pavilion DV6-series laptop has a Broadcom 4313GN 802.11bgn wireless adapter, as shown in 
Device Manager (see  Figure   3.3 ). It connects to an N900 router, but it has a connection speed of only 
72Mbps. Multiply this value by 2 to get the rating (144Mbps rounds up to N150).  
 I connected a Netgear N600 adapter to my laptop’s USB port after installing its drivers. Then I dis-
abled the onboard wireless adapter:  
 To disable the onboard adapter, follow these steps:  
1.  Open Device Manager.
2.  Expand the Network Adapters listing.
3.  Right-click the existing adapter.
4.  Select  Disable from the right-click menu.
5.  Click  Yes to disable it.
 (To enable it, follow steps 1–3, and then select  Enable  in step 4 and confirm this choice.)  
 After I connected to my router using the 2.4GHz channel, the connection status of the new adapter 
shows twice the speed of the old adapter. The best speed, though, was achieved when I connected 
to the 5GHz channel in which I achieved a speed that was more than 3.3 times faster than with the 
original adapter (see  Figure   3.4 ). Multiply the speed shown by 2x to determine the rating.

 The faster speeds made an obvious difference when using streaming video from services such as 
Netflix or YouTube and when transferring files between computers on the home network.  
 Dealing with Slow, Insecure Devices on Your Home 
Network  
 Network security is only as strong as its weakest link. Because wireless networking has been 
around for more than 10 years, you might have a wide range of devices on your wireless network, 
and some of them won’t support WPA2–the strongest Wi-Fi encryption and the one that’s neces-
sary to get maximum speed from Wireless-N and Wireless-AC routers and devices. The most likely 
offenders include the following:  
•  Early Wireless-G (802.11g) routers or network adapters
•  Older portable game systems
 It’s easy to replace old routers and network adapters, including those that connect to games. For 
example, the original Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Network Adapter supported Wireless a/b/g. You 
can replace it with the Xbox 360 Wireless N Network Adapter.  
 However, older portable game systems can be more difficult to replace. For example, although 
Nintendo’s current crop of portable systems (2DS, 3DS, and 3DS XL) use WPA2 encryption, they sup-
port DS online games that work only with WEP encryption. If you’re still playing online DS games, 
you can’t change encryption types.  
 To keep the gamers in the family happy, you can use one of these alternatives: Guest mode or 
weaker encryption for older devices.  
  Using Guest Mode  
 If your wireless router supports a Guest mode, you can use it to provide devices that can’t support 
the newest security settings (or don’t use security at all) an Internet connection without reducing 
the security settings used by newer devices on your network. It’s also handy for letting friends 
and family get on your network safely: Guest mode prevents access to network printers or shares. 
Depending on the router, Guest mode might be available for only 2.4GHz channels or for both 2.4 
and 5.0GHz channels. Although it does not use encryption, it requires that users open their brows-
ers and enter  the password you provide during setup.  Figure   3.5 illustrates a router configuration 
screen for Guest mode. If Security mode is enabled, this dialog also prompts the user to set up a 
password (encryption key).   

Troubleshooting Internet Problems
80
  2.4GHz for Older Devices  
 If your router doesn’t support Guest mode, configure the 2.4GHz channel in your router to use WEP 
encryption for devices that must use this encryption type, and use the 5GHz frequency with WPA2 
encryption for PCs, tablets, portable game systems, and smartphones that support this encryp-
tion type and frequency. To make this strategy work, upgrade to dual-band Wireless-N or any 
Wireless-AC adapters and routers.  
 Setting Up a Secure Wireless Network  
 If you read the preceding sections of this chapter and nodded along, saying, “Guess I’d better 
secure my network,” or are preparing to set up a brand-new wireless network, these tips are for 
you. 
 Your first challenge is how to set up a secure network. You typically have two choices: 
•  Select and enter encryption keys manually.
•  Use Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS).

CHAPTER
 Encryption Keys Problems and Solutions  
 With WPA2 (preferred) or WPA encryption, you have three options when you configure your router 
and your network devices:  
•  You can use up to 63 ASCII characters (letters, numbers, and symbols)
•  You can use up to 63 ASCII letters and numbers characters only
•  You can use 64 hex characters (numbers 0–9, letters A–F only), such as 41 69 3a 5e, and so on.
 Naturally, whatever you use when you set up the router has to be used for each and every device 
that will connect to the wireless network.  
  Why ASCII Works for Encryption Keys 
 With three choices, which is best? Unfortunately, limitations in some devices prevent you from 
entering some symbol keys (for example, a device with a limited onscreen keyboard, such as a 
smartphone), and some devices don’t support hex characters.  
 I recommend that you use a long (a 30- to 50-character ASCII text/numeric) encryption key so that 
PCs, tablets, smartphones, and portable game systems can all connect to your wireless network. 
You may have problems with some devices as you approach 60 characters.  
  Creating a Hard-to-Break, Easy-to-Remember 
Encryption Key  
 An encryption key (passphrase) that’s just a few characters long can be easy to break, so the 
longer the better. However, if you use a random password generator to create a key such as: 
OE03zI7tAG48BcAiR2U5R1XiFD2X4l5higMWoxN0DwJUAiO3NcIkqFc6YrnvnZL (key generated by 
GRC’s Perfect Passwords generator at  https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm ), you won’t be able 
to remember it. Instead, consider creating a long encryption key from a combination of words and 
numbers that you can remember. Here’s a made-up example that uses characters and numbers from 
the movie  Star Wars ,  Episode 4 (A New Hope)  to create a 60-character encryption key:  
 LukeSkywalker3Jawas2Wookie1DeathStar0LeiaOrgana5snubfighter  
 Tip 
 Instead of retyping the encryption key at every device you want to add to your wireless network, copy the 
encryption key into a text (Notepad) file, preferably on a USB thumb drive you can put away for emergen-
cies. 
 If you need to enter the encryption key on a device that has a USB port, you can insert the thumb drive 
and copy the encryption key from the file into the appropriate dialog in the connection setup. To set up a 
smartphone or tablet, send the encryption key via email or messaging and then copy it from the file.  

Troubleshooting Internet Problems
82
 Wi-Fi Protected Setup Problems and Solutions 
 If you’ve been through the process of entering encryption keys before, you know that a secure 
encryption key is more than a few characters long and can be hard to type. To make network setup 
easier, most router and PC adapter vendors support a technology called Wi-Fi Protected Setup 
(WPS). With WPS, you have three setup options, depending on your equipment:  
•  Press a button on the router and the adapter. On some routers, the button might be an onscreen
clickable button in the router configuration program.
•  Enter a PIN number from the device into the router’s WPS setup dialog.
•  Enter a PIN number from the router into the device’s setup
dialog.
 Although WPS is easy, it is not always the best way to set up 
your device. Here are some reasons why:  
•  WPS is not as secure as other methods — WPS encryption can
be overcome with a brute-force attack. For this reason, many
wireless router vendors now offer options to disable WPS.
•  Be sure to check any warnings on new wireless devices
before you use WPS to add them to an existing network — For example, Epson states that WPS
should  not be used to set up its wireless printers if it was not used to set up other devices on the
network. Using WPS in this situation could disrupt existing wireless connections. A good general
rule is: if you’ve been using WPS for wireless network setup, keep using it. However, if you’ve
been using manual wireless network setup, don’t change to WPS.
•  Some devices don’t support WPS — Both the router and the device must support WPS, or you will
need to enter the encryption key as discussed earlier.
 Solving Signal Strength Problems  
 As with any radio-frequency device, the further your Wi-Fi adapter is from a wireless router or 
access point, the weaker the signal is likely to be. Wireless-N and Wireless-AC routers and adapters 
are designed to use reflected signals to help overcome this problem (two or more antennas improve 
range and performance), and 2.4GHz channels have a longer range than 5.0GHz channels.  
 Note 
 The PIN number is typi-
cally found on a label on 
the router or device. Some 
routers might also list it in 
their configuration program 
dialog. 
 Note 
 The newest version of Wi-Fi Protected Setup supports NFC (near field communication). This is also known as 
tap-to-connect technology. This technology, first developed for smartphones, enables a connection when 
devices are moved next to each other. NFC makes it easier to add new devices, such as smartphones and 
tablets, to a Wi-Fi–encrypted network. NFC support must be present in both the router and the device in 
order to use this WPS setup method.

CHAPTER
 Are you wondering if this problem affects you? Try this simple test. If you have a dual-band device 
(one that can use both 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz signals) and a dual-band router that is set up to use both 
types of signals, look at the signal strength as you move your device around your home or office. 
As  Figure   3.6  illustrates, the signal strength of a 2.4GHz radio is typically stronger than that of a 
5.0GHz radio at medium to longer distances.  
 For a more precise view of signal strength, channels, and potential interference from other net-
works, install the free Wifi Analyzer app on your Android smartphones or tablet (it’s available from 
Google Play). Wifi Analyzer displays signal strength for wireless networks in real time, so as you 
walk around your home or office, you can see changes in signal strength in your network and other 
detected networks ( see Figure   3.7 ). 
 In some parts of your home or business, you might discover that you have hardly any signal. Even if 
you upgrade your router to a three- or four-antenna device and replace your single-antenna adapt-
ers in your PCs to multi-antenna adapters, you might still have range problems with non-PC devices 
such as smartphones (such as the Galaxy S III shown in  Figure   3.6 ), tablets, and portable gaming 
systems.

 You can adopt three strategies to extend the range of your wireless network:  
•  Improve antenna positioning.
•  Install wireless repeaters or signal boosters.
•  Use powerline adapters.
 Improving Antenna Positioning  
 The antennas in your wireless router and the adapters your computers use to connect to the router 
are the first keys to better range and signal strength.

 Caution 
 Some older wireless routers (primarily Wireless-G models) have removable antennas, enabling you to replace 
stock antennas with higher-gain antennas. However, results are mixed, and with many new routers lacking 
provision for replacement antennas, it’s best to look at other methods for extending the range of your net-
work. 

85

CHAPTER
•  If your router has external antennas, adjust them to different angles to help improve signal
quality.
•  If your router has internal antennas, consider hanging the router on the wall or turning it 90
degrees to improve signal quality.
•  Putting your router in a central position in your home or office helps you get maximum useful
range, as it broadcasts signals in a 3D “bubble.” If your router is located on an outside wall,
much of the signal is being broadcast outside of your home or work area.
 If you use a USB wireless adapter, consider using a USB extension cable to help get a better signal 
to your computer. Some USB wireless adapters include this type of cable ( see Figure   3.8 ), or you can 
buy one from a local or online vendor.   
 Installing and Using a Signal Repeater  
 If changing router or antenna positions isn’t giving you a strong enough signal in some parts of your 
home or office, repeat your wireless signal.  
 A signal repeater is a special type of wireless access point that receives a wireless signal from a 
router and rebroadcasts it. Some signal repeaters plug directly into an AC wall outlet, and others 
use a separate AC adapter and resemble a router. Some also include Fast or Gigabit Ethernet ports 
( see Figure   3.9 ).

 Here’s how to set up a typical unit using WPS:  
1.  Determine where you want to place the repeater.
2.  Plug the repeater into AC power (on some models, the repeater itself plugs into the wall).
3.  If you are using Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), press the WPS button on the router and on the
repeater or use the PIN number method (depending upon your router and repeater’s features).
Refer to  Figure   3.24 .
4.  To connect to the repeater, select it from the list of available networks and enter the encryption
key (if prompted).
 With some models, the instructions are a little different:  
1.  Determine where you want to place the repeater.
2.  Plug the repeater into AC power.

 Using Powerline Networking  
 You can use Powerline networking to provide remote portions of your home or office with either 
wired or wireless networking. See “Installing and Using Powerline Adapters,” later in this chapter, 
for more information.  
 Speeding Up a Slow Wired Network  
 Although wireless networking gets all the attention in home and office networking, there’s still a 
place for wired networking, also known as Ethernet:  
•  Ethernet can’t be “borrowed” by neighbors or strangers the way Wi-Fi can be.
•  Ethernet is simpler to configure than Wi-Fi: just plug it in!
•  Gigabit Ethernet is faster than all wireless networks except Wireless-AC.
 If you already have wiring in place or have short cable runs you can hide behind furniture or with 
cable management devices, wired networking can make more sense than wireless. This is especially 
true if you have brick or concrete walls or other obstacles that make wireless networking slow or 
that give it limited range.

 Gigabit Ethernet (1000Mbps) is the fastest wired Ethernet standard available for home use. It’s 
faster than most wireless networks, making for maximum-speed file sharing, streaming media 
downloads, and network printing. Here’s how to determine whether you’re already enjoying Gigabit 
Ethernet speeds:  
1.  Go to a Windows computer that is using a wired Ethernet connection in your home or office.
2.  Open the Network and Sharing Center (available from Control Panel or from the Network menu).
3.  Double-click the Local Area Connection shortcut ( see Figure   3.12 ).
4.  The connection speed is shown in the status box that appears ( see Figure   3.13 ).
5.  Close the Status, Network and Sharing, and Control Panel or Network dialogs.

Troubleshooting Internet Problems

 If your network is currently running at Fast Ethernet (100Mbps) speeds, you should check three 
things to determine whether you can run at Gigabit Ethernet (1000Mbps) speeds:  
•  Wiring — Gigabit Ethernet requires CAT5e or CAT6 cable (Fast Ethernet uses CAT5 cable but can
use faster versions as well).
•  PC Ethernet ports — Most newer computers with wired network (RJ-45) ports support Gigabit
Ethernet.
•  Router or switch Ethernet ports — Low-cost routers and switches typically have 10/100 (Fast
Ethernet) ports, whereas mid-range and high-end late-model routers typically have 10/100/1000
ports that support Fast and Gigabit Ethernet.
 How can you check the specifications for each of these potential bottlenecks? Read on for the 
answers. 
 Checking Your Network Cable  
 To see what type of network cable you have, examine the cables themselves.  Figure  3.14 illustrates 
a typical CAT5e cable and its markings.

CHAPTER
 If all the cables between your wireless router, wired router, or switches and your computers are 
CAT5e or CAT6, your network has the potential to run at Gigabit speeds. However, if you find CAT5 
cable, don’t replace it until you determine which of your computers or devices have Gigabit Ethernet 
ports. 
 Checking Your Computers for Gigabit Ports  
 To determine whether the network port(s) in your computers support Gigabit Ethernet, follow this 
procedure in Windows 7 or from the Windows 8/8.1 desktop:  
1.  Open Windows Explorer (Windows 7) or File Explorer (Windows 8/8.1).
2.  Right-click  Computer  (Windows 7) or This PC (Windows 8/8.1).
and select  Properties .
3.  Open Device Manager.
4.  Expand the Network Adapters category.
5.  Look for an entry that reads Gigabit Ethernet, GBE, or similar
(see  Figure   3.15 ).
6.  Close Device Manager and System properties.
CAT 5E (CAT 5e) can run at Gigabit Ethernet speeds

 Note 
 If your Ethernet cabling is built in to the wall, you might be able to see the cable markings by removing 
the cover of an RJ-45 wall jack. You can also hire a network cable installer to test your network for Gigabit 
Ethernet compatibility. If your cable was installed as part of new construction, check with your builder to

 Checking Your Router or Switch  
 To determine whether your router or switch supports Gigabit Ethernet, use one of the following 
methods: 
•  If you can get access to the router or switch, determine its name and revision number, and then
look up the router’s specifications online. Many current-model routers, including those with
802.11ac support (the fastest Wireless standard), support Fast Ethernet (100Mbps) rather than
Gigabit Ethernet.
•  If you cannot access the router or switch, compare the speeds supported to the status of the
network connection (refer to  Figure   3.15 ). If the wiring used between the adapter and router or
switch is CAT5e or CAT6, and the network adapter supports Gigabit Ethernet, the router sup-
ports only Fast Ethernet speeds.
GBE = Gigabit Ethernet
100Mbps connection speed = Fast Ethernet

Speeding Up a Slow Wired Network

CHAPTER
  Installing and Using Powerline Adapters  
 Although HomePlug (which transmits network signals through your 
home power lines) is not as well known as Ethernet or Wi-Fi, it rep-
resents a useful way to extend a network when it’s not feasible to 
repeat a wireless signal to other parts of your home or office.  
 A HomePlug network includes two transceivers:  
•  One plugs into an AC wall outlet and connects to a wired
Ethernet port on a router or switch.
•  The other transceiver plugs into another AC wall outlet,
enabling you to connect your device via Ethernet.
•  In some kits, the second transceiver includes a Wi-Fi trans-
ceiver. If the transceiver includes both an Ethernet port and
a Wi-Fi transceiver, you can use either wired or wireless Ethernet (Wi-Fi) connections for the
remote device.
 To add an additional device, buy a compatible adapter. If the devices are just a few feet away from 
the remote adapter, you can connect the adapter to the uplink port on a Fast or Gigabit Ethernet 
switch to share the connection among multiple devices.  
 To make the connection between the transceivers, just plug them in and push a button on 
each adapter to pair them (you can use more than two adapters on most HomePlug networks). 
 Figure   3.16  illustrates a typical setup using two adapters and an Ethernet switch.  
 HomePlug is a good choice for masonry or concrete construction because it is not affected by solid 
walls or heavy ceilings.  
 Note 
 Three other factors can slow down your network: the presence of sub-standard keystone jacks (the wall 
plugs used for Ethernet connections), female/female Ethernet adapters (used to connect two cables 
together for longer runs), or the use of one or more Ethernet hubs.  
 If your wired network contains one or more Ethernet hubs, replace them with Ethernet switches. A hub 
resembles a switch physically, but it subdivides the total bandwidth of the connection among the connected 
ports. For example, if you have a Fast Ethernet (100Mbps) hub with four ports in use, each port gets only 
25Mbps connection speed.  
 Note 
 The original 85Mbps 
HomePlug standard has been 
replaced by faster HomePlug 
AV (200Mbps) and HomePlug 
AV2 (500Mbps) standards. 
You can determine the ver-
sion of HomePlug supported 
by the rated speed of the 
adapter.

 Airplane Mode Versus Wi-Fi Mode  
 If you are unable to connect your mobile device to a wireless network or to a cellular network, your 
device might be set to Airplane mode. Airplane mode ( see Figure   3.17 ) shuts off all radios in your 
device, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular. This setting, originally developed to enable mobile 
device users to use their devices during airplane takeoffs and landings, has other benefits:  
•  Longer battery life.
•  Privacy.
•  Mobile devices typically display a small airplane icon in their notification area when Airplane
mode is enabled.
 To enable Airplane mode, use the Settings menu in your mobile device ( see Figure   3.18 ). On 
Windows 8/8.1, you can enable Airplane mode from the Networks menu (refer to  Figure   3.11 ).

 Switching Connection Types Manually  
 When you use a mobile device with both Wi-Fi and cellular data services, keep in mind that you 
can use only one service at a time. Typical device configuration has Wi-Fi running all the time with 
automatic connection when you revisit a hotspot you’ve already configured (such as at home or the 
office). 
 However, you might run into a situation in which your device is connected to a weak Wi-Fi signal 
that’s not good enough to use or has no Internet connection, although you have a 3G or 4G signal 
that’s strong enough but ignored by your device. In those cases, follow this procedure:  
1.  Go into your device’s Settings menu and turn off Wi-Fi.
2.  Your device should connect automatically to your cellular network.
3.  When you go back to an area that has a higher-quality Wi-Fi signal with Internet access, enable
Wi-Fi again.
 Mobile Hotspots and 
Connection Security  
 Although signs offering “Free Wi-Fi” are showing up almost 
everywhere, from hotel lobbies and convention centers to restau-
rants and coffee shops, you might not want to use those services. 
If you use them, you are connecting to an unsecure network. With 
no encryption, email, e-banking, online shopping, and other trans-
actions can be exposed to hackers. Free connections are great for 
casual Internet use, but if you’re trying to work or sign in to bank 
accounts or use e-commerce, a free connection is not the way 
to go.  
 Using a Cellular-Enabled Device as a Hotspot  
 If you have a smartphone, tablet, or laptop that can share its cellular data connection, you have 
a secure connection for your laptop or tablet. You can share your connection with a single device 
by using USB tethering, or you can share the connection with multiple devices by using the Wi-Fi 
hotspot feature.  
 Tip 
 By default, Airplane mode disables all communication to and from your device. However, you can selec-
tively enable Wi-Fi or Bluetooth on most devices after you enable Airplane mode. You can use this feature 
to bypass your phone’s cellular connection, saving you money when traveling outside your cellular network 
provider area or while visiting a foreign country (see  http://52tiger.net/enable-iphone-airplane-mode-keep-
wifi-while-traveling/ ). 
 Tip 
 If you have a secure remote 
connection service running 
on your office or home 
computer, such as Go To My 
PC, you can connect to that 
service and use your remote 
connection to check email 
or use e-commerce websites. 
Just use the web browser 
on the remote computer for 
your transactions.

 Many websites are designed to support mobile devices with a mobile-optimized version that’s eas-
ier to read on a small screen. However, if you find that the mobile-optimized version leaves out too 
much information, there’s usually a way to switch to the desktop version:  
1.  Open the website on your device. If the mobile version is displayed, scroll around until you locate
a link to the desktop version (see  Figure   3.22 ).

 Some cellular providers charge an additional fee if you turn your cellular device into a hotspot. Check with 
your mobile service provider for details. And keep in mind that the data usage of every device connected to 
a mobile hotspot is counted toward your total data allocation. If you’re not careful, using a mobile hotspot 
could cost you extra money in overages.

CHAPTER
 Router Configuration  
 To take advantage of the recommendations in this chapter, you might need to adjust the configura-
tion of your wireless router. To get started, follow these steps:  
1.  Even if you normally connect to your router wirelessly, connect
an Ethernet cable to one of the router’s switch ports and to the
Ethernet port on your computer. Although a few routers can be
managed wirelessly, most require you to use a wired connection
to view or change settings.
2.  Enter the IP address for your router into your web browser. If
you don’t know the IP address, check your router documenta-
tion. You can typically get a PDF or web page version from the
router vendor.
3.  Provide the username and password when prompted. The
default settings are provided in your router documentation. If
you change them, be sure to record them for reference.
 To change wireless settings such as network name (SSID), security, encryption key (password), 
channel, and others, go to the Wireless Setup dialog (refer to  Figure   3.2 ). 
 If you need to use WPS to set up a device, go to the Wi-Fi Protected Setup dialog (see  Figure   3.24 ). 
 Tip 
 Use  IPConfig/all  from the 
command prompt to display 
the IP configuration informa-
tion for all network adapt-
ers in your computer. The 
Default Gateway listed for 
your Ethernet port is the IP 
address of your router.  
Choose a method to connect with the device using WPS
Slide to enable WPS

Troubleshooting Internet Problems
102
 Use the Device and Client (MAC address, physical address, device listing) table feature to see the 
names and MAC (physical) addresses of the devices connected to your network ( see Figure   3.25 ). 
 If some game systems are having difficulty connecting to the Internet through the router, you 
might need to set up port forwarding, or you can set the router to provide direct pass-through of 
all Internet traffic to and from a particular device on the network (Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ). To 
make these changes, look for your router’s advanced menu.  
 When you are finished making changes, save your changes (on some routers, there’s a Save button 
at the bottom of each screen) and close the browser. If you normally don’t use a wired connection to 
your router, disconnect the Ethernet cable from your computer. Leave it connected to the router for 
future use.

Firmware Updates

CHAPTER
 Firmware Updates  
 Firmware, also known as “software on a chip,” controls the basic 
functions of both routers and mobile devices, such as tablets and 
smartphones. Firmware updates are used to solve problems with a 
device or to add features.  
 To obtain a firmware update for a smartphone or tablet, contact the 
wireless service vendor or the device manufacturer.  
 Updating Your Router  
 Firmware updates for your router can come from one of two locations:  
•  The router manufacturer
•  A third-party firmware provider, such as DD-WRT
  Vendor-Provided Firmware  
 To obtain a router update from your vendor:  
1.  Check the model number and version number of your router. This information is typically pro-
vided on a label on the bottom or side of the router. Because different router models might use
different chipsets, you must know exactly which router model you are updating.
2.  To determine the firmware version that’s installed, log in to your router. This information might
be located on the initial login page or elsewhere; check your router’s documentation for details.
3.  To obtain an updated version, go to the router vendor’s website and visit the Support or
Downloads section of the website. Look up your router and see the firmware revisions available
and the problems they fix (see  Figure   3.26 ).
4.  If a different firmware revision will solve problems you’re having with your router, download the
newest firmware revision. The newest version incorporates all previous fixes as well as the spe-
cific fixes noted.
5.  Before you install the new firmware, be sure to document your router’s current settings. You can
use screen capture in Windows or a digital camera set for close-ups. This is especially important
if you have changed default settings for the router login username and password or have set
up port forwarding or other advanced features. Some of these settings could be lost during the
update process.
6.  Follow the instructions provided in your documentation or on the website for installing the firm-
ware revision. In most cases, you will need to log in to your router with a wired Ethernet con-
nection. If your router has a USB port for use with external storage, you might need to copy the
firmware update file to a USB flash drive.
 Note 
 For more about the update 
process, see  Chapter   14 , 
“Keeping Your Devices 
Updated.” 

Troubleshooting Internet Problems
104
7.  After the update is complete, you will need to reset or restart your router.
8.  Redo any custom settings that were changed by the update. Use the documentation you created
in step 5.
  DD-WRT and Other Third-Party Router Firmware
 Although updated firmware can correct problems with your router’s operation, you might still be
disappointed with your router’s features. However, your router might have hidden features that can
be accessed if your router can use third-party firmware (firmware produced by a vendor other than
the router vendor).

 Caution 
 If you find that revised firmware is causing other problems, you might want to try an earlier revision. We 
don’t recommend upgrading firmware just “because it’s there.” A firmware update should be done only 
when it solves a particular problem on your network.  

105
Firmware Updates

CHAPTER
 Many (but not all) routers support third-party firmware. There are numerous third-party router firm-
ware projects (see  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wireless_router_firmware_projects  for a par-
tial list). The best-known of these is DD-WRT.  
 DD-WRT was originally developed for the Linksys WRT54G series of wireless routers but now
supports dozens of models from many vendors. In  Figure   3.27 , DD-WRT is running on a Netgear
WDNR3400. DD-WRT is also being used as the original firmware for a number of current and forth-
coming routers from companies such as Buffalo and Linksys.
 DD-WRT provides comprehensive, easy-to-view information about your wireless network’s configura-
tion and enables many routers to be used as bridges to other networks, as access points, or as repeat-
ers, and to control advanced settings for coexistence with Bluetooth and other wireless networks.
 To determine whether your router model and revision is supported by DD-WRT, go to the DD-WRT 
website ( www.dd-wrt.com ) and use the Router Database to look up your router manufacturer. As 
you can see from  Figure   3.28 , it’s essential to know the revision as well as the model number of your 
router because some revisions of a particular router are not supported.

  Avoiding “Bricking” Your Router  
 The term “bricking” is slang for rendering your device useless through a bad firmware update. To 
avoid this problem, follow these guidelines:  
•  If you are installing a firmware update from a PC (desktop or laptop), use a wired Ethernet con-
nection.
•  If you are using a laptop, make sure it’s plugged into a working AC outlet.

 Caution 
 Before you install replacement firmware, be sure to document your router’s current settings. You will need 
to reconfigure your router after you install third-party firmware.  

107
Firmware Updates
3
CHAPTER
•  Do not start the update process if power might be interrupted. If the power goes out during an
update, your update fails, and your router will need to be serviced.
•  Be sure to download the firmware made for your router number  and revision. Router manufactur-
ers are notorious for changing the components used in different revisions of a particular model
while leaving the exterior trim the same.
•  Follow the firmware vendor’s directions exactly.
 After you complete the process, your router will list the revised firmware version after you log in 
to it. Depending upon the revision (and particularly if you have installed third-party firmware), you 
might need to reconfigure some or all of your settings. Use the screen captures or photos you took 
earlier to help you use the correct settings.

 Got Malware? What It Is and What It Does  
 Are you seeing unending pop-up ads on your screen? Has your browser forgotten your home 
page? Is your formerly fast computer just crawling along? Maybe your browser can’t connect to the 
Internet anymore? These and similar problems might have a single cause: malware.  
 Malware  (short for malicious software) is a general term for software that can slow down your com-
puter, steal information without your knowledge or consent, and threaten your access to your infor-
mation and to the Internet.  
 The most common categories of malware include the following:  
•  Virus— A malware program that spreads to other programs when you run it.
•  Trojan horse— Malware that pretends to help the user (video player, antivirus, and so on). This
type of malware often uses names and screen displays that are similar to legitimate programs
and apps.
•  Worm— A malware program that spreads itself automatically over a computer network.
•  Fake security software— Malware that pretends to find viruses and malware on your system and
asks you to pay a fee for removal of the (alleged) malware.
•  Ransomware— Malware that encrypts (scrambles) your computer’s information and issues a
demand onscreen for payment so that the process can be reversed. Typically, it includes a time
period in which payment must be made to avoid permanent loss of your information.
•  Rootkit— Malware that hides itself inside the operating system to prevent detection by normal
means, such as displaying running programs or processes.
•  Keylogger— Malware that records each keystroke made on your system, enabling the developer
to determine your passwords to various websites, banking information, and other confidential
information.
•  Spyware— Malware that collects information from your computer and transmits it to remote web-
sites.
•  Adware— Malware that displays pop-up ads, which can slow down your computer.
•  Unwanted browser helper objects (BHOs)— Malware that changes how your browser works.
BHOs can add toolbars to your browser window, redirect searches away from your normal search
provider, and change your browser’s default home page.
 Some legitimate programs might perform some of these tasks. For example, when you install some 
free programs, you might be asked if you want to install a toolbar or install a new browser as your 
default. The difference between legitimate programs and malware is that malware makes changes 
to your computer or web browser without telling you about the changes. Malware works in the 
shadows. To help you keep your computer running properly and your personal and business infor-
mation safe, we’re going to shine some light on malware and tell you how to deal with it.

CHAPTER
 Malware Attacks via Your Browser  
 If you’re like most computer or mobile device users, you’re probably visiting websites every day, 
and your web browser can be used as a way to try to deliver malware as well as information. Here 
are a couple of examples:  
 A website offers to upgrade your video player (see  Figures   4.1 and   4.2  ).  
 A website appears to scan your system for viruses and in just a few seconds, displays its results 
and offers to fix the problem ( see Figure   4.3 ). This fake antivirus program mimics Microsoft Security 
Essentials, a popular free anti-malware program from Microsoft.  
 Accept any of these “helpful” offers, and you’ll actually install malware on your system.

CHAPTER
 Malware Attacks via Email  
 Emails that purport to be from banks, shippers, or other institutions that you might use are also pop-
ular methods of distributing malware. The content of messages ( see Figure   4.4 and   4.5 ) vary, but the 
objective is to get you to click a link to a file containing malware ( Figure   4.4 ) or a fraudulent website 
link ( Figure   4.5 ). This type of an attack is also known as “phishing.” 
Poor grammar and/or spelling are typical
in spam/malware emails.

 Malware Attacks via Phone Calls from 
Alleged Helplines  
 The latest method for convincing you to install malware on your systems is an unsolicited phone 
call (“cold call”) from a person purporting to be a contractor for Microsoft. The caller claims that 
there are errors on your system, typically by asking you to view the errors listed in Windows Event 
Viewer. After a misleading pitch about the meaning and severity of these errors, the caller guides 
you through the process of installing remote control software on your computer and offering to “fix” 
your computer. These scams can separate you from your money, or could also be used for informa-
tion  theft.  
 If you get a cold call claiming to be from Microsoft, McAfee, Dell, and so on, just hang up (these ven-
dors do  not hire contractors to do this type of work).  
 Malware Attacks via USB or Flash Memory  
 The Autorun and AutoPlay features included in most versions of Windows enable malware infecting 
a USB drive or a flash memory card to infect a host system.  
 If your system is configured to automatically start an executable file, any malware stored on your 
device as an executable file runs automatically as soon as you connect the device to your system. If 
you use a USB drive or a flash memory card to move files between computers, you might be vulner-
able to this type of an attack.  
 Your Role in Stopping Malware—An 
Overview  
 You need multilayered protection to stop malware from disrupting your digital life, and the first 
layer of protection is you. To avoid malware, you need to do the following:  
•  Avoid falling for common email and online scams.
•  Enable browser-based protection against fraudulent websites.
•  Install protection against malware.
•  Use multiple types of protection when possible.
•  Regularly scan for malware.
•  Repair damage caused by malware when it occurs.

Avoiding Online and Email Scams

CHAPTER
 Avoiding Online and Email Scams  
 Scam ,  con game , and  confidence game  are three terms for a series of events that purport to pro-
vide you with benefits such as more security, updated information, or more money, but are actually 
designed to separate you from your money, information, or identity. Many of the threats described 
earlier in this chapter can be classified as scams or con games.  
 How can you avoid being scammed? Think carefully about the information or links being provided 
and avoid suspicious ones. Here are some examples:  
•  Recognize the differences between legitimate and fraudulent websites.
•  Check email links before you click them.
•  Beware of Zip-format file attachments.
•  Log in to your financial or e-commerce websites with your browser rather than with a link in an
email.
•  Call your bank or financial institution to determine if an email purporting to come from them was
one they actually sent.
•  Use browsers designed to warn you of possibly fraudulent websites.
 Signs of Fraudulent Websites  
 One popular method used in creating fraudulent websites is to mimic the legitimate website’s 
“trade dress”—its colors, fonts, and graphic design. For example, compare the fake video player 
update dialog in  Figure   4.1   with this actual Adobe Flash update dialog ( see Figure   4.6 ).

 A second tip-off that’s especially useful for spotting fraudulent e-commerce and banking sites is 
the lack of security on the login page.  Figure   4.7 shows the login page for a fake bank website, and 
 Figure   4.8  shows the login page for the actual bank website.

CHAPTER
 Check Before You Click  
 By floating your mouse over a link in an email or webpage, you can determine the actual destination 
of that link.  Figure   4.5 showed how to use this method to determine that an email was fraudulent. 
 Figure   4.9  shows an example of a legitimate email for comparison.  
 Don’t Click the Zip  
 The Zip archive format is very useful for reducing the size of large files for emailing and for gather-
ing two or more files into a single file that you can email, save to disc, or upload. However, Zip files 
are also one of the favorite ways for malware authors to infect your system because you can’t see 
the contents of the file unless you click it, and that’s all it takes to infect your system (refer to  
Figure   4.4  ).  
Personalized email. 
Floating mouse over link reveals eBay URL.

sage from eBay.   
 Caution 
 Although the eBay email shown in  Figure   4.9 includes an eBay logo, the presence of the company’s logo in 
an email message or on a webpage is not a guarantee that the email or webpage is legitimate. It’s easy for 
malware creators to copy these graphical elements from a legitimate site and reuse them.  

Curing Malware and Stopping Scams
118
 There is no need for legitimate vendors to use attachments in email for invoices, messages, or 
reminders. So, if you receive a message with an attachment that you didn’t request or one from an 
unknown sender, ignore it.  
 Log In, Don’t Click In  
 Both legitimate and fraudulent email senders offer links you can click if you need to interact with 
their websites. So, how can you protect yourself from clicking a dangerous link?  
 The easiest way to deal with a suspicious link that purports to be from eBay, PayPal, your bank, or 
a store is to ignore it. If an actual problem exists with your account, you can find out what it is with-
out clicking. Enter the website address into your browser window, log in, and check your account 
status. 
 Let Your Browser Protect You  
 Recent versions of Internet Explorer and some third-party browsers contain a variety of features 
to help protect you from suspicious websites. Depending on the browser, you might need to use 
optional add-ons to help protect yourself.  
  Microsoft Internet Explorer  
 Internet Explorer versions 9 and later include built-in SmartScreen technology to help protect you 
while you’re browsing. SmartScreen checks for phishing attempts, provides warnings for unknown 
files, and blocks malware. In  Figure   4.10 , Internet Explorer 11 blocks a website from downloading a 
file containing malware.  
 SmartScreen also blocks access to unsafe websites ( see Figure   4.11 ).  
 To make sure your SmartScreen filter is turned on, open the Settings (gearbox) menu, click or tap 
Safety, and review the settings. If SmartScreen filter is turned off, you should turn it on.  
 Note 
 Many email programs and services automatically send messages with Zip-format attachments to junk 
mail to help protect your system. If you need to send someone a file, make sure you let the recipient know 
a file attachment is coming and, if possible, send the file in its normal state, not as a Zip archive (com-
pressed) file. If the files are too large to send via email, consider using a file hosting service such as Dropbox 
( www.dropbox.com ) to send and receive files.  
 Tip 
 To make a bogus link look legitimate, malware creators and scammers often create a link that displays the 
alleged URL as a link (for example, http://www.your bank.com), but the actual link points to the malware 
or scam website. Remember, you can hover the mouse over a link in either an email or a web page to see 
what it points to.

  Mozilla Firefox  
 Mozilla Firefox also includes built-in blocking for fraudulent websites and known attack pages ( see 
Figure   4.12 ). 
 Unlike Internet Explorer, Firefox automatically saves downloaded files and leaves it up to you to 
decide when to run (install) them. As a consequence, some malware that Internet Explorer would 
block might not be blocked by Firefox. For example, a malware program that was blocked by 
Internet Explorer’s SmartScreen filter was downloaded without a warning by Firefox. However, 
the real-time protection provided by my system’s anti-malware app stopped my system from being 
infected ( see Figure   4.13 ). 
 To help improve Firefox’s anti-malware protection, I recommend installing the following add-ons:  
•  NoScript— Permits or blocks active scripting on websites as you direct
•  Web of Trust— Rates websites on their trustworthiness
 These are available from the Get Add-ons menu on the Firefox Settings menu. Web of Trust also 
supports other browsers (see  www.mywot.com for details).  
 Figure   4.14  illustrates how NoScript blocks a script from running and permits you to specify script 
settings for a particular website.

  Is Browser-Based Protection Enough?  
 Although it’s helpful to have your browser fighting malware for you, it’s not the only tool you need. 
Even if a browser said it blocked malware, sometimes the anti-malware tool that was running with 
real-time protection also needed to clean the infection. Also, different browsers provided different 
levels of protection.  
 Don’t depend on your browser as your only protection, especially if you use Windows or Android 
devices. The following sections help you understand how to build multilevel protection against mal-
ware. 
 Preventing and Removing Malware on 
Windows Devices  
 As you learned in the previous section, modern web browsers provide some tools for battling mal-
ware. However, you need additional protection against the following threats:  
•  Real-time protection against malware accessed via the Web, email, or removable drives
•  Malware scanning to remove infections that get past real-time protection
•  Spyware scanning to locate and remove privacy threats, such as tracking cookies and apps

CHAPTER
 Start with a full-featured anti-malware program that provides real-time protection and also periodi-
cally scans your drives for malware. Windows 8/8.1 includes Windows Defender, which provides 
real-time and scan-based anti-malware protection. If you prefer to use third-party anti-malware 
programs with Windows 8/8.1 or Windows RT, use the Windows Compatibility website to search for 
compatible products:  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/Home . 
 For links to commercial products (some of which offer free versions) for older versions of Windows, 
go to:  http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/antivirus-partners  (select Windows 7, 
Windows Vista, or Windows XP).  
 Figure   4.19   shows malware detected by Microsoft Security Essentials (a free product available from 
the Microsoft Antivirus Partners website).  
 To supplement real-time protection, you should also install an anti-malware scanner that can coexist 
with real-time protection. Malwarebytes ( www.malwarebytes.com ) is free, fast, and easy to set up, 
and it is highly regarded by the industry.  Figure   4.20 reveals the results of a scan for malware after 
browsers and anti-malware apps claimed to stop infections of my system. As you can see, there 
were still several problems to remove.

 To help remove spyware such as tracking cookies or apps, you should also install an antispyware 
app that can coexist with real-time protection. SUPERAntiSpyware ( www.superantispyware.com ) is 
available in a free version and is also well-reviewed by the industry.  Figure   4.21 shows the results 
of a scan, revealing 95 tracking cookies on the system.

 Free Versus Paid Anti-Malware and Antispyware Apps  
 With a number of highly regarded anti-malware and antispyware apps available free, why pay 
for protection? A paid version of free apps typically adds features such as telephone or priority 
product support, automatic updates, real-time protection, or automatic and scheduled scans 
(see product descriptions for details). If you use free apps, it’s up to you to keep them updated 
and scan your system regularly.

CHAPTER
 Preventing and Removing Malware on iOS 
Devices 
 Even though Apple iOS devices are not vulnerable to malware attacks designed to target Windows-
based systems, you should still protect your devices against common threats. Because iOS devices 
exchange information with Windows and MacOS devices, an unprotected iOS device can be used as 
an attack gateway.  
 IOS-based anti-malware products provide features such as on-demand email attachment scanning 
(VirusBarrier iOS), protection against websites that track your activities or contain malware (AVG 
Safe Browser), and automatic contact backup and discovery of a lost device (Lookout). These and 
other anti-malware products are available through the iOS App Store.  
 Figure   4.22   illustrates how VirusBarrier iOS can be used to scan an email attachment.

 Preventing and Removing Malware on 
Android Devices  
 Android devices, unlike iOS devices, have become frequent malware targets. Unfortunately, many 
apps in the Google Play store are infected with malware. Although Google has improved its detec-
tion of malware-infected apps, they can still be installed from the Google Store. Thankfully, there are 
also a large number of full-featured security and anti-malware apps for Android available through 
the Google Play store.  
 Typical features include blocking access to hostile websites, scanning system contents for malware, 
improving performance, and providing theft protection. In  Figure   4.24 , the AVG AntiVirus FREE app 
for Android detected the Wallpaper Dragonball app from the Google Store as intrusive Adware and 
prompted me to uninstall it.  
 The Clean Sweep app is designed primarily to improve performance by removing junk files and idle 
programs, but it also includes anti-malware scanning. In  Figure   4.25 , it automatically detected the 
EICAR test file (a harmless file designed to test virus and malware detection) and prompted me to 
uninstall (remove) it.

CHAPTER
 Repairing Malware Damage on Windows 
Devices 
 If a Windows-based device is infected with malware, removing the malware itself can sometimes 
require scanning with more than one program. Sometimes Windows settings are damaged to the 
point that the system suffers multiple malfunctions.  
 The Windows Repair tool from the Tweaking.com website provides an easy way to repair Windows 
problems caused by malware or other problems. Before performing repairs, it prompts you to select 
options, including running Malware Bytes to check for malware, running Chkdsk to check for disk 
errors, creating a system restore point, and using System File Checker to replace incorrect versions 
of system files.  Figure   4.26 illustrates a typical run.  
 If you prefer to make repairs manually, see  www.techradar.com/news/computing/pc/
how-to-repair-a-malware-damaged-pc-1032838 . 
 What if your system is so badly infected that it won’t start even in Safe Mode? Antivirus vendors 
including AVG, Kapersky, and many others offer downloadable files that you can use to create a 
bootable CD or USB drive that scans your system for malware and removes it.  
 The AVG Rescue CD is available at  www.avg.com/us-en/avg-rescue-cd . Kapersky Rescue Disk 10 is

 Can’t View RAW Files on Your PC  
 If your digital photos are always shot using the JPEG setting on your camera, your PC has no prob-
lem displaying them. However, if you start shooting RAW files, preferred by serious photographers 
for their improved sharpness, greater ability to fix exposure and color problems, and support for 
advanced features such as high dynamic range (HDR) imaging, your computer probably won’t be 
able to view or edit the results without some help from software—and you.  
 Check out  Figures   5.1 and   5.2 , which illustrate a folder that contains both RAW and JPEG photo-
graphs. As you can see, the JPEG files are displayed as thumbnails, but the RAW files are shown as 
icons. If you’re trying to enjoy your photo collection, being stuck in Icon City is not what you have in 
mind.

CHAPTER
 What Is a RAW File?  
 A RAW file is an unprocessed digital photograph. When you shoot pictures in RAW mode, the image 
your camera creates has not been compressed or processed. To use a RAW file, you must open it in 
a compatible photo-editing program and save it as a JPEG or other type of picture file.  
 RAW files are proprietary to individual digital camera and device makers. For example, recent and 
current Canon-brand cameras that shoot RAW files store them as .CR2 files, whereas Nikon uses 
the extension .NEF for its RAW files. The RAW files shown in  Figures   5.1 and   5.2 were shot with a 
Canon digital SLR (DSLR) camera.  
 RAW Versus JPEG Files  
 Whereas a RAW file must be processed with a program before you can view or use the photo, a 
JPEG file is processed by the digital camera, camcorder, smartphone, or tablet you use to create it. 
Settings for image quality, white balance, color settings, and more are applied when the file is cre-
ated. 
 Some digital cameras can shoot both RAW and JPEG files at the same time.

 What Is a Codec?  
 The term  codec , an abbreviation of “coder-decoder,” refers to a 
computer program that converts information from one form to 
another and back again. Your computer needs the appropriate 
RAW codec to display the contents of a RAW file in Windows 
(File) Explorer or convert it into another type (such as a JPEG) of 
file using Photo Gallery (part of Windows Essentials).  
 Finding and Installing RAW Codecs  
 There are three sources for RAW codecs that work with Microsoft 
Windows: 
•  The camera vendor
•  Microsoft
•  Third-party software vendors
 Let’s see how to get and use these products.  
  Vendor-Provided Codecs  
 Digital cameras that shoot in RAW typically include a CD or DVD that contains the appropriate RAW 
converter. You can also download codecs from the vendor’s support website.  
•  Advantages:  A vendor-provided codec won’t cost you anything, and it might also come with
photo-editing and management software. It typically works with a variety of Windows versions
going back to Windows XP.
•  Drawbacks:  If you use more than one brand of digital camera that shoots RAW, you will need to
install a different RAW codec for each brand of camera. 32-bit versions of Windows use different
codecs than 64-bit versions of Windows, and some camera vendors provide only 32-bit versions.
You might not be able to use the camera vendor’s photo-editing and management software with
RAW photos from other brands of cameras.
  Microsoft-Provided Codecs  
 Microsoft offers a free downloadable codec for digital cameras that shoot RAW files: the Microsoft 
Camera Codec Pack. Download it from the Microsoft Download Center at  www.microsoft.com/
downloads . 
•  Advantages:  A single download works with almost all cameras that shoot RAW files, from Canon
to Sony (see the download page for details). It also enables Windows Live Photo Gallery (part of
Windows Essentials) to display and convert RAW files for editing.
•  Drawbacks:  You will need to choose either the 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64 or AMD64) version,
depending on the version of Windows you have. Separate versions are available for Windows
Vista SP2/Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1.
 Note 
 You don’t need a separate 
RAW codec to edit RAW files 
if you have a RAW photo edi-
tor that includes its own RAW 
codecs. For example, Adobe 
Photoshop and Photoshop 
Elements include Adobe 
Camera RAW so they can 
display and edit RAW files. 
Adobe Lightroom and Corel 
PaintShop Pro have built-in 
RAW codecs.

CHAPTER
  Third-Party Codecs  
 Even though Microsoft provides a RAW codec for almost all digital cameras, you might prefer to try 
a third-party codec to get better performance or more features. Major vendors include the following:  
•  Ardfry Imaging, LLC— www.ardfry.com . Ardfry provides separate codecs for Canon RAW
(.CR2), Adobe Digital Negative (.DNG, the Adobe RAW format that can be used with Photoshop,
Lightroom, and other Adobe products), and Nikon RAW (.NEF). Ardfry also makes an Adobe
Photoshop codec that enables you to view Photoshop (PSD, AI, and EPS) files in Windows
Explorer and other apps. Free trials are available.
•  Axel Rietschin Software Developments—  www.fastpictureviewer.com . The FastPictureViewer
Codec pack provides single-file support for almost all digital cameras that shoot RAW files and is
highly customizable for better performance in viewing both JPEG and RAW files. Free trials are
available.
 After a suitable RAW codec is installed, you can view RAW and JPEG files on your system in 
Windows Explorer or File Explorer, as shown in  Figures  5.3 and   5.4 .  
 Note 
 Follow these links for more information and to download the correct version for your operating system:  
  •  Windows Vista SP2 and Windows 7— http://www.microsoft.com/en-pk/download/details.aspx?id=26829
  •  Windows 8 and Windows RT 8— http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2712101
  •  Windows 8.1 and Windows RT 8.1— http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2859675
 Windows 8/8.1 typically provides the correct version of the codec pack via Windows Update. However, you 
can download it manually, and you can check the preceding links to determine the camera models sup-
ported. 
 Note 
 RAW codecs provided by vendors other than the camera manufacturer can provide more viewing and 
customization options, and some vendors provide a single codec that can work with several types of RAW 
codecs from different camera brands.  
 The major advantage of a RAW codec provided by the camera manufacturer is that it will work with the 
latest models. Sometimes it takes a few months before Microsoft or third-party codecs support new models.

CHAPTER
 Can’t View RAW Files on Your Android 
Device 
 If you want to take your favorite photos with you on your Android tablet or smartphone, it’s easy to 
view them if you shot them in JPEG mode. Android’s built-in Gallery app has no problem display-
ing photos you shot with your device’s built-in camera (they’re stored as JPEG files) or JPEG photos 
you’ve downloaded from the Cloud or wireless network or accessed from a flash memory card.  
 However, if you’d prefer to view, manage, or edit RAW photos on your Android device, you need 
third-party software. Without RAW software, folders that contain RAW files appear to contain no 
files ( see Figure   5.5 ). 
 In this section, we’ll show you where to find RAW apps and how to use them. 
 Finding and Using RAW Apps for Android  
 RAW apps for Android devices are available from Google Play, the app store for Android devices. 
Use searches such as “RAW file viewer,” “RAW decoder,” and “RAW photo app” to find suitable 
programs.

 After you install a RAW app, use it to view the contents of a location that contains RAW files. RAW 
apps vary a great deal in features, so take advantage of free trials to see which ones work for you. 
Depending on the app you select and whether you opt for a free or paid app, you might get the fol-
lowing features:  
•  Viewing and conversion to JPEG or TIFF ( see Figure   5.6 )
•  Display of exposure metadata (aperture, shutter speed, camera, lens, and so on) (see  Figure   5.7 )
•  RGB exposure histograms (see  Figure   5.7 )
•  RAW image editing
•  Batch file rename, export, and import

 Can’t View RAW Files on Your iOS Device  
 Although there are plenty of RAW viewing and editing apps for 
Android devices, a recent search of the iOS App Store found only a 
couple. There’s a simple reason why: iPhoto for iOS.  
 Whether you want to view or edit JPEG or RAW photos, buy a copy 
of iPhoto for iOS and you have the tools you need.  Figure   5.8 shows 
how you can adjust exposure and add special effects to a RAW file.

 Can’t View Video on Your PC 
 Whether it’s a home movie, a fan-made trailer, or a commercial trailer and movie, the process of 
making video so it can be played on your computer involves two functions:  
•  Choosing a method for encoding the audio and video tracks
•  Selecting a file format for the resulting video
 You can have a playback program that supports the file format of a particular video, but if it doesn’t 
have the necessary audio and video codecs installed, it won’t be able to play the video. 
 There are three ways to help your computer play the video content you want to enjoy:  
•  Keep Adobe Flash updated.
•  Install the audio and video codecs needed for a particular video.
•  Install a third-party video player that includes support for playing back a variety of content.
 Let’s look at each of these in turn.

 Updating Adobe Flash  
 The Adobe Flash player has become the de facto player of choice for online video content. Frequent 
updates are necessary because of changes needed in player support and to enhance security.  
 How can you tell when you need to update Adobe Flash (or if you don’t have it installed)? You will 
see a prompt similar to the following when your web browser tries to play a Flash-based video ( see 
Figure   5.9  ):  
 Click the link, verify that you’re on the actual Adobe website (refer to  Figure   4.6 ), and follow the 
prompts to complete installation.  
 Determining Codecs Used by Windows Media Player  
 Windows Media Player (WMP) is the standard media playback program included in (or available free 
for) Windows 7 and Windows 8.x. Windows Media Player includes codecs for playing back many 
types of video content, but it might not include the codecs you need.

 To determine what codecs are installed on your system, follow these steps:  
1.  Open WMP.
2.  If the menu bar is not visible, click  Organize, Layout, Show Menu Bar.
3.  Click  Help ,  About Windows Media Player .
4.  Click the Technical Support Information link ( see Figure   5.10 ).
5.  Your web browser displays a report. Scroll down to the Audio Codecs and Video Codecs section
of the report to review the formats supported ( see Figure   5.11 ).
6.  Close the browser tab or window.
Click to load a technical support
report into your default web browser
 Figure 5.10 
 The About Windows Media Player dialog shows 
you version information.  
 Note 
 The K and KN editions of Windows don’t include Windows Media Player. To get it for your version of 
Windows, follow the appropriate link:  
  •  Get the Media Features Pack (includes WMP) for Windows 8/8.1—  http://go.microsoft.com/
fwlink/?LinkId=260410
  •  Get the Media Features Pack (includes WMP) for Windows 7—  http://go.microsoft.com/

 If you can’t play a video or audio file with WMP, you have two options:  
•  Install the codecs you need.
•  Switch to a third-party media player.

 Figure 5.11 
 Check the name and format information for your codecs to see if they support the content you 
want to play back.   
 Tip 
 In Windows 8/8.1, Microsoft no longer provides the codecs necessary for DVD playback and has never 
included support for Blu-ray (BD) playback. If your computer doesn’t include a DVD player program, you 
can purchase the Media Center Pack with Add Features to Windows 8/8.1 (use Search to locate it).  
 If you have a Blu-ray (BD) drive and didn’t get player software with it, try Corel’s WinDVD Pro 
( www.corel.com ) or Cyberlink’s PowerDVD 13 Ultra Pro, or Power DVD Live ( www.cyberlink.com ).

 Installing Additional Codecs  
 How can you tell if you need to install additional codecs? You might need to install additional codecs 
if you do the following:  
•  Download video or audio from sources other than YouTube
 and
•  You can’t play back downloaded video or audio with Windows Media Player
 or
•  Videos play back with poor quality.
 Following are two of the major sources for free codecs:  
•  Codec Guide— www.codecguide.com , home of the K-Lite
Codec Pack
•  Shark007.net— http://shark007.net/, home of Advanced
Codecs for Windows 7 and 8
 When you install a codec pack, the codecs it contains become 
part of the listing you saw in  Figure   5.11 . 
 If you determine that a particular codec pack doesn’t work for 
you, remove it through Add/Remove Programs (or Uninstall) in 
Control Panel.  
 Alternatives to Windows Media Player  
 If you decide you’d rather try a different media player for Windows, the most common recommen-
dation is the free, open-source VLC Media Player, available from  www.videolan.org . In addition to 
playing typical media types, it can also play Flash, Video CD, DVB TV files, raw audio and DV, MIDI, 
supported formats stored in ISO image files, and many other formats.  
 Can’t View Video on Your Android Device  
 If you can’t play a particular video with the video player installed on your Android device, it’s time 
to get a new player. Some leading titles available from Google Play include the following:  
•  MX Player— Special features include hardware acceleration, support for multicore processors,
and the capability to install additional codecs when needed to play some files.  Figure   5.12 shows
a sample of its playback interface.
•  BSPlayer— Special features include the capability to use software decoding to handle file formats
not supported on your smartphone, pop-up video playback over other apps ( see Figure   5.13 ), and
add-on packages that tailor the app to particular ARM-based processors.
 Tip 
 If you need to set a particu-
lar codec as your preferred 
codec for playback, use the 
Win7DSFilterTweaker tool, 
available from  http://www.
codecguide.com/windows7_
preferred_filter_tweaker.htm .

 Playing Adobe Flash Video on Android  
 If you need Adobe Flash support for your Android device, you’ll need to try a different browser that 
has integrated Flash support, because you can no longer get current versions of Adobe Flash for 
Android. Use “browser flash player” on Google Play to find products with integrated Adobe Flash 
support.

 Can’t Play Video on Your iOS Device  
 The built-in video player included with iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad supports a limited number of 
video formats that vary by model. However, whether you have an old iPhone 4 or iPad2 or the lat-
est iPhone 5S or iPad Air, you’ll find that some of the most popular video formats, such as DiVX and 
MPEG2, aren’t supported.  
 You could convert an unsupported video file into a supported type, but it’s easier to choose a third-
party player from the App Store. There are many notable products, among them:  
•  VLC— From Video LAN Organization ( www.videolan.org/vlc/ ),
this is a free cross-platform player that features adjustments
for brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and gamma to help
improve the quality of less-than-perfect video content ( see
Figure   5.18 ). You can also adjust playback speed ( see Figure
 5.17 ) and select repeat options. It supports almost all video for-
mats and includes DropBox and Google Docs support to help
get videos onto your device.
•  Oplayer— Special features include built-in Wi-Fi transfer set-
tings ( see Figure   5.19 ), the capability to play back incomplete or damaged AVI files, and exten-
sive audio playback options ( see Figure   5.20 ). The free version is ad-supported.

CHAPTER
•  If you want Dolby audio support, look for it (many players don’t include it).
•  Most (but not all) “free” players are typically ad supported. It may be worth a few bucks to add
features and dump the ads after you find a player (or players) you like.
 Troubleshooting Codecs  
 Even after you install software so you can view RAW files or play more video files, you might still 
have problems. Check this list of problems and solutions for help:  
•  Can’t view RAW files after installing RAW codec— Try rebooting your system.
•  RAW files show up in My Computer/This PC (Windows 8) but not in Pictures— Right-click or
press and hold a RAW file and change the Open With setting from Picture Viewer to Photos. Your
RAW files should now be visible in Photos.
•  RAW files from your old digital camera can be displayed, but RAW files from your new cam-
era show up as thumbnails— You need to update your RAW codec. Check with your RAW codec
provider for an update for your camera.
•  You decide to change from the Microsoft Digital Camera Codec pack to a third-party codec
in Windows 8/8.1 but can’t remove it with Add/Remove Programs (Uninstall)— To remove the
Microsoft Digital Camera Codec pack in Windows 8/8.1, open View Installed Updates in Control
Panel, select it from the list, and click or tap Uninstall.

 Dual USB Port Charging Pitfalls  
 An increasing number of surge suppressors and third-party chargers include a pair of USB charging 
ports for use with smartphones and tablets. Unless marked otherwise, these devices typically pro-
vide a  total  of 2.1Amp. What does this mean for you? You can charge a pair of smartphones (either 
iPhone/iPod Touch, Android, or both) or a single tablet.  
 A few chargers are designed to support a smartphone and a tablet at the same time. These units 
have clearly marked 1Amp and 2.1Amp ports. These devices sometimes are marked as providing a 
total of 3.1 Amp.  
 Setting Up Your PC’s USB Ports for 
Full-Time Charging Support  
 As you learned in  Table   6.2 , you can use your computer’s USB ports to charge smartphones. 
However, you can charge your smartphone with your computer’s USB port only if the port doesn’t go 
into sleep mode.  
 If you don’t want to keep your computer on all the time to keep your smartphone charged up, but 
don’t want to use a separate charger, look for laptop or desktop computers that include USB charg-
ing support.  
 Depending on the device in question, this might be implemented as a specially marked USB port 
and might also require that the feature be enabled in the system BIOS or power management dialog, 
or that a special driver is installed.  
 Table   6.3  provides you with a quick reference to this technology as implemented by leading mother-
board and system vendors.

 If your device does not start charging, disconnect and reconnect it to the supported port.  
 Software Drivers for Faster Charging  
 If your Windows laptop or desktop doesn’t include dedicated 
USB charging ports, you can improve smartphone charging per-
formance and even add tablet charging support with most com-
puters’ USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 ports by installing the free ASUS AI 
Charger utility. It’s available from many popular download sites. 
AI Charger works by increasing charging amperage in USB ports 
to 1.2AMP.  
 Troubleshooting a Device or 
Battery That’s Not Charging  
 If you can’t charge a laptop, tablet, or smartphone, or charge a rechargeable battery, you need to 
determine which of the following is the problem:  
•  Not enough wattage or amperage from the charger
•  Defective cable
•  Defective charger
•  Defective battery
 In this section, we’ll help you figure out the solution that applies to your problem.  
 Wattage and Amperage  
 If you’re charging a smartphone or tablet, amperage (Amp) is the measure to look for. As you 
learned from  Table   6.2 , you should use a charger that matches or exceeds the amperage rating of 
the device you want to charge.  
 If you need to replace a laptop AC adapter, the measurement is in 
watts, but the principle is the same: buy an AC adapter with the 
same or higher wattage rating that will work with your laptop.  
 You don’t need to buy an adapter from your laptop vendor, by the 
way. If you’re not sure what brand your next laptop will be, or if 
 Note 
 On a Lenovo computer that supports Always On USB, the Always On USB port is yellow. Some Dell and HP 
computers use a lightning bolt marking to indicate the USB port with charging features. Check your system 
documentation to determine if this feature is supported, which port(s) support USB charging, and whether 
sufficient amperage is provided to charge tablets.  
 Tip 
 To learn which of your USB 
ports puts out the most 
power for charging USB 
devices, get a Practical Meter 
( www.practicalmeter.com ). 
It’s a USB dongle with charge 
indicator lights and a three-
headed charging cable (mini-
USB, micro-USB, and iPhone).  
 Caution 
 AC adapters made for net-
books might plug into your 
laptop, but they probably 
won’t provide enough power.

CHAPTER
you’re looking for more “bang for the buck,” choose a third-party model with interchangeable tips. 
Some laptop AC adapters now also include USB charging ports.  
 Troubleshooting Laptop Power Issues  
 If you don’t have a multimeter available, you can perform a rough “go-no go” test of your laptop’s 
AC adapter by disconnecting it from AC power and removing the battery from your laptop 
( see Figure   6.2 ). 
 Reconnect the AC adapter and turn on the laptop. If the laptop turns on, the AC adapter is OK.  
 In addition to finding out what wattage rating your laptop AC adapter has, the second reason to 
look at the label on the AC adapter is to determine its output voltage and polarity. You need this 
information if you want to test your AC adapter or to buy a third-party replacement. In  Figure   6.3 , 
the laptop AC adapter is designed to output 19V DC. The positive connection is in the middle of the 
plug, and the negative connection is the outside of the plug. 
 If the laptop cannot run without the battery while plugged into an AC outlet, check the following:  
•  Make sure the laptop is plugged into a working AC outlet. Use a lamp or clock radio to determine
if the AC outlet is working. You can also use a portable outlet tester, a voltmeter or a multimeter
set to AC voltage to determine if the output is within acceptable limits.
•  Make sure the AC power cord running from the AC outlet to the external AC adapter “power
brick” is plugged completely into the outlet and the adapter. If the power cord or plug is dam-
aged, replace the cord.

•  To determine whether the adapter is outputting the correct DC voltage, use a voltmeter or multi-
meter set to DC voltage to test the voltage coming from the adapter and compare it to the nomi-
nal output values marked on the adapter. As  Figure   6.4 illustrates, it might be necessary to use a
bent paper clip to enable an accurate voltage reading. A value of +/–5% is acceptable.

CHAPTER
 Smartphone or Tablet Cable or Charger?  
 If you can’t charge your smartphone or tablet with the recommended charger, the problem could be 
the charger or the cable. Because these types of chargers are difficult to test, follow this procedure:  
1.  Make sure the charger is plugged into a working AC wall outlet or a surge suppressor that is
turned on.
2.  Swap the original cable for another cable (preferably a known-working cable, or a brand-new
cable if a known-working replacement is not available). If the device now charges, recycle the old
cable and use the replacement cable. If the device still won’t charge, proceed to step 3.
3.  Swap the original charger for another charger (preferably known-working, or a new one if a
known-working charger is not available) and use the original cable. If the device now charges,
recycle the old charger and use the replacement charger. If the device still won’t charge, proceed
to step 4.
4.  If the battery in the smartphone or tablet can be removed, remove it, wipe off the contacts, and
replace it. Retry the charging process. If the device still won’t charge, replace the battery or have
the unit serviced.
 Battery Testing  
 You can use any of the following methods to test a battery. Choose the best method for your 
situation: 
•  Use a multimeter set to the battery’s voltage (DC current). Check the battery’s markings to deter-
mine positive (+) and negative (–) terminals. The red lead from the multimeter goes to the posi-
tive terminal; the black to the negative terminal.
•  Use a self-contained battery tester set to the battery’s voltage. See  Figure   6.5 .
•  Use the battery in a compatible device.
 For the first test, a battery fails if it doesn’t provide output at the 
rated voltage. For the second test (see  Figure   6.5 ), a battery fails if 
it doesn’t move the needle into the Good zone. For the third test, a 
battery fails if the device won’t turn on.  
 If a rechargeable battery fails, recharge it. If it won’t take a charge 
or runs out of power after just a few minutes or a few photos, 
recycle it. If a throwaway battery (alkaline or lithium) fails, replace 
it. Dispose of it according to local regulations.  
 Note 
 Check the battery’s markings 
to determine positive (+) and 
negative (–) terminals. The 
red lead from the multimeter 
or battery tester goes to the 
positive terminal; the black to 
the negative terminal.

 Battery Not Charging or Not Holding a Charge  
 If a device works when plugged into AC power, but not on battery power, check the following:  
•  Make sure that the battery is installed properly.
•  Wipe off any corrosion or dirt on the battery and battery contacts.
•  Determine whether the battery can hold a charge. Make sure the battery is properly installed and
the AC adapter has proper DC voltage output levels. Leave the device plugged in for the recom-
mended amount of time needed to charge the battery, and then try to run the device on battery
power. If the battery cannot run the system at all, or if the device runs out of battery power very
quickly, replace the battery (if it is user replaceable). If replacing the battery does not solve the
problem, or if the battery is built in to the device, the device  needs to be serviced or replaced.
•  If the battery is hot after being charged or has a warped exterior, it might have an internal short.

buying mistakes easy to commit. To help your device work as well (or better) than it did before, fol-
low these suggestions.  
 Rechargeable AA/AAA/C/D Batteries  
 If you’re tired of shelling out for AA, AAA, C, or D batteries for your electronic devices, the first 
question to ask is “rechargeable or disposable?” Here’s why that question isn’t as easy to answer 
as you might think:  
 Although rechargeable batteries can be recharged hundreds of times, you can’t always replace alka-
line or lithium batteries with rechargeables. The number one reason is voltage output: a single AA, 
AAA, C, or D-cell alkaline or lithium battery provides 1.5V DC power, whereas a single rechargeable 
NiMh battery provides 1.2–1.25V DC power. If a device isn’t designed to use the lower voltage pro-
vided by rechargeable batteries, it might not work at all, or it might work erratically.  
 Before you decide to try rechargeable batteries, check the device’s instruction manual. Buy just one 
set of rechargeable batteries and a charger, charge the batteries, and use them in the device. If the 
results are satisfactory, buy a second set. If not, the device is not compatible with rechargeable bat-
teries. 
 When you select rechargeable batteries, look carefully at the mAh rating: the higher the rating, the 
longer your batteries will last per charge. mAh ratings can vary a great deal between batteries, as 
shown in  Figure   6.6 .

Keeping Devices Powered Up
164
 Alkaline Versus Lithium Batteries  
 Even if you decide that rechargeable batteries are the way to go, it still makes sense to have a set of 
throwaway batteries in reserve in case you forget to recharge your batteries. What should you buy 
to keep your electronics happy?  
 Rule number 1: If it isn’t an alkaline or lithium battery, forget it. It might be tempting to pick up a 
package of “heavy duty” or “super heavy duty” batteries because they’re cheap. However, alkaline 
and lithium batteries last much longer in service.  
 Rule number 2: Any alkaline battery will do in low-drain applications, such as remote controls or 
flashlights in storage. However, when used in electronic flash units, digital cameras, or similar high-
drain applications, you’re better off with high-end alkaline or, better still, lithium batteries.  
 Rule number 3: For longest use time with high-drain digital devices, use lithium batteries.  
 Rule number 4: If your device recommends different types of batteries for different conditions (such 
as an outdoor weather sensor), be sure to use the battery type(s) recommended for the conditions in 
which you use the device.  
 Proprietary Laptop, Digital Camera, or Camcorder 
Batteries  
 If you’ve been accustomed to buying off-the-shelf AA batteries for a low-cost digital camera or cam-
corder, be prepared for sticker shock when you price proprietary rechargeable batteries for laptops, 
cameras, and camcorders. If you buy from the camera vendor, you might pay $50–$60 or more for a 
single battery. An OEM laptop battery can cost $30–$40.  
 However, you don’t need to pay that much. Many third-party vendors produce plug-compatible 
rechargeable batteries that sell for considerably less. In some cases, you can buy replacement bat-
teries with a higher mAh rating, resulting in more shots per charge ( see Figure   6.7 ). 
 Note 
 Examples of low-end alkaline batteries include most private-label alkaline batteries, Varta Energy, Varta 
Longlife, Kodak Xtralife, and Eveready Gold (made by Energizer). Mid-range alkaline batteries include 
Duracell Coppertop, RayOVac Ready Power, Energizer Max, Kodak MAX, CVS MAX, and Varta High Energy. 
High-end alkaline batteries include Duracell Quantum, Kodak Ultra, RayOVac Advanced High Energy, Varta 
MaxTech, and Varta Professional Alkaline.  
 Note 
 The greater the number of cells in a laptop or netbook battery, the longer the run time per charge—and 
the greater the cost. Typical laptop batteries contain six cells, while so-called “long-life” or “extended-life” 
batteries typically feature nine cells. Once again, you can achieve significant savings by buying third-party 
replacements.

Extending Battery Life

CHAPTER
 Built-in Batteries  
 If your device uses a built-in battery, such as an Apple portable device, you will need to have the 
unit serviced if the battery fails. If you are considering buying a refurbished iPod, iPad, or iPhone, 
keep in mind that Apple’s refurbishing process includes replacing the battery. Third-party refurbish-
ing typically does not.  
 Extending Battery Life  
 To extend battery life in any device, follow these suggestions:  
•  Use the lowest level of screen brightness that works for you.
•  If you can adjust the amount of time your device’s LCD displays stays on, reduce it if it stays on
when you’re not using it.
•  Close your laptop to put it into sleep mode.
•  Close apps you’re not using them.
•  Keep your device away from extremely hot or extremely cold environments; batteries, like
devices, work best at room temperature.

 What Bad Power Does to Your System  
 If you’re planning a system upgrade, it’s likely that your power supply is not on the list. After all, it 
doesn’t  appear  to affect a system’s performance or features. But appearances can be deceiving. Bad 
power supplies can cause a lot of grief. A lot of the problems PC users experience that get blamed 
on memory, Windows, and so on can all be traced to a faulty or poor-quality power supply. Sadly, 
the power supply is often the first component most PC vendors attempt to skimp on.  
 What can a bad power supply do to your system? It prevents your computer from running reliably, 
can cause bus-powered USB and IEEE-1394 devices to be unreliable, and can even cause the com-
puter to reboot spontaneously or fail to boot at all. The trouble is, a bad power supply isn’t the only 
PC component that can cause these kinds of problems: bad device drivers, overclocking your system 
past its limits, and Windows errors can also cause these symptoms.  
 In this chapter, we’ll put on our deerstalker caps, grab our magnifying glasses, and turn amateur 
detectives to determine if you have a defective power supply. You’ll learn how to protect your power 
supply and how to replace your power supply with the right model for your needs.  
 Keep in mind that a “power supply” doesn’t contain a small atomic reactor or any other true source 
of power. Instead, power supplies convert potentially deadly high-voltage AC wall current into safe 
low-voltage DC power. A byproduct of the transforming process is heat; hence, a desktop PC’s 
power supply contains a built-in fan, which pulls air through the power supply to dissipate heat and 
help cool the system. Laptop computers work a little differently—they typically use an external

CHAPTER
“briquette” transformer to turn AC into DC power. Consequently, the laptop’s power supply is 
responsible for fiddling the DC power coming into  the unit into the various voltage levels needed for 
drive motors, cooling fans, and chips.  
 Now that you understand what a power supply is—and what it does—it’s time to find out what 
makes one conk out.  
 Determining Whether Your Power Supply 
Is Overloaded or Failing  
 A power supply that can’t provide the power needed by your computer is often called an  overloaded 
power supply. What does that mean?  
 The motherboard, memory modules, CPU, fans, USB ports, and IEEE-1394 ports built in to your sys-
tem all require power. Power supplies are rated in terms of output voltage, amps, and wattage. So, 
what happens if your power supply doesn’t provide enough power to drive your devices?  
 If your power supply doesn’t have a high enough wattage rating (larger is better) to handle the 
power needs of your computer and the components plugged into it, the power supply will wear out 
prematurely. (Remember, any time you add to the components in your PC, you increase the load on 
your power supply.) Here are some of the symptoms to look for.  
 Overheating 
 As you learned in  Chapter   1 , ”PC, Tablet, Mobile Device, Home Theater, Digital Camera, and 
Camcorder Anatomy 101,” the power supply on a desktop computer is located at the rear of the 
case. When the system is running, the power supply is normally warm to the touch. However, if it is 
too hot to touch, the power supply may be overloaded (too high a wattage drain) or the power sup-
ply or system fans may have failed.  
 Bus-Powered USB Devices Are Failing  
 USB devices are powered in one of two ways:  
•  Self-powered— The device has its own power supply.
•  Bus-powered— The device draws power from the port.
 Self-powered devices use only a small fraction of the power available from a port, whereas bus-
powered devices can use most or all of the power available from a port. USB 1.1/2.0 root hubs (ports 
built into a computer) provide 500mA of power per port, and USB 3.0 root hubs provide 900mA of 
power per port.  Figure   7.1 illustrates typical current draws for a range of USB devices.  
 What types of devices are bus-powered? Keyboards, mice, and other types of pointing devices are 
bus-powered, but these devices typically use 100mA or less. However, bus-powered flash memory 
drives and hard disk drives can use up to 500mA.  
 If you need to plug and unplug a USB device two or more times before it is detected by the system, 
especially if it is bus-powered, this can be a sign of an overloaded power supply.

 Not Enough 12V Power  
 Until a few years ago, power supplies provided similar levels of +5V and +12V DC power. Originally, 
+12V DC power was used to power fans and drive motors. However, in recent years +12V DC power
has also been used to provide power for processors and for PCIe video cards. As a result, a power
supply that appears to have sufficient power in terms of its wattage rating might not have enough
+12V DC power for current systems.  Figure   7.2 compares the labels for two power supplies of simi-
lar wattage.

CHAPTER
 As you can see, the power supply with the lower wattage rating (430) actually has much more +12V 
DC power (34 Amps versus 20 Amps). Thus, it provides more of the power needed by modern sys-
tems. If you use a power supply with an inadequate amount of +12V DC power, adding additional 
hard disks, SSDs, optical drives, fans, a faster processor, or a PCIe video card that requires a +12V 
DC power connector could overload the +12V DC line and cause your system to lock up or crash.

 Low Efficiency  
 Power supplies never provide 100% efficiency. In other words, a power supply always draws more 
current than it provides. For a power supply to provide its rated wattage, it must draw enough cur-
rent from the AC wall outlet to provide that power. The higher the efficiency, the less additional 
power is needed. However, the excess power used is minimized when a more efficient power sup-
ply is used. Using a more efficient power supply helps minimize heat buildup (excess current is dis-
sipated as heat) and also helps reduce utility costs.  
 For example, the 430-watt power supply shown in  Figure  7.2 b has an 80% efficiency rating. To 
achieve 430-watt output (in other words, a 100% load), it needs to draw 537.5 watts:  
 430 watts / 0.80 = 537.5  
 What about the power supply shown in  Figure   7.2 a ? It lacks an efficiency rating, but a general rule 
is to assume a rating of between 63% and 70% for typical unrated power supplies.  
 If we assume 63% efficiency, our 500 watt power supply needs to 
draw about 794 watts at full load:  
 500 watts / 0.63 = 793.65  
 If we assume 70% efficiency, the current draw would be 714 
watts at full load:  
 500 watts / 0.7 = 714.28  
 As you can see, the 80PLUS power supply in this example draws 
less current at full load and provides more +12V DC power, the 
most important power level, than the older power supply.  
 Random System Crashes or Lockups  
 Microsoft Windows is very sensitive to power problems. An overloaded or overheated power supply 
can cause Windows STOP errors (also known as the Blue Screen of Death) at random intervals.  
 If your system locks up, freezes, or restarts when playing a 3D game, your power supply may be 
overloaded on its +12V DC power rail, especially if the video card you’re using requires its own 
power cable.  
 Troubleshooting Overheating and Airflow 
Problems  
 Although an overloaded power supply can cause the power supply to become very hot, other prob-
lems inside the case can cause overheating issues as well. Before assuming you need a new power 
supply, check these issues first:  
•  Make sure the air intakes on the computer case, the air intakes into the power supply, the power
supply fan, and the exhaust are clean and free of obstructions.
•  Make sure the power supply fan is turning at full speed; if the power supply has a fan facing
inside the system, make sure it is turning as well. If the power supply fan has failed, replace the

power supply. If the power supply has a monitoring lead that connects to the motherboard, you 
can check the system BIOS’s hardware monitor or run software supplied by the motherboard or 
system maker to see if the fan is running at the proper speed.  
•  If your system uses ribbon cables (used for floppy drives or PATA drives), fold or cable-tie drive
ribbon cables inside the case to prevent them from blocking airflow. You can also replace flat
cables with pre-rounded cables available from many vendors. Another option is to purchase split-
loom or braided-cable sleeving and then fit your PATA and floppy cables into them, securing
them with cable ties. This will both increase airflow inside the case and give your case a custom
look. Various kinds of cable sleeves can be purchased at computer mod websites or at automo-
tive websites.
•  If case fans are not turning, make sure they are properly plugged into the motherboard or a
four-pin (Molex) power connector. If the fan can’t be turned by hand, it has failed and should be
replaced.
•  If the fans are turning, make sure they are properly installed. Fans at the front or sides of the
case should be installed to pull air into the case, while fans at the back of the case should be
installed to push air out of the case.
 Has Your Power Supply Failed?  
 There are several indications that your power supply has failed, but some of them can also be 
caused by other problems. In other words, don’t assume you need a new power supply until you 
check the other causes.  
 System Won’t Turn On  
 If you can’t get your computer to start up, don’t panic! Before you assume that your power supply is 
pushing up daisies, check the following:  
•  The computer might not be plugged in.
•  The surge suppressor the computer is plugged into might be turned off.
•  The power switch on the rear of some power supplies might be turned off (not all power supplies
have this switch). Refer to  Figure   1.5 ( Chapter   1 ) or 7.15.
•  You might have the wrong input voltage selected on the rear of the power supply. Refer to
 Figure   1.5  ( Chapter   1 ).
•  The wiring from the case’s on/off switch might not be properly connected to the correct jumpers
on the motherboard. Refer to  Figure   1.15 ( Chapter   1 ).
•  The power connectors to the motherboard might not be properly connected. Some motherboards
require you to connect the ATX12V connectors as well as the primary connector to the mother-
board for adequate power.
•  You might have an internal short that shuts down the power supply as soon as you start the system.
•  The motherboard has a “Guardian” function that prevents you from starting the computer unless
a working processor fan is plugged into a particular jack.

 You’re probably using a surge suppressor between your computer and the wall outlet, so don’t 
ignore the possibility that the surge suppressor is turned off or has failed. If the computer runs 
when you plug it into a wall outlet but won’t work when you plug it into a surge suppressor that’s 
turned on, look for a reset button on the surge suppressor and press it. If the surge suppressor 
doesn’t have a reset button, or it still doesn’t work after you try it, the suppressor is dead and needs 
to be replaced.  
 Power Supply Comes On for a Moment, Then Stops  
 Your system probably has an internal short if it turns on for a couple of seconds and then stops. 
Internal shorts can be caused by any of the following:  
•  Loose screws inside the computer case
•  Defective components in the power supply
•  Bare wires on the power supply cables or splitter/extensions (which extend or split one 4-pin
drive connector to service two devices)
•  Damaged add-on cards
•  Damaged components plugged into the power supply, such as drives, video cards, or fans
 Figure   7.3  illustrates some of these potential problems.

CHAPTER
 To check for loose screws, use this procedure:  
1.  Shut down the system and turn off the power supply if it has an external switch
(refer to  Figure   1.5 or 7.15).
2.  Unplug the AC power cord.
3.  Open the system.
4.  Pick up and shake the system gently while you listen for loose screws.
5.  Remove any loose screws.
6.  Plug the AC power cord back in.
7.  Turn the power supply on.
8.  Try to restart your computer.
 If it restarts, hooray! Turn it off, close it up, and get back to business.  
 To check for shorts caused by bare wires or bad power splitters, follow a similar procedure, but at 
step 4, look for bare wires or poorly constructed Y-splitters (used to split one power source into two). 
Disconnect any of these you find in step 5, and proceed.  Don’t disconnect a power splitter that runs 
your CPU fan—you can (depending on the kind of CPU) fry your CPU in seconds if it’s not cooled!  
 If disconnecting a Y-splitter or device with a bare wire solves the problem, replace the splitter or 
device. If a replacement is not available, use electrical tape to cover the bare wire and see if the 
computer will start. Get a replacement as soon as you can. 
 To check for shorts caused by bad drives, select a drive that is not using a Y-splitter in step 4 and 
disconnect it from the power supply in step 5 (you can leave the drive connected to its data cable). 
If the drive uses a Y-splitter, connect it directly to the power supply. If the system works when you 
bypass the Y-splitter, replace the Y-splitter. If the system will not start with a particular drive con-
nected to the power, replace the drive.  
 One hidden benefit of upgrading to a large-wattage power supply is the greater number of drive 
connectors built in to the new power supply.  
 To check for shorts caused by bad add-on cards, remove all add-on cards in step 4 and jump to step 
6. If the system starts, replace one card at a time until the system stops working. Replace the card
that caused the system to fail.
 System Reboots Itself  
 If your system reboots itself, there are two possible causes:  
•  A STOP error in Windows if the system is configured to restart automatically. To learn how to
keep a STOP error on-screen, see “Preparing a Windows-based Computer or Tablet for Easier
Troubleshooting,” in  Chapter   1 . To learn more about STOP errors, see “STOP (BlueScreen) Errors
at Startup,” in  Chapter   8 , “Fixing Windows Devices that Can’t Start.”
•  A problem with the Power Good line in the main power cable running from the power supply to
the motherboard. To determine if your power supply’s Power Good line is providing correct volt-
age, use a power tester that checks the Power Good line, or use a multimeter. A multimeter is a
multifunction electrical device tester. To learn more about how to use a multimeter, see “Using a
Multimeter,” in this chapter.

176
 Power Supply Fan Fails  
 Most power supplies have a fan that pulls air through the power supply to help keep it cool, while 
some also have a fan that faces into the computer’s interior. If either fan fails, replace the power 
supply. 
 Power Supply Smells  
 When you smell a burnt or acrid smell coming from your computer, it’s never good news. These 
smells indicate a component failure. And, if it’s your power supply that smells, its failure could 
destroy your motherboard and other components connected to it (I lost a hard disk and a USB key-
board when my power supply failed).  
 A simple rule is this: a smelly power supply means it’s time to shop for a new one.  
 Testing Your Power Supply  
 Because a defective motherboard or other component can cause your power supply to appear to be 
defective, it’s a really good idea to test the power supply in isolation from the motherboard, fans, 
and drives. Here’s how.  
 Using a Digital Power Supply Tester 
 A digital power supply tester enables you to test your system’s power supply for basic opera-
tion and to determine proper voltage levels. In this example, we’ll use the Dr. Power II tester from 
Thermaltake, but similar testers are available from many vendors.  
 Here’s how to use the tester to test an installed power supply:  
1.  Turn off the power supply.
2.  Unplug the power supply from AC power.
3.  Open the computer case.
4.  Disconnect the power supply from the motherboard, drives, and fans.
 Note 
 The “Power Good” line is monitored by the motherboard. If the power level on this line goes below 3V DC 
or above 6V DC, the motherboard restarts the computer.  
 Caution 
 Even if you think you can replace the power supply’s fan yourself, don’t risk it. Capacitors inside power sup-
plies retain potentially lethal levels of electricity for considerable amounts of time after a power supply is 
disconnected from a power source.  

177
Testing Your Power Supply

CHAPTER
5.  Connect the motherboard power connector from the power supply to the tester.
6.  Plug the power supply into AC power.
7.  Turn on the power supply.
8.  Turn on the tester. If the power supply starts and indicates the power supply works, the power
supply is okay (see  Figure   7.4 ). If the power supply doesn’t start, replace it. If the power supply
starts but the indicator displays a problem, replace the power supply (see  Figure   7.5 ).
 This particular power supply tester checks voltage levels as well as basic power functionality. Some 
power supply testers, such as the one shown in  Figure   7.6 , check on/off functionality only.  
 If your tester doesn’t check voltage, you can use these methods to make sure your power supply is 
putting out the correct power levels:  
•  Using the PC Health or Hardware Monitor feature in the system BIOS
•  Using a multimeter
 Both of these methods are covered in detail later in this chapter.

CHAPTER
 Ideal and Acceptable Voltage Levels  
 As you can see from the voltage levels shown on the power supply labels in  Figure   7.2 , your com-
puter uses four DC voltage lines: +5, +12, –5, and –12. A fifth line, Power Good, provides a signal 
that is used to determine that the power supply is working.  
 Whether you use a self-contained power tester, the PC Health or System Monitor feature in the 
system BIOS or as displayed by a utility provided by your motherboard vendor, or a multimeter, the 
voltages your system needs for reliable power are those shown in  Table   7.2 . If your power supply 
doesn’t provide power within these limits, replace it.

 Note that Power Good (which reboots your system if it is not within the specified values) is not dis-
played by BIOS or software-based system monitors.  
 Checking Voltage Levels with PC Health/Hardware 
Monitor  
 If you’re uncomfortable with opening up your system to check the power supply and your system 
starts, you can use the PC Health or Hardware Monitor feature built in to the system BIOS in your 
computer. When you start your computer, press the appropriate key to start the System BIOS pro-
gram. Depending on the system, this information might be displayed as soon as you start the BIOS 
program ( see Figure   7.7  ), or you might need to navigate to a System Monitor or PC Health dialog 
( see Figure   7.8   ).  
 Using a Multimeter  
 If you already have a digital multimeter, you can use it to test voltage levels and Power Good. A 
digital multimeter can also be used to test AC wall outlet voltage, check cable continuity, and check 
resistance; expect to pay at least $20 for a typical unit, such as the autoranging model shown in 
 Figure   7.10  . 
 So, what are you checking?

Testing Your Power Supply

CHAPTER
 Figure   7.9   shows the pinouts used by the 20-pin and 24-pin ATX power supply connectors. The 
24-pin ATX power supply pinout is also used by the power supplies used by small-form factor and
thin PCs.
 How can you test your power supply while the system is running? Follow this procedure:  
1.  Shut down the computer and unplug AC power from the power supply.
2.  Open the computer case and locate the power connector.
 Figure 7.9 
 The 24-pin ATX12V v2.x power supply pinout (bot-
tom) is based on the 20-pin ATX power supply pin-
out (top). This pinout shows the top view of the 
connectors as they attach to the motherboard.  
 Caution 
 Some Dell desktop computers use proprietary versions of the ATX power supply. These power supplies route 
3.3V DC lines to an additional connector. If you are checking a Dell computer and the power supply line 
colors and pattern do not resemble those shown in  Figure   7.9 , your system has a proprietary power supply. 
You will need to look up the service manual for that model and use the listed pinouts to check voltages. If 
the power supply is defective, you will need to order one from Dell or buy a third-party model that uses the 
Dell proprietary pinout. For some  examples, see  http://www.smps.us/dell_pinout.png . 
 If you mix Dell proprietary and standard ATX motherboards and power supplies, you get smoke, possibly 
fire, and a ruined system for sure. See “Upgrading Power Supplies in Dell Computers,” p.186, this chapter 
for help in replacing a proprietary Dell power supply.

3.  Turn on your multimeter and set it for DC power.
4.  Plug in the power supply computer.
5.  Turn on the power supply.
6.  Turn on the computer.
7.  Check Power Good, +5V, –5V, +12V, and –12V voltage levels by back probing: insert the red lead
into the top of the power connector to touch the metal connector inside, and touch the black lead
to a ground such as the case frame or power supply case (see  Figure   7.10 ).
8.  Check the readings against those shown in  Table   7.2 . If you see a rating that falls outside the
range listed, the power supply is defective and should be replaced.
 Replacing the Power Supply  
 The power supply you’re replacing might have been adequate for your needs when you bought (or 
built) your computer, but it’s likely that your next power supply needs to be better than your origi-
nal. Here’s what to look for.

CHAPTER
 Essential and Desirable Features  
 Your power supply needs these features:  
•  Safety rating for your country or region
•  Power connectors for your internal devices
•  Adequate wattage for your devices
 These features aren’t essential, but provide additional performance and flexibility:  
•  Modular power cables
•  80PLUS efficiency ratings
  Safety Ratings  
 Although you can buy very low-cost power supplies that lack UL 
or other safety ratings, these power supplies can ruin your system. 
You should never use a power supply that doesn’t have safety 
ratings from an authority such as CSA (Canada), UL (USA), TÜV 
(Germany), or CE (European Union).  
  Enough Power Connectors for Your Devices 
 Your new power supply should feature the power connectors needed by your current hardware and 
any upgrades you’re planning. If your current power supply needs splitters to provide power for 
devices such as PCIe x16 video cards or SATA drives, make sure your new power supply includes 
these connectors in sufficient quantity for your hardware.  Figure   7.11 illustrates typical connectors 
on high-quality new power supplies.  
 Note 
 On a UL-listed power supply, 
the UL marking is a back-
wards UR (the UL marking for 
components).

  Adequate Wattage  
 Your new power supply should include a higher wattage rating than the existing one. You can cal-
culate the power supply needed by using the estimators available at many power supply vendors’ 
websites. For details, see “Selecting the Right-Sized Power Supply,” later in this chapter.  
  Modular Power Cables  
 Traditional PC power supplies include a tangled nest of cables for drives, additional 12V power, and 
PCIe video cards. To help make cable management easier, many power supplies now feature modu-
lar designs. With a modular power supply such as the one in  Figure   7.12 , you can plug in only the 
cables you need for the devices included in your system.  
  80PLUS Rating  
 A power supply with an 80PLUS rating is typically more efficient than a power supply that lacks this 
rating. I recommend using only 80PLUS power supplies. For details, see “Understanding 80PLUS 
Standards,” later in this chapter.

CHAPTER
 Selecting the Right-Sized Power Supply  
 Whether you’re replacing your system’s power supply because it’s overloaded or to provide support 
for newer technologies (such as PCIe x16 video cards and SATA drives), you should make sure your 
power supply can handle the devices it’s supposed to power.  
 Some manufacturers provide a quick-reference guide to typical system configurations and the power 
supply size recommended. For example, PC Power and Cooling’s Power Supply Selector is available 
at  http://www.pcpower.com/Power_Supply_Selector.html . 
 However, if you want a tool that helps you find the specifications you can use to shop for power 
supplies from any vendor, I recommend the Extreme Outer Vision eXtreme Power Supply Calculator 
available at  http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalculator.jsp . The Lite version is free, and the Pro 
version, which includes amperage values, is just $7.99 for lifetime (up to 200 years) access. I rec-
ommend this version for overclocked systems, systems that include two or more high-performance 
video cards, or systems that use third-party air cooling or water cooling.  
 With either version, select the CPU (brand, type, speed), video cards, number of drives, number of 
memory modules, and other components, and click Calculate for a wattage calculation and power 
supply recommendation.  Figure   7.13 shows a calculation made for a system with a high-perfor-
mance Intel processor, two NVIDIA graphics cards, and other advanced features. The recommended 
power supply size is at least 687 watts, and the calculator suggests 750 watt (or larger) power sup-
plies for this configuration.

 Understanding 80PLUS Standards  
 80PLUS power supplies are more expensive than nonrated power supplies, so you might be wonder-
ing if the extra cost is worth it. Here’s why they’re better:  
•  Any 80PLUS-certified power supply provides at least 80% efficiency at 100% load. There are
several levels of 80PLUS ratings.  Figure   7.14   gives you the efficiency ratings for the entire family
when 115V AC current is used (230V AC efficiencies are a bit higher).
•  All 80PLUS-certified power supplies feature active power factor correction (Active PFC) for bet-
ter efficiency. Active PFC improves the quality of power by putting voltage and current in phase
with each other.
 80PLUS-certified power supplies are available from a variety of retail and online vendors.  
 Upgrading Power Supplies in Dell Computers  
 Some Dell computers built since 1998 use a nonstandard version of the ATX connector with com-
pletely different wiring than standard. If you attempt to install a standard ATX power supply into a 
Dell system that uses a nonstandard (proprietary) power supply, you could fry the power supply or 
motherboard! Dell moved the +3.3V DC (orange) connectors out of the 20/24 pin ATX power 
connector to a proprietary connectors. The pinouts differ in voltage and pin assignments. See  
http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=339053  for details.  
 Tip 
 To determine the processor brand, model, speed, video card type, and other information about your sys-
tem, you can use the Windows MSInfo32.exe utility. The System Summary page lists the processor brand, 
model number, and speed, as well as physical memory installed. The video card information is viewed by 
clicking Components, Display.  
 For more detailed information about your system, download and run the free SiSoftware SANDRA Lite 
utility available at  www.sisoftware.net .

 Your options? Some vendors sell adapters that convert a standard 24-pin ATX power supply 
to the wiring standard used by some Dell models. See  http://www.atxpowersupplies.com/
Dell-24-to-24-16-adapter.php for such an adapter and a partial list of supported models.  
 Alternatively, you can buy a Dell-specific power supply from either Dell’s parts department or a 
third-party equivalent from some vendors. For example, see  http://www.amazon.com/
StarTech-PW400DELL-Replacement-Computer-Supply/dp/B000LRL1QO/ref=pd_sxp_grid_pt_0_0 . 
This page also includes a list of compatible Dell computer models.  
 Removing the Old Power Supply  
 After you have purchased your replacement power supply, it’s time to remove the old one. Follow 
this procedure:  
1.  Shut down your computer.
2.  Turn off the old power supply.
3.  Disconnect AC power from the old power supply.
4.  Remove the side of the case to get access to the power supply. To figure out which side to
remove, take a look at the port cluster on the rear of the system. Remove the side away from the
port cluster (typically the right side as viewed from the rear; the left side as viewed from the
front).
5.  Carefully remove all power cables from the cards, drives, and motherboard. SATA, Molex, and
floppy cables are not locked in place. However, PCIe, ATX main, and ATX12V cables are locked
in place: push the locking tab to remove them (refer to  Figure   7.11 ).
6.  Remove the screws (typically four) that hold the power supply in place ( see Figure   7.15 ). If the
power supply is on the top of the system, hold it in place as you remove the screws.
7.  Slide the power supply out of the system.

 Installing the New Power Supply  
 To install your new power supply, follow this procedure:  
1.  Turn off the power supply before installation.
2.  If the new power supply has a voltage selector switch, set it to the correct voltage.
3.  Slide the new power supply into the system. If it has a fan that faces into the computer, make
sure the fan faces the interior ( see Figure   7.16 ).
4.  Fasten the power supply in place with the retaining screws provided (or reuse the screws from
the old power supply). If the power supply is top mounted, hold it in place until all screws are
secure.
5.  If the power supply is modular, connect the cables needed for your devices (refer to  Figure   7.12 ).
6.  Connect power leads from the power supply to the motherboard, drives, fans, and cards.
7.  Plug the AC power cord into the power supply.
8.  Turn on the power supply.
9.  Restart the computer.

CHAPTER
 If the system starts properly, shut down the computer, turn off and unplug the power supply, close 
up the system, and repeat steps 7–9. You’re finished!  
 If the system doesn’t start, check the connections to the motherboard and drives.  
 Choosing Power Protection Devices  
 You probably don’t connect your computer, monitor, printers, scanners, and external drives directly 
to your AC wall outlets—and that’s good! Most homes and offices don’t have nearly enough electri-
cal outlets for the increasing number of PC-related hardware connected to modern systems. You 
probably use a multiple-outlet device called a  surge suppressor  or  surge protector . When was the 
last time you changed it, or even thought about it?  
 Some so-called surge suppressors aren’t very good, and most of the models you can buy at retail 
stores can wear out over time. If you depend on a worn-out surge suppressor to protect your com-
puter, you might get an unpleasant surprise the next time a power surge happens.

 Your computer needs reliable, high-quality power. To make sure you achieve that goal, a complete 
powerline-protection strategy should include the following: 
•  Checking wall outlets for proper wiring
•  Using surge suppressors with filtering, wiring-fault warning, and high levels of protection
against surges and spikes for all AC-connected equipment
•  Isolating electrically noisy devices such as laser printers from computers or other devices by
using surge suppressors with separate filter banks or separate surge suppressors for the printer
and other devices
•  Using a battery backup system for your computer and monitor if your area is subject to frequent
electrical blackouts (complete loss of power) or brownouts (voltage sags below 100V AC).
 Now that you have an overview, let’s cover the details.  
 Checking Wall Outlets  
 The polarized and grounded design used by wall outlets today is intended to provide high-quality 
power to your computer and peripherals and other devices in your home or office. However, all too 
often, incorrect wiring is present, regardless of whether the wiring was performed by professional 
or do-it-yourself electricians. If you don’t determine that the wiring is correct, you could damage 
your computer or, at least, decrease its reliability by plugging it into an improperly wired outlet. 
Although some surge suppressors feature a single signal light to indicate if your wiring has a fault 
or is correct, such units don’t  provide enough information to help you fix the problem. 
 Fortunately, it’s not difficult or expensive to test your electrical outlets for such problems as incor-
rect grounding and reversed hot/neutral polarity. You can purchase an outlet tester similar to the 
one shown in  Figure   7.17 from many electronics and home-improvement stores for less than $10. 
The signal lights on the tester indicate whether the outlet is wired properly, or if it’s wired incor-
rectly, what type of wiring fault is present. Testers include a chart (often attached to the unit, as 
shown in  Figure   7.17 ) indicating the meaning of the signal lights.  
 If you live or work in an older building without three-wire grounded electrical outlets, you’re asking 
for trouble with your computer. Using three-prong to two-prong adapters is definitely not recom-
mended, even if you attach a ground wire to a good earth ground (such as a metal water pipe). Have 
your home office rewired with modern electrical cable attached to ground and put in three-prong 
outlets. 

191

CHAPTER
 Choosing a Surge Suppression Device  
 The two types of power problems a properly designed surge suppressor can handle are spikes and 
surges. 
 Both spikes and surges are overvoltage events: voltage levels higher than the normal voltage levels 
that come out of the wall socket. Spikes are momentary overvoltages, whereas surges last longer. 
Both can damage or destroy equipment.  
 Surge suppressors seem to multiply like rabbits; every store that carries computer equipment offers 
a huge number of models from different vendors. It’s tempting either to go with the cheapest model 
to save a few bucks or buy the most expensive model—after all, don’t you get what you pay for? 
However, getting the right surge suppressor isn’t that easy.  
 You can make sure you get the right surge suppressor by looking for the following features:  
•  Make sure you’re looking at a true surge suppressor, which has a UL-1449 rating, and not a
multiple-outlet strip (UL-1363 transient voltage tap rating). Some stores and product vendors
don’t adequately mark their products, so it can be easy to mix up these different types of devices.
If you can’t find this information on the unit or its packaging, look at the unit’s instruction
manual. The Technical Information section typically lists this information.

•  The surge suppressor should have a low UL-1449 let-through voltage level (400V AC or less;
330V AC is the lowest available). This might seem high compared to the standard line voltages
(115V or 230V), but computer power supplies have been tested to handle up to 500V AC without
damage.
•  A fast response (under 1 nanosecond) to surges helps prevent damage to equipment.
•  A high Joule rating. Joules measure electrical energy, and surge suppressors with higher Joule
ratings can dissipate greater levels of surges or spikes and can provide protection longer than
suppressors with lower ratings.
•  A covered-equipment warranty that includes lightning strikes (one of the biggest causes of
surges and spikes).
•  A fuse or failsafe feature that prevents fatal surges from getting through and shuts down the
unit permanently when the unit can no longer provide protection.
•  Telephone, fax, and modem protection if your system has a modem or is connected to a tele-
phone or fax. Many users forget that their telephone lines can act as a “back door” to fatal
surges, wiping out their modem and sometimes the entire computer.
•  Coaxial cable protection if your system is attached to a cable modem or cable TV. Just as tele-
phone lines can carry damaging surges, so can coaxial cable lines.
•  RJ-45/Ethernet cable protection if your system is attached to a network. Network cables can also
carry damaging surges.
•  EMI/RFI noise filtration (a form of line conditioning). This helps prevent electrically “noisy”
equipment such as printers from interfering with computers, but it’s best to plug laser printers
and copiers into a separate outlet (or separate circuit) from your computer if possible.
•  Site fault wiring indicator (no ground, reversed polarity warnings). This can prevent you from
using a bad electrical outlet, but it’s not a substitute for a true outlet tester.
 UL-1449 Third Edition Changes  
 In 2009, Underwriter’s Laboratory made significant revisions to its UL-1449 certification tests for 
surge suppressors. In addition to more rigorous tests, UL-1449 Third Edition now refers to these 
devices as Surge Protection Devices (SPDs) instead of the older term Transient Voltage Surge 
Suppression (TVSS). Surge suppressors manufactured before 2009 are designed to meet the 
older, less rigorous UL-1449 Second Edition standards.  
 The improvements in protection, as well as the fact that surge protection devices wear out over 
time, are good reasons to replace older units with those that meet UL-1449 Third Edition stan-
dards. 
 Contact the manufacturer before you buy to make sure you’re getting a model that has passed 
the revised tests.

CHAPTER
•  Most low-cost (under $50) surge suppressors are based on MOV (metal-oxide varistor) technol-
ogy; MOVs wear out over time and self-destruct when exposed to a very high surge. A surge
suppressor that uses MOVs should be replaced every two years. MOVs also present a potential
fire hazard because they have been known to catch fire when exposed to a high-voltage surge.
Better-quality surge suppressors supplement MOVs with other components, but the best (and
most expensive) models use non-MOV series designs.
•  Metal cases are recommended because the metal case helps minimize the risk of fire if the unit
fails, and it also helps minimize the odds of electrical interference with other devices.
•  If you use devices powered by AC/DC converter “bricks,” be sure to use surge suppressors with
extra-wide spacing between the plugs to provide adequate clearance.
 If you use surge suppressors with these features and attach your 
system to a properly wired outlet, you will minimize system prob-
lems caused by power issues.  
 Choosing a Battery Backup Device  
 Although high-quality surge suppressors stop damaging over-
voltages, undervoltages and electrical blackouts can also damage 
your system, and they pose even greater risks to your data. If you 
live or work in an area that is subject to frequent brownouts (voltage under 100V AC compared to 
normal 115V AC) or blackouts (complete power failure), or if you just don’t like surprise power fail-
ures, you need to add a battery backup system (also called a  uninterruptible power supply  or  UPS ) 
to your power protection lineup.  
 Most so-called UPS systems actually provide battery power only when AC power fails and should be 
called  standby power supplies (SPS) . However, the term UPS is used for both SPS-type and so-called 
“true UPS” systems, which power the computer from a battery at all times.  
 Most UPS systems contain integrated surge suppression technology but vary greatly in how long 
they’ll run your computer. Because a UPS is designed to run your computer only long enough to

shut it down without data loss, a runtime of 10–15 minutes is long enough to provide adequate 
protection. 
 The essential features of a battery backup system include the following:  
•  High-quality integrated surge suppression— In most cases, you should not use a separate surge
suppressor with a battery backup unit.
•  Appropriate sizing for your system and runtime— The price of a battery backup system goes
up significantly as the volt-amp (VA) rating climbs. Buying more than 10 minutes of runtime is
usually not necessary unless you frequently run programs you can’t shut down until the current
process is complete.
•  Automatic system shutdown after a power failure has been detected— This requires that your
UPS supports the version of Windows you’re using and that you connect the battery backup sys-
tem to your computer with a compatible USB cable. Although Windows 7 and 8.x have limited
support for battery backup units, you will get more information about your battery backup device
and have better control of its features by using manufacturer-supplied utilities.
•  Fast battery recharge, particularly if your area suffers frequent blackouts— Look for systems
that recharge in less than 12 hours if you rarely have blackouts, and expect to pay more for
recharge times of 6 hours or less.
 Right-Sizing Your Battery Backup System the Easy Way  
 If you know the wattage or amp requirements of your computer, its peripherals, and your monitor, 
you can manually calculate the appropriate VA (volt-amp) rating to look for in a battery backup 
system:  
•  Multiply the total amps by voltage (115 in North America, 230 in Europe and Asia).
•  Multiply the total wattage by 1.4.
 However, because it can be difficult to calculate the actual power consumption of your computer and 
its peripherals, the most convenient (and often more accurate) way to determine the battery backup 
size you need is to use the vendors’ interactive selection tools, available on most UPS vendor web-
sites.

  Basic or Enhanced Protection? Your Choice, Your 
Money 
 All battery backup (UPS) systems will power your system for several minutes during a blackout. 
Most will also protect you against power surges, and many will also shut down your system. 
However, some are designed to protect you against additional power problems, including the 
following: 
•  Undervoltage (brownout)
•  EMI/RFI interference (line noise)
•  Other power quality distortions
 More expensive battery backup systems typically provide these types of power-conditioning fea-
tures as well as basic power-outage protection, but you should carefully review the vendors’ data-
sheets to see the differences in features between battery backup systems with similar VA ratings 
but wide differences in price.

 Troubleshooting a Windows Tablet or 
Computer That Can’t Start  
 If you turn on a Windows tablet, laptop, desktop, or all-in-one computer and it powers up, but it 
won’t start Windows, there are two possibilities to check:  
•  Problems with boot configuration in the system BIOS
•  Problems with Windows
 In this section, you’ll learn the clues for each type of problem and the tools and techniques you need 
to get your balky system running again.  
 BIOS Configuration Settings  
 All recent laptop and desktop computers use either hard disks or solid-state drives (SSDs) that con-
nect via SATA ports to the motherboard. SATA drives can be configured in the system BIOS in three 
ways: 
•  IDE
•  AHCI
•  RAID
 Here are a couple of examples. In  Figure   8.1 , the SATA hard disk drives in this system are set to use 
AHCI. In  Figure   8.2 , the SATA drives use the older IDE mode setting.  
AHCI mode supports full-speed SATA hard disk and SSD devices

CHAPTER
 So, what do these settings mean?  
•  IDE — This setting makes the SATA drive act like PATA (IDE) hard disk drives that were once
common in Windows-based systems. When this setting is used, the SATA drive can’t use
advanced features, such as native command queuing and hot-plugging, and SATA 3Gbps and
6Gbps drives run at only 1.5Gbps.
•  AHCI — This setting supports the SATA drives’ advanced
functions.
•  RAID — This setting is used on systems that use two or more
drives as a logical unit (RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 10, and so on).
 When Windows is installed on an SATA hard disk, the configura-
tion used in the BIOS or UEFI firmware is recorded in the Windows 
Registry. Windows checks the Registry at startup to determine 
how to access the drive. If the drive configuration has changed, 
Windows crashes.  
 Windows Configuration Issues  
 In addition to incorrect SATA drive configurations, other Windows configuration issues that can pre-
vent Windows from starting include problems with recently installed hardware or apps, corrupt or 
missing startup files, and corrupt or missing Windows system files.  
IDE mode limits the performance of SATA SSD and hard disk drives

tem is configured before 
you have problems, see

Computer or Tablet for Easier 
Troubleshooting,”  Chapter

 These errors can cause Windows to display a STOP (blue screen) error. However, Windows is typi-
cally configured to restart automatically before this error can be displayed. To configure Windows 
so that a STOP error stays onscreen so you can determine what it is and look for solutions, see 
“Configuring Windows to Keep STOP (Blue Screen) Errors Displayed,”  Chapter   1  , p.41.  
 BIOS Startup Error Messages and 
Solutions  
 When a system has problems starting, it might display error messages at startup. These mes-
sages might come from the system BIOS (ROM BIOS or UEFI firmware) or might be generated by 
Windows. Typical error messages displayed by the BIOS include the following:  
•  Invalid system disk
•  Boot failure
•  Hard disk error
•  NT boot loader missing
•  Missing operating system
 These and similar messages indicate that the BIOS or UEFI firmware chip on the motherboard can-
not locate startup files for your operating system. Possible reasons can include the following:  
•  A nonbootable drive containing media is listed first in the boot order (BIOS/UEFI).
•  The computer’s system drive is not properly identified (BIOS/UEFI).
•  Data or power cables from the internal hard disk to the motherboard are loose or have failed
(hardware).
•  The drive has failed (hardware).
 These are listed in order of likelihood. As always, start with the simplest possibility: You’ve left a 
USB thumb drive plugged into your computer.  
 Disconnecting USB Drives  
 If your system is configured to use USB drives as the first bootable device and you leave a non-
bootable USB flash drive plugged into your system (either directly or into a USB hub connected to 
your system), your system won’t boot. Solution? Unplug the drive and restart your system.  
 If your system restarts correctly, you have a couple of choices:  
•  Don’t leave USB flash drives plugged into your system when you shut down the computer.
•  Change your BIOS or UEFI firmware settings to skip USB drives as bootable devices.

CHAPTER
 Checking and Changing Drive Boot Order  
 Should you change the boot order? It depends. More and more diagnostic programs can be run from 
bootable USB flash drives, and you can also install new operating systems from bootable USB flash 
drives. However, you can also use your system’s DVD or BD (Blu-ray) drive for these tasks. So, it’s 
up to you.  
 We recommend changing the boot order on Windows 7 computers if  
•  You use USB flash drives to speed up your system using the Windows ReadyBoost feature.
•  You frequently use USB flash drives to shuttle information between computers.
•  You frequently use USB flash drives for other reasons.
 However, you should leave USB flash drives at the top of the boot order if  
•  You frequently run diagnostic programs from a bootable USB
flash drive.
•  You install operating systems from a bootable USB flash drive.
•  You seldom or never use USB flash drives for data transfer.
 Here’s how to change the boot order in Windows 7:  
1.  Click  Start .
2.  Click the right arrow next to the  Shut Down  button.
3.  Select  Restart .
4.  After your system restarts, press the key that starts the BIOS or UEFI firmware setup program
(see  Figure   8.3 ).
5.  Navigate to the dialog used to set the drive boot order (see  Figure   8.4 ).
6.  Change the boot order to place the optical drive first, followed by the hard disk.
7.  Save your changes and restart your computer.
 Windows 8.1 (unlike Windows 8) does not support the creation of a CD or DVD repair disc, although 
you can use your Windows 8.1 distribution media as a repair disc. With Windows 8.1, if your system 
supports booting from a USB drive, you should create a USB recovery drive instead.  
 To learn more, see http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive.  
 Tip 
 If you change the boot order 
to remove USB flash drives 
or put them after the system 
hard disk, you can always 
change the boot order in the 
future to place USB drives 
first if you need to run diag-
nostic programs or install a 
new operating system.

 STOP (Blue Screen) Errors at Startup  
 If you turn on your Windows computer and, instead of seeing the Windows login screen or desktop, 
you see a screen similar to the one shown in  Figure   8.5  , you have a STOP error, also known as a 
“Blue Screen” or BSOD (“blue screen of death) error. What happened?  
Research this STOP error (0x7B in this example)
to determine why Windows 7 crashed
Research this STOP error (HAL_INITIALIZATION_FAILED
in this example) to determine why Windows 8.x crashed

Fixing Windows Devices That Can’t Start
204
 Blue-screen errors can be caused by many problems. At startup, they’re typically caused by prob-
lems with hard disk device drivers. If a blue screen error appears after you have booted to the 
Windows desktop, it could be caused by corrupt apps, corrupt device drivers, or memory problems.  
 When you see a BSOD error, be sure to record the numbers listed after the STOP message, such 
as STOP: 0x0000001E, or 0x1E for short. If the name of the error is displayed, such as KMODE_
EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED, record it as well. You can then look up the error number and name on 
the Microsoft Support Site ( http://support.microsoft.com ) to find Microsoft’s suggested solutions.

CHAPTER
 Unfortunately, Windows is typically configured to restart the sys-
tem immediately when a STOP error is displayed, so you can’t read 
it. To configure Windows so that a STOP error stays onscreen so 
you can determine what it is and look for solutions, see “Preparing 
a Windows-Based Computer or Tablet for Easier Troubleshooting,” 
 Chapter   1 , p.37.  
  Fixing 0x7B Errors at Startup  
 If you are building a computer, have just upgraded to a new hard 
disk, or have just replaced the motherboard battery that maintains 
system settings, it’s possible that your computer has “forgotten” 
the correct hard disk configuration settings.  
 Almost all hard disks are configured using Auto as the hard disk type. Thus, if the setup information 
is lost, the default (normal) setting is Auto and the drive will be properly detected.  
 However, the setting for the SATA interface used by your hard disk can be a problem. There are 
several possible settings for the SATA interface (IDE, AHCI, and RAID), and if your system is con-
figured using one setting, but a different setting is used in the system BIOS or UEFI firmware, your 
computer won’t start, displaying a 0x7B STOP error (refer to  Figure   8.5 ). 
 If you know the correct setting, follow these steps:  
1.  Shut down the computer and restart it.
2.  Start the BIOS or UEFI firmware setup program.
3.  Change the SATA setting to the correct value.
4.  Save settings and restart the computer.
5.  Select Start Windows Normally if prompted.
  Switching to AHCI Mode in 
Windows 7 and Windows 8.x  
 If your SATA drives are currently set to run in IDE mode, but you 
are planning to install an SSD, keep in mind that an SSD cannot 
provide you with faster performance unless you use AHCI mode. If 
the system crashes when you change SATA modes, how can you 
safely change from IDE to AHCI mode?  
 Before you make the switch, you need to enable Windows to use AHCI drivers when necessary.  
 The easiest way for Windows Vista and Windows 7 is to use the Fix-It wizard available from  http://
support.microsoft.com/kb/922976 . This page also details manual Registry changes that make the 
same changes as the Fix-It Wizard.  
 After you run the Fix-It Wizard or make the needed changes manually, you can safely enable AHCI 
mode in the system BIOS or UEFI firmware setup dialog (refer to  Figure   8.8 ), and your system will 
install the appropriate drivers and run properly.  
 Tip 
 You can also disable reboot-
ing in case of a STOP error 
with the startup option to 
Disable Automatic Restart 
After Failure or Disable 
Automatic Restart on 
System Failure. See “Disable 
Automatic Restart on System 
Failure,” this chapter, p.222.  
 Tip 
 If you don’t know the cor-
rect setting to use in step 3, 
choose IDE (also known as 
ATA or Compatible) if the sys-
tem is set to AHCI, or AHCI if 
the system is set to IDE, ATA, 
or Compatible.  
 Note 
 AHCI mode is also recom-
mended for full performance 
with SATA 3Gbps and 6Gbps 
hard disk drives.  

Fixing Windows Devices That Can’t Start

 Loose Drive Data and Power Cables  
 The interior of a desktop PC is a cluttered place. Whether you had your system opened up for a 
memory upgrade, component replacement, or just to see what’s “under the hood,” you might have 
loosened or disconnected the power or data cables going to the hard disk or the data cable connect-
ing the hard disk to the motherboard. If your system (C:) drive has disconnected or loose cables, you 
will see No Operating System or other similar error messages.  
 Most SATA data cables do not lock into place, so it’s easy to have a loose cable on either a drive 
( see Figure   8.9 ) or the motherboard ( see Figures   8.10 and   8.11 ).

 Similarly, SATA power cables can come loose from drives ( see Figure   8.12 ). 
 To solve problems with loose or disconnected cables:  
1.  Shut down the computer.
2.  Disconnect the power supply from AC power.
3.  Open the system.
4.  Check the hard disk or SSD for loose or disconnected cable(s).
5.  Check the motherboard for loose or disconnected SATA data cables.
6.  Securely plug the cable(s) into place (see  Figures   8.13 ,   8.14 , and   8.15 ).
7.  Close the system.
8.  Reconnect the power supply to AC power.

 Drive Failure  
 If your hard disk is making a loud or rattling noise when it’s running, it has probably failed. If the 
hard disk was dropped or smacked hard, a failure is very likely.  
 However, a hard disk might have failed if it is absolutely silent even when you place your ear next 
to it or does not get warm after the system has been on for several minutes. 
 Before assuming a hard disk has failed, perform this isolation test to determine whether the problem 
is the hard disk, its power cable, or its data cable:  
1.  Shut down the computer.
2.  Disconnect the power supply from AC power.
3.  Open the system.
4.  Locate the power cable running between the hard disk and the power supply.
5.  Disconnect the power cable from the power supply.
6.  If the power cable used a splitter or converter to provide power to the drive, plug the drive
directly into the power supply (if possible). If that is not possible, replace the splitter or converter
and make sure it is securely plugged into the power supply lead and the drive.
7.  Reconnect the power supply to AC power.

12.  Install a known-working replacement cable.
13.  Plug it into the SATA port on the motherboard and drive.
14.  Repeat steps 7 and 8.
15.  If the drive is still not working, the drive has failed. Replace it.
 Windows 7 Error Recovery and Advanced 
Boot Options  
 If Windows 7 is unable to start normally, Windows will display the 
Windows Error Recovery dialog. On a system that does not have 
Startup Repair files installed, the Windows Error Recovery dialog 
looks like the one in  Figure   8.16 . You can use a Windows installa-
tion disc or a Windows repair disc to repair your computer.  
 On a system that has Startup Repair files installed, the Windows 
Error Recovery dialog provides the options shown in  Figure   8.17 
when your system can’t start.  
 On a system that didn’t shut down properly the last time it was 
used (for example, if you used the power button because the sys-
tem locked up), Windows Error Recovery offers Safe Mode options, Last Known Good Configuration 
(advanced), or Start Windows Normally.  
 Note 
 If you have backed up your information, you can replace your hard disk and restore your system from a 
backup. However, if you have no backup and the information is vital, you can use a data recovery company 
to recover your data. These companies have clean rooms that enable safe replacement of failed compo-
nents and advanced data-extraction techniques. Expect to pay hundreds of dollars for recovery – if the 
drive’s condition permits it.

 Using System Restore  
 During Startup Repair, you might be prompted to use System 
Restore. If your system has stopped working after a recent hard-
ware upgrade, driver update, or app (software) installation, use 
System Restore to restore your system configuration to what it 
was at a date before the change.  
 Periodically, Windows creates restore points, which save the 
state of Windows in case of future problems. When you run 
System Restore, choose a restore point that is just before the 
event that is causing problems for your system ( see Figure   8.22 ). 
 To see which programs or drivers will be affected, click the Scan 
for Affected Programs link. Programs and drivers that will be 
removed are listed on top, followed by programs and drivers that 
will be restored ( see Figure   8.23 ). 
 After you confirm the restore point to restore, Windows restores 
the settings as they were and restarts your computer.

 Using Last Known Good Configuration  
 This Windows 7 feature enables you to restart the computer if it won’t start, but it started correctly 
the previous time. The settings used are the ones stored with the last successful boot.  
 Using Safe Mode Options  
 If Windows starts, but has problems shutting down or has video 
problems, it might be because of a malfunctioning video card or 
other driver or a malfunctioning startup program or service. To 
determine whether a driver is the problem, select  Safe Mode . 
Safe Mode starts up the computer with a limited set of drivers 
and services. Selecting  Safe Mode with Networking  adds support 
for basic network and Internet services (use this option so you 
can research problems online and download replacement drivers). 
Choose  Safe Mode with Command Prompt  to boot Windows to 
the command prompt with limited drivers and services.  
 In Safe Mode, you can open Device Manager and disable or 
update device drivers (if you use Safe Mode with Networking, 
you can get updates from the Internet). You can also run 
MSConfig to selectively disable startup programs and services before you reboot, use Event Viewer 
to see problems with your computer, and use the Registry Editor to make manual changes to how 
Windows runs.  
 Using MSConfig
Some Windows and most third-party programs and services will not run in Safe Mode. Thus, if your 
computer works properly in Safe Mode, you need to determine which program or service is causing 
the problem. To do this, start your computer in Safe Mode and run MSConfig to disable all startup 
programs and services:  
1.  Start MSConfig (use Search to locate it on your system).
2.  Click the Selective Startup button on the General tab.
3.  Clear the Load Startup Items check box (see  Figure   8.24 ).
4.  Click the Services tab.
5.  Click the empty Hide all Microsoft Services check box.
6.  Click Disable All (see  Figure   8.25 ).
7.  Click Apply.
8.  Click OK.
9.  Restart your system.

 If you are able to enable all non-Microsoft services and your system boots normally, restart 
MSConfig and select  Normal Startup  on the General tab. Click the  Startup  tab and disable startup 
items you’re not sure you need or that you don’t recognize. Restart your system. If it starts normally, 
one of the items you disabled is your problem.  
 Enable Low-Resolution Video  
 Use this startup option if you suspect that problems with your video card’s driver is causing system 
crashes, such as during 3D gaming. Your system will run normally, except for using a low screen 
resolution. You can adjust the resolution after the system starts, and you can adjust or replace your 
video card’s driver files before restarting.  
 Disable Automatic Restart on System Failure  
 Use this option to start your computer if a STOP (blue screen) error occurs during or after startup 
and the system reboots too quickly to see the full message. If a STOP error happens after you use 
this option, Windows will leave the error message onscreen until you restart your computer.  
 System Image Recovery  
 You can create a system image backup with the Backup and Restore utility in Windows 7. A system 
image is a backup of the system drive (typically C: drive) that includes Windows and system files.  
 If you have replaced a hard disk or have a badly corrupted system that can’t be fixed, you can 
restore a system image with this utility.  
 Windows 8 Error Recovery and Advanced

 Many of these options work the same way as in Windows 7, but two options in this list are unique 
to Windows 8/8.1: Refresh Your PC and Reset Your PC. They’re covered in the following sections. 
 Refresh Your PC  
 Windows 8 introduced Refresh Your PC as a way to solve major problems with your computer with-
out wiping out your information. Windows 8.1 also includes Refresh Your PC.  
 If you are unable to start your computer or have other major problems with it, choose  Refresh Your 
PC from the Troubleshoot menu shown in  Figure   8.27 . Refresh Your PC removes programs you 
installed but does not disturb your personal files. After you run it, your system reboots. At that 
point, you will need to reinstall apps and software you have downloaded from sources other than 
the Windows Store or installed from optical or USB media (apps you installed from the Windows 
Store or that were bundled with your computer are not affected). If you want to keep these apps, 
create a custom refresh image using recimg.exe and start the refresh process with  System Image 
Recovery (refer to  Figure   8.28 ). 
 Windows displays a list of removed apps on the Windows Desktop after your system restarts.  
Figure   8.30  shows an example of the Apps Removed report after running refresh on a system run-
ning Windows 8.  
 Note 
 To learn more about using recimg.exe to create a custom image backup with Windows 8/8.1, 
see  http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/01/04/refresh-and-reset-your-pc.aspx  and  
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2748351  
 Caution 
 If your system was originally set up with Windows 8 and you have updated it to Windows 8.1, keep in mind 
that using Refresh Your PC resets your computer to Windows 8. You will also need to reinstall Windows 8.1 
from the Windows Store.

CHAPTER
 Reset Your PC  
 If it’s time to give your PC to another user, or to sell it or recycle it, the one thing you don’t want 
left on it is any personal information. Use  Reset Your PC  to set your Windows 8.x system back to its 
original out-of-the-box condition.  
 Before you reset your PC, be sure to do the following:  
•  Disconnect all external drives connected to your computer.
•  Back up any of your personal files on internal drives.
 To use Reset Your PC, you will need a Windows 8.x installation 
disc or a USB Recovery drive.  
 During the process, you are prompted to delete your files from 
all drives or from the Windows drive only. Choose  All Drives  to 
remove your files from all internal drives.

 If you are planning to keep the computer and just need to reset it 
to its out-of-the-box configuration, choose  Just Remove My Files . 
However, to completely overwrite your files to prevent recovery 
(recommended if the device is being sold, given away, or recy-
cled), choose  Fully Clean the Drive  when prompted.  
 At the end of the process, you will be prompted to accept the 
license terms and perform other first-time setup tasks. The “new” 
Windows installation will prompt for activation if necessary.

 Troubleshooting 
HomeGroup Settings  
 If you use Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 at home or in a small 
office, HomeGroup network technology is an easy way to 
share folders and printers. Because it’s password protected, 
HomeGroup protects your information. But because only a single 
password is needed and setup uses a simple check box method, 
HomeGroup is also easy to manage. However, like any other net-
work technology, HomeGroup might stop working. In this section, 
we’ll help you get your HomeGroup working again.  
 Creating a Homegroup—and What to Do if You Can’t  
 A HomeGroup is a secure network feature included in Windows 7, 8, and 8.1. Any computer on the 
network can create a homegroup, and then others can join it—with one big exception: computers 
connected to a domain-based network can’t be part of a homegroup. 
 Here’s how to get started in Windows 7 or from the desktop in Windows 8/8.1:  
1.  Open Control Panel.
2.  Click or tap Network and Internet.
3.  Click or tap Network and Sharing Center.
4.  If you see the Ready to Create link next to HomeGroup, click
the link to set up a homegroup (see  Figure   9.1 ).
5.  Click Create a Homegroup.
6.  Select the items to share. By default, the music, videos, and
pictures libraries are shared, as are the printers installed on
your system. To share documents, click the empty check box
next to Documents. If you don’t want to share a library, clear
the check box for that library ( see Figure   9.2 ). Click  Next to
continue.
7.  After shared items are selected, the homegroup password is displayed ( see Figure   9.3 ). Write
down or print the password, because it must be used by other Windows 7, Windows 8, or
Windows 8.1 computers or tablets that want to join the homegroup. Click  Finish .
 Note 
 Homegroups are not sup-
ported in older versions of 
Windows (Vista, XP, and so 
on). To learn how to share 
folders with these versions 
of Windows, see “Sharing 
Files Without Usernames or 
Passwords,” p.256, this 
chapter. 
 Note 
 If HomeGroup status is 
Joined, the computer is 
already part of a home-
group. If HomeGroup status 
is Available to Join, click the 
link to join an existing home-
group.

  Choosing Home as the Network Type in Windows 7  
 When you first connect to a new wireless or wired network, you select the network type. The most 
common reason for not being able to create (or join) a homegroup is if the network type is not set to 
Home.  Figure   9.7 illustrates that if your network type is set to Work or Public, you can’t create (or 
join) a homegroup.

CHAPTER
 To change the network type, click it. From the Set Network Location dialog, click Home as the net-
work type ( see Figure   9.8 ). After you make this change, the Network and Sharing Center displays 
Home as the network type and prompts you to create or join a homegroup.  
  Choosing a Private Network in Windows 8/8.1  
 Windows 8/8.1 have only two network types: public and private. When you first connect to a wire-
less network with Windows 8/8.1, you are prompted to click or tap Yes if you want to find PCs, 
devices, and content on this network (see  Figure   9.9 ). When you select this option, you are connect-
ing to a private network, and you can create a homegroup (if none exists on the network) or join 
one. 
Click to change network type so you can create or connect to a homegroup
 Figure 9.8 
 Click Home as the network type 
if you want to use homegroups 
with this computer.  
 Caution 
 If you click the Treat All Future Networks That I Connect to as Public, and Don’t Ask Me Again check box 
shown in  Figure   9.8 , you won’t be prompted to select a network type when you connect to a new network.  
 This is convenient when you frequently use nonsecure networks (such as those in restaurants, hotels, and 
other public places), but it will require you to manually select Home as the network type when you want to 
connect to a new network with a homegroup.  

Solving File Sharing Problems
236
 Click or tap No for a public network, such as those used in restaurants, hotels, and other public 
places. You cannot create or connect to a homegroup in Windows 8/8.1 if you select No.  
 How can you change the network type if you made the wrong choice at connection time? As you 
can see from  Figure   9.10  , you cannot change the network type from the Network and Sharing Center 
dialog directly.  
 To solve this problem, you need to enable your network to look for other computers and devices. 
Here’s one method:  
1.  Swipe from the right or move your mouse to either right corner to open the Charms menu.
2.  Click or tap  Settings .
3.  Click or tap Change PC Settings.
4.  Click or tap  Network . The Connections menu opens.
5.  Click or tap your current connection.

 Joining an Existing Homegroup  
 After you create a homegroup on your home network, other 
Windows 7/8/8.1 computers or tablets can join it. Here are the 
requirements to join a homegroup:  
•  The network type must be set as Home (Windows 7) or private
(Windows 8/8.1).
•  The homegroup password must be entered correctly.
•  The computer or tablet must be connected to the same physi-
cal network as the computer that created the homegroup.

CHAPTER
 Can’t Join an Existing Homegroup  
 If you attempt to join an existing homegroup, you might see an error message when you enter the 
homegroup password (see  Figure   9.15 ). Because homegroup passwords are case sensitive, the prob-
lem might be that you misspelled the password. However, if you spelled the password correctly, 
this message indicates that a problem exists with your system that is preventing it from joining the 
homegroup. 
 If you can’t join an existing homegroup, there are several possible reasons:  
•  The network type you selected is Public — See “Choosing a Private Network in Windows 8/8.1,”
p.235, this chapter, or “Choosing Home as the Network Type in Windows 7,” p.234, this chapter,
for the solution.
•  Your computer has Windows updates pending — To solve this problem, finish installing updates
and restart the system if prompted. After restarting your computer, attempt to join a homegroup
again.

•  Your computer might have a different date and time than the rest of the homegroup — Check
the date and time on the computer that created the homegroup, and change your computer’s
date and time to match that computer. Then try to join a homegroup again ( see Figure   9.16 ).

CHAPTER
•  Check network settings — If your network settings are incorrect, you can’t connect to a home-
group. The easiest way to check network settings and to troubleshoot other typical causes of
homegroup problems is to run the HomeGroup troubleshooter.
 Using the HomeGroup Troubleshooter  
 Use the HomeGroup troubleshooter if you are having problems setting up a homegroup, joining a 
homegroup, or using homegroup shared folders and printers.  
 You can start the HomeGroup troubleshooter from two locations in Control Panel in Windows 7, 8, 
and 8.1:  
•  Launch the troubleshooter from the HomeGroup dialog, which is part of Network and Internet
( see Figure   9.17 ).

244
•  From the Network and Sharing Center, click Troubleshoot Problems (refer to  Figure   9.10 ), then
click HomeGroup from the list of Network and Internet troubleshooters ( see Figure   9.18 ).
 To show you how the HomeGroup troubleshooter works, we made two changes to a computer on 
the homegroup:  
•  We changed the date so it didn’t match the rest of the homegroup, and then restarted the com-
puter.
•  We disconnected it from the wireless network.
 Follow this procedure to use the troubleshooter:  
1.  The first screen in the HomeGroup troubleshooter briefly explains how it works. Click  Next to
continue.
2.  Click  Troubleshoot Network Problems  when prompted. Don’t skip this option unless you are
sure your computer’s network connection is running properly.
3.  If the troubleshooter detects any network problems, it displays a diagnosis and, if possible, offers
to automatically fix the problem. In  Figure   9.19 , my computer was not connected automatically to
the preferred wireless network.

or on a computer that’s trying to join a homegroup. When prompted, select  I’m Trying to Join a
Homegroup  if you are using the troubleshooter to help you join an existing homegroup.
7.  When the troubleshooter finds problems, it might be able to fix them, or it tells you what to do.
In this example ( see Figure   9.21 ), the problem is that the computer has a different date and time
than other computers on the homegroup. To fix this problem, check the date and time on another
computer on the homegroup and then change the date and
time on this computer. After this, follow the procedures listed
earlier in this chapter to connect to the homegroup.

 Homegroup Manual Repairs  
 If you have problems with setting up, joining, or using a home-
group, we recommend using the HomeGroup troubleshooter first. 
However, if the HomeGroup troubleshooter doesn’t find any prob-
lems, or its recommended solutions or automatic fixes don’t work, 
your homegroup might have more serious problems that require 
several steps to repair.  
  Generic Icons  
 If you see generic icons when you open a homegroup icon on your computer, the homegroup fea-
tures on your computers are not working (see  Figure   9.25 ). You will not be able to open a home-
group share or its contents.

 Unfortunately, the HomeGroup troubleshooter does not seem to be able to fix this problem. In our 
experience, the best way to solve this problem is to follow this procedure on each computer in the 
homegroup: 
1.  Close Windows Explorer or File Explorer.
2.  Start Control Panel.
3.  Click or tap  Network and Internet .
4.  Click or tap  Choose Homegroup and Sharing Options  ( see Figure   9.26 ).
5.  From the Change Homegroup Settings menu (refer to  Figure   9.4 ), click or tap  Leave the
homegroup .
6.  Click  Leave the Homegroup  on the next dialog.
 After completing these steps on each computer, follow this procedure:  
1.  Connect a computer that has not previously connected to the homegroup (I used one running
Windows 8.1) to the same network that the homegroup used.

4.  If the computers on the homegroup now display normal icons as in  Figures   9.23 or   9.24 , you have
repaired the problem.
  Cleaning Out Old Homegroup Files  
 If you cannot create, join, or leave a homegroup, or if the generic icons repair procedure doesn’t 
work, the problem might be related to leftover homegroup files on your system. Here’s how to 
make these files visible and remove them (as suggested by  www.eightforums.com/

CHAPTER
  Enabling Read/Write Access to a Folder  
 HomeGroup shares files on a read-only basis. In other words, computer A shares a file, and com-
puter B can open (read) it, but can’t change or delete the file on computer A. The standard home-
group sharing settings work well if you only want to open files, but if you need to make changes to 
those files and keep those changes on the original computer, you need to change how HomeGroup 
shares those files. Here’s how:  
1.  Right-click or press and hold a library or folder in Windows Explorer or File Explorer.
2.  Select  Share With .
3.  Click or tap Homegroup (Read/Write).
 See  Figure   9.30 .

 Depending on the number of files and folders in the library or folder, it may take some time to 
change sharing settings. After the process is complete, all homegroup users can add, change, or 
delete files in the library or folder, just as if they were sitting in front of that computer.  
  Sharing or Turning Off Sharing for a Specific Folder  
 The normal setup for a homegroup encourages you to share your documents, videos, music, and 
pictures folders with other users. However, you can share just a few folders if that’s what works for 
you at home or in the office. You can also prevent sharing of specific folders.  
 Follow the same procedure as in the previous section, but in step 3, select the level of sharing. In 
 Figure   9.31 , homegroup is being used to share a folder on an external drive.   
  Sharing Files Without Usernames or Passwords  
 If you have a mixture of Windows XP and/or Windows Vista computers on your network along with 
Windows 7 and/or Windows 8/8.1 computers, you can’t use homegroup to share folders with every-
one. However, there are two ways that you can share folders:

•  You can turn off password-protected sharing.
•  You can set up user accounts on each computer that needs to share information with other users
and then select those users.
 Turning off password-protected sharing should be used only if you have an encrypted wireless net-
work or if your wired network can be physically secured against unauthorized users. Windows XP 
refers to this type of sharing as Simple File Sharing, and it is enabled on most Windows XP systems 
at home or in small offices.  
 To turn off password-protected sharing in Windows Vista, open the 
Network and Sharing Center and set Password protected sharing 
to Off.  
 To turn off password-protected sharing in Windows 7 or Windows 
8/8.1, follow these steps:  
1.  Open the Network and Sharing Center.
2.  Click or tap Change Advanced Sharing Settings.
3.  Select the Home/Work profile (Windows 7) or Private pro-
file (Windows 8/8.1)and click the option for  File and Printer
Sharing;  then click the option to turn off  Password Protected
Sharing  ( see Figure   9.32 ).
4.  Close the Network and Sharing Center.
 To complete this task, you need to make the folders you want to share shared with Everyone. See 
the following section for details.

 Note 
 To share folders without using HomeGroup, make sure the workgroup name for all computers is set to 
the same name. Windows Vista, 7, and 8/8.1 use the default name WORKGROUP, as does Windows XP 
Professional. However, Windows XP Home uses MSHOME. The workgroup name is changed through the 
System properties sheet for each computer.

  Sharing Files with Specific Users  
 If you want to limit access to a particular folder to a particular user or users, leave password-
protected sharing enabled. You also need to do the following:  
1.  Set up an account on the computer hosting the share for each
user you want to have access to that share.
2.  For convenience, use the same username and password that
each user has on his or her own computer.
3.  Follow the procedure in the previous section to specify shar-
ing, but specify the user you want to share with in step 4.
 When that user tries to connect to the network share, Windows 
will prompt that person for the username and password you 
specified. 
  Streaming Media  
 If you want other network users to be able to stream (play back) your videos, music, and pictures, 
you need to enable streaming in Network and Sharing Center’s Advanced Sharing menu.  
 All media types you specified will be shared unless you limit media by star rating or parental rat-
ings. You can also limit which network users have access to your streaming media ( see Figure   9.35 ). 
Streaming media is played back using Windows Media Center.  
 To limit streamed media by star or parental ratings:  
1.  Hover the mouse over the streaming device.
2.  Click or tap  Customize .
3.  Uncheck  Use default settings .
4.  Click or tap  Only in the Choose star ratings section.
5.  Choose a minimum star rating.
6.  Click or tap  Only in the Choose parental ratings section.
7.  Uncheck any media categories you don’t want to stream.
8.  Click  OK when finished.
 Caution 
 If you are sharing with spe-
cific users who are running 
Windows XP, you will need 
to change the encryption 
method from 128-bit to 40-bit 
or 56-bit in Network and 
Sharing Center’s Advanced 
sharing settings dialog.

File Sharing with Portable Devices

CHAPTER
 File Sharing with Portable Devices  
 Portable devices (those that run iOS or Android) can share files with your Windows PCs in a variety 
of ways. As discussed in  Chapter   18 , you can use programs such as Dropbox or Google Drive to 
copy files between devices. However, the problem with this approach is that mobile devices have 
limited storage capacity and little or no expandability. Cloud-based services provide large amounts 
of storage, but can’t be used in locations where Internet access is not available.  
 If you want access to files on mobile devices even when an Internet connection is not available, 
you can combine wireless drives made for file sharing and streaming with special client software 
that can run on mobile devices so they can stream media content and upload (or download) files 
between devices. This method also eliminates the need to install additional network software on 
your Windows PCs (such as Samba, used for networking with MacOS computers).  
 Wireless drives such as the SanDisk Connect Wireless Flash Drive and Seagate’s Wireless Plus hard 
disk are compatible with PCs, MacOS, iOS, and Android devices. Here are the general steps involved 
in using these drives:

5.  Use the client software to detect the drive and configure it.
6.  Stream files from the drive.
7.  Copy files to the drive.
8.  Delete files from your mobile device after copying them.

 Troubleshooting File Sharing with Portable Devices  
 If you have problems with your wireless drive, check the following:  
•  Can’t connect to drive —   Make sure the drive is turned on and has a full charge. Make sure the
drive is on the same network as your mobile devices. If the drive is plugged into a computer, the
wireless radio might shut off automatically; disconnect the drive from the computer.
•  Can’t view contents of drive — Make sure you select the wireless drive in your client software.
Because you can upload and download files between devices, your wireless drive client software
can view the contents of your mobile device and the wireless drive.
•  Can’t locate files you uploaded to drive — Depending on the drive’s software, the file from your
mobile device might be stored in one or more folders named after your mobile device. If you have
more than one folder named after your device on the drive, open all of them to locate your files.

Troubleshooting Device Sharing
266
 Setting Up a Printer or Multifunction 
Device on the Network  
 There are three ways to add a printer or multifunction (print/scan/copy or print/scan/copy/fax) 
device to your network:  
•  Connect it to a local computer and share it.
•  Connect it directly to a wired network.
•  Connect it directly to a wireless network.
 Using the first method is easy, especially if you use the Windows 7/8/8.1 workgroup sharing 
method: 
1.  Install the normal printer driver on the computer that will host the device.
2.  Connect the device when prompted.
3.  After the installation is complete, check your workgroup or network share settings to make sure
the device is being shared.
4.  The first time that another computer on the network wants to
use the device, it needs to have appropriate drivers installed.
(These might be provided over the network or from drivers
installed on the remote computer.)
 If sharing a printer or multifunction device is so easy when you 
use a homegroup, why use the other methods? There are two 
important reasons:  
•  If the computer hosting the device is shut down or fails,
nobody on the network can print.
•  Network printer sharing supports printing only. The other functions the device can perform won’t
work if you use homegroup or other network sharing.
 To enable all computers on a network to use all the functions available in a multifunction device or 
printer, the device needs to be connected directly to the network, and the computers that connect to 
it need to use network drivers for the device or printer.  
 Connecting to a Wired Network  
 To connect a multifunction device or printer directly to a wired 
network, plug a suitable Ethernet cable from the switch or router to 
the Ethernet (RJ-45) port on the printer and configure the printer to 
connect via the network.  
 Note 
 To learn more about set-
ting up and using a 
Windows homegroup, 
see “Troubleshooting 
HomeGroup Settings,” p.230, 
in  Chapter   9 , “Solving File 
Sharing Problems.”  
 Caution 
 Some multifunction devices 
and printers use different 
drivers for local printing, for 
a first-time install to a net-
work, and for additional com-
puters on a network. Be sure 
to install the correct driver.  

267
Setting Up a Printer or Multifunction Device on the Network
10
CHAPTER
 Depending on the printer and the driver, you might configure the 
device via its driver installation and setup program or through an 
LCD menu on the device.  
 To connect to a wired network, configure the following:  
•  Device name—  If you have more than one multifunction device
or printer, consider changing the device name to a name that
specifies its location, such as DEN or OFFICE.
•  Automatic or manual IP address (TCP/IP setting)— Usually, you
should choose the option to get an IP address from the router 
(Auto/DHCP server). If you choose Manual, you must enter an IP 
address in the same range as other devices on your network but one that does not duplicate any 
other device’s IP address.  
 After you complete these steps, print the settings or view them on your device or printer’s LCD dis-
play (see  Figure   10.1 ). 
 After the device or printer is configured, a network-compatible driver must be installed on each 
computer or mobile device that will use the device on the network. See “Installing a Network 
Multifunction Device or Printer Driver,” p.270, this chapter, for details.  
 Tip 
 If you’re not sure if the device 
or printer has been config-
ured for network connection, 
use the Confirm Network 
Settings or equivalent menu 
selection on your device to 
see its current settings.

Troubleshooting Device Sharing

 Connecting a Device to a Wireless Network  
 To connect a multifunction device or printer directly to a wireless network, you must configure the 
device or printer to use the wireless network and its security settings.  
 With some multifunction devices or printers, you might need to set up the same configuration 
options discussed in the previous section before setting up wireless options. See your device’s docu-
mentation for details.  
 To connect to a wireless network with your multifunction device or printer, you typically need to do 
the following:  
•  Enable wireless networking on the device
•  Select an SSID (wireless network) to use
•  Select a connection type
•  Select an encryption type
•  Enter the encryption key
 There are several ways to configure these options. The easiest option is to use Wi-Fi protected 
setup (WPS). With WPS, you push a button on your router to set up your wireless network. With 
SecureEasySetup (SES), you must have SES-compatible wireless hardware (typically used in corpo-
rate networks). With WCN (Windows Connect Now), you plug a USB drive with the WCN informa-
tion from another computer on the network into your device. With Manual, you select the SSID, 
encryption, and other options needed. Note that not all network multifunction devices or printers 
offer all these options.  
 If you use a wireless router on your network (required for Internet access), choose Infrastructure 
mode if prompted.  
 The strongest encryption mode is WPA2, also known as WPA-PSK (AES). However, you need to use 
the same encryption mode and encryption key on all devices on your network.  
 If you don’t know what the correct encryption mode and key are, you can get this information from a 
Windows 7/8/8.1 computer connected to the network:  
1.  Open Control Panel.
2.  Open Network and Internet.
3.  Open Network and Sharing Center.
4.  Open Change Adapter Settings.
5.  Open the wireless network adapter you’re using to see the SSID (see  Figure   10.2 ).
6.  Click  Wireless Properties  and click the  Security  tab. The security type and encryption type are
displayed.
7.  To see the network security (encryption) key, click the empty  Show Characters  check box (refer
to  Figure   10.2 ).

Troubleshooting Device Sharing
270
 After the device or printer is configured, a network-compatible driver must be installed on each 
computer or mobile device that will use the device on the network.  
 See “Installing a Network Multifunction Device or Printer Driver,” p.270, this chapter, for details.  
 Installing a Network Multifunction Device 
or Printer Driver  
 After you set up network support on a multifunction device or printer, you must install drivers 
designed to access the device or printer over the network. Depending on the device or printer, the 
same driver might work for both local and network installation, or you might use different drivers.  
 During the installation process, the device or printer is detected and the appropriate programs are 
installed on the computer performing the installation ( see Figure   10.4 ). Repeat the installation pro-
cess on each computer that will connect with the device or printer.  
 At the end of the process, be sure to test your installation. Print a test page and scan a document or 
photo to see if network access to your printer or multifunction device is working.

 If you are unable to scan, print, or perform other tasks with your networked device or printer, check 
the following:  
•  Open Devices and Printers from the Control Panel and make sure the device or printer is listed as
available ( see Figure   10.5 ).
•  Right-click the device or printer and select  Troubleshoot  to detect problems.
•  If you are unable to see any network devices or access the Internet, run a network troubleshooter
to find the problem.
•  If the network is working and the printer you want to use is offline (ghosted out), make sure the
device or printer is turned on and is not displaying an error.
•  Make sure the device or printer is turned on. If it is not displaying an error, check the network
configuration. Reconfigure the device or printer and try printing again.

 Installing a Network-Attached Drive  
 The process of installing a network-attached drive includes the following:  
•  Connecting the drive to your network
•  Installing drive access software on all computers and devices that will use the drive
 Network-attached drives typically connect to the network via Ethernet: plug an Ethernet cable into 
the drive and a router. The router provides wired or wireless access to the drive after the drive 
is configured by the setup software provided by the drive vendor.  Figure   10.6 shows the Seagate 
Dashboard app used to manage a Seagate GoFlex Home network-attached drive.  
 Note 
 You can launch network troubleshooters from the Network and Sharing Center. To learn more, see “Using 
the HomeGroup Troubleshooter,” p.243, in  Chapter   9 , “Solving File Sharing Problems.”

 Troubleshooting a Network-Attached 
Drive 
 Problems with a network-attached drive can be caused by the following: 
•  Network connection issues
•  Router issues
•  Software issues
•  Drive issues
 If no other network resources or Internet connections are available, troubleshoot your network con-
nection. Troubleshooters are available from the Network and Sharing Center. These troubleshooters 
test your network adapter, connectivity with the network and the Internet, and provide solutions for 
you.

CHAPTER
 To solve router issues, shut off your router for about a minute and turn it on again. Wait a couple 
of minutes, and you should be able to connect to your network-attached drive and other network 
resources. 
 If other network resources are working, but your drive is not visible, check the drive for problems. 
Disconnect and reconnect the power and network cables, and look for problems indicated by signal 
lights on the unit. If the unit appears to be working correctly, reinstall the software.  
 If the drive is visible from some computers or mobile devices, but not others, make sure those com-
puters and devices are using the latest version of the drive’s software and that those computers and 
devices are authorized to use the drive.

 Troubleshooting Printer Driver Issues  
 Everyone keeps talking about a “paperless” office, but printers, 
especially multifunction or all-in-one units that also scan, copy, 
and fax, continue to be big sellers to home, small-office/home-
office (SOHO), and corporate users. In this chapter, we’ll help you 
get your printer to give you the print quality you deserve and 
help your mobile devices use your printer, too.  
 So, what’s the first problem to tackle? Making sure your printer/
all-in-one unit works with your version of Windows.  
 32-Bit Versus 64-Bit Windows and Printer Drivers
 Most laptop and desktop computers that run Windows use a 64-bit version of Windows, and most 
tablets and almost all netbooks use a 32-bit version of Windows. They look alike, but they don’t act 
alike. What’s the big difference? 64-bit processors are designed to work with much larger amounts 
of RAM than once-common 32-bit processors (which are limited to 4GB of RAM and frequently have 
2GB or less). 64-bit versions of Windows fully support 64-bit processors. Most of the current systems 
that use 32-bit processors (and therefore use 32-bit versions of Windows) are netbooks or tablets. 
These computers are designed  for long battery life, not high performance.  
 Although 32-bit apps work fine on 64-bit Windows, device drivers (the instructions that make hard-
ware and Windows talk to each other) must be designed for 32-bit or 64-bit devices. In other words, 
drivers for 32-bit versions of Windows won’t work with 64-bit Windows. 
 If you have a recent printer or all-in-one unit, this isn’t a big problem, because these devices are 
typically supported by both 64-bit and 32-bit drivers. However, if you have an older printer or device 
that still works, you could be a Windows upgrade away from not being able to use it anymore.  
 How do you find out which type of Windows you have? With Windows XP through Windows 7, fol-
low these instructions:  
 Note 
 In this chapter, I’ll use the 
term “printer” for both single-
function and multifunction 
devices. I’m not being lazy: it’s 
just that there’s no difference 
between the way each type of 
device prints.

 Get All the Printer Features You Paid For  
 It’s a myth that all the software included with a printer can be 
downloaded if you lose your disc. Although you can get replace-
ment (or updated) drivers for printing and scanning/faxing/copying, 
additional items such as page recognition software and photo-
editing software (for all-in-one units) and print head maintenance 
utilities might not be downloadable.  
 To get all the software you paid for, use the installation disc 
included with your printer. If the installation disc doesn’t include 
support for your version of Windows, download an updated driver 
and install it, then run the installation disc installer again and see if 
you can select only the bonus programs or utilities.

 Need a New Printer Driver? Here’s How to Get One  
 Even if your printer is currently working, a new printer driver might add additional features. This 
is especially true if you are using a driver included with Windows or with a Windows service pack. 
This type of driver is known as an  in-box or  in-OS driver.  
 Even if a new driver has the same features as your existing driver, it can be more reliable. To 
update a printer driver on your system, follow this basic procedure: 
1.  Visit the printer manufacturer’s website.
2.  Download the new printer driver; if you have a choice
between a basic driver and a full printer support package, look
over the contents of the full package and download it if you
want the additional features.
3.  Go to the folder (usually your Downloads folder) and double-
click the driver file to start the installation process. During the
process, it might uninstall your old driver.
4.  If the new driver asks to replace your old driver, select the
option to replace it.
5.  Follow the directions onscreen to complete the setup.
 Removing an Incorrect Printer Driver  
 Although most printer drivers check to see that you’re using the correct driver for your version of 
Windows, it’s up to you to select a driver that works with your printer. If you choose a driver that 
doesn’t work or a driver that doesn’t match your printer, take the following steps to remove it from 
your system in Windows 7 or 8/8.1:  
1.  Open the Devices and Printers folder in Control Panel.
2.  Right-click the printer you want to remove.
3.  Select  Remove Device  ( see Figure   11.4 ).
4.  Click  Yes to remove the device.
 Depending on the printer, you might also need to remove the printer driver and support files with 
Control Panel’s Uninstall a Program:  
1.  Open Uninstall a Program.
2.  Click the program to remove.
3.  Click  Uninstall .
4.  Click  Yes to confirm removal.
 Tip 
 If you’re not sure which 
driver you need, see if the 
vendor offers automatic 
driver detection on its web-
site. This feature can analyze 
your system to determine 
what printer you have and 
whether you need a new 
driver. You will need to give 
permission for the detection 
program to run.

 No Driver for Your Version of Windows? Workarounds 
and Fixes for You  
 It would be great if printer vendors would support your printer as long as it works. However, if 
you’ve been using a printer with Windows XP, now that Windows XP has finally been retired, 
you might discover that your printer might not have a driver for Windows 7 or 8/8.1. The obvious 
answer? Replace your printer with a new one. However, we’re in the business of giving you better 
(and cheaper) answers to your problems, such as these:  
•  No printer driver for 64-bit Windows 7— To solve this problem, we’re going to reach “back, back
in time” to find drivers for an almost-forgotten version of Windows: Windows XP 64-bit edition.
•  No printer driver for Windows 8/8.1—  To solve this problem, we’ll show you how to make
Windows 7 drivers work with Windows 8/8.1.
  Using Windows XP 64-bit Drivers with Windows 7  
 As you learned earlier in this chapter, you can’t use 32-bit drivers with a 64-bit version of Windows, 
or vice versa. This is a problem if your old printer isn’t supported on 64-bit Windows 7. In some 
cases, you can use a driver made for Windows XP 64-bit edition with a 64-bit edition of Windows 7. 
Here’s how to give this method a try:  
1.  Download the driver (don’t run it) from the vendor’s website.
2.  Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the folder where the driver was downloaded (usually
Downloads).
3.  Right-click the file and select  Properties .
4.  Click the  Compatibility  tab.
 Tip 
 If you are having problems with your printer and you don’t want to download an updated driver, try the 
Repair option shown in  Figure   11.5 . 
 Tip 
 Before you decide that your new edition of Windows doesn’t include a driver for your printer, plug the 
printer into a USB port on your computer and turn it on. If Windows has an “in-box” driver, it will recog-
nize your printer and set it up for you. You might need to download supplemental apps for your printer, 
but your printer will work.  
 If your printer isn’t recognized, turn it off and follow the tips in the next section.

2.  Install the utility.
3.  Right-click the installer file and select the option to extract the file to the current folder (see
 Figure   11.7 ).

  Using Windows 7 Drivers with Windows 8/8.1  
 You can often use Windows 7 printer drivers with Windows 8/8.1 by using a variation on the 
Compatibility tab method shown earlier in  Figure   11.6 . Instead of selecting Windows XP Service 
Pack 2 as the operating system to emulate, select Windows 7 and choose the  Run as Administrator 
option. 
 Troubleshooting Inkjet Printers  
 Inkjet printers are the most popular type of printer in homes, small office/home office, and office 
environments. They can print labels, photos, and documents with stunning color, crisp text, and at 
high speeds. Unfortunately, the fact that they use hundreds of tiny nozzles to produce documents 
and photos means that ink quality, paper quality settings, and nozzle clogging all threaten to dimin-
ish print quality. With printer ink being one of the most expensive liquids in the world, you want to 
get top-quality printing every time you click Print. This section helps you achieve that goal.  
 Testing Print Quality  
 The more often you use your printer, the less likely it is that your printer’s print nozzles will become 
clogged. Typically, I recommend that you save money and wear and tear on your printer by ordering 
prints of your favorite photos from a photo print kiosk at a local store or online. However, if you use 
your printer for photo prints, business cards, or other projects where print quality is paramount, it 
pays to check print quality before you use your printer. Here’s how.  
  Creating Test Prints  
 The quickest way to see if your inkjet printer is working correctly is to create a test print. You can 
create a test print from the Printer Properties menu:  
1.  In the Control Panel open Devices and Printers.
2.  Right-click the printer you want to test.
3.  Make sure plain paper is loaded.
4.  Select  Printer Properties  (see  Figure   11.8 ).
5.  Click  Print Test Page  (see  Figure   11.9 ).
6.  Click  Close on the confirming dialog.
7.  Click  OK to close the printer properties sheet.
 A good test print resembles the results in  Figure   11.10 . However, if you see streaks, blotches, or 
blank areas in either the text or the Windows graphic in the test page, you should consider cleaning 
the print heads before printing anything else.

CHAPTER
 Cleaning Print Heads  
 Print heads can become clogged for a variety of reasons (dried ink, paper debris, unplugging the 
printer rather than turning it off, and so on), but whatever the reason, clogged print heads will ruin 
your prints. To help prevent this, most inkjet printers provide some method for cleaning the print 
heads. 
 Cleaning the print heads uses ink, so you don’t want to perform it any more often than necessary. 
Some printer vendors provide a feature typically known as Nozzle Check to help you determine 
whether print head cleaning is needed.  
 To perform a nozzle check:  
1.  Load plain paper into the printer.
2.  Select  Nozzle Check  (see  Table   11.2 for details).
3.  After the Nozzle Check process is over, compare the actual printout with the sample provided
onscreen.  Figure   11.11  shows an example from an Epson XP-800 multifunction device.

 On Canon models, use the Cleaning button for the first cleaning. If the printer needs additional 
cleaning, use the Deep Cleaning button. With HP, Epson, and Lexmark (Dell) printers, you should 
not exceed three cleaning cycles at a time to avoid cartridge damage.

 Aligning Print Heads  
 Did you ever wonder how inkjet printers create large fonts and graphics with a tiny print head? The 
printer prints the document in horizontal strips, and the strips must align correctly. A misaligned 
black print head can produce an effect similar to  Figure   11.14  , whereas misaligned color print heads 
produce grainy output.  
 To solve this problem, use the print head alignment feature in your printer driver.  Figure   11.15 
shows the Epson XP-800 menu and one of the dialogs in the print head alignment process.

CHAPTER
 During the process, you will be asked to choose the best-aligned output from your printer for both 
black and colored inks. Most printers will remember this setting and use it from that point on. 
However, some printers require you to realign the print heads after you change ink cartridges, and 
others perform this task automatically for you. See your printer manual for details.   
 Selecting the Correct Paper Type and Print Quality 
Settings  
 If you mismatch photo quality and paper type settings, you’ll have problems getting good prints, 
whether you use the built-in Windows Photo Printer ( Figure   11.16 ) or an app’s own photo printing 
features. 
 Figure   11.17   compares the results when printing a photo on premium glossy paper with the Best 
Photo setting using the built-in Windows Photo Printer app, printing the same photo on premium 
glossy paper using the plain paper setting from a third-party app, and printing the same photo on

CHAPTER
 Third-Party Versus OEM Inks  
 It has frequently been said that original equipment manufacturer (OEM) inkjet printer inks are the 
most expensive liquids in the world on an ounce-for-ounce basis. It’s not surprising that many users 
have turned to third-party inks. They’re certainly less expensive, but lower cost isn’t the only factor 
to consider.  
 Reviews over the past decade from many sources suggest that third-party inks typically produce 
less-durable prints and are more prone to cartridge malfunctions. For these reasons, I don’t recom-
mend third-party inks. There are other ways to save money without risking image loss or damage to 
your printer.  
 High-Capacity Inks and Ink Cartridge Recycling  
 To save money on OEM ink, I recommend the following methods:  
•  Buy high-capacity ink cartridges— Most printer manufacturers offer at least two capacities of
ink for their late-model printers (and some offer as many as three capacities). For example, the
Epson 97 ink cartridge for some WorkForce series printers provides the same page capacity as
two Epson 68 cartridges for $10 less (Office Depot, March 2014) and prints 50% more pages than
two Epson 69 cartridges for $3.50 less. Check your favorite stores and ink types for details.
•  Buy multipacks— For example, you can buy a two-pack of Epson 97 cartridges for about $8 less
than buying two single cartridges.
•  Don’t overbuy—  Inkjet printers eventually fail, and with today’s rapid turnover of models, the
odds are slim that ink cartridges for your current printer would fit a new model. Have one spare

•  Know the rules for ink cartridge recycling and save money— Be sure to join the store loyalty
program so you get credit for ink purchases and cartridge recycling and be sure to spend the
credits you get. Some stores give you credit for recycled cartridges only if you buy ink at the
same time you return cartridges, so coordinate your recycling of ink cartridges and ink purchas-
ing (recycle and buy on the same trip), and don’t recycle more than the limit per month.
 Troubleshooting Printing from Memory 
Cards  
 Although it’s a lot cheaper to get prints of your digital photos from a store’s quick-print kiosk or 
online service, sometimes there’s no substitute for the immediate gratification of printing directly 
from a memory card using your own printer ( Figure   11.18 ). Keep these tips in mind for trouble-free 
printing.  
•  Insert the memory card all the way into the printer— As  Figure   11.19 reveals, a card inserted
only partway isn’t inserted at all as far as the printer is concerned. Push the card into place until
you see a blinking light, which indicates the printer is reading the card’s contents.

•  Printers want JPEG files—  RAW files need not apply. Although RAW files are better for exten-
sive editing, they must be converted into JPEG images before you can print. In other words, if
your memory card has nothing but RAW images on it, your printer will read your memory card’s
contents as “0 prints.” If you want to have RAW files for editing and JPEG files for quick prints,
set your digital camera for RAW+JPEG.
•  Choose the files you want to print— Use the preview feature to select the best photos from your
card. Your memory card can hold hundreds or even thousands of photos; you probably don’t
want prints of all of them (see  Figure   11.20 ).
•  Check your paper tray—    Make sure you have enough paper loaded for prints and that you have it
inserted the right way. If your printer has more than one paper tray (or cassette), be sure you’re
using the correct one for photo paper.
•  Crop it yourself the way you want it— It’s a long-time problem in both traditional and digital
photography that most print sizes don’t match the dimensions of negatives or image sensors.
Your printer will turn your photos into 4×6-inch prints, even though the proportions produced by
most digital cameras are different. Use the Crop feature in your printer to crop images to print
size. You’ll do a better job than the printer will (see  Figure   11.21 ).
•  Select paper size, print style, and print quality before you print— In addition to cropping, you
can select borders or borderless, whether to perform photo improvements, and other options (see
 Figure   11.22 ).

CHAPTER
 Troubleshooting Laser Printers  
 Many home and small-business users who don’t need color have found that laser printers and all-
in-one units provide faster printing and save big money over color inkjet printers (color inkjets are 
cheaper in use than color laser printers, however). Laser printers work differently and have different 
print quality problems than inkjet printers do.  
 Unlike inkjet printers, in which most moving parts are readily visible to the naked eye, a laser or 
LED printer’s mechanism is concealed within the printer cover. In fact, much of the imaging process 
is performed within the printer’s toner cartridge.  Figure   11.23 diagrams a typical laser printer’s 
internal components. The numbers refer to the steps performed in printing a page: 1 (processing), 2 
(charging), 3 (exposing), 4 (developing), 5 (transferring), 6 (fusing), and 7 (cleaning).  
 An LED printer is identical to a laser printer, except that a fixed array of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) 
is used in place of a moving laser beam to place the image on the rotating drum inside the toner 
cartridge. Because most models of monochrome laser printers use a toner cartridge that contains 
the imaging drum, replacing the toner cartridge is a fast way to fix many types of printing problems 
with laser or LED printers.  
 Color laser printers are becoming increasingly common as prices drop. Most recent models use four 
separate toner cartridges to enable faster single-pass printing ( Figure   11.24 ). As with monochrome 
laser printers, many image-quality problems with color laser printers can be solved by replacing the 
toner cartridge(s).

 Laser/LED Printer Status Lights and Messages  
 Laser and LED printers work differently than inkjet printers do. As soon as an inkjet printer receives 
data, it starts printing in a line-by-line fashion. Problems are visible right away because the printout 
starts immediately, right in front of your eyes.  
 By contrast, laser and LED printers are page printers; they must receive an entire page of text, 
graphics, and print commands and transfer them to the imaging mechanism, which transfers them 
to the paper before the paper emerges from the printer. Because of their more complex operation, 
more things can go wrong; correct interpretation of the printer’s signal lights or status messages is 
extremely important.  
 Because every printer brand is different, and most printers now use signal lights instead of an 
alphanumeric message display to indicate problems, our discussion of laser printer problems is a 
general guide. For the specific meaning of a given light pattern or message, see your printer’s man-
ual or check the printer vendor’s website for technical documents.  
 Generally, most laser/LED printers have a light on their control panel that glows steadily to indicate 
the printer is online (ready to receive a print job). This same light blinks when the printer is receiv-
ing a print job.  
 Most printers have two or more other lights that will shine or blink in various patterns to indicate 
problems such as the following:  
1. Paper path
2. Cleaning unit
3. Waste toner
4. Toner particles
5. Black toner
6. OPC belt
7. Yellow toner

•  Out of memory (The contents of the page are larger than the printer’s available memory.)
•  Paper jam
•  Paper out
•  Toner cartridge problems
•  Imaging drum problems
 Although a few printers might use an alphanumeric display panel to provide the error message, you 
will normally need to look up the light pattern for your printer to determine the problem and its solu-
tion. 
 The bottom line is, learn the difference between normal and abnormal light displays on your printer. 
 Common Laser/LED Problems and Solutions  
 Typical problems with laser and LED printers include the following:  
•  Poor print quality
•  Incomplete page printouts of graphics-heavy pages
•  Slow printing of graphics-heavy pages
•  Pages printed in reverse order when using the manual feed tray
•  Trying to print an image that’s too low quality for satisfactory reproduction
•  Running out of paper
 Use the following sections to solve the most common problems you are likely to encounter with your 
laser printer.  
  Troubleshooting Marks and Smudges on the 
Printout  
 Because of the different sizes used by the rollers, which are part of a laser or LED printer’s paper 
path, you can often determine the exact cause of repeating or continuous extraneous markings on 
your printer’s output by examining the distance between repeated markings on the output.  
 For example, with the HP LaserJet M1530 series all-in-one unit, repetitive print defects every 27mm, 
29mm, or 75mm typically indicate a damaged printer cartridge. Other marks indicate dirt or dam-
age to other parts of the unit. See the instruction manual for your printer to learn which marks are 
caused by problems with which part of the unit and how to clean it.  
 If the damaged or dirty rollers are within the toner cartridge, you might need to replace the toner 
cartridge. A continuous vertical black streak along all pages of the printout usually indicates a dam-
aged toner cartridge that must be replaced. Be sure to turn off and unplug the printer before chang-
ing toner cartridges or cleaning the printer.

  Can’t Print a Full Page  
 Even the lowest-cost laser printers should be able to print a page of text or a page with small graph-
ics. However, if you try to print a page composed mostly of graphics, a page that has several fonts, 
or a page with visible gridlines (such as a spreadsheet), you may run out of laser printer memory, 
causing an out-of-memory error. Because the printer could not finish printing the page, the page will 
remain in the printer until you eject it. When you eject it, only the part of the page that would fit in 
the printer’s memory will be printed.  
 Here’s how to cure problems with partial page printouts.  
•  Error recovery— To recover from this error, eject the current page (see your printer’s manual);
note that the page will not be completely printed but will appear to be cut off at the point where
the page contents exceeded the laser printer’s memory.
•  Workaround— If the page uses only one or two fonts but has a lot of graphics, the easiest way
to print the page is to decrease the graphics resolution of the printer in the printer’s properties
sheet. For example, reducing a 1,200 dpi (dots per inch) laser printer’s graphics resolution to
600 dpi reduces the amount of required printer memory by a factor of 4 (see  Figure   11.25 ).
Although graphics won’t be as finely detailed, text quality is unaffected. If the printer uses
PostScript, reduce the number of fonts in the document.
•  Solution— Install more memory in the laser printer. The amount of RAM required to print a page
varies with the printer’s resolution, the size of the graphics, the number of fonts on the page, the
size of the page (letter or legal size paper), and the printer’s ability to compress graphic data. For
a 600 dpi laser printer, your memory upgrade should add at least twice the amount of memory

CHAPTER
originally installed in the printer. For example, if your printer has 2MB of onboard memory and 
prints at 600 dpi, you should add at least 4MB (for a total of 6MB  of RAM). If you are upgrading 
a 1,200 dpi laser printer, add at least four times the amount of memory originally found in the 
printer. This will enable you to print complex pages at their highest resolution and print two or 
more pages on a single sheet of paper. It may also speed up printing because the printer doesn’t 
need to spend as much time compressing data.  
 See your printer’s instruction manual for the type of memory module or card needed to upgrade the 
printer’s memory. You can get some types of laser printer memory from memory specialist vendors 
such as  www.Crucial.com . 
  Paper Jam  
 Paper jams can be caused by incorrect paper loading, wrinkled or damaged paper, or damp paper. 
Here’s how to deal with a paper jam, and how to prevent it.  
•  Error recovery—  Shut down and unplug the printer and open it to locate the paper jam. You
might need to remove the toner cartridge on some models to find the paper jam. Remove the mis-
fed sheet(s) and be sure to remove any torn paper or loose labels. Resend the print job after you
turn on the printer. If the paper jam is located near the end of the paper path, beware of the hot
fusing assembly when you remove the paper jam.
•  Solution—    Be sure to load the paper tray properly and insert it completely into the printer. Use
only laser-compatible labels; copier labels aren’t designed to handle the heat of laser printing
and can come off inside the printer, possibly causing damage. If you can switch to a straight-
through paper path (usually an optional rear paper tray) for labels and similar heavy stock, do so
to minimize the chances of a paper jam (see  Figure   11.26 ). Avoid using paper that is damaged,
stuck together, warped, or wrinkled. Don’t use media that is thicker or heavier than the printer is
rated to accept.

  Paper Out  
 Running out of paper is a normal part of printing, but you can minimize the interruption to your 
printing task by filling the paper tray before you start printing a long document. Here’s how to avoid 
paper-out interruptions.  
•  Error recovery and solution— Open the paper tray and properly install new paper. Some printers
will print as soon as you close the paper tray, whereas others require you to press the online/
paper feed button to continue printing after you insert paper.
•  Workaround— If the paper tray is defective or if it isn’t completely inserted into the printer, you
might continue to get a paper-out signal even after you fill the paper tray and reinsert it. In these
cases, use the manual paper tray option (if available), use a replacement paper tray, or service
the printer if the paper tray isn’t a removable item.
  Toner Cartridge Problems  
 A damaged toner cartridge will put extraneous marks or smudges on every page it prints, and an 
empty toner cartridge can’t print anything. Sooner or later, you will need to replace the toner car-
tridge for one reason or the other. Here’s how to make sure whether the toner cartridge is the culprit.  
•  Error recovery— Shut down the printer and remove the toner cartridge (refer to your manual for
specifics). Verify that the toner cartridge is properly inserted and contains toner. Watch for print
quality problems when the first print jobs emerge after you reinstall an existing toner cartridge
or install a new one.
•  Solution— If the new toner cartridge doesn’t improve print quality, recheck the printer for other
problems; you may need to have it serviced.
 If you use a color laser printer, you need to determine which toner cartridge has run out or is dam-
aged. The colors are the same as those used in four-color inkjet printers: cyan, magenta, yellow, and 
black. Replace the correct color.  
  Fading or Uneven Text  
 Laser and LED printers normally produce uniform text. Here’s what to do if your printer is producing 
faded text or text that has different densities in different parts of the page.  
•  Error recovery and workaround— You’re probably running out of toner. Remove the toner car-
tridge and shake it gently, side to side, to redistribute the remaining toner more evenly. Print
only necessary documents and check print quality until you can install a new toner cartridge. If
you use a color laser printer, check the printer’s signal lights to determine which color toner car-
tridge is low.
•  Solution and prevention— Install a new toner cartridge immediately. To maximize toner cartridge
print life, use the EconoMode (toner saving mode) if available when you print draft copies. Note
that some color laser printers use a separate imaging drum that can also run out and must be
replaced periodically.

CHAPTER
  Print Falls Off the Page  
 The fuser assembly is designed to “bake” the toner to the page. If the fuser stops working, the 
toner won’t stick to the page.  
•  Error recovery and workaround— Clean the fuser assembly and retry the print job. If the problem
persists, replace the fuser.
•  Solution and prevention—  Install a replacement fuser assembly. These are typically included as
part of a maintenance kit.
 Checking Firmware and Number of Pages Printed  
 If you print thousands of pages with your printer, you will probably wear out more than your toner 
cartridge (imaging drum). See your instruction manual to learn how to print a status page that 
displays the firmware used by the printer, the amount of RAM installed, and the number of pages 
printed. Some models of laser printers require installation of a maintenance kit after a specified 
number of pages.  
 Using Maintenance Kits  
 Many HP and other laser printers feature components that should 
be replaced at periodic intervals. These components often include 
fuser assemblies, air filters, transfer rollers, pickup rollers, other 
types of rollers, and separation pads. These components wear out 
over time and can usually be purchased as a maintenance kit as 
well as separately.  
 A printer that uses a maintenance kit will display a message or an 
error code with a meaning such as “Perform printer maintenance” 
or “Perform user maintenance” when the printer reaches the rec-
ommended page count for maintenance kit replacement. Depending 
on the printer model and whether it is used for color or mono-
chrome printing, the recommended page count could be as few as 
50,000 pages or as much as 300,000 pages or more.  
 Troubleshooting Scan/Copy/Fax Issues  
 If you use an all-in-one unit, you’ve reduced the amount of clutter on your desk, but you now have a 
device that can cause additional headaches. Here are solutions for the most common ones.  
 Documents Jamming in Paper Feeder  
 The paper feeder makes it easy to do double-sided copying, scanning, and faxing, but only if the 
pages you feed it are in perfect shape:

•  Remove staples and paper clips.
•  Don’t try to feed torn or folded pages.
•  Avoid feeding pages with sticky notes.
 For pages with these and similar problems, use the flatbed scanner.  
 What Scan/Copy Settings Should I Use? 
 If you’re scanning or copying a black-and-white document, use the Document setting. Adjust con-
trast or brightness as needed for the best quality results. Scan at 300 dpi.  
 To scan a black-and-white or color photo you want to reproduce at the same size or smaller, scan at 
300 dpi. Select 8-bit grayscale for black and white photos, and 24-bit color for color photos. 
 To scan a black-and-white or color photo you want to reproduce at a larger size (or if you plan to 
crop the image and use only a portion of it), scan at 600 dpi.  
 The automatic scan or copy features provide little or no control over the image and are recom-
mended for “perfect” pages or photos. To get more control over the final result, select a scan option 
with more settings.  
 Can’t Use Fax  
 Be sure to follow the instructions for setting up your fax. If your office uses VoIP (voice over IP) tele-
phones, check with the vendor or your support staff to learn whether you can use a fax and what 
type of a connection to use.  
 In many cases, you will need to enter 9 to get an outside line and pause while the system switches 
to an outside line. If you don’t program in the outside line code, you won’t be able to send faxes.  
 Lines, Streaks, or Specks  
 If you see lines, streaks, or specks in copied or scanned printouts, check the scanner glass or the 
underside of the scanner lid for dirt. To clean the top of the scanner glass, shut off the scanner, 
unplug it, and spray glass cleaner on a clean, lint-free cloth. Use the cloth to clean the glass or the 
underside of the scanner lid.  
 Troubleshooting iOS and Android Printer

 If you can put your printer or device on your home or office’s wireless network, you can print to it 
with your iOS or Android tablet or smartphone. Follow these basic steps:  
1.  Configure your device to connect to the wireless network. If your office doesn’t have a wireless
network, configure your device to permit ad-hoc connections (typically up to four devices only).
2.  Make sure your device is visible on the network. It must have its own IP address.

HDTV, projector, or monitor to communicate with your home theater system or computer.  
 Troubleshooting TV and Video Inputs  
 To make it easier to select the correct input settings on your HDTV, projector, or monitor, you need 
to know which types of devices you have connected and where they are connected.  
 Typical HDTVs and projectors have the following ports:  
•  Cable/antenna port— Connects to cable TV, cable TV boxes, or antennas
•  HDMI port—  Connects to Blu-ray players, DVD players, streaming media players, receivers, and
computers
•  VGA port— Connects to computers
•  Component video port— Connects to DVD players
•  S-video port— Connects to VCRs and older DVD players
•  Composite video port— Connects to VCRs, older DVD players, and streaming media players
•  S/PDIF digital audio port— Connects to receivers
•  USB port— Connects to USB flash memory drives and streaming media players
 LCD and LED monitors have HDMI, VGA, or DVI ports. These ports (except for USB and DVI ports), 
are shown in  Figure   12.1 . Refer to  Figure   1.4 ( Chapter   1 ) for DVI and USB ports.  
 Figure   12.2  illustrates typical video cables used by computers, HDTVs, and projectors.  
 To display a picture from any video source, you must follow these steps:  
1.  Connect the video source to the HDTV or projector or to an AV receiver that is connected to an
HDTV or projector.
2.  Turn on the projector or HDTV.
3.  Turn on the video source and AV receiver.
4.  Turn on the video source.
5.  If necessary, select the correct output from the video source.

•  Show Desktop Only on 2— Choose this option to use only the display identified as 2.
 Now that you know what you can do, let’s take a closer look at when to use each option.  
  When to Use the Duplicate Option  
 Use the Duplicate option when  
•  You are using both displays to share information—for example, you have an informational kiosk
connected to an HDTV, monitor, or projector facing a different part of the audience.
•  You need to see what the audience sees during a presentation.
 Here are some issues to consider:  
 If you select the Duplicate option, both your primary display and the additional display (HDTV, pro-
jector, or monitor) will be set to the same resolution. In  Figure   12.8 , we compare the resolutions of 
the laptop display and an additional display before and after duplicating the displays.  
 If your primary display and HDTV or projector don’t use the same recommended resolution (as in 
 Figure   12.8 ), this can cause problems.  
 If you are using this setup for a presentation, the resolution selected for the projector might not be 
the best possible setting. For example, if you are connecting to a projector that has 800x600 rec-
ommended resolution, you will need to select 1024x768 for both your display and projector if you 
want to be able to run Windows and Windows software adequately. The projector will use image 
compression to display higher-resolution signals, and you might need to increase text size using the 
Make Text and Other Items Larger or Smaller menu to compensate.  
 Tip 
 If you use the Screen Resolution dialog ( refer to Figure   12.7 ) with Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1, you can 
change the display identified as 1. To do so, select an additional display (2 or higher) and click the empty 
 Make This My Main Display  check box. That display becomes display 1, and the former display 1 becomes 
display 2.  
 To change the original display back to display 1, select it and click its  Make This My Main Display  check 
box.

  When to Use the Extend These Displays Option  
 Use the Extend These Displays option when you  
•  Need to see speaker notes or other content while displaying a presentation
•  Want to use the higher-resolution display at maximum resolution
•  Need to run different apps on each display
 If you use Extend These Displays with a slide show app and you want to run the slide show on the 
extended desktop, make sure the app can be set to run on an extended display, or use the option to 
switch display 1 and display 2, making your projector, HDTV, or monitor your primary display.

 Can’t Hear Computer Audio Through AV 
Receiver  
 Whether you have an old receiver designed before the advent of HDMI ports (which carry both 
audio and video data) or a current model that’s loaded with HDMI ports, hearing computer audio 
through your receiver depends on these factors:  
•  Correct cabling between your computer and your receiver.
•  Correct configuration of Windows sound settings to use your receiver.
 Figure   12.15  illustrates S/PDIF and analog audio jacks on a typical desktop computer.  
 Connecting Analog Audio Ports to a Receiver  
 If your computer or your receiver lacks support for HDMI or the older S/PDIF digital audio standards, 
you need to use analog audio cables between your PC and your receiver.  
 On a desktop PC, connect the stereo mini-jack port (usually color-coded lime green) mini-jack port on 
the sound card or integrated audio section of the port cluster to an appropriate set of stereo jacks on 
your receiver, such as the Aux jacks.  
 On a laptop or tablet, use the headphone jack if a separate stereo jack is not available.  
 A mini-jack to RCA stereo cable ( see Figure   12.16  ) is the easiest way to make this connection.

CHAPTER
 Connecting Digital Audio to a Receiver  
 Many computers also offer one or more ways to output digital audio 
to a receiver. These include  
•  HDMI (carries both audio and video signals)
•  S/PDIF coaxial
•  S/PDIF optical
  S/PDIF Coaxial  
 The S/PDIF coaxial cable (refer to  Figure   12.16 ) uses an RCA con-
nector similar to those used by stereo analog audio cables, but the cable is heavier. You push it into 
place. 
  S/PDIF Optical  
 The S/PDIF optical cable (refer to  Figure   12.16 ) is a fiber optic 
cable. The connectors on each end of the cable are protected with 
caps that must be removed before the cable can be used. The opti-
cal connector on an HDTV or receiver (refer to  Figure   12.1 ) has a 
hinged door to protect against dust. Push the cable until it snaps 
into place.

types of connectors.  
 Note 
 On a computer, the S/PDIF 
optical connector is usually 
covered with a removable 
cap. Remove the cap to make 
the connector shown in 
 Figure   12.1 visible.  

Troubleshooting Home Theater, HDTVs, and Projectors

  HDMI 
 An HDMI cable (refer to  Figure   12.2 ) can carry digital audio and 
digital video at the same time.  
 Although all versions of HDMI use the same connector, there have 
been several HDMI standards over time. HDMI cables are now 
identified by supported features, rather than by standards, because 
some features are optional. We recommend cables that meet the 
key features of the HDMI 1.4 standard, including the following:  
•  3D compatibility
•  Audio Return Channel
•  HDMI Ethernet
•  Support for Dolby TrueHD and Advanced DTS-HD Master Audio
 Selecting the Correct Audio Output Type on Your PC  
 Some computers automatically detect the correct audio output to use when you connect to a receiver 
via HDMI. However, other types of audio output must be selected manually. From the Control Panel 
in Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1, follow this procedure:  
1.  Click or tap Hardware and Sound.
2.  In the Sound category, click or tap Manage Audio Devices.
3.  Click or tap a playback device on the Playback tab ( see Figure   12.17 ).
4.  To make the selected device your default, click or tap Set Default.
5.  Click  Apply , then  OK to use your new selection.
 Note 
 You might need to use S/PDIF 
or stereo cables to transmit 
audio from some Blu-ray 
players to a receiver. To learn 
more about HDMI standards, 
see the HDMI website at 
 www.hdmi.org .

 Selecting the Correct Speaker Configuration on 
Your PC  
 Depending on the audio type you select, you might need to select the correct speaker configuration. 
S/PDIF devices support stereo speakers. However, other types of audio might support up to seven 
speakers plus a subwoofer.  
 To select the correct speaker configuration, click the  Configure button shown in  Figure   12.17  when 
it’s available. Select the number of speakers your audio output is connected to ( see Figure   12.18  ). Use 
the  Test button to play a sequence of notes through each speaker. To test a specific speaker, click it.  
 If you use full-range speakers (speakers without a subwoofer), select that option from the next 
dialog.

 Selecting the Correct Input Type on Your Receiver  
 The previous section’s instructions apply whether you are connecting directly to speakers or 
through a receiver. However, if you are connecting to a receiver, you must also select the correct 
input type on your receiver.  
 As  Figure   12.19  indicates, a typical receiver has several inputs ready for different types of audio 
and video connections. Most of them are on the rear, but many receivers also feature front-mounted 
inputs. 
 Some connections are very simple. For example, if your PC has an HDMI port, connect it to HDMI 
port #5, labeled (PC) in  Figure   12.19 . However, if you want to connect the S/PDIF port on your PC 
or other device to the receiver, connect it to either the Optical or one of the Coaxial ports on the left 
side of  Figure   12.19 . 
 If you use an assignable connection (a connection that can be used by various devices), you must 
use the receiver’s setup program to specify which device uses that connection.

CHAPTER
 After you connect your device to the appropriate input and assign that input (if necessary), you must 
select the correct input on the receiver. You can use either the front-panel controls or the receiver’s 
remote control. If you select the wrong input, you will not hear your computer or other device.  
 I Want to Play Music on My iOS Device 
Through My Receiver  
 Your receiver is a great way to enjoy your music. Depending on your receiver, there are many ways 
to make a connection: audio cable, docking device, Bluetooth, Apple Airplay, or Wi-Fi.  
 Using an Audio or USB Cable  
 The headphone or earbud jack or the USB charging port on your iPhone, iPod, or iPad are the easiest 
ways to connect to higher-quality sound. Just plug in your device, select the appropriate output on 
your receiver, and select the music you want to play.  
 Using a Docking Device  
 Docking devices for iOS devices are available in many varieties, including those that enable your iOS 
device to connect to a receiver. If you have an iOS device with a 30-pin connector for the USB charg-
ing cable, you have more choices than those with the newer Lightning connector.  
 Note 
 For ports labeled as “Assignable,” such as S/PDIF ports, you must use the receiver’s setup menus to select the 
input that will be used for the port. See your receiver’s instruction manual for details.  
 Tip 
 If you can’t hear anything coming from your home theater system after you connect your device and start 
playing a song, check the volume controls on both your receiver/sound bar and your device.  
 Caution 
 On some receivers, the USB connection does not work with your tablet or smartphone: it is reserved for USB 
storage devices. Be sure to check the receiver’s specifications to determine what types of devices the USB 
port supports.  
 Some receivers don’t have a mini-jack port for your tablet or smartphone. If RCA input connections are 
available, you can use a stereo RCA to mini-jack adapter.  

Troubleshooting Home Theater, HDTVs, and Projectors
328
 As an alternative, most late-model AV receivers now support Bluetooth or Wi-Fi wireless connec-
tions. If you have a mixture of 30-pin and Lightning connection iOS devices, using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi 
avoids connection issues.  
 Using Bluetooth on iOS  
 If your receiver has Bluetooth capability, use your device’s Bluetooth feature to connect to it and 
play your audio:  
1.  Select your music track.
2.  Enable Bluetooth on your device.
3.  Select Bluetooth on your receiver.
4.  Pair the devices.
5.  Open your device’s Control Center (see  Figure   12.20 ).
6.  Select Bluetooth.
7.  Tap  Play  to enjoy your music.

 Apple AirPlay  
 Apple’s AirPlay technology, originally developed for Apple TV, is supported by many late-model AV 
receivers for music playback. AirPlay provides better audio quality than Bluetooth and enables play-
back of music from a greater distance than Bluetooth. Use the Control Center to select a device to 
stream to (see  Figure   12.21 ). 
 Using Wi-Fi  
 If your AV receiver supports Wi-Fi and offers a remote control app for your iOS device, you can use 
your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch to control your receiver. To connect to your receiver with Wi-Fi:  
1.  Connect your receiver to the same Wi-Fi network used by your device.
2.  Turn on your device’s Wi-Fi capability.
3.  Install the remote control app for your receiver (or a compatible third-party app) from the App
Store.
4.  Detect your receiver with the app.
5.  Use the app to stream music from your iOS device or other supported devices, control your
receiver, and play Internet radio.
 I Want to Play a Movie on My iOS Device 
Through a Home Theater System  
 IOS devices don’t have an HDMI port, so to stream movies or other video content from your device 
to an HDTV, you must connect to your receiver or HDTV via a device that has an HDMI port. Your 
options include Apple AV cable, Apple TV, third-party docking devices, or third-party software that 
supports Apple’s AirPlay technology. Let’s take a look at each of them in turn.  
 Apple AV Cable and Compatible Cable and Docking 
Products  
 The least expensive Apple-branded hardware device you can use to connect your iOS devices to a 
home theater system or HDTV is the appropriate version of the Apple AV cable:  
•  Apple composite AV Cable— Composite video and stereo audio cables that use RCA jacks (refer
to  Figures   12.2 and   12.16 ) for 30-pin iOS devices. This is suitable for use with AV receivers that

have an AUX port, SDTVs, or DVD players that have a compos-
ite input.  
•  Apple 30-pin digital AV adapter— HDMI A/V port (refer to
 Figure   12.2 ) and 30-pin charging port.
•  Apple 30-pin to VGA adapter— VGA port and 30-pin charging
port.
•  Lightning digital AV adapter— HDMI A/V port and Lightning
charging port.
•  Lightning to VGA adapter— VGA port and Lightning charging
port. This is suitable for use with older HDTVs that lack HDMI
ports or with computer displays.
 There are many third-party equivalents to the 30-pin digital 
AV adapter, and some vendors also offer docking products that 
enable your iOS device to stand upright while being connected 
and charged.  
 Apple TV  
 Apple TV offers a number of advantages over HDMI adapters. 
These include  
•  Hardware-based HDMI, rather than using DLNA converted to
HDMI, for better compatibility with protected content.
•  S/PDIF optical connector for digital music for use with home
theater systems or TVs that don’t support audio through
HDMI.
•  Wi-Fi or wired Ethernet connections to your home network.
•  Support for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wireless-N networking, so it’s also compatible with all other
wireless networks (A, B, G, AC).
•  AirPlay support for streaming video and audio from major streaming vendors such as Netflix,
Amazon Prime, Hulu, and others.
•  Streaming media from Windows PCs and MacOS devices.
 You can configure Apple TV with your iPad 3 or later or iPhone 4s or later using Bluetooth (see 
 http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5900  for details) or with the included remote. Using your iOS device 
via Bluetooth is easier than using the remote, because Apple TV can read your network configura-
tion from your device.  
 In either case, you will need to have your iTunes Store username and password and the usernames 
and passwords for any third-party streaming media services you want to set up.  
 Note

30-pin versions. Also, note
that playback of certain
types of content, especially

 I Want to Play a Movie on My Android 
Device Through a Home Theater System  
 Android devices offer three ways to play back video stored on the device:  
•  If you have a tablet with a mini-HDMI (also known as HDMI Type C) connector, you can use a
mini-HDMI to HDMI cable to play back content directly from your tablet to most HDTVs or AV
receivers.
•  If you have a smartphone that supports mobile high-definition
link (MHL), you can buy a cable that attaches your smartphone
to an AV receiver, HDTV, Blu-ray disc player, or other media
device that supports MHL.
•  If you have an Apple TV box or other device that supports
AirPlay, you can get apps from Google Play that can be used
to stream video from your device. For example, the free ver-
sion of the AppleTVMedia player from Zappotv.com plays
videos and photos stored on your device and YouTube videos.
Low-cost add-ons provide support for playing media located
on Windows streaming media servers on your home network.
 The Google Chromecast device, rather than playing back con-
tent stored on your Android device, allows you to view Netflix, 
YouTube, or other supported streaming video services on an 
HDTV or AV receiver.  
 I Can’t Sync Music with my iOS or Android 
Device 
 You can enjoy music from Internet radio stations with your iOS or Android device, but if you prefer 
to create your own playlist from your own digital music tracks, you will need to sync your device, 
using iTunes (iOS) or the sync software provided with your Android device.  
 Troubleshooting Syncing to an iOS Device  
 You can use iTunes to sync your existing music tracks to iTunes either via USB or wirelessly. iTunes 
might have problems syncing your existing music tracks to iTunes for several reasons:  
•  iTunes doesn’t know where your files are located.
•  Your music is in an unsupported format.
•  You need to enable the sidebar.
•  You need to enable Wi-Fi syncing.
 Note 
 MHL-compatible devices 
might use a proprietary cable, 
a micro-USB to HDMI cable, 
or an MHL cable. See your

 Caution 
 Wi-Fi synchronization doesn’t always work. To troubleshoot Wi-Fi syncing, see  http://support.apple.com/kb/
ts4062 . Additional solutions suggested by some users include the following:  
  •  Stop and restart services used by iTunes on a Windows PC: Bonjour and those listed in
http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3960 .
  •  Try a different wireless network (note: both your computer and your iOS device must always use the same
wireless network).
  •  Use a different wireless router or get a firmware update for your router.
 If you cannot get Wi-Fi synchronization to work reliably, we recommend using USB sync.

 Troubleshooting Syncing to an Android Device  
 Android, unlike iOS devices, lacks a single file sync program. Your device might include file sync 
software. For example, Samsung Android-powered tablets and smartphones typically include Kies 
sync software. However, you can get additional sync apps from Google Play.  
 Some problems you might encounter include incompatible file types, DRM music or audio book files, 
and connection problems. Here are some workarounds and solutions:  
  Incompatible File Types  
 You can only sync files recognized by your device. For example, if you want to sync RAW photo files 
on your device, you must first convert them to JPEG, and only the JPEG versions can be synced. 
See  http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html  for a list of supported media 
formats. Additional formats (such as RAW) can be read by specific apps, but are typically not sup-
ported for sync. Use Windows (File) Explorer, Dropbox, or other utilities to transfer file types that are 
not compatible with sync.  
  DRM Files  
 Windows Media Audio (WMA) files used for audio books or music purchases might be copy pro-
tected using digital rights management (DRM). Most Android players have problems with DRM files. 
To avoid problems, use MP3 files if possible, or try a different media player, such as VLC for Android 
or MortPlayer Audio Books (both available from Google Play).  
  Connection Problems  
 If you want to use a web-based wireless sync program, you might have problems with Java set-
tings. You might need to adjust the security settings for Java to enable a web-based transfer pro-
gram to work.  
 Selecting the Correct Settings for Ripping a CD  
 If you want to rip your CD collection for playback with a mobile device or desktop media players, 
you can use Windows Media Player. Before you rip your CDs, configure your rip settings:  
1.  Start Windows Media Player.
2.  Click or tap  Tools .
3.  Click or tap  Options .
4.  Click or tap the  Rip Music  tab.
5.  Select  MP3 as the format.
6.  Adjust the size/quality slider.
7.  If you want to rip each CD as soon as you insert it, click or tap the  Rip CD Automatically  check
box.
8.  Click  Apply , and then  OK ( see Figure   12.25 ).

 Tip 
 If you plan to play your music through an AV receiver, select better quality (160Kbps or higher). If you plan 
to play your music using a portable device’s own speakers or with earbuds, select smallest size (128Kbps). I 
typically rip at 320Kbps (best quality, largest file size). Some sync programs, such as iTunes, can reduce the 
size of music files during the sync process.  
 You can use iCloud, Google Play, or Wi-Fi–enabled storage devices to store your music in the cloud or off 
your device so you can use higher quality ripping without using up space on your device. For more about 
iCloud for iOS devices, see  www.apple.com/icloud/features/ . For more about Google Play, see  https://play.
google.com/about/music/allaccess/#/ . For more about wireless media storage, see “File Sharing with Portable 
Devices,” in  Chapter   9 , “Solving File Sharing Problems,” p.229.  

Troubleshooting Home Theater, HDTVs, and Projectors

 I Can’t Play Back Content Through AV 
Receiver  
 If you’ve hit Play on your digital media player, but you don’t hear or see anything, what’s wrong? 
Use this checklist to help you figure out the problem and solve it fast.  
 Incorrect Input Selected  
 If you connect your streaming media players, DVD or Blu-ray players, or other media devices directly 
to your HDTV, you need to select the correct input on your HDTV. However, if you connect your 
devices to an AV receiver, you select the correct input on your AV receiver.  
 Before you select the correct input, make sure the device is turned on (streaming set-box player 
boxes stay on all the time, but Blu-ray and DVD players are usually turned off when not in use).  
 Create a “cheat sheet” to help you remember which input goes with each device.  
 Incorrect Cabling Between Devices  
 If your device uses a single HDMI cable to the AV receiver or HDTV, it’s practically foolproof. 
However, if you are connecting multiple cables, there’s a lot that can go wrong.  
 Take advantage of color-coded RCA connectors for stereo audio (red and white) and component 
video (red, green, blue). Most cables and device connectors use these standard color codes to make 
connection easier.  
 If your HDTV needs to use an S/PDIF return audio cable to the receiver, make sure it’s plugged in 
correctly and that the receiver is properly configured to use it.  
 Loose Speaker Wires  
 If you lose one side of your stereo sound or the rear audio disap-
pears after you’ve been enjoying surround-sound realism, check 
the speaker and the receiver for loose wires.  
 Tip 
 Some remotes included with AV receivers can also be used to control HDTVs, and intelligent remotes such 
as Logitech’s Harmony series can be used to store the combinations of devices and inputs needed for each 
type of media you enjoy. To learn more about Logitech Harmony remotes, see  www.logitech.com/en-us/
harmony-remotes . To learn more about multifunction remote apps for your iOS or Android device, 
see  http://hometheaterreview.com/goodbye-universal-remote-hello-control-app/ and  
http://hometheater.about.com/od/gadgetsgizmos/tp/iphone-home-theater-remote-control-apps.htm . 
 Tip 
 Be sure to leave some slack 
when you install or reinstall 
speaker wires so the receiver 
and speakers can be moved 
without putting stress on the 
wires.

I Can’t Play Back My Blu-ray Movies
12
CHAPTER
 Receiver or Device Muted  
 Both a receiver and mobile device can be muted, so if you don’t hear any audio, make sure your 
devices are not muted. If none of the devices are muted, be sure to turn up the volume on both 
devices until you hear a comfortable audio level.  
 Content Not Supported  
 If you are unable to play a particular media file, make sure it is supported by the playback app or 
device. You can get apps for Windows and mobile devices to convert media files into different for-
mats if necessary.  
 If the content uses DRM, you must play it back on the original device or obtain a license to play it on 
a different device. See the content vendor’s website for details.  
 I Can’t Play Back My Blu-ray Movies  
 Problems with Blu-ray movie playback can be caused by a variety of issues, such as the following:  
•  Not all devices used for playback support high-bandwidth digital copy protection (HDCP).
•  Incorrect or loose cabling between player and HDTV or AV receiver.
•  Outdated firmware.
 Here’s how to deal with these problems.  
 Checking Your Device for HDCP Support  
 If you are unable to play your Blu-ray discs through an AV receiver, but they play correctly when 
the Blu-ray player is connected directly to an HDTV, the AV receiver lacks HDCP support. Check 
for a firmware update for the receiver to add HDCP support. If you can’t get one, use an S/PDIF 
cable from the Blu-ray player to carry digital audio, and use the receiver for audio only until you can 
replace it.  
 If you prefer to play Blu-ray media directly from your PC, some PC displays and video cards lack 
HDCP support. Cyberlink offers its BD & 3D Advisor app to check your computer’s hardware sup-
port. Get it from  http://www.cyberlink.com/prog/bd-support/diagnosis.do . 
 Checking the AV Cable Connections Between Your PC 
or Player and Your Display or HDTV  
 If you connect your Blu-ray player to your HDTV or AV receiver via component video rather than 
HDMI, your playback is limited to 480i (DVD quality) standards. Component video is no longer sup-
ported for Blu-ray playback. If you have an early HDTV that lacks HDMI ports, use it with DVD con-
tent, and get a newer model for use with your Blu-ray player.  

Troubleshooting Home Theater, HDTVs, and Projectors
342
 Upgrading Firmware in Your Blu-ray Player  
 Because Blu-ray players and media use ever-changing versions 
of HDCP to protect content, a Blu-ray player might not be able 
to play the latest movies. You can avoid this problem by making 
sure to connect your Blu-ray player to your network and checking 
for updates periodically.  
 For older Blu-ray players that have upgradeable firmware but lack 
a network connection, check with your vendor for specific firm-
ware upgrade instructions.

 The Blu-ray.com website has 
a listing of older devices and 
links for firmware updates at

 Updating Drivers  
 3D graphics performance depends in large part on three factors:  
•  The performance of your card’s graphics processing unit (GPU) chip, chipset-based integrated
graphics, or CPU-integrated graphics
•  The amount of RAM on your graphics card or available to integrated graphics
•  The drivers used by your card or integrated graphics
 Of these, the only one you can improve without replacing your existing graphics card is the third 
factor: graphics drivers.  
 Manufacturers update graphics drivers to improve performance for specific games and game 
engines, fix rendering problems, and improve stability. Here’s how to update your drivers on a desk-
top computer with a separate (discrete) GPU:  
1.  Determine the manufacturer and model number of your computer’s graphics chip (GPU). We
recommend using TechPowerUp’s GPU-Z available from  www.techpowerup.com/downloads/
SysInfo/GPU-Z/ .  Figure   13.1 illustrates GPU-Z’s report on two computers, one with an AMD
RADEON GPU and the other with an NVIDIA GeForce GTS GPU. On systems with two or more
graphics cards installed, GPU-Z has a selection option at the bottom of the dialog so you can
choose from the installed cards.

Updating Drivers
13
CHAPTER
2.  Download the latest version of the driver for your graphics hard-
ware from the GPU or integrated graphics vendor website.
3.  Install the driver. Reboot your system if prompted to complete
the process.
4.  Review the technical notes for any issues that might affect your
software or system.
 If you have a laptop, an all-in-one touchscreen desktop computer, 
or a desktop computer that uses motherboard or GPU-integrated 
graphics, driver updates might be provided in two ways:  
•  By the computer manufacturer’s website
•  From the graphics hardware manufacturer’s website
 If you cannot get an update from the computer manufacturer’s web-
site, try the graphics hardware vendor’s website.  
 If a graphics driver update fails or causes your system to be unstable, you can revert to your last-
installed driver. Here’s how:  
1.  Open Device Manager from the System properties sheet or Control Panel.
2.  Expand the Display adapters category.
3.  Double-click the display adapter to open its properties sheet.
4.  Click the  Driver tab.
5.  Click the  Roll Back Driver  button ( see Figure   13.2 ).
6.  Click the  Close (X) button to close each dialog after the rollback is complete.
 Tip 
 Both AMD and NVIDIA 
offer automatic detection 
of your hardware and selec-
tion of the best match for 
your hardware. Visit  http://
support.amd.com/en-us for 
AMD RADEON and VISION 
drivers. Visit  www.nvidia.com  
for NVIDIA drivers. Graphics 
drivers are very large, so we 
recommend that you save 
them to your system before 
installing them.

 Adjusting 3D Settings  
 3D settings enable you to control the balance between lifelike 
objects and fast rendering. The more powerful your graphics 
hardware, the more likely it is that you can favor realism in ren-
dering over rendering speed. Whatever your preference, here’s 
how to make those adjustments.  
 AMD 3D Settings  
 AMD provides two ways to adjust 3D settings:  
•  Manually through its CATALYST (for systems with AMD
GPUs) or VISION (for systems with AMD APUs) control centers
for all games.
•  Automatically with AMD Gaming Evolved.
 Here’s how to use CATALYST to tweak overall 3D settings:  
1.  Right-click an empty portion of the Windows desktop and select  AMD Catalyst Control Center .
2.  Click  Gaming .
3.  Click  3D Application Settings . The default menu preference is  Advanced View  (refer to  Figure
 13.3 ), but you can select  Standard View  (refer to  Figure   13.4 ).
4.  Scroll down through the 3D settings. To change a setting, click it and select the option desired.
 You can also configure 3D settings for a particular game:  
1.  After opening the 3D Application Settings dialog, click the  Add button.
2.  Navigate to the location of the game’s executable (.exe) file.
3.  Select it and click  Open .
4.  The game is configured with the same 3D application settings set up for all games. To change it,
click the game and make any changes needed ( see Figure   13.3 ).
5.  Click  Save  to save changes.
 The AMD VISION Control Center used to configure AMD’s APUs 
(processors with integrated RADEON graphics) provides similar 
configuration options, but defaults to Standard View (you can 
also select Advanced View). In Standard View with either Control 
Center, you see a preview of how different 3D graphics settings 
(anti-aliasing methods, modes, and anisotropic filtering) affect a 
typical scene.  Figure   13.4 shows how supersampling antialiasing 
(AA) provides much more detail than multisampling AA.  
 Tip 
 Use the 3D settings dialog to 
set the options you plan to 
use most often. Use game-
specific settings for particular 
games that need different 
settings than normal for bet-
ter performance. If a game 
has settings that do the same 
job as the 3D graphics driver, 
let the application make the 
settings instead of the driver.  
 Note 
 To learn more about 3D 
graphics terms such as anti-
aliasing, multisampling, 
supersampling, anisotropic 
filtering, and tessellation, see

 The NVIDIA GeForce Experience utility is downloaded as part of a GeForce driver update. It enables 
you to view information about your current GPU hardware, stream games to supported mobile 
devices, capture video of your gameplay, and automatically optimize 3D settings for specific games 
based on user recommendations. To learn more, see  www.geforce.com/geforce-experience . 
 In-Game Controls  
 Most 3D games also include in-game controls that can be used to adjust 3D quality.  Figure   13.6

Controlled or  Use Application Settings  if you prefer to set those options in the game. The 3D 
graphics card settings are used for other settings and for games that lack any 3D settings.  
 Installing a Second Graphics Card  
 If you have a single AMD or NVIDIA PCIe graphics card installed, but you have a slot for a sec-
ond card ( Figure   13.7 ), you can speed up your system’s 3D rendering performance by adding an 
additional card that is compatible with your first card. AMD refers to its multi-GPU technology as 
CrossFireX; NVIDIA uses the term SLI (Scalable Link Interface). Both technologies enable two or 
more GPUs to render 3D scenes at rates close to 2 times the single GPU speed.

351
Installing a Second Graphics Card
13
CHAPTER
 To select and install a second graphics card, follow these steps:  
1.  Use GPU-Z (refer to  Figure   13.1 ) to determine the current graphics processing unit (GPU) chip
used on the card in your system. An additional card must be compatible with this card.
2.  Check the NVIDIA or AMD websites to determine which cards are compatible. For AMD, see the
chart link at  http://support.amd.com/en-us/search/faq/108 . For NVIDIA, see the configuration tool
at  www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/sli/system-requirements .
3.  If your cards require an SLI or CrossFire bridge cable, make sure you have one. These cables (see
 Figures   13.9 and   13.11 ) might be provided with a compatible card, a compatible motherboard, or
can be purchased separately.
4.  Before continuing, verify that your motherboard can operate in CrossFireX or SLI mode. Many
motherboards are marked to indicate this. Otherwise, check your motherboard documentation.
5.  If necessary, update the drivers used by your motherboard to the latest version.
6.  Install the latest drivers for your video card.
7.  Check your power supply for CrossFire or SLI compatibility. Compatible power supplies have at
least two six-pin or six+two-pin (eight-pin) PCIe power connectors. See  Figure   7.11 in  Chapter   7 ,
“Desktop Power Supply Troubleshooting,” p.183, for details.
8.  Make sure your power supply has adequate power to run an additional 3D graphics card. See
“Selecting the Right-Sized Power Supply,” in  Chapter   7 for more information.
9.  If your power supply isn’t powerful enough, replace it before installing an additional card.
10.  Turn off the computer and disconnect it from AC power.
11.  Remove the case panel that covers the expansion slots.
12.  Take precautions to avoid ESD, such as wearing an anti-ESD wrist strap that is clipped to a metal
part inside the case.
13.  Unscrew and remove the bracket(s) that correspond to the PCIe x16 card slot. Most cards require
that two brackets be removed to make room for the card and its cooling shroud.
14.  Line up the card (see  Figure   13.8 ) with the expansion slot and push it straight down until it locks
into place.
15.  Screw the brackets into place using the screws removed in step 13.
16.  Connect a six-pin or eight-pin PCIe power lead to the power connector on the card.
17.  Attach the appropriate SLI (see  Figure   13.9 ) or CrossFire (see  Figure   13.11 ) bridge cable (if
needed) to the card.
18.  Close up the computer, reattach AC power, and restart the computer.
 To complete the process, you need to enable the multi-GPU feature in the 3D graphics driver.  

Fixing Slow 3D Gaming
352
 Enabling SLI  
 Except for cards based on the NVIDIA GTX 295, GeForce GTX 590, and GeForce GTX 690 GPUs, you 
need to connect the cards with an SLI bridge cable, such as the one shown in  Figure   13.9 , before 
you finish the installation.  
 After the system restarts, enable SLI in the NVIDIA graphics driver: 
1.  Open the NVIDIA Control Panel.
2.  Open the  3D Settings  menu.
3.  Click or tap  Configure SLI, Surround, PhysX .
4.  Click  Maximize 3D performance  ( see Figure   13.10 ).
5.  Click  Apply .
6.  Close Control Panel.
 After you enable SLI, all 3D programs automatically use it to speed up 3D rendering.

 Overclocking Your Graphics Card  
 No matter how fast your 3D performance is, you might want even faster frame rates. By running 
your graphics card at faster-than-normal speeds, a process called  overclocking , you can achieve 
faster performance. However, overclocking can lead to system instability. In this section, you’ll learn 
about overclocking utilities and how to troubleshoot their use.

CHAPTER
 Depending on the product you use and the features of your GPU and graphics card, you might be 
able to adjust many features, such as the following:  
•  GPU speed
•  Memory clock speed
•  Memory bus speed
•  GPU and memory voltage
 Figure   13.13  illustrates adjusting GPU performance with the AMD Graphics OverDrive utility from 
within the Catalyst Control Center.  
 Figure   13.14  illustrates adjusting GPU performance for a system running two NVIDIA cards in SLI 
mode with MSI Afterburner.  
 Here’s how to use utilities like these to safely improve performance:  
1.  After you start your favorite utility, note the current GPU performance settings. If your utility has
an option to save the current value, use it. Otherwise, you can use screen capture or a digital
camera/smartphone to record the current values.

2.  To improve gaming performance, speed up one of the settings and apply it.
3.  Save or record your changes.
4.  Play a 3D game. If you are able to use your computer and play a 3D game without a video driver
error ( see Figure   13.15 ), overheated system, or onscreen cor-
ruption, use this new setting. You can also try speeding up
another setting. If not, go back to step 2 and reduce the speed 
of the item you changed.  
 Follow this procedure to adjust any values you can change for 
your graphics card. You might need to adjust your GPU voltage (if 
this option is available in your driver) or improve system cooling 
to help your system be more stable at higher GPU speeds.

CHAPTER
 Improving GPU Cooling  
 The GPU chip is one of the hottest-running components inside your computer. Although overclock-
friendly graphics cards are usually fitted with large fans and fan shrouds to help keep the card’s 
memory and GPU cool, overclocking while 3D gaming pushes cards to the limits of stability. 
Fortunately, there are some low-cost ways to help keep your system running as cool as possible:  
•  Keep air intakes and exhausts clean of dust, debris, and pet
hair.
•  Add additional case fans to the front and top of your system if
they’re not present.
•  Keep the slots next to the fan side of each graphics card open to
help avoid heat buildups.
 If you have already added fans to your system, keep your intakes and exhaust clean, and you’re 
still having problems with GPU overheating, consider keeping the slots next to your graphics cards 
unused. 
 Let’s take a look at the system shown in  Figure   13.16 . 
 If you want to keep the slots next to both cards empty, the only usable expansion slot remaining is 
the slot to the right of the original graphics card (not visible in these photos). Although most expan-
sion devices today connect via USB, some users might still need to add high-performance sound 
cards or specialized network adapters via an internal slot.

 Improving Your Display  
 The display you use also has an effect on the quality of your 3D gaming. If you decide that you need 
to upgrade to a better display, the critical technologies to look for include LED displays with in-
plane switching (IPS) and LED HDTVs with refresh rates of 120Hz or faster.  
 Upgrading to IPS LED Displays  
 In-plane switching (IPS) enables a much wider viewing angle than previous technologies such as 
Twisted Nematic (TN): 178 degrees horizontal and vertical, compared to 160 degrees vertical and 
170 degrees horizontal.  
 Higher-quality IPS displays can display more than 1 billion colors, compared to 16.7 million colors 
with LCD TN and lower-quality LED IPS displays.  
 Keep in mind that IPS displays vary widely in their connectivity. Low-cost models and almost all 
LCD TN displays still on the market typically have only DVI-D digital and VGA analog connections. 
Higher-cost units typically add HDMI and additional connections for more flexibility. 
 Before purchasing a replacement display, check the following:  
•  Screen size—We recommend 22-inch or larger diagonal measurement unless your space is
limited.

CHAPTER
•  Viewing angles—Wider is better.
•  Connection types—We recommend support for HDMI and VGA, or DVI-D and VGA.
•  Support for HDCP—This feature helps assure that you can use the display to watch Blu-ray
movies.
•  Refresh rate—Faster is better for gaming.
•  Compliance with VESA wall or table mounts—By using a VESA wall or table mount, you can
put your display in more places.
•  Warranty—A longer warranty is better, but be sure to look into how warranty claims are
handled.
•  User ratings—User ratings help you cut through manufacturers’ hype to see how products really
work in the field.
 Faster-Response HDTVs  
 Although you could watch movies and sports on your PC’s display, 
it’s more likely that you’ll be enjoying video and TV content on 
your HDTV. To avoid blurring during fast-moving sports or action 
sequences, look for LED HDTVs with a refresh rate of 120Hz or 
faster. If you want to enjoy 3D Blu-ray content, look for displays 
designed specifically for 3D.  
 Note 
 3D support also requires a 
3D-compatible Blu-ray player, 
high-speed HDMI cable, and 
a receiver that has 3D HDMI 
passthrough.

 Using Windows Update  
 Whether you’re looking for better security, more stability, or a new feature or two for the version of 
Windows you run, Windows Update is your friend. However, if your work patterns don’t match the 
way Microsoft thinks you should use it, Windows Update can also drive you crazy. In this section, 
we’ll show you how to make Windows Update work for you.  
 Normal Settings for Windows Update  
 Whether you use Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8/8.1, the normal settings for Windows 
Update put Microsoft in charge of when you get updates:  
•  Microsoft posts important updates (formerly known as “critical”) monthly on “Patch Tuesday,”
the second Tuesday of each month; these are downloaded and installed automatically. If there
are immediate threats to Windows, Microsoft will post them as needed.
•  Recommended updates are also posted at various times as needed; these are also downloaded
and installed automatically.
•  Microsoft offers optional hardware and Windows updates you can choose from. These are not
installed automatically.
 Windows Update typically runs in the wee hours of the morning (2:00 a.m.). After updates are 
downloaded and installed, your system may need to be rebooted. Windows Update takes care of 
that for you.  
 Keeping your system updated helps protect your computer from malware and attacks. This is espe-
cially the case with Windows 8/8.1, which uses Windows Defender as its built-in anti-malware app. 
If you didn’t use Windows Update, Windows Defender wouldn’t be updated either.  
 So what’s the problem? There are a few situations in which Windows Update is doing you no favors 
with its default settings:  
•  If you are running backups overnight, Windows Update can interfere with them.
•  When your system is rebooted after being updated, any remote-access sessions you are running
are dropped.
•  If you also run updates to other software overnight, Windows Update might interrupt those pro-
cesses as well.
•  Depending on the updates it installs, Windows Update may need to make lots of changes to your
system after you shut it down. If you’re turning off your system to make a run for the airport,
needing to wait five or ten minutes or even longer for Windows Update to install updates could
make you late for your appointment or your flight.
 Fortunately, you can tweak Windows Update to keep your system protected without getting in your 
way. The next sections look at the options for Windows Update and show you your choices.

 With Windows 7, you can also select when to install new updates—every day, or a selected day of 
the week—and you can select the time. These options are not present in Windows 8/8.1. However, 
Windows 8/8.1’s version of Windows Update does not reboot your computer as soon as updates are 
installed, but waits a day or so before doing so.  
 If you want to control when to install updates but want to make sure you get all the important and 
recommended updates for your system, I recommend selecting the Download Updates but Let Me 
Choose Whether to Install Them setting.  
 If you frequently run backups or update other software overnight 
on Windows 7, consider changing the default time for Windows 
Update to run.  
 Enabling Microsoft Update  
 Windows Update can also bring you updates for additional 
Microsoft programs, such as Microsoft Office, Microsoft Security 
Essentials, and other programs. This feature is called Microsoft 
Update. To enable it, make sure the check boxes for Microsoft 
Update are clicked. In  Figure   14.2 , Microsoft Update is enabled. To enable it on the system shown in 
 Figure   14.4 , click the empty check box.  
 Depending on your current system configuration, the Microsoft Update check box might not be 
displayed. If you see a dialog similar to the one in  Figure   14.5 when you start Windows Update 
in Windows 7 (or start it from Control Panel in Windows 8/8.1), you don’t have Microsoft Update 
enabled. 
 To fix the problem:  
1.  Click the  Find Out More  link shown in  Figure   14.5 .
2.  Click the empty  I Agree  box ( see Figure   14.6 ).
3.  Click  Install .
 Note 
 Windows 8/8.1 downloads 
updates in the background 
(unless you’re on a metered 
connection) and lets you 
know when they’re ready to 
install. 
 Caution 
 If you use Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), the free anti-malware package for Windows 7 and earlier 
versions, keep in mind that Microsoft Update labels updates for MSE as Optional. In other words, you must 
select them manually or wait until Microsoft Security Essentials decides to update itself. If you decide not 
to use Automatic Updates, I recommend that you check for updates daily and select updates for MSE when-
ever you see them to keep MSE up-to-date as quickly as possible.

 Installing Updates Manually  
 Sooner or later, every important or recommended Microsoft update for Windows (and for supported 
apps if you have turned on Microsoft Update) will be delivered to you via Windows Update. But, if 
there’s a major problem with your system or a newly announced cyber attack that an update can fix, 
why wait? You can check for updates whenever you want with Windows Update or, if you need a 
service pack for Windows or for Microsoft Office, download it manually.  
 To check for updates manually with Windows Update in Windows 7, follow this procedure:  
1.  Click  Check for Updates  from the dialog shown in  Figure   14.1 .
2.  Windows Update indicates whether any updates are available ( see Figure   14.7 ). It automatically
selects important updates for installation.
3.  If you click the  Install Updates  button shown in  Figure   14.7 , only important updates will be
installed. Optional updates won’t be. Instead, I recommend that you click the link to view the
optional updates so you can decide if you need any of them.
4.  When you click the link to view optional updates, the optional updates are listed by category.
5.  Click the empty check boxes next to the updates you want. In  Figure   14.8 , the update for
Microsoft Security Essentials has been selected.

 Getting Service Packs  
 Although both Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office are frequently updated via Windows 
Update, it is sometimes better to get most of the updates you need by installing a service pack. A 
service pack is a large file (typically more than 100MB in size) that contains all the updates for the 
program or operating system in question. If you install a version of Windows or Office that does not 
include the latest service pack, download and install the latest service pack right after installation to 
limit the number of updates you need to get via Windows Update or Microsoft Update.  
 To determine whether your version of Windows includes a service pack:  
 For Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 desktop:  
•  Open the System properties sheet via the Control Panel or by right-clicking  Computer (My PC)
and selecting  Properties .  Figure   14.12  shows a system running Windows 7 with Service Pack 1
installed.

CHAPTER
 For Windows 8.1 from the Start screen, if you have a keyboard:  
•  Press the Windows Logo key+X, and then  System.
 If you are using a tablet (no keyboard):  
•  Open the Charms menu, click Settings, Change PC Settings, PC and Devices, PC Info.
•  Figure   14.13 shows a system running Windows 8.1 with no service packs.
 To see whether Microsoft Office has a service pack installed (and which one), see the following 
links: 
•  For Office 2013:  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2817457
•  For Office 2010:  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2687455
•  For Office 2007:  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928116
 If your version of Microsoft Office doesn’t have the latest service pack included, you need to install 
only the latest service pack (it includes the contents of previous service packs). Depending on when 
the latest service pack was created, there probably will be additional updates needed via Windows 
Update.

 To download and install a Microsoft Windows service pack, visit  www.microsoft.com , open the 
Support menu, click Windows, and use the Search tool to locate a specific service pack.  
 Using Vendor-Supplied Update Tools  
 Most third-party programs and apps for Windows include some type of update process. Some enable 
this feature automatically during installation, whereas others require you to update manually.  Figure 
 14.14  shows the update dialog for ImgBurn, a popular CD/DVD mastering program. ImgBurn checks 
automatically for updates and prompts you to update as needed.  
 Tip 
 Another benefit of using the download method to get a service pack is that if you need to install an Office 
or Windows service pack on more than one computer, you need to download the file only once. Put the file 
on a removable-media drive, CD, or DVD, and you can use it on as many systems as needed.  
 Caution 
 Be sure to choose the 32-bit (x86) version of a service pack if you are using a 32-bit version of Windows or 
Microsoft Office (most Microsoft Office installations in use are 32-bit, even on computers running 64-bit 
Windows). Be sure to choose the 64-bit (x64) version of a service pack if you are using a 64-bit version of 
Windows or Microsoft Office (most recent laptops and desktops use 64-bit Windows, whereas many tablets 
use 32-bit Windows).

 If you are not sure how your programs or apps are updated, check the Help dialogs. If you don’t see 
an update option, you can search Help for more information.  Figure   14.15 shows the update option 
in the Help menu for Camtasia Studio, a popular motion-screen capture utility.  
 You will be prompted if you need to close your application before the update is installed. 
 Note 
 One typical benefit of using paid instead of free versions of anti-malware and other utilities is better pro-
tection through automatic updates. If you’re the forgetful type, it might be worthwhile to upgrade to paid 
versions of your favorite utilities for this feature alone.

 Caution 
 Is this update necessary? Generally speaking, security updates for Windows or apps (software) should be 
installed as soon as you can. However, updates for apps or drivers or major updates or service packs for 
Windows don’t need to be updated immediately unless they specifically deal with a problem you’re having. 
By waiting, you can discover if other users are having problems with the update. If the update causes prob-
lems, don’t install it until the problems are resolved.  
 To determine whether an update is causing problems, check the support forums for the app or for 
Windows. Microsoft’s support forums are located at  http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us .

 Updating Device Drivers  
 Device drivers enable your hardware, from mice and keyboards to multifunction devices and dis-
plays, to work with your operating system. If a driver stops working correctly, you can get updated 
drivers. In recent versions of Windows, there are four ways to get updated device drivers:  
•  Windows Update
•  The Update Driver button in a device’s Device Manager properties sheet
•  Right-clicking a device in Device Manager and selecting Update driver software
•  Downloading it from the vendor’s website
 For device drivers for USB ports, displays, network adapters, and storage devices, Windows Update 
is the preferred way to get updated drivers. However, Windows Update doesn’t always display 
GPU (video card or chipset) updates on a timely basis. Gamers need updates to support the newest 
games, help improve 3D performance, and solve display problems. Instead, use these methods:  
•  For systems with AMD GPUs or with AMD graphics integrated into the CPU (an APU), use the
AMD Driver Autodetect tool to determine the best driver for your GPU:  http://support.amd.com/
en-us/download/auto-detect-tool .
•  For systems with NVIDIA GPUs, use the GeForce Experience
utility installed on your system to determine the best driver for
your GPU.
•  For systems with Intel integrated graphics, use the Driver
Update Utility to see whether you can use generic Intel graph-
ics drivers on your system or must get them from your com-
puter vendor:  http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/detect/
graphics .
 Rolling Back Bad Driver Updates  
 Although the Update Driver button on the Driver tab of a device’s Device Manager properties sheet

CHAPTER
 Updating iOS Devices  
 Updates to your iOS App Store apps or iOS itself can help improve stability and add features. Your 
iOS device (iPad, iPod Touch, or iPhone) can perform updates in one of two ways:  
•  Automatically
•  Advise you of updates and let you choose when to install them
 The latter method is preferred, especially if you don’t use Wi-Fi connections very often, because 
running a lot of automatic updates on a cellular connection could make your device exceed your 
account’s data limits.  
 To determine whether your device needs updates, check the icons for the App Store and Settings 
(typically visible as soon as you unlock your device). In  Figure   14.17 , we can see that 34 updates are 
available for apps in the App Store, and there’s also a system update.  
 To update App Store apps, follow these steps:  
1.  Tap the  App Store  icon shown in  Figure   14.17  .
2.  Tap the  Updates icon when App Store opens.
3.  To see what’s new (iPhone/iPod Touch only), click the  What’s New  arrow to see a brief descrip-
tion of changes. If you are updating an iPad, the description appears automatically.

 Troubleshooting Slow System 
Performance  
 Although many components affect system performance, such as the graph-
ics card and hard disk, perhaps the two most important components affect-
ing system performance are the memory and the processor (CPU). Although 
processor upgrades often require motherboard changes on desktop com-
puters and can’t be performed on notebook computers, virtually every 
computer can benefit from added memory. Adding memory is not only one 
of the best ways to boost performance, but it is also one of the least expen-
sive. How can you tell if you need to add memory? Here are some signs that 
your system may have a memory shortage:  

Dealing with Contrary Memory
388
•  You see the Windows “I’m busy” hula hoop or ball-bearing loop appear frequently when you
have multiple program windows open.
•  The hard disk activity light is blinking furiously as you work.
•  Switching between programs takes measurable time instead of being instantaneous.
•  When you open a new folder, Windows takes several seconds to display the icons inside.
 Is a lack of RAM (random access memory) really the problem? Use the following methods to deter-
mine whether the performance bottleneck is caused by a lack of system memory:  
•  Determine the amount of memory you currently have installed on your system.
•  Determine how many programs you run at the same time (on average).
•  Check the performance of your system.
 To find out how much physical memory is available to Windows (and how fast your processor is, 
too), use one of these methods:  
 For Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1 (Windows Desktop): right-click  Computer  and select  Properties . 
This displays the System Properties dialog, as shown in  Figure   15.1 .

 From Windows 8/8.1, you can also press the Windows logo key and 
the letter X, and then click  System . 
 If you prefer to use the touchscreen in Windows 8.1:  
1.  Open the  Charms  menu.
2.  Tap  Settings .
3.  Tap  Change PC Settings .
4.  Tap  PC and Devices.
5.  Tap  PC Info  (see  Figure   15.2 ).
 According to memory vendor Crucial.com, the amount of RAM memory you need in your system 
varies with the types of tasks you perform. We’ve adapted their recommendations 
(see  http://www.crucial.com/support/howmuch.aspx ) for  Table   15.2 to help you plan your upgrades.  
 Note 
 Depending on your comput-
er’s specific hardware, System 
Properties might be able to 
identify your system’s brand 
and model number (as shown 
in  Figure   15.1 ).

 As you compare your system’s memory size and Windows edition to the recommendations in  Table 
 15.2 , there are two notable factors to keep in mind:  
•  As you perform more complex tasks or need to multitask, the likelihood of a RAM upgrade
increases.
•  If you use a 32-bit edition of Windows, your maximum memory size (and therefore the perfor-
mance of your system) is limited.
 Note 
 32-bit editions of Windows cannot use more than 4GB of RAM. In addition, memory over 3GB can conflict
with installed devices that also use memory spaces. If you need 4GB of RAM or more, you need a computer
with a 64-bit processor running a 64-bit edition of Windows. System Properties identifies your processor
type and Windows edition.

391
Choosing a Memory Upgrade
15
CHAPTER
 If you purchased a new laptop or desktop in the past three or four years, chances are you’re using a 
64-bit edition of Windows. In that case, the amount of RAM you can install is dictated by the design
of your system’s motherboard. However, if you have a Windows tablet, you might have two limita-
tions to deal with: many low-cost Windows tablets use a low-powered 32-bit ATOM processor with
nonexpandable memory (usually 2GB). As  Table   15.2   suggests, these are great for casual use, but if
you’re planning to edit photos or videos, you need a system with a
faster processor and  more RAM.  
 Keep in mind that if your computer runs out of actual RAM, it will 
use its  virtual  memory, which is stored in a file called the  page file 
(also called the  swapfile ). The page file is an area of free space 
on your hard disk that the computer treats like additional RAM. 
Unfortunately, the difference between accessing data from system 
RAM and your hard drive is like the difference between making 
photocopies in your office or driving across town to an office supply 
store for copies. It’s a very slow substitute.  
 Choosing a Memory Upgrade  
 Although all PCs use RAM, you can’t go into a retail store and simply ask for “RAM.” Desktop 
computers use various types of DIMM memory modules, whereas laptops and all-in-one computers 
use reduced-size versions known as small outline DIMMs (SODIMMs). Both DIMMs and SODIMMs 
are available in various sizes, speeds, and memory technologies customized for specific computers. 
 Figure   15.3   illustrates typical laptop memory modules, and  Figure   15.4 illustrates typical desktop 
memory modules. Most recent laptop and all-in-one computers use two SODIMM modules, whereas 
desktop computers can use two, three, or four DIMM modules.  
 To make sure you get the right memory for your computer, I recommend one of the following 
methods: 
•  Use a memory configuration program provided by the memory vendor.
•  Look up your computer brand and model on a memory vendor’s website.
 Although you can purchase memory from your computer manufacturer, I generally recommend using 
a major memory vendor instead. You can get a wider variety of options at lower prices, and com-
puter manufacturers get their RAM from the same vendors.  
 Crucial.com offers a memory configuration program that runs from your web browser to detect your 
specific system, current memory configuration, and suggested upgrades. Crucial also offers a data-
base of systems you can check. Other major memory vendors typically offer only a database of sys-
tems you can review to locate recommended memory.  
 I recommend using a memory configuration program because I have found it can be very difficult to 
locate the exact model number of your system, and even after you do, many system database list-
ings are incomplete and you might not find your particular model listed. This is a particular problem 
with laptop computers.  
 Tip 
 To help prevent your system 
from running out of physical 
RAM, close programs you are 
not using. If your system is 
short of physical RAM, hav-
ing fewer programs will help 
your system switch between 
programs faster.

CHAPTER
 Here’s how to use a memory configuration program (in this example, we’ll use the Crucial.com 
version): 
1.  Go to the memory vendor’s website.
2.  Click the link to the memory configuration program (Crucial calls theirs “System Scanner”).
3.  Follow the instructions onscreen to download and run the scanning program.
4.  After the program runs, you will see your current configuration and upgrade options.
 Figure   15.5   lists the results of a scan of an HP TouchSmart 310-1125f touchscreen computer. It 
has 4GB currently installed as two 2GB modules. The recommended upgrade is 8GB as two 4GB 
modules.

 If you prefer to purchase memory from another vendor, you can use the technical information shown 
as part of the memory description to look up comparable modules.  
 Upgrading to Faster Memory  
 Memory is rated by speed. Changing to faster memory can improve system performance if you are 
planning to overclock your system (run the processor, memory, or other components at faster-than-
normal speeds) or if you are customizing your system with other upgrades, such as a faster proces-
sor. 
 If you’re a gamer or looking for maximum performance for video editing or 3D rendering, memory 
speed can be a big deal. For web surfing or home budgeting, not so much.  
 If you are purchasing memory for a “white-box” computer, check the recommended memory speci-
fications for the motherboard and processor that are installed (or that you are planning to upgrade 
to). When you look up your motherboard or run a memory configuration program, you will typically 
see a range of memory speeds as well as sizes offered. To help “future-proof” a system you might 
overclock or upgrade to a faster processor, choose the fastest and largest combination of memory 
you can afford.  
 In  Figure   15.6 , the Crucial System Scanner recommended upgrading from 16GB to 32GB of RAM, 
and it noted that my system can use memory of three different speeds: PC3-12800 (recommended), 
PC3-10600, and PC3-14900. I could add 16GB (two 8GB modules) to my current memory or replace 
all memory with 32GB (four 8GB modules).  
 If I want to do 3D rendering or HD video editing while running other programs, the upgrade from 
16GB to 32GB is a good deal. Because the System Scanner checked the installed memory in my sys-
tem, it was able to recommend memory that will work with my existing memory.  
 Note 
 Information such as type (DDR3), speed (PC3-10600 and DDR-1333), timing (CL9), voltage (1.35V DC), and 
internal design (512Meg × 64) are critical in finding comparable modules. Look up the module part number 
if you are not sure if the memory is standard-size DIMMs or SODIMMs.

CHAPTER
 When to Choose High-Performance Memory  
 Standard memory modules are designed to run at standard speeds. However, if you are planning to 
overclock your system, consider buying memory that is not only faster, but is designed to help main-
tain reliable performance when run at faster-than-normal speeds.  
 Figure   15.7   compares a standard Kingston DDR3 module (top) to two modules made for overclock-
ing: Crucial Ballistix Sport (middle) and G.Skill Ripjaws (bottom). The heat spreaders over the RAM 
modules on the Crucial module and the finned heat sinks on the G.Skill module dissipate heat to 
prevent lockups or crashes.

 Removing and Installing Memory Modules  
 Before you install a memory module, get ready to do it safely:  
1.  Disconnect the system from electrical power. If you are installing memory into a laptop, also
remove the battery.
2.  Remove the system cover (desktop) or memory compartment cover (laptop).
3.  Put on an antistatic wrist strap and use the alligator clip to connect to a metal part inside the
computer.
 Removing and Installing SODIMMs  
 Because most laptops or all-in-one computers have no more than two SODIMM sockets, it’s often 
necessary to remove one or both SODIMMs before you can install a memory upgrade. To remove an 
SODIMM module on a laptop or all-in-one computer, follow these steps: 
1.  Push the securing clips on either side of the module away from the module (see  Figure   15.8 ).
2.  Swing the module up (see  Figure   15.9 ).
3.  Remove the module (see  Figure   15.10 ).

 Caution 
 Whether you’re installing DIMMs or SODIMMs, don’t force the module into place. You can break a module 
if it’s not properly aligned with the socket. When you install an SODIMM, it’s very important to insert the 
module completely into the socket before pushing it into place (review  Figure   15.10 ).

 After the memory is installed, follow these steps:  
1.  Remove the antistatic wrist band’s alligator clip from the com-
puter.
2.  Close up the computer, and fasten the case or memory socket
cover into position with the appropriate screws.
3.  Restart the computer.
 Signs of Memory Problems  
 The RAM in your desktop or laptop computer is the workspace used by your operating system and 
your apps to get work done. Until you save a new document, photo, video, or music clip or save your 
changes to an existing one, your work resides in memory only. If your system locks up or crashes 
before you save your work, you’ve lost it. Memory that’s not working correctly can cause a variety of 
problems, including the following:  
•  System lockups and crashes, especially after the system has been running for a while.
•  The system powers up when you turn it on but won’t boot to the operating system.
•  The system might beep and not boot to the operating system.
•  The amount of installed RAM does not correspond to the amount displayed in System Properties.
 When a system locks up during operation, the problem could be memory related, but it could also 
be attributable to problems with other hardware, with viruses, or with Windows. The contents of 
memory can be corrupted by excessive heat or by problems with the system power supply.  
 To learn more about detecting problems with your system’s power supply, see “Testing
the Power Supply,”  Chapter   7 ,  p.176 . 
 To learn more about reducing heat buildup inside your system, see “Keeping Your
Desktop Computer Cool,”  Chapter   16 , p.406.  
 To learn about detecting and removing malware, see  Chapter   4 , “Curing Malware and
Stopping Scams,” p.109.  
 Caution 
 With some computers, you 
will be prompted to rerun 
BIOS setup if the memory size 
has changed. As soon as the 
BIOS setup program displays 
the main menu, save the new 
settings and exit. Your system 
will restart and boot to the 
operating system.  

401
Testing Memory
15
CHAPTER
 Although your computer might perform a quick memory test with its Power-On Self-Test (POST) pro-
cess when you turn it on, you can test installed memory with a memory-testing program. A memory-
testing program does a much more thorough job of looking for memory problems than the BIOS can.  
 Finding a Defective Memory Module  
 If you can turn on your computer but it won’t start—it won’t even display the prompt to open the 
BIOS setup menu—a bad memory module is very likely the cause.  
 To determine whether you have a bad memory module installed, follow these steps:  
1.  Follow the instructions for removing a module from your system.
2.  Leave the module that is closest to the processor or the motherboard.
3.  Follow the instructions for closing up the system and restarting it.
4.  If your system starts, the module you removed is defective. Replace it.
5.  If your system does not start, go back to step 1, remove the module you left in the system, and
install the module you removed. Follow step 3. If the system starts, the module you just removed
is defective.
 Testing Memory  
 If your system boots but you suspect that your computer’s RAM is not working correctly (for 
example, you experience system crashes and lockups), you can use a variety of testing programs to 
check it. Windows versions 7/8/8.1 include Windows Memory Diagnostic, which can be run from the 
Administrative Tools folder in System and Security, which is in the Control Panel ( see Figure   15.12 ). 
You can run the test immediately or the next time you restart the computer.  
 During the test process ( see Figure   15.13 ), you can change the number of times the tests run 
(default is twice) and select the testing level by pressing the F1 key, selecting the option(s) desired, 
and pressing F10 to apply them. After the tests are over, the results are provided when you boot to 
the Windows desktop.  
 If you need to test memory on systems that run Linux or MacOS as well as Windows, try Passmark 
Software’s free Memtest86 ( www.memtest86.com ). Passmark Software is a leading developer of 
benchmark software for PCs.  
 If the memory test locates defective memory, follow these instructions to determine which module is 
defective: 
1.  Follow the instructions for removing a module from your system.
2.  Leave the module that is closest to the processor or the motherboard.
3.  Follow the instructions for closing up the system and restarting it.
4.  Restart your computer and rerun the memory test.
5.  If the memory test shows no errors, the module you removed is defective. Replace it.

 What Excessive Heat Does to Your Device  
 Whether you’re using a tablet, a smartphone, a laptop, or a desktop PC, heat is not your friend—or 
your device’s friend, either. Excessive heat can cause your device to slow down to cool off, its noise 
levels (due to fan noise) to increase, its battery life to drop, and its operation to become less stable, 
which can crash your device, and, in extreme cases, cause it to fail.  
 So, keeping your device cool during operation is a really good idea. In this chapter, we’ll show you 
how to avoid overheating to keep your devices, your data, and you very happy.  
 Keeping Your Desktop Computer Cool  
 From multiple high-performance 3D video cards and multiple memory modules to fast multicore pro-
cessors and the voltage regulators they use for power, desktop computers have the greatest poten-
tial to run hot because of the heat-producing components onboard.  
 Your desktop computer relies on airflow through the case to keep its components cool. In addition 
to the fan in the power supply and the fan/heat sink on the processor, most desktop computers have 
a rear-mounted fan to pull hot air out of the computer, and most have provisions for additional fans. 
Many video cards also have cooling fans (see  Figure   16.1 ).

CHAPTER
 If any of these fans fail, your system will probably overheat, causing the system to slow down or 
stop. Thus, keeping an eye on fan speeds and temperature is very important. There are two ways to 
check this information: system BIOS features and programs that run after Windows starts.  
 Checking Fan Speeds and System Temperatures with 
the System BIOS  
 The system BIOS on most desktop computers includes a feature that displays processor and moth-
erboard temperatures and fan speeds. It’s often referred to as System Monitor or PC Health.  Figure 
 16.2  and   16.3  provide two typical examples of this information.  
 Note that the system shown in  Figure   16.2 does not display fan speeds for chassis-mounted fans 
(SYS FAN1, SYS FAN2). Compare that to the information shown for fan speeds in  Figure   16.3 . 
 How does the system pictured in  Figure   16.3 know that these fans are working? Does the system 
pictured in  Figure   16.2 have defective fans, or no fans? To find out, let’s take a closer look at how 
fans connect to the motherboard.

 Fan Connections on the Motherboard  
 A typical desktop computer’s motherboard has two types of fan connectors: a four-pin connector for 
the processor (CPU) fan and one or more three-pin connectors for system fans (fans mounted on the 
front, top, or rear of the case).  Figure   16.4   illustrates how these connections look before and after 
fans are connected to them.  
 The CPU fan connector (front) has a ground wire, a +12V DC power wire, a fan speed (also known 
as fan tachometer) wire, and a fan control wire (controls fan speed). The system fan connector (rear) 
has the first three wires but lacks a fan control wire.  
 If you decide to add fans, you should connect additional fans to the system fan connections to the 
motherboard—until you run out of them.  
 Some system fans are not connected to the motherboard. Instead, 
they get their power from a four-pin Molex power connector 
( Figure   16.5 ). Older fans used only the Molex connector, whereas 
newer fans like the one in  Figure   16.5 are designed to use the 
three-pin motherboard power connector or a Molex connector. 
When a Molex connector is used, a single-wire connector is pro-
vided to connect to the motherboard for fan monitoring.  
 If the single-wire connector isn’t plugged into a system fan 
header on the motherboard (for example, if no headers are left

 Troubleshooting Fan Failures  
 If a fan is connected to the motherboard and is monitored by the BIOS, you can use the PC Health 
Status or Hardware Monitor dialog to determine if the fan has failed. If a case fan starts dropping in 
speed or if either fan starts turning much more slowly than normal, suspect fan failure.  
 If there is no RPM readout, shut down the computer, turn off the power supply, and try to hand turn 
the fan. A working fan turns freely; a defective fan won’t turn or turns only with effort. Use this 
method to diagnose fans that are not monitored by the BIOS.  
 See the section “Adding Additional Fans,” later in this chapter, to learn how to replace case fans. 
See the section “Using Third-Party Heat Sinks and Fans,” in this chapter, to learn how to replace the 
processor (CPU) fan and heat sink.  
 Using Desktop Health Monitoring Software  
 Some retail store computers and motherboards include desktop health monitoring software. These 
programs display the information gathered by the system BIOS while you run Windows so you don’t 
need to restart your system to see temperature, fan speed, or voltage information. Some programs 
display additional technical information.  
 If your system didn’t include this type of software, you can download monitoring packages from 
third-party vendors. You can get a sample of CPUID’s HW Monitor Pro at  http://www.cpuid.com/
softwares/hwmonitor.html .  Figure   16.6 illustrates a typical report from the trial version. The licensed 
version displays information in place of the word TRIAL.

 If you prefer a free, open source product, the Open Hardware 
Monitor is available at  www.openhardwaremonitor.org  (see 
 Figure   16.7  ). Although it provides somewhat less detail than 
HWMonitorPRO, it provides the essential information you need 
about system cooling.  
 Adding and Replacing Fans  
 Because fans are called upon to pull air through your system, making your computer into a sort of 
low-efficiency vacuum cleaner, system fans may fail over time. Fans that use ball bearings last lon-
ger than sleeve-bearing fans, but both types may eventually fail.  
  Selecting a Replacement (or New) Fan  
 Here’s how to select a replacement fan:  
1.  Determine the size of the fan (in mm). Older systems or those with small cases typically use
80mm or 92mm diameter fans, and late-model mid-size and full-size systems use 120mm, 140mm,
or even 200mm fans.  Figure   16.8   compares 120mm and 140mm fans. Use a measuring stick or
tape to determine the width of one side of the fan (for a square opening) or the short and long

sides of a fan (for a rectangular opening). If there is limited clearance between between the fan 
opening and components on the inside of the case, be sure to measure the distance between the  
fan opening and components that might interfere with fan mounting.   
2.  When you shop for a replacement fan, the noise level (dBA), airflow (CFM), and bearing type (ball
bearing preferred) are important considerations. If you overclock your system (run it at faster
than normal speeds) or play high-performance 3D games, get fans that have higher CFM (cubic
feet per minute) ratings. if you are in an office environment and not overclocking or playing 3D
games, look for quiet operation (lower decibel [dBA] values).
3.  If you want to use your motherboard to monitor your fan speed, make sure the fan includes either
a three-pin fan connector (power plus monitor) or a four-pin Molex drive power connector with a
one-pin fan connector (monitor).
 If you are buying an additional fan for your system, check the diameter of the fan opening you are 
planning to use in step 1. Steps 2 and 3 are the same.

CHAPTER
  Removing and Installing a Case Fan  
 To remove an old fan, follow this procedure:  
1.  Shut down the computer and unplug it.
2.  Open the case.
3.  Note where the fan is connected to the computer (motherboard, four-pin Molex power connector,
or both).
4.  Carefully disconnect these wires from the motherboard or power cable.
5.  Locate the screws that hold the fan in place.
6.  Remove these screws: hold the fan so it doesn’t fall inside the case and damage other compo-
nents.
7.  Remove the fan from the case.
 To install a new or replacement fan, follow this procedure:  
1.  Shut down the computer and unplug it.
2.  Open the case.
3.  Locate the screws packaged with the fan. Most cooling fans use a short-barreled screw like the
ones shown in  Figure   16.9 .
4.  Hold the fan inside the fan opening in the case with the wiring harness toward the inside.
5.  Use the screws to fasten the fan in place: one screw to each corner ( Figure   16.10 ).
6.  Connect the fan to the motherboard (preferred) or to a four-pin Molex connector (refer to  Figures
 16.4  and   16.5 ). If the old fan was not connected to the motherboard, but there is a monitored fan
header available (SYS Fan 1 or SYS Fan 2) and your new fan can use it, connect your fan to that
header.
7.  Close the case, plug in the power supply, and restart the computer.
 Note 
 Larger fans can spin more slowly to provide comparable or superior airflow. For example, a 92mm Antec 
case fan spins at 2600 RPM, has a noise level of 33 dBA, and features air flow of 42.4 CFM.  
 A 120mm Antec TriCool three-speed case fan lets you strike a balance between high-performance cooling 
and a lower noise level:  
  •  1200 RPM/25 dBA/39 CFM
  •  1600 RPM/28 dBA/56 CFM
  •  2000 RPM/30 dBA/79 CFM
 Virtually any fan you choose for your system will cost less than $20, a small price to pay for better cooling 
and longer, more reliable, system life.

CHAPTER
 Using Third-Party Active Heat Sinks for Your Processor  
 Almost all computers use a combination of a heat sink (a metal 
assembly with fins to dissipate heat) and a fan to keep the proces-
sor (CPU chip) cool. This type of cooler is called an active heat sink.  
 You might want a better active heat sink for your processor than 
the one it was supplied with. Why change?  
•  You might want better cooling for overclocking.
•  Third-party heat sinks are often better looking than the OEM versions (especially important if
you use a clear-sided case).
 There are no shortages of third-party active heat sinks you can choose. If the fan fails on your cur-
rent active heat sink, you can get an exact replacement or take the opportunity to move up to a 
replacement.  
 Before you make the change, keep these factors in mind:  
•  Make sure the replacement works with your processor.
•  If you’re interested in overclocking, try to find reviews of the active heat sink in use to determine
how it does with an overclocked system.
•  Check the free space around the processor socket. Third-party active heat sinks are typically
taller and wider than OEM versions.
•  You will need to remove the old active heat sink and remove the thermal grease or phase-change
material from the top of the processor. Use 91% alcohol or pure alcohol to remove this residue.
•  Find out whether the new active heat sink comes with thermal
grease. If not, you can purchase this separately. You will need
to use thermal grease between the top of the processor and the
bottom of the heat sink to enable the heat sink to work prop-
erly. Follow the heat sink or processor vendor’s instructions for
details.
•  Many replacement heat sinks require you to remove the moth-
erboard to install special hardware to hold the new heat sink in
place.
 Figure   16.11   compares an OEM Intel heat sink for a Core i5 proces-
sor with a Cooler Master Hyper 212 (the current model, the Hyper 
212 Plus, looks similar but includes support for additional Intel 
processors and improved heat pipes). The Cooler Master model is 
much taller, features many more fins, and has a removable fan for 
easy modification.  
 The Intel active heat sink has expandable pegs that fit into holes on the motherboard. The Cooler 
Master active heat sink uses a separate X-shaped clip ( Figure   16.12 ) and a back plate that fits on the 
bottom of the motherboard. You’ll need to remove the motherboard to install it ( Figure   16.13 ). 
 Note 
 Some video (3D graphics) 
cards also use active heat 
sinks for cooling.  
 Caution 
 When I installed the third-
party active heat sink fea-
tured in this section, the fan 
prevented a memory module 
from properly locking into 
place on my motherboard. I 
had to move the fan to the 
other side of the heat sink 
fins and reverse-mount it 
so it would pull air through 
the heat sink. It works, but 
I could have avoided some 
trouble if I’d measured first 
and selected a smaller model.

CHAPTER
 Keeping Your Laptop Cool  
 Laptops, unlike desktops, don’t offer internal options for better cooling or a lot of details in their 
system BIOSes to tell you how hot things are getting “under the hood.” To prevent your laptop from 
overheating, there are three methods you can use:  
•  Avoid blocked airflow
•  Adjust power settings
•  Use a cooling pad

 Before you buy a replacement heat sink, check the dimensions and installation instructions; they’re typically 
available at the manufacturer’s website.  

Keeping Devices Cool
418
 Avoiding Blocked Airflow  
 If you want to keep your laptop happy, keep it off your lap. This might sound strange, but loose 
clothing fabric can block airflow through your laptop and cause it to overheat. Similarly, avoid put-
ting your laptop on a bed or a tablecloth because loose fabric can block airflow.  
 The best place to put your laptop is on a hard surface, such as a table or counter.  
 Adjusting Power Settings  
 The second method is to use appropriate power settings. You can change power settings from the 
notification area in Windows or by going to the Control Panel. Click the power icon in the notifica-
tion area to get started ( Figure   16.14  ). 
 The default Balanced power setting ( Figure   16.15 ) is designed to slow down the processor when 
the system is idle to extend battery life. If you keep your system plugged in all the time, High 
Performance might be more your speed. However, if you’re trying to stretch battery life and keep 
the interior cool, use the Power Saver setting. Your system will run slower and the screen will be 
dimmer, but your battery will last longer per charge and the system will run a bit cooler.

 Tip 
 Do you run your laptop mainly on AC power? To keep your battery in top shape so it has the best possible 
run time when you do use it on battery power, remove it from your laptop when you don’t need it. Charge 
it when you need to run on battery power. If you leave it plugged in all the time, the battery tends to lose 
its ability to get a full charge, reducing run time.

CHAPTER
 Cooling Pads for Laptops  
 Although you can’t plug extra fans into your laptop, you can do the next best thing by buying a cool-
ing pad for your laptop. Put the cooling pad on a counter or table (or your lap), put the laptop on the 
cooling pad, and if you’ve selected a good unit, your laptop will stay cooler.  
 Although a few of these use passive cooling, most have one or more fans that are run from a spare 
USB port or with an AC adapter. Typically, two or more fans work better than one fan, and metal 
cooling pads are more durable than plastic ones.

at startup with and without the cooling pad.  Figure  16.16 shows a real-time display from Open 
Hardware Monitor when running on a laptop.  
 To determine how well the cooling pad works, download a copy of the latest edition of PCMark 
Basic Edition, a free benchmarking tool from Futuremark ( www.futuremark.com ). Use it to stress the 
system with and without the cooling pad. If the cooling pad is effective, you should see lower tem-

CHAPTER
 Preventing Desktop and Laptop 
Overheating with Preventative 
Maintenance  
 If you have dogs, cats, or other household pets that shed, your computer is going to have a harder 
time keeping cool if you don’t actively work to keep it clean. I have seen computers fatally overheat 
because their cooling vents and fans were completely clogged with pet hair. Even ordinary dust and 
dirt causes problems over time, such as fan slowdowns and failures.  
 How can you avoid problems?  
•  Keep your desktop computer off the floor—As you learned earlier in this chapter, desktop com-
puters use fans that pull air through the system to cool internal parts. If pet hair is blocking the
front and side vents or internal fans, overheating is inevitable.
•  Use a computer-grade vacuum cleaner to remove hair and dust from your computer. If you have
pets, check your systems every six months or so if the computer is on a table or desk. If it’s on
the floor, check it more often, especially during shedding season.
•  Use compressed air if you can’t use a vacuum cleaner to remove hair and dust. Try to blow the
hair and dust out of the computer, and put old newspapers or a drop cloth around the computer
to catch dislodged dust and hair.
•  Use the monitoring programs discussed earlier in this chapter to see warning signs of fan failure
or overheating.
•  Keep your computer away from windows which receive direct sunlight, especially if the windows
are not designed to reduce heat from direct sunlight.
•  If you hear screeching or tapping noises coming from inside your computer, check inside for
a failed fan or a loose wire blocking a fan. Use nylon cable ties to gather up excess wire, and
replace dying or dead fans immediately.
 Troubleshooting iOS and Android Device 
Overheating  
 Tablets and smartphones based on iOS and Android typically don’t have problems with overheating, 
but if you watch hours and hours of video content on them, you could have problems. To 
prevent these devices from overheating (and to get longer battery life per charge), follow these 
recommendations:  
•  Turn off features you’re not using. For example, if you don’t use a Bluetooth headset, turn off
Bluetooth ( Figure   16.17 ).

Keeping Devices Cool
422
•  If you can’t shut down your device while you charge it, be sure to close any apps you’re not
using.
•  Check for app and OS updates frequently, as some of these can help fix problems with overheat-
ing caused by app or OS buds.
•  If your device is overheating, take it out of its case.

do anything else.  
 Calibrating and Testing 
Touchscreens  
 If your touchscreen isn’t registering your touches or selects the 
wrong option, it might need to be recalibrated. Unfortunately, not 
all touchscreens can be calibrated by the user,, in which case you 
will need to contact the vendor.  
 Calibration in Windows 7/8/8.1  
 To recalibrate a touchscreen with Windows 7 and 8/8.1, follow these steps:  
1.  Open Search and type   Calibrate  .
2.  The Tablet PC Settings dialog appears ( see Figure   17.1 ). Click or tap  Calibrate .
3.  Tap the crosshair when it appears on each intersection on the grid ( see Figure   17.2 ).
 Caution 
 Never, never spray your 
device’s touchscreen with 
a liquid cleaner. You could 
damage your device. Instead, 
dampen a microfiber or lint-
free cloth. Whatever type of 
cleaning cloth you use, use a 
gentle circular motion and be 
sure to remove surface grit 
before you put pressure on 
your screen.

CHAPTER
 Calibration on iOS  
 IOS does not include a manual configuration utility, but you can 
sometimes correct calibration issues by rebooting your device. Shut 
it down, wait for a few moments, and restart it.  
 If the screen is still not responding properly to taps, you can use 
Reset or Restore to reset your iOS hardware. Keep in mind that you 
need to make backups before you try either of these options. We 
recommend contacting Apple support if you have calibration prob-
lems with your iOS device.

 Updating Your Operating System or 
Drivers  
 To keep your touchscreen and the rest of your device working 
properly, be sure to install updates for your operating system and 
hardware as they are offered by your device vendor.  
 With Windows 7/8/8.1, keep in mind that updates for hardware 
devices are typically optional, whereas other updates are auto-
matically selected.  
 Choosing and Using a Stylus  
 Especially with smartphones and small-format tablets, it’s easy to hit the wrong field or button on 
your device and wind up sending a misspelled message or a useless browser link. You might find 
that using a stylus would help you use your device with greater 
accuracy and more speed. A stylus also enables you to use your 
device when you are wearing gloves or mittens.  
 Before you purchase a stylus, see if your device already includes 
a stylus. If your device includes a stylus, you should use it, 
because it is especially designed to work with your device.  
 IOS, Android, and Windows devices with touchscreens use capac-
itive touchscreens, so they can use low-cost passive styluses 
available at many retailers.  
 Choose larger tips for use with tablets and smaller tips for use 
with smartphones. Check reviews for specific models to evaluate 
feel, line width, and durability. Note that low-cost styluses often 
have very soft tips that can wear out quickly.  
 A few manufacturers make active styluses that connect via 
Bluetooth. These are designed especially for use with 
graphics arts programs. See  www.wired.com/2013/11/
meet-pencil-the-best-ipad-stylus-yet-from-the-makers-of-paper/ . 
 Troubleshooting Wired Mice and 
Keyboards  
 There are four possible sources of trouble with wired keyboards, mice, and similar pointing devices:  
•  The port the device is plugged into
•  The device itself
•  The device driver
•  The device configuration in Control Panel
 Note 
 To learn more about driver 
updates, see “Using Windows 
Update,” p.364, in  Chapter 
 14 , “Keeping Your Devices 
Updated.” 
 Note 
 A capacitive touchscreen 
takes advantage of the 
human body’s ability to store 
a weak electrical charge to 
sense movement across the 
touchscreen’s surface.

Troubleshooting Wired Mice and Keyboards

CHAPTER
 If a USB port is not working, nothing plugged into the port is work-
ing. If an input device is not working, it will fail no matter what 
port you plug it into.  
 If the input device is not using the correct driver, you might not be 
able to use the device’s advanced features (most input devices can 
operate with basic functions by using Windows native keyboard 
and mouse drivers).  
 USB keyboards and pointing devices are referred to as  Human 
Interface Devices (HIDs) , and each HID-compliant device has at 
least two listings in Device Manager. One listing is for the device, 
and all other listings are for the HID functions of that device.  
 HID allows an input device to support additional buttons or fea-
tures, such as the multimedia or web browser control buttons com-
mon on most keyboards. If the keyboard has a scroll wheel, that 
feature will be listed separately as another HID-compliant mouse.  
 Troubleshooting Pointing Device Problems with 
Control Panel  
 If your mouse or other pointing device works, but you are not satisfied with its performance, com-
patibility, appearance, or movements, use the Mouse Properties sheet in the Windows Control Panel 
to adjust these settings.  Figure   17.5 shows the properties sheet tabs for a standard wheel mouse 
using standard Windows drivers. If you use a mouse with vendor-specific drivers or additional hard-
ware features, you might see additional options.  
 Tip 
 Although installing drivers 
for standard mice isn’t always 
necessary to use them, it’s 
vital when you use a gaming 
mouse. Most gaming mice 
include programmable but-
tons to make playing games 
easier, and some also include 
calibration features. Be sure 
to visit the mouse vendor’s 
website for the latest drivers 
for your gaming mouse.  
 A Fast Introduction to USB Terminology  
 No matter how much you know about other types of PC hardware, your first view of the Universal 
Serial Bus controller category in Device Manager is likely to be confusing. Here are some quick defi-
nitions of typical terms: 
 Universal Host Controller —Controls USB 1.1 ports.  
 Enhanced Host Controller —Provides USB 2.0 support. 
 USB 3.0 Host Controller —Provides USB 3.0 support. 
 Root hub —Each root hub corresponds to two (or sometimes more) USB ports. 
 Generic USB hub —A hub connected to a root hub. A generic hub can be a standalone unit or 
might be built in to a keyboard or monitor base. 
 Composite device —A USB device that has two or more interfaces in different categories. For 
example, a USB receiver for a wireless mouse and keyboard is a composite device.

 Troubleshooting Wireless Mice and 
Keyboards  
 Wireless mice and keyboards that have stopped working present a special troubleshooting chal-
lenge. The problem could be with any of the following:  
•  Their transceivers (which plug into the same connectors as normal input devices) can cause the
devices to fail.
•  The devices’ transmission and reception of signals from the transceivers can also cause device
failure.
•  Problems with battery life will cause temporary device failure when the batteries are exhausted.
 Most wireless input devices use radio signals, but a few devices use infrared (IR) signals instead.  
 Using Device Manager to Troubleshoot Wireless Mice 
and Keyboards  
 One major weakness of the Windows Device Manager is that it detects problems with the trans-
ceiver, not the device connected to the transceiver. For example, if the batteries in your wireless 
mouse or keyboard fail, the Device Manager will still report that the device works correctly. You can 
use the Device Manager to detect problems with how the transceiver is connected to your system.

CHAPTER
To troubleshoot wireless-specific problems, see the next section, “Troubleshooting Problems with 
Wireless Input Devices.”  
 Troubleshooting Problems with Wireless Input Devices 
 Even if the transceiver used by a wireless input device is working properly, the device itself might 
fail to work for one of the following reasons:  
•  An inability to exchange radio signals with the input device.
•  The transceiver is not configured to work with additional input devices.
•  A power failure occurred because of dead batteries or dirty/corroded battery terminals.
  Connecting to a Wireless Receiver  
 Most wireless input devices use the 2.4GHz range also used by 
most Wi-Fi networks. To connect your input device to its receiver, 
press the  Connect  button on the receiver and the input device. 
Some receivers don’t use a pushbutton and are automatically 
detected when you press the  Connect  button on the device.  
  Adding Support for Additional 
Input Devices  
 Logitech and HP now offer wireless input device receivers capable of working with multiple input 
devices: 
•  Logitech’s Unifying Receiver ( http://www.logitech.com/en-us/support/unifying ) supports up to
six devices.
•  HP’s Link-5 receiver ( www.hp.com , search for Link-5) supports up to five devices.
 The Logitech Unifying Receiver is paired with the device it was shipped with. To pair it with other 
devices, you must download the Logitech Unifying Software program from the Unifying Receiver 
website and run it ( see Figure   17.7 ). 
 To unpair a device, right-click it and click  Un-pair . 
 Tip 
 If you have a mouse and key-
board sold as a matched set, 
check the documentation or 
device labeling to see if you 
need to connect them in any 
particular order.  
 Note 
 Some low-cost Logitech input devices are shipped with a Nano receiver, which is the same size as the 
Unifying receiver, but supports only the device it was shipped with. Some of these devices can also be 
paired with a Unifying receiver. Look for the stylized asterisk symbol shown in  Figure   17.7 on the packaging 
or the device to determine which Logitech input devices are compatible with the Unifying Receiver.  

Troubleshooting Touchscreens, Keyboards, and Mice
434
 To connect other devices to the HP Link-5 receiver, move the device within one foot of the computer 
with the Link-5 receiver, press a button on the device, and press a button or key on the device to 
pair it with the receiver.  
  Can’t Pair Device with Receiver  
 If you can’t pair your device with a receiver, check the following:  
•  Mismatch of receiver and device— You can’t mix brands of receivers and input devices. You
must use a receiver made for the particular device or device family. For example, you can’t use a
Logitech Nano receiver with a Microsoft or HP input device.
•  Incorrect pairing method— Be sure to follow the directions for the device to pair it with the
receiver.
•  Device is out of range— Although some devices can work up to 20 feet away from the receiver,
you need to have the device next to the receiver for pairing. Move the device within one foot of
the receiver and try re-pairing the device and receiver.

CHAPTER
•  Pairing software not configured—  If you use Logitech Unifying Receiver-compatible devices, be
sure the device is listed as paired in the Advanced view shown in  Figure   17.7 . From this view,
you can also discontinue device pairing and retry pairing. If the device is not listed, follow the
directions to pair the device and receiver.
•  Device turned off— You can’t pair or use a wireless input device if it’s turned off. Wait a few sec-
onds for the device to respond before attempting to pair it or use it.
•  Battery failure— Weak or dead batteries prevent your device from pairing or working. If your
device uses removable batteries, replace your device’s batteries with fresh alkaline batteries
(most won’t work with rechargeable NiMH batteries because they produce lower voltage). If your
mouse uses rechargeable batteries, plug it into its charger. If the batteries have leaked, clean the
battery contacts on the unit and look for signs of corrosion. To see the battery status of a device
connected using Logitech Unifying software, open the software and click the device.
 Troubleshooting Bluetooth Mice and 
Keyboards  
 The Bluetooth radio built in to mobile devices and some laptops can be used for many devices, 
including headsets, printers, and input devices such as mice and keyboards. Before a Bluetooth 
device can work with your computer or mobile device, it must be paired with the device.

 Troubleshooting Problems with Bluetooth Devices  
 Some of the problems you can have with Bluetooth devices include the following:  
•  Device compatibility issues
•  Pairing issues
•  Range issues
•  Battery issues
•  Bluetooth disabled issues
 The following sections provide solutions to these problems.  
  Device Compatibility Issues  
 Some mobile devices don’t support as many types of Bluetooth devices as others. For example, both 
iOS and Android support Bluetooth keyboards, but iOS does not support Bluetooth mice, whereas 
Android does.

CHAPTER
 Some Bluetooth devices won’t work with certain operating systems. However, the compatibility list-
ing on a Bluetooth device might not be complete. So, if you have a Bluetooth device and you’re not 
sure it will work with your mobile device or computer, try it anyway.  
  Pairing Issues  
 If you are unable to pair a Bluetooth device with your mobile device or laptop, check the following:  
•  Make sure your computer or mobile device is set as discoverable. When you turn on Bluetooth
using Windows 8/8.1 from the Start screen or iOS, your device is automatically discoverable.
However, Android and Windows 7 (and Windows 8/8.1 from the Windows desktop) require you
to make the device discoverable after your turn on Bluetooth.
•  Make sure you press the Connect button on the Bluetooth device right away. When you enable
discovery on Android or Windows 7/8/8.1, you have a limited time to connect with your device.
•  If your device is not detected by the pairing utility, it might not be supported. The device might
also be too far out of range.
  Range Issues  
 Bluetooth devices have a much longer range after being paired than normal wireless mice and key-
boards. However, you could still be too far away from the host computer for the device to be paired 
or to work.  
 Try moving the Bluetooth device closer to your computer or mobile device and try re-pairing or 
connecting again. If you have 2.4GHz-band mobile phones or microwave ovens in use near your 
Bluetooth device, it might have problems with reliable operation.  
  Battery Issues  
 Your computer or mobile device’s battery will run down faster when Bluetooth is enabled. If your 
mobile device is very low on power, you might not be able to pair with a Bluetooth device or stay 
connected until you recharge your mobile device’s battery.  
 Your Bluetooth device will also stop working reliably when low on battery power, and it won’t work 
at all when the battery is completely run down. Use high-quality batteries (usually alkaline) in your 
Bluetooth devices, and be sure to remove them if you plan to store them for more than six months.  
  Bluetooth Disabled Issues  
 Even if Bluetooth is turned on, other changes you make to your computer or mobile device’s con-
figuration can turn off Bluetooth. Mobile devices with onboard Wi-Fi and Bluetooth typically have 
an Airplane mode option (also available in Windows 8/8.1). When this option is enabled, all onboard 
radios (including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) are disabled.  
 If you turn off wireless support with a function-key combination or a special push button on a 
Windows 7 laptop, you will turn off both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  

Troubleshooting Touchscreens, Keyboards, and Mice
444
 Troubleshooting IR Keyboards  
 Infrared (also known as IrDA) keyboards (sometimes including 
an integrated pointing device mouse equivalent) are available for 
use with PCs and some types of mobile devices.  
 IR-based input devices need a clear line-of-sight established 
between the transceiver and the input device. This is relatively 
simple to do with an input device placed on the desktop, but it 
can be a lot harder if you use a wireless keyboard or keyboard/
mouse combo on your lap.  
 The greater the distance between the IR receiver built in to or 
attached to your computer or mobile device and the keyboard, the 
more likely it is that an obstacle will block the IR signal.

 Signs of Drive Problems  
 Storage devices such as hard disk drives, SSDs (solid-state 
drives), flash memory, and optical media are used to store your 
favorite photos and music, important household and business 
documents, and your computer or device’s operating system.  
 When you experience one or more of the following problems, 
problems with your storage device should be at the top of your 
list of usual suspects:  
•  Files that formerly opened quickly take a long time to open.
•  “Disk read error” messages.
•  Grinding noises from your drive.
•  Windows requests permission to run a disk check.
•  A drive can’t be recognized by Windows or by a mobile device.
•  A file you opened can’t be played or viewed.
 In this chapter, you’ll learn how to help prevent problems with your media, how to recover “lost” 
information, and how to retrieve information from a backup. Whether you’re concerned about stor-
age on a Windows computer, a tablet, a media player, a smartphone, or an e-reader, this chapter can 
help. 
 Using SMART Drive Monitoring  
 Almost all PCs use Serial ATA (SATA) hard disks for mass storage, and some older models use 
Parallel ATA (PATA or ATA/IDE) hard disks. Both of these drive types support a detect-warning 
feature known as Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology, or SMART (also referred to 
as S.M.A.R.T.).  
 Note 
 An SSD is a drive based on 
fast flash memory. Unlike USB 
flash drives or flash memory 
cards, an SSD looks like a 
hard disk to your computer 
and performs much faster 
than a hard disk. However, an 
SSD is much more expensive 
per GB than a hard disk.  

447
Using SMART Drive Monitoring
18
CHAPTER
 Most computers are designed to monitor the condition of SMART-
compatible hard disks so you can be warned of impending failures. 
However, in practice, warnings generated by the system BIOS 
about SMART failures often occur just before complete disk drive 
failure, leaving no time for backups.  
 How can you make sure that SMART monitoring is working to 
keep you alerted of hard disk problems? First, if your system BIOS 
has an option to enable SMART capability, enable it unless you use 
a SMART monitoring program that can’t coexist with SMART monitoring. In  Figure   18.1 , we see an 
advanced BIOS dialog in which SMART monitoring is disabled.  
 Second, use hard disk testing software from your drive vendor to help determine if a drive is in dan-
ger of failing. For details, see “Using Drive Vendors’ Disk Testing Software,” p.454, this chapter.  
 If you cannot determine if your hard disk drive is supported by a vendor-supplied hard disk test-
ing program, download and run a disk-testing program that works with virtually all drives, such 
as PassMark’s DiskCheckup ( see Figure   18.2 ). DiskCheckup is free for personal use and is avail-
able from  www.passmark.com/products/diskcheckup.htm . It displays SMART attributes, rates your 
drive’s condition, and can be used with internal and external hard disks.  
 Note 
 SMART is also supported by 
most external hard disk drives 
connected to USB or FireWire 
ports.

 When Should You Check SMART Attributes?  
 Under normal operating conditions, you should test your hard disks every month using a program 
such as CHKDSK (included in Windows) or a vendor-supplied hard disk utility and review their 
SMART attributes for errors. On a portable or laptop hard disk, I recommend checking twice a 
month, because these drives are in greater danger of being physically damaged or overheating.  
 If a drive displays even a single SMART problem area (in other words, a SMART attribute is listed 
as FAIL or a failure date is listed), it’s time to back it up and replace it before it fails and takes your 
information with it.

Checking Your Windows Drives for Errors

CHAPTER
 Checking Your Windows Drives for Errors  
 Although Microsoft Windows 7 and 8/8.1 have automated disk defragmentation to help improve 
performance, you need to test your drives for errors periodically. Use the Windows Error-Checking 
program (CHKDSK.EXE) to make sure your drive’s file structure is working properly. Here’s how to 
use to check your system (C:) drive:  
1.  Open Windows Explorer (Windows 7) or File Explorer (Windows 8/8.1).
2.  Right-click C: drive and select  Properties .
3.  Click the  Tools  tab.
4.  Click  Check (Windows 8/8.1) or Check Now  (Windows 7).
5.  Click  Start .
6.  Click  Schedule Disk Check  (see  Figure   18.3 ). Windows will run CHKDSK.EXE the next time you
start your computer and display the results when Windows starts.

 You can check drives other than the Windows system drive without restarting your computer. The 
process is the same, except that the disk test starts after step 5.  
 During the test, Windows checks a variety of disk structures and looks for errors. If any errors are 
found, they are displayed at the end of the test ( see Figure   18.4 ). 
 When Should You Check Drives for Errors?  
 Under normal operating conditions, you should check your hard disks about once a month, or when-
ever Windows recommends it for a particular drive. On a portable or laptop hard disk, I recommend 
checking twice monthly, because these drives are in greater danger of being physically damaged or 
overheating. 
 If a drive has file system errors every time you test it, consider backing it up and replacing it.

CHAPTER
 Checking USB and Flash Memory Devices 
for Errors  
 You can use the same Check/Check Now procedure discussed in the previous section for USB, flash 
memory, and other external flash and hard disk drives. Windows 8 and 8.1 automatically check 
external drives for errors when you connect them to your system and will alert you from either the 
Windows Desktop or the Start menu if testing is recommended (see  Figure   18.5 ). 
 You can skip testing or checking the drive, and after the repair process is over determine if any 
drive problems existed ( see Figure   18.6 ).

 When Should You Check USB and Flash Memory Drives 
for Errors?  
 Under normal operating conditions, you should check these drives about once a month, or when-
ever Windows recommends it for a particular drive. If you don’t eject the drive before removing it 
by using the Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media tool in the notification area of the Windows 
desktop, you should test the drive the next time you insert it.  
 If a drive has file system errors every time you test it, consider backing it up and replacing it.  
 Using Format to Solve Disk Errors  
 The Format command in Windows is typically run in Quick mode. Quick mode, which takes just a 
few seconds, erases the drive’s root folder (which is where the information about the files on the 
drive is stored) so the remainder of the space on the drive can be reused. Quick formatting does  not 
re-create the drive’s logical layout, so a drive that has developed file system errors might still have 
these errors, even after formatting.  
 Before replacing a drive, format the drive again without using the Quick option. If you don’t use 
the Quick option, the entire logical layout of the drive is re-created, which can help the drive store 
information more reliably. Keep in mind that you need to back up the contents of a drive before you 
perform either type of format. Here’s how to use this method:  
Click or tap to scan drive and fix any errors detected

1.  Copy any files you want to keep from the drive you are going to format to a different drive, using
drag and drop, copy and paste, or Copy To.
2.  Right-click the drive in Windows Explorer or File Explorer and select  Format  ( see Figure   18.7 ).
3.  Clear the  Quick Format  check box (it’s selected by default).
4.  Click  OK ( see Figure   18.8 ). Prepare to wait a while, especially if you’re formatting a hard disk
drive. A green progress bar keeps you informed.
5.  At the end of the process, close the Format dialog.
 Run Error-checking on the drive after you complete the format process, and do so periodically to 
determine if the drive is more reliable than before. If the drive continues to have problems, 
replace it.

 Using Drive Vendors’ Disk-Testing 
Software  
 Most hard disk drive vendors supply testing software that can be used to check a drive’s SMART 
attributes and to check the condition of the storage media. Unlike third-party diagnostic programs, 
some of these programs can also perform data-destructive testing or drive-zeroing operations. 
These programs might be included on a disc supplied with the drive, or they can be downloaded 
from the drive vendors’ websites. See  Table   18.2   for a list of the most common tools from major 
drive vendors.

Using Drive Vendors’ Disk-Testing Software
18
CHAPTER
 Some of these tools can be used for testing both internal and external drives. Be sure to check the 
recommendations for testing software for your particular hard disk model.  
 In  Figure   18.9 , Seagate’s SeaTools is being used to perform a quick test on an internal hard disk.  
 In  Figure   18.10 , Western Digital’s Data LifeGuard Diagnostics is displaying test results for an 
installed hard disk.  
 Tip 
 To make sure you download a program that is compatible with your hard disk, you need to determine the 
brand name and model number of your drive.  
 You can determine the model number of an internal hard disk by opening Device Manager, expanding the 
Disk Drives section, and looking for drives listed as SATA or PATA drives. The drive model number is usually 
displayed. Search the model number online to determine the manufacturer of your drive.

 When Should You Use Drive Vendors’ Test Programs?  
 Drive vendors’ test programs should be run every three to six months for both desktop and portable 
drives under normal conditions, as well as immediately after a serious system problem, such as a 
dropped computer or drive, a shutdown caused by a power surge, or if the drive displays errors after 
you run CHKDSK.  
 Some vendors require that you use their test program to determine if a drive is defective before it 
can be returned for replacement. So, if you suspect a drive under warranty is defective, you should 
run the appropriate test program to check its condition.  
 Recovering “Lost” Data  
 Did you delete a file by mistake? Did you clear off a flash memory card before you copied its con-
tents to your computer or to an optical disc? What if you resized a photo and saved the small version 
over the full-sized version? Did you format a drive and then discover it contained vital tax records?  
 There are a variety of ways to deal with data loss, but before you do anything else, do this:  
1.  Take a deep breath and let it out slowly.
2.  Don’t panic.

Recovering “Lost” Data
18
CHAPTER
 There are several ways to recover from a data loss. These include the following:  
•  Restoring items from the Recycle Bin
•  Restoring a previous version
•  Retrieving a backup copy of the file(s)
•  Running data-recovery software to retrieve a file that was not in the Recycle Bin
 Restoring Files from the Recycle Bin 
 When you highlight a file or folder on a hard disk drive or SSD in Windows Explorer or File Explorer 
and press the Delete (Del) key, or, as in  Figure   18.11 , you select Delete from the right-click menu) 
and click Yes ( see Figure   18.12 ), your file or folder and contents are moved from their original loca-
tion to a special folder called the Recycle Bin.  
 Tip 
 If you “lost” files while working in Windows Explorer or File Explorer, the real problem might be that you 
accidentally dragged a file or folder into another folder. If you think this happened, immediately press 
Ctrl+Z on your keyboard to undo the move. If you are using a tablet, you can bring up the onscreen key-
board and then click Ctrl+Z on the onscreen keyboard or enable the menu and select Edit, Undo Move.

See  Figure   18.14 .
 The items are restored to their original location.  
 Note 
 To see how much space the Recycle Bin uses on each drive, right-click the Recycle Bin, select Properties, and 
select a drive. You can adjust the size reserved for Recycle Bin for each drive, disable the Recycle Bin so that 
files are removed immediately, and disable the default delete confirmation dialog shown in  Figure   18.12 .

you empty the Recycle Bin that you need the file, you will need to use data recovery software to retrieve 
your file.

 Restoring a Previous Version  
 If you accidentally save a changed version of a file using Save rather than Save As, only to realize 
that you preferred the previous version, you’ll appreciate the ability to restore a previous version of 
a file. However, don’t assume that your computer is ready to provide you with this safety net. Here’s 
what you need:  
•  In Windows 7, you need to enable System Protection for any hard disk other than C: drive (it’s
enabled on C: drive by default) or use Windows Backup.
•  In Windows 8/8.1, you need to set up and use File Protection.
 If your system is already configured to support previous versions, you can right-click a file, select 
Properties, and a Previous Versions tab is available.  
  Restoring a Previous Version in Windows 7  
 Here’s how to retrieve a previous version of a file using Windows 7. In this example, we converted 
a color photo to black and white and cropped it, and then realized we want to revert to the original 
version. 
1.  Right-click the file in Windows Explorer and select  Properties  ( see Figure   18.15 ).
2.  Click the Previous Versions tab.
3.  Select a previous version and click  Restore .
4.  Click  Restore on the confirmation dialog ( see Figure   18.16 ).
 Note 
 To learn how to set up these options, see, “Preparing a Windows-Based Computer or Tablet for Easier 
Troubleshooting,” p.37, in  Chapter   1 , “PC, Tablet, Mobile Device, Home Theater, Digital Camera, and

 Caution 
 If you want to keep both the current version of a file and a previous version, make a copy of the current 
version  before  you start this process.

 Using a Data-Recovery Program  
 As you can see, Windows 7 and 8/8.1 provide a variety of ways to help you recover “lost” data. It’s 
easy as long as there’s a copy of the files you need in the Recycle Bin, a restore point (Windows 7), 
File History (Windows 8/8.1), or a backup (Windows 7). But what do you do if the one and only copy 
of an important file was deleted with Shift+Delete (which bypasses the Recycle Bin) and it’s too 
new to be backed up? Or you’ve accidentally formatted the SD card containing your vacation photos 
before you copied them to your computer?  In situations like this, you need data-recovery software. 
 Data recovery software is designed to read the disk surface to locate files, bypassing the root folder 
or other locations on the disk that keep a record of where files are stored. Thus, data recovery 
software can find files even when the drive has been formatted, either using Quick or full format 
options. Some data recovery programs specialize in recovering files from flash memory cards used 
by cameras; these include the option to preview images so you can select the ones you want.

Recovering “Lost” Data
18
CHAPTER
 Data recovery software should be installed before you delete files from your system. The capability 
of a data recovery program to locate and restore your files depends on the file space not being over-
written by new programs or other files. To avoid data loss, data recovery programs typically copy 
retrieved files to a different drive, and some run directly from the program disc rather than requiring 
installation. 
 You can find numerous data-recovery programs on the market. Because each data-recovery situation 
can be different, most vendors offer free versions that can scan for 
lost data and display the files found. You can then license the pro-
gram and use it to complete the recovery task.  
 Some data-recovery programs work with hard disk, flash memory, 
or SSDs only, whereas others can retrieve data from optical drives 
as well. Be sure to review the supported drive types, the Windows 
versions supported, and other information, and try a demo version 
if available before you buy.  
  Retrieving Deleted Files That Bypassed the Recovery 
Bin 
 As you saw in  Figure   18.12 , files that are “deleted” are actually sent to the Recycle Bin, where 
they are kept until the bin runs out of space or until you empty the Recycle Bin to free up space on 
the drive. However, if you hold down the Shift key when you press the Del key, the files or folders 
selected for deletion bypass the Recycle Bin and can be overwritten when the space they occupy is 
needed. 
 In this example, I used Iolo Technologies Search and Recover program ( www.iolo.com/products/
search-and-recover/ ). It can be launched directly from the CD to avoid overwriting deleted data you 
want to recover.  
 To retrieve deleted files, use the option to scan your drive for erased files. In  Figure   18.27 , the 
Search and Recover File Rescue Wizard has located all the erased files on the C: drive. Because 
we’re looking for photos, we select Pictures and Photos to narrow the results.  
 You can select all files or click the check box next to each file to select it. After selecting files, select 
the option to recover all or selected files.  
 In  Figure   18.28 , a new folder on a different drive is being created. This folder will be used as the 
destination for recovered files.  
 As each file is recovered, it is copied to the destination folder. At the end of the recovery process, 
you can view the recovered files. You can copy or move the recovered files to other locations.

discussed in this chapter, I

  Retrieving Photos from a Formatted Memory Card  
 Flash memory cards can hold hundreds or thousands of photos, so using a program that can preview 
recovered files is helpful. In this example, we used MediaRecover ( http://freshcrop.com/ ) to retrieve 
files from a formatted memory card.  
 Make sure you use the correct data recovery option when scanning for lost files. MediaRecover’s 
Scan option located no images because it’s designed to find erased (deleted) files. However, the 
Advanced Scan, which scans the disk surface, located several folders, many picture files, and pro-
vides a preview ( see Figure   18.29 ). 
 After the files are retrieved to a different folder, open that folder. Select a viewing option that uses 
medium or larger thumbnails. Images with viewable thumbnails have been recovered successfully. 
Images displayed with icons were partially or fully overwritten and could not be recovered ( see 
Figure   18.30 ).

 Recovering Files from Optical Discs  
 Although CD, DVD, and BD (Blu-ray) drives are assigned drive letters by Windows, the way they 
store data is much different than data stored on a hard disk or flash memory drive. Hard disks can 
store a file in either a single chunk or in smaller sections as space permits. Flash memory drives 
store a file in as many blocks as necessary. However, optical drives write information in a spiral that 
begins in the data area near the hub, with momentary gaps for audio tracks or for data sessions. If 
the spiral track is disturbed by surface scratches, cracks, or  damage to the reflective coating below 
the label side, some or all of the data may be inaccessible.  
 To complicate matters, media can be written in a mastered format, in which all the files in a session 
are written at once, or one file at a time (drag and drop using universal disc format, or UDF). For 
these reasons, it can be much more difficult and take much longer to recover data from a damaged 
optical disc.  
 Cleaning and Polishing the Disc’s Data Surface  
 If you are unable to read the contents of an optical disc, take a careful look at the data side (the 
shiny side). Marks and scratches can interfere with the laser used to read the information.  
 You can use polishing and cleaning materials made especially for optical discs to help remove marks 
and surface scratches.  Figure   18.31  shows the data surface of a marked and scratched CD-R before

 Using Optical Disc Recovery Software  
 There are many data recovery programs designed to work with 
optical media, and some also support data recovery from hard 
disk and flash memory. Use a trial version to determine which 
files can be recovered successfully before purchasing the full ver-
sion of the program.  
 In this example, I used the free version of ISOBuster 
( www.isobuster.com ) to attempt to recover photos from a CD-R. 
Part of the CD-R’s contents could be read by Windows, but start-
ing with a picture called Dark_Photo.jpg, Windows was unable to 
open the rest of the disc. I used ISOBuster to recover Dark_Photo.
jpg as well as Dust.jpg, which was located after Dark_Photo.jpg on the disc.  
 After I selected Dust.jpg for extraction, ISOBuster began to read the file from the CD-R. Because 
of the condition of the CD-R, this took several minutes and several disc errors were detected ( see 
Figure   18.33 ). 
 After trying Retry from the options available in  Figure   18.33 without success, I selected Ignore and 
eventually clicked the Ignore All option. After ISOBuster read the sectors it could read, it created a 
version of the file in a folder I had created on my hard disk for recovered images.  
 Caution 
 Be careful when using optical media. The closer the marks and scratches are to the center of the disc, the 
more difficult it can be to retrieve information from the disc. Even after cleaning, the information on the 
disc shown in  Figures   18.31  and   18.32  could not be retrieved.  
 Tip 
 If you are having problems 
reading a disc, try the disc in 
a different drive. You may 
also have better results recov-
ering data from a disc by 
using different drives.

 In  Figure   18.34 , you can see the results of this and several other optical disc data recovery attempts. 
Although Dust.jpg and Dark_Photo.jpg were recovered successfully, files on a different disc that 
were partly overwritten by mistake could not be recovered.  
 Freeing Up Storage Space on Your 
Windows Computer or Tablet  
 Windows tablets and Ultrabooks rely on limited capacity SSDs (often with capacities as little as 
32GB–64GB) instead of hard disk drives for mass storage. However, whether you use a tablet, a 
laptop, or a desktop hard disk, you might run short of space over time. Windows includes three 
features that can help you free up storage space: Disk Cleanup, Libraries, and OneDrive (formerly 
called SkyDrive).

 Using Disk Cleanup  
 Disk Cleanup is available from the drive properties sheet in Window 7 and 8/8.1, as well as older 
releases of Windows. Disk Cleanup enables you to remove files of limited usefulness from your sys-
tem and can sometimes free up multiple gigabytes of disk space. 
 To run Disk Cleanup, follow these steps:  
1.  Open Windows Explorer or File Explorer.
2.  Right-click or press and hold your system (C:) drive icon and select  Properties .
3.  From the  General  tab, click  Disk Cleanup .
4.  Windows displays the file categories that can be removed and the amount of space they use. To
select a category for deletion, click an empty check box. To skip a category, clear the check box.
5.  Click  OK to continue.
6.  Click  Delete Files  ( see Figure   18.35 ).

 If you need to recover much more space, click the  Clean Up System 
Files button shown in  Figure   18.35 . You can remove Windows 
Update and upgrade files and other large files you don’t need. 
Depending on your system’s specifics, you might be able to recover 
10GB–15GB of space.  
 Using Windows Libraries  
 Windows 7 introduced the concept of libraries, which enables mul-
tiple locations with the same content to be viewed as a single logi-
cal folder. Rather than clicking your way from folder to folder to see 
your photos, music, documents, and videos, you can see them all in 
one place. It’s a great feature if you’ve run out of space on your C: 
drive and are using external drives for the overflow.  
 Windows 8/8.1 have libraries turned off by default. To turn on 
libraries: 
1.  Open File Explorer.
2.  Click or tap the  View tab.
3.  Open the  Navigation Pane  menu.
4.  Click or tap  Show Libraries .
5.  To see libraries, scroll down in the left pane to Libraries.
 In Windows 7, and in Windows 8/8.1 after you enable Libraries, clicking the Documents library icon 
displays the contents of the Documents and Public Documents folders. Click Pictures to see the 
contents of Pictures and Public Pictures, and so on. In Windows 8/8.1, the Documents library also 
includes the contents of the user’s OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) folder.  
 You can move file types that consume a lot of disk space, such as digital photos, music files, and 
videos from your system hard disk (C:) to an external hard disk and still use them as easily as you 
could when they were stored on your system drive. For example, here’s how to use the Libraries 
feature to free up space occupied by your digital photo collection.  
 With Windows 7:  
1.  Connect an external hard disk to your computer.
2.  Open Windows Explorer.
3.  Click the external hard disk icon.
4.  Use the  New Folder  button to create a folder called My Pix on that drive.
5.  Open the Pictures library.
6.  Select any or all of the folders in the Pictures folder.
7.  Drag them to the My Pix folder on the external drive and drop them.
 Caution 
 The More Options tab offers 
two more ways to recover 
space: removing programs 
you don’t use and removing 
older system restore points. 
If you remove older system 
restore points, you will also 
lose older versions of files 
you have edited. As long as 
at least 15% of your C: drive 
is available, your system can 
run properly.

 Using Cloud Storage  
 OneDrive ( onedrive.live.com ), Dropbox ( www.dropbox.com ), Google Drive ( https://drive.google.
com/ ), and Apple iCloud ( www.apple.com/icloud/ ) are popular cloud storage services that sup-
port Windows-based computers. All have web-based services along with a downloadable client. 
OneDrive, Dropbox, and Google Drive can also be used with MacOS, Android, or iOS devices 
(Dropbox also works with Linux and BlackBerry), while iCloud can also be used with MacOS and iOS 
devices. 
 All vendors offer various amounts of free storage space, with varying price levels for additional 
space. iCloud does not count Camera Roll storage against its storage limit, while OneDrive offers 
5GB additional storage free of charge to iOS users.  
 To learn more about iCloud, see “Freeing Up Storage Space on Your iOS Device,” p.489, this chapter.

 By using OneDrive, users can  
•  Supplement limited device storage space with cloud storage.
•  Make information available to multiple devices remotely.
•  Synchronize information across multiple devices.
 The OneDrive app is built into Windows 8.1. To download it for 
other supported devices, go to  https://onedrive.live.com/ . You 
will need a free Microsoft account to use OneDrive. If you don’t 
have a Microsoft account already, you can sign up for one at the 
OneDrive website.  
  Using OneDrive on Windows Vista or Windows 7  
 After OneDrive is installed, it shows up as a folder in Windows 
Explorer’s Favorite’s section. Folders and files that have been 
synced are indicated with a green checkmark. When you copy, 
move, or paste files and folders into OneDrive, curved blue 
arrows indicate the files are awaiting synchronization (see  
Figure   18.40 ). When the blue arrows are replaced with a green 
checkmark, the files are stored on OneDrive and can be accessed 
by your other devices.  
 Note 
 Cloud storage uses remote 
servers accessed via the 
Internet to store informa-
tion. Cloud storage can be 
accessed via web browsers or 
via programs or apps installed 
on desktop, laptop, or mobile 
devices.

 When you use the OneDrive app, you are synchronizing files on your computer and OneDrive 
cloud storage. In other words, as you update, replace, or delete a file or folder in the OneDrive 
folder on your PC, the same changes are made to the OneDrive cloud storage version. You can 
access OneDrive via an app or web browser from another system to view and change these files, 
and OneDrive will make the same changes to the contents of the OneDrive folder on each device. 
However, note that the Windows 7 OneDrive app only displays files and folders you uploaded using  
the app.  
 If you want to use OneDrive to store files so they don’t use space on your Windows 7 system, use 
one of the following methods:  
•  Log into the OneDrive website and copy files to it. After the files are copied to OneDrive online,
you can delete them from your system, but they will still be available via your web browser.
•  Download the SDExplorer program from  www.cloudstorageexplorer.com/products.php . It enables
access to OneDrive cloud storage from Windows Explorer, so you can copy files to and from
OneDrive more easily.
 To free up space on your device by using OneDrive with Windows 7:  
1.  Open your web browser.
2.  Go to the OneDrive website ( https://onedrive.live.com ).
3.  Log in if prompted.
4.  Click the  Upload  button.
5.  Select the files to upload and they are uploaded to OneDrive ( see Figure   18.41 ).
6.  After the files are uploaded to OneDrive, delete them from your system. Use  Shift-Delete  to
bypass the Recycle Bin, and the files will no longer use space on your device.
7.  When you need access to the files, open the OneDrive website.
 Note 
 Microsoft Office files can be opened with Office 2010 and later versions without being downloaded first. To 
work with other file types, download them to your system.

  Using OneDrive with Windows 8.1  
 Windows 8.1 includes an enhanced OneDrive app available from both the Start screen and File 
Explorer. Unlike the Windows 7 version, the Windows 8.1 version lists all files stored on OneDrive, 
whether they were uploaded with an app or via a web browser. By default, files stored on OneDrive 
are set as offline, meaning that they are also stored on your computer.  
 To save space on your computer using OneDrive for Windows 8.1, you need to upload files to 
OneDrive and make them online-only:  
1.  Move files you want to remove from your system to the OneDrive folder on your computer.
 Follow these steps from the Start screen:
2.  Click or tap  OneDrive .
3.  Navigate to the file or folder you want to remove from your system.

 Troubleshooting Cloud Storage  
 If you are having problems with cloud storage, check the following: 
•  Incorrect login— With most providers, you have the option to store your login for easier connec-
tion. Unless your computer is shared with other users who can access your account, storing your
login helps avoid login problems.
•  Can’t access files— Files that are stored only on the service can only be accessed if you have
Internet access. If you are going to an area with spotty or non-existent Internet access, down-
load your files to your device or to a wireless device you can access via a peer-to-peer Wi-Fi
connection. See “File Sharing with Portable Devices,” p.261, in  Chapter   9 , “Solving File Sharing
Problems,” for details.
•  Can’t access the service— Make sure you have a working Internet connection and the correct
login credentials for the service.

 Cloning Your Hard Disk  
 If you find that you are short of disk space on a Windows desktop or laptop computer, you can clone 
your hard disk’s contents to a larger drive and use it to replace the drive built in to your computer. 
You can then use the drive you replaced as an additional internal hard disk (if you have an available 
drive bay) or convert it into an external hard disk with a drive enclosure.  
 If you are short of hard disk space, we recommend that you do the following:  
•  Choose a hard disk that has at least twice the storage space of your current hard disk. For exam-
ple, if you are replacing a 320GB hard disk, select a 750GB or larger drive. If you are replacing a
1TB hard disk, select a 2TB or larger drive.
•  Make sure the drive you want to use as a replacement uses the same connection type as your
existing hard disk. Refer to “Points of Failure Inside the Computer,” p.23,  Chapter   1 , “PC, Tablet,
Mobile Device, Home Theater, Digital Camera and Camcorder Anatomy 101” for details.
•  If you are replacing a laptop hard disk drive, keep in mind that some laptops require hard disks
that are no more than 7mm thick. Many laptop hard disks are thicker and will not fit it into a nar-
rower space.
 To clone your laptop or desktop computer’s existing hard disk to a 
new hard disk, you can:  
•  Connect your new drive via a drive enclosure that connects to a
USB 2.0, eSATA (faster), or USB 3.0 (fastest) port.
•  Connect your new drive via a drive dock.
•  Connect your new drive to an SATA port inside your computer.
 After you connect your drive, you can use software provided by 
your drive vendor or use commercially available cloning software. 
In this example, we’ll use a version of Acronis True Image.  
1.  Connect your new hard disk.
2.  Download and install the latest version of your drive vendor’s
cloning software.
3.  Start the program and select the  Clone Disk  option.
 Note 
 Seagate distributes a ver-
sion of Acronis True Image 
as DiscWizard for use with 
its drives (including Samsung 
and Maxtor drives). Western 
Digital distributes a version 
of True Image as Acronis True 
Image for WD Edition. The 
process is similar with the 
commercial version of Acronis 
True Image.  
 To use the Seagate or WD 
versions of True Image, you 
must have at least one drive 
of an eligible brand installed 
in your computer.

4.  Unless you want to use your new hard disk for more than one operating system, select
 Automatic and continue.
5.  With automatic cloning, the partitions on the original hard disk are duplicated on the new drive.
If the new drive is larger than the original drive, the partition sizes are adjusted accordingly. In
this example, a 1TB hard disk set up as a single partition (C: drive) that is almost full is being
cloned to a 2TB drive. Thus, over half of the new drive will be available for new programs or
information. Click  Proceed  to continue.
6.  Restart your computer when requested (this is necessary to enable the operating system to be
copied properly).
 After the cloning process ( see Figure   18.45 ) is complete, the computer shuts down.  
 Remove the old hard disk from your computer. Install the new hard disk in its place. When you 
restart your computer, you can use your computer the same way as before, but with more hard disk 
space.

 Checking Android Devices for Storage 
Errors  
 Android devices, unlike iOS devices, use Linux-based file systems that can be viewed by Windows. 
However, if you want to scan your Android device for errors, you must do the following: 
1.  Root the device. Rooting enables you to function as a superuser who can perform maintenance
tasks, such as disk checking, that are not possible for a normal user. Numerous rooting apps are
available from Google Play.
2.  Install a maintenance utility that is designed for root usage. These apps are available from
Google Play and are identified as requiring root access.
 However, if you have problems with a microSD card, you can scan it when you receive a notification 
as a normal user.

 Both jailbreaking and rooting give users unrestricted access to a mobile device, but the terms are not inter-
changeable.  
 Jailbreaking (or iOS jailbreaking) refers to unauthorized changes to the iOS operating system used on Apple 
mobile devices. Jailbroken devices often need to be started from a computer for the jailbreak changes to 
work, and updates to iOS undo or temporarily prevent jailbreaks.  
 Android rooting, on the other hand, is not prohibited by Google, and is necessary for some Android apps 
used for system maintenance, backup, and other tasks.

 Freeing Up Storage Space on Your 
Android Device  
 Android smartphones and tablets have very limited storage space compared to PCs or Windows 
tablets. If you run out of space in your device, you won’t be able to shoot photos or video, download 
music, or create or edit contacts. However, unlike iOS devices, most Android devices have microSD 
slots so you can expand your device’s available storage.  
 To determine how much space is being used by apps and data, open  Settings , tap  More , and tap 
 Storage ( see Figure   18.54 ). To see more information, tap a category, then a subcategory.  
 On the author’s smartphone, about half the 16GB of internal storage is currently in use, but an

 Solving Software Licensing Issues  
 Software piracy is a major problem today, and one of the most common ways to deal with it is to 
enforce software licensing with activation technology. With Microsoft Windows and many Windows 
programs or apps today, you will lose some or all features if your operating system or app is not 
properly licensed and activated. To avoid problems, follow these guidelines:  
•  Unless you have a program or app that can be licensed for mul-
tiple computers, you can use it on only one computer at a time.
•  Some apps can be moved to a different computer, but only if you
de-activate or unauthorize the computer where the app is cur-
rently installed.
•  If you don’t have a software license for an app, some might be
installed in a limited feature or demo mode.
•  If you purchase a license for an operating system or an app that
was already installed, you might be able to add that information
to the app or OS without needing to reinstall it.
 Let’s take a closer look at how to use these solutions.  
 Deactivating an App  
 To deactivate or unauthorize an app means that you are removing the license for using the software 
from a particular computer. Some programs from Adobe, Acronis, and other vendors include this fea-
ture. Here are some examples of when to deactivate an app:  
•  If you need to install a single-user program on more than one computer, but you can use only one
installation at a time (for example, a desktop and a laptop computer).
•  If you need to test an app that doesn’t include a trial version on a different computer.
 In these cases, you would do the following:  
1.  Install the app on the first computer.
2.  After using the app, deactivate it.
3.  Install the app on the second computer.
4.  After using the app, deactivate it.
5.  Reactivate the app on the first computer.
6.  Repeat the cycle as needed.
 The process of deactivating and reactivating an app varies from app to app and version to version. 
Keep in mind that many apps don’t support this feature. Basically, if you install an operating system 
or an app that requires you to enter a license number before you can use it or to gain full access to 
 Tip 
 Before you retire, recycle, or 
scrap a computer that con-

create a list of license num-
bers or product keys. The

this information as part of its

its features, don’t uninstall it until you find out from the vendor whether and how to deactivate or 
reactivate it.  
 Installing Software in Trial Mode  
 If you need temporary access to a particular program, you might be able to install it in Trial mode. 
With data-recovery programs, Trial mode usually limits you to viewing files that can be recov-
ered. However, most other types of programs don’t limit available features during the trial period 
(typically 30 days). Trial versions are often offered separately from the licensed version, but some 
licensed apps prompt you for a license number and will install in a time-limited trial version if you 
don’t provide a license number (see  Figure   19.1 ). 
 With most Windows software vendors offering trial versions today, we don’t recommend buying a 
Windows program or app unless you can try it first. However, with the much lower prices set for 
Android and iOS apps, you might need to buy an app without having the opportunity to use a trial 
 Note 
 Some apps with this feature can automatically deactivate other installations for you when you install the 
app on a computer that would otherwise exceed the number of allowable installations.

version first. In those cases, look for a separate Lite or Free version that can be upgraded with in-
app purchases.  
 Problems with Activating Microsoft Programs  
 Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office apps must be activated within a specified time (up to 30 
days) or some of their features will stop working. Normally, activation is performed through an 
Internet connection using the Product Activation Wizard. If you did not activate the software the 
first time you used it, you can access the activation wizard later.  
 To determine if Windows is activated, open the System properties sheet. In Windows 7, follow these 
steps: 
1.  Open the Start menu.
2.  Right-click  Computer .
3.  Select  Properties .
4.  Scroll to the bottom of the System properties window to see the activation status (see
Figure   19.2 ).

4.  Scroll to the bottom of the System properties window to see the activation status (see
Figure   19.3 ).
 To view the activation status for Microsoft Office 2010 and earlier versions, open the File menu and 
select  Help (see  Figure   19.4  ). For Microsoft Office 2013 or Office 365, open the File menu and select 
 Accounts. 
 If you cannot activate via the wizard, or activation via the wizard fails, you can activate your 
Microsoft software through the Microsoft Product Activation Center.

 If you have problems activating your software through the 
Product Activation Center’s automated system, ask to speak to 
a service representative. The representative will ask you some 
questions to determine the status of your product. Be accurate 
about whether the software was previously installed on a com-
puter (the most common reason for a problem) and if the software 
is still installed on another PC. If you have removed the software 
from the other PC, or if it is no longer in use (for example, if it has 
been scrapped or recycled), you should be able to activate the 
software using  the instructions provided by the service represen-
tative.

 Adding or Changing a Product Key or License Number  
 If you discover that you are using a program that cannot be licensed with the product key or license 
number you have, you will need to purchase a license for the program. In most cases, you don’t 
need to reinstall the program. Instead, you can change the current product key license number.  
 In Microsoft Windows, open the System properties sheet (refer to  Figures   19.2 and   19.3 ) and click 
the Change Product Key link.  Figure   19.5 shows the Change Product Key dialog for Windows 7. 
 Figure   19.6  shows the Change Product Key dialog for Windows 8/8.1.  
 Tip 
 If you need multiple copies of Microsoft Office, buying traditional boxed editions is much more expensive 
than using Office 365. Office 365 is available in versions for home, small business, and large corporation/
enterprise settings. After you license it, you install it via the Internet and it works like Office 2013. To learn 
more about Office 365, visit  http://office.microsoft.com/ .

 If you need to change the product key for a program you originally installed as a trial version, you 
can typically add the product key when you start the program, as in  Figure   19.1 . 
 Solving Problems with a Faulty Program 
or App  
 If a program or app on your computer stops working, there are several possible reasons:  
•  Your system might not have enough RAM, processor performance, or storage space.
•  Malware could be present.
•  The program might need an update.
•  The program might need to be uninstalled and reinstalled.
•  The program might need to be repaired.
 The following sections describe how to deal with each of these problems.  
Click or tap to enter the product key for your edition of Windows

 Caution 
 Make sure you have purchased a license for the same operating system or app version as the version already 
installed. If you have purchased a different version, the product key won’t work, and you will need to rein-
stall the version you purchased. This could cause data loss, especially if you are installing a different version 
of Windows.  
 Many vendors now store license keys for the apps you have purchased in an account page on their websites. 
Use the login credentials provided when you set up your account with the vendor to see your software 
licenses.

 Freeing Up Memory  
 A program or app might stop working because your system doesn’t have enough RAM or because 
you are running too many apps at the same time. To free up memory, close apps you are not using:  
 In Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1, from the Windows desktop taskbar:  
1.  Click on an active (highlighted) icon in the taskbar.
2.  Click the Close (X) button in the upper right-hand corner of the app window.
3.  If prompted, save changes before closing your app.
 If an app has two or more instances running (for example, two or more Word documents), follow this 
procedure to choose what to close:  
1.  Hover your mouse over the app’s icon.
2.  Click the live thumbnail for the window you want to close (see  Figure   19.7 ).
 To close a Start window app in Windows 8/8.1:  
1.  Press and hold or click and hold on the top of the app window.
2.  Drag the app window down until it disappears (see  Figure   19.8 ).

 Checking Your System’s Memory 
Size and Processor Speed  
 Some apps will not install if your computer doesn’t have enough 
RAM (memory) or a fast enough processor. However, some apps 
can be installed on systems that are not fast enough, and will not 
run well as a consequence. To determine your computer’s proces-
sor speed and installed RAM, view the system properties sheet 
(Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1 desktop) or PC Info (Windows 8/8.1 
Start screen).  
 Freeing Up Disk Space

information from systems that use SSDs is very important. Use the 
Disk Cleanup utility in Control Panel to free up space by deleting 
files and apps you don’t use.  
 Updating a Program or App  
 A program or app might stop working because of changes to your 
system, such as updates to the operating system, hardware, or soft-
ware (see “Windows System Restore and Problem Apps” later in this chapter). Or, it might work, 
but not work as well as it should. To solve these problems, update the program or app.  
 Use these methods to update a program or app:  
•  Run the program or app’s built-in updater. Depending on the
program or app, you might find this option in the Help menu or
other menus.
•  Use Windows Update. With Microsoft Windows or Microsoft
Office, use Windows Update to install updates.
•  Download and install an update from the vendor’s website. With
most apps, the update will remove out-of-date components and
install replacements.
 Uninstall/Reinstall the App  
 By uninstalling the app, you remove the app’s files, and you also remove references to the app in 
the Windows Registry, the master database of Windows software and hardware settings. When you 
reinstall the app, the settings are restored to the proper locations in the Windows Registry.  
 Before you uninstall the app, make sure you do the following:  
•  Have the license number or license key for the app if it’s a commercial app. Without it, you might
not be able to install the app, or the app might run in a reduced-feature mode.
•  Locate the installation media (CD, DVD, or download file). Some apps require that the installation
media be present before the app can be removed.
•  Deactivate the app. Some vendors won’t allow an app to be reinstalled, even on the same device,
unless you deactivate it first. See the app’s Help menu or online support website for details.
 Note 
 See “Using Disk Cleanup,” 
in  Chapter   18 , “Upgrading 
and Troubleshooting Storage 
Devices,” for details.

 To learn more about 
using Windows Update 
and enabling updates for 
Microsoft Office, see “Using 
Windows Update,” p.364, in 
 Chapter   14 , “Keeping Your 
Devices Updated.”  
 Tip 
 To locate your license key, check the following:  
 For packaged software, check the box or optical media jewel case. For downloaded apps, check your email 
(we recommend storing a copy of your licensing email in the same folder as your download for safe-
keeping). Also, many vendors now store license keys for the apps you have purchased in an account page 
on their websites. Use the login credentials provided when you set up your account with the vendor to see 
your software licenses.  

Software Troubleshooting
512
 When you reinstall the app, be sure to follow these guidelines: 
•  Right-click the app’s install program and select  Run as Administrator  (see  Figure   19.9  ). By using
this option, you help assure that the app has the permissions needed to make changes to your
system so the app will work properly.
•  Check for an updated version before you reinstall the app. If you find an update, find out if
the update can be installed, or if it must be applied as a patch after you install the version you
already have. If it can be installed, download it and install it in place of the version you already
have.
 Repairing a Program  
 The Programs and Features menu in Control Panel is used mainly for uninstalling (removing) a pro-
gram. However, some programs might offer two additional options you can use to solve problems:  
•  Change

Software Troubleshooting
514
 Using the Program Compatibility Wizard 
and Compatibility Tab  
 Windows 7 and 8/8.1 can use programs written for many earlier versions of Windows, but these pro-
grams might need to be installed in special ways to work properly with current Windows versions. 
If they are installed using their normal settings, you might see problems such as the following:  
•  The program won’t run after installation.
•  The program doesn’t use the entire display.
•  The program crashes if certain other programs are run.
 To solve problems with Windows apps not written specifically for your version of Windows, you can 
use the Program Compatibility troubleshooter or the Compatibility tab.  
 The Program Compatibility troubleshooter and Compatibility tab apply compatibility settings to an 
app (program) written for older versions of Windows to enable the app to run properly under the 
current version of Windows. The troubleshooter requires you to answer some questions and can 
apply only one setting at a time, whereas the Compatibility tab lets you apply multiple settings 
at once. In the next sections, you learn how to use both of these tools to help solve problems with 
older apps.  
 Using the Compatibility Tab  
 To use the Compatibility tab, follow these steps:  
1.  Open Windows Explorer (Windows 7) or File Explorer (Windows 8/8.1).
2.  Right-click or press and hold the program or app.
3.  Select  Properties .
4.  Click or tap the  Compatibility  tab.
5.  Choose the options you want to use for running the program.  Figure   19.11 lists the available
options for Windows 7, and  Figure   19.12  lists the available options for Windows 8.1.
6.  Click  Apply  to use the settings.
7.  Run the program. If the program runs properly, you’re finished. If the program doesn’t run prop-
erly, return to step 2 and try other settings.
 Tip 
 The fixes most often needed include the following:  
  •  Selecting the Windows version the program or app was made for.
  •  Selecting Run as Administrator.
  •  Changing display settings if the program was written for Windows versions older than Windows XP.

 Fixing Problem Apps with Regedit  
 In most cases, you should be able to repair or remove a troublesome program or app by using the 
Programs and Features menu in Windows. However, in a few cases, it might be necessary to manu-
ally remove an app or make changes to an app’s settings by using the Windows Registry editor, 
Regedit. 
 Regedit is a very powerful utility that should not be used unless you have no alternatives: it has no 
undo option, so any changes you make can’t be undone, and it’s up to you to make backup copies of 
your Windows Registry manually.  
 If you have problems with Windows or with a particular app, many vendors provide preconfigured 
REG (.reg) files that have appropriate settings needed to make the changes desired.  
 If you need to use Regedit to remove an app manually or change settings, check these resources for 
help:

 Windows System Restore and Problem 
Apps 
 If your software stops working properly after you installed a new program or app (or new hardware), 
you can return your system to its previous condition with Windows System Restore.  
 To learn how to use System Restore, see “Using System Restore,” p.218,  Chapter   8 ,
“Fixing Windows Devices That Can’t Start.”  
 Using Windows 8/8.1 Refresh  
 Use Windows 8/8.1 Refresh to fix problems with your system that are caused by incompatible boxed 
or downloaded software. Refresh removes these programs from your system, but does not remove 
apps downloaded from the Windows Store.  
 To learn more about using Refresh, see “Refresh Your PC,” p.226, in  Chapter   8 , “Fixing
Windows Devices That Can’t Start.”  
 Updating Windows Store Apps  
 In Windows 8, Windows Store apps had to be updated manually by visiting the Windows Store and 
starting the update process manually. However, in Windows 8.1, Windows Store apps are updated 
automatically.

 Image Quality Problems and Solutions  
 Whether you’re using a smartphone or point-and-shoot camera, a compact system camera, or a digi-
tal SLR, the settings you use and the cleanliness of your equipment have a big impact on the quality 
of photos you create.  
 Some of the most common problems include the following:  
•  Using auto settings instead of scenes or manual controls that would get better pictures in some
situations.
•  Relying on auto white balance instead of choosing the correct white balance settings for a scene.
•  Trusting the camera to set the exposure under any circumstances, even when your pictures are
too light (overexposed) or too dark (underexposed) photos.
•  Choosing the wrong zoom setting for your subject.
•  Not cleaning your camera lens or filter.
•  Not cleaning your camera’s image sensor.
•  Assuming that autofocus always works.
•  Not getting your subject in focus.
•  Subject is moving too fast.
•  Shaking the camera during shooting.

CHAPTER
 Fortunately, there are simple solutions to each of these problems, 
no matter what type of camera or smartphone you use.  
 Changing Settings  
 Digital cameras and smartphones use Auto mode by default. In this 
mode, the only decision you’re making about photography is when 
to take the picture; your device chooses everything else.  
 The control dial or menu options in your digital camera or smart-
phone camera app provide additional options:  
•  Preset scene modes that can improve photos at sunrise, sunset,
when the light is behind the subject, indoors, and more
•  Access to manual adjustments for white balance, exposure, and so on
 If your camera has a full-fledged control dial like the one shown in  Figure   20.1 , choose P (Program) 
mode if you want point-and-shoot ease along with the ability to adjust color and exposure settings. 
The S or Tv (shutter priority), A or Av (aperture priority), and M (manual) options provide these 
options and more control over your photo.  
 Some point-and-shoot cameras have a simplified control dial that emphasizes scene modes ( see 
Figure   20.2   ). To choose options for color and exposure settings, select P or M.  
 The Camera app on an Android smartphone also includes many of these options ( see Figure   20.3 ).

CHAPTER
 Scene Mode  
 If you want to improve your pictures but don’t want to get bogged down in details, try your cam-
era’s scene mode. Almost all digital cameras, from cheapies to expensive models, feature several 
customized settings, as do some smartphone camera apps.  
 Scene mode provides preset options designed to enhance photos you take in particular situations. 
Each scene setting has adjustments for settings such as white balance, color, sharpness, shutter 
speed, lens opening (aperture or f/stop), single-shot or burst mode, and sharpness already included. 
It’s up to you to choose the right scene for a situation.  
 To use a scene setting, follow these steps:  
1.  Turn on your device’s scene mode. Some cameras feature a few scene modes on the control dial,
with additional scenes available from a menu.
2.  Look at the list of scene settings (see  Figure   20.4 ).
 Note 
 The Camera app included in iOS is designed to adjust images after you shoot them. If you want more 
control over the shooting process itself, many iOS camera apps offer more controls, and there are many 
Android camera apps with additional features beyond those included in the basic Android app. See  
www.forbes.com/sites/amadoudiallo/2013/06/14/best-camera-apps-ios-android/ for a useful review of iOS and 
Android camera apps.

3.  Compare your subject to the scene settings available.
4.  Choose a setting that best matches your subject.
5.  Take pictures.
 Figure   20.5   illustrates how choosing the right scene setting can enhance your photos.  
 There are two problems with using scene mode:  
•  If you choose the wrong scene setting, you can make the picture worse.
•  No camera in the world features enough scene settings to handle every possible situation.
 So, if you want to get even better photos, consider using additional options available in most cam-
eras and some smartphone camera apps.  
 Color Problems  
 Light has different colors, depending on when you shoot. At dawn and dusk, and indoors under 
incandescent or warm-white fluorescent bulbs, the light is yellowish or red. On a sunny day, the 
light is neutral. But when it’s cloudy or overcast, the light becomes bluish.  
 If you use auto white balance (the default setting on both digital cameras and smartphones), you’re 
hoping that the camera can figure out both the color of the light and the color of the subject. Auto 
white balance can sometimes do a decent job of rendering a scene, but even at its best, it can’t 
capture all the colors you’d see if you use the best white balance setting available.  Figure   20.6 illus-
trates the difference between auto and daylight white balance on a sunny day.

CHAPTER
  Choosing the Best White Balance Setting  
 To get the best colors, use the white balance setting on your camera or smartphone and choose a 
setting that matches the time of day or the lighting in the room  
 Typical settings include the following:  
•  Auto — Use this if a preset white balance setting doesn’t work, or if there’s more than one kind of
light in the room (for example, window plus incandescent or fluorescent lighting).
•  Incandescent (tungsten) — Removes excess yellow from indoor lighting, including warm-white
CFLs as well as incandescent and halogen bulbs.
•  Daylight —   Use on sunny days after sunrise and before sunset for accurate and vivid color.
•  Fluorescent — Use with tube-type fluorescent bulbs or similar greenish-white lights. Some digital
cameras have two or more fluorescent settings, so try more than one.
•  Cloudy —  Removes excess blue caused by cloudy, overcast days.
•  Open shade — A stronger effect than cloudy.
•  Electronic flash (speedlight) — Removes excess blue from electronic flash.
•  Custom — Uses a white card under the same light as the subject to get the most accurate white
balance.

 Tip 
 If you can’t use custom white balance, take a picture of the scene using auto white balance and look for 
an object that is supposed to be white. Take pictures using different white balance settings until the object 
is as close to pure white as possible (in other words, no blue, red, or yellow cast). If you can’t find a white 
object to shoot, just look at the overall colors and choose the best white balance based on which one pro-
duces the colors that most closely match what you see.  

Digital Camera Troubleshooting
528
  Changing White Balance Settings  
 Look for a button called WB or an onscreen setting called AUTO or AWB. See your camera manual 
on how to find this setting and change it.  Figure   20.7 shows typical white balance settings on digi-
tal cameras and an Android smartphone.  
 Although you might have fewer options when you use your smartphone’s front-facing camera for 
selfies, white balance adjustment, if present, can help you get a more accurate picture of yourself 
and your friends. In  Figure   20.8 , we switched from auto white balance (which produced an orange 
skin tone under indoor light) to Incandescent for more normal colors.

 Exposure Problems  
 Your digital camera or smartphone sets the exposure for you, but it doesn’t always get it right. 
Bright or dark areas next to or behind the main subject often fool these devices into producing pho-
tos that are too dark or too light.  
 The exposure compensation (EV or AV) adjustment button and menu ( Figure   20.9 ) lets you add light 
or take away light to help solve these problems. +1 doubles the light, and -1 removes half the light.

CHAPTER
 Image Blur (Out of Focus)  
 Your camera and smartphone have autofocus to help you get sharper pictures. However, shooting 
through windows, screens, wire, or other objects between you and your subject help guarantee that 
your device will focus on what you don’t want.  
 If you use a digital SLR or mirrorless (compact system) camera, use manual focus in situations like 
these. Push the button on the lens and use the manual focus ring as you view your subject ( see 
Figure   20.12  ). 
 With a point-and-shoot camera, use prefocusing: aim your camera at a point about the same dis-
tance as your subject with about the same lighting, hold down the shutter button halfway to lock 
exposure and focus, frame your photo, and shoot. Some camera apps for smartphones and tablets 
have the same feature.  
 What is the simplest way to avoid out-of-focus pictures when there’s a fence or wire between you 
and your subject? Move up to the fence and point your camera through an opening in the fence.  
 Caution 
 If the subject is within 10 feet of your position, you can also use flash to lighten it up. However, keep in 
mind that flash can cause glare on glasses and shiny objects, can cause red-eye in dim light, and will run 
down your camera or smartphone battery faster.  
 If your flash doesn’t fire, change the setting from Auto Flash to Flash (also called forced flash) so it will fire 
no matter the lighting conditions.

 Camera Shake  
 Camera shake happens when you move your camera during your shot ( see Figure   20.13 ). In this 
example, you can see the streaks of light indicating the direction of camera movement.  
 There are many ways to avoid camera shake when using a digital camera. One way is to adjust the 
shutter speed, particularly if you don’t use equipment with image stabilization: 
•  Use the shutter priority (S or Tv) setting on your digital camera and use a shutter speed of
1/125-second or faster with the lens included with the camera (the “kit” lens, typically 18–55mm
or 18–135mm).
•  Use faster shutter speeds (1/250-second or faster) with longer lenses. Longer lenses bring distant
subjects closer and also make camera shake more apparent.
•  Make sure you use image stabilization (IS), optical stabilization (OS), or vibration reduction (VR)
features when available. This feature compensates for camera shake. It is included with some
lenses for Canon and Nikon digital SLR cameras ( see Figure   20.15 ) and is built in to the camera
body for other types of cameras.

 To adjust shutter speed manually, follow these steps:  
1.  Turn the camera control dial to S (most brands) or Tv (Canon cameras).
2.  For a faster shutter speed, select a smaller value.
3.  For a slower shutter speed, select a larger value. See  Figure   20.14  .
 As you can see from  Figure   20.16 , image stabilization can significantly improve the sharpness of 
photos you take using slow shutter speeds.

•  Increase the ISO (higher ISO number) to reduce the amount of
light needed to take a picture. Use ISO 100–400 outdoors, ISO
400–800 indoors, and ISO 800 or higher for fast action under
dim light.
•  Use electronic flash if the subject is less than 10 feet away.
Electronic flash “freezes” action.
•  Use a tripod in dim light. If you use a tripod, don’t enable
image stabilization.
 With a smartphone:  
•  Get a tripod made for a smartphone.
•  Brace the phone against a wall or pole.
•  Hold the phone with both hands.
•  Increase the ISO.
•  Use electronic flash if the subject is less than 10 feet away.
 Motion Blur  
 Motion blur, like camera shake, happens when your shutter speed is too slow. The difference is that 
the subject, rather than the camera, is moving too quickly for a sharp picture.

CHAPTER
 A little motion blur ( see Figure   20.17 ) can enhance the photo. By shooting subjects at different shut-
ter speeds, you can decide which shutter speed works better.  
  Viewing Settings Used for a Photo  
 Before digital photography, you needed to use a notebook to record your camera’s settings. Today, 
the camera does the job for you. It records information about the shutter speed, aperture (f/stop), 
ISO, and other settings used by your camera. This information is known as metadata. To see the 
metadata for a photo, follow these steps:  
1.  Open Windows Explorer or File Explorer.
2.  Navigate to the location where your photo is stored.
3.  Right-click or press and hold the picture file, and select  Properties .
4.  Click or tap the  Details  tab.
5.  Scroll down to the Camera section ( see Figure   20.18 ).
6.  After viewing the metadata, click  OK .

 Wrong Lens or Zoom Setting  
 Digital SLR and mirrorless (compact system) cameras typically come equipped with a 3× or 4× zoom 
lens that can be interchanged with other lenses. Point-and-shoot cameras don’t have removable 
lenses, but the zoom range can be up to 30× or longer. You can also add a self-contained lens-style 
camera that communicates with your smartphone or add-on lenses that fit over your existing smart-
phone. 
 Table   20.2  lists some basic guidelines for zoom ratios or zoom lenses to help you get better pictures 
of people.

 Dirty Lens  
 A dirty lens on your camera or smartphone reduces sharpness and can cause blurry photos.  
Figure   20.20   shows the results of shooting with an extremely dirty lens (fingerprints and a bit of 
smeary moisture) versus a clean lens.  
 To clean a lens or filter on your camera or smartphone, do the following:  
1.  Gently remove any loose dirt specks or sand from the surface of the lens.
2.  If you use a premoistened lens cleaning cloth, move it gently across the surface of the lens using
a rotary motion.

3.  If you use a microfiber cloth and lens cleaning fluid, spray one corner of the cloth and then move
it gently across the surface of the lens using a rotary motion.
4.  Use a dry microfiber cloth to remove any lens fluid residue.
 Dirty Image Sensor  
 Image sensors receive the light from the lens and convert it into electrical impulses that are stored 
on your camera’s memory card. Image sensors on digital SLR (DSLR) and mirrorless compact cam-
eras can become dirty when you change lenses.  
 If your image sensor has multiple spots, as in  Figure   20.21 , the results can ruin your photo, or at the 
very least require a lot of retouching to fix. Keep in mind that retouching an image can violate photo 
contest rules and journalism ethics, so it’s best to keep your image sensor clean!  
 To remove spots on the image sensor, you can send your camera in for service, or, if your camera 
has a special mode that moves the mirror and shutter out of the way, you can clean the sensor 
yourself. Be sure to ask for an estimate before you send your camera in for sensor cleaning. With an 
older or low-end camera, the service cost might exceed the camera’s value.

Shooting in RAW Mode

CHAPTER
 Shooting in RAW Mode  
 RAW mode, available on almost all digital SLRs and mirrorless cameras and some advanced point-
and-shoot cameras, has many advantages over shooting in the normal JPEG mode:  
•  Complete control over white balance — If you forgot to change white balance before shooting,
or the white balance setting you chose didn’t match the scene lighting closely enough, you can
select the perfect white balance setting after you shoot the picture.
•  Full image quality — JPEG photos use compression to create relatively small image sizes, but as
a consequence, RAW photos are larger andsharper.
•  Greater control over color, contrast, brightness, highlights, shadows, and other image
settings — You can fine-tune every photo to produce the best results (see  Figure   20.22 ).
•  Group photo editing — Whether you use the RAW image editor included with your digital cam-
era or a third-party program such as Adobe Camera RAW, you can select a group of photos shot
under the same conditions and make a single set of edits.
 Potential drawbacks to shooting in RAW:  
•  RAW photos are about three times larger than the highest-quality JPEG photos — Thus, you
can’t take as many pictures per memory card as with JPEG.

•  RAW photos take longer to shoot — If you want to shoot in burst mode, JPEG is a better choice
in terms of speed.
•  RAW photos also need additional software to view and edit them — Digital cameras that sup-
port RAW mode usually include RAW editing software. However, if you want to see thumbnails
of your RAW photos rather than icons, you will also need a RAW codec.
 Some cameras offer the option to save RAW and JPEG versions of a photo at the same time. This 
uses much more space on the memory card than JPEG or RAW alone but is handy if you need JPEG 
files for immediate use but want a RAW version for editing later.

 Note 
 Get RAW codes from the following sources:  
  •  Your camera vendor — Check the discs that are included with your camera, or check the website.
  •  Third-party sources —  I recommend FastPictureViewer’s codec, which works with almost any RAW file
type. It’s available from  www.fastpictureviewer.com/codecs/ . I have also used Ardfry’s codecs, available
from  www.ardfry.com .
  •  Microsoft — The Microsoft Camera Codec Pack can be downloaded from the Microsoft website
( www.microsoft.com ) for Windows 7 as well as Windows Vista SP2. Windows 8/8.1 users can get it
from Windows Update.

Slow Burst Mode
20
CHAPTER
 Slow Burst Mode  
 If you use the Sports setting on some cameras, you can shoot multiple pictures by holding down the 
shutter button. This option, often called Burst mode, can also be selected from a camera or smart-
phone menu and is helpful when you’re trying to capture fast action or the “peak of the moment.”  
 If your camera slows down after shooting a few shots in Burst (continuous) mode, there are several 
reasons why:  
•  Older digital cameras have smaller buffer memory sizes (the buffer holds the photos tempo-
rarily until they can be saved to flash memory )—The only solution to this problem is to replace
your camera with one that has a better Burst mode.
•  You’re shooting in RAW rather than JPEG mode — RAW produces better quality photos than
JPEG, but if you want more frames per second (fps), shoot in JPEG.
•  Your memory card is too slow — SD-family (SD, SDHC, and SDXC) cards are speed-rated using
either the class or UHS identifiers.
 Switching to JPEG from RAW  
 If you need maximum burst speed (highest frames per second rate), it’s time to temporarily put 
aside RAW and return to JPEG. Be sure to use the highest-quality JPEG setting offered by your cam-
era and set your white balance accurately.  
 After you’re done shooting in Burst mode, you can reset your camera to RAW mode for maximum 
image quality. See your camera’s instruction manual for details.  
 Choosing Fast Flash-Memory Cards  
 Class 2, 4, 6, and 10 cards feature read/write speed corresponding to the class rating (2MBps–
10MBps). 
 Some, but not all, Class 10 cards also support UHS Speed Class 1 (10MBps read/write). SDHC and 
SDXC cards that support UHS Speed Class 1 or Class 3 (30MBps read/write) support the new high-
speed UHS bus but will revert to the older Class 10 speed when connected to devices that do not 
include UHS support.  
 Figure   20.23   compares SDHC and microSDHC cards with different speed ratings.  
 If you use a digital SLR or mirrorless compact camera, using Class 10 or UHS1 cards instead of 
slower cards will improve burst speed. And, if you use your camera to shoot video, these cards will 
also enable you to shoot smooth 1080p (full HD) video.

 Understanding SD, SDHC, and SDXC Cards  
 SD, SDHC, and SDXC cards have the same form factor and write-protect switch. However, their inter-
nal features mean that many older devices can’t use all these card types. The following capacities 
listed here apply to standard-size, mini, and microSD cards. 
 Secure Digital (SD) cards have capacities up to 2GB. SDHC (SD High Capacity) cards have capaci-
ties up to 32GB. SDXC (SD eXtended Capacity) cards have capacities of 64GB and greater. A device 
compatible with SDXC cards also supports SD and SDHC cards. A device compatible with SDHC cards 
also supports SD cards, but not SDXC cards. A device compatible with SD cards only cannot use the 
other types.  
 If you want to buy a larger memory card for your camera, be sure to check its specifications to find 
out which types and sizes of cards it can use.

File Transfer Problems
20
CHAPTER
 File Transfer Problems  
 After you take your digital photos, you’ll probably want to get them into your computer. You may 
have been frustrated by issues such as these:  
•  Your camera shuts down during transfer.
•  You keep copying the same pictures over and over if you don’t copy all your pictures at the same
time.
•  Your pictures all wind up in the same folder, making it hard to find the ones you want.
•  You’re tired of tying up your camera while you transfer pictures.
 The following sections provide solutions for you.  
 Avoiding Camera-to-Computer File Transfer Problems  
 If you connect your camera to your computer to transfer your photos, you’ve probably battled one of 
these problems:  
•  Computer won’t recognize camera — To get the computer and camera to “talk” to each other,
select the playback option on your camera.
•  Camera shuts off during transfer — The culprit is the camera’s automatic shutoff feature. You can
increase the time before the camera shuts off, but it’s often just as easy to gently tap the cam-
era’s shutter button periodically during the transfer process.
 If you’ve lost your transfer cable, this would be a great time to opt for a card reader if your computer 
or printer doesn’t have one already. However, if you travel with your digital camera, having a trans-
fer cable makes sharing photos with family and friends easier: just copy the photos to their comput-
ers rather than emailing them or burning a CD or DVD.  
 You could order a replacement from the camera vendor, but be 
prepared for sticker shock. Before you buy a replacement, check 
the connector on your camera. If your camera uses a five-pin mini-
USB or micro-USB connector, you might already have a suitable 
cable (five-pin mini USB is used by many external USB devices, and 
micro USB is used by most Android smartphones). If you have two 
or more digital cameras that use different cables, look for a multi-
headed cable.  
 Using and Troubleshooting a Card 
Reader  
 Instead of running down your camera battery and watching as the 
action passes you by, transfer your pictures by using a card reader. 
You can switch memory cards and continue shooting and transfer 
your pictures later.  
 Tip 
 If your digital camera uses a 
proprietary connector, check 
third-party sources such as 
Amazon.com,  www.dcables.
net , or cablewholesale.com.  
 Note 
 If your digital camera needs a 
firmware update, many ven-
dors require you to use a card 
reader to copy the firmware 
file from your computer to 
your camera.  

Digital Camera Troubleshooting
544
 Although many late-model desktop and laptop computers have 
card readers, you might have discovered that  
•  The card reader isn’t compatible with your memory card form
factor (for example, if your camera uses Compact Flash and
your card reader works with SD cards).
•  The card reader isn’t compatible with SDHC or SDXC cards.
•  The card reader can’t read your memory cards.
 Before you buy a new card reader, though, take a look at your 
inkjet printer or all-in-one device. The card slots on many of these 
models aren’t just for direct printing: they also double as card 
readers so you can transfer your pictures.  
 Wondering if your card reader is working? The easiest way is to insert your card and see if the 
AutoPlay dialog appears (see  Figure   20.24 ). 
 Tip 
 If you see an error message 
such as Insert a disk into ____ 
after you inserted the media, 
the card reader might not 
be working properly. If the 
card can be read by another 
reader, the reader you tried 
first is incompatible or defec-
tive and should be replaced.

 Note 
 You can also use this method to see if your digital camera is recognized by your computer. If the AutoPlay 
menu does not appear after you set your camera for playback, you might need to install a driver program 
for your camera.

File Transfer Problems

CHAPTER
 There are three ways you can connect a card reader to your computer:  
•  Internal card readers connect to a USB header on your motherboard.
•  External readers connect to a USB 2.0 port.
•  High-performance external readers connect to a USB 3.0 port.
 Figure   20.25   illustrates typical internal and external card readers.  
 I have tried various brands of aftermarket internal card reader-USB port combination devices on sev-
eral of my desktop computers and have seen most of them fail. Although your results may vary, my 
experience has convinced me that USB-based external card readers are better. If you have a desktop 
computer with an internal USB card reader that no longer works, I strongly recommend ignoring it 
and using an external model instead.  
 External models are available with support for a single type of card (for example, SD/SDHC/SDXC, 
Sony MemoryStick, or Compact Flash). I prefer multislot versions because my extended family uses 
a mixture of memory cards in their cameras. Multislot versions may assign a different drive letter to 
each card, so you can copy between cards (refer to  Figure   20.26 ), or it may assign one drive letter to 
the entire reader.  
 Here’s how you can tell which type of multislot card reader you have:  
1.  If the card reader is already connected, disconnect it.
2.  Open Windows Explorer or File Explorer.
3.  Note the drive letters shown.
4.  Connect the card reader.
5.  After Windows recognizes it, note the number of new drive letters. If your reader has multiple
slots, but only one additional drive letter is displayed, your reader can use only one card at a
time. If you see multiple drive letters, you can use more than one card at a time.

 Although USB 2.0 card readers still dominate the market, there are an increasing number of USB 3.0 
card readers. USB 3.0 is up to 10 times faster than USB 2.0, and most late-model computers have a 
mixture of USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports.  
 Even if your current computer lacks USB 3.0 ports, I recommend that you purchase a USB 3.0 card 
reader. You can plug it into a USB 2.0 port now (it will run at USB 2.0 speeds), but when you have a 
USB 3.0 port, your card reader will be ready to transfer pictures at much faster speeds.  
 Better Picture Transfer Without Duplications  
 When your digital camera or memory card is detected by Windows, you’ll typically see an AutoPlay 
menu displayed (refer to  Figure   20.24 ). Depending on the choices you make, you can make picture 
transfer a pleasant experience or a painful one.  
 The exact contents of the AutoPlay menu for a drive depend on the programs installed on your com-
puter and the media type or types on your drive.  
 If you run Windows Explorer or File Explorer to view your photos, it’s up to you to decide which 
folders they’re copied to. If you forget which photos you copied, you could copy them over and over.  
 Your memory card may have pictures taken at many times and places. If you use the standard 
Windows import program (Import Pictures and Videos Using Windows—see  Figure   20.27 ), all new 
pictures (pictures that have not been imported before) are transferred, and any tags you apply are 
assigned to all photos (see  Figure   20.27 ). To change how folder names are created, you can open the 
Options menu link shown in  Figure   20.26 . 
 If you have a photo editing program, its import function might have other options, including the 
capability to select the photos you want to transfer. That’s useful if you use your camera frequently 
but don’t want to erase the card until you’ve filled it up.

CHAPTER
 If you don’t have a better photo import program already, I recommend the free Microsoft Windows 
Essentials program (available from  http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/essentials ). It 
includes Windows Photo Gallery (which includes import, photo tagging, organizing, and JPEG photo 
editing) and Movie Maker, as well as other utilities. It works with Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1.  
 When you run Windows Photo Gallery’s transfer program from AutoPlay, your photos are organized 
by date and time. You can name each group of photos whatever you like, and the tags you apply to 
a group apply only to that group ( see Figure   20.28 ). Windows Photo Gallery when used with stan-
dard settings will not rename your photos. Windows Photo Gallery does not select already-imported 
photos by default, but you can select them manually for reimporting.

 Memory Card Problems and Solutions  
 Almost all digital cameras use flash memory cards for storage, so knowing how to use these cards 
properly is important. In this section, you’ll learn the best ways to prepare a memory card for reuse 
and what to do if you can’t read a card or if you accidentally remove pictures from a card.

 Caution 
 Before you remove a memory card from your camera, make sure you turn off the camera. To remove a 
memory card from your computer, make sure the card is not being accessed. Following these procedures 
reduces the possibility of memory card read errors.  

549
Protecting Your Equipment
20
CHAPTER
 Emptying the Contents of a Memory Card  
 Flash memory cards are designed to be reusable. To do this, you need to remove the photos from 
the card so you can use it again. There are several ways to do this:  
•  Delete the photos after you import them with Windows photo import or Windows Photo
Gallery — If you use this option, you slow down the import process tremendously. And, if you dis-
cover that some photos didn’t import properly, you would need to use a data recovery program to
find them.
•  Delete the photos with Windows Explorer or File Explorer — You can select all the photos at one
time for deletion, but this is slower than using format.
•  Format the card using Windows Explorer or File Explorer — If you use this option, the camera
must re-create the folders it uses for storage (DCIM and subfolders, plus other folders used by
the camera).
•  Format the card using your digital camera’s format feature — This is the recommended method;
it works quickly, re-creates the necessary folders, and makes sure the card is completely ready
for use by the camera.
 Fixing Data Errors and Recovering Lost Photos  
 If you are unable to read some or all of the pictures on a card, or if you have accidentally formatted 
or erased a card, use the data recovery methods discussed in “Recovering ‘Lost’ Data,” p.456, in 
 Chapter   18  , “Upgrade and Troubleshoot Storage.”  
 Protecting Your Equipment  
 Whether you’re using or storing your digital camera and accessories, you need to protect your 
investment in equipment and, even more important, in the photos you’ve created. Follow these 
guidelines to help keep your equipment safe.  
 Protective Filters  
 You can spend hundreds of dollars on each lens you buy for your digital SLR, mirrorless camera, or 
smartphone camera, but a few scratches on the front of the lens can turn your investment into junk. 
 Tip 
 To fix any problems with the structure of the memory card, select the low-level format option (if available) 
when you format your memory card using your camera. If your camera lacks this option, use the Format 
option in Windows Explorer or File Explorer and clear the Use Quick Format check box. See “Using Format 
to Solve Disk Errors,” p.452, in  Chapter   18 , “Upgrade and Troubleshoot Storage.”  

Digital Camera Troubleshooting
550
You can protect that investment by using a protective filter (also 
called a UV filter) on each of your lenses.  
 How can you get the right size for your lens? The size is listed 
on the front ring of some lenses or the side of others ( see Figure 
 20.29 ). Sometimes the front lens cap included with your lens also 
has the size marking.  
 To help reduce glare, filters have an anti-reflective coating. The 
most effective type of coating has two or more layers and is 
known as multicoating. Multicoated filters reflect light much less than single-coated or uncoated 
lenses do, which enables your photos to be sharper and have better contrast when direct sunlight 
enters the lens.  
 Lens and Body Caps  
 When you purchase a new digital SLR or mirrorless camera, the lens mount on the camera body 
is normally protected by a body cap. Remove the body cap to install a lens, but keep the body cap 
around in case you need to store the body without a lens on it. A camera body without a lens can 
get dust or spots on the image sensor.  
 Lenses for your digital SLR or mirrorless camera include a front and rear lens cap. The front lens cap 
can be snapped over the protective filter or other filters on the front of the lens. The rear lens cap 
has flanges corresponding to the flanges on the camera body; the rear lens cap is turned to lock it 
into place.  
 Note 
 Filters and adapters for Sony 
QX-100 are available from 
various vendors, including

CHAPTER
 Changing Lenses  
 When you change lenses, follow these guidelines to avoid damage to your lenses or your camera:  
•  Use the rear lens cap from the lens you are installing on the rear of the lens you are removing.
Rear lens caps for any lens for the same type of camera body are interchangeable.
•  Avoid placing a lens front-end down unless you have a lens cap on it. You could scratch the lens
if it has no filter or scratch the filter on the front of the lens.
•  Shield the lens opening on your camera body from dust and dirt when a lens is not mounted on
the camera.
•  Inspect the front and back of your lenses for dust and dirt. Clean them when necessary, as dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter.
 Cases 
 Cases are available in a variety of sizes and shapes. To protect your equipment, keep it in a case 
when you’re not using it.  
 If you want to carry additional lenses or other equipment when you’re shooting, look for a case that 
has room for additional components; is easy to carry; and is easy to access when it’s time to switch 
lenses, memory cards, or cards.  
 Many users have switched from traditional gadget bags to backpack or sling-type bags. To learn 
more about the different types of camera bags available, check out vendors such as these:

 Lens Compatibility Problems and 
Solutions  
 It would be great if you could buy a lens for your camera after trying it on your camera. 
Unfortunately, with the great decline in brick-and-mortar camera stores and the rise of online and 
big-box retailers and used sales via eBay, your next lens purchase may be sight unseen. Here are 
some ways to avoid disappointment as you shop for either new or used lenses.  

Digital Camera Troubleshooting
552
 Checking Model Numbers and Terminologies  
 Before you can make an intelligent decision about a lens, you need to know the brand, specifications 
(focal length, aperture, and features), model number, and revision.  
  Nikon AF Versus AF-S Model Numbers 
 Nikon digital SLR cameras can use most Nikon-mount lenses 
manufactured since 1977. However, there are limitations and 
exceptions. For example, both AF and AF-S lenses are autofocus. 
AF-S lenses can be used on any Nikon digital SLR but must be 
used on models that lack a built-in autofocus motor (D40 series, 
D3XXX series, D5XXX series). These cameras cannot use AF 
lenses, which use an autofocus motor built in to the camera body.  
  Canon Revisions and Lens Types  
 The revision number indicates changes in the lens design. For 
example, the (discontinued) Canon 50mm f/1.8 Mark I lens has a metal lens mount, whereas the cur-
rent Mark II version has a plastic lens mount, making it lighter but less durable.  
 Canon EF lenses work with both full-frame digital (and all auto-
focus film) SLRs and with consumer digital SLR models that use 
smaller image sensors (Canon digital Rebel series, D60, D70, 
and so on). However, Canon EF-S lenses have a deeper rear lens 
mount and work only with the Canon DSLR models with smaller 
image sensors.  
 What if you’re not sure which lenses you can use on your Canon 
DSLR camera? Check the lens mount on the camera body. If you 
see a red dot and a white square, your camera can use both EF 
(red dot) and EF-S (white square) lenses.  
  Tamron Lens Terminology  
 Tamron uses many terms as part of its lens model numbers. Understanding these terms can help 
you choose the lenses that work best for you and your camera. Following are some of the most 
common: 
•  VC — Lenses with vibration compensation (image stabilization), enabling you to shoot with slower
shutter speeds and avoid camera shake.
•  FTM — Lenses with autofocus and full-time manual focus, enabling manual focus without turning
off autofocus.
•  Di — Lenses compatible with both full-frame and APS-C image sensor sizes.
•  Di-II — Lenses designed for APS-C (crop) image sensors. Not compatible with full-frame digital
SLRs.
 Note 
 Cameras with smaller-than-
35mm film image sensor sizes 
are often referred to as hav-
ing an APS-C sensor (this is a 
now-obsolete consumer film 
camera size) or as having a 
“crop” sensor.

  Sigma Lens Terminology  
 Sigma uses many terms as part of its lens model numbers. 
Understanding these terms can help you choose the lenses that 
work best for you and your camera. Following are some of the most 
common: 
•  DC — Lenses designed for APS-C (crop) image sensors. Not compatible with full-frame digital
SLRs.
•  DG — Lenses compatible with both full-frame and APS-C image sensor sizes.
•  DN — Lenses made for mirrorless (compact system) cameras.
•  OS — Optically stabilized lenses, so you can shoot with slower
shutter speeds and avoid camera shake.
•  HSM — Lenses with high-speed autofocus motor.
•  APO — Lenses with two or more elements of special glass
designed to minimize chromatic aberration (color fringing).
  Tokina Lens Terminology  
 Tokina uses many terms as part of its lens model numbers. Understanding these terms can help you 
choose the lenses that work best for you and your camera. Following are some of the most common:  
•  VCM — Lenses with vibration compensation (image stabilization), enabling you to shoot with
slower shutter speeds and avoid camera shake.
•  IF — Lenses with internal focusing, which enables the lens barrel to stay the same length during
focus and have a nonrotating front ring.
•  FC — Lenses with focus clutch enable you to switch between
autofocus and manual focus from the focus ring.
•  FX —Lenses designed for both full-frame and APS-C (crop) image
sensors.
•  DX — Lenses designed for APS-C (crop) image sensors only.
 Lens Re-chipping  
 Both digital SLR cameras and the lenses they use are computerized, so it’s possible to have a situ-
ation in which a third-party lens might be mechanically but not electronically compatible with a 
camera body.

Digital Camera Troubleshooting
554
 Electronic incompatibility has been a big problem with early Sigma lenses made for Canon EOS film 
autofocus cameras. Although the EOS (EF) lens mount is mechan-
ically the same for both Canon film and digital SLR cameras, 
Sigma’s original EF-compatible lenses (manufactured up to about 
1998) don’t work properly with Canon digital SLR cameras. Many 
of these older lenses are still used.  
 The most common problem is that the lens will not adjust the 
aperture (f/stop) when necessary. Some also had problems with 
incorrect autofocusing. Newer models will work because the elec-
tronics have been improved inside the camera lenses.  
 At one time, Sigma offered re-chipping services for affected 
lenses. Unfortunately, supplies of these chips have been exhausted because these lenses have not 
been produced for many years. So, what can you do?  
•  It is possible to perform a “do-it-yourself” chip replacement. See  www.martinmelchior.be/
2013/04/conversion-of-old-sigma-lens-to-work.html  for the process and parts list.
•  If you use your lenses primarily in dim light or indoors (where you’d probably use the lens at its
maximum aperture), try shooting in Aperture priority (A or Av mode) and set the aperture to the
lenses’ maximum aperture.
•  Sell these lenses to users still shooting film.
 Lens Adapters  
 If you have a collection of lenses made for 35mm SLR cameras, 
it is possible to use them with a modern digital SLR. Both Nikon 
and Pentax autofocus bodies have a high degree of backward 
compatibility with manual focus lenses.  
 To use manual-focus lenses from these and other vendors 
(Olympus, Canon FL/FD, and so on) with other autofocus SLRs, 
you will need specially designed lens adapters.  
 These adapters are designed to accept the lens as if it’s connect-
ing to the original lens mount, and the other end of the adapter is 
designed to fit into a different camera body.  
 Lens adapters typically don’t support automatic exposure modes and have other limitations. Some 
include a chip that helps confirm correct manual focus.  
 The most common sources for adapters designed to enable lenses for one mount to work with 
another mount are based in China and typically sell through eBay.  
 Adapters made by the camera vendor to support different camera types, on the other hand, are 
available from major camera stores. These include Olympus, which makes an adapter for its 
FourThirds lenses to work with Micro FourThirds mirrorless camera bodies, and Canon, which 
makes an adapter for its EF lens to fit its EOS-M mirrorless camera bodies.  
 Caution 
 When shopping for used 
Sigma lenses for Canon auto-
focus SLR cameras, models 
identified as for film only will 
not work with Canon digital 
SLR cameras.

Installing Firmware Updates
20
CHAPTER
 Installing Firmware Updates  
 Digital cameras are computers optimized for picture taking. And, just as computers use firmware 
(software on a chip) to control basic operations, so do digital cameras. Digital SLR and mirrorless 
cameras have upgradeable firmware, as do some high-end point-and-shoot cameras. Some lenses 
also have upgradeable firmware.  
 Why upgrade firmware? To name just a few benefits, upgraded firmware can  
•  Add features
•  Improve connectivity to computers
•  Improve shooting performance
•  Add support for larger memory cards
•  Provide faster electronic viewfinder (EVF) performance
•  Improve autofocus
•  Improve audio recording in camcorder mode
 Firmware updates can be installed in a variety of ways:  
•  Via a live connection to the Internet via your computer’s USB port
•  By copying the firmware file to a specially prepared flash memory card
•  By copying the firmware file via USB
 Before installing a firmware update:  
1.  Check the current firmware version installed in your camera.
2.  Compare the installed firmware version with the latest version.
3.  Review the changes in the latest version.
4.  Install fully charged batteries in your camera or connect it to an AC adapter.
5.  Review the instructions for the update.
 Be sure to follow the instructions exactly, and don’t shut off your camera until the update is 
finished. 
 Note 
 To find firmware updates for your camera, check your camera vendor’s website, or check the DPReview 
Firmware and Software Updates page at  www.dpreview.com/news/category/FirmwareAndSoftwareUpdates . 

Digital Camera Troubleshooting

 Battery Failure and Replacement  
 Battery failure will turn your digital camera into a useless (and expensive) hunk of plastic, metal, 
and glass. To avoid it, we recommend the following:  
•  Always have at least one spare fully charged battery or battery set. If you plan to shoot all day,
have at least two fully charged spare batteries or battery sets.
•  Don’t forget your charger! If you travel with your camera, consider buying a universal charger
you can carry with you so you don’t need to worry about losing your primary charger in a hotel
room somewhere. Universal chargers that work on both AC and 12V DC outlets enable you to
charge your batteries while you’re on the go.
•  If your camera or electronic flash uses AA batteries, don’t use
cheap batteries. Buy top-of-the line alkaline or, for maximum
life, lithium batteries.
•  If your camera or electronic flash uses AA batteries, consider
using rechargeable batteries if the unit supports them.

 Video Quality Problems and Solutions  
 Whether you shoot video with a camcorder, some type of digital camera, a smartphone or tablet, or 
an action camera, you can have problems with video quality, color, exposure, image blur, and sound. 
In the following sections, we’ll help you find the answers you need.  
 Selecting the Best Resolution  
 The number of pixels (dots) that your camcorder captures is 
directly related to the quality of your videos. If you shoot video 
with a higher resolution (more dots), you get better quality video 
than with a lower resolution.  
 Devices that shoot video typically offer two or more resolution 
settings (see  Figure   21.1 ). The tradeoff is higher quality equals 
shorter recording time. We recommend that you shoot at the 
highest quality or resolution your camera can produce, especially 
if you plan to view the recording on an HDTV or use it in a video 
project. Remember, you can always reduce quality or resolution 
for specific needs, but you can’t restore quality that was lost dur-
ing the initial recording.  
 Figure   21.1  shows the resolution selection dialog on a Samsung 
Galaxy SIII Smartphone.  
 Note 
 Understanding camera types:  
 Camcorder —A camera designed to shoot video. It might take still photos, but as a secondary use.  
 HD camcorder —A camcorder that shoots video at 720p, 1080i, or 1080p resolutions. 
 4K camcorder —A camcorder that shoots video at 4K resolutions.  
 Digital SLR —Interchangeable-lens still camera with a fixed or moving mirror inside. Most recent models 
can also shoot 720p or 1080p video.  
 Compact system camera —Interchangeable-lens still camera that uses an electronic viewfinder or LCD dis-
play rather than an optical prism viewfinder. Lighter and smaller than a digital SLR. Almost all models can 
also shoot 720p or 1080p video.  
 Digital camera —Fixed-lens still camera. Most late-model versions can also shoot 720p or 1080p video.  
 Action camcorder (also known as a sport camera or action camera) —An HD camcorder with an ultra 
wide-angle (120–180 degree viewing angle) lens. Action cameras are very light in weight, can be mounted 
to vehicles, helmets, or body harnesses, and are optimized for capturing fast action in a point-of-view 
mode.  
 Most action camcorders include support for Wi-Fi (standard or as an option) and can use a smartphone or a 
tablet to control the camera and show you what the camera lens sees.  
 Caution 
 The multimedia messaging 
standard (MMS) video setting 
available on some smart-
phones creates very blurry, 
very low-resolution videos 
that are suitable for use 
with messaging services. The 
resulting video is too poor 
quality to use in any other 
way. Refer to  Figure   21.2 .

 Improving Low Video Quality  
 In addition to resolution, the second factor affecting the sharpness of your video is the quality set-
ting. The quality setting controls the level of compression used to shoot video. On a camcorder, 
recording quality is usually expressed in terms of bandwidth: the higher the value, the better the 
quality. For example, on a Canon VIXIA camcorder, bandwidth options include the following:  
•  MXP— High quality, 24Mbps
•  FXP— High quality, 17Mbps
•  XP+— High quality, 12Mbps
•  SP— Standard play, 7Mbps
•  LP— Long play, 5Mbps
 As lower bandwidth (recording quality) selections are made, the amount of space needed to store 
the recording drops because less detail is stored in the video.  Figure   21.3 compares detail from a 
video recorded at MXP (24Mbps) quality versus LP (5Mbps) quality. The difference in detail and 
sharpness is obvious.  
 Note 
 The iOS Camera app is very limited in its features, so consider third-party apps for your iPhone, iPad, or iPod 
Touch. Apple is enabling developers to have more access to camera controls in iOS 8, so expect to see better 
camera/video apps for iOS devices after iOS 8 is released.

Video Quality Problems and Solutions
21
CHAPTER
 On a smartphone, tablet, or digital camera with video capability, different quality settings might be 
expressed in terms of bandwidth or as superfine, fine, and normal. Superfine provides the highest 
quality at a selected resolution, but uses more space than fine. Fine provides better quality than 
normal and uses more space than normal, but is lower quality and uses less space than superfine. 
Normal provides the lowest quality but uses the least space.  
 We recommend using the maximum quality setting for recording, particularly if you plan to show 
the recording on an HDTV or incorporate it into a video project. You can always reduce quality from 
a maximum-quality recording, but you can’t restore lost quality to a recording made at lower quality.  
 Choosing the Best Recording Speed  
 Recording speed is another important factor in video quality. Normal recording speeds of 24 or 30 
frames per second (fps) can be increased by some video recording apps and devices to 60fps or 
higher for slow-motion analysis or can be decreased below 24fps for special effects or to save space 
on the recording media.  
 With some devices, such as many action cameras, the recording quality and speed settings are 
grouped into combinations rather than being selected separately.

 Improving Color in Your Videos  
 Most camcorders and camcorder apps provide options for color adjustment, including white balance 
settings. However, some camera apps support white balance and 
exposure adjustments only in still-photo mode, not in camcorder 
mode. The default auto white balance setting can provide good 
results (varies by lighting and device quality), but for maximum 
quality under indoor or theater lighting, using the correct white 
balance preset provides better results. The adjustments (when 
present) are performed in the same way as white balance adjust-
ments on digital cameras.  
 Improving Exposure in Your Videos  
 Just as with digital cameras and camera apps, camcorders and 
camcorder apps can be fooled by differences between the lighting 
on the subject and the lighting of the foreground or background 
in view of the camera. Many, but not all, camcorders and apps 
also include exposure EV adjustments to help you shoot better 
video. 
 Image Blur Caused by Camera Shake  
 To help improve results when you’re shooting handheld video, 
many camcorders, camcorder apps, and digital cameras include 
video (image) stabilization features.  
 Image stabilization might be identified by a hand icon or a term 
such as vibration reduction (VR), optical stabilization (OS), image 
stabilization (IS), antishake, and so on.  
 Some cameras include two types of image stabilization: single-
shot is used for still photos, and dynamic is used for shooting 
videos.  Figure   21.5 illustrates these choices.  
 Note

Problems,” p.526, in 
 Chapter   20 , “Digital Camera 
Troubleshooting.” 
 Note 
 For details, see “Exposure 
Problems,” p.529, in

 Note 
 Digital SLR cameras may have

lenses or built in to the cam-
era body.  
 Note 
 For details, see “Camera 
Shake,” p.532, in  Chapter 
 20 , “Digital Camera 
Troubleshooting.”  
 Note 
 Use a tripod for maximum 
image stability. Be sure to 
turn off image stabilization if 
you use a tripod.  
 Tip 
 Dust, dirt, water, and fingerprints on a lens can have a big impact 
on video quality. Use a microfiber cloth and lens fluid (applied to 
the cloth, not directly to the lens) or pre-moistened lens tissue and 
a microfiber cloth to clean your device’s lens. Use the same method 
to clean the lens cover on an action camera.

CHAPTER
 Adding Additional Light  
 Some camcorders include a video light you can use in dim light. The light can help you focus or 
improve exposure.  Figure   21.6 illustrates a built-in video light.  
 If you shoot video with a digital SLR or compact system camera, many third-party vendors make 
camera video lights that can be attached to the camera’s accessory shoe, a light stand, or a tripod 
( see Figure   21.7  ). These typically use LED arrays and many are dimmable. Prices start at under 
$20 U.S.

 Caution 
 Most add-on video lights provide light that mimics daylight (5200–5600K). Some low-cost models recom-
mend that you use a filter over the light to improve the quality of the light. Using a filter reduces the effec-
tive amount of light the unit produces. Check reviews before purchasing.

CHAPTER
 Poor-Quality Sound  
 If you have problems with poor-quality audio recording (muffled audio, pops, wind noise, low vol-
ume, and so on) with your camcorder, digital camera, or app, you have a variety of options to help 
get better audio next time:  
•  Use an external microphone.
•  Adjust the microphone gain.
•  Use a wind shield.
•  Change the housing on an action camera.
 The next sections take a closer look at these solutions.  
 Using an External Microphone  
 If your camera or camcorder’s autofocus or other mechanisms are too loud in your videos, or your 
camera’s microphone is picking up your breathing instead of your subjects’ speaking, check your 
device’s specifications to see if you can connect an external microphone. An external microphone 
can connect via the stereo input mini-jack found on many camcorders and digital cameras with cam-
corder features (see  Figure   21.8 ) or a special accessory shoe found on some camcorders.

 A shotgun microphone points in the same direction as the camera to make it easier to pick up dis-
tant conversations ( see Figure   21.9 ), whereas a handheld or lapel microphone is good for interviews.  
 Adjusting Microphone Gain  
 The gain control is used to increase the volume of recorded audio. The default setting on cameras 
and camcorders is Auto. If the microphone is picking up too much ambient noise, set it to Manual 
and adjust the recording level. The Wind Filter setting, when available, reduces low-frequency 
noises such as wind.  Figure   21.10  shows typical Auto and Manual settings for audio on a digital SLR 
with camcorder capabilities.

CHAPTER
 Protecting Your Microphone from Wind Noise  
 A wind shield helps minimize wind noise during audio recording. 
As you saw in  Figure   21.9 , a foam wind shield is a common acces-
sory for shotgun microphones. Many other types of microphones 
also include wind shields, and they can be purchased separately.  
 You can create a low-cost, effective wind shield for a built-in micro-
phone by using a small piece of fake fur with hook-and-loop (Velcro 
or equivalent) material. By making the wind shield removable, you 
can replace it if anything happens to it.  
 Removing or Changing Housings on an Action Camera  
 Most action cameras include a water-resistant housing to protect the camera. However, the hous-
ing can interfere with the onboard microphone. If you don’t need to use the protective housing on 
an action camera, remove it. Some models of the GoPro HERO feature an interchangeable protective 
plate so you can optimize the device for greater water resistance or better audio recording.  
 Can’t Play or Edit Video  
 Digital video is usually stored in two formats: AVHCD and MP4. If you have problems playing back 
or editing your video, you can  
•  Install additional codecs to support your video type.
•  Convert to a different file format that is supported by your devices and playback software.
•  Install a compatible video editing program. You might have received one with your camcorder or
digital video device, but third-party products are widely available.
 Popular third-party titles include Adobe Premiere Elements (available alone or bundled with Adobe 
Photoshop Elements), Corel VideoStudio Pro, Microsoft Photo Gallery/Movie Maker, and Cyberlink 
PowerDirector.  
 Figure   21.11   illustrates Microsoft Movie Maker.

 Skipping Frames During Recording  
 Some camcorders and digital cameras with camcorder capability have built-in flash memory (older 
DV camcorders used tape). However, flash memory cards (typically SD, SDHC, or SDXC types) are 
used for primary or additional storage by most consumer camcorders and digital cameras with cam-
corder functionality.  
 If you have problems with skipping frames during recording to a flash memory card, the memory 
card is too slow for continuous recording. Some SD and all SDHC and SDXC cards are marked with a 
speed class rating. For shooting standard-definition video (720/640x480 resolution or lower), a card 
with a speed class rating of 2 is sufficient. For shooting 720p HD video, look for cards with a

 Can’t Make or Receive Phone Calls  
 Despite everything else it can do, an iPhone is primarily a cell phone. Problems with cell phone 
operation can be caused by the following:  
•  Incorrect phone configuration
•  Software updates needed
•  SIM card and carrier-related issues
 Use the solutions in the following sections to help.  
 iPhone Configuration Issues  
 If Do Not Disturb or Call Forwarding is enabled, you cannot receive phone calls. If Airplane Mode is 
enabled, you can’t make phone calls. Change these options through your iPhone’s Settings menu.  
 If you are expecting a call from a phone number that is blocked, you won’t be able to receive a call 
from that number until you unblock it. See  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5845 for details.  
 iPhone Updates  
 Check for iOS software updates. These can be made wirelessly or via iTunes. See  http://
support.apple.com/kb/ht4623  for details.  
 Cell phone carriers periodically issue updates you need to install. To check for updates, go to the 
Settings, General, About menus and install any update listed. See  http://support.apple.com/kb/
HT1970  for details.  
 Hardware- and Carrier-Related Issues  
 Make sure your phone’s SIM card is properly installed. To do so, remove and reseat it. Details vary 
by model, so see  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5163 for illustrations and details.  
 If you are unable to receive or make calls on a phone that supports multiple networks, disable one of 
the networks and see if you can make and receive calls on the other network.  
 Check with your carrier for outages or account issues.  

573
Wi-Fi Issues
22
CHAPTER
 iPhone 4/4s-Related Issues  
 On Verizon-network phones only, update the preferred roaming list (PRL). Dial *228 and select 
option 2. Your iPhone uses the PRL to identify the cell towers with the best signal. 
 If you have an iPhone 4 (not 4s) and have not received a free black iPhone 4 Bumper, contact 
AppleCare, an Apple Retail Store, or your local Apple provider. See  http://support.apple.com/kb/
HT4389  for contact information. The bumper prevents you from touching the antenna, which is built 
in to the outer shell of the phone. Third-party cases can also prevent you from touching the antenna.  
 If you’re not sure which model phone you have, look at the model number on the back of the phone. 
You can then do a web search for the model number for more information.  
 Can’t Connect to a Bluetooth Headset or 
Keyboard  
 Bluetooth headsets make hands-free operation of your iPhone or 
iPod Touch easy and wire-free, and Bluetooth keyboards provide a 
better typing environment for iPad users. If you are unable to con-
nect, check the following:  
•  Make sure the Bluetooth device’s battery is fully charged.
•  Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your iOS device.
•  Make sure your Bluetooth device will work with iOS.
 Wi-Fi Issues  
 If you’re worried about exceeding the data allowance for your iPhone or cellular-equipped iPad, 
Wi-Fi is an excellent alternative to using your cellular network.  
 If you are unable to connect to a Wi-Fi network, assuming that a Wi-Fi network is available, check 
the following:  
•  Make sure Wi-Fi is enabled. If you have enabled Airplane Mode, Wi-Fi, cellular, and
Bluetooth connections are disabled. See “Airplane Mode Versus Wi-Fi Mode”  in Chapter   3 ,
“Troubleshooting Internet Problems,” for details.
•  Make sure you know the SSID and encryption key (if necessary) to make the connection.
•  If you can choose from multiple SSIDs (as in a hotel, conference center, or large building), use the
SSID with the strongest signal.
•  As you travel throughout an area using Wi-Fi, it might be necessary to switch to a different SSID
with a stronger signal.
•  If your device doesn’t automatically switch from Wi-Fi to cellular data when the Wi-Fi signal is
too weak to use, disable Wi-Fi. This also has the benefit of improving battery life. See “Switching
Connection Types Manually” in  Chapter   3 for details.
 Note 
 For more information about 
troubleshooting Bluetooth 
connections on iOS, see 
“Bluetooth Keyboard (iOS),” 
and “Troubleshooting 
Problems with Bluetooth 
Devices,” both in  Chapter 
 17 , “Troubleshooting

Mice.” 

iOS Troubleshooting
574
•  If you cannot connect in all parts of your home or office, install signal repeaters or replace routers
with more antennas. See “Installing and Using a Signal Repeater” in  Chapter   3 for details.
 4G Issues  
 Your iPhone or iPad’s connection to a 4G network can be affected by many of the same issues that 
prevent making or receiving phone calls because both telephone and data connections use the cell 
phone carriers’ networks. If you can’t get a reliable connection, 
check the following:  
•  Make sure Airplane Mode is not enabled.
•  Make sure that iOS and carrier service updates are installed.
•  Remove and reinstall your device’s SIM card.
•  Check with your carrier for outages or account issues.
 FaceTime Issues  
 FaceTime, which enables voice and video chatting in real-time, can be affected by iOS update 
issues, device certificate issues, device configuration issues, network issues, and cellular provider 
limitations. Here’s how to keep it working for you:  
•  Use a Wi-Fi network instead of a cellular network when possible. Although cellular providers
in the United States and Canada now support FaceTime over their networks, heavy FaceTime
usage could use up smaller data plans.
•  To enable FaceTime over cellular, use Settings, Cellular and select Use Cellular Data for
FaceTime by moving the slider next to FaceTime (see  Figure   22.1 ).
•  Make sure both ends of the connection are using devices with the latest iOS updates.
•  Make sure date and time are being set automatically on both ends of the connection (use
Settings, General, Date & Time to verify or change time settings).
•  If either or both ends of the connection are using Wi-Fi and a firewall program or appliance,
make sure the firewall is configured to permit FaceTime traffic. See  http://support.apple.com/kb/
HT4245  for details.
•  If you make changes to your device’s configuration, turn it off and back on again.
 For more information, see  http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3367 .  
 If you want to use FaceTime or other apps on a cellular network, or block them from running when 
you connect via cellular, here’s how:  
1.  Open  Settings .
2.  Tap  Cellular .

 To use a printer with your iOS device, you must have a printer that supports wireless printing, 
the appropriate client program for your device, and a working network connection. For details, see 
“Troubleshooting iOS and Android Printer Support” in  Chapter   11 . 
 Dealing with an Overheated iOS Device  
 If your iOS device is overheating, that’s not good for the device nor for its battery. To learn 
some simple ways to help prevent overheating and to deal with an overheated device, see 
“Troubleshooting iOS and Android Device Overheating” in  Chapter   16  , “Keeping Devices Cool.”  
 Troubleshooting iOS Charging Issues  
 The easiest way to charge your iOS device is to use the original adapter and charging cable. 
However, you might prefer to use your PC’s USB ports as an alternative, or you might need to use a 
different adapter than the one provided with your device if that one stops working.  
 For details, see “Smartphone Versus Tablet—Charging Requirements” in  Chapter   6 , “Keeping 
Devices Powered Up.”  
 Can’t View Files on a Wireless Drive  
 Your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad has limited onboard storage space and no expansion slots. 
However, by using wireless drives from vendors such as Seagate and SanDisk, you can access docu-
ments and media files via Wi-Fi.  
 If you are having problems connecting or using a wireless drive, see “File Sharing with Portable 
Devices” in  Chapter   9 , “Solving File Sharing Problems.”  
 Can’t Play or Sync Media  
 Your iOS device can use direct USB or mini-jack connections, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or Apple TV to play 
media on your home theater system.  
 If you are having problems playing music, see “I Want to Play Music on My iOS Device Through My 
Receiver” in  Chapter   12 , “Troubleshooting Home Theater, HDTVs, and Projectors.”  
 If you are having problems playing a movie, see “I Want to Play a Movie on My iOS Device Through 
My Receiver” in  Chapter   12 . 
 If you are having problems syncing your existing music files to an iOS device, see “Troubleshooting 
Syncing to an iOS Device” in  Chapter   12 .

CHAPTER
 Updating Your iOS Device or Apps  
 One of the first steps recommended by Apple for most iOS problems is updating your device. You 
can update via Wi-Fi (default setting) or via your cellular network. For details, see “Updating iOS 
Devices” in  Chapter   14  , “Keeping Your Devices Updated.”  
 Running Short of Space on Your iOS 
Device 
 Unlike Android devices, which usually feature Micro SD expansion slots, Apple’s iOS devices have 
no expandable storage. So, sooner or later, you might run out of space and need to houseclean your 
device to make room for a must-have app or go-anywhere content.  
 To learn what’s chewing up your capacity and how to give your device some free space, see 
“Freeing Up Storage Space on Your iOS Device” in  Chapter   18 , “Upgrading and Troubleshooting 
Storage Devices.”  
 Stopping Malware in its Tracks  
 Although Windows-based devices are the most common target for malware attacks, iOS devices 
need protection, even if for no other reason than to prevent their being used as a means of infection 
for other devices they connect to.  
 To learn more about anti-malware apps you can use on your iOS device, see “Preventing and 
Removing Malware on iOS Devices” in  Chapter   4 , “Curing Malware and Stopping Scams.”  
 To learn more about third-party browsers that can help protect your system from scams and threats, 
see “Google Chrome” in  Chapter   4 . 
 Troubleshooting an iOS Device That Stops 
Responding  
 If an iOS device won’t respond when you press the Home button, won’t sleep, or is slow to respond 
to your commands, it’s time to take action. To solve problems with an unresponsive device, you can 
restart it or reset it. Neither of these actions does anything to your information, so they’re safe to 
use. 
 Restarting an iOS Device  
 To restart your device, follow these steps:  
1.  Press and hold down the Sleep/Wake button on the top of the device.
2.  When the Slide to Power slider appears, use it to turn off your device.
3.  Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button again to restart the device.

578
 Resetting an iOS Device  
 If you are unable to restart your device, you need to perform a hard reset:  
1.  Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button for at least 10 seconds.
2.  Release both buttons when the Apple logo appears.
 Resetting iOS Settings to Defaults  
 Problems with network connections, the custom dictionary, the home screen layout, and location 
and privacy settings can be solved by resetting these options to their defaults. Here’s how:  
1.  Open  Settings .
2.  Tap  General, and then scroll down and tap  Reset .
3.  Choose a reset option. To reset the network, dictionary, home screen layout, and location and pri-
vacy settings, tap  Reset All Settings . Or you can choose what to reset ( see Figure   22.2 ).

CHAPTER
 Troubleshooting an iOS Device That Can’t 
Start  
 If you can’t turn on your iOS device, check the following:  
 Make sure your charger and charging cable are working. Whether you use an original Apple charg-
ing cable or one of the innumerable third-party versions, charging cables often fail. Swap cables, 
plug in your device for at least 20 minutes, and see if it comes on. If it does, your cable was to 
blame. 
 If changing cables makes no difference, try connecting your device 
to a USB port on your computer. A standard USB 2.0 port puts out 
500mA, which is enough to charge your iPhone or iPod Touch. If 
the charge indicator (a lightning bolt through the battery indicator) 
comes on when the device is plugged into a USB port, but not your 
charger, it’s time to replace your charger.  
 For a step-by-step troubleshooting process, see “Smartphone or 
Tablet Cable or Charger?” in  Chapter   6 . 
 If you want to charge your iPad with your computer, you will need to enable your computer’s USB 
ports to output more amperage than normal. For details, see “Setting Up Your PC’s USB Ports for 
Full-Time Charging Support” in  Chapter   6 . 
 Backing Up Your iOS Device  
 The best way to protect from future problems with your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch is to use iTunes 
to back it up. By doing so, you make it possible to restore your system in case you need to reset it. 
Here’s how.  
1.  Connect your iOS device to your PC via its USB/charging cable.
2.  Start iTunes on your PC.
3.  Select your device from the Devices category in the left pane.
4.  Tap  Summary .
5.  Tap  This Computer  in the Backups section of the Summary tab.
 Caution 
 You will lose the current settings for whatever you reset. For example, if you reset your network settings, 
you will need to reenter any wireless encryption keys or hidden SSIDs the next time you want to use those 
networks.  
 The Erase All Contents and Settings button is also in this menu. It should be used only if you are preparing 
a device for service, if you need to restore the device from a backup for troubleshooting, or if you are plan-
ning to stop using the device. Don’t use this option unless you have backed up your device first!  
 Note 
 To see the recommended 
charging amperage for your 
device, see “Smartphone 
Versus Tablet—Charging 
Requirements” in  Chapter   6 .

6.  To start the backup, tap  Back Up Now  ( see Figure   22.3  ).
7.  If prompted to back up apps that are not in your iTunes library, tap  Back Up Apps.
8.  The backup process runs. At the end of the process, the Latest Backup section of the Summary
tab lists the date of the backup.
 Erasing All Contents and Settings  
 If your iOS device stops working, the backup process we described in the previous section becomes 
very important. Having a recent backup means that you can erase all content and settings from your 
device and restore them.

CHAPTER
 The erasing process (without restoring the backup) is also how you prepare an iOS device you no 
longer plan to keep. Whether you’re giving it away, selling it, or recycling it, you don’t want your 
information on it. Here’s how to clean it up.  
1.  Open  Settings .
2.  Tap  General .
3.  Tap  Reset.
4.  Tap  Erase All Contents and Settings  (refer to  Figure   22.2 ).
5.  If you use a passcode, enter it when prompted.
6.  Tap  Erase twice when prompted.
7.  Enter your Apple ID password and tap  Erase .
8.  The Apple icon with a progress indicator is displayed during the
erasure process.
9.  When the Apple icon disappears, the process is complete. The
device is ready for a new user or to have its contents restored
from an iTunes backup.
 Restoring from a Backup  
 If you use Erase All Files and Settings to reset your iOS device to solve problems, you can use your 
iTunes backup to restore its contents. You can also move your apps and data from an old iOS device 
to a new one. Here’s how:  
1.  Connect your device to your PC with the charging cable.
2.  Start iTunes.
3.  Click your device.
4.  On the Welcome to Your New (device) dialog, select  Restore from This Backup .
5.  Click or tap  Continue  to restore from your latest backup ( see
Figure   22.4  ).
6.  The restore process begins. A progress bar appears along with
an estimate of the remaining time for each step.
7.  At the end of the restore process, the progress bar disappears.
Close iTunes, and your device is ready to use.
 If some of your apps are not restored, you can install them manually 
from iTunes or download them again from the iTunes store.  
 Note 
 For more information about 
using Erase All Contents and 
Settings, see  http://support.
apple.com/kb/HT2110 . 
 Note 
 You might hear a chime 
coming from your device dur-
ing the restore process. The 
chime repeats periodically 
until you set up the passcode 
on your device. Go to the 
device and enter a passcode. 
Confirm it when prompted.

582
 Resetting Your Device to Like-New 
Condition  
 After you use Erase All Files and Settings, you can use iTunes to set up your device as new. Select 
 Set Up as New (Device)  from the Welcome to Your New (device) dialog shown in  Figure   22.4 . 
 Restarting Your Device in Recovery Mode  
 Use Recovery Mode if your device is not recognized by iTunes, if iTunes reports that your device is 
in Recovery Mode, if the Apple logo does not have a progress bar, or if your device tells you to con-
nect to iTunes.  
 Recovery Mode performs two tasks: it erases your device (similar to Erase All Files and Settings) 
and restores your device to like-new condition. You can then restore your latest iTunes or iCloud 
backup to it.

 Can’t Make or Receive Phone Calls  
 Android smartphones depend on the com.Android.Phone process for making telephone calls and 
connecting to 4G cellular data services. If you see this error message: Process com.Android.Phone 
Has Stopped Unexpectedly, follow these steps until you reach a solution: 
1.  If you see this error after installing a new app or installing an app update, uninstall the app. If
the error no longer occurs, don’t reinstall the app until an updated version is available.
2.  Check for an update for your phone. The update might come from the vendor’s website or be
listed in Settings.
3.  If an update is available, install it. If the error reappears, go to step 4.
4.  If no app was installed or updated, and if no phone updates are available, check the battery. If
the battery won’t hold a charge, replace it.
5.  If the problem recurs, power down your smartphone.
6.  Remove its battery.
7.  Remove its microSD card.
8.  Remove its SIM card.
9.  Wait a minute or two, reinstall the battery, microSD card, and
SIM card and power it back up again.
10.  If the error message occurs again, perform a factory reset (see
“Performing a Factory Reset/Restore” later in this chapter
page 590). If the problem persists, the phone needs to be ser-
viced.
 Can’t Connect to a Bluetooth Device  
 Bluetooth headsets make hands-free operation of your Android smartphone easy and wire free, and 
Bluetooth keyboards and mice provide a better input environment for Android tablet users. If you 
are unable to connect, check the following:  
•  Make sure the Bluetooth device’s battery is fully charged.
•  Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your Android device.
•  Make sure your Bluetooth device will work with Android.
 Tip 
 The androidforums.com web-
site is an excellent resource 
for Android troubleshooting.

CHAPTER
 Wi-Fi Issues  
 If you’re worried about exceeding the data allowance for your Android smartphone or cellular-
equipped Android tablet, Wi-Fi is an excellent alternative to using your cellular network.  
 If you are unable to connect to a Wi-Fi network, assuming one is available, check the following:  
•  Make sure Wi-Fi is enabled. If you have enabled Airplane Mode, Wi-Fi and cellular and Bluetooth
connections are disabled. See “Airplane Mode Versus Wi-Fi Mode,”  Chapter   3 , “Troubleshooting
Internet Problems,” for details.
•  Make sure you know the SSID and encryption key (if necessary) to make the connection.
•  If you can choose from multiple SSIDs (as in a hotel, conference center, or large building), use the
SSID with the strongest signal. An app such as the free Wi-Fi Analyzer can help you choose the
best SSID. To learn more about using Wi-Fi Analyzer, see “Solving Signal Strength Problems,” in
 Chapter   3 , “Troubleshooting Internet Problems.”
•  As you travel throughout an area using Wi-Fi, it might be necessary to switch to a different SSID
with a stronger signal.
•  If your device doesn’t automatically switch from Wi-Fi to cellular data when the Wi-Fi signal is
too weak to use, disable Wi-Fi. This also has the benefit of improving battery life. See “Switching
Connection Types Manually,”  Chapter   3 , for details.
•  If you cannot connect in all parts of your home or office, install signal repeaters or replace routers
with more antennas. See “Installing and Using a Signal Repeater,”  Chapter   3 , for details.
 Can’t Print from Your Android Device  
 To use a printer with your Android device, you must have a printer that supports wireless printing, 
the appropriate client program for your device, and a working network connection. For details, see 
“Troubleshooting iOS and Android Printer Support” in  Chapter   11, “Troubleshooting Printing  .”  
 Dealing with an Overheated Android 
Device 
 If your Android device is overheating, that’s not good for the device or its battery. To learn 
some simple ways to help prevent overheating and to deal with an overheated device, see 
“Troubleshooting iOS and Android Device Overheating” in  Chapter   16  , “Keeping Devices Cool.”  
 Troubleshooting Android Charging Issues  
 If your Android device is charging slowly or won’t charge at all, the problem could be caused by a 
faulty charger, charging cable, or using a connection that doesn’t provide enough amperage for the 
device’s power requirements.  

Android Troubleshooting
588
 To see the recommended charging amperage for your device, see “Smartphone Versus Tablet—
Charging Requirements,” in  Chapter   6 . To determine whether the charging cable or charger is at 
fault, see “Smartphone or Tablet Cable or Charger?” in  Chapter   6, “Keeping Devices Powered Up  .” 
 Can’t View Files on a Wireless Drive  
 Most Android devices have Micro-SD expansion slots and a few have USB ports. However, you can 
access large amounts of information wirelessly, and by using wireless drives from vendors such as 
Seagate and SanDisk you can access documents and media files via Wi-Fi.  
 If you are having problems connecting or using a wireless drive, see “File Sharing with Portable 
Devices,” in  Chapter   9 , “Solving File Sharing Problems.”  
 Can’t Play or Sync Media  
 Your Android device can use direct USB or mini-jack connections, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or streaming 
media devices to play media on your home theater system.  
 If you are having problems playing music, see “I Want to Play Music on My Android Device Through 
a Home Theater System” in  Chapter   12 , “Troubleshooting Home Theater, HDTVs, and Projectors.”  
 If you are having problems playing a movie, see “I Want to Play a Movie on My Android Device 
Through a Home Theater System” in  Chapter   12 . 
 If you are having problems syncing your existing media, see “Troubleshooting Syncing to an 
Android Device” in  Chapter   12 . 
 Updating Your Android Device or Apps  
 Want to solve problems with your Android device? Want better-behaved Android apps? 
Understanding how to keep your Android device and apps updated is a big part of the answer. You 
can update via Wi-Fi or via your cellular network. For details, see “Updating Android Devices” in 
 Chapter   14 , “Keeping Your Devices Updated.”  
 Running Short of Space on Your Android 
Device 
 Unlike iOS devices, most Android devices have expandable storage, thanks to Micro SD card slots. 
However, your device won’t use the card automatically: you need to specify which apps can be 
stored there and what types of files the card can use. To learn how, see “Freeing Up Storage Space 
on Your Android Device” in  Chapter   18 , “Upgrading and Troubleshooting Storage Devices.” 
 Preventing Malware Attacks  
 Android devices are common enough that they’ve become popular malware targets, and part of the 
problem is that the Google Play store doesn’t do a good enough job of stopping infected apps from

malware app features to look for, see “Preventing and Removing Malware on Android Devices” in 
 Chapter   4 , “Curing Malware and Stopping Scams.”  
 Backing Up Your Android Device’s Data  
 Google’s automatic backup does not back up everything on your Android device (see  
http://www.howtogeek.com/140376/htg-explains-what-android-data-is-backed-up-automatically/ ) for 
a list of what Google does, and does not, back up automatically. If you use non-Google email 
services and contacts and other content not listed as being backed up by Google’s automatic 
backup, use an additional backup program. Many free and low-cost backup programs are available 
from Google Play. Some device vendors also offer their own backup utilities, such as Samsung’s Kies 
and Kies 3.  
 If you decide to use a third-party backup program, be sure to install and use it to make a backup 
before performing a factory reset.  
 When using a backup program, be sure to select all items to back up on both your device’s built-in 
storage and the device’s micro-SD card (if installed),

 Performing a Factory Reset/Restore  
 A factory reset returns your Android device to “out of the box” condition. It deletes all user data and 
settings. However, the version of Android running on your device remains the same as it was before 
the factory reset.  
 Use a factory reset as a last resort before servicing a device or when you’re ready to sell, give away, 
or scrap your device.  
 Here’s how to perform a factory reset from the Android Settings menu:  
1.  Run your preferred third-party backup app (refer to  Figure   23.1 ), selecting all items for backup.
2.  Open  Settings .
3.  Navigate to Backup Options, Backup and Reset (recent Android versions) or Privacy, Backup and
Reset (older Android versions).
4.  If you want to restore your information after running Factory Reset, make sure that  Back Up My
Data  and  Automatic Restore  are checked.
5.  Make sure you have the password for the Backup Account email address listed.
6.  Tap  Factory Data Reset  to continue.
7.  Scroll down to the bottom of the accounts list.
8.  Tap the SD Card box if you want to format your card.

 Troubleshooting Methodology  
 If you don’t service technology devices for a living, it might seem scary 
to talk about the troubleshooting process. But, believe me, it’s worth the 
effort to follow a process that can find problems in a hurry, whether you 
earn your living at it or just want to save a few bucks and be the hero of 
your office or home.  
 To become a successful troubleshooter, you need to:  
•  Learn as much as you can about what went wrong.
•  Evaluate the environment where the computer problem took place.
•  Use testing and reporting software to gather information about the sys-
tem.
•  Form a hypothesis about the nature of the problem and how to resolve
it (a theory you will try to prove or disprove).
•  Use the troubleshooting cycle to isolate and solve the problem.
 The First Step—Finding Out What 
Happened  
 Whether you’re troubleshooting your own computers or helping out a co-
worker, a friend, your spouse, your kids, or your parents with a computer 
problem, the first task is to find out  what happened.  Unless you know 
what was happening when the problem first showed up, you’re going to 
have a very hard time finding and solving the problem.  

Troubleshooting Flowcharts
594
 Here’s what you need to find out—or remember:  
•  What software was being used?
•  What hardware was being used?
•  What error messages were displayed?
•  What was the computer user working on?
•  What type of environment (electrical and otherwise) was in the work area at the time of the
problem?
 Using the preceding questions, you want to find the answer to this question: “What changed since 
the last time it worked?” Let’s look at the first question from the list: What software was being 
used? You want to find out the following:  
•  The name of the program and the version— Restart the program and click Help, About to see
this information.
•  The operating system— Open the Windows Device Manager or the Settings menu on a mobile
device to see this information.
•  Any other programs that were also in use at the time.
 The second question, What hardware was being used? should reveal what add-on hardware 
(printer, scanner, DVD burner, network) was in use.  
 The third question is simple: What error messages were displayed? You might need to try to repro-
duce the problem to display a complex error message such as a Blue Screen of Death.  
 The fourth question, What was the user working on? is designed to determine the specifics of the 
task. For example, trying to print a multipage document with lots of graphics to a laser printer is 
a different task than printing a single-page letter to the same printer or to a different printer. You 
should also find out what programs the user was running because some programs might conflict 
with others running at the same time.  
 Sometimes, after you learn the answers to these questions, the solution to the problem will jump out 
at you. But sometimes, you’ll need to look around your computer space (if it’s your problem) or go to 
the problem’s central location, put on your deerstalker cap, and play detective.  
 How to Check Out the Computing Environment  
 Even if you’re trying to solve a problem with your own computer, and especially if you’re assist-
ing somebody else, you need to find out some facts about the environment where the computer is 
located. 
 What kinds of information are you looking for? Use  Table   24.1 to provide a quick checklist of what to 
take with you or what you’ll need access to, depending on what you learned from your initial ques-
tions.

 System information  
 Which test or diagnostic routine is the best one to start with? Before you perform any specific 
tests, review the clues you got asking the initial questions. For example, if you found out that you 
could print simple documents to a laser printer with Microsoft Word, but you had problems printing 
graphics-rich publications with Adobe Reader, the problem isn’t with Windows (which controls the 
printer), and probably not with the printer, but it could be with the documents themselves. To learn 
more about the printer, you should use the printer’s self-test.  
 A laser printer’s self-test usually indicates the amount of RAM onboard, emulation (HP or 
PostScript), and firmware revisions. The amount of RAM onboard is critical because laser printers 
are page printers: The whole page must fit into the laser printer’s RAM to be printed. 
 Thus, there are two variables to this printing problem: the amount of RAM in the printer and the 
size of the document. If, for example, the self-test reveals the printer has only the standard amount 
of RAM onboard, then it’s adequate for text, but an elaborate page can overload it. If a look at the 
document reveals that it has a large amount of graphic content, you’re likely to have problems.  
 There are two easy solutions to this type of problem:  
•  Add more memory to the printer.
•  Reduce the graphics resolution.
 It’s easier (and cheaper!) to reduce the graphics resolution to see whether the documents will print. 
If this works, you can check with a memory vendor for a printer memory upgrade if you need the full 
graphics quality or print documents using reduced resolution.  
 On the other hand, if the problem you’re experiencing centers around the computer locking up 
frequently (and randomly), you’d want to check the electrical power. The first step here is to see 
whether the power the computer uses is good. A low-cost wall outlet analyzer is a useful tool. This 
device has signal lights indicating whether the wiring is correct or if faults exist with grounding, 
reversed polarity, and the like. Random lockups, crashes, and other types of mysterious computer 
problems can be traced to bad power. If the problem happens only after the computer’s been on for 
a while,  it’s time to look at the computer’s hardware monitor to check the internal temperature or 
voltage settings. They system could be overheating.  
 Conversely, if the system locks up only when you’re using a specific application, it’s more than likely 
that the problem is with the application and not your computer. In that case you should check the 
application vendor’s website to see whether it’s a common problem and if a patch is available to 
fix it.

 If you think that you might need to reinstall or repair Windows, you’ll need:  
•  The original operating system disc  or
•  A repair disc for that version of Windows
 For solving problems with mobile devices, you should also have:  
•  A microSD card for making backups
•  Tools for opening iOS devices and removing their SIM cards
 Use these tools to help you perform the steps you need to follow during the troubleshooting cycle.  
 The Troubleshooting Cycle  
 The troubleshooting cycle is a method that you can use to determine exactly what part of a complex 
system, such as a computer, is causing the problem.  
 The first step, as we’ve seen previously, is to determine the most likely source of the problem. The 
questions you ask the user (or yourself) will help determine which subsystem is the best place to 
start in solving the problem. In the previous example, the printing subsystem was the most likely 
place to start.  
 To help you focus on the likely cause for a computer problem, use the Symptoms Table at the begin-
ning of each chapter to look up the most likely solutions for the symptoms of the computer problem. 
Follow the recommendations, and you’re on the road to the solution.  
 Sometimes, you might discover that a particular symptom seems ambiguous: it points to more than 
one possible solution. In cases like this, it’s helpful to realize that any computer is a collection of 
subsystems. What’s a subsystem?  
 A subsystem is the combination of components designed to effect a particular task, and it can 
include both hardware and software components. Use  Table   24.2 to better understand the nature of 
the subsystems found in any computer.

 You can see from this list that virtually every subsystem in the computer has hardware, software, 
and firmware components. A thorough troubleshooting process will take into account both the sub-
system and all its components.  
 As you use the Symptoms Table in each chapter and the flowcharts, keep the subsystems inside 
your computer in mind. The flowcharts and chapter write-ups are designed to cover the different 
components of each subsystem. However, in some cases, you might need to check more than one 
subsystem to find the solutions you’re looking for.

CHAPTER
 Testing a Subsystem  
 Whether you troubleshoot to save money or to make money, and whether you’re operating on your 
own computer or a friend’s, you should take the computer user’s version of the Hippocratic oath: 
“First, do no harm (to the computer).”  
 Before you change anything, record the current configuration. Depending on the item, this may 
include one or more of the following:  
•  Recording jumper or cable settings on the motherboard or an add-in card
•  Printing the complete report from the Windows Device Manager
•  Printing a complete report from a third-party diagnostic or reporting program such as SiSoftware
Sandra
•  Recording device settings on a tablet or smartphone
•  Recording BIOS configurations
 Use a digital camera to make this easier.  
 After you have recorded the configuration you are going to change, follow this procedure:  
1.  Change one hardware component or hardware/software/firmware setting at a time.
2.  Try the task the user was performing after a single change, and evaluate the results.
3.  If the same or similar problem reoccurs, reinstall the original component or reset the software to
the original settings and continue with the next item.
4.  Repeat until the subsystem performs normally. The last item changed is the problem; repair,
replace, or reload it as appropriate to solve the problem.
  Best Sources for Replacement Parts  
 To perform parts exchanges for troubleshooting, you need replacement parts. Use known-working 
parts from a spare system to save money and to avoid problems with brand-new, out-of-the-box 
defective parts.  
 Where to Start?  
 As the preceding subsystem list indicates, there’s no shortage of places to start in virtually any sub-
system. What’s the best way to decide whether a hardware, software, or firmware problem is the 
most likely cause?  
 Typically, hardware problems come and go, and software and firmware problems are consistent. 
Why? A hardware problem is often the result of a damaged or loose wire or connection; when the 
connection is closed, the component works, but when the connection opens, the component fails.  
 On the other hand, a software or firmware problem will cause a failure under the same circum-
stances every time.

 Another general rule that’s useful is known as Occam’s Razor, or the least hypothesis. English 
Philosopher William of Occam suggested centuries ago that the simplest (or least complex) explana-
tion that fits the known facts is usually the accurate one. While TV shows such as the late, lamented 
 X-Files are enjoyable to watch, their “trust no one” paranoia and incredibly complicated explana-
tions for everything are exactly the wrong approach to take when you’re trying to fix a computer
problem. Instead, look at the least-expensive, easiest-to-replace item first. In most cases, the cable
connected to a subsystem is the first place to  look for problems. Whether the cable is internal or
external, it is almost always the least-expensive part of the subsystem, can easily come loose, and
can easily be damaged.
 If a cable is loose; has bent pins; or has a dry, brittle, or cracked exterior, replace it. Although it may 
sound overly simplistic, good cables usually look good and bad cables often look bad.  
 When new software or new hardware has been introduced to the system and a problem results 
immediately afterward, that change is often the most likely cause of the problem.  
 To confirm whether new hardware or software is at the root of a PC problem, you should remove it 
and reboot your PC. If all functions normally again, you have your answer (or at least part of it). The 
System Restore feature is a very useful tool for determining if the software or hardware you added is 
at fault; it automates the process of returning your computer to a previous condition before a given 
software or hardware installation.  
 Where to Go for More Information  
 After you’ve gathered as much information as possible, you may find that you still need more help. 
User manuals for components often are discarded, software drivers need to be updated, and some 
conflicts don’t have easy answers. There’s one “place” to go to find the information you need: the 
World Wide Web. Fire up your browser and check out the websites suggested in this book, use 
search engines such as Google ( www.google.com ) to search for solutions, and also try these: the 
manufacturers’ websites; CNet’s  http://download.com.com (for drivers); and online computer maga-
zines such as PCMagazine ( www.pcmag.com ), PCWorld ( www.pcworld.com ), and others.  
 Keeping Track of Your Solutions  
 If you hate solving the same problems over and over again (and who wouldn’t?), keep detailed notes 
about the problems you solve. Be sure to note symptoms, underlying problems, workarounds, and 
final resolutions. Use the copy and paste feature in Windows to store website URLs, and use File, 
Save as Web Archive in Internet Explorer to save useful web pages and their graphics in the docu-
ments you write up.

 Summarizing the Troubleshooter’s 
Philosophy  
 The troubleshooter’s philosophy can be summarized this way:  
•  Discover what really was happening when trouble happened.
•  Find out what changed.
•  Use the troubleshooting cycle to reproduce the problem and discover a solution.
•  Record the solution in case you need it again.
 Use this philosophy and this book to become a troubleshooting hero to your family, friends, and co-
workers.
