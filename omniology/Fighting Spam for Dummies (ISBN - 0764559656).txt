About the Authors
John R. Levine was a member of a computer club in high
school — before high school students, or even high schools,
had computers — where he met Theodor H. Nelson, the
author of Computer Lib/Dream Machines and the inventor of
hypertext, who reminded us that computers should not be
taken seriously and that everyone can and should understand
and use computers.
John wrote his first program in 1967 on an IBM 1130 (a com-
puter somewhat less powerful than your typical modern digi-
tal wristwatch, only more difficult to use). He became an
official system administrator of a networked computer at Yale
in 1975. He began working part-time, for a computer company,
of course, in 1977 and has been in and out of the computer
and network biz ever since. Since he has been on the Internet
for a long time, he started getting spammed early and often,
leading to his joining the board of the Coalition Against
Unsolicited Commercial E-mail (CAUCE) and starting the
Network Abuse Clearinghouse (www.abuse.net).
Although John used to spend most of his time writing soft-
ware, now he mostly writes books (including The Internet For
Dummies and Internet Secrets, both published by Wiley
Publishing, Inc.) because it’s more fun and he can do so at
home in the tiny village of Trumansburg, New York, where he
is the sewer commissioner (Guided tours! Free samples!) and
can play with his small daughter when he’s supposed to be
writing. John also does a fair amount of public speaking. (See
www.iecc.com/johnl to see where he’ll be.) He holds a B.A.
and a Ph.D. in computer science from Yale University, but
please don’t hold that against him.
Margaret Levine Young was a member of the same high-
school computer club as John (probably because she was his
little sister at the time). She stayed in the field throughout col-
lege against her better judgment and despite John’s presence
as a graduate student in the computer science department.
Margy graduated from Yale and went on to become one of the
first PC managers in the early 1980s at Columbia Pictures,
where she rode the elevator with big stars whose names she
wouldn’t dream of dropping here.

Since then, Margy has coauthored more than 25 books about
the Internet, Unix, Microsoft Access, online communities,
WordPerfect, and (stab from the past) PC-File and Javelin,
including The Internet For Dummies and Access 2003 All-in-One
Desk Reference For Dummies (published by Wiley Publishing,
Inc.) and Windows XP Home Edition: The Complete Reference
and Internet: The Complete Reference (published by Osborne/
McGraw-Hill). She met her future husband, Jordan, in the
R.E.S.I.S.T.O.R.S. (that computer club we mentioned). Her
other passions are her children, Unitarian Universalism
(www.uua.org), and cooking. She lives in Vermont (see
www.gurus.com/margy).
Ray Everett-Church published his first article about 
computers — and about the mischief one could cause with
them — in a community newspaper in Nashville, Tennessee,
back in 1983. Nobody has been able to shut him up since.
In 1999, he became the world’s first corporate chief privacy
officer, and has spent much of his career since then teaching
Fortune 500 firms how to respect consumer privacy and
avoid being labeled as spammers.
He received degrees from George Mason University and the
George Washington University Law School. During law school,
he supported himself by working as an antispam consultant
to an upstart online service named America Online. He trains
dozens of privacy professionals each year in executive semi-
nars and lectures, and has testified before Congress and the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission on the issues of junk e-mail
and online marketing.
Ray now works as chief privacy officer for the privacy
and antispam technology company ePrivacy Group
(www.eprivacygroup.com), where he heads its consulting
division. He lives a stone’s throw from Silicon Valley, in
always lovely northern California, with his very patient part-
ner, Justin, and two rather strange-looking cats. You can learn
more about Ray at www.everett.org.

Dedication
John dedicates his part of the book to Tonia and Sarah, again
and forever. Margy dedicates her part to Jordan, Meg, and
Zac, as always. Ray dedicates his part to his Mom and Dad,
and to Justin.

Introduction
S
pam — unsolicited bulk and commercial e-mail — may
be killing e-mail. Spam is causing people to cancel their
Internet accounts (or at least stop reading their e-mail)
because e-mail has become an unpleasant waste of time. 
E-mail has also become unreliable because spam filters 
sometimes accidentally throw away good messages with
the spam. Spam wastes thousands of hours of your time,
as you skim Subject lines and press the Delete key, trying
to guess which messages aren’t even worth opening.
Luckily, you can do something about spam, on both the small
scale and the grand scale. On the small scale, you can use spam
filters to junk most of the spam that’s addressed to you, and
you can report spam to network managers. On the grand
scale, you can lobby for effective antispam laws to make it
possible to sue the rip-off artists who fill your inboxes that
you pay for with their advertising.
You have probably figured out that we have some strong 
feelings about spam! If you have bought or borrowed this
book, you probably have strong feelings too.
This book talks about how you can get rid of most or all of
the spam in your mailbox. We also cover where spam comes
from, how it came about, whom to report it to, and whether
antispam laws would be effective. We can assure you that
after reading this book, you will know how to have an almost
spam-free Internet experience — how’s that for good news?

What’s in This Book
This book is divided into four parts so that you can find what
you want quickly:
 Part I, “The World of Spam,” describes what spam is, how
it works, how spammers get your address, how antispam
laws may and should work, and how to complain about
spam you receive.
 Part II, “Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox,” tells you how
to create folders and filters in your e-mail program to
move spam from your inbox either into another folder
or directly into the trash. We describe Outlook Express,
Outlook, Netscape Mail, Mozilla Mail, Eudora, AOL, MSN,
Hotmail, and Yahoo! Mail. The latest versions of some of
these programs already contain powerful spam-filtering
features, and we explain how to use them.
 Part III, “Spam-Filtering Programs and Services,” looks at
spam-filtering programs you can install on your computer
and spam-filtering services that can filter spam from your
e-mail even before it arrives on your computer. For net-
work administrators, we describe how to run e-mail
servers that include spam filters.
 Part IV, “The Part of Tens,” lists ten spam scams that you
should never fall for and ten Internet annoyances — like
browser pop-ups and missing Web pages — and their
solutions.
Conventions and Icons
in This Book
When you need to give a command in a Windows, Mac, or
other windowing system, we show the command like this:
File➪Open. Choose File from the menu bar and then click
Open on the menu that appears. When we tell you to press
Ctrl+N, hold down the Ctrl (Control) key, press N, and
release the Ctrl key.

We use some icons in the left margin to tell you when some-
thing exciting is happening:
Indicates that we’re explaining a nifty shortcut or time-saver.
Lets you know that some particularly nerdy, technoid informa-
tion is coming up so that you can skip it if you want. (On the
other hand, we think that it’s interesting, and you may too.)
Yikes! We found out the hard way! Don’t let this happen to you!
Points to a gentle reminder about an important point.

Part I
The World of Spam

In this part . . .
T
en years ago, spam hardly existed, and now it wastes
the time of millions of people every day — including
you. We recommend a 3-pronged approach to ﬁghting
spam: Complain to spammers’ ISPs to get them thrown off
the Internet, lobby for effective antispam laws, and pre-
vent spam from getting into your mailbox. This part of the
book gets you up to speed on where spam comes from,
how spammers operate, and what you can do about it —
the ﬁrst two prongs of the antispam triad.

Chapter 1
How Spam Works — and
Drives You Crazy!
In This Chapter
 How it came to be called spam
 The economics of the spam business
 Why spam is so hard to stop
 An overview of spam-fighting tactics
Q
uick! It’s word-association time! When you hear the word
spam, which one do you think of:
a. A salty, pink lunch meat that comes in a blue can?
b. A goofy British comedy troupe’s skit with singing
Viking warriors?
c. Annoying junk mail and other advertisements you
never asked for that are sent to you via the Internet?
d. All of the above.
The best answer is
d. All of the above.
As most people know, SPAM (with all capital letters) is a salty,
pink lunch meat that is made by Hormel and comes in a 
blue can.
Hormel, the makers of SPAM (the lunch meat), say that if you
want to call junk e-mail by the same name, they don’t object.
You just can’t use all capital letters, like they appear on the

Part I: The World of Spam 
8
can. SPAM is lunch meat, and spam is junk e-mail. Got it? We’re
talking about spam written with lowercase letters (at the
request of Hormel) so that people don’t confuse the spam we
all hate for the SPAM that some people find tasty.
Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam,
Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam
Avid fans of the British comedy team Monty Python may
remember the skit where a husband and wife enter a restau-
rant in a seaside resort town only to find that every dish on
the menu features SPAM. Unfortunately, the wife is not at all
fond of SPAM and searches in vain for dishes that don’t have
any of the noxious substance. With SPAM appearing every-
where she turns, her frustration grows.
We’re not sure why, but the skit also features a large band of
Viking warriors lunching at the dinette who, every time the
wife says the meat’s name aloud, regularly break into a deafen-
ing song about “SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, Lovely SPAM! Wonderful
SPAM!” — adding to her confusion and anger. (For true fans of
Monty Python, however, singing Vikings at a seaside dinette
are par for the course.)
Everyone who uses the Internet has encountered loads and
loads of junk advertisements that appear when you least
expect them and usually where they’re least wanted —
namely, in your e-mail inbox and on the message boards and
newsgroups you frequent.
Legend has it that someone casting his eye over a menu of
newsgroup discussion topics kept seeing the same ads posted
in nearly every conversation thread. The continual appear-
ance of these ads in every discussion group reminded this
person of Monty Python’s seaside café with SPAM appearing
in every menu item and conversation being drowned out by
the ceaseless monotony of Viking-like advertisers.
In the Monty Python sketch, the distraught SPAM-hating wife
finally snaps and screams “I don’t like SPAM!!!” If you’re like us,

you have spent enough time sorting through the junk e-mail in
your inbox that you too have found yourself screaming about
spam.
Why Spam Works
Anyone who has ever sent an e-mail message knows that it’s a
quick, simple, and cheap process. After you have a computer
and an Internet connection, your investment is finished. To
send an e-mail, you don’t have to worry about buying enve-
lopes or stamps. You just have to have an e-mail address for
somebody, and something to say.
This same economic reality is what spammers depend on.
Sending e-mail in bulk costs the sender a tiny fraction of the
cost of sending postal mail or making telemarketing phone
calls. One person can generate huge volumes of mail with just
a few clicks of a mouse, blanketing millions of inboxes in a
matter of minutes or hours.
The economics of spam
The economics of e-mail turn all the traditional notions of
advertising on their heads. No other advertising medium
costs the recipient more than it costs the sender of the ad.
With television, print ads in newspapers, or advertisements via
the U.S. Postal Service, the sender has to spend a bundle on
printing or other preparation of the ad, delivery, and so forth.
The high cost naturally forces advertisers to be a bit picky
about how much advertising they send out, and to whom they
send it, because each additional ad bears an incremental cost.
In the world of junk e-mail marketing, it costs no more to send
the first e-mail than it does to send the ten millionth e-mail.
No economic restriction keeps marketers from blasting their
advertisements as widely and indiscriminately as possible.
They don’t even have an incentive to remove duplicate
addresses from mailing lists. Why not? When advertisers pay
nothing more for each additional message, any time spent on
editing a mailing list is time wasted.

Why spam is a bigger problem
than you think
We all get postal junk mail. That’s an accepted fact of life, at
least in the United States. You may wonder why spam is any
different.
Spam is different from the junk mail that is mailed to your
house or the telemarketing calls that interrupt your dinner,
for one simple reason: The people who send you that junk
mail and make those phone calls have to pay for the cost of
doing so, and the price can be steep. Junk mail has to be writ-
ten, designed, printed, and collated, and postage must be
paid. Telemarketers must rent office space, hire staff mem-
bers, install phones, and pay long-distance phone charges. We
don’t say this to defend them, but rather to draw a distinction
between the costs that traditional marketers incur and the
costs that a spammer doesn’t incur.
When a spammer sends an ad for herbal Viagra or an XXX-
rated Web site or canine harmonica lessons to millions of
people over the Internet, she pays almost nothing because, as
we all know, e-mail is virtually free to the party who is sending
it. But someone has to bear the cost of distributing those mil-
lions of e-mails to recipients all over the globe — and therein
lies the difference between online unsolicited advertising and
offline unsolicited advertising.
There’s no such thing as a free
lunch, particularly on the Internet
If you’re like most people, you pay an Internet service
provider (ISP) to get access to the Internet. (Even if your com-
pany or school pays for your access, someone is paying for
it.) E-mail is one of the services your ISP provides as part of
its service to you. For most people, the costs of your e-mail
service are simply bundled into your service package. In real-
ity, these costs can form a significant part of your monthly bill
(as much as $3 or $4 of a standard $19.95 charge).
Part I: The World of Spam 
10

It wasn’t long ago that ISPs charged per message for Internet
e-mail. In the early days (well, 1991, which was pretty early for
lots of Internet users), the service provider Prodigy used to
charge 25 cents per message!
Even now, users of “free” e-mail services, like Hotmail and
Yahoo! Mail, “pay” by being subjected to advertisements all
over their mailboxes, and the advertisers pay to run the
servers at those sites. What seems to be free is really just
costs factored into your service, and the costs related to
e-mail don’t stop there.
Suppose that you have a friend in Timbuktu whom you love to
hear from by e-mail. The data that makes up the e-mail from
your friend leaves her computer and begins a wondrous jour-
ney though any number of computers and networks on its way
to you. Presumably, your friend owns her computer, so the
resources used to create the message are largely hers. After
that e-mail leaves her computer, though, the entire rest of its
journey is spent bouncing around servers and careening down
transmission lines that belong to anybody other than her —
unless, of course, she happens to personally own her own
international fiber-optic network!
Considering that most of us don’t have a spare data network
lying around, when that e-mail is sent, you and your friend are
both depending on every service provider and communica-
tions network between you and Timbuktu to let that e-mail
pass through their networks. In this way, virtually every e-mail
is, to one extent or another, sent “postage due,” with the
postage being paid by everybody along the way.
Spam is a bad deal for everybody
(except the spammer)
If you think about it, sending bulk e-mail to millions of people 
is just as cheap for a spammer as it is for a faraway friend in
Timbuktu, especially when it’s compared to the cost of sending
junk ads by postal mail or telemarketing. After all, a spammer
has no printing costs, no stamps to buy, no phones to install,
no telemarketers to hire, and no long-distance calls to pay for.
Instead, a spammer sends hundreds or thousands of messages
per hour for just a fraction of a penny per spam.
Chapter 1: How Spam Works — and Drives You Crazy! 11

Just because a spammer doesn’t pay much for sending his
spam, though, doesn’t mean that someone isn’t paying — and
you would never guess who’s at the head of the list: you.
Just like a friend you may have in Timbuktu, when a spammer
decides to send the latest get-rich-quick scheme to 25 million
of his closest friends, he can get an account at a local ISP and
begin sending mail. After those 25 million messages leave his
computer, though, the vast majority of the “postage” for deliv-
ering his mail is paid for by the 25 million recipients, their
ISPs, and all the other networks, servers, and ISPs in between.
The crushing volumes of spam cost Internet service providers
(ISPs) huge amounts of money for all the servers and Internet
connection capacity needed to receive, process, store, and
deliver unwanted e-mail. Several major ISPs estimated that by
the end of 2003, spam would comprise upward of 80 percent of
their entire e-mail volume. Imagine if you had to have an 80
percent larger house because your in-laws kept coming to stay.
That’s a lot of money, not to mention the pain and suffering!
How big of a problem is spam? A study commissioned by the
European parliament in 2001 discovered that spam costs
about $9.4 billion each year — a huge bill that is being footed
by everyone except the spammers themselves. And much
more spam is flowing this year than in 2001.
Who Hath Spammed Thee?
(The Spammer Food Chain)
To understand the problem of spam, it helps to know who is
doing it and what they’re advertising. Surveying the Internet,
you can quickly see that almost no reputable marketers use
spam to advertise goods and services. That doesn’t mean that
reputable companies don’t sometimes send out e-mail that
the recipients don’t want or didn’t expect. But few legitimate
companies engage in the kinds of complex spamming cam-
paigns that are responsible for most of what is filling your
inbox.
To the contrary, the most commonly mailed spams advertise
pyramid schemes, get-rich-quick and make-money-fast scams,
Part I: The World of Spam 
12

phone-sex lines, pornographic Web sites, and quack medical
products. Most ironically, vast quantities of spam advertise
spamming software, spamming services, and lists of millions 
of e-mail addresses you can buy so that you too can become a
spammer. We have even seen spam advertising antispam filters!
When we talk about spammers, we’re really talking about at
least three categories of people who may be responsible for
putting a particular piece of spam in your inbox:
 Advertisers
 Spam service providers
 Spam support services
The first category is the advertiser. You can’t have spam with-
out somebody who wants to advertise something. They may
be sophisticated technical experts who do their own spam-
ming, or they may be computer illiterates who saw an adver-
tisement and decided to hire a third party to send spam for
them. Whoever they may be, they are generally the people
responsible for whatever message is contained in the body of
the spam, and generally the one to whom you make out the
check when it’s time to buy the miracle hair-growth and 
body-part enlargement product.
Spam service providers are people who have built up the hard-
ware, software, and expertise needed to pump out a bazillion
spam e-mails. According to many antispam experts, the great
majority of the spam you receive comes from a relative hand-
ful of professional spam service providers. They advertise
their services to the latest sucker — er, “distributor” — of the
latest get-rich-quick scheme and charge them a few hundred
bucks to send a few million spams. Even though the distribu-
tor may never make a penny from the spamming campaign,
the spam service provider has made his money, and that’s all
he cares about.
Spam support services can include ISPs and Web site hosting
services that take any customer, no matter what kind of crimi-
nal or fraudulent activity they’re engaged in. These ISPs are
often in areas of the world where the laws may be either dif-
ferent or nonexistent. China, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, and
South Korea are among the leading countries where spam
service providers have found ISPs willing to provide support
services, just as long as the checks keep clearing.

The first spammers
Back in 1994, the U.S. government
decided to hold a lottery to give away
some permanent resident visas to
immigrants seeking to stay in the
United States indefinitely. The lottery
program gave away several thou-
sand permanent residency visas, 
still called green cards (even though
they haven’t been green for many
decades), to anyone who sent a post-
card to a particular address before
the deadline date.
Several months before the deadline,
on the evening of April 12, 1994,
Laurence Canter and Martha Siegel,
a husband-and-wife lawyer team,
decided to join the lottery frenzy by
pitching their own overpriced “lottery
services” to immigrant communities.
But these two were not your run-of-
the-mill hucksters. They were inno-
vators with a penchant for tech-
nology. Canter and Siegel chose
Usenet newsgroups, and later e-mail,
as their advertising vehicles. Neither
medium would ever be the same.
Within hours, the Internet service
provider used by Canter and Siegel
had shut off their access. But the
genie was out of the bottle. The era
of spam had begun. Within weeks,
Canter and Siegel had branched out
from newsgroups to e-mail, and in a
matter of a few months they had
penned the book How to Make a
Fortune on the Information Super-
highway, which detailed their spam-
ming strategies.
Your humble co-author, Ray, had the
unfortunate experience of being on
the receiving end of many complaints
when Canter and Siegel first burst
onto the spamming scene in 1994, so
the spamming duo holds a special
spot in Ray’s heart. At the time, he
was working for the American
Immigration Lawyers Association
and was responsible for fielding com-
plaints from angry spam victims who
wanted to see the pair disbarred. Not
surprisingly, they had already been
disbarred once in the state of Florida,
and would eventually lose their law
licenses from other states as a result
of their dishonest spam campaigns.
You can still pick up a (used) copy of
their book on Amazon.com, but it’s
more of a historical footnote than a
useful how-to guide. Indeed, you can
draw a much more informative
lesson from looking at where these
morally bankrupt business ideas
landed the pair: disbarred, dead at an
early age (in the case of Ms. Siegel),
and writing software manuals (in the
case of Mr. Canter).
Canter and Siegel were trailblazers in
another sense too: Their past legal
problems seem to be a harbinger of
success in the spamming business.
Many of the most notorious spammers
now have criminal records and con-
victions for fraud and drug offenses
and have even spent time in jail.

Chapter 1: How Spam Works — and Drives You Crazy! 15
The Father of the Internet 
speaks out about spam
“Spamming is the scourge of
electronic-mail and newsgroups on
the Internet. It can seriously interfere
with the operation of public services,
to say nothing of the effect it may
have on any individual’s e-mail mail
system. Spammers are, in effect,
taking resources away from users
and service suppliers without com-
pensation and without authorization.”
— Vint Cerf, acknowledged “Father
of the Internet”
Why “Just Hit the Delete 
Key!” Is No Answer
Although spammers love to say “Just hit the Delete key,” it
totally misses the point. By the time the spam hits the fan
(well, when it hits all our mailboxes), so many costs have
been incurred by so many people other than the spammer
that it is either naïve or an utter act of denial to pretend that
those costs can be undone with the pressing of one key.
Spam is about the numbers, so let’s look at some numbers
that show why hitting the Delete key isn’t really a workable
solution. The U.S. Small Business Administration estimates
that the United States has approximately 25 million busi-
nesses. If only 1 percent of those 25 million decides to send
you just one single unsolicited e-mail per year, you average
685 spams per day in your inbox. If it takes an average of 10
seconds per message to open a message, determine that it is
spam, and hit Delete, you spend two hours per day disposing
of e-mail you never asked to receive.
More Ways You Pay for Spam
For your Internet service provider (ISP), the costs associated
with processing incoming e-mail are the same, whether or not
it’s e-mail that its customers want. The more e-mail your ISP
processes, the higher those costs. As spam volumes increase,

it begins to clog Internet bandwidth and begins to fill up the
storage disks on your ISP’s servers. Whenever you’re trying to
surf the Web, therefore, you’re competing with spam for the
use of your ISP’s Internet connection, slowing you down when
you’re surfing.
With overworked servers receiving and storing spam for hun-
dreds of thousands of users, your access to your own e-mail
can also slow down. E-mail servers are powerful machines,
capable of doing thousands of tasks per second, but even those
big machines can get bogged down. And when you’re eager to
read your e-mail, the last thing you want is to have to compete
with some spammer for access to your ISP’s mail servers.
Every once in a while, an ISP gets so overloaded with spam
that its servers crash. This situation causes everybody who
was depending on that server to be inconvenienced. It may
also be more than an inconvenience if, for example, your com-
pany’s e-commerce Web site was on that same server or a
bunch of customers’ orders were in the e-mails that got scram-
bled when the server gave up the ghost. Calculating the cost in
terms of lost business opportunities when customers can’t
reach you or think that you’re ignoring them is almost impossi-
ble, but those are more costs you bear, thanks to spammers.
Eventually, if the service quality gets too bad, to keep sub-
scribers from jumping to a competitor, an ISP begins buying
more Internet bandwidth and more servers. Of course, it needs
to be hiring more staff members to install that equipment and
to keep everything running. At some point, those costs get
passed back to you — perhaps in the form of rate hikes or
longer hold times when you call your ISP for customer service.
While he was working on this book, co-author John, who pro-
vides mail service for a few dozen friends and web-hosting
users on his tiny network, had to spend about $1,000 upgrading
the mail server, just to deal with the increase in spam.
The number of unsolicited messages sent out each day is truly
remarkable. The spam-filtering company Brightmail claims that
its research has shown more than 25 million unsolicited mes-
sages being sent per day in 1998. By 2002, AOL and Hotmail
both claimed that they were blocking nearly a billion pieces of
spam each day, and still more was slipping through. According
to a September 2003 survey by InformationWeek, spam volumes
Part I: The World of Spam 
16

were growing at 37 percent per month, for an annual growth
rate of more than 400 percent!
Numerous court cases are under way between spammers and
innocent victims who have been subjected to these types of
floods. Unfortunately, although major corporations can afford
to fight these cutting-edge cyberlaw battles, small mom-and-
pop ISPs and their customers are left to suffer the floods.
Here’s another cost you may not have thought of: your time.
Because of the volume of spam zipping around the Internet,
downloading your e-mail takes longer. Although you may call
a local number to connect with the Internet, lots of other
people pay by the minute for the time they spend online.
Because of spam, it takes them longer to get their e-mail, and
spam costs them money in connection charges every month.
Calling Erin Brockovich!
If you saw the movie Erin Brockovich (which was based on a
true story), you know that the sassy heroine does battle with
a polluting power company that has dumped nasty gunk into
the groundwater, which is causing the citizens in a nearby
town to become quite sick. Oddly enough, noxious floods of
spam have a similar effect on the health of the Internet and all
the netizens who use it.
The reason that companies dump toxic waste into lakes and
rivers is that they have done the math. It may cost them many
millions of dollars per year to properly dispose of the waste
from one plant. Or, they can just dump it into the river for free.
Economists call the toxic waste an externality, which is their
word for something that gets generated as a by-product of
someone’s moneymaking activity, the cost of which gets “paid
for” by all the citizens who then have a greater risk of disease.
If the pollution levels stay relatively low, some people may
never notice that they’re slowly being poisoned and they may
eventually die of something else. Occasionally, though, some-
body does get sick, and for them, the cost of that pollution
suddenly becomes great. As in the movie, companies gamble
that the amount they may have to pay for an occasional illness
Chapter 1: How Spam Works — and Drives You Crazy! 17

is less than the amount that they would have had to pay to dis-
pose of the waste properly.
Just like polluters, spammers try to spread the costs of their
spam across wider and wider populations of Internet users,
knowing that as long as they don’t give a “fatal” dose to any
single Internet service provider (ISP), they can continue their
spamming relatively unnoticed and everyone pays their little
portion, never being the wiser or bothering to fight back.
Why Spam Is Hard to Stop
If you have ever spent an hour trying to coax, cajole, and
threaten your computer into doing something it stubbornly
refused to do, the following statement may come as a sur-
prise: Simplicity is at the core of how the Internet works, espe-
cially when it comes to something as ubiquitous as e-mail.
Part of what made it become so widely used is that it was
easy for Internet service providers to implement and simple
for software developers to program tools to use it.
At the heart of e-mail is a set of technical standards and
Internet protocols that are so simple, they’re called the Simple
Mail Transport Protocol, or SMTP. You may have even seen the
letters SMTP when you set up your e-mail software — it’s the
technology by which e-mail gets sent from a sending e-mail
server at an Internet service provider (ISP) to a receiving
e-mail server at another ISP. (Other protocols help you retrieve
mail after it has been received at your ISP. Two of them, POP
and IMAP, are in the spam-filtering chapters in Part II.)
As the popularity of the Internet grew, e-mail evolved from a
novelty to a necessity. All e-mail now transmitted across the
Internet is sent using the agreed-on industry standard, SMTP.
Any server that “speaks” SMTP can send mail to, and receive
mail from, any other server that speaks SMTP.
Because a server may be processing a dozen or more message
connections per second, the SMTP “conversation” must be kept
very brief. How brief? Well, before the entire e-mail message
gets dumped onto a receiving server, only three pieces of infor-
mation are received before the mail is delivered: the identity of
the sending server, the From address, and the To address.
Part I: The World of Spam 
18

The price of speed: Accuracy
SMTP is fast and simple — so simple that it has no mechanism
for verifying the validity of either the identity of the sending
server or the accuracy of the From address. The SMTP server
has no way to verify assertions such as “This message is from
Chapter 1: How Spam Works — and Drives You Crazy! 19
A Nobel prize in spam?
No, there isn’t really a Nobel prize for
spam. But a famous economist named
Ronald Coase won a Nobel prize for
writing, among other things, about
why sometimes governments must
step in when the marketplace is
broken. Specifically, Coase discussed
the dangers to the free market when
an inefficient business — one that
cannot bear the costs of its own activ-
ities — distributes its costs across a
large population of victims.
The classic example is pollution: It’s
much cheaper for a chemical manu-
facturer to dump toxic waste into the
local river than to treat it and dispose
of it in a more environmentally sensi-
tive manner. By creating such exter-
nalities, as economists call them, a
polluter can maximize its own profit,
even if it comes at another’s — or
everyone’s — expense. Certainly
those who are harmed by poisons in
a river may be able to sue, but for the
vast majority of victims, the cost of
hiring a lawyer, assembling evidence,
hiring experts, and bearing all the
other costs and complexities means
that most victims can never hold the
polluter accountable for the harm it
has done.
Much is the same when it comes to
spam. Although some companies
have successfully sued junk e-mailers
for the damage they have caused, few
ISPs can afford to fight these kinds 
of cutting-edge cyberlaw battles. As 
a result, the economics favor the
abusers and disfavor the spam vic-
tims. Indeed, spammers are counting
on the incremental cost of each spam,
foisted on each individual member of
the public at large, being ignored.
As Coase pointed out, this situation is
a prescription for economic disaster.
When inefficiencies are allowed to
continue, the free market no longer
functions properly. The “invisible
hands” that would normally balance
the market and keep it efficient
cannot function when the market is
carrying the dead weight of spam-
mers. Unchecked, businesses that
depend on stealing time, money, and
resources from unwilling recipients
must be stopped, or else they will
continue to leech the life out of our
economic system.

your bank and concerns your account” or “This message con-
tains the tracking number for your online order” or “Here is
that newsletter about investment tips that you paid $29 per
month to receive.”
So why not replace SMTP with something better?
Well, Winston Churchill once said that democracy is the worst
way of doing government, except for all the others. SMTP is,
as Churchill may have said, the worst way of “doing” e-mail,
except for all the others that have been tried. The reality is
that SMTP works reliably and has been pretty much univer-
sally implemented.
To swap out SMTP for something “better” would be much like
telling American automobile drivers that, starting next
Thursday, we all have to start driving on the left side of the
road. Not only would lots of people be completely confused,
but lots of the fundamental infrastructure would need to be
redesigned. And lots of people simply wouldn’t be able to get
stuff done for a very long time.
In short, the need for speed creates a system that has virtu-
ally no technical consequences for being a liar. That is pre-
cisely why spammers have been, and continue to be,
incredibly effective in delivering unwanted e-mail. So, until
somebody thinks up a better way of doing e-mail, as well as a
way to implement it without bringing everything to a screech-
ing halt, we’re stuck with this simple way of doing e-mail that
is also quite vulnerable to abuse.
Whitelists, blacklists, filters
Some ISPs do try to take steps to deal with spam during the
e-mail delivery process. Three popular approaches are shown
in this list:
 Whitelists are lists of servers known to be sending good,
legitimate, nonspam e-mails. During the SMTP conversa-
tion, the address of the sending server can be compared
to a whitelist and, if it’s on the list, the mail gets delivered.
 Blacklists, also called blocklists, work just the opposite of
whitelists. Blacklists are lists of servers that are known to
be operated by spammers or that have been used to send
Part I: The World of Spam 
20

spam in the past. When a sending server attempts to con-
nect to the receiving server, the sender’s address is com-
pared to the blacklist, and if it’s there, the mail is rejected.
 Filters allow programs to look at e-mail messages and
guess whether they are spam. After an e-mail message
has been delivered, the filter compares it against a list of
words, phrases, or other kinds of identifiers that can be
used to determine whether the message is legitimate or
spam. New filtering techniques, including something
called Bayesian filtering technology, make filtering much
more accurate than it used to be. (Look on a nearby page
for the sidebar “Bayesian what?” for more information on
this new filtering approach.)
Unfortunately, although whitelists, blacklists, and filters can
catch lots of spam, they are not without their downsides. The
kinds of powerful e-mail servers that ISPs run can send and
receive hundreds or thousands of e-mails per second. But when
the server has to stop and compare each message to a list, or
run the message contents through a filter, that processing
speed can slow to a crawl.
The maintenance of whitelists and blacklists can also be quite
time consuming, and can often produce errors. For example, it
may be necessary to call up somebody on a telephone to verify
the identity of a sender before an ISP will add a server’s address
to a whitelist. Similarly, a server that may send legitimate e-mail
may also send spam occasionally, and may require additional
investigation before it can reliably be added to a blacklist. Even
then, no guarantee exists that a whitelisted server won’t start
spamming tomorrow and that blacklisting a server won’t result
in losing legitimate e-mail.
Can You Really Fight Back
Against Spam? Yes!
Before we go any further, we should apologize if this chapter
is depressing. Spam is a difficult problem that causes tremen-
dous frustration for many people, including you — otherwise,
we suspect that you would be reading another, more exciting,
title in the fine For Dummies book series.
Chapter 1: How Spam Works — and Drives You Crazy! 21

The purpose of this chapter isn’t to make you run away
screaming from all Internet technology. Rather, its purpose is
to make sure that you understand that fighting spam is an
ongoing and sometimes complicated project.
If somebody out there could invent a magic wand to wave over
an Internet e-mail server and make spam go away, somebody
would have done it long ago. No, spam has no quick solutions.
Part I: The World of Spam 
22
Bayesian what?
The current cutting edge in spam-
filtering technology is a category of
e-mail filters built around something
called Bayesian analysis. Named
after the British-born church minister
and part-time mathematician Thomas
Bayes (1702-1761), the Bayesian
approach is based on a theory of sta-
tistical analysis described in an
essay that Bayes wrote, but that
wasn’t published until 1764, three
years after his death.
Bayes’ idea was that you could
determine the probability of an event
by looking at lots of similar circum-
stances and working out the
frequency with which previous judg-
ments about the occurrence had
been accurate or inaccurate. In other
words, Bayes said that a mathemati-
cal equation can be created that
would not only tell you how probable
a particular event is, but also auto-
matically fine-tune the equation so
that the next prediction would be a
little more accurate.
If you think that this idea sounds like a
mathematical theory that would allow,
for example, a computer to learn by
itself automatically, you have grasped
the awesome power of Bayesian
analysis!
When applied to spam, Bayesian
filters start by looking at a whole
bunch of e-mails, which it asks the
user to identify as good mail or bad. It
then figures out on its own which
characteristics are common to the
good mail and which characteristics
are common to the bad mail. Each
new e-mail message that passes
through your system is then compared
against that base of knowledge, and a
probability rating is assigned to it. It
then reworks its calculations after
looking at all the good and bad e-mail
it has processed and continues over
time to learn and refine its analysis
methods.
As a concept, Bayesian analysis has
been proving effective at identifying
spam, and therefore is a frequent
feature in many new antispam tech-
nologies, some of which we describe
in greater detail in Part III of this
book.

Thanks to lots of hard work by lots of clever people, though,
you can indeed do many things to help make your inbox a
cleaner and friendlier place. You can use a growing number of
tools and technologies that, with some work, lots of patience,
and a little luck, can make your e-mail experience much more
pleasant.
Many technologies discussed in Parts II and III of this book fall
into the three categories of whitelists, blacklists, and filters.
For example, certain antispam services depend on turning
your e-mail address book into a kind of whitelist, ensuring that
you always get e-mail from those people you know. Others
implement sophisticated filtering techniques, and still others
use known sources of spam to create blacklists that block
unwanted e-mail.
None of the technologies we discuss would qualify as a “silver
bullet” to stop all spam forever, but they can definitely make a
dent in the amount of spam you receive. All it takes is a strong
distaste for spam and a willingness to give these new tech-
nologies a chance.

have even gotten a new Internet service provider (ISP) and
started using one of its e-mail accounts for your day-to-day
e-mail needs. And, like many millions of people, the volumes
of spam pouring into your e-mail inbox may have begun to
drive you so insane that you periodically change your e-mail
address just to try to stay one step ahead of the spammers.
But they found you again, didn’t they?
The (depressing) reality of e-mail is that escaping spam is
almost impossible. In fact, you may commonly see someone
create a brand-new e-mail account and then, in the time
between the moment the account is activated and the owner
logs in to the account, see spam already waiting.
How does it happen? The rest of this chapter is devoted to
explaining how spammers find your address and what — if
anything — you can do about it.

Part I: The World of Spam 
26
When You’re a Spammer, the
World Is Your Garden
Since the first e-mail spammers began their reigns of terror
over our inboxes, they got the e-mail addresses for their mail-
ing lists by gathering them from anywhere they could. Here
are some fertile fields where spammers look to find usable
e-mail addresses:
 Chat rooms
 Message boards
 Usenet newsgroups
 Discussion mailing lists
 Online-service member directories
 Web pages
If an e-mail address was anywhere to be seen, spammers
grabbed it and added it to their lists. Soon, the tedious task of
manually scanning Web pages and chat rooms gave way to
automated bots (short for robots) that systematically scoured
through member directories and chat rooms on AOL, Web
sites, and message boards. Everything with an @ in the middle
was fair game.
The spammers call this process address harvesting. But the
noted privacy and antispam advocate Jason Catlett, the opera-
tor of the privacy resource Web site Junkbusters.com, points
out that the word harvest isn’t accurate because it implies that
you have a right to be picking something from that garden.
Because spammers are usually violating ISP user agreements
and loads of other rules, Catlett suggests that poaching is a far
more appropriate term.
If you have an account on AOL, you can do a little experiment
to see how efficient spammers have gotten at grabbing screen
names. First, create a new screen name on your AOL account.
(Each account can have as many as seven active screen names;
see the AOL keyword screen names.) After you have created a
new screen name, go to the chat rooms (AOL keyword chat).
You’re placed in a chatting “lobby” with a few dozen other chat-
ters. Just sit there and wait for the magic words “You’ve got
mail!”

In repeated experiments, the longest time spent in an AOL chat
room before receiving e-mail spam was about 30 minutes. The
shortest? Less than a minute. (And it was just e-mail spam; the
Instant Message spam messages began almost as quickly.)
After you’re done with the experiment, you can delete your
newly created screen name. But what if you don’t? Try it! Wait a
few days, and then log back in to see how much spam has accu-
mulated. Your humble co-author Ray has some AOL screen
names he hasn’t used for years, but keeps an eye on just for
fun. One screen name hasn’t been logged in to a chat room in
this century, yet still averages 30 or more spams a week.
From the Yellow Pages 
to the Dictionary
For many years, spammers were content with just scouring
chat rooms, member directories on popular chat services,
and Web pages, looking for random e-mail addresses to add to
their lists. Soon, however, that got to be too much trouble for
our intrepid spamming brethren (and sisteren?).
Remember that spammers are in the spamming business
because getting a real job would cut into their Jerry Springer–
watchin’ time, so anything that saves them time and effort is a
special treat. Spammers have therefore found a new way to
get e-mail addresses: Make them up!
The origin of the make-them-up process, or dictionary method,
has been lost to the mists of history. But we think that it went
something like this:
One day, an enterprising young spammer was sorting his volu-
minous e-mail address database and noticed some obvious
patterns:
John1@aol.com
John1@hotmail.com
John1@earthlink.com
John2@aol.com
John2@hotmail.com
John2@earthlink.com
John3@aol.com
John3@hotmail.com
Chapter 2: How Spammers Get Your Address 27

“Why couldn’t I just try following those naming patterns at all
the popular domain names and see whether the mail goes
through?” the spammer asked himself. So, he did a little
research and found out the domain names of the 50 largest
Internet service providers. Then he found some Web sites that
list the 50 most popular male and female first names. The
spammer then plugged all that information into his database
software and told the software to tack on numbers in
sequence, and within a couple of hours he had a database
with about 125 million e-mail addresses in it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, the dictionary method works well
with last names too — and sports team names, cities and
states, names of movie stars, names of book characters, and
even random words from the dictionary!
Can 125 million e-mail addresses really be valid? Not by a long
shot. Because it doesn’t cost a spammer any more to send
something to 124 million invalid addresses than it does to
send to the 1 million valid ones he stumbled on, the waste
doesn’t really matter. In fact, the reality is that in sending to
randomly generated addresses, enough of them got delivered
to enough suckers that the spammer was able to sell enough
boxes of miracle weight-loss cure to make his next layaway
payment on a new pair of fuzzy dice for his 1990 Ford Festiva.
As a bonus, when John3@aol.com got tired of all the spam
and signed up as John5233@hotmail.com, the spam contin-
ued flowing without a hiccup.
So, if you just opened a brand-new e-mail account and already
had spam waiting the first time you logged in, you can probably
blame a dictionary spammer. Even if you thought that you were
being obscure when you set up the e-mail name nannygoat_
snorkel@yahoo.com, it’s just a matter of time before the spam-
mer’s dictionary catches up to you!
Keeping One Step Ahead
of the Spammers
If it’s just a matter of time before a spammer catches up to
your e-mail address, is there any hope? Sure, you have some
Part I: The World of Spam 
28

hope. But, truth be told, you can do little to completely avoid
spam. What hope you have comes from taking a few basic
actions to keep your e-mail address a little more low profile:
 Know where your e-mail address can be found (white
pages and Web pages, for example): Do you know who
has your e-mail address? Do you participate in chat
rooms? Message boards? Newsgroups? Do you have your
e-mail address posted on your Web page?
Try typing your e-mail address into a search engine and
seeing what pops up. The answer to the age-old question
of “How did those #*@%#$ get my e-mail address?” may
be that you gave it to them!
 Guard your primary e-mail address: When somebody
asks for your e-mail address, think twice before giving it
out. Or, shield yourself behind an e-mail alias. Many ISPs
allow you to create multiple e-mail addresses, which can
be used for creating “sacrificial” e-mail addresses you
can give out to people you’re not sure you trust. For
more information on creating and using e-mail aliases,
see the sidebar “Dodging Spam with Mailshell,” later in
this chapter.
 Use stand-alone e-mail software: Most Internet browsers
come bundled with e-mail programs. The problem is that
by bundling the two, you may be making it easy for hack-
ers, spammers, and unscrupulous Webmasters to get your
e-mail address from your browser. For that reason, we sug-
gest using a stand-alone e-mail product, like Eudora
(www.eudora.com) or Pegasus (www.pmail.com). See
Chapter 8 for information about those software packages.
 Play hide-and-seek with your browser: Even if you’re
using a stand-alone e-mail program, you may have at
some time recorded your e-mail address somewhere
within your browser, or your browser may have even
grabbed it and given it away for you in an attempt to be
helpful. Because the whole purpose of a browser is to
share information between computers, it may be giving
away that information about you to others whenever
they know the right way to ask for it. If you think that
your browser may be blowing the whistle on you, here’s
how to shut down the little snitch:
Chapter 2: How Spammers Get Your Address 29

In Netscape: Choose Edit➪Preferences from the
menu bar atop the browser window. On the list along
the left side of the Preferences dialog box, click the
plus sign (+) next to the Mail & Newsgroups option.
Then select Identity, which appears just below the
plus sign. On the right side of the dialog box appears
any of your personal information that the browser
has stored. Erase all personal information you see
there and click OK to accept the changes.
In Internet Explorer: Choose Tools➪Internet Options
from the menu bar atop the browser window. In the
Internet Options dialog box, select the Content tab
and click the My Profile button. Erase all personal
information that appears on this form. Click OK to
accept the changes.
In Opera: Choose E-Mail➪Edit Active Account from
the menu bar atop the browser window. Erase all
personal information that appears in the right half
of the dialog box.
 Choose an ISP that actively blocks spam: Several large
national ISPs — like AOL, EarthLink, and AT&T — have
some spam-blocking features, so if yours has them, make
sure that you use them. Although you’re likely to have
more difficulty finding a local ISP that blocks spam, many
are run by system administrators who are veterans of the
spam wars and know how to offer spam protection that’s
so vigorous it makes nuclear missile silos look poorly
defended. It’s always worth asking around.
 Find out how to filter your own e-mail: Some e-mail soft-
ware programs have filtering features that, if you take the
time to read the instructions, can be useful in helping
you manage your mailbox in many ways, including help-
ing you filter spam directly into the trash. Be ready to
experiment with those settings, and don’t autodelete any-
thing until you’re absolutely certain that your filters are
working right. If your filter eats that e-mail from Aunt
Ethel, you may get a cold reception (and dinner) when
you head for her house next Thanksgiving.
For more information about filtering, see Chapter 5.

 Never — never — click Reply: Most return addresses in
spam are faked to deflect complaints. However, some
spammers use real addresses because they really do want
to hear from you — but not for the reason you may think.
Why would they want to hear your angry diatribe? When
you click Reply, you have just confirmed that your e-mail

Dodging spam with Mailshell
Several years ago, a clever concept in
Web-based e-mail services appeared
on the scene. Named Mailshell
(http://www.mailshell.com),
the concept behind it is simple: 
If spammers can randomly pick
e-mail addresses out of thin air, why
can’t you?
For about $3 per month, Mailshell
gives you an unlimited number of 
e-mail addresses and allows you 
to make them up instantly, with-
out any advance preparation. For
example, you may create a Mailshell
account named snidely, where-
upon you’re informed that all your
Mailshell e-mail addresses will end 
in @snidely.mailshell.com.
You then tell Mailshell to forward 
all mail to your well-hidden and
unguessable address, we0ce7x9w@
some-isp.com.
Then, when you go to your local 
oil-change place and someone there
asks for your e-mail address, you can
cheerfully say “Sure! It’s Jippylube@
snidely.mailshell.com.” When
the oil-change place sends you e-mail
to remind you that it’s time for a new air
filter, the mail to the Jippylube alias is
quietly forwarded to your well-hidden
e-mail address without the oil people
ever knowing it.
As though that weren’t exciting
enough, there’s more! If you start get-
ting spam addressed to the Jippylube
alias, you know which slimeballs sold
the spammers the address! Then,
when you get tired of receiving the
spam sent to the Jippylube alias, you
can log in to the Mailshell Web site
and have it routed directly to the
trash and not forwarded to you.
What if you get e-mail to a Mailshell
address and you want to reply? Isn’t
your hidden e-mail address exposed?
The clever people at Mailshell
already thought of that! If you click
the Reply button, the e-mail goes
back to the Mailshell system, where
your real e-mail address is stripped
out, the alias is reinserted as the
From address, and the recipient is
none the wiser.
With an unlimited supply of e-mail
addresses at your disposal (disposal
is an important word here), you
always know who is responsible for
your spam, and you can turn it off as
easily as flipping a switch.

address is a live one, which is like waving a big red flag
and screaming “This e-mail address is real! I really read
this stuff! If you’re smart, you’ll send me more spam!”
 Establish secondary screen names for chat rooms and
message boards: Chat rooms and message boards are
among the most appealing places for spammers to gather
e-mail addresses. Protect your primary e-mail address by
creating other, throwaway e-mail addresses for posting
on message boards and for giving out to people and sites
you’re not sure you can trust. Many ISPs — like AOL,
AT&T, and others — allow you to create secondary
screen names or additional e-mail addresses at little or
no cost, or you can get free e-mail addresses from Yahoo!,
Hotmail, and other free e-mail services. If spam comes
flooding into those accounts, you can always delete them
and make a new one, all the while shielding your primary
address from the flood. For more on free e-mail services
like Hotmail and Yahoo! Mail, see Chapter 10.
 Give and use false e-mail addresses: This advice is quite
controversial. Many people know that spammers troll
through chat rooms and message boards looking for
e-mail addresses, so they use fake or altered — some-
times called munged (rhymes with plunged) — e-mail
addresses. For example, JohnDoe123@hotmail.com may
give out his address as JohnDoe123@I-hate-spam.
hotmail.com and then give written or verbal instruc-
tions to friends and associates to remove the I-hate-
spam. part before sending him e-mail. This strategy
tends to confound many spammers because they often
use automated e-mail harvesting programs that gather
anything with an @ sign in the middle; because the spam-
mers are too lazy to sort the millions of addresses by
hand, they usually end up sending their spam to the
altered address.
Why is munging controversial? Depending on how you
munge the address, when the spammer sends the mail, it
may still end up in somebody’s mailbox, most likely that
of the already overworked and spam-flooded administra-
tor of your ISP or free e-mail provider. The other reason
is that many people use mail programs that don’t show
the e-mail address of people they’re writing to, so they
don’t notice the munge or may not even realize that it’s
possible that the address isn’t real, and real mail gets
lost. Please think twice before trying this one at home.
Part I: The World of Spam 
32

 Use a unique e-mail account name not found in a dic-
tionary: Pick an e-mail address like sdfj4kl6@hotmail.
com or qw2eru9@Yahoo.com so that spammers are less
likely to pull your e-mail address out of a hat, thin air, or
the dictionary. Sure, it’s difficult to remember, but see the
nearby sidebar, “Dodging spam with Mailshell,” for a way
around that problem.
 Find out how and where to complain to get spammers
shut down: The best defense is a good offense. When
spammers are offending you, offend them right back by
finding out how to get them booted off their ISPs. And
how can you do that, you ask? Keep reading.

There Oughtta Be a Law
Against Spam!
In This Chapter
 The arguments for and against spam laws
 Who defines what spam is?
 Current U.S. and international laws
 Problems with enforcement
 What makes an effective antispam law?
S
ince the earliest days of the spam problem, spam victims
have looked to various places for help in stopping it.
When the immigration attorneys Laurence Canter and Martha
Siegel let loose one of the world’s first major spamming cam-
paigns (as described in Chapter 1), the call went out for their
law licenses to be stripped.
Although it took a few years (and a few more legal and ethical
transgressions) for Canter and Siegel to be sent looking for
another line of work, it was clear early on that people want to
see spammers held legally accountable for their misbehavior.
Over the next decade, consumer activists, online marketers,
legislators, lawyers, lobbyists, and civil liberties experts fought
over the best way to squash spammers — legally speaking.
Is Spam Already Illegal?
Many aspects of spam are already outlawed by state and fed-
eral antifraud laws and other consumer protection statutes
dealing with unfair and deceptive business practices. Many

Part I: The World of Spam 
36
products and services promoted via spam, like get-rich-quick
schemes and quack medical remedies, are already illegal
under existing laws. In addition, many technical tricks that
spammers use to hijack e-mail servers are outlawed by state
and federal computer crime statutes. Several Internet service
providers (ISPs) have also successfully sued spammers under
laws relating to trademark misuse and the private-property
rights of network owners.
Yet many people are still calling for more laws directly target-
ing spam. Why? In part, because even though existing laws
may outlaw lots of spam already, somebody forgot to tell the
spammers. Spam volumes are still increasing, according to a
September 2003 survey in Information Week, at a rate of 37
percent per month!
Libertarians, stop reading here!
So, if spammers are already ignoring the law, wouldn’t new
laws be similarly ineffective? Why bother passing new laws if
the old ones aren’t working? This argument is often heard
from libertarian commentators.
Discussions of Internet-related legal issues invariably bring
out the libertarian streak in many legal and social commenta-
tors. Most libertarians, especially those who comment on
Internet issues, tend to argue that most laws are bad or irrele-
vant or both. These people favor letting others use technol-
ogy and the power of economics and the free market to protect
themselves.
Unlike the so-called liberal bias in the news media, Internet
old-timers have a definite libertarian bias. That bias is the
reason that nearly every news article about spam laws usually
ends with some commentator saying “Of course, any effort to
use laws to stop spammers is doomed to failure.”
Why? The usual reasons that are given are shown in this list:
 Spammers are impossible to find because they use e-mail
servers in foreign countries.
 If you do manage to find the spammers, you can never
get them into court because they’re in foreign countries.

 Even if you manage to find spammers in the United States,
they just move their business off-shore and keep on
spamming.
Of course, none of those reasons is true; for example:
 Chapter 4 shows you how easy it can be to track spam-
mers back to the ISPs where their spam originates.
 Spammers can send their mail off servers in another
galaxy, but as long as the spammers themselves, or the
product peddlers who hire them, have some connection
to the United States, U.S. laws apply.
 The guy selling phony Viagra out of his bedroom to earn
some extra cash isn’t likely to unhitch his trailer-home
and drive to a Caribbean nation to avoid prosecution.
For the sake of argument, assume that spam laws would be
difficult to enforce. What do the naysayers think will be the
ultimate solution to the spam problem? It’s the same thing that
created the problem in the first place, of course: technology!
Yes, technology alone can solve the spam problem, even
though nearly a decade after spam became a problem, tech-
nology hasn’t yet solved it.
Technology isn’t the only answer
The unfortunate reality of spam is that the technology of
spamming is evolving just as rapidly as the technology to stop
it. In fact, the contest between spamming technology and anti-
spamming technology is very much a rigged game.
The success of e-mail is due in large part to the flexibility of
e-mail technology and the fundamental premise on which it is
built: Make it easy and reliable for anybody to send anything
to anybody. The people who invented today’s e-mail protocols
did a good job.
Ten years into the fight against spam, spammers are, ironi-
cally, proving in some ways that e-mail is as powerful and
resilient as it is supposed to be. To prove it, spammers aren’t
merely using e-mail — they’re abusing it in ways that are
sometimes as elegant as they are obscene.
Chapter 3: There Oughtta Be a Law Against Spam! 37

It’s doubly ironic that, in an effort to save e-mail from collaps-
ing under the weight of spammers’ abuse, spam fighters are
scrambling to create new technical methods of “breaking”
e-mail of the flexibility that spammers exploit. It’s a little like
burning down the forest to stop the forest fire.
Where The Law helps all this is to act like an impartial, unbi-
ased referee. If the game is rigged in favor of spammers, the
law can step in and move the ball 10 yards closer to the goal
line.
Laws can do stuff that 
technology can’t
Laws can decide that what may be “legal” according to the
rules of e-mail software is definitely not legal in the eyes of the
law. And, to the best of our knowledge, no software out there
can throw you in jail for ignoring a programming command.
But spam laws can also make things easier for spam victims to
hold their abusers accountable in ways that technology can’t.
For example, in bringing a traditional lawsuit, you often have
to demonstrate damages. How much damage does a single
spam message cause? Very little, of course, just like a single
raindrop that is harmless until it joins with billions more like
it and washes you out to sea.
A law that establishes the harmful nature of spam and sets a
fixed amount of damage, such as $500 per spam message, gets
around the issue of trying to prove damages. It also gets
around ancient judges who still think that typewriters are a
little too newfangled. In some of the earliest antispam law-
suits, attorneys had to present months of arguments and evi-
dence to even convince the judges that spam was a problem.
If a law says in black and white that spam is illegal, a judge
doesn’t need to understand bits and bytes.
Spam: The Elusive Definition
The challenge for any effective antispam law is to truly stop
spammers. One key to that goal is to define spam, although it
turns out that that’s easier said than done.
Part I: The World of Spam 
38

If you’re like most people, it takes only a few seconds of read-
ing through an e-mail message to know whether that message
is spam. But whether you’re programming antispam filtering
technology or trying to write a law that makes spamming 
illegal, translating your instantaneous ability to recognize
spam into a mathematical equation or a piece of legislative
language is a complicated matter.
In a famous Supreme Court decision about pornography and
censorship, Justice Potter Stewart recognized that defining
the term pornography can be nearly impossible because
people have differing opinions about the artistic value of a
given image. But even if he couldn’t define it, he famously
wrote, “I know it when I see it.”
How art thou spam?
Many antispam laws that have been passed in recent years
have sought to define the characteristics of spam in several
ways:
 Unsolicited or solicited: Was the message sent to some-
one who specifically and knowingly asked to receive that
particular message? For example, is the e-mail a response
to a direct inquiry, such as a request for information
about a specific product, or did the recipient give the
sender a business card at a booth on the floor of a con-
vention exhibit hall and ask to be e-mailed with product
information?
 Permission or relationship: Did the recipient of the
e-mail address give permission, either expressly or in
some sort of implied fashion? For example, did the recipi-
ent, while shopping online for car loan information, sign
up to receive interest rate alerts from banks in the car
loan business? Or does the e-mail recipient have an
existing business relationship with the sender through
which e-mail communications are an implied part of that
relationship?
 Commercial or noncommercial: Does the e-mail mes-
sage advertise the commercial availability of a product
or service offered for sale or lease? Or is the message a
solicitation for charitable contributions or promoting a
political or religious cause?
Chapter 3: There Oughtta Be a Law Against Spam! 39

 Bulk or not bulk: Was the e-mail message sent in bulk to
hundreds or thousands or millions of recipients? Does 
it make any difference if the message was a one-time
message addressed manually to just a handful of people?
 E-mail or something else: Is the message coming via
e-mail or through a similar channel, such as text messag-
ing to a cellular telephone? Does the message appear in
an e-mail inbox or as a pop-up window on a computer
desktop?
 Forged headers: Does the e-mail message contain any
forged information, such as a false From address or 
a nonexistent Reply-To address? Does it have other 
fake addresses or falsified routing information in its
headers? (For more information about e-mail headers,
see Chapter 4.)
 Misleading Subject lines: Does the e-mail message try to
trick the recipient into opening it by having a Subject line
completely unrelated to the topic of the message? For
example, does the e-mail subject say “About Your
Christmas Gift Order,” but the message contains an
advertisement for a miracle weight-loss cure?
 Fraudulent content: Is the e-mail message advertising an
illegal get-rich-quick scheme or a bogus work-from-home
program or touting some unknown company whose stock
is about to go through the roof?
 Bogus opt-out: Does the message offer to remove you
from its mailing list, but when you click the link, the
removal Web page doesn’t exist? Does it direct you to
reply with “unsubscribe” on the Subject line, but the
e-mail bounces back saying “user unknown?” Or does
clicking the Remove button net you more spam?
Spam is in the eye of the beholder
Here’s an appalling fact: The reason spammers stay in busi-
ness is that somewhere out there, somebody gets an e-mail
message containing all the earmarks of spam — the forged
headers, the bad Subject lines, the bogus opt-out links, the
ads touting the quack medical remedy — and buys the product
anyway!

Don’t believe us? Just ask Terry Goddard — the attorney gen-
eral of the state of Arizona. In 2003, his office seized from a
band of crooks palatial homes, luxury cars, and piles of cash
totaling more than $45 million. Their crime? Spamming adver-
tisements for bogus creams and pills that claim to enlarge
your sex organs.
All that money has been put into a restitution fund to pay
back people who bought the phony cures. Perhaps not sur-
prisingly, nobody has stepped forward to ask for their money
back.
If people will spend millions on bogus remedies, they will
undoubtedly spend more if the products are legitimate, no
matter how they’re advertised. Just look at spam’s annoying
cousin: telemarketing. People say that they hate telemarketing
calls, yet those same people pay upward of $60 billion for
goods and services each year through telemarketing.
Chapter 3: There Oughtta Be a Law Against Spam! 41
Joining the CAUCE
In 1996, a group of antispam advo-
cates were chatting (via e-mail, of
course) about how best to tackle
the growing spam problem. Many
participants were technical experts
working at ISPs and network adminis-
trators operating e-mail systems at
major corporations. A few were also
marketers who were beginning to
use the Internet for legitimate elec-
tronic commerce and were horrified
by the spamming ways of their fellow
marketers.
Over the course of many months
spent discussing various technical
approaches to fighting spam, several
participants came to the conclusion
that spam fighters needed some legal
weaponry along with their technol-
ogy arsenal.
In 1997, a group of antispam activists,
including two of the co-authors of
this book, Ray and John, joined sev-
eral other spam fighters to create an
organization to fight for antispam laws.
The Coalition Against Unsolicited
Commercial Email (CAUCE) rapidly
became the leading consumer advo-
cacy group fighting spam, signing up
tens of thousands of members in its
first year of operation. Ever since,
CAUCE has been educating lawmak-
ers and influencing the debate over
how best to deal with spam.
CAUCE costs nothing to join, and it
doesn’t ask for donations. It’s an all-
volunteer organization. It offers a
newsletter that periodically alerts
you to developments in the world of
spam-related laws. To learn more,
visit www.cauce.org.

For some number of people, spam isn’t about whether an
e-mail message delivers an advertisement in some unaccept-
able way, with fake addresses and bogus opt-out promises.
No, for those people, the first question is “Do I want what is
being advertised?”
That question is the core of why it’s so hard to define spam.
For some percentage of the population, the definition of spam
depends on the recipient’s feelings at the precise moment the
e-mail message is received, and the feeling can change from
one moment to the next.
If the people receiving spam can’t decide what spam is, how
can any technology figure it out? And how can any lawmaker
write a law or regulation that can predict what will be in the
minds of consumers?
The answer is that laws, like technology, can address only a
part of the spam problem. Despite the difficult hurdles, law-
makers in many states across the United States, and indeed in
many countries around the world, have tried to do their part,
with varying levels of success.
Current Laws on Spam
First, a disclaimer: At the time this chapter was being written,
in late 2003, 35 states had antispam laws, but no federal anti-
spam law had yet been passed. In the waning days of his 
governorship of California, Gray Davis signed into law the
repeal of a weak antispam law and replaced it with one of the
strongest antispam laws in the United States. Yet, just a few
weeks later, the United States Senate passed a bill that, if
signed into law as written, would render California’s new 
law — and every other state antispam law — unenforceable.
Why the flurry of activity? In part, the volume of spam in the
first half of 2003 had skyrocketed past the dizzying heights of
previous years. By September 2003, InformationWeek maga-
zine was projecting a 400 percent increase in spam volume
over the previous year’s volumes. These huge numbers finally
caught lawmakers’ attention and suggested that the laws that
had been enacted over the preceding six years or so weren’t
working.

State-by-state
A number of states have passed antispam laws, with varying
provisions, definitions, and penalties. The most frequent pro-
visions in those laws are shown in this list:
 Opt-in or opt-out options: Opt-in laws generally require
that senders have the permission, either express or
implied through a business relationship, to send e-mail to
recipients. Opt-out laws allow senders to send e-mail with-
out permission, but typically permit recipients to ask to
be removed.
 ADV or ADLT labels: Several state laws require commer-
cial e-mail to be labeled with some variation of the letters
ADV on the Subject line, and in some cases ADLT if the
e-mail is of a sexual or pornographic nature.
 No false routing: Many laws prohibit the use of forged or
falsified routing information.
 No misleading subject: Several state laws prohibit the
use of a misleading Subject line designed to trick recipi-
ents into opening a message.
 Valid opt-out options: Several laws require each commer-
cial e-mail message to contain some type of instructions
telling recipients how to get off future mailings by that
company and requiring companies to obey consumers’
opt-out requests.
 Contact info: Many laws require that a company sending
an e-mail provide the company’s name and a physical
address or other contact information.
 No using third party’s domain name: Several laws
specifically forbid using anybody else’s domain name to
send spam without their permission. This type of law
curtails the harm inflicted on innocent third parties who
may be flooded with complaints or rejected e-mails.
Spam around the world
Although the United States Congress is still bickering over
antispam laws, governments around the world have been
quicker to take action. In the European Union (EU), a new law
Chapter 3: There Oughtta Be a Law Against Spam! 43

banning all unsolicited commercial e-mail took effect in 2002
and required all member nations of the EU to enact similar
laws before October 31, 2003, which they all did.
Huge spam problems in South Korea drove its Parliament to
enact an antispam law in 2002. However, the first attempt was
an opt-out law, which permitted spammers to send as much
e-mail as they wanted, as long as recipients were given an
opportunity to opt out of future e-mails. After spam volumes
skyrocketed, the South Korean government amended the law
to take an opt-in approach and added stiffer criminal penalties.
According to the government agency in charge of telecommu-
nications, Korean spam volumes are slowly coming down.
As of late 2003, antispam laws were also being considered in
Canada, Australia, and even, reportedly, China. Antispam
efforts are also being considered in other countries where the
spam problem has gotten out of hand, such as Japan, Taiwan,
Brazil, and a few other nations.
How to Make Spam Laws Work
Enforcing antispam laws ain’t easy, starting with the question
of who is allowed to do the enforcement. Many state antispam
laws leave enforcement up to the state’s attorney general.
This same attorney general is also chasing bank robbers, kid-
nappers, and Enron executives and is maybe fighting over a
Ten Commandments statue. This person already has an
awfully crowded list of people to sue or throw in jail, and
spammers may be pretty far down the list. (Frankly, we’re glad
that they’re busy with those other tasks. We hate spam, but
we hate kidnappers much more.)
Similarly, many antispam proposals depend on a federal
agency, such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), to
enforce the law. The FTC has excellent lawyers and investiga-
tors who are really good at big lawsuits against multimillion-
dollar organizations that hide their ill-gotten proceeds in
Swiss bank accounts. But asking the FTC to police day-to-day
spam problems is like calling in the Army to keep your neigh-
bor’s dog from digging up your yard. The FTC may be able to
muster the resources to sue the 10 biggest spammers, but it
has no prayer of stopping the hundreds or thousands of
small-time spammers.
Part I: The World of Spam 
44

Many state laws also give ISPs the right to bring lawsuits
against spammers. ISPs already have at their disposal some
legal tools to sue spammers: trademark, trespass, and com-
puter crime laws. Some ISPs have used these laws to shut
down some big spammers.
But in the last decade, ISPs have brought only a few dozen
lawsuits against spammers. Why? Because bringing a lawsuit
in federal court can cost lots of money. Spending $250,000 on
a lawsuit that recovers $50,000 in damages is quite common.
As a result, only the biggest ISPs can afford to bring these
types of lawsuits.
So how do you make an antispam law enforceable and effec-
tive? You give the people — those of us who suffer with spam
every day — the right to fight back.
Power to the People!
When average citizens are being spammed into oblivion, a
time-tested method of helping to protect them is to give them
the tools to defend themselves. Hundreds of state and federal
laws grant individuals the ability to walk down to their local
small claims court and sue the pants off whoever is bothering
them. This practice is such a part of our culture that our tele-
vision listings had, at last count, a dozen small claims court-
type television shows. (We’re not counting “Fashion Court” on
the Style Channel, where people sue their friends for crimes
against good taste.)
Consumers can sue spammers too. The Telephone Consumer
Protection Act of 1991, for example, gives everyone the ability
to sue telemarketers who all too often break many of the
detailed laws relating to telemarketing. The same law allows
recipients of unsolicited fax advertisements to sue fax spam-
mers for between $500 and $1,500 per fax! (To find out more
about suing faxers and rampant telemarketers, pick up a
copy of Internet Privacy For Dummies, by John R. Levine, 
Ray Everett-Church, Gregg Stebben, and David Lawrence. 
It’s another fine book by Wiley Publishing, Inc.)
It took only a few dozen lawsuits in small claims courts
around the nation to all but destroy the junk faxing industry.
No federal agencies or attorneys general were required! The
Chapter 3: There Oughtta Be a Law Against Spam! 45

spam crisis is tailor-made for the kind of self-help that only a
few laws across the United States give average citizens.
Why don’t more laws give consumers the right to sue spam-
mers? The sad truth is that many legislators have a hatred for
trial lawyers that blinds them to the idea that giving individu-
als a right to sue may be effective. Even the staunchest anti–
Big Government representatives in Congress seem to be more
willing to hire an army of new government lawyers than to let
a platoon of consumers run to small claims court.
If you think that the fear of trial lawyers is irrational, we agree.
The record shows that the vast majority of junk fax lawsuits
were brought by small plaintiffs, not by teams of ambulance
chasers assembling class action suits that tie up legitimate
companies in court for decades.
Never mind that the solutions to those fears are easily written
into any spam law. For example, if lawmakers fear that an anti-
spam law may generate a flood of litigation, they can easily
enough forbid class action suits or restrict lawsuits to small
claims courts, where lawyers are usually prohibited from
practicing.
The Future of Antispam Laws
The antispam legal world is constantly changing. In the few
months after this book was published, a federal law dealing
with spam may well have been signed into law. If so, Congress
may well have chosen to repeat many of the same mistakes
committed by many states and even a few other countries in
passing a law that doesn’t completely ban spam. If Congress
chooses not to ban spam, then no matter when you read this
book, you may still receive plenty of spam in your mailbox.
The reality of any antispam law is that it is only as effective as
the lawmakers who write it decide that it should be. So, if
you’re not impressed with the current state of your e-mail
inbox, the most important thing you can do is to let your
elected officials know that whatever they have done — or
haven’t done, as the case may be — is simply unacceptable.
At the end of the day, your elected officials work for you, and
as much as they may hate spammers (or even trial lawyers),
they would hate losing their jobs even more!

Ask Elmer Fudd and he’ll tell you that hunting spammers is
much like hunting wabbits. Wid a wabbit, the first place you
look is in his hole, even though you know that you’ll never
find him there. With a spammer, the first place you look is at
the From line of his spam message. Just like wid a wascally
wabbit, though, you know that you’ll never find him there.
Indeed, 99.99 percent of the time, the From line in a spam
message is fabricated and has nothing to do with the spam’s
source. This trick is just one that spammers use to try to keep
you off their trail. After you learn the ropes, however, hunting
down a spammer’s base of operations and getting him booted
off the Internet is usually a cinch.

Tracking and complaining about spammers is a pretty techni-
cal process, but it’s not hard after you get the hang of it.
Most people don’t want to bother spending the time to send
complaints, especially people who receive dozens of spam
messages a day; if we all do our part, however, we can reduce
the amount of spam that flows.
Look at E-Mail Headers
Like a piece of luggage on an airline, every e-mail message has
attached to it a little tag containing data that tells you where it
started, where it has been, and what its ultimate destination
was. In e-mail messages, this data is contained in a block of
text called the header, which looks something like this:
Return-Path: <hptimeline@yahoo.com>

[210.109.171.2]) by receiving.my-isp.com

Because most e-mail software creators think that average
users would be terrified (or bored) by all this gobbledygook,
most e-mail programs hide headers so that you never see
them. Headers are the keys to finding spammers, though, so
we tell you how to ferret out headers from most popular
e-mail programs.

First, open the offending e-mail message; to view the e-mail
header, you may need to open it in its own window. Then
follow the instructions for your e-mail program:
 The Unix programs Elm, Pine, and Mutt: Press h to turn
on the display of full headers.
 Eudora: Under the title bar are four option buttons. The
third one from the left is a box that says Blah, Blah, Blah.
(We are not making this up.) Select that box to display
the full headers.
 Hotmail: Choose Options➪Preferences➪Message Headers
from the menu bar. Then select the Full option to display
Received headers. Selecting the Advanced option dis-
plays the MIME headers, but those usually aren’t neces-
sary for spam hunting.
 Lotus Notes 4.6.x: Choose Actions➪Delivery Information.
Then cut and paste the text from the bottom box, marked
Delivery Information.
 Netscape WebMail: In the yellow field atop the message
(where the Subject, Date, From, and To information
appears), look for a small, yellow down arrow in the
lower-right corner. Click the arrow to open the yellow
field and display the full headers.
 Netscape 4.x and 7.1 and Mozilla Mail: Choose
View➪Headers➪All.
 Outlook Express: Choose File➪Properties and click the
Details tab. If you’re filing a complaint, save some time by
clicking the Message Source button, which opens a text
window with the full headers and full plain-text message
body displayed. (Spam investigators benefit from having
everything in plain text rather than with colorful fonts
and other elements.)
 Outlook 2000, 2002, and 2003: Choose View➪Options.
You see the message headers in a box at the bottom of
the Message Options window. You can copy or paste
them from that window.
 Pegasus Mail: Choose Reader➪Show All Headers. 
(You can choose the same command by pressing 
Ctrl+H instead.)
Chapter 4: Talk to the Hand ’Cuz the Spammer Don’t Care 49

Follow the flow of Received 
headers
Every time an e-mail message passes through a mail server,
that system adds a Received line. Although lots of extraneous
data is on these Received lines, they’re simple enough to read:
The mail was received from one computer by another com-
puter at a certain date and time. Each new Received line gets
added to the top of the pile, so the most recent one should be
the one that says who delivered it to your ISP.
The key pieces of information contained in every block of
headers is the IP address. An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a
unique numerical address, represented as a series of numbers
separated by “dots” (such as 192.168.128.3). Every com-
puter that connects to the Internet gets an IP address because
that’s how every other computer on the Internet knows, for
example, which computer is requesting to view a Web page
and where to send the data that is being requested.
Whenever a computer is connected to the Internet, it’s assigned
an IP address number from a pool of numbers that were allo-
cated to that ISP by the people in charge of numbers on the
Internet (read more about these “people” later in this chapter,
in the section “Don’t complain to IANA!”). If you can find a legiti-
mate IP address in an e-mail header, you can often trace the
address back to the ISP to which that number was assigned and
use it to send a complaint. The trick is to find which numbers
you can trust and which are there to throw you off the trail.
In this example, the first Received line is the latest one, and
relevant pieces of data are shown in bold:
Received: from ns.isoutsider.com (unknown
[210.109.171.2]) by receiving.my-isp.com
(8.9.3/8.9.3) with ESMTP id FSW930923; Sun, 31 Aug
2003 22:59:28 -0700 (PDT)
This line says that the mail was received by the ISP (my-isp.
com) from ns.isoutsider.com, which has the IP address
210.109.171.2. Because you can be confident that your own
ISP isn’t sending you spam, you now have the computer
named ns.isoutsider.com in your sight. Don’t stop looking
there! You can look at the next Received line to see whether
the trail goes any further:
Part I: The World of Spam 
50

Received: from adventures (CPE-
65-31-127-1.wi.rr.com [65.31.127.1]) by
ns.isoutsider.com (8.11.6/8.11.6) with ESMTP id
h7JFLKK09863; Sun, 31 Aug 2003 22:56:22 +0900
Sure enough, the trail continues. According to the next Received
line, somebody gave this spam to ns.isoutsider.com —
namely, a computer that calls itself adventures. It seems, how-
ever, that your new friend adventures is a little confused about
its name. You see, when the computer ns.isoutsider.com
received the message, it performed a lookup and found the real
name of adventures and added it to the Received header. The
real name of adventures appears to be CPE-65-31-127-1.wi.
rr.com. (We talk more about that lookup thing in the sidebar
“Nslookup in a nutshell,” later in this chapter.) Whatever its
name really is, adventures is now your prime suspect. Keep
going!
On the next Received line, you see:
Received: from billclinton.whitehouse.gov
([184.325.23.124]) by mailout.yahooo.com (Postfix)
with SMTP id 7600A32641; Sun, 31 Aug 2003 11:40:44
-0700 (PDT)
If some things about this line look funny to you, you’re right.
First, you know that Bill gave the White House back a few years
ago to the same family he got it from. Second, you’re pretty
sure that the folks at the White House have better things to
do than send you spam. Third, another domain in there,
yahooo.com, looks suspiciously like somebody didn’t know
how to spell yahoo correctly. Combined, these issues raise
some real questions about the legitimacy of this Received line.
On top of all that, it turns out that something is wrong with
Bill’s IP address. It breaks a rule that’s called, for simplicity’s
sake, “the 255 rule.” This rule says that the numbers in IP
addresses are never, never, outside the range from 0 through
255. (If you want to understand why, see the following sidebar,
“An explanation of the 255 rule.”) In the IP address 184.325.
23.124, the second number (325) is too big to be true. That
the second number breaks the 255 rule means that this IP
address is bogus. Coupling that information with the unlikely
computer name, you seem to have reached a dead end. That
leaves you with adventures, also known as CPE-65-31-127-
1.wi.rr.com, as the end of the trail.
Chapter 4: Talk to the Hand ’Cuz the Spammer Don’t Care 51

What happens, though, if the last Received line doesn’t have
any funny-looking names or has an IP address that doesn’t
violate the 255 rule? What if you see several more Received
lines? Then you keep following the Received lines backward
until you find one that doesn’t link up with the one before it.

Part I: The World of Spam 
52
An explanation of the 255 rule
You don’t need to know this rule to
be able to track down spam, but
because you’re here anyway, we
explain it. People, most of whom have
10 fingers, prefer to count in base 10;
computers, which have, at most, 2
fingers, prefer to count in base 2,
which uses only the digits 0 and 1. An
IP address is really a 32-digit base 2
number (usually referred to as 32
bits). The IP address for our Web site,
at 
www.privacyfordummies.
com, is
11010000000111110010101
001100111
Even for us computer weenies, that
kind of number is a bit challenging to
remember, so we divide the number
into four 8-bit chunks:
11010000.00011111.00101
010.01100111
Then we treat each 8-bit chunk as 
a number and translate it into its
base 10 equivalent:
208.31.42.103
The smallest value that an 8-bit
chunk can contain is 00000000,
which is 0 in base 10, and the largest
is 11111111, which is 255. A
number less than 0 or greater than
255, therefore, can’t be translated
back into an 8-bit number and can’t
be part of an IP address.

gov.) Now is the time to put the power of the Internet to work
to start tracking down the spammer. You can use the nslookup
tool, which enables you to find out whether these computer
names and IP addresses match each other. To use nslookup,
go to one of the Web-based nslookup services (try the one at
www.samspade.org/t), find the “address digger” field, and
type the name of each computer (for example, ns.isoutsider.
com). You see something like this:
ns.isoutsider.com resolves to 210.109.171.2
CPE-65-31-127-1.wi.rr.com resolves to 65.31.127.1
Error - billclinton.whitehouse.gov doesn’t exist
Because nslookup can find those first two IP addresses and
they appear to be the same as the names indicated in the
headers, you can be fairly confident that they’re accurately
represented. If you see a discrepancy, try plugging in the
number to see whether nslookup can find a name. This
process of putting in a number, getting a name, and then put-
ting in a name and getting a number, is referred to as doing for-
ward and reverse lookups. When in doubt, we usually trust
numbers over names because sometimes the same server
may answer to many names.
Because the last address appears to be fake, you can’t track
down its owner. The last verifiable mail handler on the trail
of addresses is rr.com — which is the domain name for
RoadRunner, the high-speed cable modem service owned by
Time Warner — address at CPE-65-31-127-1.wi.rr.com.
Chapter 4: Talk to the Hand ’Cuz the Spammer Don’t Care 53
Nslookup in a nutshell
All computers connected to the
Internet are assigned a unique
numerical address, the IP address. In
addition, many (but not all) comput-
ers are assigned names that are more
easily remembered by humans. So,
rather than remember 192.168.
123.45, you have to remember only
www.some-crazy-website.
com, and the Internet’s domain name
system (DNS) translates the names
into numbers for you. When you have
a number but no name, or a name but
no number, the program nslookup
(also known as name system lookup)
does a reverse lookup for you and
gets you what you need.

Investigate the Contents 
of the Spam
You should remember that you don’t want to just stop spam-
mers at the source of the spam — you also want to shut down
the operation advertised in the spam. Otherwise, the spam-
mer just moves to some other ISP and keeps on spamming.
You’re aided in this effort by the fact that most ISPs forbid
their customers to spam — from anywhere — to advertise
activities hosted on their network. Thus, even if a spammer is
using a UUNet dial-up to send out spam that advertises a Web
site being hosted by someone else, both UUNet and the site
hosting the Web site may give the spammer the boot. You
should look in the text of the spam message for any identifi-
able information or clues, such as an e-mail address or a Web
address.
Suppose that the spammer’s message contains the following
text:
Wholesale Prescription Medications
DISCREET OVERNIGHT PHARMACY!
Now get HGH, Vicodin, Sex Organ Enhancements,
Prozac, Viagr@, BustPro, Zoloft, Propecia. And
many, many more!
Just e-mail doctorfeelgood328@yahoo.com, or visit
our web site at
http://1024349897/HGH_13/specialoffer.html
In this example, the spammer is using a maildrop at Yahoo.com
and is hosting a Web site. (A maildrop is the e-mail equiva-
lent of a post office box — it’s easy to set up and provides a
good bit of anonymity if trouble arises.) But the Web page
address looks a little strange. The domain name isn’t the
usual www, and it’s not an IP address in the form you would
recognize from your research. In this case, the spammer is
using an obscure trick to mask the IP address. Luckily, most
nslookup tools can see right through the subterfuge: Plugging
1024349897 into the Obfuscated URL tool at www.samspade.
org/t tells you that it translates into 61.14.86.201, for
which further lookups reach a translation into c201.

Get Ready to Address 
Your Complaints
After you have identified all the sites a spam message is
coming from, it’s time to figure out how and where to file com-
plaints. Luckily, if you look carefully on an ISP’s Web site, you
often find information about its terms of service, or the rules
by which all its subscribers agree to abide. In many cases,
ISPs prohibit any form of spam-related activity that they can
think of and even give you an address for filing complaints.
The most common complaint address is abuse@ followed by
the domain name. Indeed, most respectable ISPs maintain an
abuse address for their domains. In some cases, however, you
may have to use a fallback address: postmaster@this-darn-
spammers-ISP.com. Although not every ISP is bright enough
to operate an abuse address, Internet e-mail protocols require
that any entity providing mail service for a domain maintain a
functioning postmaster account and that the account be read
regularly by a human being. Therefore, your default complaint
addresses usually are abuse@ or postmaster@ at the domain
in question. This method is really hit-or-miss, though, because
the domain names aren’t always where mail for those domains
is supposed to be sent.
Chapter 4: Talk to the Hand ’Cuz the Spammer Don’t Care 55
Signing up for Abuse.net service
You can use abuse.net in two differ-
ent ways: Ask it to forward your mail
to the appropriate place or ask it
what the appropriate place is and
mail it yourself.
The second way is easier: Point your
browser at www.abuse.net/look
up.phtml, type the domain in the
box on that page, and click the
Lookup button. You see the list of
addresses to use.
To use the mail forwarder, you have
to register first. To do that, send a
blank message to new@abuse.net.
You should shortly get back a confir-
mation with the Abuse.net terms of
service. Read the terms, and if you
agree to them (mostly, you agree not
to use Abuse.net to harass people),
follow the instructions in that mes-
sage to send back a message indi-
cating your agreement. After you
have done that, you can just send
your complaint to addresses like
example.com@abuse.net, and it
automatically forwards the message
as best it can. 

In truth, the best way to find the right address to send your
spam complaint is to sign up for our very own John Levine’s
Abuse.net forwarding service. (Don’t worry: It’s free! See the
nearby sidebar “Signing up for Abuse.net service.”) The serv-
ice forwards along your complaint for you. After you sign up
for Abuse.net, you just address your complaint to the domain
name shown in the spam (for example, CPE-65-31-127-1.
wi.rr.com) and add @abuse.net at the end, and Abuse.net

Do-it-yourself IP address deciphering
So you want to be a Sherlock Holmes
or Mike Hammer and learn to track
down the owner of the spam Web
site or IP address yourself? There’s
really not much to it, thanks to some
handy Web-based tools, available for
free over the Internet. Here’s how to
do it:
Browse to www.geektools.com/
whois.php and plug the IP address
into the whois tool. (No, we’re not
kidding about the name, and the tool
does exactly as its name implies: It
tells you “whois” responsible for the
IP address.)
When you plug 61.14.86.201 into
whois, you get a long listing, part of
which includes this information:

What all this means is that the con-
tact person for that IP address is an

Although you can send your com-
plaint to that person, you probably
should try the abuse and post-
master addresses first. You don’t
want to send complaints to the
administrator’s personal mailbox
unless you have to.
If whois doesn’t like the spammer-
obscured URL, you may need to use

Send Your Complaints — Nicely
Don’t transfer your anger at a spammer to the ISP. In most
cases, it’s just as angry about the spammer as you are, and
although an ISP should be pleased to receive your complaint
so that it can justify booting the spammer off the network, the
spam really isn’t the ISP’s fault. Just state your case plainly.
Here’s a good example:
Dear Administrator:
I received a piece of spam that I have attached
below. The headers appear to have originated
at RoadRunner and been relayed via ns.is
outsider.com, and it advertises both a mail-
box at Yahoo.com and a Web page at is.net.
tw. Please take appropriate action to stop this
spammer. Thanks!
Chapter 4: Talk to the Hand ’Cuz the Spammer Don’t Care 57

Make sure that you attach a complete copy of the spam,
including all headers just as you received them. The ISP wants
to do its own investigation and, without the headers, doesn’t
have anything concrete to work with. If you’re using e-mail
software that allows you to send e-mail using HTML or RTF
formatting (bold or colored text or embedded pictures, for
example), turn those options off and send your message in
plain text because those formatting features can make it diffi-
cult to read the headers and contents of the spam.
If your research is good and you were able to locate the cor-
rect addresses for filing complaints, you’re likely to receive
confirmations from some ISPs stating that they received your
mail and plan to take action. Don’t be surprised if you don’t
receive anything more than this initial acknowledgement,
however. Most abuse departments are overworked and under-
staffed; in the time it would take them to send you a personal
note to thank you and pat you on the back and let you know
what became of your complaint, they could have killed a few
more spammer accounts.
Likewise, don’t be surprised if some of your complaints
bounce back to you as undeliverable. With all due respect to
the many fine network administrators around the world, it’s
not at all uncommon for non-U.S. ISPs and corporations to be
completely ill prepared to deal with spammers and to even be
Part I: The World of Spam

Don’t fight spam with spam
One of the most common tricks
spammers use to hide their where-
abouts is to relay their messages off
the mail server of an innocent third
party. This tactic doubles the damage
because now both the receiving
system and the innocent relay
system are flooded with junk e-mail.
For any mail that gets through, many
times the flood of complaints goes
back to the innocent site because it
was made to look like the origin of the
spam. Another common trick is to
forge the headers of messages,
making it appear that the message
originated elsewhere, again provid-
ing a convenient target for the anger
of recipients and the flood of com-
plaints. This is why we point out this
information to you: If an ISP claims
innocence, don’t fight back with more
complaints. It really may be innocent.

poorly informed about basic Internet protocols, such as the
one requiring the postmaster@ address. You should give
them the benefit of the doubt, but you may need to try some
whois inquiries to see whether you can locate additional
addresses to which complaints can be sent. Meanwhile, many
countries that are relatively new to the Internet are lousy
when it comes to cleaning up messes caused by spammers.
Unfortunately, spammers know this information, so they like
to relay their spam off sites in countries like Japan, China,
Korea, and India and in Central Europe.
When complaints bounce back,
go upstream
If your complaints are bouncing back and the spam is still
flowing, it’s time to play hardball. Sometimes, ISPs aren’t as
enlightened about the problems created by spammers, but
the good news is that the company that sells the ISP its
Internet connection is probably a bit more spam-savvy.
Suppose that your new friend Infoserve in Taiwan (the com-
pany to whom you complained so nicely) hasn’t clamped
down on the spammers and your complaints are falling on
deaf ears. You still have some recourse because when data
travels from one computer to another on the Internet, the bits
of data follow a path, hopping from computer to computer
between the origin and the destination. So you can use
another tool in your Internet toolkit, traceroute, to find out
where the spammer is getting his Internet connection.
Traceroute traces the route (surprise!) of messages from one
Internet server to another.
You can use traceroute by surfing to www.geektools.com and
choosing Traceroute from the menu at the top. When you
choose traceroute, you’re presented with a long list of trace-
route sites, which is good because by tracing from different
places around the world, you can get a more accurate picture
of who a site’s upstream provider is.
Another good traceroute choice is www.tracert.com/
cgi-bin/trace.pl, which lets you automatically select sev-
eral places around the world to trace from. Running a trace
on 61.14.86.201 yields variations on the following output:

Because everybody traces from different places, the results
start out differently; in the end, though, they all seem to go
through the same place: a sequence of machines at Reach.
com and then to a machine numbered 202.148.160.18 and
then to one numbered 192.168.253.38, and then the trail
goes cold.
Doing a whois lookup on 202.148.160.18 tells you that the
contact for it is Infoserve Operations, which is probably the
same Infoserve that gave you the cold shoulder earlier. This
information would seem to suggest that is.net.tw is con-
nected via Reach.com. You have no guarantee, but it’s a good
bet that a complaint to Reach.com may get to someone who
knows how to crack some heads at Infoserve.
You could also try doing a whois lookup on 192.168.253.38
(the last computer listed in the traceroute results), but it
returns a strange response that says, in part:

Don’t complain to IANA!
Earlier in this chapter, while discussing how IP addresses
work, we referred to the “people who are in charge of num-
bers on the Internet.” The Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority (IANA) is the outfit that doles out IP addresses.
They have a few blocks of numbers, such as the block of num-
bers running from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255, that
are reserved for use in special circumstances.
One such circumstance is for use inside a corporation’s inter-
nal network. This is likely what’s happening in our earlier
traceroute example; the trace function reached the internal
boundary of the Infoserve network, which is a machine that
claims to be 192.168.253.38. For security reasons, many
organizations don’t allow traceroutes to go any further than
that outer boundary, and that’s probably why the traceroute
path went cold.
So don’t complain to IANA about spam when you run across
somebody with an IP address that whois says belongs to it!
Those numbers are reserved for anybody to use inside the
confines of its network, and the IANA doesn’t have any control
over how they’re used. You can learn more about IANA at
www.iana.net.
When All Else Fails, 
Tell It To Your ISP
If nothing else is working, you should send documentation of
your efforts to your ISP and ask it to block the spamming sites
at their routers. If the ISP isn’t responsive, take your business
to an ISP that is prepared to give you the service you deserve.

W
hen your e-mail program gets your mail, it arrives in
your inbox. With paper mail, you probably sort your
letters into categories including junk mail, bills, magazines,
and letters from real human beings. You can do the same
thing with your e-mail: Rather than leave all unread messages
in your inbox, you can move them to mail folders with names
like Newsletters and Messages from Fred. For spam, you can
move the messages directly into your Trash folder.
This chapter describes how mail folders work and how you
can create filters, which tell your e-mail program to sort
incoming messages into your folders — it’s like having your
own secretary. (You still have to fetch your own coffee,
though.) The rest of the chapters in this section detail the
exact steps to follow, depending on which e-mail program
you’re using. (If you’re not sure, see the section “Which E-Mail
Program Do You Use?” at the end of this chapter.)

receive messages, pick up a copy of The Internet For Dummies,

Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
66
Filters and folders, by themselves, don’t do a good job against
spam because spammers change the text of their messages
faster than anyone can create filters. However, filters work
hand in hand with many of the spam-filtering programs
described in Part III.
Where Messages Live: Mail
Folders and Mailboxes
Most e-mail programs come with a set of folders in which your
messages are stored, including folders like these:
 Inbox: Stores incoming messages.
 Outbox: Stores outgoing messages. Some e-mail pro-
grams move messages to a Sent Items folder after they
have been sent over the Internet.
 Deleted Items or Trash: Stores stuff you have deleted. To
get rid of the messages completely, you give a command
to empty the trash.
You can create your own folders too, with names like these:
 Personal: Stores stuff that has nothing to do with your
work and that you probably shouldn’t even be sending or
receiving from this computer, but what the heck.
 To Do: Stores messages on which you really ought to
take some kind of action one of these days — maybe
tomorrow.
 Budget: Stores all those endless memos that circulate
after each endless budget meeting, but that you need to
keep for when you need to update your department’s
budget.
Okay, those may not be the extra folders you would find
useful, but you get the general idea: You can create folders for
topics about which you want to save messages.
If you subscribe to e-mail mailing lists — whether they’re
newsletter-style announcement lists or anyone-can-talk 
discussion lists — consider creating a mail folder for each
mailing list. Your e-mail program can then move your mailing

list messages to that folder so that you can read them sepa-
rately from the rest of your messages. You can also make a
folder for certain correspondents so that you can file in one
place all mail from your mother-in-law, for example. (See how
handy the Trash folder can be?)
Moving Your Messages 
with Filters
A filter tells your e-mail program to move specific incoming
messages from your inbox to another folder. Not all e-mail
programs include filters, but most do. You create a filter by
telling the program two things:
 Which messages you want to move: You identify the part
of the message to look in (the To address, From address,
Subject line, or body of the message) and the word or
phrase to look for. If your e-mail program finds the text,
the filter takes action!
 Where to move the messages: You specify the name of
the mail folder to move the message to.
If your e-mail program lets you create filters, you can create as
many filters as you want (within reason). Considering how
many different kinds of spam are out there, that’s a good
thing!
For example, you can create a filter that moves all messages
that have the From address vpcorpfinance@megacorp.com
into your Messages From Mom folder. You can create other fil-
ters that move your New York Times, CNN, and other daily
news reports to a News folder, identifying them by their From
addresses or by words or phrases that always appear on their
Subject lines. Most important, you can create lots of spam fil-
ters that dump them directly to the trash.
Identifying Spam for Filtering
The key to using filters to get rid of spam is identifying which
messages to move to your Trash or Deleted Items folder. Here
are some ideas for useful spam filters:
Chapter 5: Mailbox Filtering in Your E-Mail Program 67

 Drug names or body parts mentioned on the Subject
line: If the Subject header of the message contains Viagra
or enhancement or mentions body parts that we don’t
usually discuss in polite conversation, chances are that
it’s spam. We have been known to include phrases like
adult webcam and orgasm in our spam filters too.
 Classic spam Subject lines: Messages with subjects con-
taining the phrases cartridge prices, mass mailer, or get
out of debt are certainly spam.
 Domain names of known spammers: If messages from
specific organizations annoy you, select for trashing all
messages where the From address ends in that domain
name (for example, manhood-enhancement.com).
 Bogus user name: Spammers sometimes send messages
with the From address friend@somedomain.com, which
aren’t likely to be from a real friend of yours, are they?
 Messages identified as spam by another spam filter: If
your ISP or mail provider uses spam-filtering software,
spam may arrive in your mailbox with ***SPAM*** or
Suspected Spam on the Subject line. If you find that the
spam filter reliably identifies messages as spam, you may
as well create a filter that trashes those messages.
In many e-mail programs, filters are case sensitive — that is,
capitalization counts. This feature (bug?) means that if you
tell a filter to look for Viagra, it doesn’t find messages that
contain viagra instead. You may need to create multiple filters,
one for each common capitalization. See the nearby sidebar,
“Sneaky ways spammers evade filters,” for more filtering
tricks and traps.
Another Approach: Filter
Everything Except Spam
Because identifying spam is hard when you’re creating filters,
you may want to do just the opposite: Identify the people you
do want to hear from and move their messages into a folder of
messages that you’re sure you want to read. For example, you
may create a bunch of filters like these:
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
68

 Friends and family: Create a folder named Friends And
Family. Create for each of your friends and family mem-
bers a filter that automatically moves messages from
these folks into the folder. These messages are the ones
that you’re sure to want to read (depending on how well
you get along with your family).
 Work: Create a folder named Coworkers or Colleagues.
Create filters for the people you work with, to move their
messages into this folder. If you work with several differ-
ent groups of people (for example, paid work and volun-
teer work), create a separate folder for each group so
that you can keep your projects straight.
 Newsletters and mailing lists: Create a folder for each
discussion mailing list you participate in and a News
folder for news. Make filters to move these messages into
their appropriate folders.
Which E-Mail Program 
Do You Use?
Exactly how to create and use filters depends on which e-mail
program you use. As spam becomes a larger issue, some pro-
grams have added rudimentary built-in spam filtering. Some
have blocked sender lists, safe sender lists, and other types of
filters.
Table 5-1 lists the programs we discuss and tells how to deter-
mine which one you’re using and which chapter of this book

Sneaky ways spammers evade filters
Spammers are smart — if they
weren’t, outraged Internet users
would have shut them down long
ago. Every time spam filterers come
up with another way to spot spam,
spammers change what they send
out. It’s like a sped-up version of
e-mail evolution.
Here are some tricks that spammers
use to prevent your filters from catch-
ing their junk messages:
 Funky capitalization: Most mail
filter programs look for the exact
capitalization you specify. If your
filter looks for spammersrus.
com on the From line, you don’t
catch messages from Spammers
Rus.com or spaMmersruS.
com.
 No text: Many spam messages
contain almost no text, just a
graphical image of text. By send-
ing the text as a graphical image,
filters can’t read the text to spot
the phrases you’re looking for.
 Wrods Speled w.r.0.n.g: People
are remarkably good at making
sense of garbled text, so it’s not
hard to garble text enough to
defeat filters and remain legible
to people.
 Hidden bogus codes: E-mail mes-
sages can contain HTML format-
ting codes, which are enclosed
in <angle brackets>. These for-
matting codes can create bold
(with the <b> code) and italics
(with <i>) text in your messages.
However, lots of codes have no
meaning in HTML, like <m> and
<n>, so your e-mail program
ignores them when displaying
messages. However, if these
meaningless codes are sprinkled
in your messages, your filters are
prevented from finding the words
you have flagged. For example,
a filter that’s looking for make
money doesn’t match a mes-
sage that contains ma<m>ke
mon<n>ey.
If you use another e-mail program, don’t despair — poke
around your e-mail program to look for features that look
like filters. Or, skip to Part III, which talks about spam-
blocking programs regardless of which e-mail program 
you use.

M
icrosoft has two major e-mail programs: Outlook
Express and Outlook. They’re similar, but not identical,
and here’s how you can tell which one you’re using:
 Outlook Express (also called OE) comes free with
Windows. We describe Outlook Express Version 6, which
comes with Windows XP. You can also download Outlook
Express 6 from the Internet Explorer Web site, at www.
microsoft.com/ie. (Outlook Express comes with most
downloadable versions of Internet Explorer too.) To run
Outlook Express, choose Start➪Outlook Express, choose
Start➪All Programs➪Outlook Express, or double-click
the Outlook Express icon on your desktop.
 Outlook is part of the Microsoft Office suite of programs,
which isn’t downloadable — you have to buy it. We
describe Outlook 2003 (which comes with Microsoft
Office 2003), Outlook 2002 (which comes with Office XP),

Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
74
and Outlook 2000 (which comes with Office 2000). To run
Outlook, choose Start➪Microsoft Office Outlook, choose
Start➪Programs➪Microsoft Office➪Microsoft Office
Outlook, or double-click the Outlook icon on your 
desktop.
This chapter describes how to set up the spam-filtering fea-
tures of both programs, which include
 Rules: The Microsoft name for filters, rules can identify
spam and send it to the trash.
 Blocked Senders list: If you get a message from anyone
on this list, the message goes right into the trash. Outlook
2000 and 2002 call this feature the Junk Senders list.
 Safe Senders list: Messages from people on this list don’t
get marked as spam, even if the message looks like spam
(Outlook 2003). Outlook 2000 and 2002 call it the
Exception list.
 Safe Recipients list: Messages addressed to these mail-
ing list addresses aren’t marked as spam (Outlook 2003).
If you aren’t familiar with how to send and receive e-mail,
maintain an address book, attach files to messages, and per-
form other tasks in Outlook and Outlook Express, see The
Internet For Dummies, by John R. Levine, Carol Baroudi, and
Margaret Levine Young, some of the same lovable authors of
this book (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Outlook Express can read and send Usenet newsgroup mes-
sages in addition to e-mail messages. (If you don’t know what
we’re talking about, Usenet is an Internet-based worldwide
system of discussion groups — see our Web page net.gurus.
com/usenet for information about how to use it.) The
Outlook Express spam-filtering features work for newsgroup
messages too.
A number of third-party spam-filtering programs are specifi-
cally designed to work with Outlook and Outlook Express
(see Chapter 11 for details).
Outlook and Outlook Express are renowned for having secu-
rity holes that allow viruses, Trojan horse programs, and
other nasty critters to hijack your computer and turn it into a
spam machine. If you use either program, you need to keep on

top of the latest security patches and always have a current,
working, and regularly updated antivirus program installed
on your computer. If you need tips and recommendations 
for avoiding viruses, pick up a copy of Internet Privacy For
Dummies (also published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Folders Are Your Friends
Outlook Express and Outlook come with a bunch of folders,
including Inbox, Outgoing Mail (or Outbox), and Deleted
Items. Recent versions of Outlook also have a Junk E-Mail 
or Junk Mail folder for use with its built-in spam-spotting 
features — you can use this folder for messages that you 
too identify as spam.
What folders do you have?
The list of folders usually appears down the left side of the
program window, as shown in Figure 6-1. If you don’t see it,
choose View➪Navigation Pane (in Outlook 2003), View➪
Folder List (in Outlook 2000 and Outlook 2002), or View➪
Layout and then select the Folder List check box (in Outlook
Express).
Figure 6-1: Outlook Express and Outlook list your mail folders down the
left side. (We added the Suspected Spam folder.)
Chapter 6: Filtering Spam in Outlook Express and Outlook 75

The general idea is to get spam out of your Inbox folder and
into the Deleted Items, Junk E-Mail, or other folder so that you
don’t have to read it.
Creating a folder for your spam
If you want to create a folder named Suspected Spam into
which you filter suspected spam messages, follow these steps:
1. On the folder list, select the folder in which you
want to store this new folder.
We usually select Local Folders, Personal Folders, or
Outlook Today.
2. Choose File➪New➪Folder from the menu bar. Or,
right-click Local Folders or Personal Folders on the
list of folders and choose New Folder from the menu
that appears. Or, press Ctrl+Shift+E.
One way or the other, you see the Create Folder dialog
box, as shown in Figure 6-2. Outlook shows the Create
New Folder dialog box. It looks pretty much the same,
but with an extra box in which you select what kind of
items the folder holds; leave the box set to Mail And
Post Items.
Figure 6-2: Create a folder for messages you identify as spam.
3. In the Folder name box, type the name for your new
folder.
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
76

4. Select Local Folders or Personal Folders on the list of
folders so that the new folder is contained in that
folder.
5. Click OK.
Your new folder appears on the folder list. To see what’s in it
(nothing yet), double-click it. If you decide later to remove or
rename it, right-click it and choose Delete or Rename from the
menu that appears. You can also drag-and-drop folders to
locations on your folder list, even inside other folders.
Turning On Junk E-Mail
Blocking (Outlook 2003)
Outlook 2003 has a new spam-spotting feature that looks at
each incoming message and assigns it a Spam Confidence
Level (SCL) number. The SCL number is based on a bunch of
factors that Microsoft is a little vague about. (See the sidebar
“Bayesian what?” in Chapter 11 to find out how advanced 
filtering techniques work.)
We don’t find that the SCL-based system Outlook 2003 uses
catches much spam. But perhaps it will improve over time.
Spam-blocking levels 
in Outlook 2003
You never see the SCL number for each message, but you can
tell Outlook 2003 to filter out messages based on their SCL
levels. You can set Outlook 2003 to throw out messages based
on each message’s SCL, setting a high, medium, or low level
depending on how nervous you are about nonspam messages
getting inadvertently trashed.
To tell Outlook what to do with messages, you can set the
Outlook junk e-mail blocking to one of four levels:
 No Automatic Filtering: Turns SCL-based blocking off.
We recommend this level if you love reading spam or if
you’re using another program to spot spam (like one of
the programs we describe in Chapter 11).
Chapter 6: Filtering Spam in Outlook Express and Outlook 77

 Low: The default setting, which spots e-mail that has a
moderate to high SCL number and moves it to your Junk
E-Mail folder.
 High: Junks e-mail that has a low, medium, or high SCL
number and may catch real messages too. Only messages
with very low SCL numbers get through. Be sure to check
the messages in your Junk E-Mail folder regularly if you
use this setting, to check for false positives (good e-mail
misidentified as spam).
 Safe Lists Only: Turns off SCL-based blocking. Junks all
e-mail except messages from people on your Safe Senders
list or Safe Recipients list. See the section “Letting Mail
from Your Buddies Through” to find out how to add
people to these lists.
Setting Outlook 2003
to block your spam
To set your junk e-mail blocking level, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options from the menu.
You see the Options dialog box with the Preferences
tab selected.
2. On the Preferences tab, click the Junk E-Mail button.
You see the Junk E-Mail Options dialog box, as shown
in Figure 6-3.
3. Select the No Automatic Filtering, Low, High, or Safe
Lists Only option to set your junk e-mail filtering
level.
4. If you want your junk mail to be deleted completely
rather than moved to the Junk E-Mail folder, select
the check box at the bottom of the dialog box.
We don’t recommend this setting if you’re using the
high level of spam-blocking.
5. Click OK and then OK again to dismiss both dialog
boxes.
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
78

Figure 6-3: Turning on the Outlook 2003 spam-blocking feature.
An advantage to letting Outlook move spam to the Junk E-Mail
folder rather than immediately delete it is that the Outlook
SCL isn’t perfect. (No spam-identification system is perfect!)
From time to time, or if you were expecting a message that
never came, you can look over the messages that Outlook
thinks are spam by opening your Junk E-Mail folder. See the
section “Reviewing Your Spam,” later in this chapter, to find
out how to look at and then empty this folder.
When Outlook 2003 spots an incoming piece of spam, you see
the warning message shown in Figure 6-4.
Figure 6-4: Spam alert!
If you’re just starting to use spam-blocking in Outlook 2003,
we suggest that you let the program move suspected spam
into the Junk E-Mail folder for several weeks and monitor
what it moves. If you don’t see any false positives after a
couple of weeks, follow the steps in this section again and
select the check box in Step 4.
Chapter 6: Filtering Spam in Outlook Express and Outlook 79

Telling Outlook 2003
who your friends are
Outlook 2003 junk e-mail blocking may catch messages that
you really want to read (called false positives). One way of
overriding the program’s SCL-based ranking system is to
specify the addresses and domains of your buddies and 
work associates — or any address from which you never
want messages to be considered as spam.
You can ensure that messages from your friends and coworkers
don’t get classified as spam, even if they do talk about mort-
gages, debt reduction, or the enlargement of various body
parts, by adding them to your Safe Senders list. Here’s how:
1. Open a message from one of these people.
2. Choose Actions➪Junk E-Mail➪Add Sender to Safe
Senders List.
You see a message confirming the addition.
3. Click OK.
You can see the Safe Senders list by choosing Tools➪Options,
clicking the Junk E-Mail button, and clicking the Safe Senders
tab in the Junk E-Mail Options dialog box that appears. You
can add the address of each of your buddies by clicking Add,
typing the address, and clicking OK.
Outlook maintains a Contacts list (address book, actually),
which you can see by choosing Go➪Contacts or pressing
Ctrl+3. (Choose Go➪Mail or press Ctrl+1 to get back to your
mail.) On the Safe Senders tab in the Junk E-Mail Options
dialog box, a check box at the bottom of the dialog box tells
Outlook to automatically treat all e-mail addresses on your
Contacts list as safe senders. We recommend that you leave
this check box selected.
Telling Outlook 2003 which 
mailing lists you’re on
If you subscribe to mailing lists or e-mail newsletters, Outlook
2003 may decide that their messages are spam. Many news-
letters use lots of graphics and sales talk and could easily
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
80

earn a high SCL ranking. To prevent your mailing list and
newsletter messages from disappearing in the Junk E-Mail
folder, add their addresses to your Safe Recipients list.
Unlike the Safe Senders list, the Safe Recipients list looks at
the address on the To line of incoming messages. When you
get messages from a mailing list or e-mail newsletter, the
address of the newsletter usually appears on the To line of
the message. For example, if you subscribe to a mailing list
that discusses raising chickens at home, messages may be
addressed to hens-at-home@gurus.com. To tell Outlook 2003
that the current message from a mailing list isn’t spam, choose
Actions➪Junk E-Mail➪Add Recipient to Safe Recipients List.
You can review the entries on the list by choosing Tools➪
Options, clicking the Junk E-Mail button, and clicking the 
Safe Recipients tab.
Turning On Junk E-Mail
Blocking (Outlook 2000 
and Outlook 2002)
Neither Outlook 2000 nor Outlook 2002 has the more sophisti-
cated Outlook 2003 ways of spotting spam; they identify spam
only by the address of the sender or addressee or by words
or phrases on the Subject line or in the text of a message.
Although the following sections tell you how to tell Outlook
the addresses of spam, first you need to turn this feature on.
To tell Outlook 2000 or Outlook 2002 to move messages to
your Deleted Items folder based on the sender’s address,
follow these steps:
1. Click to select Inbox on your folder list.
2. Click the Organize button on the toolbar.
The Ways To Organize Inbox pane appears in the
upper-right part of the Outlook window.
3. Click the Junk E-Mail link.
The pane shown in Figure 6-5 appears in the upper-
right part of the Outlook window. The pane shows
what Outlook plans to do with messages it identifies
Chapter 6: Filtering Spam in Outlook Express and Outlook 81

as junk. The default is to display these messages 
in gray.
Figure 6-5: Junking spam in Outlook 2000 or 2002.
4. Click in the Color box and choose Move from the
menu that appears.
The other box changes to show the name of the folder
where Outlook moves spam: your Junk E-Mail folder.
5. Click the Turn On button.
If you don’t already have a Junk E-Mail folder, Outlook
offers to make you one: Click OK and click the No
button to avoid creating a shortcut to it. Now the
message says New Junk messages will be moved
to Junk E-Mail.
6. Click the Organize button again to close the Ways To
Organize Inbox pane.

Fooling with Filters.txt (Outlook 2000
and Outlook 2002)
Outlook 2000 and 2002 come with a
list of words and phrases that appear
in spam, and where to look for them,
in the form of a text file full of rules.
Look for the file Filters.txt in your
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\
Office or C:\Program Files\Microsoft
Office\Office10\1033 folder. (If you
can’t find the file in those folders,
search your hard disk for the file-
name.). The rules in Filters.txt look
like this:
From is blank
Subject contains “advertisement”
Body contains “money back” 
Body contains “cards accepted”
You can also create your own rules to
extend the spam-spotting abilities in
Outlook, as explained in the section
“Creating Rules to Trash Spam,” later
in this chapter.

See the section “Creating a new rule in Outlook 2000 or
Outlook 2002,” at the end of this chapter, to find out how to
add the addresses of your friends to your Exception list so
that filters don’t classify their messages as spam.
Blocking Messages by Sender
Both Outlook and Outlook Express can filter out messages
from specific addresses. To block messages from a specific
address, follow these steps:
1. Open a message from the address.
2. In the window that displays the message, choose
Message➪Block Sender (in Outlook Express),
Actions➪Junk E-Mail➪Add Sender To Blocked
Senders List (in Outlook 2003), or Actions➪Junk 
E-Mail➪Add To Junk Senders list (in Outlook 2000
and Outlook 2002).
You may see a message confirming that the address
has been added to your Blocked Senders or Junk
Senders list.
3. If you see a confirmation message, click OK.
The message you opened is still in your inbox; the pro-
gram will block future messages, but doesn’t do any-
thing about this one. Just delete it!
Viewing your Blocked Senders list
You can look at or edit the Blocked Senders list later, in case
you add a friend accidentally or you want to type a bunch of
spammer addresses. The commands are different for Outlook
Express and Outlook:
 Outlook Express: Choose Tools➪Message Rules➪
Blocked Senders List from the menu bar in the main
Outlook Express window. You see the Message Rules
dialog box with the Blocked Senders tab selected, as
shown in Figure 6-6.
 Outlook 2003: Choose Tools➪Options and select the
Junk E-Mail option on the Preferences tab. Click the
Blocked Senders tab, which looks much like Figure 6-6.
Chapter 6: Filtering Spam in Outlook Express and Outlook 83

 Outlook 2000 and Outlook 2002: Select Inbox on your
folder list. Click the Organize button on the toolbar. The
Ways To Organize Inbox pane appears in the upper-right
part of the Outlook window. Click the Junk E-Mail link.
Click the Click Here link that offers to show you options.
Click the Edit Junk Senders link to display the small Edit
Junk Senders dialog box.
Figure 6-6: You can block all incoming messages from specific addresses.
Messages from any addresses on your Blocked Senders list
are shunted straight to your Deleted Items or Junk E-Mail
folder (unless you use Outlook 2003 and have selected the
check box to delete these messages immediately, as described
in the preceding section).
You can add more addresses by clicking Add and typing or
pasting the address in the dialog box that appears. If you
decide to accept messages from an address after all, you can
delete it from the list by choosing the address and clicking
Remove. To edit an entry on the list, select it and click either
the Modify or Edit button.
Blocking messages from 
entire domains
The Blocked Senders list can include entire domains (a domain
is the part of an e-mail address after the @). For example, if
you don’t want to receive any mail from the White House,
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
84

you could block all messages that come from anything@
whitehouse.gov. Follow these steps to block all messages
from an entire domain:
1. Display the Blocked Senders list, as described in the
preceding section.
2. Click the Add button.
Outlook Express displays the Add Sender dialog box,
as shown in Figure 6-7. Outlook shows a smaller dialog
box, but you get the idea.
Figure 6-7: If you’re just sick of all the messages you get from a certain
domain, you can do something about it.
3. Type the domain name and click OK.
In Outlook Express, leave the Mail Messages radio
button selected. When you click OK, the new entry
appears on your Blocked Senders list. An at-sign (@)
may appear at the beginning of the entry; that’s okay.
Reviewing Your Spam
If you have just set up or updated spam-blocking features or
mail-filtering rules (described later in this chapter), be sure to
look through the messages that Outlook Express or Outlook
has identified as spam. You can easily create a rule that is
too broad and creates false positives — perfectly innocent
messages that may have been mislabeled as spam.
To look in your Deleted Items, Junk E-Mail, Suspected Spam,
or whatever folder you shunt spam into, double-click it on the
folder list. The list of messages in that folder appears. Scroll
through the messages; the unread messages appear in bold.
(Spam you never saw should all appear in bold.)
Chapter 6: Filtering Spam in Outlook Express and Outlook 85

If you see any good messages, drag them into your Inbox
folder. Then look at the message and at your message rules to
figure out how it got tagged as spam, and fix your rules.
If you’re looking at your Junk E-Mail folder in Outlook 2003,
Outlook may have assigned the wrong SCL level to a message,
causing it to end up in with the spam. You can tell Outlook
that it guessed wrong about this message being spam. Follow
these steps:
1. With the message selected or open, choose Actions➪
Junk E-Mail➪Mark As Not Junk (or press Ctrl+Alt+J).
You see the Mark As Not Junk dialog box, as shown in
Figure 6-8.
Figure 6-8: If this message isn’t spam, can Outlook 2003 assume that no
other messages from this sender are spam, either?
2. If messages from this sender should never be consid-
ered spam, leave the top check box selected.
For example, if the message was from president@
whitehouse.gov, you may want to leave the check
box selected so that you can always read these mes-
sages. Or, depending on your politics, you may want
all messages from this address to be deep-sixed — in
that case, deselect the top check box (so that it doesn’t
contain a check).
If this check box contains a check mark, Outlook adds
this address to your Safe Senders list.
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
86

3. If the message was addressed to a mailing list
address (if a mailing list address, rather than your
own e-mail address, appears on the To line), select
the check box for the mailing list address in the
Always Trust E-Mail Sent To The Following
Addresses list.
If the message was sent to several addresses, each
address appears on the list with its own check box. If a
check box on this list contains a check mark, Outlook
adds the address to your Safe Recipients list.
4. Click OK.
Outlook adds the addresses to the appropriate lists.
Blocking Web Bugs Disguised
as Graphics (Outlook 2003)
Originally, e-mail contained only boring, unformatted text, but
those days are long gone. Lots of e-mail messages contain
graphic files, both to add pictures to the messages and to pro-
vide formatting elements, like logos, headlines, and borders.
However, graphics in e-mail messages have a dark side.
Spammers sometimes include specially coded links to pic-
tures that are stored in files back on their file servers. When
you open the message, your e-mail program fetches the pic-
ture to display by using the special code linked to your e-mail
address and — voila! — the spammer knows that you have
read the message and that your address is good. The result?
You get lots more spam. This type of trick graphic is some-
times called a Web bug.
Outlook 2003 turns off the automatic display of all pictures in
e-mail messages to prevent just this kind of tracking, using its
Automatic Picture Blocking feature. Neither Outlook Express
nor earlier versions of Outlook include picture blocking (and
neither do most other e-mail programs). If you don’t have
Outlook 2003, you still may want to read it to understand how
it works.
Chapter 6: Filtering Spam in Outlook Express and Outlook 87

How Outlook 2003 
displays pictures
With automatic picture blocking turned on (the default setting),
pictures in e-mail messages appear as little red Xs. A message
at the top also lets you know that pictures weren’t down-
loaded. Figure 6-9 shows a message with its pictures surgically
removed.
Figure 6-9: Instructions at the top of this message window tell you how to
download pictures that Outlook 2003 has blocked.
If you want to see the pictures in the message, click the 
pictures-missing notice at the top of the message. Or, right-
click a red X in the message. Then choose Download Pictures
from the menu that appears. Outlook displays the graphics
that were missing.
Luckily, you can tell Outlook to download the pictures in
messages from folks you trust. If a message with an attached
picture arrives from someone on your Safe Senders or Safe
Recipients list, Outlook downloads the pictures anyway.
Outlook figures that because you know these folks, pictures
from them are safe. Just add addresses to your Safe Senders
list (for individuals) or Safe Recipients list (for newsletters
and mailing lists whose messages arrive addressed to the list
address rather than to you). When the message is open, click
in the pictures-missing message and select Add Sender To
Safe Senders List.
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox

Turning off the Outlook 2003
picture-blocking feature
If you would rather bag the whole picture-blocking feature and
not worry about Web bugs, you can. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options in the main Outlook window.
You see the Options dialog box.
2. Click to select the Security tab.
3. Click the Change Automatic Download Settings
button.
You see the Automatic Picture Download Settings
dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-10. Normally, all four
check boxes are selected.
Figure 6-10: Turning off automatic picture blocking in Outlook 2003.
4. If you want Outlook 2003 to download all pictures
automatically, click to deselect the first check box.
This action may allow spammers to track you, but it
also allows you to get nicely formatted messages from
people who aren’t on your Contacts list or Safe
Senders list. We recommend leaving this check box
selected, but it’s up to you.
5. If you don’t even want Outlook to download pictures
from people on your Safe Senders, Safe Recipients,
or Contacts lists, clear the second check box.
This choice looks a little paranoid to us, frankly.
Chapter 6: Filtering Spam in Outlook Express and Outlook 89

6. If you have set up security zones in Internet Explorer
and you don’t even want Outlook to download pic-
tures from sites in your trusted zone, clear the third
check box.
No one we know has ever bothered to configure a
Trusted Zone list, which is part of Internet Explorer.
To take a look at it, switch to Internet Explorer, choose
Tools➪Options, select the Security tab, click the
Trusted Sites icon, and click the Sites button. If you
see sites you don’t trust, select them and click the
Remove button. (We found that free.aol.com had
added itself to our list, and we removed it immediately.)
7. If you don’t want Outlook to bother warning you
when you’re working with messages that contain
attachments, select the fourth check box.
We recommend leaving this check box selected.
8. Click OK and then click OK again to make all those
dialog boxes go away.
Sorting Spam Directly 
into the Trash
You can create rules that tell Outlook Express or Outlook 
to sort some messages directly into the Delete Items, Junk 
E-Mail, or other folder. Some of the third-party spam-filtering
programs described in Chapter 11 add tags to incoming mes-
sages to indicate that the messages are probably spam. You
can create rules to sort these tagged messages in the Junk 
E-Mail, Deleted Items, or other folder.
First, create a folder if you don’t already have one for spam,
as described in the section “Creating a Folder for Your Spam,”
earlier in this chapter. Then you’re ready to create spam 
filters!
If you use Outlook 2003, you may as well use the Junk E-Mail
folder that you already have — there’s no need to create a
new folder.
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
90

Creating Rules to Trash Spam
You can create a bunch of rules that tell Outlook Express or
Outlook what a particular spam message looks like and what
to do with it — mainly, to get it the heck out of your inbox!
The e-mail program applies each rule to each message as it
arrives in your inbox; and, by creating rules that match the
headers or text of spam messages, you can deflect spam from
your inbox into another folder.
If you use any of the Outlook junk e-mail filtering features,
Outlook tries to spot spam and move it into the Junk E-Mail
folder. Outlook may miss much of it, though. Rules allow you
to specify additional spam to move.
Rules don’t work with Web-based mailboxes, like Hotmail.
Rules don’t work with IMAP-based mailboxes either (these
mailboxes, used mainly in large organizations, allow you to
read mail on the mail server without downloading it for 
storage on your computer).
You can make pretty fancy rules. For example, you can specify
that if a message contains the phrase low interest mortgage or
debt reduction and it’s not from your bank, it should be deleted.
You can make lots of rules, one for each type of spam you get.
The more you make, the more spam never hits your inbox.
See the section in Chapter 5 about identifying spam for filter-
ing for suggestions about how to specify which messages are
spam.
Creating a new rule 
in Outlook Express
To work with rules, choose Tools➪Message Rules➪Mail to
display the Message Rules dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-11.
If you haven’t created any rules yet, Outlook Express displays
the New Mail Rule dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-12. From
the Message Rules dialog box, click the New button to create a
new rule.
Chapter 6: Filtering Spam in Outlook Express and Outlook 91

Figure 6-11: You can create, modify, and delete mail-filtering rules in
Outlook Express.
Figure 6-12: To create a mail-filtering rule, you tell Outlook Express the
conditions that messages must match and what you want
the program to do with matching messages.
The New Mail Rule dialog box contains four boxes in which
you specify information about the rule:
 Select The Conditions For Your Rule: You specify which
parts of the message Outlook Express should look at in
determining to which messages to apply the rule. You
can select the From line, Subject line, message body, To
line, CC line, priority, mail account, size, attachment, and
security setting. Or, you can choose to apply the rule to
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
92

all messages. Strangely, you don’t specify the text,
address, or other information here; you provide this
information in Box 3. Go figure.
 Select The Actions For Your Rule: You specify what
Outlook Express should do when a message matches a
condition. You can move a message to a folder, copy it to
a folder, delete it, forward it, reply to it, or mark it as
highlighted, flagged, read, or unread. You can also tell
Outlook Express not to download the message from your
mail server or to delete it from the mail server without
downloading it.
 Rule Description: This box shows the rule as you create
it. You specify details about the rule, such as what text to
look for or which folder to move messages to, by clicking
underlined links in the description.
 Name Of The Rule: You can name the rule. (If you don’t,
Outlook Express comes up with creative names, like
New Mail Rule #1.)
Follow these steps to create a rule to filter out spam:
1. In Box 1, Select The Conditions For Your Rule, select
the check box for the part of the message that identi-
fies the message as spam.
For example, if you want to block all messages that
contain the phrase low interest mortgage on the
Subject line, select the second check box, Where 
The Subject Line Contains Specific Words.
2. In Box 2, Select The Actions For Your Rule, select the
first check box, Move It To The Specified Folder.
Box 3 now shows text based on your choice in Boxes
1 and 2. For example, if you selected the Subject Line
check box in Box 1, Box 3 says
Apply this rule after this message arrives.
When the Subject line contains specific
words, move it to the specified folder.
3. In Box 3, Rule Description, click the Contains
Specified Words link to specify the word or phrase
to match.
You see the Type Specific Words dialog box, as shown
in Figure 6-13.
Chapter 6: Filtering Spam in Outlook Express and Outlook 93

Figure 6-13: Which word or phrase appears in spam?
4. Type the word or phrase that appears in the spam
you want to trash. Click the Add button.
For example, type low-interest in the box. When you
click the Add button, the Words box shows the words
you’re looking for.
5. If you want the rule to look for another phrase too,
repeat Step 4.
You may want the same rule to look for other loan and
mortgage spam messages, so you can type debt
reduction and click the Add button and then type
reduced interest and click Add again. The Words box
shows the whole list of words and phrases you want
the rule to match.
6. Click OK to return to the New Mail Rule dialog box.
Box 3 shows the list of phrases the rule matches. But
you still haven’t told the rule what to do with mes-
sages that contain these phrases on the Subject line.
7. Click the Specified link in Box 3.
Outlook Express displays the Move dialog box, show-
ing a list of your folders (as shown in Figure 6-14).
8. Select the folder and click OK.
We like to move spam to a Suspected Spam folder,
which we look through from time to time, to check for
good messages that may have been misidentified as
spam. Your other option is to move the messages
directly into the Deleted Items folder.
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
94

Figure 6-14: Where do you want to put your spam?
9. Click to select the Stop Processing More Rules check
box in Box 2 (Select The Actions For Your Rule).
The phrase and stop processing more rules appears at
the end of your rules description, telling Outlook
Express that, after it has moved a message once, it’s
done applying rules to that message; it’s time to go on
to the next message.
10. In Box 4, Name Of The Rule, type a name for this
rule.
You can use any name; you’re the only person who
sees it. Type something that makes finding the rule
easy if you decide to change it later, such as loan
spams.
11. Click OK.
Outlook Express stores the rule and you return to the
Message Rules dialog box.
Some spam-tagging programs (like POPFile, which is
described in Chapter 11) add a header to each message that
indicates whether the message is spam. POPFile can add a
header line that says X-Text-Classification:spam to sus-
pected spam messages. However, Outlook Express can’t filter
messages based on the X-Text-Classification header. Instead,
you need to tell POPFile (or whatever spam filter you use) to
use Subject-line tagging, and apply filters based on the [spam]
tag or other tag added to the Subject lines of suspected junk
messages.
Chapter 6: Filtering Spam in Outlook Express and Outlook 95

Creating a new rule
in Outlook 2003
To work with rules in Outlook, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Rules and Alerts from the main
Outlook window.
If you have Outlook configured to get messages from a
Hotmail account, you see a message warning you that
rules don’t work with Hotmail; just click OK.
The Rules and Alerts dialog box opens.
2. If the Manage Alerts tab is selected, click to select
the E-Mail Rules tab.
You see the dialog box shown in Figure 6-15.
3. If you use Outlook to check more than one mail
account, set the Apply Changes To This Folder box to
the Inbox folder of the account to which you want
these rules to apply.
Figure 6-15: Outlook 2003 lets you set up lots of rules to spot spam.
If you set up rules in a previous version of Outlook, you can
import them into Outlook 2003 by clicking the Options button
on the E-Mail Rules tab and then clicking the Import Rules
button.

To create a new rule, click the New Rule button (logically
enough!). You see the Rules Wizard dialog box, as shown in
Figure 6-16. The exact steps depend on whether you want to
identify some spam messages by the From or To address or
by words on the Subject line.
Figure 6-16: Outlook 2003 has templates and a wizard to help you create
rules to separate spam from real messages.
In the Rules Wizard dialog box, leave the Start Creating A Rule
From A Template option selected. For sorting spam, one of the
templates usually fits the bill.
Trapping spam based on the From or To address
(Outlook 2003)
Follow these steps to create a new rule to identify spam by its
To or From address:
1. In the Stay Organized section of the Step 1 box, click
to select the option Move Messages From Someone
To A Folder to match spam from a specific address.
Or, select Move Messages Sent To A Distribution List
To A Folder to match spam that comes with a bogus
address on the To line.
The Step 2 box now contains text based on your
choice. If you selected Move Messages From Someone
To A Folder, the Step 2 box says
Chapter 6: Filtering Spam in Outlook Express and Outlook 97

Apply this rule after the message arrives /
from people or distribution list / move it
to the specified folder
(Okay, so punctuation isn’t Microsoft’s long suit.) If
you selected Move Messages Sent To A Distribution
List To A Folder, it shows more or less the same 
message.
2. Click the People Or Distribution List link in the
Step 2 box.
You see the Rule Address dialog box (see Figure 6-17).
Figure 6-17: Outlook 2003 wants to know the address of a spammer.
3. Type the address in the From box near the bottom of
the dialog box and click OK.
If you selected Move Messages From Someone To A
Folder in the Step 1 box, Outlook looks for these
addresses on the From line of incoming messages. If
you selected Move Messages Sent To A Distribution
List To A Folder in the Step 1 box, Outlook looks at the
To line.
When you click OK, you return to the Rules Wizard
dialog box and the People Or Distribution List link is
replaced with the address you typed.
4. Click the Specified link in the Step 2 box, select the
Junk E-Mail folder, and click OK.
If you have created another folder to hold suspected
spam, select that folder instead.
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox

5. Click the Finish button.
The rule appears in the Rules and Alerts dialog box —
it’s ready to intercept spam!
If you want the opportunity to tweak the settings for your
rule, click the Next button rather than Finish in Step 5. The
Rules Wizard shows you a series of dialog boxes in which you
can specify the details of the rule, as shown in Figure 6-18. You
can leave these settings alone, or you can scroll down the list
of options and make changes.
Figure 6-18: Tweaking the Rules Wizard settings.
Trapping spam based on words on the Subject line or in
the body of the message (Outlook 2003)
Follow these steps to create a new rule to identify spam by its
subject or text:
1. In the Stay Organized section of the Step 1 box,
select the option Move Messages With Specific
Words In The Subject To A Folder.
The Step 2 box now contains text based on your
choice:
Apply this rule after the message arrives
with specific words in the subject
move it to the specified folder
Chapter 6: Filtering Spam in Outlook Express and Outlook 99

2. Click the Specific Words link in the Step 2 box.
You see the Search Text dialog box, as shown in
Figure 6-19.
Figure 6-19: Typing typical spam phrases in Outlook 2003.
3. In the top box in the Search Text dialog box, type a
word or phrase that appears on the Subject line of
spam and click the Add button.
Type words that appear only in spam, because
Outlook moves all messages with these words out of
your Inbox.
4. Keeping typing words or phrases and clicking the
Add button until you have entered a list of text that
appears only in spam.
5. Click OK.
When you click OK, you return to the Rules Wizard
dialog box and the Specific Words link is replaced with
a list of the terms you typed.
6. Click the Specified link in the Step 2 box, select the
Junk E-Mail folder, and click OK.
If you have created another folder to hold suspected
spam, select that folder instead.
7. Click the Next button.
The wizard displays a list of conditions that it plans to
use to determine which messages match the rule. The
first item, With Specific Words In The Subject, is
selected.
8. If you want the rule to look in the body of messages
for these words also, scroll down the list of condi-
tions in the Step 1 box and select the With Specific
Words In The Subject Or Body option so that a check
mark appears in the box.
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
100

Chances are, if a word or phrase identifies spam on
the Subject line of messages, you don’t want to read
messages with those terms in the body of the message
either.
9. Click Finish.
The rule appears in the Rules and Alerts dialog box.
Trapping spam based on the X-Text-Classification or
other spam-tagging header
Some third-party spam programs examine your messages
before they get to your e-mail program, adding a special
header line indicating that the message is probably spam.
(See Chapter 11 to find out how this process works.) For
example, POPFile adds a header line with the text X-Text-
Classification followed by a colon, a space, and the name
of the bucket you created for spam.
Outlook 2003 can filter messages based on this header. Create
a new rule and select Start From A Blank Rule rather than use
a template. Click the Next button to see the box labeled Which
Conditions Do You Want To Check. Select the With Specific
Words In The Message Header link and then select the Specific
Words link in the Step 2 box. Type X-Text-Classification: spam
(or whatever the name of your suspected spam bucket is) as
the text to match.
Fooling with Outlook 2003 rules
On the E-Mail Rules tab of the Rules and Alerts dialog box, you
can tell Outlook to run all your rules right away — that is,
apply all the rules against the messages that are already in
your Inbox. Click the Run Rules Now button.
You can also edit existing rules by selecting the rule and click-
ing the Change Rule button, or delete rules by clicking the
Delete button.
Creating a new rule in Outlook
2000 or Outlook 2002
Rules in Outlook 2000 and Outlook 2002 appear when you
choose Tools➪Rules Wizard from the menu. The Rules Wizard
dialog box appears with a list of your mail-sorting rules, and
two rules are already in place:
Chapter 6: Filtering Spam in Outlook Express and Outlook 101

 Junk E-Mail Rule: This rule moves mail from people on
your Junk Senders list to your Junk E-Mail list. (If this
rule doesn’t appear, refer to the section “Turning On Junk
E-Mail Blocking (Outlook 2000 and Outlook 2002),” earlier
in this chapter, to create it.)
 Exception List: This rule tells Outlook not to use the Junk
E-Mail Rule on messages from your friends — that is,
people whose addresses appear on your Exception list.
You have no need to create rules to identify spam by the
address of the sender: Just add the addresses to your Junk
Senders list, as described in the section “Blocking Messages
by Sender,” earlier in this chapter. But rules can be handy for
identifying spam by words or phrases on the Subject line or in
the text of the message.
Making a new rule (Outlook 2000 and Outlook 2002)
Follow these steps to create a rule to filter out spam:
1. Choose Tools➪Rules Wizard from the menu.
You see the Rules Wizard dialog box.
2. Click the New button.
The Rules Wizard has a list of things you can do to a
message.
3. Select the option Move Messages Based On Content.
The Rules description box changes to read:
Apply this rule after the message arrives
with specific words in the subject or body
move it to the specified folder
4. Click the Specific Words link.
The Search Text dialog box appears (refer to Figure
6-19 in the preceding section).
5. In the top box in the Search Text dialog box, type a
word or phrase that appears on the Subject line or in
the body of spam messages and click the Add
button.
Type words that appear only in spam, because
Outlook moves all messages with these words out of
your Inbox.
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox

6. Keeping typing words or phrases and clicking the
Add button until you have entered a list of text that
appears only in spam.
7. Click OK.
When you click OK, you return to the Rules Wizard
dialog box and the Specific Words link is replaced with
a list of the terms you typed.
8. Click the Specified link in the Rule description box,
select the Junk E-Mail folder, and click OK.
If you have created another folder to hold suspected
spam, select that folder instead.
9. Click Finish.
The new rule appears in the Rule Wizard dialog box.
If you want to customize your rule, select it and click the
Modify button. (You can’t modify the Junk E-Mail or Exception
List rules that Outlook created.) Rather than click Finish when
you’re done, you can click the Next button to see other options.
To run your rules against the messages in your Inbox (or
other folder), click the Run Now button, select the rule or
rules to apply, select the folder, and click the Run Now button.
Whitelisting your friends (Outlook 2000 and 
Outlook 2002)
When you start filtering your messages, you need to make
sure that messages from your buddies don’t get caught by
your spam-filtering rules. You can make a rule that Outlook
applies first, telling it that if the sender is in your address
book, not to apply any more rules to the message. Follow
these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Rules Wizard and click the New
button to start a new rule.
2. Select the options Start From A Blank Rule and
Check Messages When They Arrive and then click
the Next button.
3. Select Where Sender Is In A Specified Address Book
or From People Or Distribution List on the list on the
next page of the wizard so that a check mark
appears in its check box.
Chapter 6: Filtering Spam in Outlook Express and Outlook 103

4. Click the A Specified Address Book or People Or
Distribution List link and specify your buddies. Click
the Next button.
In Outlook 2002, you select an entire address book. 
In Outlook 2000, you select individuals from your
address book.
5. Select the option Stop Processing More Rules on the
list on the next page of the wizard so that a check
mark appears in its check box.
This action tells Outlook not to apply the spam-filtering
rules to these messages.
6. Click the Finish button.
You may see a message telling you that the rule 
is processed only when Outlook is running; if so,
click OK.
7. In the Rules Wizard box, make sure that this rule
appears first: if not, select it and click the Move Up
button.
This rule needs to happen first, before Outlook gets
around to applying the other rules.

Filtering Spam in Netscape
and Mozilla Mail
In This Chapter
 Turning on the Netscape and Mozilla Mail built-in junk mail controls
 Creating folders for your spam
 Creating message filters that move spam directly into the trash
N
etscape was one of the earliest Web browsers, and for
years it has come bundled with a respectable e-mail pro-
gram, Netscape Mail. Versions of Netscape Mail up to 7.0 don’t
have strong anti-spam features, although they do enable you
to create filters so that you can do some spam filtering on
your own.
However, here’s great news: Netscape Mail 7.1 added a power-
ful Bayesian anti-spam system that makes third-party spam fil-
ters unnecessary. If you use Netscape Mail 7.1, you can
eliminate lots of spam by just turning on its spam feature.
This chapter describes Netscape 7.1, which you can download
for free from browsers.netscape.com. An open source (non-
commercial) version named Mozilla is also available (at www.
mozilla.org), and this chapter describes Version 1.5. Because
the two programs are so similar, we refer to them both as
Netscape/Mozilla Mail.
If you have an earlier version of either program, upgrade right
away so that you can take advantage of the new spam filters.
The main Netscape Mail window is shown in Figure 7-1. If
you aren’t familiar with how to send and receive e-mail with
Netscape and Mozilla, see The Internet For Dummies, 9th Edition

Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
106
(written by John R. Levine, Margaret Levine Young, and Carol
Baroudi and published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.). To open
Netscape or Mozilla Mail from the Netscape or Mozilla brow-
ser window, choose Window➪Mail & Newsgroups from the
browser’s menu bar.
Figure 7-1: Netscape 7 includes a browser and a mail program that has
spam filtering built right in.
Netscape/Mozilla Mail has several privacy-related settings and
features you can use to keep Netscape from coughing up your
e-mail address to unknown Web sites and potential spammers.
Instructions for using those features are in Internet Privacy
For Dummies (written by John R. Levine, Ray Everett-Church,
Greg Stebben, and David Lawrence and published by Wiley
Publishing, Inc.).
Using the Netscape/Mozilla Mail
Junk Mail Controls
Netscape/Mozilla Mail comes with built-in spam filtering. The
program uses advanced Bayesian filtering, as described in
Chapter 1. You don’t need to install any of the third-party pro-
grams listed in Chapter 11 — the features of those programs
are already built right in!
Junk Mail icon

Configuring your junk 
mail controls
By default, the Junk Mail Controls feature is turned on,
although you can turn it off or reconfigure it. Follow these
steps:
1. Click to select your e-mail account on the folder list
on the left side of the Netscape/Mozilla Mail window.
If you have only one e-mail account (you poor,
deprived soul!), it appears at the top of the list. If you
have several accounts, you can set the junk mail con-
trols separately for each account.
2. Choose Tools➪Junk Mail Controls from the
Netscape/Mozilla Mail menu bar.
If you see an informational message, click OK. You
see the Junk Mail Controls dialog box, as shown in
Figure 7-2. The drop-down menu at the top shows
which e-mail account you picked, if you have more
than one.
Figure 7-2: Netscape and Mozilla have built-in advanced Bayesian spam
filtering!
Chapter 7: Filtering Spam in Netscape and Mozilla Mail 107

3. If the Enable Junk Mail Controls check box isn’t
selected, click it.
This step turns the junk mail controls on. Leave
selected the check box that tells the program not to
mark messages as spam if they come from people in
your address book: Friends don’t let friends send spam.
4. Click the check box labeled Move Incoming Message
Determined To Be Junk Mail To so that it contains a
check mark.
Otherwise, the program marks messages with a little
Junk Mail icon, and they still clutter your inbox.
5. With the Junk Folder On option selected, set its
drop-down menu to Local Folders.
The program moves your suspected spam to the Junk
folder in the Local Folders section of the folder list.
6. Click the When I Manually Mark Messages As Junk
check box so that it contains a check mark, and then
select whether to move them to the Junk or Trash
folder.
If you have already determined that messages are
spam, we figure “Why save them?” You may as well
move them right to your Trash folder.
7. Click OK.
Training Netscape/Mozilla Mail 
to recognize spam
After you have configured your junk mail controls, Netscape/
Mozilla Mail is ready to trash your spam. You have only one
problem: It doesn’t know how to tell spam from good mail.
Your next step is to teach Netscape/Mozilla Mail to recognize
spam when it sees it. If the program thinks that a message is
spam, it either displays a little Junk Mail icon between the
subject and the sender’s name on the message list or moves
the message to your Junk folder, depending on how you con-
figured the program. Until you provide the program with some
guidance, however, it’s usually wrong.
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
108

To start training Netscape/Mozilla Mail to recognize spam,
follow these steps:
 If a message is marked as junk mail or is in your Junk
folder and it’s not spam, display the message and click
the Not Junk button.
 If a message is not marked as spam and it should be, click
the little diamond between the subject and the sender’s
name so that the diamond turns into a Junk Mail icon.
As Netscape/Mozilla Mail repeatedly sees which messages
you consider junk mail, it builds a list of words that usually
appear in spam but not in other messages, and its guesses get
better and better.
After marking spam and unmarking nonspam, you can delete
all your junk mail messages by choosing Tools➪Delete Mail
Marked As Junk In Folder.
Creating a Folder for Your Spam
(Or Other Messages)
Netscape/Mozilla Mail comes with a bunch of folders, such as
Inbox, Drafts, Templates, Junk, Sent, and Trash. The folders
stored on your own computer are listed under the Local
Folders heading on the folder list on the left side of the
Netscape/Mozilla Mail window (refer to Figure 7-1).
You don’t need to create a folder for spam because
Netscape/Mozilla Mail already comes with a Junk folder.
However, if you want to make your own folder for spam you
catch by using your own message filters (as described in the
next section), follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New➪Folder.
You see the New Folder dialog box, as shown in
Figure 7-3.
2. Type a name for the folder in the Name box.
For example, you can make a folder named Personal
for correspondence with your long-lost half-sister.
Chapter 7: Filtering Spam in Netscape and Mozilla Mail 109

Figure 7-3: Creating folders in Netscape or Mozilla Mail.
3. Click the dark drop-down list button and select Local
Folders, and then pick the option Choose This One
For The Parent from the menu that appears.
No, you’re not creating a folder for messages from
your parents. Folders can contain folders, and the pro-
gram wants to know in which folder (the parent folder)
to create your new folder. We think that this menu pick
could be rewritten, maybe to say Main Folder or some-
thing similar.
4. Click OK.
The folder appears in your Local Folders listing.
Creating Message Filters
to Trash Spam
The Netscape/Mozilla Mail message filters tell the program
what to do when it sees messages that match your specifica-
tion. For example, you can move all messages from
news@nytimes.com (the daily New York Times) to a News
folder. Message filters are created and stored separately for
each mail account you have, in case you retrieve messages
from more than one e-mail account.
To create a message filter, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Message Filters.
You see the Message Filters dialog box, as shown in
Figure 7-4.
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
110

Figure 7-4: Message filters tell Netscape/Mozilla Mail what to do when it
sees specific types of messages.
2. If you have more than one e-mail account, set the
Filters For drop-down list to the account you want to
filter.
3. Click the New button.
You see the enormous Filter Rules dialog box, as
shown in Figure 7-5.
Figure 7-5: What messages does this rule work with, and what does it do?
Chapter 7: Filtering Spam in Netscape and Mozilla Mail 111

4. In the Filter name box, type a name for the filter.
The exact name doesn’t matter: it’s only for your use.
The middle part of the window lists the criteria that
identify the messages you want to do something to.
You start with one criterion that says Subject and
Contains.
Figure 7-5 shows the window after you have created a
rule. Before you do so, the buttons are labeled Subject
and Contains.
5. Click Subject and choose the part of the message
that the program can use to identify messages.
For example, if you want to identify all messages from
your mother, set this option to Sender.
6. Click Contains and look at your other options.
Chances are that you want to leave this option set to
Contains.
Your other options include Doesn’t Contain, Is, Isn’t,
Begins With, Ends With, Is In My Address Book, and
Isn’t In My Address Book.
7. Click the box to the right of the last box and type the
text you’re looking for.
For example, type your mom’s address.
8. If you want to specify multiple criteria, click the
More button.
Another Sender/Contains line appears. Repeat
Steps 5–7 to create another criterion. You can keep
clicking More to get additional criterion lines.
For example, another way to identify messages from
your mom is that they end with “Love, Mom.”
9. If all the criteria must be true for the message to fit
your specs, choose Match All Of The Following.
Otherwise, leave Match Any Of The Following
selected.
This selection means that the filter finds messages
that match any one or more of the criteria.
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
112

10. Click Move To Folder on the Perform These Actions
list.
Or, choose one of the other options, which include
Delete The Message (probably not a good idea for
messages from your mother).
11. Click the drop-down button to the right of Move To
Folder and choose Local Folders and then the folder
to which you want to move the matching messages.
12. Click OK.
You go back to the Message Filters dialog box. You can
start over at Step 3 if you want to create more filters.
13. Click the X button in the upper-right corner of the
dialog box to close it.
The Netscape/Mozilla Mail built-in junk mail controls gener-
ally work better than creating your own filters, but you can
always do both. After enabling the junk mail controls, you can
create filters to move specific kinds of messages to your Junk,
Trash, or other folders.

Filtering Spam in Eudora
In This Chapter
 Setting up SpamWatch in Eudora
 Turning on spam filtering in Pegasus
 Creating mailboxes (folders) for your Eudora messages
 Filtering messages into mailboxes
E
udora has been around forever — we started using it in
the early 1990s. Luckily, the people at Qualcomm have
been updating it continually, and the latest version includes
not only message filters you can make yourself, but also what
they call SpamWatch — built-in Bayesian junk mail filters. Nice!
The reason that we like Eudora (well, one of the reasons) is
that it isn’t as susceptible to viruses as Outlook and Outlook
Express. Also, it doesn’t come bundled with a bunch of other
software you may not want, as Netscape and Mozilla Mail are.
If you use a Macintosh, consider Eudora because Mac ver-
sions are available.
If you want to try Eudora, you can download it from
www.eudora.com. You can run it in Sponsored mode, which
means that it’s free, but it displays ads. Or, you can run it for
free in Light mode, which omits some key features, including
SpamWatch. Or, you can pay about $49 a year for Paid mode,
in which you get all the features and no ads. Figure 8-1 shows
Eudora 6 in Paid mode.
For help in getting Eudora up and running, refer to The
Internet For Dummies, 9th Edition (Wiley Publishing, Inc.), by
two of the same three authors — the Levines, specifically —
who wrote this book.

Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
116
Figure 8-1: Eudora 6 includes SpamWatch, the Eudora junk mail filtering
feature.
Watching Out for Spam
with SpamWatch
The Eudora spam-filtering feature is named SpamWatch, and it
uses Bayesian filtering (a method of spotting spam based on
statistical analysis of the words in a message; see the sidebar
“Bayesian what?” in Chapter 1). Each incoming message gets a
junk score from 0 to 100. Higher scores mean that the message
is more likely to be spam because it contains spam-like format-
ting or words. You can choose how aggressive or conservative
SpamWatch should be by choosing the junk threshold — the
junk score above which Eudora considers a message to be
spam. Eudora starts with the threshold set at 50, and you can
move it higher or lower to catch more or less spam.
Configuring SpamWatch
When you install Eudora, it may ask whether you want to use
the Eudora Junk mailbox (folder), as shown in Figure 8-2. This
question is the Eudora way of asking whether you want to turn

SpamWatch on. Clicking Yes in response to this message tells
Eudora to create a mailbox (mail folder) named Junk and to
turn on SpamWatch filtering.
Figure 8-2: Do you want to turn on SpamWatch?
If you never saw this question, or if you answered No, all is
not lost. You can turn it on by changing a few configuration
settings. Even if you clicked Yes to turn SpamWatch on, you
may want to check or change the settings. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options from the Eudora menu.
You see the Options dialog box, with a long list of cate-
gories down the left side.
2. Scroll down to the Junk Mail category and select it.
You see the Junk Mail category of options, as shown in
Figure 8-3.
Figure 8-3: The Eudora Junk Mail (a.k.a. SpamWatch) settings.
Chapter 8: Filtering Spam in Eudora 117

3. Adjust the Junk Threshold setting as needed.
If you’re just starting out, leave it at 50. If SpamWatch
has been getting false positives (treating good mes-
sages as spam), move the slider to the left to a lower
number. If SpamWatch has been missing lots of spam,
move the slider to the right to a higher number.
We suggest that you leave the junk threshold alone for a
week or two after starting to use SpamWatch. The pro-
gram learns more about how to identify spam as you
tell it which good messages are junk and which junk
messages are spam, as described in the next section.
4. Click to select the Mail Isn’t Junk If Sender Is In An
Address Book check box, unless you expect to get
spam from friends.
For most people, messages from people in your
address book are never junk. However, your mileage
may vary!
5. Clear the Put Not Junk-ed Senders In Address Book
check box (click it until it’s empty).
This option creates a new entry for every nonspam
message you receive. We get lots of messages from
people we don’t expect to correspond with, so we
prefer to turn this setting off. However, if you receive
messages only from buddies, you may want to leave it
selected.
Note that Eudora ignores this setting if the option Mail
Isn’t Junk If Sender Is In An Address Book isn’t selected.
6. Select the Automatically Place Junk In Junk Mailbox
check box so that it contains a check mark.
The whole point of spam filtering, in our humble opin-
ions, is to get the spam out of our inboxes! If this
check box isn’t selected, Eudora marks suspected
spam with an icon and leaves it in your In folder. We
prefer to let Eudora move all suspected spam to the
Junk folder and then review the Junk folder every few
days, looking for false positives.
7. Leave the Junk Mailbox Is Never Marked Unread
check box unselected.
Selecting this check box means that even if new
messages have been shunted into the Junk mailbox,
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
118

Eudora doesn’t open the mailbox or display it in bold.
We prefer to know when Eudora has junked messages,
until we can get around to looking them over.
8. Leave the Remove Mail That Is At Least ___ Days Old
check box selected.
There’s no point keeping old spam. This setting tells
Eudora when to move messages from the Junk folder
to the Trash folder.
9. Leave the Warn Before Removing check box
selected.
If you clear this check box, Eudora doesn’t say any-
thing when it clears out old messages from your Junk
mailbox. Later, when you have SpamWatch trained so
that it reliably spots spam, you may want to turn this
option off.
A category named Junk Mail Extras contains some
truly arcane settings (they’re labeled Esoteric Stuff in
our version of Eudora), but we recommend leaving
them alone.
10. Click OK to close the Options dialog box.
Now, SpamWatch is up and running — it’s rating each message
as possible spam and moving to your Junk mailbox any mes-
sages with a rating of 50 or more.
Checking your Junk folder
SpamWatch examines each incoming message to determine
whether it’s naughty or nice. The naughty ones go into your
Junk folder (assuming that you choose the Automatically
Place Junk In Junk Mailbox option in the preceding section).
If the Junk mailbox isn’t already open, display it by choosing
Mailbox➪Junk. The Junk Score column (usually the second
column, right after the one with the big blue dots for unread
messages) shows you the number from 1 to 100 (refer to
Figure 8-1, earlier in this chapter).
At first, SpamWatch does a lousy of job of guessing which
messages are spam; your In mailbox may contain lots of junk,
and your Junk mailbox may contain lots of good messages.
SpamWatch doesn’t do as bad a job as many other filters right
Chapter 8: Filtering Spam in Eudora 119

out of the box, though; it appears to start with a dictionary of
words that traditionally appear in spam.
But you can train SpamWatch to do better. Training consists
of looking in your Junk mailbox and telling Eudora which mes-
sages aren’t spam and looking in your In mailbox (and any
other mailboxes that contain incoming mail) and telling
Eudora which messages are truly spam.
Look down the Subject lines of the messages in the Junk
folder. Because spammers use deceptive Subject lines, you
may need to select or open messages to tell whether they’re
spam. For messages that aren’t spam, select the message and
choose Message➪Not Junk (or press Ctrl+Shift+J). Leave the
rest of the spam in your Junk folder untouched; Eudora gets
rid of it after it has hung around for 30 days. If you would
rather not let the spam fester that long, you can select the
messages and click the Delete Messages button on the tool-
bar, choose Message➪Delete, or press Ctrl+D.
Marking spam that 
SpamWatch missed
The next step is to look at the messages in your In mailbox —
you’re probably about ready to look at them anyway because
those messages are the whole point of having e-mail. For each
message that is truly spam, select the message and either
choose Message➪Junk or press Ctrl+J. The message vanishes
to your Junk mailbox, and Eudora makes a note of the words
in the message, learning that messages with these words are
likely to be spam.
If you have filters that move incoming messages to other mail-
boxes (as described in the next two sections), check these
mailboxes too, for possible spam.
Are you curious about the junk scores of the messages in your
In mailbox? You can display the junk score of messages in all
your mailboxes, not just in the Junk mailbox. Choose Tools➪
Options, select the Mailboxes category, select the Junk check
box in the Show Mailbox Columns section of the dialog box,
and click OK. While you’re at it, you may want to clear the
check boxes for columns you would rather not see, like Priority,
Label, and Size.

Moving Messages into 
Eudora Mailboxes
Eudora SpamWatch works pretty well after it’s trained, but
you may want to create filters that spot specific types of mes-
sages and move them to your Junk mailbox (or other mail-
boxes). We use lots of filters, sorting our incoming mail into a
separate mailbox for each mailing list we’re on, along with a
mailbox for News (various daily newspapers and newsletters).
Note that what other e-mail programs call folders, Eudora calls
mailboxes. Same difference!
Creating Eudora mailboxes
Eudora comes with In, Out, Trash, and Junk folders (Junk is
new in Eudora 6). To make a new folder, choose Mailbox➪New
from the menu and type a mailbox name. Then click OK.
You can also organize your mailboxes into folders (like files in
directories). To create a folder in which to store mailboxes,
choose Mailbox➪New, type the folder name, click the Make It
A Folder check box, and click OK.
“What mailboxes do I have?” you may ask. To see a list of your
folders, choose Tools➪Mailboxes. A mailbox list appears on
the left side of the Eudora window. To close it, click the X in
the upper-right corner of the list.
Creating Eudora filters
to trash spam
To tell Eudora to sort your incoming messages into mailboxes,
you create filters (the concepts behind filtering are described
in Chapter 5). To see and create filters, choose Tools➪Filters.
You see the Filters dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-4. The
existing filters are listed down the left side of the dialog box,
and the details of the selected filter appear on the right side.
The details are in two sections: Match (which messages the
filter should catch) and Action (what to do with the messages).
Chapter 8: Filtering Spam in Eudora 121

Figure 8-4: Eudora filters can move messages to the Junk mailbox (or any
other mailbox) based on sender or addressee or words else-
where in the message.

Pegasus: An excellent, free e-mail
program with built-in spam filtering
If you like Eudora, you’ll probably like
Pegasus too. And Pegasus goes
Eudora one better: It’s completely free.
Pegasus has no Paid or Sponsored
modes. It’s just plain free, and you can
download it from www.pmail.com.
We don’t have space to describe how
to install Pegasus, but the instruc-
tions on the Pegasus Web site should
do the trick. If you decide to use
Pegasus, please consider making a
donation to its creator, or buying the
documentation, to keep the program
free.
David Harris, the creator of Pegasus,
claims to have invented mail filtering
in 1991. We disagree because one of
the authors of this book (John) was
filtering e-mail with his crusty old
Unix-based e-mail programs way
before 1991 — before PCs, in fact.
But Pegasus has had message filters
longer than any other Windows e-mail
program that we know of, and recent
versions ship with a set of filters that
can be used against spam.
To turn on spam filtering, choose
Tools➪Content Control, select the
Basic Spam Detection testing set (the
set of filters), click the Enable button,
and click Done. Pegasus now uses its
filters to move suspected spam to the
Junk Or Suspicious Mail folder.
The Pegasus Content Control feature
includes blacklists (lists of addresses
from which all messages should be
junked), whitelists (addresses from
which no messages should be
trashed), and rules (words consid-
ered in creating a weight, which is
equivalent to the Eudora junk score).

Making a new filter is easy:
1. Click the New button in the Filters dialog box to
create a new, blank filter.
All you have to do now is fill in all the blanks!
2. Click the Manual check box so that you can run the
filter on existing messages, not just on incoming
ones.
When the Manual option is selected, you can select a
bunch of messages in a mailbox and choose Special➪
Filter Messages to run your filters on those messages
at any time.
3. Set the Header drop-down box to the part of the
message in which you want Eudora to look.
Your options are To (addressee), From (sender),
Subject, Cc, Reply-to (not always the same as the From
line), Any Header, Body (the text of the message), Any
Recipient (any of the addresses that received this mes-
sage), Personality (the e-mail account you use to
create or receive the message), or Junk Score.
Some third-party spam-filtering software adds a spe-
cial header to spam messages: For example, POPFile
(described in Chapter 11) can add an X-Text-
Classification: spam header to messages it has
marked as spam. POPFile users can use the Any
Header option in your Eudora filter to move these
messages into your Junk folder.
4. In the blank box to the right of the Contains box,
type the text or address you want to match the text
or address you want to match.
For example, if you set the Header box to Subject, you
can type mortgage to match all messages that men-
tion mortgages on their Subject lines.
You can change the Contains setting if you want to
match all messages that don’t contain specific text or
other, more arcane situations.
5. To specify a second criterion for this filter, change
the Ignore box to And, Or, or Unless. Then select the
second Header box and type the text or address for
the second criterion to match.
Chapter 8: Filtering Spam in Eudora 123

For example, you may not want to trash messages that
mention mortgages if they’re from your bank. You can
set the Ignore box to Unless, set the second Header to
From, and type the bank’s address in the box to the
right of the second Contains box.
You’re done with the Match section of the filter. On to
the Action section! You can specify as many as five
actions, which is why you see five boxes labeled None.
You change the None setting to the action that you
want Eudora to take.
6. Click the first None box and set it to Junk.
If you’re filtering messages for a purpose other than
spam-trashing, you can choose any of the other
options. For example, if you’re creating a filter to move
messages from a mailing list to a separate mailbox,
you would choose Transfer To at this point. For some
choices, additional boxes, blanks, or check boxes
appear to the right of the None box, so you can spec-
ify more information about the action. For junking a
message, no other information is necessary.
7. Click the X box in the upper-right corner to close the
Filters dialog box, and click Yes to save your changes.
When you’re reading a message, you can use the Special➪
Make Filter command to create a new filter that moves all
messages from this sender to a new mailbox with the name of
the sender.

 Setting AOL to throw spam out, at least some of it
 Running AOL Communicator Mail
 Setting the AOL Communicator Mail junk mail settings
 Creating folders and filters in AOL Communicator Mail
 Configuring Netscape Mail to work with AOL
A
merica Online (AOL) has been a leader in fighting spam,
but AOL provides such an attractive target for spammers
that it has been a losing battle. Luckily, AOL users have several
options:
 Use the regular AOL software to read your e-mail. You
don’t have many filtering options, but you may as well as
configure those that are available. This chapter describes
AOL 9.0 spam and mail controls.
 Read your messages using AOL Communicator, a free
e-mail program that works with AOL. This chapter
describes how to get AOL Communicator and set it up,
including its spam filters.
 Use Netscape 7 to read your mail, with its built-in filtering
(described at the end of this chapter and in Chapter 7).
Our advice is to download and install AOL Communicator! It’s
a fine mail program, and not just for its spam filtering.

Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox

Fighting Spam in AOL 9
AOL filters out and throws away over a billion (that’s billion
with a b) spam messages every day. It has a full-time staff of
spam-fighters who write, test, and install new filters all the
time. However, lots of spam still gets through because even a
little bit of a billion messages is a great deal of spam.
Setting your AOL spam options
In the AOL 9.0 program, after you log in, choose Mail➪Block
Unwanted Mail to display the Mail and Spam Controls dialog
box, as shown in Figure 9-1.
Figure 9-1: You can configure the AOL mail and spam controls.
In this dialog box, select the screen name for which you want
to configure mail filters — you can use different filters for dif-
ferent screen names. Then select settings depending on what
you want to do:
 Receive mail only from people in your AOL address
book and on your Buddy List: Select the option Allow
Mail Only From People I Know.
 Specify addresses and domains to block: Select Use a
Custom Sender List and click the Custom Sender List link.
In the Custom Sender List dialog box, type addresses or
domain names and click Add after each one. Then click
Save.

 Avoid mail with graphics or attached files: Select the
Block Mail Containing Pictures Or Files check box.
 Use the AOL Spam Filter: You may as well use AOL spam
filtering, so leave the Mail Filtered By AOL Advanced
Spam Filter check box selected.
 Avoid mail that contains specific words: You can create
a list of words you don’t want to hear about. Select the
option Mail Containing Words On My Custom Word List
and click the Custom Word List link. In the Custom Word
List dialog box that opens, type your words and click
Add after each one. Then click Save.
After you have told AOL what mail to block, specify what to
do with blocked messages. Select the option Delivered To The
Spam Folder so that you can look through the messages from
time to time.
After you have set your mail-filtering options, click Save.
If you have screen names your children use, set their mail fil-
tering to Allow Mail Only From People I Know and add their
friends and relatives to their address books.
Creating folders for your mail
AOL can store messages in mail folders on your own com-
puter rather than on the AOL mail servers. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Read icon on the AOL toolbar.
The Mailbox window opens.
2. Select the Manage Mail tab.
3. On the My Mail Folders list on the left, scroll down
and select Saved On My PC.
You see a list of the AOL mail folders on your computer,
including Incoming/Saved Mail, Mail Waiting To Be Sent,
and Mail You’ve Sent.
4. Click the Setup Folders button and select Create
Folder.
You see a little Create New Folder dialog box.
5. Type a name for your folder and click Save.
Chapter 9: Filtering Spam in AOL and AOL Communicator 127

After you have created folders, you can store messages in them.
With a message selected, click the Save button and select On
My PC and then the name of the folder.
However, AOL doesn’t let you create filters that automatically
move messages to folders. For that task, you need to use a
better e-mail program, so keep reading!
Junking Spam in AOL
Communicator Mail
The free AOL Communicator program includes AOL
Communicator Mail, the AOL customized version of Netscape
Mail, as well as instant messaging and Radio@AOL — easy
access to streaming radio stations over the Internet. Its e-mail
program has many of the same commands and functions as
Netscape Mail, which is described in Chapter 7. The initial
version of AOL Communicator runs on Windows, and a Mac
version is coming.
One great thing about AOL Communicator Mail is that it
includes Bayesian spam filtering, just like Netscape 7.1 does.
(Because AOL owns Netscape, it’s probably the same filter.)
You can train AOL Communicator Mail to throw away lots of
spam that gets through the AOL server-based filters.
Getting AOL Communicator
If you want to download the program and try it, you can 
find it at www.aol.com/downloads or AOL keyword AOL
Communicator. Follow the instructions on the Web site to
download the program file (ac_install.exe) and then install it.
The program steps you through a configuration process.
After you install the program, you can start it by choosing
Start➪Programs➪AOL Communicator➪AOL Communicator or
double-clicking its icon on your desktop. Both the mail and
instant messaging windows pop up: Just close the IM window
if you don’t plan to use it.
AOL Communicator doesn’t connect you to AOL or to the
Internet. You need to use your usual method — the AOL
program or another connection program — to get online.
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
128

You can use AOL Communicator Mail for your AOL e-mail, as
well as for e-mail from most other accounts (except Hotmail
and MSN and other Web-based accounts). After AOL
Communicator is running, it looks like Figure 9-2.
Figure 9-2: AOL Communicator Mail is a big improvement over the AOL
built-in e-mail handling, including better spam blocking.
Don’t try to use other e-mail programs with AOL, because
they don’t work. Most normal e-mail programs work with POP
and IMAP mail servers (the standard types of Internet mail
server), and AOL runs its servers with its own proprietary
protocols. Only AOL Communicator and Netscape 7 work
directly with AOL.
Blocking spam in AOL
Communicator Mail
Isn’t it refreshing to see a Spam command right on your e-mail
program’s toolbar? No, it’s not for sending spam — it’s for
blocking it (but you probably already guessed that).
When you install AOL Communicator, its spam filters are
turned off for your AOL mail and turned on for any other (POP
or IMAP) e-mail accounts you set up. To turn on spam filtering
for your AOL messages, follow these steps:
Chapter 9: Filtering Spam in AOL and AOL Communicator 129

1. Choose Spam➪Spam Filter.
You see the Spam Filter dialog box, as shown in
Figure 9-3.
Figure 9-3: Turn on spam filtering for your AOL account.
2. If the Filter Spam For All Accounts option isn’t
selected, click it.
Your alternative is to select Only For The Selected
Accounts Below and then select from the list, but why
not filter everything?
3. Click to select the Options tab in the dialog box.
You see a few more options.
4. If the check box labeled Messages From People In
My Address Book Are Never Spam isn’t selected,
click it.
If you’re like us, you want to read all messages from
people you know, unless you hang around with lots of
spammers.
5. Select the Auto-Delete Spam 1 Week After I Receive
It check box.
If you collect antique spam, don’t select this option. If
you’re worried about deleting good messages that get
misidentified as spam, be sure to check your spam
folder, as described in the section “Showing, hiding, and
deleting spam,” later in this chapter. You may also want
to change 1 Week to 2 Weeks to give yourself more time
to sift through your spam for false positives.
6. Click OK.
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
130

The Reset Spam Filter button on the Options tab of the Spam
Filter dialog box wipes out all training you have already pro-
vided; that is, it empties the corpus of spam information that
the filters have been accumulating.
Training your spam filters
At first, the AOL Communicator Mail spam filters don’t spot
much spam because you need to train them to identify it. On
the list of incoming messages, an icon identifies each message
as okay (a sun) or spam (envelopes sticking out of a trash can,
like you see in the margin).
If (when) AOL Communicator Mail misses a piece of spam
(that is, a spam message doesn’t have a spam icon), correct it
by selecting, or opening, the message and clicking the Spam
button on the toolbar. The button has the same envelopes-in-
the-trash spam icon.
Conversely, AOL Communicator Mail may mark a good message
as spam. If so, select the message and choose Spam➪Mark As
Not Spam, right-click the message, and choose Mark As Not
Spam from the menu that appears, or (our favorite method)
click the This Is Not Spam button at the top of the message.
The more messages you tell the program about, the more
accurate its filtering becomes — that’s the genius of Bayesian
filtering.
Showing, hiding, and
deleting spam
You don’t have to look at the spam in your New Mail folder;
you can tell AOL Communicator Mail to hide it. Choose Spam➪
Show Spam Messages to toggle between showing and hiding
the messages that are marked as spam. We usually keep this
option unselected so that no check mark appears by the Show
Spam Messages command on the Spam menu and we don’t
have to deal with spam as we read our mail. But every few
days, follow these steps to check and get rid of your spam
messages:
Chapter 9: Filtering Spam in AOL and AOL Communicator 131

1. Select the New Mail folder on the Accounts And
Folders list (it’s probably already selected).
2. Choose Spam➪Show Spam Messages to display your
spam.
The messages are mixed in among your other
messages.
3. Scan down the messages that are marked as spam,
looking for any that aren’t spam. If you find any,
select the message and choose Spam➪Mark As Not
Spam.
Now all the spam-marked messages really are spam.
4. Choose Spam➪Delete Spam from This Folder to blow
the spam away.
Creating folders in AOL
Communicator Mail
Another way to avoid reading spam is to create folders for dif-
ferent sorts of messages and filters for moving suspected spam
into a specific folder. Chapter 5 describes the general idea.
To create a folder in AOL Communicator Mail, follow these
steps:
1. Choose File➪New➪Folder.
You see the New Folder dialog box.
2. Type a name for the folder in the Name box.
For example, you can make a folder named Suspected
Spam.
Leave the Create As A Subfolder Of option set to Local
Mail.
3. Click OK.
The folder appears in the Local Mail section of the
Accounts And Folders list.
Now you have a place to move messages that you think are
spam but that the AOL Communicator Mail spam filters are
missing. You can move messages from one folder to another
by hand, by either dragging them from the message list to
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
132

another folder on the Accounts and Folders list or by right-
clicking a message and choosing Move To and the folder name.
But AOL Communicator Mail can move messages automatically
if you create filters.
Creating filters in AOL
Communicator Mail
When you create a filter, you tell AOL Communicator Mail
what kinds of messages you want to work with and what to do
with them. To create a filter that identifies spam containing
specific words, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Custom Message Filters➪Setup.
You see the Setup Custom Message Filters dialog box.
2. Click the New Filter button.
The Custom Message Filter dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 9-4.
3. Type a name in the Filter name box (it can be any-
thing that reminds you what the filter is for).
4. On the Perform The Following Action line, set the
rightmost box to the name of the folder to which you
want to move the suspected spam.
You can move it right to the Trash folder, but a safer
method is to move it to a Suspected Spam folder that
you check and empty from time to time.
Figure 9-4: Filter your incoming messages into folders by subject, content,
or sender or by other information.
Chapter 9: Filtering Spam in AOL and AOL Communicator 133

The lower part of the dialog box contains the condi-
tion(s) that have to be met for AOL Communicator
Mail to apply the filter to a message. At first, one con-
dition appears, saying the subject of the mes-
sage contains ___.
5. Set the first drop-down box on the Condition line to
the part of the message you want the filter to look at.
You can select Subject, Sender, Date, Status, To, Cc, or
Recipient.
6. Set the second drop-down box on the condition line
to how the match should work.
Your options are Contains, Doesn’t contain, Is, Isn’t,
Begins with, or Ends with.
7. In the rightmost box on the condition line, type the
text to match.
Figure 9-4 shows a filter that matches any message
whose subject contains the word mortgage.
8. If you want multiple conditions for the filter, click
the Add + button to add another condition line, and
then repeat Steps 5–7 to create the new condition.
Also set the drop-down box in the line above the
first condition to either Any or All.
The line above the first condition line says If Any of
the following conditions are met, but you can
change Any to All.
9. Click OK to save the filter.
You can create lots of filters, including filters that sort mailing-
list and newsletter messages into separate folders.
Using Netscape to Read
Your AOL Mail
If you already use Netscape 7 Mail and you don’t feel like con-
verting over to AOL Communicator Mail, you can configure
Netscape Mail to work with your AOL messages. In Netscape
Mail, follow these steps:
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
134

1. Choose Edit➪Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings.
You see the Mail & Newsgroups Account Settings
dialog box.
2. Click the Add Account button.
The Account Wizard runs.
3. On the first Account Wizard screen, select AOL
account as the type of account. Click Next.
4. Type your name and your AOL screen name where
indicated and click Next.
Omit the spaces from your screen name when you
type it.
5. Click Finish and OK.
Now AOL Mail appears on the folder list on the left
side of the Netscape Mail window and contain one
folder — your AOL Inbox.
Refer to Chapter 7 to find out how to filter out spam using
Netscape 7.

 Reading your Yahoo! Mail messages with a real e-mail program
M
any Web-based mail systems exist — mailboxes you use
by going to a Web site, logging in, and reading and
sending messages by using your Web browser. Hotmail was the
first Web-based mail system we know of, but dozens are now
available, including Yahoo! Mail (owned by the popular Yahoo!
Web directory). The Microsoft MSN service uses Hotmail for
its mail, so everything we say about Hotmail applies to MSN
mail too. This chapter describes your spam-filtering options if
you use Hotmail, MSN, or Yahoo! Mail accounts.
You can follow two basic approaches:
 Turn on the spam filters that are built into Hotmail and
Yahoo! Mail. Both these services do their best to move
spam into a separate Junk Mail folder.
 Rather than read your messages via a Web browser,
download your Hotmail or Yahoo! Mail messages into
a real e-mail program, like Netscape Mail, Eudora, or
Outlook Express. Then use your e-mail program’s spam
filters.

Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
138
We recommend using both these approaches to minimize the
amount of spam you have to put up with.
Spam Options for Hotmail 
and MSN Users
Hotmail and MSN mail filter out tons of spam, although you
probably still get a fair amount. The next section explains how
to make sure that Hotmail or MSN is throwing away as much
spam as it can identify.
You have several options for reading your Hotmail or MSN
messages:
 Go to the www.hotmail.com or www.msn.com Web site
and use its Web-based system.
 Set up Outlook Express or Outlook to download your
Hotmail or MSN messages.
 Set up another e-mail program (like Netscape Mail or
Eudora) to read your Hotmail or MSN messages.
Later sections in this chapter describe how to reduce spam
by using Outlook Express, Outlook, or another e-mail program
rather than reading your mail on the Web.
Several third-party spam-filtering programs, including
InBoxCop (www.inboxcop.com), work with Hotmail or MSN
(see Chapter 11).
Setting your Hotmail or
MSN spam options
Hotmail and MSN can spot some spam and move it out of your
Inbox folder and into a separate Junk Mail folder.
After you log in at www.hotmail.com or www.msn.com, select
the Options tab. (It may not look like a tab, but it appears on a
row with a bunch of tabs, so we assume that it’s a tab.) Hotmail
and MSN list several spam-related options you can click to
configure, as shown in Figure 10-1:

Figure 10-1: Hotmail and MSN have built-in junk mail filters.
 Junk Mail Filter: Selects the Junk Mail Filter level. Your
choices are Default, Enhanced (catches more spam, but
may mislabel more good mail as spam), and Exclusive
(filters out all messages except those from people on
your Contacts list, Hotmail administration itself, and MSN
announcements you have signed up for). If you get lots of
spam, try setting your filters to Enhanced.
 Safe List: Creates a list of addresses or domains from
which messages are never filtered as spam. If you work 
at an organization with a domain name (for example, 
you work at Joe’s Bank with the domain name joesbank.
com), you may want to put your organization’s domain on
the Safe List so that no messages from coworkers are
ever considered to be spam.
 Mailing Lists: Creates a list of addresses that appear on
the To line of messages that aren’t spam. Most messages
you receive have your address on the To line, but not all
of them. Many e-mail mailing lists send messages with
the list address (rather than your address) in the To
header.
 Block Sender: Creates a list of addresses or domains for
which all messages are marked as spam.
 Custom Filters: Creates filters that move messages that
match your criteria to a folder or into the trash, as
shown in Figure 10-2. Click the Create New button to
make a filter. (Refer to Chapter 5 for the concepts behind
creating mail filters.)
Chapter 10: Filtering Spam in Hotmail, MSN, and Yahoo! Mail 139

Figure 10-2: You can create your own filters in Hotmail and MSN.
Hotmail and MSN come with Inbox and Junk Mail folders, but
you can create additional folders in which to store your mail.
To make a new folder, select the Home tab, click the View All
Folders link, and click the Create New button. To move a mes-
sage to a folder, select or display a message, click the Put In
Folder pull-down button, and select the folder name from the
menu that appears. Or, select one or more messages from
your Inbox by selecting their check boxes and then click the
Put In Folder button.
Reading Hotmail or MSN mail
from Outlook Express or Outlook
Hotmail and MSN use a proprietary mailbox protocol rather
than the industry standard POP and IMAP, so most e-mail pro-
grams can’t read or send mail directly via Hotmail or MSN.
(See the next section for workarounds, though.) Outlook,
Outlook Express, Hotmail, and MSN all come from Microsoft,
so it’s not too surprising that they work together.
Follow these steps to configure Outlook 2002, Outlook 2003, or
Outlook Express to read and send messages via your Hotmail
or MSN account (Outlook 2000 doesn’t work with Hotmail):
1. In Outlook Express, choose Tools➪Accounts, click
the Add button, and choose Mail from the menu that
appears. In Outlook, choose Tools➪E-Mail Accounts
and choose Add A New E-Mail Account.
A wizard runs. Answer the wizard’s questions and
click Next to move from screen to screen.
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
140

2. When the wizard asks about server types, change
POP3 to HTTP as the type of server (in Outlook
Express) or click HTTP (in Outlook).
HTTP (or HyperText Transfer Protocol, to be precise)
is the protocol that Web browsers use to talk to Web
servers.
3. Set the My HTTP Mail Server Provider Is or HTTP
Mail Service Provider box to Hotmail.
4. Answer the rest of the questions, clicking Next as
needed, and then click Finish.
If you use Outlook, you’re done.
5. In Outlook Express, click Close to dismiss the
Internet Accounts dialog box.
Outlook Express asks whether you want to download
folders from the mail server you just added (Hotmail).
6. Click Yes.
Now Hotmail and its various folders appear on your Folders
list. Refer to Chapter 6 to find how to set up spam filtering in
Outlook and Outlook Express.
Reading Hotmail or MSN mail
with any old e-mail program
In theory, you can’t use other e-mail programs (like Netscape
Mail or Eudora) to read Hotmail messages because Hotmail
doesn’t use any Internet standard protocol. Instead, it uses
a proprietary Microsoft protocol (Microsoft avoids following
standards because, as far as we can tell, it would rather force
you to use its products than to let you have a choice of
programs.)
However, the free program Hotmail Popper (from
www.boolean.ca/hotpop) makes Hotmail look like a stan-
dard POP (Post Office Protocol) server, from which most
e-mail programs can retrieve messages. For example, you can
use Hotmail Popper and Eudora 6, an e-mail program with
good spam filtering, to read and send Hotmail messages.
Chapter 10: Filtering Spam in Hotmail, MSN, and Yahoo! Mail 141

Spam Options for Yahoo!
Mail Users
Yahoo! Mail is our favorite Web-based mail system. You use it
by pointing your Web browser at mail.yahoo.com and sign-
ing up for a free account. Like Hotmail and MSN, Yahoo! Mail
includes spam filtering. You can also use other e-mail programs
to read and send messages via Yahoo! Mail.
When you read the messages in your Yahoo! Mail inbox, if you
see a spam message, click the Spam button rather than the
Delete button. The Spam button educates Yahoo! Mail about
what your spam looks like so that it can do a better job of
spotting it and directing it into your Bulk (junk mail) folder.
Setting your Yahoo!
Mail filtering options
The Yahoo! Mail spam-filtering system is SpamGuard, and you
don’t need to turn it on or configure it. SpamGuard moves
messages that look like spam into your Bulk folder. After 30
days, these messages are deleted. You should check your Bulk
folder every week or so to look for false positives — good mes-
sages that have gotten lumped in with the spam. If you find
one, click its Not Spam button.
To configure the Yahoo! Mail filters, sign in and click the Mail
Options link. Then click one of these four links:
 Spam Protection: You can turn SpamGuard on or off and
your SpamGuard options.
 Anti-Spam Resource Center: This link takes you to the
Yahoo! Mail pages about spam and how to avoid it.
 Block Addresses: You can specify addresses or domains
from which you don’t want to receive mail. Yahoo! Mail
moves those messages right into the trash.
 Filters: You can create filters that move messages match-
ing your criteria out of your Inbox folder and into another
folder (which can be the Trash folder). Click Add to create
a new filter (you can have as many as 15). Fill out the form
shown in Figure 10-3 and click the Add Filter button.
Part II: Filtering Spam Out of Your Inbox 
142

Figure 10-3: Yahoo! Mail lets you create filters to move messages from
your inbox to another folder (or right into the trash).
To create folders in Yahoo! Mail, click the Add link to the right
of the Folders link on the main Yahoo! Mail page.
Reading Yahoo! Mail with
another e-mail program
Yahoo! offers POP access for $20 per year. You can download
Yahoo! Mail messages into an e-mail program like Netscape
Mail, Eudora, or Outlook Express. We like this idea because
you can then use the additional spam filters in these pro-
grams. However, we’re not crazy about paying $20 a year
(although now that we think of it, that’s not much money for
the convenience of less spam).
An alternative is to use a free program named YahooPOPs to
provide POP access to Yahoo! Mail. You can download it from
yahoopops.sourceforge.net.

Spam-Filtering
Programs and

In this part . . .
F
ew e-mail programs include truly effective spam ﬁl-
ters. This part of the book describes some additional
ways you can get the spam out of your inbox, including
installing extra spam-ﬁltering software and signing up for
spam-ﬁltering services. We have been amazed at how
effective spam-ﬁltering software has become — some
great spam ﬁlters are even available for free!
And we have something for the geeks among you, too. For
people who run mail servers (the Internet server comput-
ers that store mailboxes), Chapter 13 talks about server-
based spam-ﬁghting systems.

 Why you should install a spam filter?
 Lots of spam-filtering programs to consider
 POPFile: the people’s spam filter
 Spam Bully, a program that plugs into Outlook and Outlook Express
A
gaggle of spam-fighting programs are on the market.
We have been amazed to see how many send out spam
to suggest that you buy them: Isn’t that a bit like your doctor
infecting you with influenza so that he can provide the antibi-
otic to cure it?
However, some antispam programs are worth their weight in
gold. This chapter reviews a few spam-filtering programs that
run under Windows and trap spam even before your e-mail
program receives it.
Chapter 12 describes ISPs and other services you can sub-
scribe to if you don’t want to install antispam software on
your computer. Chapter 13 is for the geeks who run mail
servers, corporate networks, and ISPs and need large-scale,
hard-core, server-based spam-filtering solutions.
Keep in mind that filtering your e-mail doesn’t make the prob-
lem of spam go away. Your ISP still receives, processes, and
delivers thousands, millions, or even billions of unwanted
e-mails. Just because you may get good results in filtering

Part III: Spam-Filtering Programs and Services 
148
doesn’t mean that the costs of all those extra servers and
Internet connections aren’t being passed along to you. Just
remember that although filters may help you win your daily
spam battles, the war against spammers is bigger and more
costly than you can imagine.
Most E-Mail Programs 
Can’t Go It Alone
Part II describes the spam-filtering features of the major e-mail
programs, and frankly, only two of the programs do much to rid
your inbox of spam. If your e-mail program doesn’t have spam-
filtering features built in, consider switching to one that does
or installing a third-party program that specializes in snagging
spam.
The exceptions to this statement are Netscape, Mozilla, and
Eudora, which have advanced filtering built in. Netscape Mail
(starting with Version 7.1) and Mozilla Mail (starting with
Version 1.3), which we describe in Chapter 7, already include
the type of spam-spotting that stand-alone spam filters like
POPFile provide. Eudora 6 does too (refer to Chapter 8).
How third-party programs work
Many of these programs act as proxy servers —programs that
stand between you and the Internet (in this case, between
your e-mail program and your ISP’s mail server). Instead of
your e-mail program getting the mail from the mail server
directly, the spam filter program gets your messages from the
mail server and throws out most of the spam, and then your
e-mail program gets your messages from your spam filter pro-
gram. Yes, it’s an extra step, but lots of spam can disappear
along the way.
Table 11-1 lists some popular and effective spam-filtering pro-
grams you can install on Windows, UNIX, or Linux systems or
on the Mac. Table 11-2 lists programs that work with only
Outlook or Outlook Express.

Because new versions of these programs come out all the time
(they have to, in order to stay ahead of the spammers), we
don’t include step-by-step instructions for all these programs.
Instead, we describe one stand-alone program (POPFile) and
one Outlook Express add-in (Spam Bully) in detail, so you get
the idea. Other programs work similarly.

What if you don’t POP?
Many stand-alone spam filters work with only POP (also know
as POP3, both of which are acronyms for Post Office Protocol)
mail accounts. Luckily, this type of account is the type that 99
percent of ISPs provide. Here are other types of mail accounts,
and what to do if you use them:
 Hotmail and MSN: Hotmail and MSN have a proprietary
Web-based protocol. Luckily, you can configure Outlook
Express and Outlook to work with them. Then install
one of the spam filters listed in Table 11-2. InBoxCop
(www.inboxcop.com) also works with Hotmail and MSN.
Alternatively, you can install a free program named
Hotmail Popper (from www.boolean.ca/hotpop), which
provides POP access to Hotmail. InBoxCop, Lyris
MailShield Desktop, MailWasher Pro, and Spam Sleuth
(described in Table 11-1) all work with Hotmail and MSN.
Chapter 11: A Round-Up of Desktop Antispam Programs 153
The latest on antispam programs
Spam programs are popping up like mushrooms after a spring rain, and by the
time you read this chapter, another 50 may be available. A number of Web
sites are devoted to listing and reviewing spam filters, including these:
 Spamotomy (www.spamotomy.com): Spam news and a listing of
programs
 About.com’s Internet For Beginners Spam page (www.netfor
beginners.about.com/cs/spam): Tips and tricks
 About.com’s Email Anti-Spam Tools and Services page (email.about.
com/cs/antispamreviews)
 WebAttack.com’s Anti-Spam Tools page: Shareware (www.webattack.
com/shareware/comm/swspam.html)
 WebAttack Internet Tools’ Anti-Spam Tools: Freeware (www.
webattack.com/freeware/comm/fwspam.html): Ditto, for free-
ware (programs that are totally free)
Also check our Web site at privacy.gurus.com for news about spam.

 Yahoo! Mail: Yahoo! Mail is another Web-based mail
system. Yahoo! provides POP access to your Yahoo! Mail
account for $20 a year. To turn this option on, click Mail
Options on the Yahoo! Mail Web page and then click the
POP Access and Mail Forwarding link. Alternatively, you
can try a free utility named YahooPOPs (at yahoopops.
sourceforge.net). It claims to provide POP access to
Yahoo! mailboxes, but may result in a confusing setup.
InBoxCop and Spam Sleuth (described in Table 11-1) also
work with Yahoo! Mail.
 AOL: You can use AOL Communicator Mail to read your
AOL mail, and it includes Baysian filtering. InBoxCop and
Spam Sleuth (described in Table 11-1) also work with AOL.
 Lotus Notes: Some large organizations use Lotus Notes
for e-mail, calendars, and shared conferencing. POPFile
works with Lotus Notes.
 IMAP and Microsoft Exchange: These types of mailboxes
are used in many large organizations. The mailboxes allow
you to read and send e-mail while leaving your messages
on the central server, rather than download messages to
your computer. Talk to your system administrator and
tell her to read Chapter 13 of this book to provide server-
level spam blocking. Some of the spam-blockers in Tables
11-1 and 11-2 work with IMAP accounts.
POPFile: The Open Source
Spam Filter
POPFile is one of a number of powerful but simple programs
that can greatly reduce the amount of spam that ends up in
your inbox. POPFile is a Bayesian filter, a filter you train to tell
the difference between spam and not spam based on experi-
ence. (See the “Bayesian what?” sidebar in Chapter 1.) This
section of the chapter describes POPFile in some detail,
although other Bayesian filtering programs work similarly.
POPFile provides a powerful tool for separating spam from
good messages. Here’s how it works:
1. POPFile retrieves your mail from your POP mail server,
by pretending to be your e-mail program.
Part III: Spam-Filtering Programs and Services 
154

2. POPFile examines each message and tags those that
appear to be spam with a special mail header or spe-
cial words added to the Subject line.
3. Your regular e-mail program gets your mail from
POPFile.
4. Using a rule that you create in your e-mail program,
your program filters all the messages that POPFile
tagged into a Suspected Spam folder or directly into
the trash. (Part II describes how to create rules to
filter incoming messages into a folder).
Although some e-mail programs (such as Outlook 2003) have
elaborate spam-filtering rules, those rules aren’t as sophisti-
cated as POPFile’s. By running as a stand-alone program,
POPFile can work with almost any e-mail program. POPFile
doesn’t throw away spam; it tags it so that your e-mail pro-
gram can throw it away.
If you use Netscape Mail 7.1 (or later), Mozilla Mail 1.5 (or
later), or Eudora 6, you already have a Bayesian filtering pro-
gram like POPFile built right in. Refer to Chapter 7 to find out
how to turn on the Netscape and Mozilla junk mail controls.
Chapter 8 describes the Eudora 6 spam filter. Just turn on
these programs’ junk mail controls and forget about POPFile.
How POPFile tags messages
When POPFile tags your messages, it marks them as belonging
in a specific bucket, the POPFile equivalent of a folder. You
should create at least two buckets: one for spam and one for
everything else. Then you have two choices for how POPFile
tags the messages for each bucket:
 Adding a new header: Every e-mail message contains
lots of header lines showing its path from the sender to
the receiver, although your e-mail program does you the
favor of not displaying all of them. POPFile can add an
extra header, named X-Text-Classification, that contains
the name of the bucket the message is in. For example, if
you tell POPFile to tag your messages by adding a header,
it adds this line to the header of each message tagged for
your Spam bucket:
X-Text-Classification: spam
Chapter 11: A Round-Up of Desktop Antispam Programs 155

 Subject modification: Alternatively, POPFile can add the
bucket name to the beginning of the Subject heading for
each message, like this:
Subject: [spam] Eliminate Your Debt Now!
Which tagging system you use depends on which e-mail pro-
gram you use. (See the chapter in Part II that describes your
e-mail program.) Almost all e-mail programs can filter mes-
sages based on the Subject line text (for example, moving all
messages with [spam] on the Subject line directly into your
Deleted Items or Trash folder).
You can make as many buckets in POPFile as you like: It’s not
limited to looking for spam. You can use POPFile to separate
your mail into personal and business mail or to separate mes-
sages that come from mailing lists or newsletters.
Part III: Spam-Filtering Programs and Services 
156
How POPFile classifies your messages
POPFile sorts your incoming mes-
sages into buckets (like folders) using
several types of information to tag
your e-mail messages. Unfortunately,
POPFile uses its own, strange terms
for this information:
Corpus: The collection of words that
POPFile associates with a bucket. For
example, the Spam bucket’s corpus
may include words like debt and
mortgage and the names of various
body parts not normally discussed in
polite society. Surprisingly, POPFile
looks only for individual words, not
for phrases: the matching of phrases
slows the process too much.
Pseudowords: Nontext indicators
telling POPFile that a message is
likely to be spam. Spammers use var-
ious tricks to avoid getting detected
as spam, such as bogus HTML codes
and HTML comments within words,
words with spaces between each
pair of letters, and messages that
consist entirely of graphical images.
POPFile looks for these tricks and
figures that only spam would contain
them!
Magnet: A word that, when it
appears in a message header, tells
POPFile to put the message in a spe-
cific bucket regardless of the other
words in the message: It’s a kind of
override. For example, you may want
your boss’s e-mail address to be a
magnet for your Inbox bucket, to pre-
vent any message from your boss
from getting mixed in with the spam.
Armed with this information, POPFile
uses Bayesian filtering to figure out
which message goes in each of your
buckets. (Refer to Chapter 1 to find out
what the heck Bayesian filtering is.)

If you’re using POPFile only to reduce the amount of spam you
have to see, you need just two buckets: Spam and Inbox.
Installing POPFile
POPFile is an open source program, which means that you can
download it and run it for free. The program’s home page is at
popfile.sourceforge.net — click English (or the language
of your choice) to see instructions for downloading and
installing the program.
POPFile comes in two versions:
 Windows version: This version is a ready-to-run version
for Windows.
 Perl version: You may never have heard of Perl, but it’s
a widely used programming language, and Perl programs
can run on the Mac and on Unix and Linux machines.
Just make sure that you have Perl on your machine.
See the POPFile manual (online at the POPFile site) for
information.
Windows users can follow these steps:
1. Download the Windows-ready version by starting at
popfile.sourceforge.net/manual/installing.
html and clicking the POPFile Download Page link.
Select the latest version to download and store it on
your hard disk.
You get a zip file (which Windows XP calls a compressed
folder) with a name like popfile-v0.18.2-windows.zip.
2. Open the zip file in Windows Explorer, by choosing
My Computer, navigating to where you stored the
file, and double-clicking the filename.
You see one file, setup.exe.
3. Double-click the file to run the setup program.
A wizard runs and steps you through the installation.
Click Next and Install to move from screen to screen.
Among other things, the wizard offers you the option of
skins (different color schemes for the POPFile windows)
and languages (if you want to see the POPFile windows
and prompts in a language other than English). Leave
Chapter 11: A Round-Up of Desktop Antispam Programs 157

the POP3 port number set to 110 and the default port
number for interface connections set to 8080, as the
wizard suggests.
4. Select the Run POPFile Automatically When
Windows Starts check box so that POPFile is always
ready to process your mail.
5. If the wizard finds Outlook Express on your machine
(and because it comes with Windows, it does), it
offers to set Outlook Express to get its mail via
POPFile. Select the Reconfigure This Account To
Work With POPFile check box if you use Outlook
Express.
If you use another e-mail program, you need to
configure it yourself, as described in the section
“Configuring your e-mail program to work with
POPFile ,” later in this chapter. Don’t worry about it
now — just keep reading and following our instruc-
tions until you get to that section.
6. Click Finish to close the wizard.
7. Start POPFile by choosing Start➪Programs➪
POPFile➪Run POPFile in the background.
Nothing appears to happen. But POPFile should be
ready to scam for spam!
To ensure that POPFile is alive, Windows 2000 and Windows XP
users can press Ctrl+Alt+Del to see the Windows Task Manager
window and select the Processes tab. POPFile appears as
Wperl.exe.
Setting POPFile to run
on Windows Startup
Every time you start your computer and Windows, you need
for POPFile to start too. Follow these steps to tell Windows to
run POPFile in the background (that is, without a window)
every time Windows starts (these instructions are for
Windows XP):
Part III: Spam-Filtering Programs and Services 
158

1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪POPFile.
You see a menu of installed POPFile programs.
2. Find the Startup folder on the All Programs menu.
The programs in this folder run when Windows 
starts up.
3. Click and drag the Run POPFile In Background
option to the Startup folder. Don’t release the mouse
button yet.
A menu opens, showing the programs that now run on
startup. (The menu may contain programs you didn’t
know about!)
4. Move the mouse to that menu and release the mouse
button to drop the POPFile entry into the Startup
group.
Now POPFile runs whenever Windows runs.
Talking to POPFile
POPFile doesn’t have its own window. Instead, to talk to
POPFile, you use your Web browser. Run your browser and
type this interesting-looking address:
127.0.0.1:8080
Yes, those are all numbers: 127.0.0.1 tells your browser to
look on your own computer, and 8080 is the Internet port
number on which POPFile communicates. Strange but true!
You see a Web page that looks like Figure 11-1: your POPFile
Control Center. (This figure shows the page in the Netscape 7.1
browser, but the page itself looks about the same regardless
of which browser you use.) If you have a version of POPFile
later than 0.18.2, your Web page may look a little different.
In the POPFile Control Center, you create buckets to sort mail,
correct POPFile when it sorts messages into the wrong
bucket, and perform other configuration tasks.
Chapter 11: A Round-Up of Desktop Antispam Programs 159

Figure 11-1: POPFile is ready to scan for spam.
Creating buckets in POPFile
After POPFile is up and running, you need to create a bucket
for spam. Creating a bucket tells POPFile that you want mes-
sages tagged with [spam] on the Subject line (or a special 
X-Text-Classification header that includes the word spam) so
that your e-mail program can filter these messages into the
trash.
Part III: Spam-Filtering Programs and Services 
160
POPFile doesn’t have to mess
with your Subject lines
Normally, POPFile adds a bucket
name to the beginning of the Subject
line and adds an X-Text-Classification
header line to each message. If your
e-mail program can sort your incom-
ing messages based on their header
lines, you don’t need for POPFile to
mess with your Subject lines. To turn
off Subject-line-messing, click the
Configuration link in the POPFile
Control Center, look in the E-Mail Text
Insertion section of the page, and
click the Turn Off button next to the
label Subject Line Modification. This
command turns off Subject line mod-
ification for all buckets.
Outlook and Eudora can filter all
messages based on the X-Text-
Classification (or any other) header.
For details, see Part II.

To create a bucket for spam, follow these steps:
1. Run your browser and go to this address:
127.0.0.1:8080
You see the POPFile Control Center (refer to
Figure 11-1).
2. Click the Buckets link.
You see a summary of your buckets (as shown in
Figure 11-2), with arcane statistics about them.
Because you don’t have any buckets yet, you don’t 
see much.
3. Scroll down to the Maintenance section, type spam
in the Create Bucket With Name box, and click
Create.
You have a bucket!
Figure 11-2: Make one bucket for spam and one for everything else.
We like to create two buckets: Spam and Inbox. We turn off
Subject line modification for the Inbox bucket so that POPFile
doesn’t add [inbox] to the beginning of the Subject line of all
our nonspam messages. To turn this feature off, go to the
Buckets page in the POPFile Control Center and click the Turn
Off button in the Subject Modification column, to the right of
the Inbox bucket. You end up with a POPFile configuration
that looks like Figure 11-2.
Now you can spot messages that POPFile thinks are spam
because they have [spam] at the beginning of the Subject line.
Chapter 11: A Round-Up of Desktop Antispam Programs 161

Configuring your e-mail program
to work with POPFile
If POPFile sees a copy of Outlook Express on your computer, it
does part of the configuration for you. Otherwise, you need to
make a note of how your program now gets the mail, tell the
program to get messages from POPFile instead, and tell
POPFile to use your e-mail program’s settings to get your mail.
The settings you need to note are shown in this list:
 Incoming mail server: The POP (or POP3) mail server
that stores your incoming messages until you pick them
up, usually provided by your ISP. You need to change this
setting in your e-mail program from its current setting to
127.0.0.1, the address of POPFile running on your own
computer.
 User name: The name your e-mail program uses to con-
nect to your incoming mail server, almost always the same
as the part of your e-mail address before the @. For exam-
ple, if your address is billgates@microsoft.com, your
user name is billgates. You need to change this name
to a combination of your original incoming mail server
name, a colon, and your user name. For example, if your
incoming mail server is pop.earthlink.net, you may
change this setting to pop.earthlink.net:billgates.
 Password: The password that your e-mail program uses
to connect to your incoming mail server. Don’t change
this setting.
If you’re not sure what your incoming mail server, user name,
or password are, ask your ISP (assuming that you use the
address your ISP provides with your account).
Even if you do use Outlook Express, you still need to tell it
to direct any messages that POPFile has tagged as spam into
your Suspected Spam or Deleted Items folder. Most e-mail pro-
grams let you create rules or filters for this purpose. (Part II
contains detailed instructions for each major e-mail program.)
The following sections contain step-by-step instructions to
configure your e-mail program to fetch your mail via POPFile
rather than directly from your mail server, and to sort spam
out of your inbox.
Part III: Spam-Filtering Programs and Services 
162

If you use Netscape 7.1, Mozilla 1.3, or Eudora 6, you already
have spam-spotting features equivalent to POPFile’s built in.
Just turn them on! Refer to Chapters 7 and 8.
POPFile sometimes conflicts with virus checkers, firewalls,
and other security software. If you run into trouble getting
POPFile to work, read the online manual at
popfile.sourceforge.net/manual/manual.html

popfile.sourceforge.net , clink the link for your language,
and click the FAQ link. (It’s toward the bottom of the page, last
time we looked.)
Configuring Outlook Express
or Outlook for POPFile
The POPFile installation program tries to set up Outlook
Express for you, but you may want to double-check its set-
tings. In Outlook Express or Outlook, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Accounts.
You see the Internet Accounts dialog box.
2. Click the Mail tab.
3. Select your mail account if it’s not already selected,
and click the Properties button.
You see the Properties dialog box for your e-mail
account.
4. Click the Servers tab.
You see the dialog box shown in Figure 11-3.
5. Change the Account Name setting from its current
setting to your incoming mail server name, a colon,
and your user name.
You can copy the server name from the Incoming Mail
(POP3) setting.
6. Change the Incoming Mail (POP3) setting from its
current setting to 127.0.0.1.
7. Leave the rest of the settings alone, and click OK and
then Close to save your changes.
Chapter 11: A Round-Up of Desktop Antispam Programs 163

Figure 11-3: Changing your Outlook or Outlook Express configuration to use
POPFile.
Outlook or Outlook Express now gets your mail via POPFile.
Your other task is to create a rule that sorts your spam-tagged
messages into the Deleted Items folder. See the section in
Chapter 6 about creating rules to trash spam to find out how
rules and filters can sort any messages with [spam] in them
into the Deleted Items folder.
Outlook (but not Outlook Express) can sort messages based
on the POPFile X-Text-Classification header, so you can avoid
having the bucket name appear at the beginning of each mes-
sage’s Subject line. Follow the steps in the sidebar “POPFile
doesn’t have to mess with your Subject lines,” earlier in this
chapter. Then create a rule in Outlook that looks for messages
that have this text in the header:
X-Text-Classification: spam
If you use Outlook, see the section in Chapter 6 about trap-
ping spam based on the X-Text-Classification or other spam-
tagging header.
Configuring Pegasus for POPFile
Pegasus (described in the Chapter 8 sidebar “Pegasus: An
excellent, free e-mail program with built-in spam filtering”)
works with POPFile too. Follow these steps to configure
Pegasus:
Part III: Spam-Filtering Programs and Services 
164

1. Choose Files➪Network Configuration or Tools➪
Internet Options.
You see the Internet Mail Options dialog box.
2. Click the Receiving (POP3) tab.
3. If a list of hosts appears, select your e-mail account
and click Edit.
4. Change the User Name setting from its current set-
ting to your incoming mail server name, a colon,
and your user name.
You can copy the server name from the POP3 or
Server Host Name setting.
5. Change the POP3 host or Server host name from its
current setting to 127.0.0.1.
6. Leave the rest of the settings alone and click OK to
save your changes.
Training POPFile
After POPFile is running and scanning all your incoming
messages, you find that absolutely nothing happens! That’s
because it has no idea how to classify messages into buckets.
You need tell it, by training it.
Giving POPFile the general idea
To train POPFile when you first start using it (it makes zillions
of mistakes at first), follow these steps:
1. In your e-mail program, give the command, click the
button, press the keys, or otherwise cause the pro-
gram to get your e-mail.
Your messages pass through POPFile on their way into
your e-mail program. Later, you can read messages in
the e-mail program and just use the POPFile Control
Center to correct the occasional mistake. However, at
the beginning, POPFile makes so many mistakes that
it’s easier to look at all your messages in the POPFile
Control Center first.
2. In another window, run your browser, bring up the
POPFile page at 127.0.0.1:8080, and click the
History link.
Chapter 11: A Round-Up of Desktop Antispam Programs 165

You see a Web page that looks like the one shown in
Figure 11-4.
3. Look down the list of messages for messages that are
misclassified or unclassified.
For each message, the history listing shows you the
sender, the subject, the POPFile guess for the bucket,
a drop-down box you can set to the correct bucket for
the message, and a check box that lets you remove the
message from the history list. At first, all messages are
unclassified.
4. For messages that aren’t assigned to the right bucket
(or that are unclassified), select the box in the
Should Be column for the message and set it to the
correct bucket. If you can’t guess from the sender
and the Subject line, click the Subject line to see the
whole message.
5. Repeat Step 4 for all messages on the page.
6. When you get to the bottom of the page, click the
Reclassify button to tell POPFile to update its bucket
information.
POPFile redisplays the page, showing you where each
message is now.
Figure 11-4: POPFile makes lots of mistakes until you train it to spot
spam; click History to see how POPFile tagged your recent
messages.
Part III: Spam-Filtering Programs and Services 
166

7. To get rid of messages you have already fixed, click
the Remove Page button.
POPFile displays the next page of messages, if you
have more messages than fit on one page (POPFile
usually displays 20 messages per page). Carry on,
starting over at Step 3.
If your e-mail program displays message headers, you can see
the X-POPFile-Link header at the top of the message in your
e-mail program, with a long, hairy-looking link, like this:
X-POPFile-Link:
<http://127.0.0.1:8080/jump_to_message?
view=popfile86=15.msg>
Click the link to jump directly to the POPFile Control Center
page about that particular message. (The page appears in
your browser window.)
Fixing the occasional POPFile mistake
After you have trained POPFile for a few days, the number of
mistakes usually drops to just a few. Rather than look at the
POPFile Control Center’s History page first, you can switch to
reading your e-mail as usual. Look through the messages in
your Junk E-Mail or Suspected Spam folder (or wherever you’re
filtering your spam) for false positives — good messages that
POPFile has erroneously mixed in with the junk. For each one,
go to the POPFile Control Center’s History page and find that
message (or click its X-POPFile-Link header, if your e-mail pro-
gram displays it). Reclassify the message from the Spam bucket
to the Inbox bucket. Similarly, if POPFile misses any spam and
it ends up in your inbox, reclassify it as spam.
Creating magnets for specific senders or text
If POPFile is having trouble guessing about some messages, you
can overrule it by creating a magnet — a rule that POPFile
applies before it starts using its own judgment about mes-
sages. For example, you may want to create magnets for the
people from whom you hear most often, directing messages
from these people into the Inbox folder regardless of their
content. This type of magnet tells POPFile, “Don’t bother look-
ing inside these messages because, based on the sender, I
want to read them no matter what.” You can also create mag-
nets for your Spam folder, indicating types of messages that
are always spam.
Chapter 11: A Round-Up of Desktop Antispam Programs 167

To create a magnet, follow these steps:
1. In your Web browser, go to the POPFile Control
Center at http://127.0.0.1:8080 and click the
Magnets link.
You see a list of current magnets, which is empty
unless you created some. POPFile doesn’t create mag-
nets on its own.
2. Scroll down to the Creating New Magnet section and
set the Magnet type to From (to specify by a sender’s
address), To (based on the addressee of the message),
or Subject (based on the Subject line of the message).
For example, to say that any message that talks about
debt reduction is spam, no matter what else it has in
it, select Subject.
3. In the Value box, type the address or text that you
want POPFile to match.
4. Set the Always Goes To bucket box to the bucket
where you want these messages to land.
5. Click the Create button.
A disadvantage of using a stand-alone program like POPFile is
that you can’t just say “If a message is from an address in my
e-mail program’s address book, never put it in the Spam
bucket.” Programs with built-in spam checkers can provide
this feature.
Adding Spam Bully to Outlook
and Outlook Express
Spam Bully is an add-in for Outlook and Outlook Express that
you can download from www.spambully.com. It’s not free, but
you can try it for free for a few weeks before deciding whether
to buy it. Spam Bully uses a number of approaches to spam
fighting, including
 Bayesian filtering (the method that POPFile uses).
 Bouncing messages back to spammers so that they think
your address is no good (usually useless because most
spammers don’t care).
Part III: Spam-Filtering Programs and Services 
168

 Whitelisting your friends’ addresses.
 Blacklisting spammer addresses.
 Sending challenge-response messages that reply to possi-
ble spam messages with a message to the sender, asking
them to confirm with a password. (This technique stops
spam, but annoys many real people who are trying to
send you mail and often ignore the challenge.)
After you download the program file from the Spam Bully Web
site, run the downloaded file to install it. Then, whenever you
run Outlook Express or Outlook, it includes the Spam Bully
add-in. The first time your e-mail program runs, Spam Bully
needs to look at your existing mail configuration, including the
mail messages that are already in your mail folders. When the
program is done, you see a new toolbar in your e-mail program.
(Figure 11-5 shows Spam Bully added to Outlook Express.)
Figure 11-5: Spam Bully adds a toolbar to Outlook Express and Outlook.
Separating spam from mail
with Spam Bully
The first time you get e-mail and Spam Bully gets to try out its
filtering prowess, it creates a mail folder named Spam and
moves spam messages there.
The first few times you get your e-mail, skim the messages in
your Inbox and look for spam that Spam Bully missed. If you
find any, click the Spam button on the new toolbar. Spam Bully
Chapter 11: A Round-Up of Desktop Antispam Programs 169

moves the message to your Spam folder and learns not to
miss that kind of message the next time.
Also, look at the messages in your Spam mailbox. At the
beginning, Spam Bully may misidentify lots of good messages
as spam. Select each one and click the Not Spam button.
To make Spam Bully take another look at messages in a mail
folder, select the folder and click the Process Folder button on
the toolbar. If your messages arrive from Hotmail or MSN or
an IMAP or Exchange account, you may need to click this
button each time mail arrives, to get spam out of your inbox.
If you have a folder that doesn’t contain any spam, you can
tell Spam Bully to learn from these messages. Open the folder,
click the Spam Bully button on the toolbar, and choose Learn
Folder As Regular Mail from the menu that appears.
Managing your black-and-white
lists
Spam Bully maintains three lists of e-mail addresses for you:
 Approved/Friends list: Messages from this whitelist of
addresses are never spam. Spam Bully adds addresses
to this list whenever you use the Not Spam button to
categorize messages.
 Banned/Spammers list: Messages from this blacklist of
address are always considered to be spam.
 Email addresses waiting to be approved: These
addresses have received a challenge e-mail from Spam
Bully, but have not yet responded.
You can see and edit these lists by clicking the Email Address
button on the Spam Bully toolbar.
Keeping Spam Bully under control
You can configure some Spam Bully settings by choosing
Tools➪Spam Bully Options. You see a dialog box with configu-
ration settings, as shown in Figure 11-6.
Part III: Spam-Filtering Programs and Services 
170

Figure 11-6: Configuring Spam Bully.
We don’t recommend selecting the Bounce Known Spam
Messages option because so many spammers forge their
return addresses anyway. Don’t select the Send Confirmation
Messages check box either, unless you want to annoy your
correspondents. Spam Bully should do an adequate job of cut-
ting down on your spam without these measures.
If you want to see impressive-looking graphs of how much of
your e-mail is spam, click the Spam Bully button on the tool-
bar and choose Statistics from the menu that appears.

Chapter 12
Antispam Services for
Just Plain Folks
In This Chapter
 How spam-filtering services work
 Services that riffle through the messages in your existing mailbox
 Mail addresses that are filtered
 Mail addresses that are disposable
You can depend on your ISP (Internet service provider)
and the software on your own PC to deal with spam —
that’s the approach we talk about in the preceding chapters of
this book. But we know another way, if you want to get seri-
ous about not getting any spam: You can subscribe to a vari-
ety of mail-filtering services.
Spam-filtering services fall into three general categories:
 Services that filter the mail inside your existing mailbox
 Services that provide a new address, filter mail sent to
that address, and then either forward the result to your
real address or let you pick it up with your e-mail program
 Services that let you create multiple addresses you can
hand out to potentially untrustworthy correspondents
and then discard addresses that get too much spam
Because most filtering services provide more than one kind of
service, we list them together in the following sidebar, “Some
spam-filtering services.”

Part III: Spam-Filtering Programs and Services 
174
Services that filter the mail in your existing mailbox work with
your existing e-mail address. The other two kinds involve set-
ting up a new address, or maybe lots of new addresses, at the
filtering company. The multiple address services create
addresses in addition to your regular address, so you may
find them interesting even if you don’t want to change your
main e-mail address.
Some of these services are free, but most charge a monthly or
annual fee. The paid services generally offer a way to try them
out for free — a limited version, a free first month before they
start charging, or a trial period during which you can cancel
and get your money back.
Some spam-filtering services
Here are a bunch of spam-filtering services to consider:
Cloudmark SpamNet, at www.cloudmark.com, is an add-in for Outlook and
Outlook Express that filters spam by using a shared database of spam 
“fingerprints.”
Despammed.com provides filtered e-mail, forwarded to your existing account
or Web mail. It’s free.
EMF Systems, at www.emailfiltering.co.uk (click the Home Users
link), offers POP proxy filtering.
Myrealbox, at www.myrealbox.com, provides filtered mail with POP, IMAP,
or Web mail. Myrealbox is offered for free by Novell, which uses it to test its
NetMail product.
Pobox, at www.pobox.com, offers a variety of mail-forwarding services,
including filtered addresses.
Spamcop, at www.spamcop.net, is mostly a spam-reporting service, and
also offers filtered e-mail addresses.
Spamex, at www.spamex.com, provides disposable e-mail addresses.
Spamgourmet, at www.spamgourmet.com, provides self-destructing,
disposable e-mail addresses. The service is free. It collects statistics on the
mail that gets discarded.

Filters for Your Existing Mailbox
A few filtering services apply themselves to your existing mail-
box. In some cases, the service acts as a POP proxy, which
means that you give the service the login details for your
e-mail mailbox (which must be stored on a POP server) and
you get your mail via the service. It periodically picks up your
mail, transfers it to its own system, and runs it through its fil-
ters. Then you pick up your nice, clean mail by either visiting
the Web site or setting up your mail program to retrieve it
from the service’s POP server rather than from your ISP’s.
Other filtering services provide a program that runs on your
PC, like stand-alone filtering software, but connects to the
service to get filter rules updates, checks whether particular
messages match entries in their collections of known spam,
and other tasks.
Here are some points to consider about this type of filtering
service:
 If keeping the same e-mail address you already have is
important, these services can supplant whatever filtering
your main mail provider has without requiring you to get
a new e-mail address.
 POP proxies delay your mail a little because you can’t get
your mail any faster than their system can pick it up from
your original mailbox.
 Make sure that a service is trustworthy before you give it
the keys to your real mailbox. (We haven’t heard of any
problems, but the possibility of trouble, either deliberate
or accidental, is there.)
Filtered Mail Addresses
Many services offer filtered e-mail addresses, or mailboxes with
spam-filtering built-in. You sign up for a filtered mail address
the same way you sign up for a Web mail account like Hotmail
Chapter 12: Antispam Services for Just Plain Folks 175

or MSN or Yahoo! Mail, except that instead of (or in addition to)
providing Web mail, the service either provides a POP server
where you can pick up mail with your regular e-mail program or
forwards the filtered mail to your existing e-mail address. Some
services forward all your messages (spam and all), tagging the
spam so that you can sort it in your mail program. Other serv-
ices keep the spam on their servers so that you can check it
over the Web, and others just throw the spam away.
Here’s a good way to use a filtered mail address: If your existing
address doesn’t get much spam, keep using it and give that
address only to friends and family. When you need to provide
your e-mail address to anyone else, give the filtered mail
address. This system does require that you check your mes-
sages in two e-mail accounts, but most e-mail programs handle
multiple POP accounts. Be sure to choose a filtered mail serv-
ice with a POP server, and then set up your e-mail program to
collect your messages for both accounts. You can keep mes-
sages from your friends and family members separate from
your filtered mail. Just be sure to use the right return address
when you send mail!

Filter and fight spam at the same time
at the SpamCon Foundation
The SpamCon Foundation is a donor-
supported antispam organization
run by friends of ours. On a shoe-
string budget, it publishes a free
newsletter, maintains online libraries
of resources, and sponsors an occa-
sional conference.
One way to support the foundation is
to subscribe to its spam-filtering
services. It offers Postini-filtered mail-
boxes (as described in Chapter 13),
ClicVU disposable e-mail addresses,
and more. The price is about the same
as you would pay anywhere else, and
you support SpamCon at the same
time. Visit www.spamcon.org and
click the Filtered or Disposable mail
links on the left side of the home
page. SpamCon lists, along with its
own services, other mail-filtering
services it knows about, so it’s a good
place to check regardless of whether
you plan to use its filters.

If you use Outlook or Outlook Express for your mail program,
you can use Hotmail or MSN as a filtered mail account because
both programs can work directly with a Hotmail or MSN
account. Or, if your favorite mail program is Netscape 7 or
AOL Communicator, you can use an AOL account as your fil-
tered mail address. (If that’s your main use for AOL, you can
switch to the $5-per-month plan. This plan includes only three
hours of online time, but because sending and receiving mail
through Netscape or Communicator don’t count as online
time, three hours is plenty.)
Lots of Mail Addresses
Disposable e-mail addresses let you give different addresses to
each potentially untrustworthy correspondent. Every time
you order stuff from a new store online, you can give the
vendor a new e-mail address. All the addresses land in the
same mailbox; either they arrive in a POP mailbox provided
by the filtering service or they’re forwarded to your regular
address. For example, you may give the address elvis-
123@example.com when you buy items from a bookstore and
elvis-456@example.com when you buy caviar (as you often
do, we’re sure). Mail to both these addresses lands in your
elvis@example.com mailbox.
If you find that one of your disposable addresses starts get-
ting more spam than you want, you just turn that address off.
John has long done something similar (he runs his own mail
server, which made it easy to set up): He gives a unique
address each time he has to provide one when ordering some-
thing online or otherwise giving an address to someone new.
Although he has found that he hasn’t needed to dispose of
many of them, it’s still often handy to see which address a
dubious piece of mail was sent to, and usually to say “Ah, now
I remember — I gave them that address.”
Your ISP may provide something like disposable addresses
automatically. Most ISPs let you set up anywhere from five to
eight addresses per account, and they let you throw away an
address and set up a new one as often as you want. You can
also often use subaddresses, such as fred-xyz@myisp.com
Chapter 12: Antispam Services for Just Plain Folks 177

or fred+xyz@myisp.com if your address is fred@myisp.com.
Check with your ISP; in many cases the ISP’s mail system han-
dles subaddresses automatically. You can’t turn them off, but
you can usually arrange to filter mail based on the subaddress
in your mail program. (See Part II of this book to find out how
to filter or sort mail in your e-mail program.)

I
f you run a mail server, you should run spam-filtering soft-
ware for the benefit of your users. Server-side filtering has
both technical and, shall we say, social advantages:
 Server filters can do a better job than user filters (filters
on the user’s computer) because the server has access
to the entire stream of incoming mail.
 Spam and virus filtering can often be done at the same
time.
 If the filters reject mail or divert mail into a separate
mailbox on the server, users don’t have to download mail
that they’re only going to throw away.
 Users don’t have to install their own filtering software.
 You don’t have to try to support 17 different random
filtering programs that users download off the Net.

Part III: Spam-Filtering Programs and Services 
180
Server Filtering Techniques
In Chapter 1, we mention three general filtering techniques:
whitelists, blacklists, and message filters. When you run the
filter on your mail server, some techniques become practical
that aren’t when they’re applied individually by users. A server
filter should be able to use these techniques, individually or in
combination:
 IP address filtering: The filter tests the numeric IP
address from which the mail arrives, to reject mail from
known problem addresses. Most filters let you set IP
address ranges to blacklist or whitelist directly, but using
shared blacklists and whitelists distributed via the Net’s
Domain Name System (DNS) is much more common.
 Bulk counting: The essence of spam is that a whole lot of
it is out there. Bulk counting filters look at incoming mail
to try to recognize when many similar messages are
arriving.
 Timing techniques and greylists: Filters can often detect
spam by looking at peculiarities of the rate at which it
arrives.
 Body filters: These filters look at the contents of the
spam, just like desktop filters do. Because the server filter
can see all incoming mail, not just one user’s, Bayesian
and other adaptive techniques can use a larger sample
base.
The next three sections explore these types of filtering in
more detail.
DNS blacklists and whitelists
One of the most effective server filtering techniques is to reject
mail based on its sending IP address. Because the IP address is
known at the beginning of the incoming mail connection, a
server can use IP rejection to refuse even to receive a message,
which is much faster than receiving and then discarding mail.
Conversely, if a message is coming from an IP that’s known
to send no spam, the mail system can bypass the rest of the
filters.

The standard way to distribute shared lists of IP addresses is
a DNSBL (DNS–based list). The original DNSBL was Paul Vixie’s
Realtime Blackhole List (RBL), but now hundreds of DNSBLs
are out there, ranging from widely used professional lists to
tiny, sloppily run personal lists.
DNSBLs work by making up a domain name for every 
possible IP address. If the address you want to check is
169.254.100.5 and the DNSBL is spam.services.net, the
filter reverses the order of the components in the IP address
and looks up this address in the DNS system:
5.100.254.169.spam.services.net
If that name exists in the DNS entry, the address is in the
DNSBL. (The reverse order makes it easier for a DNSBL to
handle ranges of addresses.)
Because DNS lookups are quite fast, filters can use DNSBLs to
check the IP address of each incoming mail message at the
moment the sending system connects to the mail server.
Popular DNSBLs include the ones in this list:
 Spamhaus Block List (SBL), at www.spamhaus.org/sbl:
The most widely used DNSBL in the world; lists verified
high-volume spam sources. It blocks lots of spam sent by
professional spammers.
 Composite Blocking List (CBL), at cbl.abuseat.org: An
automatically maintained list of sources of verified spam.
This list blocks lots of spam sent through open proxies
and other hijacked machines.
 Relay Stop List (RSL), at relays.visi.com: An automati-
cally maintained list of verified, insecure open relays with
a history of sending spam.
 Open Relay DataBase (ORDB), at www.ordb.org:
Another open relay list, more aggressive than RSL.
 Not Just Another Bogus List (NJABL), at njabl.org: 
A combination list of open relays, proxies, dial-ups, and
spam sources. It’s more aggressive than RSL and ORDB,
but still fairly reliable.
Chapter 13: Server-Side Spam Filtering for Network Administrators 181

 Easynet lists at abuse.easynet.nl: DNSBLs of spam
sources, insecure open proxies, and dial-up and similar
dynamically assigned addresses that shouldn’t be sending
mail directly, maintained by a large ISP in the Netherlands.
 SpamCop Blocking List, at spamcop.net/bl.shtml: An
aggressive list of spam sources driven by user reports.
This list blocks a great deal of spam, but because it has a
much higher error rate than other DNSBLs in this list, it’s
useful only as a component of a scoring filter.
 MAPS RBL PLUS and related lists from www.mail-abuse.
org: The descendant of the original RBL; includes the
RBL (spam sources), DUL (dial-up and dynamic address
ranges), RSS (open relays), and OPL (open proxies). These
lists require a license from MAPS to use, and their prices
range from $0 for small private networks to $10,000 per
year for large corporations and ISPs.
Bulk counting
One of the most effective approaches to recognizing spam on a
server is bulk counting. Each time a message arrives, the filter
makes a hash (compressed) code representing the contents of
the message and looks in a database to see how many other
messages have arrived recently with the same hash code. If it’s
several, the message is probably spam. Because spammers
tend to mutate their messages to avoid bulk counting filters,
effective bulk counters also make “fuzzy” hash codes designed
to disregard minor differences between one copy of a message
and another. Bulk counters recognize bulk mail from legitimate
mailing lists as well as spam, so any bulk counting system
needs to be configured to whitelist known legitimate mail,
usually based on the return address, the sending IP, and a
whitelist of the hash codes of mailing list messages.
Bulk counting doesn’t need to be restricted to a single mail
server. The best bulk counting systems exchange hash code
information among many servers.
The premier bulk counting system is the Distributed Checksum
Clearinghouse, at www.dcc-servers.net, which coordinates
a network of more than 150 servers that check more than 50
Part III: Spam-Filtering Programs and Services 
182

million messages a day. Although networks that handle small
amounts of mail (fewer than about 50,000 messages a day) are
welcome to use the public DCC servers, larger mail users
should arrange to run their own DCC server.
Timing and greylists
Most spam is sent by specialized spamware that blasts out
mail as fast as possible without checking for errors rather
than by normal mail software. Viruses and worms often skip
the error checking too. Spamware and viruses frequently can
be detected by looking for timing peculiarities caused by the
lack of error checking.
The mail server and the sending host normally exchange mes-
sages in lockstep, with the sending host sending a command,
the server replying with a status message, the sending host
sending another command, and so on. Because the sequence
of commands and status messages is completely predictable
for successful message delivery, spamware often sends all
the commands without waiting for the replies. The server
can check to see whether the sending computer is getting
ahead of the replies, and if so, reliably conclude that the mail
is coming from spamware or a virus rather than from a real
mail client.
Another timing trick available to servers is greylisting. If a mail
server is short of disk space or is otherwise suffering from
problems that temporarily keep it from receiving mail, it can
return temporary error status codes to attempts to send it
mail. Real mail programs retry the message a little later, but
viruses and spamware don’t bother. The idea of greylisting is
that when a server sees an incoming message from a hitherto
unknown server, the server returns a temporary error mes-
sage and remembers the sender’s IP address along with the
sender and recipient addresses of the temporarily rejected
message. If the sender retries the same message reasonably
soon — recognized by the same IP, sender, and recipient —
the server accepts it and also accepts future mail from that IP
without delays. If not, the server continues to send temporary
rejections to mail from that IP. Experiments show that this
process delays about 4 percent of legitimate mail for an hour
Chapter 13: Server-Side Spam Filtering for Network Administrators 183

or so (most mail comes from IP addresses that have sent mail
before) while rejecting nearly all mail sent by spamware.
Both these tricks have to be implemented in mail server soft-
ware because only the server knows the timing of incoming
mail. Greylisting is not yet widely used, but the DCC software
can be configured to do greylisting as well as bulk counting.
Approaches to Combination
Filtering
For spam filters that use multiple tests (all the effective ones),
you have two different ways to handle the multiple tests:
sequentially or by scoring.
 Some filters apply tests sequentially, typically doing their
IP tests first as the remote host connects and then their
bulk tests and then their body tests. If any of the tests
categorizes a message as spam, the filter stops and
doesn’t do any more testing on that message.
 Scoring filters, on the other hand, run all their tests, assign
a weight to each test, and add (or otherwise average) the
weights of the tests that the message passed. If the score
is above a threshold level, the message is considered to
be spam. (See the section “Filtering on Unix and Linux
Servers,” later in this chapter, for an example of scoring
using SpamAssassin.)
Sequential filters can be much faster because they often don’t
need to run the full set of tests, but they’re harder to tune
than scoring filters. A hybrid approach is often most effective.
On our mail servers, we test at connection-time some conser-
vative DNSBLs with low false positive rates (currently SBL,
CBL, Easynet, MAPS, and a private local list) and reject any
addresses they list. Then we use SpamAssassin on the mail we
do accept for its scoring filters. The connection-time filters
reject between 40 percent and 50 percent of incoming mail
attempts, with a corresponding drop in the amount of mail
that SpamAssassin has to handle.

If You Use Windows Server
and Exchange
Starting from a weak base, Microsoft has improved the secu-
rity of its Exchange mail server in each version so that
Exchange 2003, along with the SMTP server in recent versions
of the IIS Web server, can be configured to be fairly secure.
Neither Exchange nor IIS includes built-in spam filtering, but
they have provisions for plug-in filters.
Dozens of vendors offer filtering software, most of which com-
bines spam filtering with virus filtering, which on a Windows
system is at least as essential as spam filtering. Some filtering
products are shown in this list:
 Brightmail (www.brightmail.com); see the section “But,
Does It Make Toast?” later in this chapter.
 GFI Mail Essentials (www.gfisoftware.com).
 Hexamail Guard (www.hexamail.com).
 MailMarshal (www.mailmarshal.com).
 Mail Storage Guard (www.mapilab.com).
 Symantec AntiVirus for SMTP Gateways (www.
symantec.com).
Different versions of Exchange (versions 5.5 to 2003), as well
as Lotus Domino and other groupware packages, require dif-
ferent versions of antispam and antivirus packages. Visit the
vendors’ Web sites to see whether they support the version
you’re using.
Microsoft Exchange isn’t the only mail server available for
Windows. More secure alternatives support the Outlook cal-
endar and groupware features while providing better e-mail
handling and filtering. Take a look at Communigate Pro, from
Stalker Software, at www.stalker.com.
Chapter 13: Server-Side Spam Filtering for Network Administrators 185

Filtering on Unix and
Linux Servers
Internet e-mail grew up on Unix servers, so it’s not surprising
that a wide variety of both e-mail software and filtering add-
ons are available for Unix and Linux. Nearly all of them are
open source or freeware.
The most widely used Unix/Linux mail server is the venerable
sendmail program, which has been around for more than 20
years. Not surprisingly, it has provisions to plug in many sorts
of mail filters, with direct support for DNSBLs and a milter
(mail filter) framework to run other sorts of filters as mail is
received. Other popular mail servers (including exim, postfix,
and qmail) also support DNSBLs and have varying degrees of
support for receipt-time filtering.
Unix/Linux mail systems usually also use procmail, a popular
filtering package that runs as mail is being delivered to local
mailboxes. Procmail has its own pattern-matching language
that has been used to write filters such as Spambouncer
(available at www.spambouncer.org), and it can run other
programs, the usual way to run other filters.
By far the most popular Unix/Linux filter is SpamAssassin, at
spamassassin.org. This effective scoring filter can use
DNSBLs, DCC, and Razor (another shared hash counting
system), along with fixed, heuristic, and Bayesian filters.
SpamAssassin runs each message through all the tests it’s
configured to use, computes a spamminess score, and adds a
report to the message header. Here’s a full-detail report for a
typical piece of spam that SpamAssassin caught:

Our copy of SpamAssassin is set up to tag as spam anything
that scores higher than 6.0; this message scored 24.7, which is
extremely high. (Into the trash with it!)
SpamAssassin is most often run from procmail when mail is
delivered, and less often as mail is received. Regardless of when
SpamAssassin runs, it adds its report and usually marks the
Subject line of tagged messages with *****SPAM*****. System
Chapter 13: Server-Side Spam Filtering for Network Administrators 187

managers — and in some cases, users — can easily configure
the mail system to deliver tagged spam to a separate mailbox
or even to discard it.
Quite a bit of other antispam software is available for
Unix/Linux, most of which works in conjunction with
SpamAssassin:
 DCC, from www.dcc-servers.net: Client and server
software for the DCC bulk counting system. This program
can be used via a sendmail milter, at delivery time from
procmail, or from SpamAssassin.
 amavisd-new, from www.ijs.si/software/amavisd: 
A package that runs spam and virus filters from mail
servers. Amavisd-new can call both SpamAssassin and an
antivirus package, such as Clamav, from sendmail and
other mail servers. (The original amavis is just a virus-
scanning framework without spam filtering.)
 Vipul’s Razor, from razor.sourceforge.net: A collabo-
rative spam-filtering system, sort of like DCC. Rather than
perform pure bulk counting, Razor accepts user submis-
sions of spam and maintains a database of hash codes of
reported spam. It’s now usually used via SpamAssassin
or the commercial Cloudmark service.
 Maia Mailguard, at www.renaissoft.com/projects/
maia: A Web console for amavisd-new that lets users
adjust the way their mail is filtered.
But, Does It Make Toast?
Because spam filtering is a complex and CPU-intensive appli-
cation, you may want to consider dedicating a separate server
to it. Many vendors offer antispam appliances already config-
ured with antispam software that logically sits between the
Internet and the existing mail server. The network mail config-
uration is adjusted so that incoming mail goes to the appliance,
which examines the mail and remails the filtered mail to the
existing mail server. Some appliances are physically installed
next to the mail servers they support, and others sit at the
vendor’s site, passing filtered mail over the Internet.
Part III: Spam-Filtering Programs and Services 
188

Many vendors sell appliances containing versions of
SpamAssassin, amavisd, DCC, Linux or other freeware Unix,
and other freeware antispam software. We suggest that if
that’s the software you want, you’re better off taking an old PC
and hiring someone knowledgeable to set it up with filtering
software so that you know what you have.
Spam-filtering appliances with software beyond what’s avail-
able for free are sold by Network Associates, Symantec,
Computer Associates, and a plethora of smaller companies.
Third-Party Services
Some vendors that offer software and services beyond the
familiar freeware offerings are described in this list:
 Brightmail, at brightmail.com: Provides a subscription-
filtering system that uses continually updated filter rules
maintained by the Brightmail staff. Available as an appli-
ance or as an Exchange add-on, it’s used by several big
ISPs and corporations that can afford the extra hardware
it can sometimes require.
 Postini, at www.postini.com: Offers a filtering service.
Incoming mail is routed to the Postini servers, which
then forward the filtered mail to the customer’s mail
system. Postini is a popular choice of many small ISPs
that don’t mind outsourcing a key service like e-mail.
 Spam Squelcher, at spamsquelcher.com: Serves as a
traffic-shaping appliance rather than a spam filter.
Functioning like a network router, it sits at the edge of
your network and passes all the data through to your
servers. But when it sees network paths that are sending
you spam, it uses a feature of the Transmission Control
Protocol (the TCP in TCP/IP) to control, or squelch, the
rate at which data packets can leave the spammer’s com-
puter. Although it passes all incoming mail through to the
mail server eventually, good mail gets through faster.
Because spamware tends to give up if mail is delayed,
delayed spam tends to disappear and any misidentified
real mail eventually gets through. On the downside,
SpamSquelcher is appropriate only for ISPs and enter-
prises with more than a few thousand e-mail users.
Chapter 13: Server-Side Spam Filtering for Network Administrators 189

A Checklist for Server
Spam Filters
No matter what kind of server spam filter you decide on, make
sure that it offers all these features:
 Regular updates to handle improvements in spam recog-
nition and the latest spammer tricks
 Multiple filtering techniques, including IP-based, fixed
body filters, adaptive (Bayesian) body filters, bulk
counting, and greylists
 System-wide and per-user configuration to deal with indi-
vidual preferences, false positives, and new spam variants

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
N
o For Dummies book is complete without “The Part
of Tens.” Here, you’ll ﬁnd two useful collections of
information: a list of spam-based scams to avoid (or to
make fun of your friends for believing) and our top ten
Internet annoyances and what to do about them.

Chapter 14
Ten Spam Scams
In This Chapter
 Lose money in lots of different ways!
 Poison yourself!
 Persuade your friends that you’re a sucker!
O
ne of the few things you can count on when you get
spammed is that whatever it claims to be offering, it’s
not for real. Herewith, we offer some of the greatest hits in
spam scams.
Help Steal Millions from
an African Country
Probably the best-developed spam scam is the 419 scam,
named after the section of Nigerian law that makes it illegal.
You receive an urgent message, most often from Nigeria, but
sometimes from other countries in Africa or occasionally else-
where. Your correspondent urgently needs your help to spirit
away millions of dollars that are tied up in an account belong-
ing to a deceased general or a crooked official at the national
oil company. You will be well rewarded with a large percent-
age of the take.
What’s going on? Well, before you can get your hands on the
loot, a few details need to be worked out, officials need to be
bribed, marker dye must be washed off the cash, and you
need to send only a small advance to get things going. As we
hope should be obvious, the millions are a fantasy, and if
you’re so foolish as to send the advance, that’s the last you
ever see of your money. What’s astonishing is that people fall
for this scam all the time, with individual losses up to hundreds

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
194
of thousands of dollars and a total annual take in the billions,
making it one of the largest industries in Nigeria. People occa-
sionally go to Nigeria to try to recover their money. The lucky
ones come back broke but alive. Some don’t come back at all.
Although this advance fee scam has been perfected in the
modern era in Nigeria, in its earlier form it was known as the
Spanish prisoner, with the story that a rich nobleman was in
prison in Spain and if you would front the money to bribe his
way home, he would repay you tenfold and his beautiful
daughter would show her appreciation, if you know what we
mean. (For suckers with morals, an alternative version prom-
ised her hand in marriage.) This scam has been traced back to
the 1500s, telling us that neither greed, nor gullibility, is a
recent invention.
Make Lots of Money 
with No Work
Just call this toll-free number and you’re on the road to
riches. Or, more likely, to the poorhouse. The Federal Trade
Commission says that these scams usually turn out to be 
illegal pyramid schemes, a well-known and completely illegal
type of scam. The nature of pyramid schemes is to vacuum
money upward from the suckers at the bottom of the pyramid
toward the crooks at the top who started it. Needless to say,
you start at the bottom.
Other versions are envelope-stuffing schemes (where the
envelopes you stuff are full of more ads to even more suckers
offering to sell them the same envelope-stuffing scam) or
spam telling you that you can make tons of money if you buy
the spammer’s guaranteed path to riches by sending even
more spam (which, of course, is the same spam you’re sup-
posed to sell to another generation of suckers).
You’ve Won a Free Vacation
Wow, you’ve won a free vacation to Disney World or the
Bahamas! Let’s go! Well, you may have to pay a modest charge
for postage and handling, only slightly more than what the
plane tickets would normally cost. And the hotel is a dump, if

it even exists, and before you can check in, you have to sit
through a high-pressure time-share sales presentation. And
rooms are available only on Tuesdays and Wednesdays in
November.
You can certainly find reasonably priced vacation packages to
Florida and other places, but you find them on reputable
travel Web sites, like Orbitz and Travelocity or on the travel
pages of your local paper, not in spam.
Verify Your Account — Not!
Your ISP sends you an e-mail message saying that it’s having a
problem with your credit card, so for verification purposes
please fill out a form with your account name, password,
address, card number, and expiration date. Or, maybe the
message comes from a familiar commerce site, like eBay or
Amazon.com.
Real ISPs and Web sites never, ever, send mail like this. In the
unlikely event that one of them has a problem with your
credit card, someone there may send you a paper letter and
ask you to call. The spam, some of which uses extremely
authentic-looking graphics (swiped from the real Web site,
natch!), sends your info back to the spammer, who then veri-
fies your credit card by buying a whole bunch of stuff and
charging it to you.
This scam — pretending to be someone with whom you do
business to steal your account info or credit card details — is
known to aficionados as phishing. Don’t take the bait.
Get Free Cable or Satellite TV
Who wants to pay $40 every month for cable TV and even
more for premium channels? When you get spam offering to
sell you plans for a cable descrambler or the descrambler
itself, is this an opportunity to $ave big buck$? Of course not,
for the obvious reason that it doesn’t work. A long, long time
ago, some cable systems used simple scrambling schemes
that could be defeated by gizmos built from parts bought at
Radio Shack, but unless your cable box dates from about
1975, they don’t work any more.
Chapter 14: Ten Spam Scams 195

One thing you may be looking forward to is a visit from the
cops. Stealing cable TV service is illegal, and if your cable
company can detect that you’re trying to do it, it isn’t
amused.
Repair Your Bad Credit
This scam comes in a variety of versions: Clean up your credit
report or get a brand-new credit report, get a guaranteed
credit card, or otherwise cast aside the burden of bad debt.
In its simplest form, you pay someone to do the whammy on
your credit report and that person takes your money and dis-
appears. (Simple and elegant, isn’t it?) Or, someone may tell
you to get a business ID number from the IRS and use that
number rather than your Social Security number to apply 
for credit, a clever idea that fools credit issuers and credit
bureaus for, oh, the better part of three seconds. (Someone
has already tried it? Gosh, what a surprise.)
The credit card may be a secured card for which you pay a
$500 cash deposit and get a card with a high annual fee, a
higher interest rate, and a $350 credit limit, which kind of
stretches the definition of credit. Or, someone offers you a
“gold card,” good only for buying overpriced junk from their
own catalog.
If you have credit problems, your best bet is probably to get
from the library a book that tells you how to make a budget
and work out payment plans with creditors. Or, you may have
a reputable nonprofit credit counseling organization in your
community. But fix your credit via spam? We don’t think so.
Become Thin and Beautiful
Lose weight, grow more hair in desirable places, erase your
zits, and otherwise become just like all those thin and beauti-
ful people you see on TV by taking our guaranteed herbal
nostrums.
You have already guessed: They don’t work. The only thing we
can guarantee is that if you send them your money, it’s gone.
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
196 Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Get Drugs Without a
Prescription, Cheap
This scam is the brand-name variant of the one in the preced-
ing section. Need Vicodin, Vioxx, Propecia, human growth
hormone, or (how did humankind ever live without it?)
Viagra? No problem — we have whatever you need. No pre-
scription? No problem! We have unethical doctors who can
write you a prescription sight unseen, or we can just skip that
step and ship it to you, maybe from our Canadian supplier or
from a shipment that fell off a truck in Pakistan, or we may
just compress talcum powder into pill shapes.
What’s the hitch? Surely you don’t think that if you send these
guys money, they send you real prescription drugs that nor-
mally cost anywhere from $10 to $100 a dose, even in foreign
countries. What can you do if they don’t? You can hardly call
the cops and complain, “I sent them money to buy drugs ille-
gally without a prescription, but all they sent me was a bottle
full of wood shavings from a hamster cage”?
For people who need the same prescription filled every
month, legitimate mail-order pharmacies indeed have good
prices. But they don’t advertise with spam.
Make, Uh, Your Body 
Parts Bigger
You know what we mean. (In the unlikely event that you don’t,
refer to the fake Viagra in the preceding section and use your
imagination.) For any individual spam, you have about a 50
percent chance of even having the part it’s offering to expand;
if you do, the nostrums range from exercises to herbal potions
to stick-on patches. (Ouch!)
One report we read said that a journalist bought a bunch of
different enlargement nostrums from a spammer, had them
analyzed, and despite the fact that their alleged purposes and
effects were quite different, they were all the same stuff. The
Chapter 14: Ten Spam Scams 197

main active ingredient that was found was E. coli bacteria, a
hint that perhaps the manufacturers should have washed
their hands before they started mixing.
This scam is amazingly successful. At a meeting of state attor-
neys general that Ray attended, the Arizona attorney general’s
office reported that it had recovered about $30 million from
enlargement scammers and was prepared to refund it to dis-
satisfied customers. Few requests were received, presumably
because not many people are prepared to say “My, um, you
know, is still too small, and I’m really gullible.”
Free Porn
Porn spam often says that it’s free, free, FREE! Get all the porn
you want for FREE! Click here and you’re on your way.
Wait! We wouldn’t want to expose any innocent children to
our heavy breathing, even though the spam itself already
exposed quite a bit. To make sure that you’re a mature adult
over 21, we just need to verify your credit card number. Don’t
worry — even though we have your name, address, and credit
card number, we would never dream of charging anything to
your card. Yeah, right.
A variation requires you to download a free “viewer” program.
What you don’t know is that this viewer program causes your
computer to dial in to the Internet via an international long-
distance number at exorbitant rates.

M
ost Internet users feel that spam is the bane of their
Internet experience — some people have even quit
using e-mail because of spam. The level of unpleasantness
that spam injects into the Internet experience is just too high
to be worth it for them.
However, spam is far from the only annoyance about the
Internet. This chapter lists some other pain-in-the-neck
aspects of the Internet and ways to avoid them. If you have
your spam problem under control, why put up with browser
pop-ups, viruses, adware, and other annoyances?

Part IV: The Part of Tens
200
Squashing Browser Pop-Ups
Years ago, some clever Web programmer invented a way for a
Web page to open additional browser windows. It wasn’t a bad
invention at first because, sometimes, working with several
browser windows at the same time is convenient. However,
marketing slimeballs have seized on the idea, and new win-
dows now pop up continually, usually with annoying ads.
You have two ways to deal with browser pop-ups:
 Use a browser that blocks pop-ups.
 Install a pop-up blocker utility.
Netscape Navigator 7 and Mozilla can block pop-ups them-
selves. Choose Edit➪Preferences, double-click the Privacy &
Security category to open it (unless its subcategories are
already visible), and select the Popup Windows category, as
shown in Figure 15-1. Select the Block Unrequested Popup
Windows check box (it’s selected by default). If you want to
allow pop-ups from specific sites (for example, if an online
game you enjoy uses pop-ups), click the Allowed Sites button
and add the address of the Web site. AOL users have a pop-up
blocker button at the bottom of their browser windows.
Figure 15-1: Netscape 7 and Mozilla have built-in pop-up stoppers.

If you insist on using Internet Explorer, many third-party pop-
up stoppers are available. Many are free, or you can pay good
money for programs that are no better than the free ones. 
We like the Google toolbar, which you can download from
toolbar.google.com. The Google toolbar appears in
Internet Explorer just below the Address box, with a box for
Google-searching the Web directly from the toolbar. It also
adds pop-up blocking and form-fill-ins to your browser. The
Blocked button on the toolbar (shown in Figure 15-2 as 2
blocked) indicates how many pop-ups Google has blocked for
this Web site. To allow pop-ups from a site, click the button.
Figure 15-2: The Google toolbar.
Some other pop-up stoppers to consider are the shareware
programs CoffeCup PopUp Blocker (www.coffeecup.com/
software), Pop-Up Stopper (www.panicware.com), and
STOPzilla (www.stopzilla.com).
And now, a word from our lawyer, who in this case is also our
co-author, Ray: Yes, pop-up ads on Web sites can be annoying,
but when you choose to block those advertisements, you’re
cutting into the method by which that Web site pays its bills.
Some Web sites let you do away with annoying advertising, for
a price. So, before you go blocking the occasional annoying ad,
ask yourself how much you would pay to access that same site.
If everybody blocks ads and the site earns no advertising rev-
enue, you may end up asking that question for real. Remember:
If your computer is infected with adware or spyware, the pop-
up ads you see all the time may not even be the fault of the Web
site you’re visiting. Shutting them down may make the legiti-
mate pop-up ads far less frequent and much less annoying.
Protecting Your System 
from Intruders
A firewall controls what kinds of information can pass between
your computer and the rest of the world. If your computer
connects directly to the Internet (rather than to a local-area
network, or LAN, that connects to the Internet), you need a
firewall between you and the Net.
Chapter 15: Ten Internet Annoyances 201

Windows XP comes with the Internet Connection Firewall. If
you use the New Connection Wizard to set up your Internet
connection, you can turn it on; in fact, the firewall is on by
default. Here’s how to check whether it’s on and turn it on if
it’s off:
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Network And Internet
Connections➪Network Connections.
You see the Network Connections window. Your
Internet connection should appear in the Dial-Up or
LAN or High-Speed Internet sections of the window.
2. Right-click to select your Internet connection and
choose Properties from the menu that appears.
3. Select the Advanced tab on the Properties dialog
box, as shown in Figure 15-3.
The tab contains two sections: Internet Connection
Firewall and Internet Connection Sharing.
4. If the check box labeled “Protect My Computer And
Network By Limiting Or Preventing Access To This
Computer From The Internet isn’t selected, click to
select it.
That’s all there is to it — you have no settings to
configure.
5. Click OK.
Figure 15-3: Turning on the Internet Connection Firewall in Windows XP.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
202

If your computer is on a LAN, don’t turn on the Internet
Connection Firewall, which blocks file- and printer-sharing 
on the LAN.
Don’t Let Viruses In
Anyone who doesn’t run a virus checker on an Internet-
connected computer is just asking for trouble. To find out
everything you ever wanted to know about fighting back
against viruses, pick up a copy of Internet Privacy For Dummies,
written by two of the authors of this book (and published by
Wiley Publishing, Inc.). But before you run back to the book-
store or log on to your favorite book-selling Web site, go to one
of these Web sites and install one of these fine products:
 Norton AntiVirus (www.symantec.com/nav)
 McAfee VirusScan (www.mcafee.com)
 Grisoft AVG (www.grisoft.com)
 F-Prot (www.fprot.org)
You can usually buy the software right there online and down-
load it immediately, in addition to having a CD mailed to you.
You can also get free trial versions that can help you cope
with an urgent infection, in the event of an emergency.
Make sure to subscribe to the continuing-update services.
The antivirus companies aren’t just trying to wheedle more
money out of you. (That’s just a fringe benefit!) Really, though,
new viruses appear all the time, and your virus checker needs
to know about them in order to spot them. Last year’s un-
updated antivirus software is almost as bad as no antivirus
software.
A few spam-filtering programs have built-in virus checkers. If
you use a stand-alone spam filter, check to see whether it also
scans for viruses.
Chapter 15: Ten Internet Annoyances 203

Checking for Spyware 
and Adware
You can’t always tell when you’re downloading and installing
software. Sometimes, programs sneak in when you click a link
or button, or they arrive bundled with another program.
These sneaky programs may contain viruses, may use your
computer for their own purposes, and may report back to
Mission Control with information about what you’re doing. At
other times, they may just pop up an advertisement while
you’re trying to surf around Web sites.
Programs that report back to their makers to tattle on the
things you do and the places you go are spyware. Programs
that contain advertising pop-ups or other advertisement-
display mechanisms are adware.
Not all spyware is malicious. For example, Windows Media
Player checks in with its home base whenever you click the
Media Guide button or ask for information about an album.
Other spyware may have more nefarious goals, such as telling
the mother ship whenever you’re shopping for a home
mortgage.
Adware is often bundled in with some other piece of software
that you’re interested in using. Many music-stealing programs,
like KaZaA and BearShare, have adware features that are
responsible for many of the pop-up advertisements you see. So,
if your kids are engaged in the federal crime of copyright theft
and have installed software for doing it, that software may also
be responsible for those annoying pop-up ads you’re seeing.
Adware and spyware also have a darker side. Some adware
companies also pay Web sites to surreptitiously install their
adware whenever you visit that site. Still other adware gets
installed while you’re getting a “free gift” downloaded by
a Web site. The gift may be a speed accelerator for your 
dial-up connection or some handy-dandy calendar or clock-
synchronizing program. Unless you and your lawyer read the
fine print (assuming that you can even find it), those free gifts
are much like the famous Trojan horse — it looks fun but is
really full of bad news!

Here are a few programs that can scan your computer for
adware and spyware and remove what they find:
 Ad-aware (www.lavasoft.de/software/adaware)
 Spybot Search and Destroy (spybot.eon.net.au)
 SpywareGuard (www.wilderssecurity.net/
spywareguard.html)
 Webroot Spy Sweeper (www.webroot.com/wb/
products/spysweeper)
To learn more about how spyware and adware work and how
to beat the privacy invaders at their own game, read Internet
Privacy For Dummies, another fine yellow book by Wiley
Publishing, Inc., written by two of your co-authors.
Don’t Limit Yourself 
to One Web Page
The vast majority of Internet users use their Web browsers
like this:
1. Open the browser to take up the entire screen.
2. Type an address or click a link.
3. Read stuff on the page.
4. Go back to Step 2.
If you want to go back to a page you were looking at a few min-
utes ago, you use the Back button or History list. And, while
you’re waiting for one page to load, you have nothing else to
look at.
Why display only one Web page at a time? Almost all browsers
can display lots of Web pages, each in a separate window.
Some browsers can display multiple pages in one window,
using either tabs or subwindows.
To open additional windows in your browser, press Ctrl+N or
choose File➪New➪Window (this command works in almost
all browsers). To switch from window to window, click in it.
Chapter 15: Ten Internet Annoyances 205

Each window acts like a separate browser. Another way to
open a new window is to right-click a link and choose Open in
New Window from the menu that appears.
For example, if you’re searching for information on the Web,
you can use Google or another search engine to find a list of
possibly useful sites. You can keep this list on-screen and
open each site in a separate window.
Netscape 7 and Mozilla (our favorite browsers) can display lots
of Web pages in one window by showing them on separate
tabs. Press Ctrl+T to open a new tab in your browser window.
You can open a bunch of tabs, as shown in Figure 15-4. To close
a tab, click the X button to the right of the tabs. To switch from
tab to tab, select a tab. The Opera tabs work about the same,
except that you press Ctrl+Alt+N to open a new tab.
Figure 15-4: With Netscape and Mozilla, you can have lots of Web pages
open, one on each tab.
Covering Your Tracks
Almost nobody who uses the Web is proud of each and every
Web page they have visited. In fact, some people want to hide
where they have been and are alarmed when they find out
that Web browsers maintain a history of the pages they have
viewed. The history feature wasn’t added to track your every
move, however. The idea was to make it easy for you to get
back to pages you want to look at again.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
206

If you want to erase your browser’s history file, you can follow
these guidelines:
 Internet Explorer: Choose Tools➪Internet Options. On
the General tab, click the Clear History button.
 Netscape 7 and Mozilla: Choose Edit➪Preferences,
double-click the Navigator category if it’s not open, and
click the History subcategory. Click the Clear History and
Clear Location Bar buttons.
 Opera: Choose File➪Delete Private Data, make sure that
the check boxes in the History section are cleared, and
click OK. (Clear the rest of the check boxes before click-
ing OK, unless you want a bunch of other information
deleted, too.)
There — that was easy! We aren’t about to ask what sites you
have been looking at!
Finding Pages That 
Used to Be There
Rats! A friend e-mails you the address of a Web site that
sounds cool, but when you try the address, your browser dis-
plays a page that says Not Found or 404 Not Found or some
other cheery error message. What gives?
Web pages come and go — nothing about them is permanent.
A page that used to be there may have vanished. But more
likely, your (or your friend) spelled the address wrong. Here
are some things to try:
 Shorten the address: Try chopping things off the end of
the address. Web addresses (also known as URLs, or
Uniform Resource Locators), are in the form http://
hostname/pathname, where hostname is the name of the
computer on which the Web page is stored and pathname
is the exact location of the file. (You don’t have to type
http://, by the way.) The pathname can be a series of
directory or folder names separated by slashes (/), fol-
lowed by a filename. If the filename or the whole path-
name is missing, the Web server displays a default page.
Chapter 15: Ten Internet Annoyances 207

If you are getting an error message, leave off the filename
(if any) of the last directory (folder) on the page. For
example, if this line doesn’t work (we guarantee that it
doesn’t):
http://net.gurus.com/windows/funfacts.html
try this one (still no good):
http://net.gurus.com/windows
and then this one (which works):
http://net.gurus.com
 Google cache: Perhaps the page used to exist, but has
been moved or deleted. The Google Web site maintains a
cache (temporary storage) of every site it indexes, so
Google may still have a copy of the page. Search Google
for text that you’re sure appears on the page you want
and then click the Cached link at the end of the entry for
the site.
 Wayback Machine: The Wayback Machine, at
www.archive.org/web/web.php, is an archive of Web
pages. The page you’re looking for may be stored there; it
has copies of all kinds of Web sites over time. In the top
box, type the Web address of the page you want and click
the Take Me Back button. If the Wayback Machine
archives the site, you see a list of dates on which the site
was saved.
Has This Page Changed?
If a Web page arrives looking as though it has been through a
blender, click the Refresh or Reload button on your browser’s
toolbar or press Ctrl+R. Ditto if you think that the page may
have changed since it was loaded (for example, when you’re
looking at a page with up-to-the-minute news or scores).

Sending Mail to All 
Your Buddies
We don’t want to encourage you to send spam! However, some-
times you need to send a message to a bunch of people, like all
the people on a church committee or all members of your
farflung extended family. People don’t like getting messages
with a hundred e-mail addresses at the top, for two reasons:
 You have to scroll down to see the message.
 You may not want all those other people to see your
address.
Here’s the right way to send a message to a bunch of people
(more than ten or so, or any group of people who don’t know
each other): Type their addresses on the Bcc line, rather than
on the To line, of the message. Bcc, which stands for blind
carbon copy, harkens back to the days when people used
carbon paper to make copies of letters. A blind copy is one
that the rest of the recipients don’t know about.
Not all e-mail programs have obvious Bcc lines when you’re cre-
ating a message, but most have the feature hidden somewhere:
 Outlook Express and Outlook don’t display a Bcc line
(only To and Cc) in the New Message window. Choose
View➪All Headers (in Outlook Express) or View➪Bcc
Field (in Outlook if you don’t use Word to compose mes-
sages) to display it. Or, click the To button (to the left of
the To box) to see the Select Names or Recipients dialog
box, where you can choose people to add to the Bcc line.
 Netscape and Mozilla Mail start with To in the address
section of a new message, but you can click To and
change it to Bcc.
 Eudora, AOL Communicator, Hotmail, and MSN display
a Bcc line without your needing to do a thing!
 AOL doesn’t display a Bcc box in the Write Mail window.
Click the Address Book button, select someone from
your address book, click the Send To button, and choose
Bcc from the menu that appears.
Chapter 15: Ten Internet Annoyances 209

 Pegasus displays the Bcc box on the Special tab when
you’re composing a message; select the tab or press F9.
Rather than leave the To line blank in your message, address
it to yourself. Spam filters tend to throw away messages with
no To address.
