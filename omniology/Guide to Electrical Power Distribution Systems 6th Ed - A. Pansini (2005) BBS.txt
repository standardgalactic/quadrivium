Preface to the
Sixth Edition
This edition continues the practice of updating its contents to re-
flect changes affecting electric distribution systems. It continues its origi-
nal role of providing information in a non or semi technical manner to
persons working on such systems enabling them to perform their duties
in an enlightened way. This contributes not only to a greater quality of
production, but more importantly, with greater safety to themselves and
the general public, the consumers they serve.
While the effects of deregulation have been more pronounced on
the generation and transmission components of the supply chain, it has
also had an impact on the distribution system with its cogeneration and
distributed generation features.
Improvement in materials and methods continue to contribute to
the economic and environmental betterment enjoyed by consumers.
Predominant among these include the gradual replacement of heavier
porcelain insulators with polymer (plastic) ones, the employment of
insulated bucket vehicles making climbing with the use of spikes a lost
art. Improvements in “solid” type insulation in cables, and more effi-
cient machinery for placing them underground. Thus narrowing the
economic differences between overhead and underground installations.
The distribution system is the most visible part of the supply chain,
and as such the most exposed to the critical observation of its users. It
is, in many cases, the largest investment, maintenance and operation
expense, and the object of interest to government, financial agencies, and
“watch dog” associations of concerned citizens. As such, the desirability
of knowing how and why it is so constituted becomes obvious.
Distribution systems have also been affected by deregulation, al-
though not in the same manner as transmission systems, Figure P-1
(opposite). Where additional transmission or generation was not avail-
able or too great an expense to supply some additional loads, Distrib-
uted Generation made its entry on Distribution Systems. Here, small
generating units usually powered by small gas turbines (although other

x
units such as wind powered, solar, fuel cells, etc. may be involved) are
connected to the system as are cogeneration units, both with possible
hazard to safety.
These notes were begun in the early 1940’s as classroom material,
part of a rapid training program for line personnel. The program was
highly successful, reflected in greater safety and production among
other benefits, and achieved national attention.
Once again, our thanks to our old friends, Ken Smalling and The
Fairmont Press for their help and support.

Chapter 1
The Transmission and
Distribution System
INTRODUCTION
Like any other industry, the electric power system may be thought
of as consisting of three main divisions:
1.
manufacture, production or generation, cogeneration,
2.
delivery or transmission and distribution,
3.
consumption.
The discussions in this book will be limited to the subject of electric
distribution.
POWER TRANSMISSION
Figures 1-1 and 1-2 show a typical transmission and distribution
system in both pictorial and block diagram forms. Although geographi-
cal difficulties, demand variances, and other reasons may make for mi-
nor differences in some transmission and distribution systems, the
voltages chosen here are pretty typical. This is what happens to electric-
ity between the generator and a home, office, store, or factory.
There are many definitions of transmission lines, distribution cir-
cuits, and substations specifying distinctions between them. However,
none of these definitions is universally applicable. To give some idea of
where one ends and the other begins: Transmission may be compared to
bulk delivery of a commodity from factory to regional depots;
subtransmission from the depot to central area warehouses; primary
distribution from area warehouse to local wholesale vendors; secondary
distribution from the vendors to local stores; services from store to con-
sumer.

Electrical Power Distribution Systems
In the pictorial rendition, note that the generator produces
20,000 volts. This, however, is raised to 138,000 volts for the long
transmission journey. This power is conducted over 138,000-volt (138
kV) transmission lines to switching stations located in the important
load area served. These steel tower or wood frame lines, which con-
stitute the backbone of the transmission system, span fields and rivers
in direct cross country routes. When the power reaches the switching
stations, it is stepped down to 69,000 volts (69 kV) for transmission in
smaller quantities to the substations in the local load areas. (In some
cases it might be stepped down to 13,800 volts [13.8 kV] for direct
distribution to local areas.) Transmission circuits of such voltages usu-
ally consist of open wires on wood or steel poles and structures in
outlying zones (along highways, for example) where this type of con-
struction is practicable.
Other transmission-line installations can provide an interchange
of power between two or more utility companies to their mutual ad-
vantage. Sometimes, in more densely populated areas, portions of
these transmission lines may consist of high-voltage underground sys-
tems operating at 69,000, 138,000, 220,000, 345,000, 500,000, and
750,000 volts.
WATER-CURRENT ANALOGY
The flow of electric current may be visualized by comparing it with
the flow of water. Where water is made to flow in pipes, electric current
is conducted along wires.
To move a definite amount of water from one point to another in
a given amount of time, either a large-diameter pipe may be used and
a low pressure applied on the water to force it through, or a small-diam-
eter pipe may be used and a high pressure applied to the water to force
it through. While doing this it must be borne in mind that when higher
pressures are used, the pipes must have thicker walls to withstand that
pressure (see Figure 1-3).
The same rule applies to the transmission of electric current. In this
case, the diameter of the pipe corresponds to the diameter of the wire
and the thickness of the pipe walls corresponds to the thickness of the
insulation around the wire, as shown in Figure 1-4.

THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
At the substations, the incoming power is lowered in voltage for
distribution over the local area. Each substation feeds its local load area
by means of primary distribution feeders, some operating at 2400 volts and
others at 4160 volts and 13,800 volts or higher.
Ordinarily, primary feeders are one to five miles in length; in rural
sections where demands for electricity are relatively light and scattered,
they are sometimes as long as 10 or 12 miles. These circuits are usually

carried on poles; but in the more densely built-up sections, underground
conduits convey the cables, or the cable may be buried directly in the
ground.
Distribution transformers connect to the primary distribution lines.
These transformers step down the primary voltage from 2400 volts, 4160
volts, or 13,800 volts, as the case may be, to approximately 120 volts or
240 volts for distribution over secondary mains to the consumer’s ser-
vice (see Figure 1-5).
The lines which carry the energy at utilization voltage from the
transformer to consumer’s services are called secondary distribution
mains and may be found overhead or underground. In the case of trans-
formers supplying large amounts of electrical energy to individual con-
sumers, no secondary mains are required. Such consumers are railroads,
large stores, and factories. The service wires or cables are connected
directly to these transformers. Transformers may also serve a number of
Figure 1-5. Typical distribution system showing component parts.

The Transmission and Distribution System

consumers and secondary mains; they are located in practically every
street in the area served by utility companies.
Services and meters link the distribution system and the
consumer’s wiring. Energy is tapped from the secondary mains at the
nearest location and carried by the service wires to the consumer’s
building. As it passes on to operate the lights, motors, and various ap-
pliances supplied by the house wiring, it is measured by a highly accu-
rate device known as the watt-hour meter. The watt-hour meter
represents the cash register of the utility company (see Figure 1-6).
DETERMINING DISTRIBUTION VOLTAGES
It was pointed out earlier that low voltages require large conduc-
tors, and high voltages require smaller conductors. This was illustrated
with a water analogy. A small amount of pressure may be applied and
the water will flow through a large pipe, or more pressure may be ap-
plied and the water will flow through a slimmer pipe. This principle is
basic in considering the choice of a voltage (or pressure) for a distribu-
tion system.
There are two general ways of transmitting electric current-over-
head and underground. In both cases, the conductor may be copper or

the journey, voltage is helped down from transmission-line level to a
usable level by transformers.

aluminum, but the insulation in the first instance is usually air, except at
the supports (poles or towers) where it may be porcelain or glass. In
underground transmission, the conductor is usually insulated with rub-
ber, paper, oil, plastic, or other material.
In overhead construction, the cost of the copper or aluminum as
compared to the insulation is relatively high. Therefore, it is desirable
when transmitting large amounts of electric power, to resort to the
higher electrical pressures-or voltages, thereby necessitating slimmer,
less expensive conductors. Low voltages necessitate heavy conductors
which are bulky and expensive to install, as well as intrinsically expen-
sive.
However, there is a limit to how high the voltage may be made and
how thin the conductors. In overhead construction there is the problem
of support-poles or towers. If a conductor is made too thin, it will not be
able to support itself mechanically. Then the cost of additional supports
and pole insulators becomes inordinately high. Underground construc-
tion faces the same economic limitation. In this case, the expense is in-
sulation. Underground a cable must be thoroughly insulated and
sheathed from corrosion. The higher the voltage, the more insulation is
necessary, and the bigger the conductor, the more sheathing is necessary
(see Figure 1-7).
Determining distribution voltages is a matter which requires care-
ful studies. Experts work out the system three or four different ways. For
instance, they figure all the expenses involved in a 4000-volt (4 kV), in
a 34,500-volt (34.5 kV), or a 13,000-volt (13 kV) system.
The approximate costs of necessary equipment, insulators,
switches, and so on, and their maintenance and operation must be care-
fully evaluated. The future with its possibilities of increased demand
must also be taken into consideration.
Safety is the most important factor. The National Electric Safety
Code includes many limitations on a utility company’s choice of voltage.
Some municipal areas also set up their own standards.
The utility company must weigh many factors before determining
a voltage for distribution.
It was mentioned that safety is the most important factor in deter-
mining voltages for distributing electricity. Here’s why! Consider what
happens when a water pipe carrying water at high pressure suddenly
bursts (see Figure 1-8). The consequences may be fatal and damage con-
siderable. The same is true of electrical conductors. Safeguarding the life

of the utility company.

Chapter 2
Conductor Supports
SUPPORTS FOR OVERHEAD CONSTRUCTION
Conductors need supports to get from one place to another. Sup-
ports may be towers, poles, or other structures. The latter may be made
of steel, concrete, or wood. The choice of a type of support depends on
the terrain to be crossed and the size of conductors and equipment to be
carried. Availability and economy, as well as atmospheric elements de-
termine the choice of material.
Usually steel poles and towers (Figure 2-1) are used for transmis-
sion lines and wood (Figure 2-2) and concrete poles for distribution cir-
cuits. However, this distinction doesn’t always hold true. To meet the
needs of a particular circumstance, wood or concrete poles can be used
to carry transmission lines; and in some instances a steel tower might be
necessary for a distribution circuit.
In general, steel towers are used where exceptional strength and
reliability are required. Given proper care, a steel tower is good indefi-
nitely.
Steel can also be used for poles. Although they are comparatively
expensive, considerations of strength for large spans, crossing railroads
or rivers, for example, make wood undesirable and steel poles, complete
with steel crossarms are necessary.
In the United States, overhead construction more often consists of
wood poles with the conductor wires attached to insulators supported
on wood crossarms. Although steel and concrete poles are also used,
wood has two desirable advantages: initial economy and natural insulat-
ing qualities.
The choice of wood for poles depends on what is available in the
particular section of the country. For example, in the central United
States, poles of northern white cedar are most apt to be found because
it is easily available in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Because of
the preponderance of western red cedar in Washington, Oregon, and

14

Idaho, poles of this wood are found on the Pacific coast. Besides cedar,
poles are also made of chestnut or yellow pine. The latter type predomi-
nates in the south and east.
TYPES OF POLES
Cedar is one of the most durable woods in this country. It is light,
strong, has a gradual taper and is fairly straight, although full of small
knots. Before pine poles came into prominence, cedar poles were used
where fine appearance in line construction was required. Chestnut is an
extremely strong, durable wood and it is not quite as full of knots as
cedar, however, chestnut tends to be crooked. The popularity of both
cedar and chestnut in past years was largely attributable to their slow
rate of decay, particularly at the ground line. The continuous presence of
moisture and air, and the chemicals in the soil tend to encourage mouldy
growths which consume the soft inner fibers of wood. This is partially
offset by treating the butt (that portion of the pole buried in the ground)
with a preservative. Although no longer installed, many are in use and
will continue to be used for a relatively long time.

Long leaf southern yellow pine is very strong, straight, has a
gradual taper and is usually fairly free of knots. Despite its excellent
appearance, the use of pine in the past was limited by its lack of dura-
bility. However, with improvements in wood-preserving methods, yel-
low pine has come to be widely used. Laminated poles for greater
strength are presently being used, particularly for transmission lines,
although relatively expensive. Wood pole dimensions are given in Table
2-1.
Metal poles, towers, and structures are subject to rust and corro-
sion and, hence, must be maintained (painted, parts renewed) periodi-
cally. Wood poles and structures decay and are affected by birds and
insects, lineworker’s climbers, weather, and so on, all of which tend to
affect their strength and appearance. To combat decay, poles are in-
Figure 2-2. Wood poles. (a) Pine: straight, strong, gradual taper—knot
free—tendency to decay, offset by treating with preservative, which
gives it shiny appearance—prominent east of the Mississippi. (b)
Cedar: straight, strong, durable—many small knots—fine appear-
ance—slow decay—prominent in West. (c) Chestnut: strong, durable,
but crooked-fewer knots—slow decay—formerly prominent east of
the Mississippi.

spected frequently and treated with preservatives.
The question of appearance of such poles and structures is receiv-
ing more and more attention. In addition to “streamlining” such instal-
lations (as will be discussed later), color has been introduced. For
example, wood poles which were formerly brown or black (the “black
beauties,” oozing creosote), may now be found in green, light blue, tan,
or gray colors.
Reinforced concrete poles have become more popular in the United
States in areas where concrete proves more economical. (Design draw-
ings of round and concrete poles are shown in Figures 2-3a and 2-3b and
Tables 2-2a and 2-2b list their dimensions and strengths.) Usually, the
concrete is reinforced with steel, although iron mesh and aluminum can
also be used.
POLE LENGTH
Two factors must be considered in choosing poles: length and
strength required. The length of poles depends on the required clearance
above the surface of the ground, the number of crossarms to be attached,
and other equipment which may be installed (Figure 2-4). Provision
should also be made for future additions of crossarms, transformers, or
other devices. Poles come in standard lengths ranging from 25 to 90 feet
in 5-foot differences; that is, 25 feet, 30 feet, 35 feet, and so on. Special
poles above 90 feet and below 25 feet are also available.
POLE STRENGTH
Required pole strength is determined by the weight of crossarms,
insulators, wires, transformers, and other equipment it must carry, as
well as by ice and wind loadings. All these forces tend to break a pole
at the ground line.
Ice forms about the conductors and other equipment during a
snow or sleet storm (see Figure 2-5). The weight of ice is 57.5 pounds per
cubic foot; thus, if ice about 1 inch thick forms about a conductor 100
feet long, more than 100 pounds will be added to the weight carried by
the poles. While these direct weights may be appreciable, normal wood
poles are more than capable of meeting the ordinary load challenge.

However, the ice formation about the conductors presents quite a
surface to the wind. For example, a 60-mile-per-hour wind, blowing
against the ice-coated wire mentioned, will result in a force of more than
135 pounds per conductor being applied to the top of the pole. If this
pole suspended three conductors, the total force would be nearly 400
pounds.

It also makes a big difference where the conductor is attached on
the pole (see Figure 2-6). A simple illustration of this principle of physics
can be seen in many backyards. If wash is hung on a clothesline attached
to the top of a pliable pole, it is not surprising to see the pole bend. To
keep the pole from bending, the line is attached farther down on the
pole.
The same principle applies to poles which must withstand the
strain of wind and ice-laden conductors. The higher above the ground
the load is applied, the greater will be the tendency for the pole to break
at the ground line.
The forces exerted on a line because of ice and wind will depend
on climatic conditions, which vary in different parts of the country (see
Figure 2-7). In order to safeguard the public welfare, there are published
construction standards called the National Electric Safety Code, which

divides the United States into three loading districts: heavy, medium,
and light.
In the heavy loading district, designs of pole lines are based on
conductors having a layer of ice (0.5) inch thick, that is, presenting a
surface to the wind of the thickness of the conductor plus 1 inch of ice.
Wind pressure is calculated at 4 pounds per square foot (that of a 60-
mile-per-hour wind) and tension on the conductors is calculated at a
temperature of 0°F (–17.8°C). In the medium loading district, these val-
ues are reduced to a quarter (0.25) inch of ice and a temperature of 15°F
Figure 2-4. Height of poles. Height is dependent on: the number of
crossarms, clearance required above ground, and other equipment to
be attached.

24

(–9.4°C). Wind pressure is calculated at the same 4 pounds per square
foot. In the light loading district, no ice is considered, but a wind pres-
sure of 9 pounds per square foot (that of a wind approximately 67-1/2
miles per hour)—and a temperature of 30°F (–2°C) are used for design
purposes.
Note that these standards are minimum. As an extra precaution,
some companies in the heavy and medium districts calculate with a
wind pressure of 8 pounds per square foot and some in the light district
use 12 pounds per square foot.
Another factor which contributes to this bending tendency is the
force applied by the wires at the poles. Normally, equal spans of wires
are suspended from both sides of a pole. However, should the wire span
on one side break, or should there be more wire in the span on one side
than on the other as shown in Figure 2-8, then the uneven pulls will tend
to pull the pole over, again giving the pole a tendency to break at the
ground line. These uneven pulls are counteracted by guys which will be
discussed later.

It can be seen that although poles may be the same length, they
may have different thicknesses at the ground line to give them varying
strengths. However, it is not enough for a pole to be thick enough at the
ground line. If it tapers too rapidly, becoming too thin at the top, then
the pole may break at some other point. Therefore, in rating poles for
strength, a minimum thickness or circumference is specified not only at
the ground line, but also at the top. The strength of a pole is expressed
as its class. For wood, these classes are usually numbered from 1 to 10
inclusive, class 1 being the strongest. Some extra heavy poles may be of

class 0, or 00, or even 000. Dimensions are given in Table 2-1 for wood
poles and in Tables 2-2a and 2-2b for concrete.
To describe a pole completely, it is necessary to tell the type of
material it is made of, its length and its class; for example, 35 feet, class
3, pine pole.
POLE DEPTH
Soil conditions, the height of the pole, weight and pull factors must
be considered in deciding how deep a pole must be planted in the
ground (Figure 2-9). Table 2-3 gives approximate setting depths for poles
in particular given conditions.
For example, suppose a pole 60 feet long is necessary to clear struc-
tures or traffic in the path of the conductors. If there are no extra-strain
conditions-for example, the ground is solid, the terrain is flat, and the
spans are equal-this pole need only be planted 8 feet in the ground.

Electrical Power Distribution Systems
However, if there is an unequal span of wire on one side creating a strain
or if the soil conditions are poor, the pole must be set 8-1/2 feet deep.
POLE GAINS
Gaining is the process of shaving or cutting a pole to receive the
crossarms. In some cases this consists of Cutting a slightly concaved
recess 1/2 inch in depth [see Figure 2-10(a)] so that the arm cannot rock.
The recess in the pole is now considered unnecessary. Instead the
surface of the pole where the crossarm will be attached is merely flat-
tened to present a flat smooth area. This is called “slab gaining,” see
Figure 2-10(b). The cross arm is then fastened to the pole with a through
bolt. Two flat braces are attached to secure the arm. Some poles have two
crossarms mounted one on either side of the pole. These are known as
double arms. When double arms are installed, the pole is gained on one
side only. A double gain would tend to weaken the pole and is unnec-
essary since the tightening of the through-bolt causes the arm on the
back of the pole to bite into the surface.
Pole steps for the lineworker to climb are usually installed at the
same time that the pole is roofed and gained, where these are considered
to be desirable.

CROSSARMS
The woods most commonly used for crossarms are Douglas Fir or
Longleaf Southern Pine because of their straight grain and durability.
The top surface of the arm is rounded [see Figure 2-11 (a)] so that rain
or melting snow and ice will run off easily.
The usual cross-sectional dimensions for distribution crossarms are
3-1/2 inches by 4-1/2 inches; their length depending on the number and
spacing of the pins. Heavier arms of varying lengths are used for special
purposes, usually for holding the heavier transmission conductors and
insulators. Four-pin [see Figure 2-11 (b)], six-pin, and eight-pin arms are
standard for distribution crossarms, the six-pin arm being the most com-
mon. Where unusually heavy loading is encountered, as at corner or
junction poles, double arms, that is, one on each side of the pole may be
required as shown on Figure 2-11 (c). Again, the emphasis on appear-

ance has caused construction designs to eliminate the installation of
crossarms, as will be discussed later.
POLE PINS
Pole pins shown in Figure 2-12 are attached to the crossarms. They
are used to hold pin-type insulators. Note that they are threaded so that
the insulator (discussed in Chapter 3) can be securely screwed on.
Yellow or black locust wood is most commonly used for attaching

the insulators to the crossarms because of its strength and durability;
steel pins are used where greater strength is required.
PIN SPACING
The spacing of the pins (see Figure 2-13) on the crossarms must be
such as to provide enough air space between the conductors to prevent
the electric current from jumping or flashing over from one conductor to
another. Also, sufficient spacing is necessary to prevent contact between
the wires at locations between poles when the wires sway in the wind.
In addition, enough space must be provided to enable workers climbing
through the wires to work safely. The spacing on a standard sixpin arm
is 14-1/2 inches, with 30 inches between the first pins on either side of
Figure 2-12. Pole pins for attaching pin insulators to crossarms.

the pole for climbing space. A special six-pin arm with spacing wider
than 30 inches is frequently used for junction poles to provide greater
safety for the workers.
SECONDARY CABLE
Economy and appearance have dictated the use of wires twisted
into a cable for use as secondary mains and for service connections to
buildings (Figure 2-14). The wires carrying current are generally insu-
lated with a plastic material; the neutral conductor is very often left bare

and may act as the supporting wire for the cable. The twisted combina-
tion, or bundle, is strung from pole to pole as a secondary main, or from
pole to building as a service drop or connection. The bundle may consist
of two wires (duplex), three wires (triplex), or four wires (quadruplex).
This cable became economical and feasible when manufacturers
developed a means of connecting cable to the house service wires with-
out separating the conductors on the pole, as is necessary with second-
ary racks. These connectors save man-hours and pole space. To install
four services, the utility company need only install a bracket, a neutral
connector, and two-phase connectors. With the secondary rack, each ser-
vice required the installation of a clamp, a hook, and three connectors.
SECONDARY RACKS
Secondary mains were often supported in a vertical position. When
so supported, a so-called secondary rack was used in place of the

crossarm (see Figure 2-15). In this type of support, the conductors are
spaced closely and are strung on one side of the pole. As the electrical
pressure or voltage between these conductors is relatively low, usually
120 or 240 volts, it is not necessary to maintain the same spacing as on
crossarms.
The use of this secondary rack simplifies the installation of service
wires to the consumer’s premises. When a number of services run from
each side of the pole, a second rack is installed on the opposite side for
support of the services on that side.

Insulators and Conductors
INSULATORS
Line conductors are electrically insulated from each other as well
as from the pole or tower by nonconductors which are called insulators
(see Figure 3-1).
To determine whether or not an insulator can be used, both its
mechanical strength and electrical properties must be considered. Two
practical insulator materials are porcelain and glass. Both of these leave
much to be desired. Porcelain can withstand heavy loading in compres-
sion, but tears apart easily under tension, that is, when pulled apart. In
using a porcelain insulator, therefore, care must be taken to make the
forces acting on it compress and not pull apart. The same is generally
true of glass.
Although glass insulators are good for lower voltage applications,
porcelain insulators are much more widely used because they are more
practical (see Figure 3-2). Porcelain has two advantages over glass: (1) it
can withstand greater differences in temperature, that is, it will not crack
Figure 3-1. Insulators: (a) post type and (b) pin type.

38
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
when subjected to very high or very low temperatures; (2) porcelain is
not as brittle as glass and will not break as easily in handling or during
installation.
Polymer insulators are not so restricted and have the advantage
also of being lighter in weight than porcelain or glass.
Pin-Type Insulators
Insulators, in compression, supporting conductors may be classi-
fied as pin type and post type.
The pin-type insulator is designed to be mounted on a pin which
in turn is installed on the crossarm of the pole. The insulator is screwed
on the pin and the electrical conductor is mounted on the insulator (Fig-
ure 3-3). Made of porcelain or glass, the pin insulator can weigh any-
where from 1/2 pound to 90 pounds.
This type of insulator is applicable for rural and urban distribution
circuits, and it is usually constructed as one solid piece of porcelain or
glass. In Figure 3-4, note the grooves for the conductor and for the tie
wires.
Larger, stronger pin-type insulators are used for high-voltage
transmission lines. These differ in construction in that they consist of
two or three pieces of porcelain cemented together. These pieces form
what are called petticoats. They are designed to shed rain and sleet
easily.
Post-type insulators are somewhat similar to pin-type insulators.
They are generally used for higher voltage applications with the height
and number of petticoats being greater for the higher voltages. They
may be mounted horizontally as well as vertically, although their
strength is diminished when mounted horizontally. The insulator is

made of one piece of porcelain and its mounting bolt or bracket is an
integral part of the insulator.
Advantage of Pin or Post over Suspension Insulators
The most commonly used insulators are the pin or post type and
the suspension (or hanging) type [see Figure 3-4(c)]. A third type, the
strain insulator, is a variation of the suspension insulator and is de-
signed to sustain extraordinary pulls. Another type, the spool insulator,
is used with secondary racks and on service fittings.
The main advantage of the pin or post-type insulator is that it is
cheaper. Also, the pin or post insulator requires a shorter pole to achieve
the same conductor above the crossarm while the suspension insulator
suspends it below the crossarm.

Figure 3-4 (a). Pin and (b) post-type insulators.

40
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
Figure 3-4 (c) Advantage of pin and post insulators over suspen-
sion insulators. Same conductor height is achieved with shorter pole.
Post-Type Insulators for Armless Construction
Post-type insulators are also used to support conductors of a
polyphase primary circuit (and some transmission lines) without use of
cross arms, as shown in Figure 3-5. This type of installation is employed
where appearance or narrow rights-of-way considerations are impor-
tant.
Overhead Construction Specifications
Refer to Figures 5-25 through 5-31 at the end of Chapter 5 for typi-
cal construction standards of primary line assemblies.
Suspension Insulators
The higher the voltage, the more insulation is needed. Transmis-
sion lines use extremely high voltages, 69,000 to 375,000 volts, for ex-
ample. At these voltages the pin or post-type insulator becomes too
bulky and cumbersome to be practical, and the pin which must hold it
would have to be inordinately long and large. To meet the problem of
insulators for these high voltages, the suspension insulator shown in
Figure 3-6 was developed.
The suspension insulator hangs from the crossarm, as opposed to
the pin insulator which sits on top of it. The line conductor is attached
to its lower end. Because there is no pin problem, any distance can be
put between the suspension insulator and the conductor can be pro-
vided just by adding more insulators to the “string,”
The entire unit of suspension insulators is called a string. How
many insulators this string consists of depends on the voltage, the
weather conditions, the type of transmission construction, and the size
of insulator used. It is important to note that in a string of suspension
insulators one or more insulators can be replaced without replacing the
whole string.
Strain Insulators
Sometimes a line must withstand great strain as shown in Figure
3-7, for instance at a corner, at a sharp curve, or at a dead-end. In such
a circumstance the pull is sustained and insulation is provided by a
strain insulator. On a transmission line, this strain insulator often con-

sists of an assembly of suspension insulators. Because of its peculiarly
important job, a strain insulator must have considerable strength as well
as the necessary electrical properties. Although strain insulators come in
many different sizes, they all share the same principle; that is, they are
constructed so that the cable will compress (and not pull apart) the
porcelain.
Strain insulators are sometimes used in guy cables, where it is
necessary to insulate the lower part of the guy cable from the pole for
the safety of people on the ground. This type usually consists of a por-
celain piece pierced with two holes at right angles to each other through
Figure 3-6. Ball and socket-type suspension insulator.

which the two ends of the guy wires are looped, in such a manner that
the porcelain between them is in compression, Figure 3-8.
Figure 3-8. Strain insulator used for guy wires. Wires of insulator pull
in opposite directions, resulting in compression.
Spool Insulators
The spool-type insulator, which is easily identified by its shape, is
usually used for secondary mains. The spool insulator may be mounted
on a secondary rack or in a service clamp as shown in Figures 3-9(a) and
3-9(b). Both the secondary low-voltage conductors and the house service
wires are attached to the spool insulator. The use of such insulators has
decreased greatly since the introduction of cabled secondary and service
wires.
The tapered hole of the spool insulator distributes the load more
evenly and minimizes the possibility of breakage when heavily loaded.
The “clevis” which is usually inserted in this hole is a piece of steel
metal with a pin or bolt passing through the bottom.
POLYMER (PLASTIC) INSULATION
In general, any form of porcelain insulation may be replaced with
polymer. Their electrical characteristics are about the same. Mechani-
cally they are also about the same, except porcelain must be used under
compression while polymer may be used both in tension and compres-
sion. Porcelain presently has an advantage in shedding rain, snow and
ice and in its cleansing effects; polymer may allow dirt, salt and other
pollutants to linger on its surface encouraging flashover, something that
can be overcome by adding additional polymer surfaces. Polymer’s
greatest advantage, however, is its comparatively light weight making
for labor savings; and essentially no breakage in handling. For detailed
comparison of the two insulations, refer to Appendix A, Insulation:
Porcelain vs. Polymer.

CONDUCTORS
Line Conductors
Line conductors may vary in size according to the rated voltage.
The number of conductors strung on a pole depends on the type of cir-
cuits that are used.
Because they strike a happy combination of conductivity and
economy, copper, aluminum, and steel are the most commonly used
conductor materials. Silver is a better conductor than copper; but its
mechanical weakness and high cost eliminate it as a practical conductor
(see Figure 3-10).
On the other hand, there are cheaper metals than copper and alu-
minum; but they would be hopelessly poor conductors. Copper is the
touchstone of conductors. Other conducting materials are compared to
Figure 3-9. Spool insulator (a)

on a secondary rack.

Insulators and Conductors
45
copper to determine their economic value as electrical conductors.
Aluminum-steel or copper-steel combinations and aluminum have
become popular for conductors in particular circumstances. Aluminum
alloys are also used as conductors.
Copper Conductors
Copper is used in three forms: hard drawn, medium-hard drawn,
and soft drawn (annealed). Hard-drawn copper wire has the greatest
strength of the three and is, therefore, mainly used for transmission cir-
cuits of long spans (200 ft or more). However, its springiness and inflex-
ibility make it hard to work with [see Figure 3-11 (a)].
Soft-drawn wire is the weakest of the three [Figure 3-11 (b)]. Its use
is limited to short spans and for tying conductors to pin-type insulators.
Since it bends easily and is easy to work with, soft-drawn wire is used
widely for services to buildings and some distribution circuits. Practice,
however, has been toward longer distribution circuit spans and use of
medium-hard-drawn copper wire.
Figure 3-10. All conductors are compared to copper. (a) Steel, strong,
but poor conductor. (b) Copper, an all-around good, durable conductor
for its price. (c) Aluminum, light, durable, rust-proof, but only 70% as
good a conductor. (d) Silver, better conductor, too expensive, and
mechanically weak.

46
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
Aluminum and ACSR Conductors
Aluminum is used because of its light weight as illustrated in Fig-
ure 3-12, which is less than one third that of copper. It is only 60 to 80
percent as good a conductor as copper and only half as strong as copper.
For these reasons it is hardly ever used alone, except for short distribu-
tion spans. Usually the aluminum wires are stranded on a core of steel
wire. Such steel reinforced aluminum wire has great strength for the
weight of the conductor and is especially suitable for long spans. Trans-
mission lines often consist of aluminum conductors steel reinforced
(ACSR).
Steel Conductors
Steel wire is rarely used alone. However, where very cheap con-
struction is needed, steel offers an economic advantage. Because steel
wire is three to five times as strong as copper, it permits longer spans
and requires fewer supports. However, steel is only about one tenth as
good a conductor as copper and it rusts rapidly [see Figure 3-13(a)]. This
rusting tendency can be counteracted (so that steel wire will last longer)
by galvanizing, that is, by the application of a coat of zinc to the surface.
Copperweld or Alumoweld Conductors
The main disadvantages of steel are a lack of durability and con-
Figure 3-11 (a). Hard-drawn copper is strong but inflexible and
springy. It is used for long spans. (b) Soft-drawn (annealed) copper is
weak but easy to handle. It is used for service and some distribution
circuits.

47
ductivity. On the other hand, steel is cheap, strong, and available. These
advantages made the development of copper-clad or aluminum-clad
steel wire [see Figure 3-13(b)] most attractive to the utility companies. To
give steel wire the conductivity and durability it needs, a coating of
copper is securely applied to its outside. The conductivity of this clad
steel wire can be increased by increasing the coating of copper or alumi-
num. This type of wire, known as Copperweld or Alumoweld is used for
guying purposes and as a conductor on rural lines, where lines are long
and currents are small.
Conductor Stranding
As conductors become larger, they become too rigid for easy han-
dling. Bending can damage a large solid conductor. For these practical
reasons, the stranded conductor was developed (see Figure 3-14). A
stranded conductor consists of a group of wires twisted into a single
Figure 3-12. The advantage of aluminum as a conductor is its light
weight-less than one third the weight of copper.

48
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
conductor. The more wires in the conductor’s cross section, the greater
will be its flexibility. Usually, all the strands are of the same size and
same material (copper, aluminum, or steel). However, manufacturers do
offer stranded conductors combining these metals in different quantities.
Sometimes 3 strands of wire are twisted together. But usually, they
are grouped concentrically around 1 central strand in groups of 6. For
example, a 7-strand conductor consists of 6 strands twisted around 1
central wire. Then 12 strands are laid over those 6 and twisted to make
a 19-strand conductor.
To make a 37-strand conductor, 18 more are placed in the gaps
between these 18. And so the number of strands increases to 61, 91, 127,
and so on.
Other combinations are possible. For example, 9 strands can be
twisted around a 3-strand twist to make a 12-strand wire. Two large
strands can be twisted slightly and then surrounded by 12 twisted
strands making a 14-strand conductor.

Conductor Coverings
Conductors on overhead lines may be either bare or covered. Such
conductors, located in trees, or adjacent to structures where they may
come into occasional contact, may be covered with high density polyeth-
ylene or other plastic material resistant to abrasion. This covering is
generally not sufficient to withstand the rated voltage at which the line
is operating; so these conductors must be mounted on insulators any-
way. The purpose of the covering is mainly to protect the wire from
mechanical damage. The wires should be treated as though they were
bare.
Whether or not the lines are covered, workers consider it necessary
for safety to work with rubber. Besides wearing rubber gloves (see Fig-
ure 3-15) and sleeves, they make sure to cover the conductors, insulators,
and other apparatus with line hose, hoods, blankets, and shields.
Developments now allow workers to work on conductors while
energized, as long as the platform or bucket in which they are standing
is insulated. In this “bare hand” method, they usually wear
noninsulating leather work gloves. Extreme caution is necessary in this
method, as the insulated platform or bucket insulates workers from a
live conductor and ground, but does not protect them when working on
two or more live conductors between which high voltage may exist.
Transmission lines, operating at higher voltages, may be worked

on when energized or de-energized. They are generally situated in open
areas where the danger to the public from fallen wires is negligible. Also,
because the amount of insulation required would make the conductor
bulky and awkward to install, it is desirable to leave high-voltage trans-
mission line conductors bare.
Wire Sizes
In the United States, it is common practice to indicate wire sizes by
gage numbers. The source of these numbers for electrical wire is the
American Wire Gage (AWG) (otherwise known as the Brown & Sharpe
Gage). A small wire is designated by a large number and a large wire by
a small number as shown in Figure 3-16. The diameter of a No. 0000
wire is 0.4600 inch or 460 mils; the diameter of a No. 36 wire is 0.0050
inch or 5 mils. There are 38 other sizes between these two extremes. For
example, a No. 8 wire is 0. 1285 inch (128.5 mils) in diameter and a No.
1 wire is 0.2576 (257.6 mils) in diameter.
It has proved convenient to discuss the cross-section area of a wire
in circular mils. A circular mil (cm) is the area of a circle having a diam-
eter of 0.001 inch or 1 mil. Because it is a circular area unit of measure,
it is necessary only to square the number of mils given in the diameter
of a wire to find the number of circular mils in a circle of that diameter.
Figure 3-15. Lineworker working on line conductor.

Insulators and Conductors
51
Thus, a conductor with a 1-mil diameter would have a 1-circular-mil
(cm) cross-section area; a 3-mil diameter wire would have a 9-cm area;
and a 40-mil-diameter wire, a 1600-cm area.
For conductors larger than 0000 (4/0) in size, the wire sizes are
expressed in circular mils; for example, 350,000 cm, 500,000 cm, and so
on. (Sometimes these are expressed as 350 mcm, 500 mcm, etc.)
Characteristics of copper and aluminum wires are listed in Table 3-1.
Tie Wires
Conductors must be held firmly in place on the insulators to keep
them from falling or slipping. On pin insulators, they are usually tied to
the top or side groove of the insulator by means of a piece of wire, called
a tie-wire. On suspension type insulators, conductors are usually held in
place by a clamp or “shoe,” as shown in Figure 3-17(a).
Where conductors must be maintained while energized, and can-
not be touched by hands, they are handled on the ends of sticks called
“hot sticks.” When it is necessary to use these hot sticks, the ends of the
tie wires are looped so that they can be easily wrapped or unwrapped

Another type clamp as shown in Figure 3-17(c) is the clamp top

Connectors
Conductors are sometimes spliced by overlapping the ends and
twisting the ends together, taking three or four turns. But to insure a
good electrical connection as well as uniformity in workmanship, it is

wise to connect conductors with mechanical connectors. (Different such
connectors are shown in Figure 3-18.) They are often substantial money-
savers.
One type inserts the two ends into a double sleeve. When the two
conductors are parallel and adjacent to each other, the sleeve is then
twisted. With the compression sleeve the conductors are inserted from
both ends until they butt and the sleeve is then crimped in several
places. The “automatic” splice has the conductor ends inserted in each
end where they are gripped by wedges held together by a spring. The
split-bolt or “bug nut” connector is a copper or tin-plated-copper bolt
with a channel cut into the shank; both conductors fit into the channel
and are compressed together by a nut.
Another type of connector used where it is required to connect or
disconnect primary conductors while energized is the “hot-line” clamp
shown in Figure 3-19(a). In order to protect the conductors themselves
from mechanical injury, especially from possible sparking, the clamp is
often applied to a “saddle” installed on the conductor, as shown in Fig-
ure 3-19(b).

Chapter 4
Line Equipment
Besides conductors and insulators, many other pieces of equip-
ment are necessary to get electric power from the generator to a con-
sumer. Figure 4-1 identifies each of these pieces of equipment. Their
functions will be covered in this chapter.
DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMERS
The distribution transformer shown in Figure 4-2 is certainly the
most important of these pieces of equipment. Without the distribution
transformer, it would be impossible to distribute power over such long
distances. Earlier in this book, we explained that the purpose of a trans-
former is to step up or step down voltage. In the case of the distribution
transformer, the voltage is stepped down from that of the primary mains
of a distribution circuit to that of the secondary mains. In most cases,
this is from 2400, 4160, or 13,800 volts to 120 or 240 volts.
Most distribution transformers consist of (1) a closed-loop mag-
netic core on which are wound two or more separate copper coils, (2) a
tank in which the corecoil assembly is immersed in cooling and insulat-
ing oil, (3) bushings for bringing the incoming and outgoing leads
through the tank or cover.
Bushings
On every distribution transformer, attachments are to be found
which are normally referred to as primary bushings and secondary
bushings (see Figure 4-3).
A bushing is an insulating lining for the hole in the transformer
tank through which the conductor must pass. Primary bushings are al-
ways much larger because the voltage is higher at that point. Sometimes
the primary and secondary bushings are called high-voltage and low-
voltage bushings.

58
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
Bushings may protrude either from the sidewall of the transformer
tank or from its covers. There are three types of bushings; the solid porce-
lain bushing, the oil-filled bushing, and the capacitor type bushing.
Solid porcelain bushings are used for voltages up to 15 kV. A solid
conductor runs through the center of the porcelain form. The conductor
is insulated copper cable or solid conductor terminating in a cap. The
bushing cap has mountings that permit the line cables to be connected
to the transformer winding. The mounting must be so designed that the
cable of the transformer lead can be detached to allow the bushing to be
removed for replacement.
For higher voltage transformers (discussed in the substations sec-
tion), bushings are oil-filled to improve their insulating characteristics

within their specified dimensions. The interior portions of the capacitor
bushing are wound with high-grade paper. The oil is replaced with
paper and thin layers of metal foil to improve the distribution of stresses
because of the high voltage. All three types of bushing have an outer
shell of porcelain to contain the insulation inside and to shed rain.
The Tap Changer
It is often necessary to vary the voltage in a transformer winding
(primary) to allow for a varying voltage drop in the feeder (transmis-
sion) lines. In other words, in spite of a varying input, the output must
be nearly constant. Several ways can be used to obtain the desired result.
One method used to adjust the winding ratio of the transformer
uses the no-load tap changer shown in Figure 4-4. A transformer
equipped with a no-load tap changer must always be disconnected from
the circuit before the ratio adjustment can be made. The selector switch
is operated under oil usually placed within the transformer itself; but it
is not designed to be used as a circuit breaker. To change taps on small
distribution transformers, the cover must be removed and an operating
handle is used to make the tap change. For the larger type, one handle
may be brought through the cover and the tap may be changed with a
wheel or even a motor.
Figure 4-4. Tap changer used to adjust the turns ratio of a transformer.
(a) No-load tap change and (b) typical internal wiring of transformer
with tap changer.

Line Equipment
61
If it is necessary to change the taps when the transformer cannot be
disconnected from the circuit, tap changers under-load are used. They
involve the use of an autotransformer and an elaborate switching ar-
rangement. The information regarding the switching sequence must be
furnished with each transformer. Tap changers can function automati-
cally if designed with additional control circuits: automatic tap changes
are used for high-power transformers, and for voltage regulators.
Mounting Distribution Transformers
Distribution transformers are almost always located outdoors
where they are hung from crossarms, mounted on poles directly (see
Figure 4-5) or placed on platforms. In general, transformers up to 75 kVA
size are mounted directly to the pole or on a crossarm and larger size
transformers (or groups of several transformers) are placed on platforms
or mounted on poles in banks or clusters.
How a transformer is mounted is a matter of considerable impor-
tance. Remember that the distribution transformer must stay put and
continue functioning even in the midst of violent winds, pouring rain,
freezing cold, sleet, and snow. Besides weather, there is danger of the
pole itself being hit by a carelessly driven vehicle.
Modern pole-mounted transformers [see Figure 4-6(a)] have two
lugs welded directly on the case. These lugs engage two bolts on the
pole as shown in Figure 46(b) from which the whole apparatus hangs
securely. This method, which is known as direct mounting eliminates the
need for crossarms and hanger irons (as was done in the past), thus
saving a considerable amount of material and labor.
In the past, transformers were hung from crossarms by means of
hanger irons, which were two flat pieces of steel with their top ends bent
into hooks with squared sides (see Figure 4-7). The transformer was
bolted to these pieces of steel, the assembly was raised slightly above the
crossarm and then lowered so that the hooks on the hanger irons would
engage the crossarm. Many such installations still exist.
A transformer should not be mounted on a junction pole (a pole
supporting lines from three or more directions) as this makes working
on such a pole more hazardous for the worker.
Where transformers cannot be mounted on poles because of size or
number, they may be installed on an elevated platform [Figure 4-8(a)] or
a ground-level pad [Figure 4-8(b)]. Platforms are built in any shape or
size required to suit the particular need. They are usually constructed of

62
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
wood, though steel is often used for some of the members. Ground-level
pads are usually made of concrete or reinforced concrete and are very
useful when appearance is a major consideration.
A Conventional Distribution Transformer
Manufacturers produce two types of distribution transformers: the
conventional and the completely self-protected. (CSP is the
Westinghouse trade designation for this latter type. Other manufacturers

pole.

simply call them self-protected transformers.) A conventional distribu-
tion transformer consists only of a case containing the transformer unit
with protective devices, usually a primary fuse cutout and a lightning
arrester, mounted separately on the pole or crossarm (see Figure 4-9).
CSP Distribution Transformers
In the CSP transformer, a weak link or primary protective fuse link
shown in Figure 4-10 is mounted inside the tank with the transformer
unit as also are two circuit breakers for protection on the secondary side
of the transformer. A simple thermal device causes the breakers to open
when a predetermined safe value of temperature is exceeded. The light-

distribution transformers.

ning arrester is mounted on the outside of the tank. It is apparent that
the CSP transformer makes for simpler, more economic mounting and
neater appearance. What’s more, it is of particular advantage for higher
voltage (13.8 kV) primary distribution systems where connections and
disconnections are made with hot sticks.

ers on poles. (a) T-shaped hanger iron using two crossarms. (b) C-

smaller transformers, a T-shaped hanger-iron one crossarm and a

FUSE CUTOUTS
Suppose a circuit is designed to carry 100 A. Should the amperage
climb over that limit, it could eventually melt some of the wires and
cause widespread interruption of service. To prevent this, a weak spot is
intentionally designed into a circuit—a place where overload will regis-
ter and open the circuit almost immediately. This spot is called a fuse. A
fuse consists of a short piece of metal having low melting characteristics
which will melt at a rated temperature.
It is amperage flowing through a conductor that sometimes makes
the conductor hot to touch. This is what the fuse counts on. Should there
be an overload, the fuse melts, thus disconnecting the circuit.
Fuse cutouts go one step further. They may be placed as shown in
Figure 4-11 so as to cut out the section of the circuit that is endangered,
allowing the rest of the circuit to remain energized.
A primary fuse cutout is connected between the primary lines and
Figure 4-8. Mounting of distribution transformers. (a) Platform
mounted and (b) pad mounted.

the transformer shown in Figure 4-12 to protect the transformer from
overloads and to disconnect the transformer from the primary lines in
case of trouble. A primary line fuse cutout can disconnect any portions
of a primary circuit supplying several distribution transformers, in case
of overload or fault, leaving the rest of the circuit energized.
Although there are several types of fuse cutouts, the principle
upon which each is constructed is the same. A fuse ribbon makes a
connection between two contacts, either the line and the transformer or
the main line and that portion to be protected.
The Door-type Cutout
In the door or box-type cutout shown in Figure 4-13, the fuse is
mounted inside the door in such a manner that when the door closes,
the fuse engages two contacts, one on the top of the box and the other
Figure 4-9. A conventional transformer requires separate mounting of
lightning arresters and fuse cutouts.

on the bottom. To open this cutout, the door is pulled open and allowed
to hang downward from the box. The fusible element is enclosed in a
fiber tube; when the fuse blows or melts because of excessive current
passing through it, the resultant arc attacks the fiber tube, producing a
gas which blows out the arc. For this reason this type cutout is some-
times also called the expulsion type. In later models, the fuse mounting
is arranged so that the melting of the fusible element causes the door to
drop open, signaling to the worker on the ground that the fuse has
blown. The use of this type cutout is generally limited to circuits oper-
ating at voltages under 5000 volts.
The Open-type Cutout
The open-type cutout (Figure 4-14) is essentially the same as the
door type, except that the fiber tube enclosing the fusible element is
exposed in the open, rather than enclosed in a porcelain box. This ar-
rangement enables larger currents to be interrupted without confining as
much the attendant violent expulsion of gases (which can destroy the
cutout). The tube drops when the fuse blows, indicating that the fuse has
blown. This type cutout is used on distribution circuits operating at
voltages over 5000 volts, although it can be used on lower voltage cir-
cuits.
The Repeater Fuse
When line fuses are used to protect a portion of a primary circuit
as previously described, a repeater fuse may be used. The repeater fuse
shown in Figure 4-15 is usually of the open type and consists of two or
three fuses mechanically arranged so that when the first fuse blows and
drops, the action places the second fuse automatically in the circuit. If
the trouble has been cleared, service will be restored. Should the second
fuse also blow, a third is also automatically connected in the circuit;
when the third fuse blows, the portion of the circuit is finally de-ener-
gized. Repeater fuses hold down to a minimum interruptions in service
caused by temporary faults. These faults may arise from wires swinging
together when improperly sagged, or from tree branches or animals
making momentary contact with the line, or from lightning surges caus-
ing temporary flashover at an insulator.
All of these fused cutouts are mounted on the crossarm or on the
pole by bolts and a steel bracket.

70
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
LIGHTNING OR SURGE ARRESTERS
A lightning arrester is a device that protects transformers and other
electrical apparatus from voltage surges. These surges can occur either
because of lightning or improper switching in the circuit. The lightning
arrester provides a path over which the surge can pass to ground as
shown in Figure 4-16(a), before it has a chance to attack and seriously
damage [see Figure 4-16(b)] the transformer or other equipment.
The elementary lightning arrester consists of an air gap (illustrated
in Figure 4-17) in series with a resistive element. The voltage surge
causes a spark which jumps across the air gap, passes through the resis-
tive element (silicon carbide, for example) which is usually a material
Figure 4-14. Open-type fuse cutout.

Line Equipment
71
that allows a low-resistance path for the high-voltage surge, but presents
a high resistance to the flow of line energy. This material is usually
known as the “valve” element. There are many different types of light-
ning arresters, but they generally have this one principle in common.
There is usually an air gap in series with a resistive element, and what-
ever the resistive (or valve) element is made of, it must act as a conduc-
tor for high-energy surges and also as an insulator toward the line
energy. In other words, the lightning arrester leads off only the surge
energy. Afterwards, there is no chance of the normal line energy being
led into ground.
Valve Arresters
Since all arresters have a series gap and a resistive element, they
differ only in mechanical construction and in the type of resistive ele-
ment used. One type arrester consists of a porcelain cylinder filled with
some suitable material with electrodes at either end (see Figure 4-18).
The series gap assembly is usually at the top. When there is excessive
voltage surge on the line, the spark jumps across the air gap and the
surge energy flows through the material to the ground. As the surge

72
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
decreases, the resistive power of the material increases so that no line
energy will flow to the ground.
Expulsion-type Arresters
In this type arrester there are two series gaps (shown in Figure 4-
19)—one external and one internal—which are to be bridged by the high
voltage surge. The second gap formed between two internal electrodes
is actually inside a fiber tube which serves to quench the line energy

ment. (a) With arrester, surge voltage is drained to ground. (b) With no
arrester, surge voltage causes damage.

when it comes through. (Thus, the valve element in this case is the fiber
tube itself.) When lightning occurs, the gaps are bridged and the high
energy flows harmlessly to ground. However, when the line energy tries
to go through the arcing channel, the fiber tube creates nonconducting
gases which in turn blow the arc and conducting gases out the vent, thus
reestablishing a wall of resistance to the line energy.
VOLTAGE REGULATORS
At this point, voltage regulators for pole-mounting will be dis-
cussed. Later, when substations are discussed, these will be used there
as well.
A voltage regulator is generally used to maintain the voltage of a
line. The primary feeder voltage generally drops when a large load
current is drawn and less voltage is available across the primaries of the
Figure 4-17. Elementary lightning arrester.

74
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
distribution transforms. The regulator maintains the voltage at the
proper rated value at all times.
The principle of operation of a voltage regulator is somewhat simi-
lar to that of a transformer having taps, as previously described. This
form of regulator has two fixed windings, a primary (high-voltage)
winding connecting in shunt or across a line, and a secondary or low-
voltage winding connected in series with the line. The secondary or
series winding is provided with as many taps as necessary (shown in
Figure 4-20) to vary the voltage across this winding. This equipment
operates as a voltage regulator by means of a control circuit which au-
tomatically changes the tap setting on the series winding, while leaving
the voltage applied to the primary (high-voltage) winding alone. The
variable voltage in the series winding can thus be added or subtracted
Figure 4-18. Valve lightning arrester.

75
from the incoming (or primary) voltage, resulting in an outgoing voltage
which can be kept approximately constant even when the incoming
primary voltage may vary.
Another type, known as the induction-type voltage regulator, ac-
complishes the same effect by having the primary coil rotate, changing
its position in relation to the secondary coil, which in this case has no
taps. (Figure 4-21)
Voltage regulators are either hand or motor-operated. When a
motor is used, it is usually automatically controlled by means of relays.

77
CAPACITORS
Should the voltage on a circuit fall below a specified level for some
reason, a device called a capacitor can momentarily maintain the voltage
at line value. Basically, a capacitor serves the same purpose as a storage
tank in a water system. By maintaining the water in a storage tank at a
definite level, the pressure on the water supplied by the system con-
nected to it is maintained evenly.
It is the job of capacitors to keep the power factor as close to 1 as
possible. The power factor is an important essential of electricity which
will be explained later. At this point, let it suffice to say that keeping the
power factor close to 1 is a considerable economic advantage to the
utility company and to the consumer. Inductance is the element in the
circuit which is pulling the power factor below 1. Capacitance is the
enemy of inductance. Therefore, capacitors counteract inductance, keep
the power factor close to 1, and save money for the utility company.
The capacitor usually consists of two conductors separated by an
insulating substance. Among other materials which may be used, a ca-
pacitor can be made of aluminum foil separated by oil-impregnated
paper (see Figure 4-22), or synthetic insulating materials.
Capacitance is the property of a capacitor. Capacitance depends on
the area of the conductors, on the distance between the conductors and
on the type of insulating material used.
Introducing capacitors into a circuit causes the current to lead the
voltage in phase. Introducing inductance (or an inductor) into a circuit
causes the current to lag the voltage in phase. In most power applica-
tions, inductance prevails and reduces the amount of pay-load power
produced by the utility company for a given size of generating equip-
ment. The capacitor counteracts this loss of power and makes power-
production more economical.
Capacitors are mounted on crossarms or platforms (see Figure 4-
23) and are protected with lightning arresters and cutouts, the same as
transformers. Figure 4-24 illustrates the many uses that are made of
capacitors.
SWITCHES
Switches shown in Figure 4-25 are used to interrupt the continuity
of a circuit. They fall into two broad classifications: air switches and oil

vacuum or gas (SF6) switches. As their names imply, air switches are
those whose contacts are opened in air, while the other type switches are
those whose contacts are opened in oil, vacuum, or gas. Oil switches are
usually necessary only in very high-voltage, high-current circuits.
Air switches are further classified as air-break switches and discon-
nect switches.
Air-break Switches
The air-break switch shown in Figure 4-26 has both the blade and
the contact equipped with arcing horns. These are pieces of metal be-
tween which the arc resulting from opening a circuit carrying current is
allowed to form. As the switch opens, these horns are spread farther and
farther apart and the are is lengthened until it finally breaks.
Air-break switches are of many designs. Some are operated from
the ground by a hook on the end of a long insulated stick; some others
through a system of linkages are opened by a crank at the foot of the

pole. Where more than one conductor is opened, there may be several
switches mounted on the same pole. These may be opened singly or
altogether in a “gang” as this system is called. Some switches are
mounted so that the blade opens downward and these may be provided
with latches to keep the knife blade from jarring open.
A modern development of the air-break switch is the load-break
switch shown in Figure 4-27 which breaks the arc inside a fiber tube. As
in the expulsion lightning arrester, the fiber tube produces a gas which
helps to confine the arc and blow it out. There is a possibility that the
unconfined are associated with the horn-type switch might communi-
cate itself to adjacent conductors or structures causing damage and
possible injury. But the load-break switch eliminates this potential haz-
ard.
The important element of the load-break switch is the interrupter
unit shown in Figure 4-27. Naturally, the heart of the unit is the arc-
extinguishing section which consists of a pair of arcing contacts (one
stationary and one movable) and a trailer operating within a fiber bore.
Figure 4-23. Pole-mounted capacitors. (a) Primary and (b) secondary.

Electrical Power Distribution Systems
Figure 4-24. How capacitors are used.

Line Equipment
81
The trailer which is made of acrylic resin, follows the contact through
the bore, confining the arc between the fiber wall and itself. The arc is
extinguished by deionizing gases coming from both the fiber and the
acrylic resin.
The disconnect switch (Figure 4-28) is not equipped with arc-
quenching devices and, therefore, should not be used to open circuits
carrying current. This disconnect switch isolates one portion of the cir-
cuit from another and is not intended to be opened while current is
flowing. Air-break switches may be opened under load, but disconnect
switches must not be opened until the circuit is interrupted by some
other means (see Figure 4-29).
Oil Switches
The oil switch has both the blade and the contact mounted in a
tank filled with oil. The switch is usually operated from a handle on the
Figure 4-25. Switches interrupt the continuity of a circuit. (a) Typical
switch, (b) air switch, and (c) oil switches.

outside of the case. As the switch opens, the arc formed between the
blade and contact is quenched by the oil.
Oil switches may be remote controlled (see Figure 4-30) as well as
manually operated. They are used for capacitor switching, street lighting
control and automatic disconnect in case of power failure.
RECLOSERS
Oil-circuit Reclosers
A recloser consists essentially of an oil switch or breaker actuated
by relays which cause it to open when predetermined current-values

and pole-mounted air-break switch in open position (b).

flow through it. The recloser resembles the repeater fuse cutout de-
scribed previously In many ways. Reclosers are usually connected to
protect portions of primary circuits and may take the place of line fuses.
The switch or breaker is arranged to reclose after a short interval of time
and re-open again should the fault or overload which caused the excess
current-flow persist. Also, the same as the repeater fuse cutout, the
recloser can be set for three or four operations before it locks itself open
for manual operation. It differs from the repeater fuse cutout in that its

rupter unit (b).

action is repetitive. In a recloser, there is an operating rod actuated by a
solenoid plunger which opens and closes the contacts, whereas the re-
peater fuse works only when the metal has been melted by overheat.
Figure 4-31 shows a typical single-phase oil-circuit recloser.
However, should it be desirable to delay the action of the recloser,
it can be done by an ingenious timing device. Figure 4-32 illustrates an
oscillogram showing a typical example of a recloser operation. Notice
that the first time it opens and closes, the action is instantaneous requir-
ing only 1.6 cycles. The second time the action is delayed to 2 cycles, the
third time to 6, and the fourth time to 5-1/2 cycles. Then the recloser
locks itself open and a worker must correct the fault and manually close
the mechanism.

Automated Operation
All of the materials and equipment, assembled properly, make up
the primary circuits that serve a particular area. The operation of the cir-
cuits include such things as the switching of circuits or portions of circuits
(termed sectionalizing) for transferring loads or emergency restoration of
service, for controlling voltage regulators, for switching capacitors and
other manipulations of lines and equipment-operations usually per-
formed manually under centralized control. Where circumstances gener-
ally involving the importance of service continuity, and where justified
economically permit, these operations may be accomplished automati-
cally. The relays that actuate these operations may be controlled by
preprogrammed computers that impart “instructions” via radio, by tele-
phone lines, or by independent circuits established for that purpose.

control. (a) Cutaway view showing switch in open position. (b) Tank

POLYMER (PLASTIC) INSULATION
In general, any form of porcelain insulation may be replaced with
polymer. Their electrical characteristics are about the same. Mechani-
cally they are also about the same, except porcelain must be used under
compression while polymer may be used both in tension and compres-
sion. Porcelain presently has an advantage in shedding rain, snow and
ice and in its cleansing effects; polymer may allow dirt, salt and other
pollutants to linger on its surface encouraging flashover, something that
can be overcome by adding additional polymer surfaces. Polymer’s
greatest advantage, however, is its comparatively light weight making
for labor savings; and essentially no breakage in handling. For detailed
comparison of the two insulations, refer to Appendix A, Insulation:
Porcelain vs. Polymer.

Chapter 5
Overhead Construction
OBSTACLES TO OVERHEAD CONSTRUCTION
We have covered some of the basic elements of overhead construc-
tion-conductors, insulators, the supports which carry them, transform-
ers, lightning arresters, switches, and fuses. Now consider some of the
obstacles that the utility company must overcome when constructing its
overhead lines. Trees, pedestrians, railroads, rivers, weather, and hills all
present problems which must be overcome. Some of these obstacles are
illustrated in Figure 5-1.
CLEARANCES
In constructing overhead distribution lines, the utility company
must consider the terrain as well as man-made obstacles such as rail-
roads (see Figure 5-2). For reasons of safety, the voltage of the wires to
be strung must be considered. The higher the voltage, the farther away
it must be strung from people, traffic, and other wires.
The National Electric Safety Code has set forth specifications gov-
erning these clearances. These specifications usually pertain to “class”
voltage values. Table 5-1 uses these class values rather than actual volt-
ages in use.
Suppose a 15-kV-distribution line must cross a railroad. According
to the specifications given, it must be 30 feet above the ground. In other
words, its minimum clearance is 30 feet. But then, a few blocks away, it
need only cross a well-traveled street. Here the minimum clearance
drops to 22 feet.
Sometimes, wires must cross other wires. Here the voltages of both
must be considered to make certain that there is no overstrain on the
insulation and no flashover. For instance, if a 750-V wire must cross
another 750-V wire, there need only be 2 feet between (see Figure 5-3).

8.7 kV, requirements call for 6,-1' feet between conductors must be al-

Tree Wires
Trees are a frequently encountered obstacle to distribution over-
head wiring. Should a tree come in contact with a primary line, it could
act as a ground and short the whole circuit. The abrasion of tree
branches can often damage the conductor insulation.
Where possible, trees are trimmed. Figure 5-4 shows proper way to
trim a tree. Permission for trimming must always be obtained either

92
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
from the owner or from local or state authorities. But permission is not
always granted; so a tree wire is necessary.
This wire has a tough, outer covering which can withstand consid-
erable abrasion. Figure 5-5 shows a plastic-covered wire which is often
used for this purpose. This wire provides partial insulation as well as a
tough covering for wires operating at higher voltage values. There are
also other types of tree wire.
Plastic coverings have come to be widely used in the power utility
industry because they are highly resistant to the action of moisture,
minerals, oils, and numerous organic solvents. It must be remembered
that such coverings are not to be considered as sufficient insulation for
the voltage at which the conductor is operating. The conductor must be
handled as if it were bare. Refer to conductors described in Chapter 3.
SAG
Notice how a conductor is strung between poles. It is not pulled
tight; it sags. In hot weather it sags even more than in cold weather.
Consider the analogy of the clothesline. A tightly strung clothesline

as shown in Figure 5-6(a) puts a much greater strain on the poles which
hold it at either end. Adding the weight of wet clothes to a tightly strung
line might even pull the poles out of place. However, using a little more
rope and allowing the clothesline to dip a little [see Figure 5-6(b)] would
relieve this pull considerably. This dip is what is called sag.
The same applies to stringing wire. When metallic wire is strung
tightly, it produces a greater strain on the insulator pins and on the pole.
Scientific sag is an important factor in stringing wire.
How the Weather Affects Conductors
As previously mentioned, a line sags more in hot weather and less
in cold weather. The reason for this is because conductors expand in hot
weather; in other words the length of the conductor increases as the
temperature increases. It follows that in cold weather the metallic con-
ductor will be shorter than in warm weather. If the wire were strung
without sag, it would snap during cold weather. On the other hand,
there is a chance a wire strung with too much sag would dip below the
Figure 5-4. Where possible, trees are trimmed.

specified clearance in warm weather (Figure 5-7).
For copper conductors, the change in length within a temperature
range of 100' to 0° is over 5 feet per 1000 feet; for aluminum the change
is almost 7 feet.
Besides the temperature, there are other factors that must be con-
sidered in determining the sag of a conductor; for example, the length
of the span, the weight of the conductors, wind, and ice loading. Also,
conductors must not touch each other when swaying in the wind. Tables
have been drawn up which consider all these factors and help the utility
company determine proper sag.
Figure 5-6. Illustration of sag. (a) A taut line causes strain on poles. (b)
With a properly sagged line, poles can easily withstand strain.

95
GUYING POLES
Guys
Earlier great detail was given about how carefully poles are chosen
to carry the load placed on them by the conductors. Careful specifica-
tions have been drawn regarding the length, strength, measurements,
and setting depth of a pole for every individual situation. In spite of all
this care and planning, situations arise where the conductor tries to force
the pole from its normal position. This happens because of abnormal
loads of ice, sleet, snow, and wind as well as because of broken lines,
uneven spans, corners, dead-ends, and hills.
When these cases of strain arise, the pole is strengthened and kept
in position by guys. Guys are braces or cables fastened to the pole. The
most commonly used form of guying is the anchor guy (see Figure 5-8).
Anchor Guys
The major components of an anchor wire, which are illustrated in
Figure 5-9, are the wire, clamps, the anchor, and sometimes a strain
insulator. The wire is usually copperweld, galvanized or bethanized
Figure 5-7. Conductor expansion. (a) Conductors shrink in cold
weather and expand in hot weather. (b) The line must never sag below
the minimum clearance. (c) The line must never be so tight that it
strains the poles.

steel. The guy is usually firmly attached to the pole by a thimble-eye or
by a guy eye bolt and a stubbing washer.
The wire is held firmly by the clamp while the bolt is being tight-
ened. Strain insulators were once commonly used on guy wires; how-
ever, they are unnecessary in grounded systems (which are more
prevalent).
A guy rod forms a connection between the anchor and the guy
wire.
Guy Guards
In the construction of anchor guys, the safety and welfare of the
public is of primary concern to the utility company. In well-traveled
areas, the part of the guy wire nearest the ground is covered with a
protector or guard. This serves a three-way purpose. (1) The guard
makes the wire more visible to prevent pedestrians from tripping; (2)
should a person walk into a guy wire, there is no chance of being cut by
Figure 5-8. Guys are used to keep poles in position.

the wire; and (3) it protects the guy wire from damage by cars or van-
dals.
At one time a guy guard consisted chiefly of a round metal tube or
some wooden blocks. The semiopen guard shown in Figure 5-10 was
later developed with rounded edges. This design is cheaper and easier
to install than other types of guy guards.
Sometimes temporary guying is necessary. In other words, there is
a chance that the land where the anchor is planted may later become
“off-limits” to the utility company. For example, a building may be built
there, or the owner may decide to construct a driveway. Whatever the
reason, screw type anchors (see Figure 5-11) are generally used in tem-
porary situations because they are easily retrievable. They need only be

98

screwed back up and they are ready to be used again. Extra large screw
anchors are also used where the soil is swampy or sandy.
Anchors
The value of an anchor is determined by its ability to hold the guy
wire under strain. At one time, logs (called dead-men) were buried in
the ground to anchor the guy wire. Initially, this was a pretty solid an-
chor. However, soil conditions often deteriorated the wood. In any case,
the digging of a hole large enough to bury a log is inordinately expen-
sive.
Today, manufacturers offer a wide variety of anchors-one to suit
every type of ground and every particular situation. Anchors can be
installed securely in the ground from swamp to solid rock (see Figure 5-
12).
Figure 5-10. Guy guards.

Overhead Construction
99
Types of Guys
In situations where an anchor guy is impractical because of cross-
ing a road, a span guy is used. In this form of guying, the guy wire
extends from the top of the pole to be guyed to the top of another pole
across the street, at approximately the same height. A span guy merely
transfers some strain from one pole to another [see Figure 5-13(a)].
Hence, a head guy or anchor guy [see Figure 5-13(b)] is usually used
with a span guy.
The head guy is a variation of the span guy, differing in that the
wire runs to a point somewhere below the top of the sustaining pole.
This type is rarely used in crossing a highway.
Specifications have been set up regarding clearances for guys, just
as for conductors.
When it would be difficult to achieve these clearances, a stub guy
is used [see Figures 5-13(c) and 5-13(d)]. A stub is just a piece of wood
to which the guy wire is attached. The guy must be attached to the stub
at some point 8 feet or more above ground. The stub guy wire must
allow enough clearance for traffic.

Overhead Construction
101
Should it prove necessary to guy a pole on private property, some
problems may arise. Sometimes owners object to a stub or anchor being
planted on their land, but they may approve of a guy wire being at-
tached to a tree [see Figure 5-13(e)]. This is certainly not recommended
practice, because a live tree is a very undependable sustainer. However,
there are cases where there is no other practical solution.
Where Guys Should Be Used
When a conductor terminates (dead-ends) on a pole, as shown in
Figure 5-14(a), a guy is attached to the pole to counteract the pull of the
conductors. In case of heavy construction where one guy is inadequate,
a guy may be used on the pole next to the last one.
Figure 5-13. How a span guy is used (a) and (b).

102
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
Sometimes there is the problem of a partial dead-end. In other
words, more wires are dead-ended on one side of a crossarm than on the
other. A guy is run from the side of the crossarm undergoing the worst
strain to the adjacent pole [see Figure 5-14(b)].
Corners are treated like dead-ends; however, since the pull on the
pole is in two directions, it is wise to use two guys to counteract the pull
in two directions, counterbalancing the pull of one set of wires [see Fig-
ure 5-14(c)].
When the conductors form an angle, the pole is submitted to an
additional stress. To balance these forces, side guys are attached as
shown in Figure 5-14(d) to the poles to take up the side pull.
Figure 5-13. (c) Straight and (d) raked stub guy.
Figure 5-13. (e) Tree used as stub guy. Not recommended practice.

Overhead Construction
103
When a pole is located on the slope of a hill, a head guy or an
anchor guy can be used to counteract the down-hill pull of conductors
[see Figure 5-14(e)].
When a branch line shoots from a pole, the weight of the branch
conductors causes a side pull. This side pull is counterbalanced by side
guys [see Figure 5-14(f)].
Figure 5-14. (a) Guy installed on terminal or dead-end pole.
Figure 5-14. (b) Crossarm guy compensates unbalanced pull on
crossarm.

104
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
When a line may be subjected to storms or other strong atmo-
spheric disturbances, storm guys are placed at regular intervals in the
line. Generally, four guys are used for this purpose-two line guys and
two side guys. All four guys are fastened to the same pole [see Figure
5-14(g)]. Line guys are attached from one pole to the other, thus doing
away with the necessity for anchors. Should one pole fail, damage will
be limited to the relatively small area between adjacent storm-guyed
poles, rather than have the entire line fall, pole after pole.
Other Methods of Sustaining Poles
Sometimes it is necessary to set poles in marshy or swampy land.
Since the ground does not hold the pole firmly in such a situation, a guy
is necessary. However, it is likely that the use of head or anchor guys
might be impractical or impossible for one reason or another. For ex-
ample, the ground might be too marshy to hold any pole, even a stub;
or there might be no available space for an anchor.
Here are some possible solutions.
Figure 5-14. (c) Two anchor guys sustaining a corner pole.
Figure 5-14. (d) Line making an angle.

Overhead Construction
105
The pole can be propped up with a push-brace [see Figure 5-15(a)].
Before a pole is planted in marshy land, an empty oil drum or a
tube of corrugated iron is set in the ground [see Figure 5-15(b)]. After the
pole is dropped in, the drum may be backfilled with dirt or concrete.
The area necessary for guying can be minimized by using a side-
walk guy [see Figure 5-15(c)].
Cribbing is necessary in marshy land when the pole must resist an
unbalanced load. It is also used in crowded or residential areas when
Figure 5-14. (c) Head guys counteract the pull on poles installed on a
steep hillside.
Figure 5-14. (f) A guy is used to counteract the side pull of a branch
line connection.

106
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
exposed guys would be dangerous, unsightly, or impractical. Cribbing
involves placing logs, stones, or other supports at the bottom of the pole
on one side and near the surface on the earth on the other side [Figure
5-15(d)). These objects counteract the strain being put on the pole from
one direction. As in the case of anchors, utility companies have found it
economical in some cases to replace logs with another cribbing device
called a pole key [see Figure 5-15(e)].
Joint Construction
For economy and appearance, it is often preferable to use one pole
for both power and communication lines (see Figure 5-16). This is
known as joint construction. Besides the power companies, telephone
companies are the biggest users of poles.
Telephone facilities may consist of open wires on crossarms or of
a cable supported on a “messenger.” Besides the power and telephone
companies, the fire department, the police department, the Coast Guard,
the railroad, Western Union, cable TV systems, and even private citizens
may have wires strung on the poles.
All these extra wires add a new factor to the problem of line de-
sign. Sometimes extra heavy poles or additional guying become neces-
sary, especially in the case of telephone cables. Distance must be

considered carefully between the conductors and equipment of the two
power facilities.
Usually the power companies and the communication companies
draw up contracts which specify the conditions under which both com-
panies may share the same facilities. Usual specifications include a mini-
mum of 40 inches spacing between these facilities.

Chapter 6
Underground
Construction
UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION
Where general appearance, economics, congestion, or maintenance
conditions make overhead construction inadvisable, underground con-
struction is specified. While overhead lines have been ordinarily consid-
ered to be less expensive and easier to maintain, developments in
underground cables and construction practices have narrowed the cost
gap to the point where such systems are competitive in urban and sub-
urban residential installations, which constitute the bulk of the distribu-
tion systems.
The conductors used underground (see Figure 6-1) are insulated
for their full length and several of them may be combined under one
outer protective covering. The whole assembly is called an electric cable.
These cables may be buried directly in the ground, or may be installed
in ducts buried in the ground. Concrete or metal markers are often in-
stalled at intervals to show the location of the cables.
In residential areas, such cables may be buried by themselves by
means of a plow or machine digging a narrow furrow. In commercial or
other congested areas, where maintenance repair or replacement of the
cables may be difficult, conduits or ducts and manholes may be installed
underground to contain the cable and other equipment. Figure 6-2 illus-
trates a typical underground setup of a conduit system.
RESIDENTIAL UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION
Underground Residential Distribution Layouts
Distribution circuits to residential areas are similar to overhead
designs, except the installation is underground. Primary mains, with

118
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
take-offs, are installed to which are connected the distribution trans-
formers that supply secondary low-voltage (120-240 volt) service to the
consumers. Two general patterns have developed, economy being the
deciding factor in the selection.
One pattern has as the primary supply a distribution transformer
which may feed two or more consumers via secondary mains and ser-
vices (see Figure 6-3).
Another pattern has as the primary supply individual transformers
feeding only one consumer (see Figure 6-4). No secondary mains are
required here, and the service connection to the consumer may be prac-
tically eliminated by placing the transformer adjacent to the consumer’s
service equipment.
The primary supply is of the radial type; that is, the feeders sup-
plying a territory “radiate” from their substation source, much as the
spokes of a wheel. Similarly, as is done in overhead circuits, the spurs or

laterals are connected to the primary main through fuses, so that a fault
on these laterals will not cause an interruption to the entire feeder.
However, as faults on underground systems may be more diffi-
cult to locate and take longer to repair than on overhead systems, the
primary supplies may often be arranged in the pattern of an open-
loop (see Figure 6-5). In this instance, the section of the primary on
which the fault has occurred may be disconnected at both ends and
service re-established by closing the loop at the point where it is nor-
mally left open. Such loops are not normally closed because a fault
on a section of the feed may then cause the fuses at both ends to
blow, leaving the entire area without supply and no knowledge of
where the fault has occurred.

COMMERCIAL UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION
Underground Commercial and Industrial Supply
Because commercial and industrial loads are heavier than in resi-
dential areas, three-phase supply is often installed. That is, in place of a
single two-wire—or so-called single-phase—source, a combination cir-
cuit of three such phases-or three-phase—as a source is used. Here, the
return, or neutral, wire of each of the three phases may be consolidated
into one common neutral wire for all of the phases; hence, only four
wires are required instead of six, making for economy.
Again, because these consumers may he located in congested areas
where digging may be difficult, cables and equipment may be installed
in ducts and manholes to facilitate maintenance and replacement.

formers.

Since some of the operations carried on by consumers of this type
are critical, the reliability of electric supply may be of such importance
as to warrant extra expenditures for firming up the supply. This may be
done by having a second source installed with automatic throw-over
devices (see Figure 6-6) so that should one source of supply fail, the
service may automatically be switched over to the alternate source.
An even more complex, and expensive, method is to create a low-
voltage network by connecting together, through switches called protec-
tors as shown in Figure 6-7, the secondary mains from transformers
supplied by several primary feeders. Here, should one feeder become
de-energized, the power is still supplied from the others without inter-

ruptions. The protector on the de-energized feeder automatically opens
to prevent a “feedback” from the other feeders back (through the trans-
former) to the de-energized feeder.
UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION—DIRECT BURIAL
Buried Cable
The installation of cable directly in the ground saves the cost of
building conduits and manholes and allows the use of long sections of
cable, thereby eliminating the necessity for a number of splices.
The cable may be buried alone in a trench, or may be buried in a
trench together with other facilities, including telephone cables, gas
mains, water, or sewer systems (see Figure 6-8). Sharing the cost of in-
stalling such facilities jointly contributes greatly to the economy of un-
derground distribution systems. The width and depth of the trench are
dictated by the number and type of facilities to be installed and by
National Electric Safety Code (NESC) requirements; a typical arrange-
ment is shown in Figure 6-9. Where only one cable is involved, to avoid
the cost of digging and backfilling the trench, and to disturb the surface
as little as possible, the cable is sometimes installed by a plow which
furrows the earth to the required depth, lays the cable, and presses the

sod back in place after the plow has passed. Joints on this underground
cable are buried directly in the ground.
UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION—CABLES
Underground Cable Sheath
In underground work, cables must be sheathed for protection from
mechanical injury during installation, from moisture, gasses, chemicals
(see Figure 6-10), and other damaging substances in the soil or atmo-
sphere. Sheathing must have specific properties to meet the varying
Figure 6-7. Secondary underground network. Protector switches are
used to prevent feedback.

Electrical Power Distribution Systems
conditions. At one time, almost all cables were lead-sheathed because
lead is almost completely moisture proof and a good mechanical buffer;
but it may be corroded by some chemicals. New types of plastics which
do not deteriorate from exposure to any weather, sunlight, moisture, and
chemicals have largely taken the place of the more expensive and less
flexible lead sheathing. Earlier neoprene, polyethylene, and
polyvinylchloride (PVC) sheaths have given way to plastics com-
pounded to meet the more demanding particular needs of direct-burial
installations.
The other essential parts of a sheathed cable are the conductors and
the insulation.

burial of gas main, secondary cable, street light cable, and telephone
cable with the primary cable.

Underground Construction
125
Conductors
The conductors are usually made of copper or aluminum and are
stranded, except for the smaller sizes, to make the cable flexible. As the
conductor has to support practically no weight, it is usually made of
Figure 6-9. Plowing cable for an underground system. This machine
digs trench, buries cable, and backfills sod in one operation.
Figure 6-10. Underground cable protection provided by the sheath.

126
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
soft-drawn copper. The size is specified in circular mils or in American
Wire Gage numbers exactly the same as for overhead conductors.
Cables can be either single-conductor or multiple-conductor (see
Figure 6-11); that is, one, two, three, or four conductors may be enclosed
in a single sheath. Putting two or more conductors into one sheath is an
economic measure, as only one cable is handled rather than several
where they are installed in a trench or duct, and only one sheath is
necessary. Where the cable is to be tapped rather frequently, as in service
connections, secondary or primary distribution mains, and street light-
ing facilities, single conductor cables are generally used because of the
ease in making the necessary splices. Multiple-conductor cables are usu-
ally used for mainline portions of primary distribution circuits, or trans-
mission lines, where few or no taps or take-offs exist.
Insulation
Plastics occupy a prominent place in the field of insulation for
cables operating at low and moderate voltages (up to 69,000 volts),
though rubber-mineral compounds may be used for special applications.
For cables of moderate and high voltage application (from 69,000 volts
upward) oil-impregnated paper tape is widely used. Plastic insulation is
applied to the conductor under pressure. Paper insulation is wrapped
around the conductor and impregnated with oil before the sheath is
applied. Sheaths may be of lead, though more frequently, plastics are
being used for this purpose.
Armor
Where cable is buried directly in the ground, it is often constructed
with armor which may consist of galvanized-steel wire wrapped around
the sheath. While this armor primarily serves to protect the cable from
mechanical damage during and after installation, it can also serve as a
return or ground conductor as part of the electric circuit. This is espe-
cially true in the case of lower voltage service or secondary cables.
Submarine Cable
In crossing bodies of water, the ordinary plastic or lead covered
cable is usually protected with a wrapping of tarred jute, and armored
with galvanized-steel wire (see Figure 6-12). The armor wire is usually
more substantial than that for cables buried in the ground, and serves
also as mechanical reinforcement during installation.

Underground Construction
127
Where submarine cable is not likely to be disturbed, it is laid di-
rectly on the bed of the body of water, but where the current or naviga-
tion is likely to disturb it, the cable is laid in a protective trench blown
or dug in the stream bed. Special anchors are sometimes used so that the
force of a vigorously changing tide or moving water cannot shift the
cable. Sometimes, these cables may be encased in concrete (see Figure 6-
13 in the section that follows).

conductor cable.

Electrical Power Distribution Systems
UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION—DUCTS
Cable in Conduit
Installing cables in underground conduit or duct systems is a more
complex and costly operation than burying them directly in the ground.
Conduits
Underground cable is carried and protected by different types of
ducts or conduits. The most commonly used types of conduit or duct are
shown in Figure 6-13: precast concrete, plastic, fiber, and wrought iron
pipe. The first three are usually used because of their lower cost. Because
wrought iron pipe is comparatively costly, its use is generally limited to
places where the space for conduits is shallow and where rigidity and
strength are required. Conduits installed under roadways or other places
subject to severe loading are sometimes encased in concrete.
Ducts are usually made in sizes from 1 inch to 6 inches (inside
diameters), ranging in steps of 1/2 inch, that is 1, 1-1/2, 2, 2-1/2, and so
on. The size of the duct depends on the size of the cable to be installed
at the present or on any probable size to be installed in the future. It
should always be large enough to make cable installation as easy as
possible.
Very often, in installing conduits, spare ducts as shown in Figure
6-14 are provided for future use. In the illustration, the white-capped
ducts are in use; the black ones are spares.
In installing the duct run (see Figure 6-15), it should be kept free
of bends as much as possible so as to simplify the pulling in of the cable.
For the same reason, the duct runs between manholes should not be too
Figure 6-13. Ducts.

129
long. If bends are necessary, they should be constructed with the greatest
possible radius. The ducts should also be graded slightly, that is, they
should slope gently toward one or both ends, to allow any water that
may seep into them to drain off.
UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION—MAN HOLES
Manholes
A manhole, more accurately termed a splicing chamber or cable
vault, is an opening in the underground system where workers may
enter to install cables or other equipment, and to make connections and
tests.
Manholes provide test points for the various circuits carried
through them. They permit grouping the circuits as desired by the en-
gineer, and they make emergency connections and maintenance possible
and efficient.
Manholes are placed in underground systems to facilitate cable
pulling. The distance between manholes depends on many conditions,
but they are seldom over 500 feet apart. In built-up areas, they are usu-

lation of plastic conduits.

Electrical Power Distribution Systems
ally located near street intersections. In addition to accommodating the
cable or other equipment to be installed, they should be designed so that
the cables may be readily racked around the manhole and they should
allow sufficient space for a splicer to work (see Figure 6-16).
The type, shape, and size of a manhole depends on many condi-
tions—location of manhole, whether at an intersection or in the middle
of a block; size and type of cables to be carried through the manhole;
and location of gas or water pipes, or other subsurface structures. It
should be deep enough to provide working head-room (see Figures 6-17
and 6-18) and drainage for the duct lines. The dimensions of a manhole
are also determined by the number of ducts entering the manhole, the
different levels on which they enter, the type of cable to be racked, and
the length of the splice, as well as by other types of equipment to be
installed (switches, transformers, etc.).
Manholes are generally built of reinforced concrete or brick and the
covers are made of steel. The section leading from the street to the man-
hole proper is usually called the “chimney” or “throat” (see Figure 6-19).
Both manholes and ducts are often precast into the sizes and
shapes desired and installed as integral parts of the underground sys-
tem. This is often the quickest, most economical way to install under-
Figure 6-16. Cables spliced and racked in a manhole.

ground facilities, eliminating the inconveniences that often accompany
the field pouring of concrete, especially in crowded streets and avenues.
Drainage and Waterproofing of Manholes
Water can accumulate at the bottom of manholes. If the soil is
normal, natural drainage will easily occur. However, if there is less than
Figure 6-17. A manhole must provide ample headroom for workers.

and (b) side view.

perfect soil, some form of drainage should be provided. Where sewer
connections can be made conveniently, this is usually done. In most
cases where the bottom of the manhole is below the natural water table
or where the earth will not support the manhole structure on the wall
footings alone, it is good practice to provide a concrete floor and a sump
(or well) where the water can collect and drain off into a storm sewer or
some other part of the ground.
In many cases, the bottom of the manhole is excavated and filled
with stones to make a dry well. (See Figure 6-20.)
There are areas where the soil is so moist and the water table so
high that it is wise to make the manholes as waterproof as possible.
Along the waterfront in cities, for example, the manholes are constructed
of water-proofed concrete. For extra protection, the concrete is some-
times painted with a waterproof paint.

133
UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION—CABLE INSTALLATION
Pulling Cable through a Conduit
When installing a cable into an underground conduit, it is possible
that the engineer can choose from several conduits. If so, the choice is
made with the following stipulations in mind: (1) avoid unnecessary
cable crossings in the manholes, (2) avoid obstructing other empty ducts,
and (3) keep the cables cool and safely distant from other cables.
After the conduit has been chosen, it must be cleaned. At this point
the pulling line is often installed in the conduit. However, often the
pulling line is placed in the conduit at the time of its original installation.
Manila or steel wire rope are commonly used materials for pulling lines.
Pulling the cable through the conduit requires a reel of cable prop-
erly placed at the feeding end and a winch, capstan, or truck at the
pulling end (see Figure 6-21). Different companies have different means
of attaching the conductor or cable to the pulling line.
To protect the cable from injury during installation, the cable is
usually greased lightly (about 100 lb of grease per mile of cable). The
Figure 6-20. Typical manhole with dry well for drainage of rain water.

134
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
feeding end of the conduit is smooth and it is good practice to pull the
cable slowly.
Joints or Splices
Sections of cables installed in underground ducts are connected in
the manhole to form a continuous length. This connection is called a
joint or splice. Whenever two cables are spliced together, the connection
is called a straight splice. It is possible to connect more than two cables
together; these are known as three-way, four-way, and so on, splices.
Where joints or splices are made in cables buried directly in the
ground, the splice may be also buried directly, or may be protected by
a splice box or chamber surrounding the joint.
Where cables having plastic insulation and sheathing are used, the
splices may utilize prefabricated insulation covers, and the entire opera-
tion simplified, as compared to cables having other insulation and lead
sheaths.
Connections-Terminals
In some instances, particularly where plastic insulated cables of
underground residential systems are involved, cables may be connected
together through a completely insulated terminal block containing a
number of stud connectors, the entire assembly covered with molded
Figure 6-21. Some methods of pulling cable through a duct. (a) Feed-
ing cable into a duct, (b) simple rigging-blocks and wedges, (c) eye

135
insulation, as shown in Figure 6-22(a). The conductor is connected to the
stud and the insulation and sheath of the cable are taped to the insula-
tion and molded protection of the insulated terminal block. The terminal
may also consist of molded load-break elbows and bushings, as depicted
in Figure 6-22(b). The conductor is connected to an insulated stud that
fits into an insulated receptacle. The conductor may be disconnected
safely by means of an insulated hook stick that pulls the stud from the
receptacle. The molded terminal may be combined with similar type ter-
minals of transformers and other equipment. These disconnecting de-
vices may serve as test points in finding and isolating faults, in restoring
service after an interruption, and lend flexibility rearranging circuits as
well as energizing and deenergizing primary circuits and equipment.
Cable Racking in Manholes
As the cable expands and contracts, the sheath may crack. That’s
why it is very important to rack the cables in the manhole so that this
movement can take place safely. The best way to accomplish this is to
provide a large reverse curve in the cable passing through the manhole.
This reverse curve, consisting of one or two large radius 90-degree
bends, enables the cable to take up the expansion movements and mini-
mizes the danger of the lead sheath cracking or buckling. This arrange-
ment also minimizes the relative movement between the cable and the
Figure 6-22. (a) Premolded typical “T” splice assembly. (Photo courtesy

joint at the point where the joint is wiped to the cable sheath.
Splices in manholes are usually supported on racks mounted on
the walls. As the splice is a vulnerable spot, the cable ends must not
hang on it; this would tend to pull the splice apart.
Cables should bear some identifying mark (see Figure 6-23) in the
manholes through which they pass. This is usually in the form of a metal
tag tied to the splice. The tags indicate the size, voltage, feeder designa-
tion, and other pertinent information.
Arc-Proofing Cables
Where more than one high-voltage cable passes through a man-
hole, the splices and cables are fire-proofed with a covering of sand and
cement, or some fire proof material. This is to prevent spread of fire or
explosion, should a splice or cable fail, to other cables, with consequent
damage.
First, the cables to be fire-proofed (or arc-proofed) (Figure 6-24) are
formed and racked into their final position. In the situation described,
three single-conductor cables are being arc-proofed together. These are
tied together with twine. If splices are present, the twine is wound only at
the ends, not over the splices. Now two layers of special-reinforced tape
are applied around the bound-together cables. The second layer must be
carefully wound so that the joints occur just between the joints of the first

layer. Both ends of each layer must be secured with twine.
For safety, a drain wire is wound around the tape and connected
to ground. This is usually a solid soft-drawn #6 copper wire mesh,

between turns. At each end, the turns are wrapped closely and enough
left over for connecting  to  the  ground.  The  insulating-cement  (about
3/8-inch thick) is rubbed into the insulating tape, which is wet and
smoothed off the rubber gloves or a trowel. The last step is to connect
the drain wire to ground.
UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION—RISERS
Risers and Potheads
It has already been mentioned that the utility company only resorts
to underground construction where it is necessary, where congestion,
maintenance conditions, or appearance make overhead construction
impractical.
Therefore, in a long-distance transmission or distribution system, it
is possible that once the conductors have passed underground through
some crowded area, they may be able to connect to overhead lines in a
more scattered area.
To make this underground-to-overhead connection, the cable is led
out of the manhole and up the side of the pole through a curved length
of pipe. The cable terminates in a pothead or weatherhead (see Figure 6-
25). The whole assembly is known as a riser.
A weatherhead is a simpler underground-overhead connector; but
it can only be used for low voltages, that is, to connect underground
secondary cables to overhead secondary or service wires.
A pothead (shown in Figure 6-26) contains the connection between
an underground cable and an overhead wire. Inside the pothead, all the
conductors wrapped into one cable are separated into two, three, or
more conductors for overhead attachment through a porcelain-encased
terminal for each conductor. These terminals or arms have petticoats the
same as insulators do and serve the same purpose. The sheathed cable
is attached to the pothead by a wiped joint or by a clamping device. The
overhead wires are connected to the terminals. Before this connection is
made, the pot is filled with a liquid insulating compound which must be
allowed to cool before the pothead can be moved.
On distribution lines where the line equipment must be handled
while the line is alive, a disconnecting-type pothead (see Figure 6-27) is
used either for single or multiple-conductor cables (see Figure 6-28).
These potheads also consist of a pot (or container of insulating com-

Underground Construction
139
pound) and of porcelain tubes for the outlets to the overhead lines. They
differ from ordinary potheads in that the tubes are covered with a
weatherproof cap provided with a terminal which is constructed in such
a manner that when the cap is removed, the circuit is interrupted. The
cable terminals thus permit the opening of the line. Such an arrangement
is useful in locating trouble. Potheads also provide a means of restoring
service to a partly faulted line by transferring the supply to an adjoining
main.
With the creation of plastic insulated and sheathed cables, connec-
tions may be made directly to the overhead conductors. The insulation
about the underground conductor is tapered at the end of which a hot-
line clamp may be mounted. Conical rain shields are sometimes in-
stalled at the point where the conductor is attached to the clamp. The
clamp may be operated by means of a hot-line stick in connecting and
disconnecting the cable conductor and the energized overhead conduc-

tor. Each conductor of a multiconductor cable is handled individually.
The economy, ease, and flexibility of operation compared to pothead
installations are obvious.
OVERHEAD CABLE
Overhead Sheathed Cables
For appearance or to avoid congestion, it is sometimes necessary to
continue circuits by means of sheathed cable suspended on poles. This
cable is supported by means of rings attached to a tightly strung, heavy
steel cable (see Figure 6-29) called a messenger. More recently, instead of
rings, the cable is supported by a wire wrapped around both the cable

141
and the messenger by a spinning machine (see Figure 6-30). Bad tree
conditions are another reason for overhead sheathed cables.
Because of the pull imposed on the poles by this tightly strung
messenger, and because of the weight of the cable, the pole line must be
very strongly constructed and heavily guyed. Since there is enough in-
sulation between the conductors and the lead sheath, no insulators are
used for cable work. This cable expands and contracts just as do the
conductors in an overhead system and it will sometimes rub against the
Figure 6-27. Heat shrinkable pothead.

pole. To prevent damage from this rubbing, the cable is sometimes “bel-
lied” out around the pole, as shown in Figure 6-31(a) and (b). Otherwise,
some type of mechanical protectors such as steel plates are used.

Service Factors
SERVICE FACTORS
If all the lights, irons, washing machines, refrigerators, television
sets, motors, and other equipment in all the consumers’ premises were
to be turned on at one time, it would be impossible for the utility com-
pany to supply the energy necessary to run all these appliances. For a
company to install generators, transformers, transmission and distribu-
tion lines, and other equipment to provide for this total connected load
would be extremely uneconomical since all this equipment will not be
operating at the same time. Therefore, studies are made of the personal
habits of people and the routines of households, offices, stores, and fac-
tories, to determine what probable load the utility company will have to
supply at any one time (see Figure 7-1). Although holidays, the season
of the year, the weather, and many other factors contribute to make such
studies difficult, this effort is necessary to keep the cost of electric service
within everyone’s range. Figure 7-2 illustrates typical peak and off-peak
load periods.
Maximum Demand
The amount of electricity a consumer uses at any given moment is
called his “demand.” It varies from hour to hour. The highest value
which the demand reaches is called the “maximum demand” (see Figure
7-3). It is evident then that this maximum demand for electricity (and
not the actual consumption of electricity) determines the size and type
of equipment necessary to supply the consumer. The higher the maxi-
mum demand, the larger and more expensive must be the apparatus
necessary to carry it, from the watt-hour meter all the way back to the
power house.
The maximum demand may exist for only a very short while or it
may last for a considerable period. For practical purposes it is taken as
the highest 15-minute (or half-hourly or hourly) demand during the
billing period, usually 1 month.

146
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
Load Factor
On this basis, it is clear that the consumer with a large maximum
demand requires a larger investment on the part of the utility company
than one with a small maximum demand. But, before any conclusions
can be drawn as to their relative value as consumers, something must be
known about their consumption of electricity as well as their maximum
demands. If a consumer approaches this maximum demand often dur-
ing the day, his or her consumption of electricity will be large. If the
average demand in a given period of time is taken and compared to the
maximum demand, the percentage is an estimate of the extent to which
the facilities are used. This comparison, known as the load factor (see
Figure 7-4) is actually the ratio between the average demand and the
maximum demand in percent form.
Figure 7-1. Service factors. Very low demand: (a) Consumer A has only
one lamp on—no other appliances running. Higher demand: (b) Con-
sumer B is cooking, washing, and running a TV. (c) The factory
reaches its maximum demand during the day. But most factories are
closed at night when (d) the domestic demand reaches its peak.

a typical utility company supplies consumers in an average month.
Note consistently low peaks on Sunday.
Figure 7-3. The utility company must be equipped to meet the
consumer’s maximum demand.
Even though the capacity of the installation is determined by the
maximum demand, the load factor is of great importance because the
use (and consequently the revenue) from the installation is governed by
the average load. Considering the daily load factor, it is easy to imagine

148
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
two consumers using the same maximum demand but having entirely
different average loads. For instance, one may use this maximum de-
mand steadily for 24 hours—a 100 percent load factor. The other con-
sumer may use that demand for only an hour while the rest of the day
only 10 percent of the maximum demand is used. Both consumers re-
quire the same investment in capacity while using that capacity in an
entirely different manner.
The two consumers shown in the comparative graphs in Figure 7-
5 have the same maximum demand. However, one uses his or her maxi-
mum for 1-1/2 hours—the other for 15 minutes. Their average demands
vary by 15 amperes. Their load factors vary even more considerably,
consumer A having 60 percent and consumer B only 30 percent.
Similarly, consider two houses; one used as a year-’round resi-
dence, the other for only the three summer months. Assume, too, that
both have the same average demands and the same maximum demands;
their load factors will also be the same. However, it is evident that one
will use its installed facilities four times as fruitfully as the other.
Another factor often used is the use factor. This is the same as the
load factor but the capacity installed is used instead of the maximum
demand. It is usually less than the load factor.

149
Load Characteristics
Each use of electrical energy has its own characteristics. The street
lighting load—while it is on—has almost a 100 percent load factor. The
domestic load (for homes) has a very high evening peak and varies
enormously depending on the appliances used (Figure 7-6). Industrial
load curves vary with the specific industry but generally are typified by
two peaks, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
Annual load curves show less variation than daily load curves. The
peak load for the year, referred to as the system peak, often occurs
during the two weeks before the end of the year, around the Christmas
season. With the widespread use of air-conditioning, this system peak
often occurs during the summer months.
If the average daily load curves taken for a whole year are placed
in a row from January to December, the result is the mountainous graph
shown in Figure 7-7. This “mountain range” is a good indication of
America’s daily electricity-usage behavior patterns. Peaks are always
higher for weekdays than for Saturday and Sunday.
There is a consistent slope from 12 midnight until 3 AM indicating
Figure 7-5. The load factor indicates how two consumers with the
same maximum demand use their facilities in different quantities.

late workers and night owls going home. The curve is kept up during
the night by the streetlighting load. Early risers account for the moun-
tain rising again around 5 AM. Around 7 AM, the rise is sharp because
of breakfast and transportation to work. By 9 AM, the peak of morning
activity is reached. This slackens as transportation to work slows up.
Noon, being the usual lunch-hour, consistently causes a gulch in
the graphs. Note that the gulch moves back an hour during daylight
saving time. Daily peaks are almost always reached around 7 in the
evening when family activity takes place.
This peak slips down around 9 PM as the family goes to bed.
Daylight saving time causes an exception to this rule because people
stay outdoors later in the day.
Weather and special events cause variations in this pattern. A sum-
mer storm will put the evening load at its winter peak. The evening load
may be extended by some special radio or television program after 9
PM.
Diversity Factor
The time of the maximum demand of each consumer is important.
Consider two houses with the same maximum demand but occurring at
different times. If these two houses were fed from the same feeder, the
demand on the feeder would be less than the sum of the two demands.
This condition is known as diversity. If we compare the actual maximum
demand on the feeder with the sum of the maximum demands of all the
consumers supplied by the feeder (regardless of when they occur), the
relationship, expressed in percent, is known as the diversity factor. The
diversity factor can, therefore, never be less than one and may be as high
as ten or more. The diversity factor of a feeder would be the sum of the
maximum demands of the individual consumers divided by the maxi-
mum demand of the feeder (see Figure 7-8). In a similar manner, it is
possible to compute the diversity factor on a substation, a transmission
line, or a whole utility system.
Diversity factor and load factor are closely related. The smaller the
load factors, the less chance of the maximum demands of two loads
being simultaneous. The domestic load has the highest diversity factor;
but the diversity factor decreases with the increase of appliances. Indus-
trial loads have low diversity factors, usually in the neighborhood of 1.4,
street light practically unity, and other loads vary between these limits.
The actual facilities installed by the utility company provide for the

152
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
maximum probable loads, rather than maximum possible loads in any
portion of the system. Thus, it will be seen that considerable savings in
investment are brought about by taking advantage of all these factors.
Demand Suppression
It has been shown how the maximum demands not only of indi-
vidual consumers, but also of their effect collectively on the maximum
demand, impose on the conductors and equipment of a distribution
system. Measures to reduce these maximum demands result in a lesser
need for costly generating facilities with further reductions realized from
decreased losses in both transmission and distribution systems. And
many of the measures also include reductions in consumers’ consump-
tions by replacement of lighting, heating, air-conditioning, and some
power devices with more efficient units.
In general, the reduction in demands, sometimes also called peak
shaving, is accomplished by dropping interruptible loads, and by control-
ling major load units by means of relays and circuitry that restricts their
coincidental energization. Concentration on large industrial and com-
mercial consumers not only produces larger results but may be more
quickly and easily achieved. Similar measures are taken in the case of
residential consumers. Major appliances such as clothes and dish wash-
ers, air conditioners, water heaters, and so on, may also be wired
through relays so that they do not turn on at the same time. In some
instances, they may be metered separately. These meters, as well as some
of the relays, may be operated by radio signals or other type control at

regularly scheduled time periods or predetermined demand levels. In all
cases, promotional rates (for decreased consumption and demand) may
be employed.
SERVICE WIRES
Services-Overhead
The electrical circuit between the company’s mains and the
consumer’s wiring is called the service. A consumer’s service or service
connection is the set of wires that is tapped onto the secondary mains
and is connected to the consumer’s wiring. These wires are also known
as the service drop. It is the last link of the path over which the electrical
energy is brought to the consumer.
An overhead service (see Figure 7-9) consists of wires or cables
extending from a pole carrying the main to a point on the consumer’s
building. The service may consist of two or more conductors. The con-
Figure 7-9. Overhead secondary service. (a) Concentric or twisted
cable, and (b) open wire.

154
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
ductors may be covered with some insulation and contained together in
a cable or twisted together. The conductors may also be bare or weath-
erproof wire. This latter type is known as an open wire service and in such
installations the wires are supported by the insulators and brackets at-
tached to both the pole and building. In any case, the conductors are
usually supported so there will be no pull on the splice or connection.
Services—Underground
Underground services (see Figure 7-10) consist of plastic or lead
covered cables which extend from the consumer’s service point on his or
her premises to the mains to which they are connected. These mains can
be cables directly buried in the ground, or located in a manhole or splice
box; or they may also be connected to overhead mains on a pole through
a “riser” which runs down the side of the pole. Like overhead services,
they may consist of two or more conductors which may be in the form
of two or more single conductor cables or one multiconductor cable.
These service cables are often installed in a steel or concrete duct, for at
least that portion on the consumer’s premises, for safety reasons.
Sizes of Service Wires
The size of the service conductors depends on the maximum de-
mand of the particular consumer. In order to allow some margin of
safety and to keep the number of different sizes of conductors to a mini-
mum, certain standard sizes of wires are set up to supply certain ranges
of demand (see Figure 7-11). These are given in Table 7-1. Remember
that these sizes are selected not only to carry the load, but to do so
without appreciable loss in pressure or voltage.
WATT-HOUR METERS
The electric meter is essentially a small electric motor, capable of
considerable accuracy. It is connected in the circuit so that the number
of turns of the disc is in direct proportion to the amount of electricity
flowing through the circuit. The number of revolutions of the motor are
counted and recorded on the dials through a system of gears. This sys-
tem of gears and the dials constitute what is known as the register.
When a meter is equipped with just this register, it is known as a
watt-hour meter. This is the type of meter usually installed in residences

where only the actual consumption of electricity is measured. Although
it would be desirable to measure the maximum demand in these cases,
the expense of the additional equipment is not warranted.
Two types of watt-hour meters (see Figure 7-12) are manufactured:
the so-called A-base type and the “socket” or S type.
A-Base Watt-Hour Meter
The A-base has the terminals of the meter terminating in a block at
the base of the meter and is essentially an indoor type of meter. A sepa-
rate enclosing box is required when it is installed outdoors. The meter
is mounted flush above a meter box through which the service conduc-
tors pass and in which the necessary connections are made. This box is
sealed to prevent energy diversion.
The Socket Watt-Hour Meter
The socket or type S meter shown in Figure 7-13 has its terminals
connected to bayonets or plugs in the back of the meter which fit into
receptacles acting as terminals for the service conductors. No separate
connections to the meter are necessary. The meter sets flush on the
socket and is locked in place with a ring which is sealed. This type
meter, which may be mounted either outdoors or indoors, reduces meter

margin of safety.

installation to simply plugging in the instrument and sealing the ring.
Outdoor meters are coming into wider use as they facilitate reading,
testing, and replacement without disturbing the consumer. The socket
type meter can be quickly replaced, with only a very brief interruption
of service.
Meter Registers
An important part of the meter is the revolution counter from
which the consumers’ bills are determined. These registers are made in
two types: the conventional dial type, and the cyclometer type.
In the dial type, the revolutions are counted on four dials (see Fig-
ure 7-14): the one at the extreme right registers units of electricity con-
sumed. The second dial from the right is actuated by the one at the
extreme right through a set of gears having a ratio of 10:1, so that it
makes 1 complete turn for every 10 turns made by the one on the ex-
treme right. Similarly, the third dial from the right is actuated by the dial
second from the right through another 10:1 ratio set of gears—so that it
makes 1 turn for every 10 made by the dial second from the right and
for every 100 made by the dial at the extreme right. Again, the left hand
dial or the dial fourth from the right is actuated by the dial third from
the right through another 10: 1 ratio set of gears—so that it makes 1 turn
Figure 7-12. Two types of watt-hour meters. (a) A-base and (b) socket
S-type.

158
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
for every 10 made by the dial third from the right, 100 made by the dial
second from the right, and 1000 made by the dial at the extreme right.
Some registers have five dials where the left dial makes 1 turn for every
10,000 made by the dial at the extreme right.
Hence, the register measures the units of electricity passing
through the meter: reading the right hand dial first, the number nearest
the pointer is read; then the dial second from the right is read in the
same manner giving the number of ten units measured; then the dial
third from the right in the same manner giving the number of hundred
units measured; and, finally the first dial or fourth from the right is read
in the same manner giving the number of thousand units measured.
In the cyclometer type register (shown in Figure 7-15), although the
action is the same as in the conventional type, the dial faces are replaced

by wheels which indicate numbers directly, making possible the reading
of the meter directly, from left to right. This simplifies reading of the
meter and takes some of the mystery out of the meter for the average
consumer.
Billing is accomplished by taking the difference in readings of the
meter at two successive times at an interval of usually one month. The
difference in readings indicates the amount of electricity (in kilowatt
hours) used by the consumer in that period. This is multiplied by the
appropriate rate and the bill is rendered to the consumer (see Figure 7-
16).

160
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
Watt-Hour Demand Meters
For large consumers, it is profitable to measure the actual maxi-
mum demand. This is done by adding another dial and set of gears to
the watt-hour meter, converting it to a demand meter. There are two
hands on this dial, one of which is connected to the actuating mecha-
nism and the other just “floats,” being pushed along by the first hand.
The first hand measures the number of revolutions made in a standard
period of time—15 minutes (in special instances a half-hour or an hour).
At the end of this period, another mechanism operates to return the first
hand to zero and the process starts all over. In the meantime, the second
hand having been pushed by the first hand, remains at the last place
before the first hand is returned to zero. Hence, the second hand mea-
sures the maximum demand of the consumer. A meter equipped with
only this second type of gear set and dial is known as a demand meter
(see Figure 7-17). Where a meter is equipped with both sets of gears and
dials, it is known as a watt-hour demand meter.
In reading this type of meter for billing purposes, the regular four
dials are read for the kilowatt hour consumption and then the floating
hand is read for the kilowatt demand. Through a lever protruding
through the case, this floating hand is returned to zero each time the
meter is read, preparing it to register the maximum demand for the next
metering period; this lever is locked to prevent tampering.
Since a record of this maximum demand value is lost as soon as the
floating hand is returned to zero, a cumulative type of demand register
has been developed, which translates this reading of the floating hand
to another set of dials on another register similar to the one measuring
consumption. The demand reading on this register stays put, being

available for checking, until the meter
is next read, when the lever or
plunger which returns the “floating”
hand to zero causes the new maxi-
mum demand to be added to the
original reading: the new reading will
then be greater than the previous one
by the current period’s maximum de-
mand.
SERVICE EQUIPMENT
When the meter is placed in-
doors, the service conductors coming into the consumers’ premises ter-
minate in a cut-out box. This is merely a point at which the service wires
can be disconnected from the house wiring. It may be a switch and each
conductor may or may not be fused. From this point, the wires extend
to another box associated with the meter. This second box holds the
terminals for the meter and a special switch which permits testing the
meter without interrupting service. Where only one meter of small size
is installed, the service cut-out box, the meter terminal, and test box may
be combined in one cabinet. In any case, these boxes are all locked with
a seal which must be broken when they are opened. This is done to
prevent the theft of electricity by by-passing or tampering with the
meter. In more recent installations, the positions of these two boxes are
reversed, the box associated with the meter comes first and the switch
box next (see Figure 7-18).
The equipment to this point, with the exception of the meter, may
or may not be owned by the consumer. In all cases, however, the utility
company owns the meter.
The service from this point is then connected to a distribution
panel which supplies the circuit to the various parts of the consumer’s
premises. These circuits are usually protected at the distribution panel
[see Figure 7-19(a)] so that in the event of an overload, or an accidental
short circuit in one of the circuits, only a fuse or breaker will operate and
service to the remaining parts of the consumers’ premises will not be
interrupted. Most installations today provide that this panel may be
contained in the same box as the switch.
Figure 7-17. The register of a
demand meter—for large
consumers.

162
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
When the meter is placed outdoors, there is no need for the box
providing a point to connect or test the meter. The remaining distribu-
tion panel is still required and is usually installed inside the consumer’s
premises.
For safety purposes, one conductor is connected to ground, usually
to a driven rod or pipe or other metallic structure [see Figure 7-19(b)].
This is done so that if an accidental contact of an energized conductor
takes place, the energy is conducted to the ground and possibility of
electric shock reduced. For this reason, a fuse is never placed in the cir-
cuit of this “neutral” or ground conductor.
REMOTE METER READING AND DEMAND CONTROL
Electronic developments that have made e-mail (and the Internet)
inexpensive and universal means of communication have also made
practical the remote reading of consumer’s meters. Periodic inquiry

automatically sent to each consumer identifies their meter and records
the dial consumption and other data, transmitting them to the computer
center where they may be automatically processed, producing the bill
sent to the consumer.
In some cases, usually commercial or industrial consumers, where
it is desired to hold down their demands by arranging their individual
loads not to coincide, and where practical to be scheduled for off peak
hours (usually evening and early morning hours), the same means of
communication is used to operate relays and switches to accomplish this
purpose, often employing the same meter reading facilities.

Substations
FUNCTIONS OF A SUBSTATION
Substations serve as sources of energy supply for the local areas
of distribution in which they are located. Their main functions as
shown in Figure 8-1 are to receive energy transmitted at high voltage
from the generating stations, reduce the voltage to a value appropri-
ate for local use, and provide facilities for switching. Substations have
some additional functions. They provide points where safety devices
may be installed to disconnect circuits or equipment in the event of
trouble. Voltage on the outgoing distribution feeders can be regulated
at a substation. A substation is a convenient place to make measure-
ments to check the operation of various parts of the system. Street
lighting equipment as well as on-and-off controls for street lights can
be installed in a substation though this is a diminishing function.
Some substations are simply switching stations where different
connections can be made between various transmission lines.
TYPES OF SUBSTATIONS
Some substations are entirely enclosed in buildings as shown in
Figure 8-2(a), while others are built entirely in the open [see Figure 8-
2(b)], for example, unit substations. In this type, all the equipment is
assembled into one metal clad unit usually enclosed by a fence. Other
substations have step-down transformers, high-voltage switches and oil
circuit breakers, and lightning arresters located just outside the substa-
tion building within which are located the distribution and street light-
ing facilities.
Sites for substations are generally selected so that the stations will
be as near as possible to the load center of the distribution areas which
they are intended to serve. Availability of land, cost, local zoning laws,

166
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
future load growth, and taxes are just a few of the many factors which
must be considered before a site is ultimately chosen.
Substations may have an operator in attendance (see Figure 8-3)
part or all of the day, or they may be entirely unattended. In unat-
tended substations, all equipment function automatically, or may be
operated by remote control from an attended substation or from a
control center.
UNIT SUBSTATIONS
Utility companies at one time concentrated many feeders into a
few big, attended distribution substations. Each one of these substa-
tions had to be individually engineered and there was little standard-
ization.
However, the unit substation offers considerable economy in in-
vestment and installation. These factory-built, metal-enclosed units
which usually supply only a few feeders give the system a high degree
of standardization (see Figure 8-4).
Figure 8-1. Some functions of a substation.

Substations
167
METAL-CLAD SWITCHGEAR
In some types of modern substations, the circuit breakers, discon-
necting switches, buses, measuring instruments, and relays associated
with the distribution circuits are enclosed in metal cabinets (see Figure
8-5), one for each circuit, providing fire and explosion protection be-
tween cabinets. The number of cabinets so mounted together vary with
the number of circuits involved. This makes a neater appearance, and
lessens the expense necessary to protect this equipment from the
weather. Also, these compartments are all prewired at the factory and
result in economy in such installations.

SUBSTATION EQUIPMENT
Transformers
Transformers for changing the voltage from that of the incoming
supply to that of the outgoing distribution feeders operate on the same
principle as do distribution transformers and are constructed in substan-
tially the same manner. They are usually filled with oil and are cooled
either by the surrounding atmosphere or by air blasts obtained from fans
trained on them. Some also circulate the oil for additional cooling.
Because of the high voltages imposed on the incoming side, there
is an elaborate electrical connection going through the cover which is
called a bushing.
Figure 8-3. A control center may operate several substations by remote
control.

Substations
169
The supply circuit is connected to the terminals of the primary
winding and the outgoing distribution feeders connected to the termi-
nals of the secondary winding. Substation transformers (see Figure 8-6)
are generally used to reduce the voltage to a lower value for distribution
and utilization. They can also be used in some situations to step up
voltage.
Regulators
The functioning of a regulator was previously discussed in the
section on line equipment. However, mention of its basic principle is
repeated here.
A regulator, shown in Figure 8-7, is really a transformer with a
variable ratio. When the outgoing voltage becomes too high or too low
for any reason, this apparatus automatically adjusts the ratio of transfor-
mation to bring the voltage back to the predetermined value. The adjust-
ment in ratio is accomplished by tapping the windings, varying the ratio
by connecting to the several taps. The unit is filled with oil and is cooled
Figure 8-4. A unit substation is conveniently installed.

170
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
much in the same manner as a transformer. A panel mounted in front of
the regulator contains the relays and the other equipment which control
the operation of the regulator.
Circuit Breakers
Oil circuit breakers (Figure 8-8) are used to interrupt circuits while
current is flowing through them. The making and breaking of contacts are
done under oil. As explained previously, the oil serves to quench the arc
when the circuit is opened. The operation of the breaker is very rapid
when opening. As with the transformer, the high voltage connections are
made through bushings. Circuit breakers of this type are usually ar-
ranged for remote electrical control from a suitably located switchboard.
Figure 8-5. Metal-clad switch-
gear. (a) Installing a circuit
breaker in an indoor substation
and (b) adjusting a control in an
outdoor substation.

Substations
171
Some circuit breakers have no oil, but put out the arc by a blast of
compressed air. These are called air circuit breakers. Another type en-
closes the contacts in a vacuum or a gas (sulfur hexafluoride, SF6) which
interrupts the conductive path of the arc.
Air-Break and Disconnect Switches
The operation of switches was discussed in detail in Chap. 4. Some
are mounted on an outdoor steel structure called a rack (see Figure 8-9),
while some may be mounted indoors on the switchboard panels. They
are usually installed on both sides of a piece of equipment, to effectively
de-energize it for maintenance.
The Switchboard
This is usually a panel or group of panels made of some insulat-
ing material on the front of which are mounted the various meters,
relays, controls, and indicators for the proper operation of transform-
Figure 8-6. A substation transformer.

172
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
ers, circuit breakers, and other equipment located in the substation.
The switchboard shown in Figure 8-10 contains all the equipment
necessary for controlling, protecting, and recording what goes on in a
substation.
Measuring Instruments
Various instruments are mounted on the switchboard to indicate
to the operator what voltage is impressed on the various incoming
and outgoing feeders as well as on various pieces of equipment, and
the current and power that flows through this equipment (see Figure
8-11). The instrument that measures voltage is called a voltmeter; that
which measures current is known as an ammeter; and that which mea-
sures power is called a wattmeter. These instruments may be either
indicating or recording. An indicating instrument indicates the quan-
tity at a particular moment, usually by position of the needle on the
scale. A recording instrument not only indicates the present value of

the quantity, but also records past values over a period of time. This
is usually done by tracing a line on a chart or graph.
Relays
A relay is a low-powered device used to activate a high-powered
device. In a transmission or distribution system, it is the job of relays to
give the tripping commands to the right circuit breakers.
Relays (Figure 8-12) protect the feeders and the equipment from
damage in the event of fault. In effect, these relays are measuring instru-
ments, similar to those in Figure 8-11, but equipped with auxiliary con-
tacts which operate when the quantities flowing through them exceed or
go below some predetermined value. When these contacts operate, they
in turn actuate mechanisms which usually operate switches or circuit
breakers, or in the case of the regulator, operate the motor to restore
voltage to the desired level. Modern relays employ electronic circuitry.

174
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
Bus Bars
Bus bar (bus, for short) is a term used for a main bar or conductor
carrying an electric current to which many connections may be made.
Buses are merely convenient means of connecting switches and
other equipment into various arrangements. The usual arrangement of
connections in most substations permits working on almost any piece of
equipment without interruption to incoming or outgoing feeders.

Detailed drawing of an air-break switch.

Substations
175
Some of the arrangements provide two buses to which the incom-
ing or outgoing feeders and the principal equipment may be connected.
One bus is usually called the main bus and the other auxiliary or transfer
bus. The main bus may have a more elaborate system of instruments,
relays, and so on, associated with it. The switches which permit feeders
or equipment to be connected to one bus or the other are usually called
selector or transfer switches. Bus bars come in a variety of sizes and
shapes, shown in Figure 8-13.
Substation Layout
The equipment and apparatus described may be connected to-
gether as shown in the typical layout of Figure 8-14(a). Description of

POLYMER (PLASTIC) INSULATION
In general, any form of porcelain insulation may be replaced with
polymer. Their electrical characteristics are about the same. Mechani-
cally they are also about the same, except porcelain must be used under
compression while polymer may be used both in tension and compres-
sion. Porcelain presently has an advantage in shedding rain, snow and
ice and in its cleansing effects; polymer may allow dirt, salt and other
pollutants to linger on its surface encouraging flashover, something that
can be overcome by adding additional polymer surfaces. Polymer’s
greatest advantage, however, is its comparatively light weight making
for labor savings; and essentially no breakage in handling. For detailed
comparison of the two insulations, refer to Appendix A, Insulation:
Porcelain vs. Polymer.

Chapter 9
Distribution Circuits,
Cogeneration and
Distributed Generation
Distribution circuits generally consist of two parts Figure 9-1: the
primary circuit operating at a relatively high pressure or voltage that
carries the electric supply to the area here it is to be used. The secondary
circuit receives the supply from the primary through transformers that
reduce its pressure or voltage to values low enough to deliver the prod-
uct safely to consumers Typical primary circuit voltages are 2400, 4160,
7620, 13800 and 23000 volts; secondary circuit voltages approximate 120
and 240 volts.
THE PRIMARY CIRCUIT
Should a fault occur on the circuit shown, Figure 9-2a, a large
current will flow to the fault that, if permitted to flow, will eventually
burn the conductor apart, ‘clearing’ the fault, but with hazards to the
public. Relays at the substation, however, will sense this large ‘fault’
current and operate to open the circuit breaker deenergizing the entire

circuit leaving consumers without power until repairs are made. This is
a basic circuit known as a ‘radial’ circuit.
LOOP CIRCUITS
To shorten the time of outage, the circuit may have a number of
sectionalizing switches as shown in Figure 9-2b, allowing parts to be
connected to other unfaulted circuits, restoring service to some consum-
ers. If the circuit is made into a loop, Figure 9-3a, with both ends con-
nected to its source through one or two circuit breakers, the fault can be
confined to the one section on which the fault occurred by opening the
sectionalizing switches on both ends of the faulted section and closing
the one or two breakers at the substation. In the closed loop type of
circuit, the fault current flowing to the fault is divided into two parts,
flowing in each side of the fault. This may sometime be too small to
achieve positive operation of the relays to open the breaker or breakers.
If the loop now be deliberately open at some point, the entire fault cur-
rent will flow through the branch between the fault and the substation
breaker, assuring its positive operation. The two ends of the circuit at the
open point are connected together through a circuit breaker set to close

automatically when one end is deenergized (or this may be accom-
plished manually with only a sectionalizing switch). All of the loop cir-
cuit will now be restored to service except the faulted section.
The sectionalizing switches may all be circuit breakers, Figure 9-3b,
opening and closing automatically. Since circuit breakers are expensive
compared to line switches, arrangements employing fewer breakers may
be employed, as shown in Figure 9-3c, with a lessened degree of reliabil-
ity for some consumers.
PRIMARY NETWORK
Where higher reliability is desired than from radial or loop circuits
(such as commercial and industrial complexes where the units may not
be spaced close together), the radial primary circuits are tied together

into a network. The network is supplied from a number of transformers
or substations supplied in turn by subtransmission and transmission
lines. Circuit breakers between the transformers and grid act as network
protectors to protect the network from faults on the incoming high volt-
age lines. Figure 9-4. The high cost of operating such a system in provid-
ing for load growth and the high potential hazard involved with the
enormous fault currents handled by the circuit breakers have led to their
replacement by low voltage secondary ‘spot’ networks, though some
primary networks may still be in operation.
SECONDARY CIRCUITS
The secondary circuits supplied through transformers from the
primary systems are also affected by faults on their associated primary

supply, whether from a radial, closed or open loop circuit.
Where additional expense may be justified to achieve a higher
degree of reliability, the secondary circuits of the several primary circuits
may be connected together to form a network, Figure 9-5 so that service
to any consumer will not be affected when a primary circuit, or any part
of it, may become deenergized for whatever reason. The secondary net-
work is connected through switches, called network protectors, through
transformers connected to their primary group supply circuits. These
switches, or protectors, are programmed to open when the current flow-
ing through them reverses direction. This, so that current flow from the
network may not supply fault current to a fault on any of the primary
supply circuits.

ground Reference Book)

Distribution Circuits, Cogeneration and Distributed Generation
189
The low voltage secondary network is also employed in serving
large individual loads requiring a high degree of reliability; these are
known as spot networks, Figure 9-6.
VOLTAGE REGULATION
The voltage variation at the consumer’s service will depend on the
current flowing from the source, the transmission and distribution sys-
tems right to the consumers service, The drop or difference in voltage
from when the consumer’s load is light on none to that when the con-
sumers load is heaviest is referred to as voltage regulation, Figure 9-7.
COGENERATION
As a measure to conserve fuel, while at the same time helping to
reduce the utility’s financial investment in generating facilities (also
sometimes difficult to locate because of environmental problems), gen-
erating facilities owned and operated by large consumers, may be con-
nected directly to the utility’s transmission and distribution lines,
usually as a substation-type installation. Not only must necessary pro-
tective devices be installed, but they are generally under the supervision
of the utility’s coordinator or system operator. The cogenerating con-
sumers sell their excess energy availability in the form of electricity to
the utility; in some states, this sale is mandated by law.
Strict control of such installations is necessary as they may present
a hazard to people working on the associated transmission and distribu-
tion lines. The line on which work is being done may be de-energized,
Figure 9-6. Typical spot network.

190
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
but, unless the strict control is maintained, accidental re-energizing of
the line may occur through the consumer closing the tying circuit
breaker in error, or substandard protective equipment may fail. The line
workers should take special precautions, usually by applying multiple
grounds to the line on which they are to work. A one-line diagram of
electric connections and protective devices is shown in Figure 9-8.
Cogeneration permits connection of consumer owned and oper-
ated generating facilities to the utility’s lines. Necessary protective de-
vices must be installed and the unit coordinated and controlled by the
utility. Cogeneration may present a hazard to workers performing work
on the line they may believe de-energized. Multiple grounds should be
placed on the line before work is begun.
PARALLELING THE SYSTEMS
Paralleling the consumer’s generation facilities with those of the
utility requires that additional protection equipment be installed at the
Figure 9-7. Allocation of voltage drops on distribution systems (Cour-
tesy Long Island Lighting Co.)

cogenerator’s facilities. The principal features of this additional protec-
tion include:
1.
Automatic synchronizing of the generator output with the utility,
2.
Relaying to prevent the closing of the circuit breaker to the utility
system until the cogenerator’s generator is open, for protection of
that generator,
3.
Relaying to open the circuit breaker to the utility system on loss of
power in the utility system,
4.
Relaying to open the circuit breaker to the utility system on a
ground fault on the utility system,
5.
Relaying to control the cogenerator’s generator circuit breaker to
provide generator overcurrent protection, phase current balance
protection, reverse power protection, under and over-frequency
protection, and under and overvoltage protection,
6.
Control of engine governor equipment for speed, generator phase
match, and generator load.

sumer cogeneration. (Courtesy Long Island Lighting Co.)

The electrical connections and indicated protection are shown on
the one-line diagram on Figure 9-8.
DISTRIBUTED GENERATION
A smaller version of cogeneration, known as distributed genera-
tion, was developed to be connected to the distribution systems at stra-
tegic points. These mainly consisted of small units, generally driven by
small gas turbines, but may include wind, solar, fuel cell, and other
experimental units; these may be both utility and consumer owned.
These units, and some cogeneration units, are not usually competitive
with utility owned larger units that have the advantage of scale.
Some cogeneration and distributed generation units may impact
negatively on the safety of operations. Although standards for the selec-
tion, installation, and maintenance of equipment to connect and discon-
nect these units from the system to which they supply electric energy are
furnished the consumer by the utility, these standards are not always
followed, particularly those related to maintenance. This constitutes a
hazard to persons who may be working on the systems; believing them
to be deenergized, they may be the victims of an improper, unan-
nounced, connection, energizing the systems to which they are con-
nected. Similarly, should a fault develop on the utility system to which
they are connected and the equipment fail to disconnect their generation
from the system, overloads, fires and explosions may occur. Further,
while they are under the supervision of the System Operator, they tend
to dilute his attention to other events.
REMOTE METER READING AND DEMAND CONTROL
Electronic developments that have made e-mail (and the internet)
inexpensive and universal means of communication have also made
practical the remote reading of consumer’s meters. Periodic inquiry
automatically sent to each consumer identifies their meter and records
the dial consumption and other data, transmitting it to the computer
center where it may be automatically processed, producing the bill sent
to the consumer.
In some cases, usually commercial and industrial consumers,

193
where it is desired to hold down their demands by arranging their loads
not to coincide, and where practical to be scheduled for off peak hours
(usually evening and early morning hours), the same means of commu-
nication is used to operate relays and switches to accomplish this pur-
pose, often employing the same meter reading facilities.

Chapter 10
Essentials of Electricity
ELECTRICITY
When “electricity,” is mentioned, it reflects broadly a form of en-
ergy that can perform many different kinds of work, the end result of
which may be as varied as are the users of heat, light, mechanical, and
chemical energy.
Electric current in a wire, on the other hand, identifies electricity in
motion in a wire, just as the reference to “flow of water in a pipe” im-
mediately identifies water in motion in a pipe (see Figure 10-1). Al-
though comparison is made between electric current and water flow, the
impression should not be had that electricity is a weightless fluid.
Strange as it may seem, “electric current” in a wire is the simultaneous
motion in the same direction of innumerable extremely small “particles
of electricity” called electrons.
These electrons are already in the wire, but their normal motion is
random, that is, as many are moving in one direction as in the other, so
that there is no net movement in one direction, hence, there is no electric
current.
In fact, when “electric pressure,” which is referred to as “voltage,”
is applied, all that is done is to change the random motion of the elec-
trons in the wire to a directed or controlled motion. (The correct meaning
of voltage is level of electric pressure). By directed motion, what is meant
is that all of the electrons move in the same direction.
Conductors and Insulators
The basis of all the concepts in the field of electricity is the electron
theory. This states that all matter is composed of tiny units called atoms.
These in turn subdivide into even smaller particles called protons, elec-
trons, and neutrons. An atom is illustrated in Figure 10-2(a) as having a
nucleus containing neutrons (having no electrical charge), and protons

196

(having a positive electric charge). Around this nucleus spin electrons
(having a negative electric charge) in various orbits. The electrons in the
outer orbit of the atom may leave that orbit and move from atom to
atom in a substance. These electrons are called free electrons, and nor-
mally move in all different directions. However, when a voltage is ap-
plied across a wire, the free electrons flow in one general direction,
called the current flow. Materials having many free electrons are called
conductors, and for a given amount of voltage will provide a large cur-
rent flow.
Materials having few free electrons [see Figure 10-2(b)] are called
insulators and for a given amount of voltage will provide little or no
current flow. Typical good electrical conductors are copper and alumi-
num; good insulators are mica, porcelain, glass, and wood.
Resistance
Resistance is essentially the opposition offered by a substance to the
flow of electric current. Remember that a conductor is made of a mate-
rial whose atomic structure has a large number of free electrons. Because
of the greater number of free electrons in their atomic structure, some
conductors allow electric current to flow more readily than others. Re-
Figure 10-1. Comparison of water and electric currents. (a) Flow iden-
tifies water in motion. (b) Electric current identifies electricity in
motion.

sistance in a conductor is similar to friction in a pipe. A pipe with a
smooth inside surface conducts water with little loss of pressure or hin-
drance to the flow. But if the pipe is rough inside, the pressure and flow
are reduced. Similarly, a good conductor allows electricity to flow with
little opposition or resistance and with a small loss of electrical pressure
or voltage. A poor conductor offers a large resistance to electric current
and this causes a large loss of pressure or voltage. Just as the length and
cross section of the pipe affect the flow of water so it is with conductors
of electric current: the greater the length, the greater the resistance; the
greater the cross-sectional area, the smaller the resistance (see Figure 10-
3). Additionally the material of which the conductor is made also affects
the resistance. The energy used in overcoming resistance is converted
into heat that is why some conductors are found to be warm when
touched.
The Electric Circuit
Electric current flows only when wires or metallic conductors form

protons and neutrons around which planetary electrons revolve in
orbits. (b) Comparison of conductor and insulator.

a closed path. These closed paths can be arranged in several ways—in
series, parallel, and series-parallel—and are referred to as circuits, or
electric circuits. A series circuit [see Figure 10-4(a)] is formed by connect-
ing a storage battery to a number of lamps connected as shown. If for
any reason one of the lamps goes out, there is no longer a closed electric
circuit and current will not flow.
If the same storage battery is taken and the lamps are connected
across each other, a parallel circuit is formed, shown in Figure 10-4(b). In
this arrangement should any one lamp go out, the remainder will re-
main lit. By combining lamps in series with those in parallel the series-
parallel circuit is formed, shown in Figure 10-4(c). In this circuit, the
series section has all the characteristics of the series circuit, and the
parallel section has the characteristics of the parallel circuit.
Difference of Pressure—
Difference of Potential-Voltage
In a water system that is made up of a water pump, water pipes,
and a valve (to turn the water on and off), water will flow only when the
pump is working. A pump enables a flow of water by virtue of the fact
that it creates a difference in pressure, causing the water to flow from a
point in the pipe at high pressure to a point in the pipe at a lower pres-
Figure 10-3. Resistance.

Essentials of Electricity
199
sure. Thus, with the pump rotating and with the valve of the water pipe
turned on, a steady flow of water will be obtained. If the pump rotates
and if the valve is in the “off” position, a relatively large amount of
pressure is built up near the valve; but no water will flow.
The water system just discussed can be compared to an electric
system (see Figure 10-5), replacing the pump with a generator, the pipe
with a conductor, and the valve with a switch to turn the electric current
on and off. By analogy, to obtain current flow in the electrical system, the
generator must be rotating and the switch must be placed in the on
position. Rotating the generator creates a “difference of electric pres-
sure,” also called difference of potential, at the terminals of the genera-
Figure 10-4. Lamps maybe connected to form, (a) a series circuit, (b) a
parallel circuit, and (c) a series-parallel circuit.

200
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
tor. This is the difference of electric pressure which will cause the elec-
trons in the conductor to move, that is, cause the current to flow in a
conductor. If the switch is placed in the off position, while the generator
is rotating, electric pressure or potential will be built up near the switch
terminals but no electric current will flow.
Electrical Quantities
Resistance, the opposition offered by a substance to the flow of
current; current, the flow of electrons through a conductor; and voltage,
the electrical pressure that forces current to flow through a resistance, all
have been discussed. These can now be discussed further regarding the
quantities or units in which each are measured. Resistance is measured
in ohms, current in amperes, and voltage in volts. These may be tied to-
gether with the basic statement that one ampere of current will flow
through a resistance of one ohm when a voltage of one volt is applied
across the resistance [see Figure 10-6(a)].
The unit of electrical power is the watt, with 746 watts considered
equal to one horsepower. The watt is equal to the current in a dc circuit
multiplied by the voltage applied to the circuit. Thus, if 100 amperes
flow in a circuit in which there is a 10-volt battery, the battery is supply-
ing 1000 watts of power. Another way of saying this is that the load is
consuming 1000 watts.
Electrical power consumed in the home or industry is measured in
Figure 10-5. Voltage is a measure of difference of potential.

Essentials of Electricity
201
terms of watt-hours. This is equal to the power consumed by a circuit
multiplied by the number of hours in which it was consumed. The in-
strument that measures this is called a watt-hour meter, and electric bills
are calculated on the basis of readings made on this meter [Figure 10-
6(b)].
While the basic units used in the measurement of electrical quan-
tities are the ohm, volt, ampere, and watt, these units often appear in
such large quantities that it would be inconvenient to speak in terms of
the basic unit. For example, approximately 6 volts may be obtained from
a storage battery, and 117 volts from a house electrical receptacle. How-
ever, when discussing high-voltage transformers and transmission lines
terms of 10,000 V, 50,000 V, and sometimes voltage in excess of 100,000
V are used. To simplify this, the prefix “kilo” is generally used for large
quantities. This indicates that the number should be multiplied by 1000.
Thus, a 10-kilovolt (kV) transformer is rated as being capable of han-
dling 10,000 V; similarly, 60 kV, 60 kW, and so on. In general notation,
abbreviate kilo and simply refer to “k,” hence, kV, kW, and so on.
Another commonly used prefix is the term “mega” or “meg”
which indicates that the number associated with it must be multiplied
by 1,000,000. In general use this term is too large to be associated with
either current or voltage, but is often used in connection with insulators
in such expressions as 1 megohm or 50 megohms.

××××× 1 ampere 1 watt. (b) In 1000 hours, a watt-hour meter would read 1
kilowatt hour.

202
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
Two other prefixes sometimes used are “mil” and “milli” for one
thousandth of some quantity, and “micro” for one millionth of some
quantity. Examples of these are millivolt for 0.001 V and microvolt (μV)
for 0. 000001 V. Actually, these various prefixes represent nothing more
than a “shorthand” notation; they make the task of discussing very large
or very small quantities easier. Figure 10-7 illustrates the shorthand
notations.
Ohm’s Law
The relationship of current, voltage, and resistance must be consid-
ered in every electric circuit. Direct current will flow only in a closed
circuit, one which provides a continuous conducting path from the nega-
tive to the positive terminal of the voltage source. The way the electro-
motive force (emf), E, is distributed through the circuit and the
relationships of voltage, current, and resistance, are contained in Ohm’s
law, which states that the current in an electric circuit is directly proportional
to the voltage and inversely proportional to the resistance.
This law may be expressed by the equation
1.
I = E/R or current equals the voltage divided by the resistance.
From which equations 2 and 3 may be derived:
2.
R = E/I, or resistance equals the voltage divided by the cur-
rent.
Figure 10-7. Shorthand notation.

Essentials of Electricity
203
3.
E = IR, or the voltage is equal to the product of the current
times the resistance.
For example: with a battery voltage of 12 volts (shown on the
voltmeter) and a resistance of 3 ohms, the amperes may be found as
follows:
I = E/R
I = 12 volts ÷ 3 ohms
I = 4 amperes or 4 A
Figure 10-8 illustrates pictorially the relationships between E, I, and R.
Alternating Current
So far, we have discussed the transfer of energy from one point to
another point, both through the medium of water and electricity circu-
lating continuously in a circuit in one direction.
Now, consider what happens when the pump in Figure 10-9 is
actuated from an outside source of power. Water in pipe B will be
pushed in one direction causing a flow of water or current in that direc-
tion. Assuming the valve is open, the water will push the piston in the
water motor in the same direction. Now, as the piston of the pump
moves in the opposite direction, water in pipe A will be pushed, causing
a flow of water in the direction of the water motor. The water will push
the piston of the water motor in the direction opposite to that previously
Figure 10-8. Pictorial representation of E, I, R, and Ohm’s Law.

204
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
moved. Thus, an oscillating, or to-and-fro, motion is transmitted from
one end of the circuit to the other. The piston water motor can then be
used to drive machinery.
It is seen, therefore, that complete circulation of water or electricity
is not necessary to transmit energy from one point to another. In this
method, currents alternate their direction periodically, first flowing in
one direction in a pipe, and then in the other. In electric circuits, this is
called an alternating current (ac) system to distinguish it from the con-
tinuous or direct current (dc) system. Utility companies almost always
use alternating current for their distribution systems.
Power in an AC Circuit
To obtain the power in a dc circuit, the voltage in volts is simply
multiplied by the current in amperes. Thus, the power in watts is ob-
tained. The electrical energy in the dc circuit is transformed into heat at
the rate of P = 12R, where P is power, I is current in amperes, and R is
resistance in ohms.
The power consumed in the ac circuit is the average of all the
values of instantaneous power or the rate at which electrical energy is
transformed into heat or mechanical energy for a complete cycle. To find
the power value, the instantaneous voltage and current value are mul-
Figure 10-9. Water analogy of alternating current. A pumping system
in which the energy of motion is transferred by water.

Essentials of Electricity
205
tiplied and the power value for each instant is plotted on a graph. The
power curve obtained shows the value of instantaneous power as a
function of time. The average of the instantaneous power obtained from
the curve is the average power absorbed in the circuit. In an ac circuit
which contains resistance only, the average power is equal to I, the
maximum instantaneous power. The average power value of such a cir-
cuit is equal to the product E effective × I effective. (E is voltage and I
is current.)
The effective value of ac is that value that produces the same
amount of work as an equivalent amount of dc. When the ac circuit
contains resistance only, the product E effective × I effective (the power
in watts) is the same as in the corresponding dc circuit. In ac circuits
which contain inductance and capacitance, the product E effective × I
effective is not equal to the power in watts but is called the apparent
power expressed in volt-amperes. The power in watts for these circuits
is equal to 12R or E2/R. This is also called the true power of the circuit,
and it is absorbed in the resistive part of the circuit.
The ratio between the true power in watts and the apparent power
in volt-amperes is called the power factor of the circuit. For the theoretical
circuit shown in Figure 10-10, containing resistance only, the power fac-
tor is equal to 1. Practically, the power factor is always less than 1 be-
cause all circuits contain inductance and capacitance in some degree. It
is in the interest of the utility company and of the consumer to maintain
a power factor as close to 1 as possible.
Electromagnetic Induction—Alternating Current
If a conductor which is part of a closed circuit is moved through a

magnetic field, an electric current will flow in the conductor. The current
results from what is called the induced electromotive force (emf). But this
happens only if the directions (1) of the current, (2) of the magnetic field,
and (3) of the motion are at right angles to each other.
If a loop of wire as illustrated in Figure 10-11 is rotated at uniform
speed in a magnetic field, a voltage is induced in the conductor that
makes up the loop. By measuring the voltage for different positions of
the loops and recording the angular position of the loop, the waveform
of the induced voltage is obtained. This waveform is called a sine wave.
Note that the instantaneous values of the voltage change continuously
from zero to maximum, from maximum back to zero, from zero to a
minimum, and from the minimum back to zero, thus completing one
cycle. The maximum, or the minimum of the voltage wave, is called the
amplitude of the voltage, and the number of cycles per second the fre-
quency of the wave. The part of the curve from zero-to-maximum back to
zero is called an alternation. Such a waveform is an example of the form
of voltage and current in the alternating current circuit.
Magnetic Field Around a Conductor
When an electric current flows through a conductor, a magnetic

field is created. The lines of force of this magnetic field form concentric
circles around the conductor (see Figure 10-12) with the strength of this
field depending on the amount of current flowing in the conductor. If
the conductor is wound in a coil formed of many turns as shown in
Figure 10-13, there will be an increase in the number of the lines of force
because now each turn of the coil aids every other turn in strengthening
the magnetic field.
An increase in the lines of force, or strength of the magnetic field,
may be further obtained by winding the coil around a closed iron core
(see Figure 10-14). This occurs because the iron core provides an easy
path (compared to air) for the lines of force of the magnetic field.

field.

208
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
Polyphase Voltage
The generation of a sine wave just described was the result of ro-
tating a coil of wire in the magnetic field set up by two poles of a mag-
net. In many cases it is more efficient and more economical to generate
a voltage by using many coils, each electrically insulated from each
other. When this is done, each coil produces a sine wave and the output
of such a generator appears as a series of sine waves each slightly dis-
placed. A sine wave may be divided into 360 degrees, and called a com-
plete cycle. Using this idea, if three coils are rotated in the magnetic
field, and if they are separated by 120 degrees, the sine-wave output will
be a series of sine waves each separated by 120 degrees [see Figure 10-
15(a) and 10-15(b)]. This is called three-phase voltage as against single-
phase voltage when a single coil is used.
In practice, the use of single or three-phase voltage is a matter of
Figure 10-15. Polyphase voltage. (a) Simplified diagram of 3-phase
generator and (b) output waveform of 3-phase generator.

considerable importance. However, in the basic discussion of the equip-
ment and concepts involved in power distribution, the phase of the
generated electricity is of no great importance, except on a few occasions
where the reader will find it mentioned.
Induced Voltages
If another coil is wound on the same iron core, the lines of force of
the magnetic field created by the current flowing through the first coil
cut through the turns of the second coil. The closer the two coils are, the
greater will be the number of lines of force that intercept the turns of the
second coil. If a voltmeter is connected across the second coil the meter
will show a deflection every time the switch is closed or opened. The
voltage that is measured in this second coil is called an induced voltage
(see Figure 10-16).
From this is derived a very important law of electricity: Whenever
magnetic lines of force cut through a conductor, a voltage is generated or in-
duced in that conductor. Since there is no change in the current flow while
the switch is closed or open, no voltage is induced into the second coil
during this time. Suppose the dc battery is replaced with a source of
alternating current. This will produce a current flow that is continually
changing in value, which in turn produces a continuously changing
magnetic field. The voltmeter will now read a continuous alternating
current. There are now the ingredients of a device called a transformer.
The coil to which the ac voltage is applied is called the primary, with the
second coil on the core called the secondary.
HOW THE TRANSFORMER WORKS
The Transformer
Fundamentally, as shown in Figure 10-17, a transformer consists of
two or more windings placed on a common iron core. All transformers
have a primary winding and one or more secondary windings. The core
of a transformer is made of laminated iron and links the coils of insu-
lated wire that are wound around it. There is no electrical connection
between the primary and the secondary; the coupling between them is
through magnetic fields. This is why transformers are sometimes used
for no other purpose than to isolate one circuit from another electrically.
When this is done, the transformer used for this purpose is called an

210
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
isolating transformer.
The winding that is connected to the source of power is called the
primary, and the winding connected to the load is called the secondary.
The essential function of the conventional power transformer is to trans-
fer power from the primary to the secondary with a minimum of losses.
In the process of transferring energy from primary to secondary, the
voltage delivered to the load may be made higher or lower than the
primary voltage. The load may be some household appliance, an indus-
trial electrical device, or even another transformer.
Step-Up and Step-Down Transformers
Transformers are wound to be as close to 100 percent efficient as
possible. That is, all the power in the primary should be transferred to
the secondary. This is done by selecting the proper core material, wind-
ing the primary and secondary close to each other, and a number of
other careful designs.
Thus, assuming 100 percent transformer efficiency, it can then be
Figure 10-16. Induced voltage. (a) When switch is opened or closed,
the voltmeter will deflect. (b) Voltmeter reads continuous ac voltage.

Essentials of Electricity
211
assumed that the relationship between the primary and secondary volt-
ages will be the same as the relationship between their turns. If the sec-
ondary has more turns than the primary it can be said that the
transformer is operating as a step-up transformer; if the secondary has
fewer turns than the primary we say that the transformer is operating as
a step-down transformer.
Figure 10-18 gives a representation of an autotransformer together
with a conventional transformer. The autotransformer is somewhat dif-
ferent from the conventional transformer in that portions of the primary
and secondary are common, or make use of the same turns. However, like
all other transformers, the autotransformer does have the basic primary
and secondary windings.
Turns Ratio
Whether a transformer is of a step-up or step-down type the power
in the primary is equal to the power in the secondary. Thus, if the load
draws 1000 watts, the product of voltage and current in the primary is
also equal to 1000 watts. Another important principle is the fact that the
primary and secondary voltages are in the same ratio as their turns. If
the secondary has twice the turns of the primary, the secondary voltage
will be twice as great as that of the primary. Figure 10-19 illustrates the
significance of turns ratio.
Figure 10-17. The basic transformer.

212
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
Transformer Rating
The nameplate on a transformer (see Figure 10-20) gives all the
pertinent information required for the proper operation and mainte-
nance of the unit. The capacity of a transformer (or any other piece of
electrical equipment) is limited by the permissible temperature rise dur-
ing operation. The heat generated in a transformer is determined by
both the current and the voltage. Of more importance is the kilovolt-
ampere rating of the transformer. This indicates the maximum power on
which the transformer is designed to operate under normal conditions
(when the current and voltage are “in phase”). Other information gen-
erally given is the phase (single-phase, three-phase, etc.), the primary
and secondary voltages, frequency, the permitted temperature rise, and
the cooling requirements—which include the number of gallons of fluid
that the cooling tanks may hold. Primary and secondary currents may be
stated at full load.
Depending on the type of transformer and its special applications,
there may be other types of identifications for various gages, tempera-
ture indication, pressure, drains, and various valves.
Thus, it can be seen that while the transformer consists primarily

of a primary and a secondary winding, there are many other points to

Methods of Transformer Cooling

prevent excessive rise of temperature and injury to the insulation about
the conductors. The cooling method used must be capable of maintain-
ing a sufficiently low average temperature. It must also be capable of
preventing an excessive temperature rise in any portion of the trans-
former, and the formation of “hot spots.” This is accomplished, for ex-
ample, by submerging the core and coils of the transformer in oil, and
allowing free circulation for the oil [Figure 10-21(a)]. Sometimes, for
reasons of safety, the use of oil as a cooling agent is prohibited. (Oil can
be a fire hazard.) In these situations, special fluids, known as “askarels”
can be used in place of oil. However, when using these substitutes, the
varnishes which are generally applied to the insulation of the coils must
be chosen carefully. For indoor use, in clean, dry locations, open dry-
type air cooling can be used [see Figure 10-21 (b)]. For outdoor or indoor,
use, a sealed dry type can be obtained.
Some transformers are cooled by other means: (a) by forced air or
air blast, (b) by a combination of forced oil and forced air, and (c) in
some special applications, by water cooling.

Insulation: Porcelain vs. Polymer
217

Appendix A
Insulation:
Porcelain Vs. Polymer
For many years, porcelain for insulation purposes on lines and
equipment has exercised a virtual monopoly. It was perhaps inevitable
that plastics, successful as insulation for conductors since the early
1950’s, should supplant porcelain as insulation for other applications in
the electric power field.
The positive properties of porcelain are chiefly its high insulation
value and its great strength under compression. Its negative features are
its weight (low strength to weight ratio) and its tendency to fragmenta-
tion under stress. Much of the strength of a porcelain insulator is con-
sumed in supporting its own weight. Figure A-1a&b.
In contrast, the so-called polymer not only has equally high insu-
lation value, but acceptable strength under both compression and ten-
sion. It also has better water and sleet shedding properties, hence
handles contamination more effectively, and is less prone to damage or
destruction from vandalism. It is very much lighter in weight than por-
celain (better strength to weight ratio), therefore more easily handled.
Figure A-2, Table A-1.
Economically, costs of porcelain and polymer materials are very
competitive, but the handling factors very much favor the polymer.
Polymer insulation is generally associated with a mechanically
stronger insulation, such as high strength fiberglass. The fiberglass insu-
lation serves as an internal structure around which the polymer insula-
tion is attached, usually in the form (and function) of petticoats
(sometimes also referred to as bands, water shedders; but for compari-
son purposes, however, here only the term petticoat will be used). The
insulation value of the Polymer petticoats is equal to or greater than that
of the fiberglass to which it is attached.
The internal fiberglass structure may take the form of a rod (or
shaft), a tube, cylinder, or other shape. It has a high comparable com-

pression strength as a solid and its tensile strength, equally high, is fur-
ther improved by stranding and aligning around a fiber center. The
polymer petticoats are installed around the fiberglass insulation and
sealed to prevent moisture or contamination from entering between the
petticoats and fiberglass; Figure A-3. The metal fittings at either end are
crimped directly to the fiberglass, developing a high percentage of the
inherent strength of the fiberglass. It should be noted that fiberglass with
an elastometric (plastic) covering has been used for insulation purposes
since the early 1920’s.
The polymer petticoats serve the same function as the petticoats
associated with porcelain insulators, that of providing a greater path for
electric leakage between the energized conductors (terminals, buses,

etc.) and the supporting structures. In inclement weather, this involves
the shedding of rain water or sleet as readily as possible to maintain as
much as possible the electric resistance between the energized element
and the supporting structure, so that the leakage of electrical current
between these two points be kept as low as possible to prevent flashover
and possible damage or destruction of the insulator. Tables A-2a&b.
When the insulator becomes wet, and especially in a contaminated
environment, leakage currents begin to flow on the surface; if the cur-
rent becomes high enough, an external flashover takes place. The rate at
which the insulation dries is critical. The relationship between the outer
petticoat diameter and the core is known as the form factor. The leak-
age current generates heat (I2R) on the surface of the insulator (eddy
currents). In addition to the effects of the leakage current, the rate at
which the petticoat insulation will dry depends on a number of factors.
Starting with its contamination before becoming wet, the temperature
and humidity of the atmosphere and wind velocity following the cessa-
tion of the inclement weather. In areas where extreme contamination
may occur (such as some industrial areas or proximity to ocean salt
spray), the polymer petticoats may be alternated in different sizes, Fig-
ure A-4, to obtain greater distance between the outer edges of the pet-
ticoats across which flashover might occur. When dry, the leakage
current (approximately) ceases and the line voltage is supported across
dry petticoats, preventing flashover of the insulator. It is obviously im-
practical to design and manufacture comparable porcelain insulators as
thin as polymers and having the same form factor. Table A-3.

sulation and sealing (Courtesy Hubbell Power Systems).

In addition, in porcelain insulators, the active insulating segment is
usually small and, when subjected to lightning or surge voltage stresses,
may be punctured. In subsequent similar circumstances, it may break-
down completely, not only causing flashover between the energized el-
ement and the supporting structure, but may explode causing porcelain
fragmentation in the process; the one-piece fiberglass insulator will not
experience puncture.
The polymer suitable for high voltage application consists of these
materials:
1.
Ethylene Propylene Monomer (EPM)
2.
Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM)
3.
Silicone Rubber (SR)
Both EPM and EPDM, jointly referred to as EP, are known for their
inherent resistance to tracking and corrosion, and for their physical
properties, SR offers good contamination performance and resistance to
Ultra Violet (UV) sun rays. The result of combining these is a product
that achieves the water repellent feature (hydrophobic) of silicone and
the electromechanical advantages of EP rubber.

Tested using the 5-hour uniform slurry test procedure. This test consists of applying a uniform coating of standard
400 ohm-cm slurry to the test arrester. Within 30 seconds, MCOV is applied for 15 minutes, during which time the
surface leakage currents cause the surface to dry. Slurry applications are repeated for a total of 20 test cycles. After
the 20th test cycle, MCOV is applied to the arrester for 30 to 60 minutes to demonstrate thermal stability Surface
leakage currents were measured at the end of the 5th, 10th, 15th and 20th test cycles.

Electrical Power Distribution Systems
Different polymer materials may be combined to produce a poly-
mer with special properties; for example, a silicone EPDM is highly re-
sistant to industrial type pollution and ocean salt.
The advantageous strength to weight ratio of polymer as compared
to porcelain makes possible lighter structures and overall costs as well as
permitting more compact designs, resulting in narrower right-of-way
requirements and smaller station layouts. The reduction in handling,
shipping, packaging, storage, preparation and assembly, all with less
breakage, are obvious—these, in addition
to the superior electromechanical perfor-
mance.
Fiberglass insulation with its poly-
mer petticoats is supplanting porcelain in
bushings associated with transformers,
voltage regulators, capacitors, switchgear,
circuit breakers, bus supports, instrument
transformers, lightning or surge arresters,
and other applications. The metallic rod
or conductor inside the bushing body
may be inserted in a fiberglass tube and
sealed to prevent moisture or contamina-
tion entering between the conductor and
the fiberglass tube around which the
polymer petticoats are attached. More of-
ten, the fiberglass insulation is molded
around the conductor, and the polymer
petticoats attached in a similar fashion as
in insulators. Figure A-5.
Lightning or surge arrester elements
are enclosed in an insulated casing. Under
severe operating conditions, or as a result
of multiple operations, the pressure gen-
erated within the casing may rise to the
point where pressure relief ratings are ex-
ceeded. The arrester then may fail, with or

ling fragments of the casing as well as the internal components, causing
possible injury to personnel and damage to surrounding structures. The
action represents a race between pressures building up within the casing
and an arcing or flashover outside the casing. The ‘length’ of the casing
of the arrester limits its ability to vent safely. The use of polymer insu-
lation for the casing permits puncturing to occur, without the fragmen-
tation that may accompany breakdown and failure of porcelain.
Summarizing, the advantages of polymers over porcelain include:
•
Polymer insulation offers benefits in shedding rain water or sleet,
particularly in contaminated environments.
•
Polymer products weigh significantly less than their porcelain
counterparts, particularly line insulators, resulting in cost savings
in structures, construction and installation costs. Table A-4.

Polymer insulators and surge arresters are resistant to damage re-
sulting from installation and to damage from vandalism. The lack
of flying fragments when a polymer insulator is shot deprives the
vandal from his satisfaction with a spectacular event and should
discourage insulators as convenient targets.
•
Polymer arresters allow for multiple operations (such as may result
from station circuit reclosings), without violently failing. Figure A-

Polymer insulators permit increased conductor (and static wire)
line tensions, resulting in lower construction designs by permitting
longer spans, fewer towers or lower tower heights.

Polymer one-piece insulators, lacking the flexibility of porcelain

to produce a tendency to dampen galloping lines.
Although polymer insulation has become increasingly utilized
over the past several decades, there are literally millions of porcelain
insulated installations in this country alone; economics does not permit
their wholesale replacement. Advantage is taken of maintenance and re-
construction of such facilities to make the change to polymers.

STREET LIGHTING
Besides lighting homes, factories, and offices, it is the job of the util-
ity company or local governing bodies to illuminate the streets and high-
ways of the area it serves. In performing this job, as in every other, the aim
is to supply the best possible service for the least possible expense.
The first and most important purpose of street lighting is safety-
safety from traffic accidents and crime. Street lighting also adds consid-
erably to the beauty of a town street or a highway. All in all, good street
lighting spells comfort and convenience for the residents of a commu-
nity (Figure B-1) or the users of highways.
The factors which the utility company must consider in planning a
streetlighting system are many.
1.
How much light is needed.
2.
Types of structures along the road: homes or businesses.
3.
Design of the road.
4.
How much traffic passes by.
5.
Crime potential.
Studies have proved conclusively that good street lighting consid-
erably reduces traffic accidents and crime rates. It also improves retail
business.
The Street-Lighting Fixture
The sight of a street or highway lighting fixture is certainly famil-
iar. Generally, a street light consists of a post (wood, iron, aluminum, or

234
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
concrete) (see Figure B-2), with an attached fixture which supports a
lamp. Many times, the lamp is enclosed in diffusing glassware. This is
to make for proper distribution of light. Here again, the utility company
must consider safety. It is good lighting practice to prevent any glare
effect. That’s why these globes or glass-paneled fixtures are so impor-
tant. The height and brilliancy of the unit, as well as the spacing between
the units determine the intensity of illumination which will be pro-
duced. This will vary, of course, at different points between the lighting
units. Many recent types of fixtures also contain a photocell, which is
discussed later.
Street-Lighting Patterns
A street-lighting engineer can make light diffuse at any angle, de-
pending on the area to be illuminated, the spacing between the units,
and the mounting height of the luminaire. Although most of the light is
directed to the road, there are many situations where the sidewalk must
be comparably illuminated. The pendant (or hanging) type luminaire is
most frequently used. The effectiveness of a pendant luminaire is con-
siderable since it is usually hung right over the road.
Figure B-1. The purpose of street lighting is safety from traffic acci-
dents and crime.

Street Lighting
235
There are actually five different patterns of street-light diffusion
shown in Figure B-3, differentiated by the degree of the diffusion angle.
Type I consists simply of a light hung at an intersection. Type II is
mounted at the side of a street and diffuses light at a 65 degree angle.
Type III is also mounted on the side of a street; but in this case light is
diffused at a 45 degree angle. In the asymmetric pattern (Type IV), light
is diffused on both sides at a 90 degree angle and all the way across the
street. The idea of the symmetric pattern (Type V) is to light up the
whole intersection, roads, and corners alike.
MULTIPLE STREET LIGHTING
Street-Lighting Circuits
As will be explained again later in this book, the two fundamental
Figure B-2. Street-lighting fixtures. (a) An upright street light and (b)
a pendant street light.

236
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
types of electric circuit are the multiple or parallel circuit and the series
circuit. Other types are a combination of these. Both of these types of
circuits are used for street lighting, and they are commonly referred to
as multiple lighting and series lighting.
The series street-light system is rapidly being replaced by the
multiple system with photoelectric control of individual or groups of
street lights. However, as there are many of these series street-light
systems still in existence, a description of this system will be included
here.
Multiple Lighting
A parallel or multiple circuit may be likened to the rungs of a
ladder as shown in Figure B-4(a). The rungs would represent the de-
vices connected in the circuit and the sides represent the circuits ap-
plying a common pressure. Consider the water system shown in
Figure B-4(b). The water is pumped from a source where its pressure
is raised to give it the necessary pressure. When the valve is opened,
the pump raises the pressure and sends it into the top pipe. When
Figure B-3. Street-lighting patterns.

Street Lighting
237
the valve associated with the first waterwheel is opened, the water
under pressure turns the waterwheel which does some work. The
water is collected and returned through the lower pipe, where it is
returned to the pump, again raised in pressure, and so on around
again.
The same action takes place when the valve associated with the
second waterwheel is opened, the third waterwheel, and so on. In this
type water system, the pressure applied to each of the several
waterwheels is the same, but the current of water flowing through the
pump is the sum of the currents flowing through each of the
waterwheels.
Similarly, a multiple street-lighting system consists of a group of
lamps in multiple connected to the secondary street mains through re-
lays or time switches. The relay or time switch may be connected to

SERIES STREET LIGHTING
Series Lighting
To understand the series electric circuit, consider the water system
shown in Figure B-6. The water is pumped from a source where its
pressure is raised to give it the necessary force to travel around the
system shown. When the valve is turned on, the water flows through the
top pipe to spigot No. 1 where the outrushing water turns the
waterwheel and does some work. As it falls into the collecting reservoir,
the pressure of the water is reduced by the amount of pressure necessary
to turn the first waterwheel. The remaining pressure pushes the water
on to the second waterwheel where the same action is repeated. And
again, the action is repeated to the third, and so on, until finally, the
water pressure is all used up and the pressure drops to zero. The water
then is collected in the bottom pipe, where the pump picks it up and the
cycle is repeated. In this system, the pressure lost in turning each of the

ment.

several waterwheels may be different, but the sum of these pressure-
losses totals up to the pressure applied by the pump. The current of
water is the same through each waterwheel.
Similarly, the series street-lighting circuit is operated by connecting
the lamps in series. Since the lamps are connected in series, the same
current passes through each lamp, even though the brilliance of light
output for the various lamps may be different. It is obvious that the
more lamps connected in the circuit, the greater the applied pressure or
voltage will have to be to maintain a fixed current flowing through the
circuit; similarly, the fewer lamps, the less the voltage.
All the parts of a series circuit are connected in succession, like
beads on a string, so that whatever current passes through one of the
parts passes through all of the parts. A typical series circuit is illustrated
in Figure B-7.
The amount of light produced by such a series light depends on
the length of the filament; the thickness for different light output lamps
is the same. The greater amount of light required, the longer will be the
filament. Lamps for series circuits are usually rated in lumens or “candle-
power,” that is units of light output rather than in units of electrical
input. For larger size lamps, thicker size filaments are used which are
designed for operation at 15 and 20 amperes. Ordinary lamps are de-
signed for optimum operation when 6.6 amperes flow through them.
Figure B-6. Water analogy of a series circuit.

Electrical Power Distribution Systems
Film Disc Cutout
In the water circuit illustrated, it should be noted that if there is a
break in any of the connecting pipes, the water will drain out and the
action stops. A closed valve causes the same halt in action.
Similarly, if one of the lamps in a series circuit were to burn out, the
circuit would be interrupted and all the lights would go out. If the cur-
rent were to be allowed to flow into a burned out lamp in a series circuit,
it would be “dead-ended” there and not allowed to go any further. What
is needed is a device to automatically “detour” the current on to the
other lamps when one blows.
Such a device is known as a film disc cutout and is installed between
the prongs of the series socket as shown in Figure B-8. It consists essen-
tially of a thin piece of paper or insulation. Under normal conditions
while current flows through the lamps, the pressure or voltage between
the prongs of the lamp is insufficient to break down the piece of paper
which is now acting as an insulator. However, when the lamp burns out,
current can no longer flow and the pressure or voltage builds up on the
prongs of the lamp, until the film of paper is punctured [see Figure B-
8(b)]. Thus, the circuit is automatically closed, the burned out lamp
being short-circuited and the rest of the lamps in the circuit remain lit.
A socket for series lighting is shown in Figure B-8(c). The prongs
and the film cutout are indicated. For multiple lighting, a socket of the

ordinary type, such as is found in household lamps is used. However, it
may be larger in dimension than the household socket, and is then
known as a Mogul socket.
The Constant-current Transformer
The lamps used in a series street-lighting circuit require a constant
current. Most lamps are designed to carry a current of 6.6 amperes. Any
change in this current value might cause flickering light, and therefore,
produce poor illumination. As the number of lamps in a series circuit
burn out and are then short circuited, the resistance of the circuit
changes and the current in the circuit will fluctuate provided the applied
voltage remains constant. Therefore, a good streetlighting circuit re-
quires the use of a transformer which will automatically vary the voltage
so that the current will remain constant.
Although many different mechanisms have been developed for the
constant-current transformer, they all do essentially the same thing. The
secondary coil moves up and down to vary the magnetic field.
The primary coil is usually fixed and the secondary floats (see
Figure B-9). The latter is balanced by a weight which is proportional
to the repulsion force of the rated current. If more than the rated sec-
ondary current flows, the repulsion becomes greater than the weight
and pushes the secondary farther away from the primary. This auto-
matically produces a greater leakage flux, which in turn, automati-

cally lowers the voltage, thus automatically lowering the current to its
rated value again.
CIRCUIT CONTROL
Astronomical Time Switch
The series circuit may be controlled at the substation. Here the
circuit is turned on or off at the proper lighting times either by hand or
by means of an astronomical time switch (see Figure B-10). This is merely
a switch actuated by a relay which opens or closes its contacts in accor-
dance with the hours of sunrise and sunset. These hours are reflected in
the shape of a cam which is driven by a small electric motor. As it turns,
it allows contacts to be made or broken, regulated by the shape of the
cam. These may be replaced by photocell controlled relays similar to
those located in the field.
The distinction between series and multiple lighting is that the
series lamps are designed to operate on circuits regulated for constant
current while multiple lamps are designed to operate on low-voltage
circuits regulated for constant voltage.
Figure B-9. Constant-current transformer.

Street Lighting
243
Photocell-Controlled Relay
On and off control of street lights is often accomplished through
the use of a photoelectric-controlled relay. Older systems use a photo-
tube [Figure B-11 (a)], which consists basically of a pair of electrodes
contained in an evacuated envelope. When properly connected into a
circuit, these electrodes allow more current to flow in the tube as the
intensity of the incident light increases. The phototube circuit is inte-
grated with a control circuit which incorporates a relay. When the cur-
rent in the phototube circuit reaches a predetermined value, the relay in
the control circuit functions and causes the lights to go out. As the day
darkens, the reverse action takes place. The current in the phototube
circuit decreases until another predetermined value is reached. Then the
relay in the control circuit functions and the lights are turned on.
Newer systems use a solid-state photocell [Figure B-11 (b)] instead
of a phototube. The operation is essentially the same as that of the pho-
Figure B-10. Astronomical time switch.

244

totube system, but the use of a photocell reduces maintenance because
the life of a photocell is very much longer than that of a phototube.
Street-Lighting Accessories
Street lights may be installed on steel, aluminum, or concrete stan-
dards, usually fed from underground cables. More often they are at-
tached to some fixture or bracket attached to a pole. The shapes and
types of fixtures vary widely.
Street-light lamps, without any equipment, in general emit light in
all directions. Upward light may be of value in certain business areas
where the facades of buildings so illuminated act as secondary sources
of light, reduce glare, and are generally pleasing in appearance. How-
ever, in most cases it is desirable to modify the distribution of light from
the lamps and three general types of equipment are

tocell.

diffusing glassware.
Lamps may be equipped with reflectors only, refractors only, or
diffusing globes only. They may also be equipped with any combination
of these three or with all three. The three devices are sometimes incor-
porated into one unit (see Figure B-12).
A reflector (Figure B-13) is practically opaque; the light rays hitting
its surface are stopped and redirected in the desired direction. A reflector
may be of porcelain, enameled porcelain, metal, silvered glass, and sil-
vered or other plated metals. There are various shapes of reflectors de-
signed to give different types of light distribution.
A refractor (Figure B-14) is transparent; the light rays hitting its
surface are bent and pass through in the desired direction. In the ordi-
nary lamp, a large portion of the light is emitted in directions away from
the street, and is wasted in so far as street illumination is concerned. It
is the function of the refractor to intercept a large share of this light and
Figure B-12. A pendant luminaire having a reflector, a refractor, and
diffusing glassware.

to redirect it on the street surface.
This builds up the illumination
around the street light fixture and
utilizes the light more efficiently.
Glassware is used for various
purposes. It may be used for protec-
tion to the lamp, or it may be used,
as in most cases, in order to de-
crease the brilliancy of the light
source and make the globe itself act
as a secondary light source. In per-
forming the latter function, diffus-
ing glass is used (Figure B-15). This
glass is usually rippled in some way, to diffuse the light and make a large,
even light source. To reduce damage from vandalism, glass is often re-
placed by clear plastic.
STREET-LIGHTING LAMPS
Street-lighting Lamps
The usual lamp used in
street-lighting circuits is of the
regular incandescent type
similar to those found in the
home. In this type, light is
given off from a piece of wire
(filament) heated white hot.
The amount of light which
can be obtained from this
type lamp is limited by its physical dimensions and the manufacturing
facilities.
The important elements of the incandescent lamp shown in Fig-
ure B-16, (or bulb, as we call it in the home) are the tungsten fila-
ment, a mandrel on which this filament is wound, and inert gases
which cool the filament to cut down on evaporation and carry any
tungsten which does evaporate to the top of the lamp. The reader has
often noticed that an incandescent bulb gets a dark spot on top after
long use. This is the evaporated tungsten. The gas is usually a nitro-

gen-argon combination.
To obtain more illumination from devices and still maintain
practical dimensions, other types of lighting have been developed.
Fluorescent lamps shown in Figure B-17(a) usually one or more tubes
4 feet in length, similar to those found in stores, factories, and other
establishments, are used along boulevards, in tunnels, parking lots
and other special situations where brilliant lighting is required. These
lamps are connected for multiple circuits. A coating of fluorescent ma-
terial applied to the inside of the glass tube is made to glow and give
off light when acted on by rays, somewhat similar to x-rays, pro-
Figure B-15. Diffusing glassware prevents glare, is usually rippled,
and comes in many different shapes. (a) Upright fixture (underground
wired) and (b) pendant fixtures (overhead wired).

duced by the flow of electricity.
The fluorescent lamp unit generally consists of 2 electrodes, one
at either end of the tube. These electrodes emit and receive, receive
and emit electrons between them in an operation that resembles a
tennis match. A drop of mercury [see Figure B-17(b)] is added inside
the tube to make it start or light up initially. A “ballast” device is in-
cluded in the circuit to permit the electrodes to reach sufficient volt-
age to start the arc going across the tube. Fluorescent tubes can be
made to shed other colors besides the well known blue-white.
Discharge Lamps
Where high-intensity illumination is required (along highways,
for example) a discharge lamp fits the bill. The primary advantage of
a gaseous discharge lamp is that it can give out much more light for
its size than an incandescent lamp of comparable size. Sodium and
mercury are commonly used materials for discharge lamps (see Fig-
ure B-18). Designers have discovered that all-around these are the
most economical chemicals with respect to supplying the proper tem-
perature, voltage, and pressure.
In the mercury-vapor lamp, the mercury is vaporized by the
current flowing through the lamp. (Again the current is controlled by
Figure B-16. Basic construction of the incandescent lamp,

a ballast.) When the current continues through the gaseous mercury,
the gas gives off great amounts of concentrated green-blue light.
With sodium, the principle of operation is the same, but the light
produced is a highly intense yellow-orange. Discharge lamps are usually
designed for multiple-circuit operation. Other materials are also used
and are generally included in the class of halogen lamps.

(The quality of electric service is, importantly, determined by the rapid-
ity of restoration to normal during contingency conditions. This consid-
eration is intimately tied to economics that, in turn, affects the design,
construction, and operation of utility systems. Here, the ability to locate
facilities and obtain data constitutes perhaps the greatest contribution to
the quality of service.)
INTRODUCTION
The grid coordinate system is the key that ties together two impor-
tant tools, maps and computers. Maps are a necessity for the better
operation of many enterprises, especially of utility systems. Their effec-
tiveness can be increased manyfold by adding to their information data
contained in other files. Much of the latter data are now organized and
stored in computer-oriented files-on punched cards and on magnetic
tapes, drums, disks, and cells. Generally, these data can be retrieved
almost instantly by CRTs (cathode ray tubes) or printouts. The link that
makes the correlation of data contained on the maps and in the files
practical is the grid coordinate system.
Essentially, the grid coordinate system divides any particular area
served into any number of small areas in a grid pattern. By superimpos-

ing on a map a system of grid lines, and assigning numbers to each of
the vertical and horizontal spacings, it is possible to define any of the
small areas by two simple numbers. These numbers are not selected at
random, but have some meaning. Like any graph, these two coordinates
represent measurements from a reference point; in this respect they are
similar to navigation’s latitude and longitude measurements.
Further subdivision of the basic grid areas into a series of smaller
grids is possible, each having a decimal relation with the previous one
(i.e., by dividing each horizontal and vertical space into tenths, each
resultant area will be one hundredth of the area considered). By using
more detailed maps of smaller scale, it is possible to define smaller and
smaller areas simply by carrying out the coordinate numbers to further
decimals. For practical purposes, each of these grid areas should mea-
sure perhaps not more than 25 feet by 25 feet (preferably less, say 10 feet
by 10 feet) and should be identified by a numeral of some 6 to 12 digits.
For example, by dividing by 10, an area of 1,000,000 feet by
1,000,000 feet (equivalent to some 190 square miles) can be divided into
100 smaller areas of 100,000 feet by 100,000 feet each, identified by two
digits, one horizontal and one vertical. This smaller area can again be
subdivided into 100 smaller areas of 10,000 feet by 10,000 feet each,
identified by two more digits, or a total or four with reference to the
basic 1,000,000 feet square area. Breaking down further into 1000- by
1000 feet squares and repeating the process allows these new grids to be
identified by two more digits, or a total or six. Again dividing by 10 into
units of 100 feet by 100 feet, and adding two more digits, produces a
total of eight digits to identify this grid size. One more division produces
grids of 10 feet by 10 feet and two more digits in the identifying number-
for a total of 10 digits, not an excessive number to be handled for the
grid size under consideration; see Figure A-1.
This process may be carried further where applications requiring
smaller areas are desirable; however, each further breakdown not only
reduces the accuracy of the measurements, but also adds to the number
of digits, which soon becomes unmanageable. Experience indicates that
a “comfortable” system should contain 10 digits or fewer for normal
usages.
While the decimal relation has been mentioned, other relations can
be used, such as sixths, eighths, and so on, or combinations, such as
eighths and tenths, and others.

Standard References
The grid pattern applicable to each of the several scale maps may be
printed directly on each map as light background lines, perhaps even in a
different color, or printed on the back of the maps when they are repro-
duced. Alternately, a grid overlay can be applied to each map to be used
when it is necessary to determine a grid coordinate for an item on the
map. The actual grid number need not be printed on every item on every
map unless desired. Such numbers assigned to key locations on each map
normally suffice; the others may be determined from the grid background
or overlay. To maintain their permanence and to minimize distortion from
expansion and contraction because of changing humidity and tempera-
ture, the maps should be printed on a material such as Mylar, a translu-
cent polyester-base plastic film; this is especially true of the base maps
from which others of different scales and purposes are derived.
As much as practical, the data on the maps should be uncluttered
and as legible as possible. It may be desirable in some instances to pro-
vide two or more maps (of the same scale) for several purposes; marks
for coordinating these several maps, should it be necessary, may be in-
cluded on each of the maps.
Maps may be further uncluttered by deliberately removing as
much of the information on them as appears desirable and practical and
consigning such information to files readily accessible by computer. In
many instances, this information already is included or duplicated in
such files, but may need to be labeled with the appropriate grid coordi-
nate number. The use of CRTs and printouts makes this information
available at will.
The grid coordinate number corresponding to the location of an
item in question is added to its record and now becomes its computer
address.
COORDINATE DATA HANDLING
As implied earlier, the grid coordinate system provides an easy
and simple but, more important, a very rapid means of obtaining data
from files through the use of the computer. In some respects, it assigns
addresses to data in the same way as the ZIP code system in use by the
postal service. The manner in which the grid number may be used is
illustrated in the following examples; for convenience they refer to elec-
tric utility systems, although obviously they apply equally well to other

The Grid Coordinate System: Tying Maps to Computers
255
endeavors employing maps and records.
Data contained on maps and records generally apply to the con-
sumers served and the facilities installed to serve them. While maps
depict (by area) the geographic and functional (electrical) interrelation-
ship between these several components, the records supply a continuing
history (by location) of each component item (consumers and facilities).
In the case of consumers, such data may include, in addition to the
grid coordinate number, the name and post office address. Also a history
of electric consumption (and demand where applicable), billing, and
other pertinent data over a continuing period, usually 18 or 24 months.
There may also be data on the consumer’s major appliances; also the
data and work order number of original connection and subsequent
changes. The grid coordinate number of the transformer from which the
consumer is supplied is included, as well as that for the pole or under-
ground facility from which the service to the consumer is taken. Some-
times interruption data may be included. Other data may include
telephone number, tax district, access details, hazards (including ani-
mals), dates of connection or reconnection, insurance claims, easements,
meter data, meter reading route, test data, credit rating, and other per-
tinent information. Only a small portion of these data are shown on
maps, usually in the form of symbols or code letters and numerals. In
the case of facilities, such data may include, in addition to the grid co-
ordinate number, location information, size and kind of facility (e.g.,
pole, wire, transformer, etc.). date installed or changed, repairs or re-
placements made (including reason therefor, usually coded), original
cost, work order numbers, crew or personnel doing work, construction
standard reference, accident reports, insurance claims, operating record,
test data, tax district, and other pertinent information. Similarly, only a
small portion of these data are shown on maps, usually in the form of
symbols or code letters and numerals.
Data from other sources also may be filed by grid number for
correlation with consumer and facility information for a variety of pur-
poses. Such data may include government census data; police records of
crime, accidents, and vandalism; fire and health records; pollution mea-
surements; public planning; construction and rehabilitation plans; zon-
ing restrictions; rights-of-way and easement locations; legal data; plat
and survey data; tax district; and such other information that may affect
or be useful in carrying out utility operations.
Obviously, all these data, whether pertaining to the consumer or to

256
Electrical Power Distribution Systems
the utility’s facilities, are not necessarily contained on one map or in one
record only; indeed, there may be several maps and records involved,
each containing certain amounts of specialized or functionally related
data. All, however, may be correlated through the grid coordinate system.
Data Retrieval
Data contained in the files may be retrieved by means of the com-
puter and may be presented visually by means of CRTs for one-time
instant use, or by printouts and automatic plotting for repeated use over
an indefinite time period. Data presented may be the exact original data
as contained in one or more files, or extracted data obtained as a result
of correlating data residing in one or more files, or a combination of
both; such extracted data may or may not be retained in separate files for
future use.
These data may be retrieved for an individual consumer or an
individual item of plant facilities, or may be other data for a particular
area, small or large. The various specific purposes determine what data
are to be retrieved and how they are to be presented. They also deter-
mine the programs and equipment required. Data thus retrieved then
are used with data contained on the map to help in forming the deci-
sions required. The decisions may include new data that can be reen-
tered in the files as updating material, that can be plotted or printed for
exhibit purposes, or that can be re-entered on maps for updating or
expanding the material thereon; all of these may be done by means of
the computer.
The grid coordinate number is applied to utility facilities for ease
of location and positive identification in the field. In the case of electric
utilities, these may include services, meters, poles, towers, manholes,
pull boxes, transformers, transformer enclosures, switches, disconnects,
fuses, lightning arresters, capacitors, regulators, boosters, streetlights, air
pollution analyzers, and other equipment and apparatus; also the loca-
tion of laterals on the transmission and distribution circuits.
OTHER APPLICATIONS
Similarly, for gas utilities, the applications of grid coordinate num-
bers may include mains, services, meters, regulators, valves, sumps, test
pits, and other equipment; also the location of boosters, laterals, and

The Grid Coordinate System: Tying Maps to Computers
257
nodes on the gas systems. For water systems, they may include mains,
services, meters, valves, dams, weirs, pumps, irrigation channels, and
other facilities. For telephone and telegraph communication systems,
including CATV circuits, they may include mains, services, terminals,
repeaters, microwave reflectors, and other items including poles, man-
holes, and special items.
Grid coordinate numbers also may find application in many other
lines of endeavor; highway systems, railway systems, oil fields, social
surveys (police, health, income, population distribution, etc.), market
surveys (banks and industries), municipal planning and land use stud-
ies, nonclassical archaeology, geophysical studies, and others where
such means of location identification may prove practical.
The use of grid coordinates facilitates positive identification in the
field; the numbers are posted systematically on facilities, such as
streetlight or traffic standards, poles, and structures, and at corners or
other prominent locations.
An atlas, consisting of a grid overlay on a geographical map, aids
the field forces in locating consumers and plant facilities and provides a
common basis for communication between office and field operating
personnel.
With the national consensus apparently pointing to an ultimate
metric system for the United States for conform with world standards,
the adoption of a grid coordinate system provides an excellent opportu-
nity for its introduction with a minimum of conversion effort.
With the advent of the computer, it was inevitable that the grid
coordinate system should be developed to provide a simple means of
addressing the computer. The grid number provides the link between
the map and the vast amount of data managed by the computer. This
happy marriage of two powerful tools results not only in better opera-
tions but in improved economy as well. It is a must in the modernization
of operations in many enterprises and especially in utility systems.
