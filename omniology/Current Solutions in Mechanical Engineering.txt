PREFACE 
 
The International Conference on Mechanical Engineering (ICOME 2015 Conference) is the third 
event of a series that has been started in 2010, organized by The Faculty of Mechanics from the 
University of Craiova, Romania.  
The aim of the conference is to bring together researchers, industry professionals, and students 
from the broad range of disciplines referring to Mechanical Engineering, in a collegial and 
stimulating environment. The ICOME 2015 Conference provided a platform for researchers, 
engineers as well as industrial professionals to present their latest experiences and developments 
activities in the field of Mechanical Engineering.  
The Conference also provided opportunities for the scientists to exchange their scientific 
achievements, to exchange new ideas and application experiences face to face, build up national and 
international collaboration in the mechanical engineering field and to find global partners for future 
collaboration.  
The ICOME Conference has grown from edition to edition and so we happily notice this year a 
remarkable participation, with valuable contribution, from Romania and also from abroad. 
The Conference opening took place in the magnificent Blue Hall from Central building of 
University of Craiova, and almost 300 participants, guests and scientist attended it. At the opening 
ceremony participated important scientists as invited speakers from United States and Romania and 
guests from local authorities and local business companies. 
This proceedings book presents the most recent research results in mechanical engineering, 
intended to improve a variety of applications in daily life and industry. The conference book is 
published by Trans Tech Publication in Journal Applied Mechanics and Materials, and the 
addressed issues are: Modeling and simulation in mechanical engineering; Applied mechanics, 
mechatronic systems and robots; Automotive engineering; Mechanical engineering for biomedical 
applications; Materials and fabrication systems. The conference has solicited and gathered technical 
research submissions related to all aspects of major mechanical engineering themes and tracks. 
All papers were submitted on-line in the TTP site www.scientific.net and were also peer 
reviewed on-line by the reviewers drawn from the scientific committee, external reviewers and 
editorial board, depending on the subject matter of the paper. 
The paper presentation was organized in the beautiful Romanescu University’s House from 
Craiova, where more than 90 papers were sustained. All the presentations where very much 
appreciated, and a lot of discussions were generated after the papers presentations. as a general 
remark, most of the researches were done by young scientists, which are doing their doctorate 
studies. 
We would like to express our gratitude to the authors who have contributed excellent papers on 
different subjects, covering many fields of Mechanical Engineering, and to the reviewers for the 
time, effort, and sharing their knowledge in order to improve the book quality. 
We hope that all participants and other interested readers benefit scientifically from the 
Proceedings. Finally, I believe in a complete success of the 4th ICOME 2017 Conference.

Abstract. The paper presents aspects regarding the virtual modeling, detailed design and FEM 
analysis of a testing device, to be used to fix small pieces in tribological tests. First there are 
presented some aspects of the device virtual modeling and drafting, using CATIA software. Then 
are defined the geometrical and kinematical restrictions between the parts. Finally, there are 
presented some aspects about the Finite Element Analysis and the results of this, using ANSYS 
software. In the final part of the paper, there are presented the conclusions of the simulation.  
Introduction 
Virtual modeling, detail design, and FEM analysis of mechanical products using computer 
performing software is a necessity. For a company, it saves time in product developing, reduces the 
number of physical prototypes and experiments, reduces the prices of product and also, increases 
the quality of product [1, 2, 3]. The paper presents aspects regarding the virtual modeling, detail 
design, and FEM analysis of a testing device, to be used to keep small pieces, as plates, for 
tribological tests. 
Generally, the tribometers are used to study the friction between two surfaces in contact [4, 5]. 
The contact surfaces belong to real pieces, which are adjusted to be a mechanical structure (for 
example the chain links or a joint between two links).  
For testing different pieces, the tribometer has its own devices, to fit the parts together. But, there 
are situations when the pieces to be tested are particular, so cannot be fitted in the tribometer device 
without some cutting, trimming or polishing operations. Usually, for small pieces, as plates or chain 
links, this could lead to the part destruction. To avoid this, is necessary to design an adequate 
special device, to be used to fix small pieces.

The required device has, as main parts (see Fig. 1): 
1. the device base, which, as dimensions, has to fit in tribometer; also, needs to keep the other 
parts, and, also, to serve as oil bath; 
2. the elastic element, used to keep the plate fixed to be tested; 
3. the main screw, used to fix the plate to be tested, through the elastic element; 
4. the screws used to keep the elastic element; 
5. the device cover.

The Virtual Modelling 
For virtual modellig, the CATIA software is used [1, 2]. First step is to sketch the testing device 
parts. To fit the device in the tribometer, the main dimension are corresponding to this. Then, using 
Part Design module, the each part’s virtual model is completed. The standard parts, as screws, can 
be chosen from the software virtual library. The parts are presented in Fig. 2, a - e.

Then, in Assembly Design module, the device assembly is computed, using the corresponding 
constraints. The assembled device is presented in figure 3. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For testing device manufacturing, the technical documentation is required [2]. The detail 
drawings and the ensemble drawing are computed in the Drafting module.  
 
The Finite Element Analysis 
The device wear part is the elastic element, which serve to keep the plate fixed to be tested. The 
elastic element has to support, during tribological tests, on one surface, the contact pressure given 
by the main screw load, and, on the other surface, the contact pressure given by the fixed piece 
(plate or chain link for example).  
In the analysis, a chain link part (Fig. 4, a) is needed to be fixed in the device (Fig. 4, b).

For the analysis, is considered the finite element model of the elastic element, presented in Fig. 
2, c. The main screw acting load is equal with 3200 N and the other surface of the elastic element is 
fixed on the contact areas, depending by the chain link supposed to be fixed in the device, as is 
presented in Fig. 5.

There are considered 4 types of contact areas for the contact between the elastic element and the 
chain link, presented in Fig. 6, a - d. These contact areas are depending by the chain link size and 
type. For the finite element analysis is used the ANSYS software [6, 7]. 
The values of the displacements obtained for the analysed variants are presented in Fig. 7 a - d.

Conclusions 
For all the studied cases, the maximum values of the displacements are below 1 mm, which lead 
to the conclusion that the elastic element will resist to the stresses caused by main screw, when 
fixing the chain link. The chain link need to remain fixed during the tests, especially when the 
mating part translation starts or ends.  
The experimental approach, to study the friction between two surfaces in contact using the 
designed device is in progress, and will be presented in other paper.

Abstract. The work deals with the optimal design of a single-axis solar tracker, which is used to 
adjust the daily position of a photovoltaic system in order to capture as much as possible solar 
radiation. The two main components of the solar tracker (the mechanical device and the control 
system) have been coupled (integrated) in the concurrent engineering concept. For assuring high 
stability and robustness, the control system is a cascaded two-loop employing LPF (Low-Pass 
Filter) controllers. The controlled parameter in the main (external) loop is the daily angle of the 
photovoltaic platform, while in the secondary (internal) loop the linear velocity in the driving 
actuator is monitored. The mono-objective optimization problem is described in the following way: 
to minimize the difference between the imposed and current daily angle (thus preserving a high 
energetic efficiency of the tracking system), considering the controllers’ gains as independent 
design parameters. 
Introduction 
The energetic efficiency of the photovoltaic (PV) panels depends on the degree of use and 
conversion of the solar radiation [1, 2]. To increase the solar input, solar trackers are frequently 
used, the energetic efficiency of the PV panels equipped with tracking systems being higher (with 
20% -50% during the year) relative to the equivalent static PV panels (without tracking) [3-8].   
The tracking systems contain mechanisms actuated by motor sources (rotary or linear actuators), 
which are controlled to ensure the optimal position of the PV panel. Depending on the number of 
degrees of freedom, two basic types of tracking systems can be systematized: single-axis trackers 
(they are frequently used for the diurnal motion of the PV panel, from East to West), and bi-axis 
trackers (for the diurnal and elevation motions).    
For the bi-axis systems, in relation with the relative position of the revolute axes, different 
configurations of tracking mechanisms can be obtained, such as polar tracking systems (where the 
revolute axis of the diurnal movement is parallel with the polar axis), or azimuthal systems (where 
the axis of the diurnal rotation is disposed in vertical direction). Additional types of bi-axis systems 
can be obtained from the basic types, for example the pseudo-azimuthal system, which is derived 
from the azimuthal system, having the main/daily rotational axis positioned on the horizontal 
(North-South). Due to its stability, the main application of this system is for the photovoltaic 
platforms, meaning more PV panels installed (disposed) on common structure/frame.   
It was proven that for Brașov geographical area a mono-axis solar tracker is more suited than a 
bi-axis tracker because the energy gain brought by the bi-axis system does not justify the added cost 
of the seasonal orientation [9]. Under these terms, the work deals with the modeling and simulation 
of the single-axis version of a pseudo-azimuthal tracking system, which is used to adjust the daily 
position of a PV platform. The study is focused on the optimal design of the control device, 
intending to minimize the tracking errors, in other words the solar radiation losses due to the 
positioning deviations of the PV platform induced by the controller design. The simulations have 
been performed by using the virtual prototype of the solar tracker, which integrates the MBS 
(Multi-Body System) model of the mechanical device and the DFC (Design for Control) model of 
the control system.

Tracking Mechanism Design 
As mentioned, the single-axis version of a pseudo-azimuthal solar tracker is used to adjust the daily 
motion (from East to West) of the PV platform, which contains three panels (in-line arrangement), 
the active surface being 5.04 m2 (1.68 m2 per panel). The virtual model of the tracking mechanism, 
which was developed by using the MBS (Multi-Body System) software package ADAMS, is shown 
in figure 1. The tracking system is actuated by a linear actuator, the motion being transmitted to the 
platform by a belt transmission (Poly-V grooved belt system), which acts as a stroke amplifier (with 
1:2 transmission ratio), thus allowing to use an actuator with small dimension (power). The belt 
system was created by using ADAMS/Machinery, which is incorporated in to the ADAMS/View 
preprocessing environment.  
 
 
Fig. 1. The MBS model of the mono-axis solar tracker. 
 
The actuator is connected by spherical joints to the adjacent parts (the middle fixed pillar, and the 
link extension of the driving pulley). The supporting frame of the PV panels is connected to the 
three pillars (front, middle and rear) through revolute joints (bearings). The driving pulley (driver) 
of the belt transmission rotates relative to the middle pillar, while the driven pulley (follower) is 
rigidly connected to the supporting frame (the PV platform). The whole PV platform (including the 
panels and the supporting frame) weighs around 240 kg. 
The optimal design of the mechanical device, intending to minimize the motor force developed by 
the linear actuator (and in this way, the power/energy consumption for performing the tracking), 
was conducted in a similar way with the study presented in [10]. The global coordinate of the 
design points in which the spherical connections of the actuator are located have been used as 
independent design variables for the optimization process. 
The PV platform can be rotated from sunshine (East) to sunset (West) without brakes during the 
day-light, or can be discontinuously driven (step-by-step motion), the maximum angular field for 
the daily motion being of 180º (±90º relative to the noon position). The continuous tracking allows 
obtaining the optimal incidence, but it also generates some problems, such as the long operation 
time of the system, the need to perform very large transmission ratios (the tracking velocity being 
very low), or the behavior of the system under the action of non-stationary external perturbations 
(such as wind) whose effect can be amplified if the system is in motion. 
On the other hand, the solar radiation has small values in the limit positions (at sunshine and 
sunset), and for this reason it is not efficient to track the sun in these areas (the radiation gain does

not justify the energy consumption for tracking). The optimal design of the motion law was 
approached in [6], considering an algorithm based on the mathematical modeling of the incident 
solar radiation. The design variables in the optimization process of the motion law for the step-by-
step tracking refer to the angular field of the daily motion, the number of steps, and the actuating 
timetable, data which depends on the day of the year for which the simulation is performed.  
The numerical simulations in this paper have been performed considering the summer solstice 
day (June, 21), the corresponding tracking law being defined by the following data (see fig. 2): the 
angular domain of the daily motion – ε ∈ [+60°, -60°] (ε - the daily angle, which is null at noon), 
the number of tracking steps - 8 (in other words, the motion step size is ∆ε=15°), the actuating times 
(in local time) - 8.21, 9.53, 10.76, 11.75, 12.79, 13.78, 15.01, 16.33. After sunset, the system returns 
to its initial position, with continuous (without brakes) motion. 
The tracking law is used as input in the optimization process of the control system for the pseudo-
azimuthal tracking mechanism, the daily angle being measured in the revolute joint between the PV 
platform and the middle pillar.

Optimal Design of the Control Device 
The solar tracker in study is a mechatronic system that integrates the mechanical device (shown in 
fig. 1) and the controlled operating device. The control system is developed in the concept of the 
concurrent engineering, through the integration with the MBS model at the virtual prototype level 
[11]. In this respect, the virtual prototyping platform integrates a DFC (Design for Control) software 
solution - EASY5, which exchanges information with the MBS software - ADAMS.  
Regarding the control system, the literature presents a series of schemes, with one or more loops 
[12-14]. For the present work, a control system with two loops, in cascade configuration, has been 
selected. The monitored/controlled parameter in the main (external) loop is the daily angle of the 
photovoltaic platform, while in the secondary (internal) loop the linear velocity in the driving 
actuator is controlled. In this configuration, the main variable is controlled by adjusting the 
reference of the secondary variable. Thus, an improved control of the main variable is insured, 
which is less affected by perturbations. This type of control system has resulted from testing various 
configurations, reaching the conclusion that it represents the minimum needed, from complexity 
point of view, which ensures resolving the control problem of the considered solar tracker. 
The communication (data transfer) between the MBS and DFC models is assured by the input 
and output variables (plants).  As input plant (in the MBS model), the control force in the linear 
actuator is used, while the daily angle of the PV platform and the linear velocity in actuator are used 
as output plants (in a 2-loop cascade configuration). The input variable takes the value from the 
DFC model, while the output variables are created by using specific ADAMS/View functions, 
namely “Angle about Axis” (for the daily angle), and “Velocity along Axis” (for the linear 
velocity).  
Applied Mechanics and Materials Vol. 823

The data transfer between ADAMS and EASY5 is assured by using ADAMS/Controls, which is 
a plug-in that manages the files used during the co-simulation, as follows: I/O plants file (inf), 
ADAMS/View command file (cmd), and ADAMS/Solver dataset file (adm). The I/O plants file is 
used in EASY5 for configuring the ADAMS Mechanism extension block.  
Under these terms, the control system model is shown in figure 3, where the Tabular Function 
block is used to model the imposed control law (i.e. the reference signal), in terms of time-history 
variation of the daily angle (see fig. 2). The block provides a table as a function of time, linear 
interpolation being used between the time points. For performance and cost reasons, low-pass filters 
(LPF) are used for the position and velocity controllers, whose modeling in EASY5 was carried out 
by using first-order lag transfer functions, in time constant format. 
 
 
Fig. 3.  The control system with 2-loop cascade configuration. 
 
Designing the position and velocity controllers consists in determining the optimum values of the 
gain factors for the primary (outer) and secondary (inner) control loops (K1 and K2). The 
optimization procedure is similar with the one used to optimize the mechanical device of the 
tracking system [10]. To access the parametric optimization procedure, it is necessary that the 
control system model from figure 3 to be transferred in ADAMS. The model is exported from the 
EASY5 interface through the ESL (External System Library) format, specifying the system 
parameters that will be identified in ADAMS as design parameters. Once imported in ADAMS, in 
the form of a general state equation (GSE), the parameterized model of the control system, 
connected to the MBS model of the mechanical device, becomes available for optimization.  
The tracking error is considered as objective function, the optimization goal being to minimize 
the root mean square (RMS) during simulation (fig. 4), which is a measure of the magnitude of the 
tracking error varying quantity. The function (F) is explicitly defined in the control system model 
(see fig. 3) as difference between the imposed (εi) and current (εc) values of the daily angle,

markers placed in the revolute joint that connects the platform frame to the middle sustaining pillar. 
As independent variables for optimization there have been considered the amplification factors 
of the position (K1) and velocity (K2) controllers, for which the variation fields have been defined in 
the range K1,2∈[1, 104]. The OptDes-GRG (Generalized Reduced Gradient) algorithm was used in 
the optimization process, thus obtaining the optimum values of the design variables, as follows: 
K1=3400, K2=1800. The tracking error during simulation is very small (fig. 5), the root mean square 
being of 10-6 order, which proves the viability/utility of the optimization process. Insignificant 
variations occur during the tracking steps, in the stationary positions the steady-state errors being 
practically null, which ensure optimal sunray incidence. For comparison, in the initial control 
design, considering the standard values of the amplification factors K1,2=100, there was obtained 
FRMS=0.8727. The improvement brought by the optimal design of the controllers is a considerable 
one, proving the usefulness of the proposed/adopted optimization algorithm. 
Another important result of the dynamic analysis is the energy consumption for performing the 
tracking (fig. 6), which was obtained by integrating the power consumption curve in absolute value. 
The small energy consumption (Ec≅113 Wh/day, while in the initial design the consumption is 
higher by about 6%, mainly due to the signal overshoots - see figure 5), which is a cumulative effect 
of the optimal design of the mechanical and control devices of the solar tracker, has a beneficial 
contribution on the energetic efficiency of the PV system, which will be addressed in a future work.

angular domain, number of motion steps, operating/actuating timing table), in order to increase the 
energetic efficiency of the PV system, by maximizing the incident solar radiation, minimizing the 
energy consumption for performing the tracking, and minimizing the tracking (positioning) errors 
of the PV platform.  
Future researches in the field will be focused on improving the solar radiation model (by 
modeling the diffuse component), evaluating more complex control strategies, approaching the 
tracking system in bi-axial variant (by adding the elevation motion of the platform), manufacturing 
and implementing the physical prototype of the solar tracker. The control system circuit board will 
be realized by using a technique based on photoresist material and ultraviolet light [15].

Study of Particle Motion on a Helical Vibrating Surface  
POPESCU Diana Ioana

Abstract. The helical trough of a vibratory elevator induces, by its helical vibratory motion, a 
complex behavior to the transported parts. The paper analyses the displacement of a singular plate 
material particle on the cylindrical helix of a vibratory elevator, by decomposing the particle motion 
on slide and jump phases, dependent on the functional specific features of the vibratory equipment.  
A computer model of the particle motion was developed to study the theoretical average 
transportation velocity on the helical vibrating surface.  
Introduction 
The main application for the study of particle motion on vibrating surfaces is to the functioning 
of vibrating conveyors and shakers. The working principle of the vibratory conveyors consists in the 
vibratory driving of the transportation surface, aiming to induce directional motions of parts and 
materials along it. Their construction is simple, wear resistance, performing continuous transport, 
with uniform distribution. They are suitable to transport a large range of materials, even in harmful 
or high temperature environments, but can not be used for transporting sticky materials. One quality 
of vibratory conveyors, which recommends them in the case of fragile parts and friable materials, is 
that they do not damage the transported materials or parts.   
During the operation of the vibratory conveyor, the material moves on the trough by sliding with 
permanent contact, or through successive jumps, depending on the adjustment of the functional 
parameters of the equipment. Transport flow adjustment is relatively easily achieved, both manually 
and automatically, to fit the flow of the equipment or machine tool served by the conveyor. 
 The slide motion of a single plate particle on a helical vibrating surface 
The main approaches of the research, encountered in the literature, related to the motion of 
particles and parts on vibrating surfaces, are schematically shown in Fig. 1. Most studies are 
dedicated to the motion of a singular plate particle on plane vibrating surfaces [1, 2], mainly aimed 
at achieving the theoretical average transportation velocity and optimal values for driving 
parameters of the conveyor. Another approach is the one that studies the flow of small particle 
layers of granular material along the surface of the conveyor trough [3, 4]. 
Study principles remain the same in the case of helical vibratory conveyors, also named 
elevators. Their trough is assimilated to a helical surface, having cylindrical or conical shape [5, 6], 
which executes a complex helical vibratory motion, described by two equations: a translation on 
vertical direction and a rotation around the central axis of the trough (Fig. 2):

When this condition is not satisfied, the motion of the material particle will consist of small 
jumps. If no collisions with the lateral wall occur, the jump of the particle respects the trajectory of a 
free flight.  
The jump occurrence during the particle motion on a helical vibrating surface 
The particle executes a small jump during the moments noted with ts (start-jump) and ta (end- 
jump). To calculate the trajectory of the jump, one neglects the radial displacement, assuming that 
the particle remains all the time on the side surface of an imaginary cylinder of radius R. The 
particle motion during the small jump is calculated in the fixed reference system O1x1y1z1 (Fig. 2), 
being described by two components: the projection on the vertical axes O1z1 and the projection on 
the horizontal plane x1O1y1. After transposition in the mobile reference system Oxyz , the equations 
of jump motion are [5, 7]:

Computer modeling of the particle motion 
A computer program was developed to model the particle motion, consisting of jumps or slides, 
on the helical vibratory trough, as described above. The aim was to verify the before presented 
theory and to give an instrument for calculation of theoretical transportation velocity of the singular 
particle, for different driving and constructive parameters of the helical vibratory conveyor. The 
differential equation Eq. 2 was integrated using Runge-Kutta-Gill numerical method and the 
numerical results were presented in distance – time diagrams, as shown in Fig. 4.

In Fig. 4a the particle is sliding on the helical vibrating surface, the resulting motion being 
descendent for the driving frequency f = 16 Hz. For f ≥ 26 Hz the particle starts to jump, the 
resulting motion is presented in Fig. 4b: descendant for f < 28 Hz and ascendant for f > 28 Hz.  
Conclusions 
Distance-time diagrams, as shown in Fig. 4, enable the calculation of the theoretical average 
transportation velocity on the helical vibrating surface, which can be used to estimate the effective 
velocity of the transported material and then to obtain the transportation flow, a characteristics of 
the conveying equipment. The developed computer model of particle motion on helical vibrating 
surface can be used in the design stage of the vibratory elevators, in order to establish the optimal 
constructive solution and the limits for setting the driving parameters.

Abstract: The most outstanding parameter that governs the fatigue crack growth under tensile 
stresses field is the stress intensity factor, mode I, KI. This is a sufficient parameter to describe the 
whole stress field at the crack tip. An accurate stress intensity factor KI evolution was worked out 
taking into account the position of the crack center depth, and also, the residual stresses that act on 
the surface of the tooth, tensions that are linearly decreasing with the depth in the contact zone. On 
the other hand, the parameter that governs the crack fatigue growth in the case of compression 
stresses field is the stress intensity factor mode II, KII. This paper also presents the KII variation 
along pitch line with respect to the Hertzian contact stresses, the residual stresses and the crack 
centre depth of an initial crack in the sub-surface of the spur gear teeth, having different inclination 
angle α. As result of this study, some particular factors favorable to the propagation of the fatigue 
cracks towards the surface of the gear tooth were identified. The availability of a master curve for a 
particular material relating fatigue crack growth rate and range of stress intensity factor enables a 
designer to predict growth rates for any cracked body, and it is not limited to situations similar to 
those pertaining to the cracked stressed specimen used to generate the original data. 
Introduction 
It is generally accepted that there are three stages of evolution of the fatigue cracks, namely: stage 
I - the nucleation of the crack; it depends on the microstructure of the material; stage II 
corresponding to a stable crack growth, which depends mainly to the stress intensity factors 
variation ΔK, and stage III corresponds to a dramatic growing of the crack and has as result, 
eventually, the fracture of the component [1, 5]. 
Crack surfaces are stress-free boundaries adjacent to the crack tip and therefore dominate the 
distribution of stresses in that area. The representation of a crack tip stress field by a stress intensity 
factor (SIF) is a basic concept in fracture mechanics. 
In the elastic case, in concordance with the LEFM (Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics), the SIF is 
a sufficient parameter to describe the whole stress field at the tip of the crack and when the size of 
the plastic zone at the crack tip is small, compared to the crack length, the SIF may still give a good 
indication of the stress environment of the crack tip [1, 5]. 
These fields can be divided into three types corresponding to the three basic modes of crack 
surface displacement, and are conveniently characterized by the stress intensity factor, noted K with 
subscripts I, II, III, to denote the mode: mode I -  opening mode, mode II – sliding mode (in plane 
mode), mode III – shear mode. K is a function of the specimen dimensions and loading conditions. 
In general, it is proportional to (gross stress) x (crack length)1/2 [1, 3]. 
In the analysis of fatigue crack growth data, the fatigue cycle is usually described by                ΔK 
= (Kmax – Kmin), where Kmax and Kmin are the maximum and the minimum values of the SIF KI or KII 
during the fatigue cycle (Paris law) [1, 3, 5]:

where: da/dN - crack growth per cycle, mm/cycle (a - semilength of the fatigue crack, N - number of 
cycles); ΔKI (or ΔKII ) - stress intensity factor range, MPa·(mm)1/2; C, n - material constants in Paris 
law. 
From this point of view, SIF variation analysis, according to different parameters proves to be 
useful in identifying the conditions that may increase or impede the propagation of the fatigue 
cracks in the substrate of the gear teeth. 
In this paper, a simulation of the stress intensity factors KI and KII variation was conducted 
(hence, the possibility of fatigue crack to propagate), taking into consideration the existence of an 
initial crack in the substrate of a certain gear tooth, knowing the entire state of stresses field, size, 
inclination and position of the initial crack, the position of contact point on pitch line, residual 
stresses etc. 
Stresses field in the tooth sub-surface of gear 1 (z1 = 64) 
A contact between two spur gear teeth is considered. The material is AISI 1045 and some of the 
other parameters of the input are as follows: module m = 2.5 mm, number of teeth z1 = 64, z2 = 74, 
addendum modified coefficient x1 = x2 = 0, radial contact ratio εα = 1.804, width of gear 1 bw = 8.2 
mm, engine power P = 8.5 kW, number of revolutions of gear 1 shaft n1 = 930 rpm, normal force,  
Fn = 2526 N, linear load q = 308 N/mm, friction coefficient μ = 0.1, semi length of initial crack       
a = 0.05 mm, Xcontact = 2.0 mm (very near to the pitch point).

Fig. 1 Coordinate systems: a – along pitch line; b – on contact zone 
In Fig. 1a, N1N2 represents the pitch line, C (pitch point), N1A – curvature radius of involute at 
point A, mm, db1 – base diameter of the gear 1, mm. 
The surface and the sub-surface of the contact zone between points A and E corresponding to 
pitch line is considered on the gear 1 tooth (Fig. 1b). The coordinate system AXY is the same as the 
system AXY presented in Fig. 1a. The position of the current contact point is determined by the 
abscissa Xcontact. In the current contact point a local system xy is also anchored (Fig. 1b) [6]. 
On the contact zone, act simultaneously a normal force and a frictional force. Any point of 
material is subjected to normal and shear stresses due to the Hertzian and frictional stresses. 
In Fig. 2, the normal and shear stresses acting at a point on the substrate of a gear tooth, in 
relation to the systems XAY, xy and relative to the system xlocalylocal rotated by the angle α are 
presented. 
In this simulation, it was take into account the overall state of stresses that appears in gearing,

The normal and shear stresses due to the Hertzian load can be expressed by [4, 6]. 
Effective stresses in any point of the active surface or of its sub-surface of the gear 1 tooth with

Using Eq. 4 one can determine the values of normal and shear stresses in every point belonging 
to the crack (in crack coordinate system), for any crack position inside the material (Xcrack, Ycrack), 
for any length (2a) and inclination angle (α), and for any position (Xcontact). 
As it can be easily seen, the proposed simulation can analyze a multitude of parameters that 
influence the propagation of the fatigue cracks, which is suitable to be done by computer programs. 
The stress intensity factor KI variation under influences of crack center depth and residual 
tensions 
If the material is supposed to a tensile stress, fact that corresponds to a positive value of KI, the 
crack is growing in concordance with mode I. If there are compressive tensions in the local contact

zone, the stress intensity factor KI values are negative, fact that produces the compression of the 
crack faces, meaning that the crack development under this mode is obstructed. 
The most general case presume that the crack is inclined with an angle α with respect of axis AX 
(angle between the X and xlocal directions, measured counterclockwise) as shown in Fig. 1 b.  
The stress intensity factors mode I can be determined with Eq. 5 [6], which is the implementation 
of the relationship found in the literature [1, 5] for a crack whose edges are loaded with pressure and 
tangential forces distributed with arbitrary intensity (Fig. 3) [2, 6]:

In the following, the variation of the stress intensity factor KI along the pitch line was plotted, 
corresponding to different values of the residual stresses and the inclination angle of the initial 
fatigue crack α0. The different values for the crack center depth, Ycrack0, are set. 
All these graphs were computed and plotted by MathCad 14 Softwear.

The stress intensity factor KII variation under influences of crack center depth and residual 
tensions 
During the gearing process, due to the normal force in the contact point, the stresses field is 
predominantly a compressive one in the substrate of the gear tooth. Corresponding to this case, the 
crack propagates in sliding mode (mode II) driven by the cyclic stress caused by repeated rolling 
contact. So, the analysis of KII variation along the pitch line (Xcontact) as function of various 
parameters, such as the residual stresses, the position and inclination of the initial crack in the 
substrate, may offer strong clues in highlighting the possibility of the fatigue crack to propagate. 
The stress intensity factors mode I can be determined by expressions [5, 6]:

Conclusions 
In this study, a simulation of the stress intensity factors KI and KII variation along the pitch line, 
depending on various parameters such as the Hertzian stress, frictional and residual stresses, 
dimension, position and inclination of an initial crack in the substrate of the tooth was conducted in 
accordance with the intended purpose of the paper. 
Due to the fact that in the contact zone, if there are no residual stresses, KI have negative values, 
the crack growth under tensile mode is obstructed. 
The residual stresses can produce tensile tensions in the contact zone, so the crack can propagate 
under mode I; if qrez are increasing, crack growth probability under mode I increases. 
For α > π/2 the growing of qrez implies the growing of the positive values of KII (the greatest 
values being obtained for Xcontact ≅1.8 mm), so the crack is most favored to grow under mode II. 
The maximum variation of KII (ΔKII max) is obtained for Ycrack = 0.2 mm (near pitch point). 
The minimum variation of KII (ΔKII min) is obtained for the deepest Ycrack. 
The KII maximum positive values are increasing with inclination angle α and Xcontact, so the 
probability of crack growth under mode II is the greatest in these conditions.

stresses field, gear teeth 
Abstract: The values of the stress intensity factor (SIF) KI are almost always negative in the 
substrate of the gear teeth, due to the compressive stresses field. The more negative values are 
higher, respectively, the positive values are lower, the crack faces are more compressed, so the 
probability of crack propagation after the mode I is lower. Thus, the analysis of the factors leading 
to the minimum KI values may reveal the conditions that favor the fatigue crack propagation by 
opening mode. Instead, SIF KII is determinant in the growth rate of the fatigue crack by mode II, in 
terms of compressive stresses field. Thus, the more KII is higher, the propagation speed is higher, so 
an analysis of the factors that lead to its maximum value is very useful. The equivalent stress 
intensity factor Keq corresponds to a mixed-mode of loading and take into account the simultaneous 
influence of both stress intensity factors KI and KII. The variation of this factor can be used as a 
parameter of the modified Paris law, in order to study the propagation of the fatigue cracks in the 
case of mixed-mode loading of contact area between teeth flanks. SIFs variations were analyzed 
according to the state of stresses, position on the pitch line between the gear teeth flanks, position 
and angle of an initial crack in the gear tooth substrate, residual tensions etc. 
Introduction 
Pitting is one of the most important types of gears 
failure. There is a strong correlation between pitting and 
the Hertzian stresses, which are responsible for the 
initiation and propagation of the fatigue cracks, whatever 
these are initiated in the substrate or on the surface of the 
gear teeth. 
The stress intensity factors (SIF), noted K, govern the 
mechanisms of cracks propagation [1, 4, 6, 9]. Generally, a 
crack tip can be loaded under three different modes 
(Fig.1): mode I (opening mode, noted KI), mode II 
(sliding, or in-plane mode, noted KII), mode III (anti-plane 
shear mode, noted KIII). It is worth mentioning that most 
technical loading cases are a superimposition of different 
modes, called mixed-mode loading. 
As shown in Fig. 2, the stresses field acting on the surface of the gear tooth is almost always 
compressive (the three main stresses oriented in the three orthogonal directions, two on the tooth 
surface and one perpendicular to this), but only at the tooth base a tensile stress exists (the stress 
oriented perpendicularly to the surface of the tooth) [7, 10]. 
The aim of this article is to simulate the variation of the minimum value of KI and maximum 
value of KII during the gearing time, in the case that in the substrate of the gear tooth an initial crack

do exists and under the action of the whole stresses field 
(Hertzian, frictional, residual) it propagates on the surface of the 
gear tooth. These extreme values are of interest because may 
indicate few factors that favor the propagation of the fatigue 
cracks in the substrate of the tooth. 
The stresses field acting on subsurface crack faces 
In order to simulate the propagation of the initial crack 
located in the tooth substrate, several coordinates systems are 
used (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4): 
- 
XAY - is the general coordinate system related to the 
evolventic tooth flank, taking into account that the entry 
contact point between teeth flanks is A and the exit 
contact point is E; 
- 
xy - is related to the current contact point between teeth flanks; 
- 
xlocalylocal - corresponds to a certain point of the internal crack (current point). 
It is necessary to mention that the position of the initial crack is denoted by Xcrack, Ycrack 
coordinates, its length is 2a and the inclination angle (in correspondence with the general coordinate 
system XAY) is α .

The contact between gear teeth can be replaced by the contact between two cylinders. Their radii 
are equal to the curvature radii of the evolventic profiles of the teeth flanks in the contact point. The 
crack faces were loaded with normal and shear stresses of an arbitrary intensity, as result of the 
Hertzian stresses field and the friction between teeth flanks, as it was presented in Fig. 3. 
The Hertzian stresses field components are those found in the rolling contact theory [7, 10]. 
The frictional stresses are (corresponding to the case that the initial crack is in the subsurface of 
the gear tooth, y < 0) [8, 10]:

The stress intensity factors KImin and KIImax variation 
If the general case it is considered, in which the crack faces are loaded with pressure and shear 
forces distributed of an arbitrary intensity, the stress intensity factors KI and KII can be determined

the pitch point), material of the pinion AISI 1045. 
KImin variation with inclination angle α0, crack center depth Ycrack0 and residual stresses 
Based on Eq. 7, the variations of the minimum values of SIF KI, noted KImin, according to the 
inclination angle α0 of the initial crack in the substrate were represented (Fig. 5). 
The cases when the initial crack has different depths (Ycrack0 = 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.6 mm, 
respectively) and different values of residual stresses do exist (qrez = 0 and qrez = 200 MPa) were 
analyzed.

The variation of the equivalent stress intensity factor Keq 
As discussed above, in many cases the stresses field in the contact zone corresponds to a mixed-
mode of loading, making the crack to propagate simultaneously both after mode I and mode II. In 
order to study such a case, the equivalent stress intensity factor was introduced. This is a function of 
KI, KII and θ angle, which is the crack initiation angle [1, 2, 3, 5]. 
In the specialized literature, there are several models proposed to calculate this factor, among 
which Erdogan and Sih model [3]:

Further, this model will be used in order to simulate the variation of the equivalent stress 
intensity factor, with the following specifications: 
- 
as it was observed from the graphs above, in most cases the KI values are negatives, so the 
fatigue crack cannot propagate under mode I, unless there exist residual stresses; 
- 
for negative values of KI, it is considered that Keq coincides with the stress intensity factor KII; 
- 
it is assumed that the crack initiation angle remains constant, the value θ = arccos (1/6) [3]. 
Thus, the equivalent stress intensity factor Keq can be written [3, 5]:

Also, it is considered that the position of the initial crack center in the substrate is determined by

Conclusions 
Fatigue cracks propagation is in a close correlation with the stress intensity factors rates. KI 
produces a crack growth in opening mode, instead KII is responsible for crack propagation in mode 
II, in the compression stresses field.  
As it has been noted in the previous chapters, there is a complex overlapping state of stresses in 
the tooth substrate (normal, shear, Hertzian, frictional, residual stresses) which all influence the 
fatigue cracks growth. On the other hand, this is influenced by the other factors such as the position, 
size, and inclination angle of the initial crack in the substrate of the gear tooth. 
As result, the variation of the minimum values of KI, namely KImin was analyzed. It was observed 
that due to compressive stresses the values of KI are mostly negative. The minimum values (in 
absolute value) were obtained for an inclination angle α0 ≈ 105º, angle that seems to be the most 
favorable for the crack growth in mode 1. 
The KImin value was even lower as the initial crack depth Ycrack0 was lower. 
The positive values of K1min were obtained only if positive residual stresses do exist in the 
substrate, so only in this case it is possible for a fatigue crack to propagate through mode I.  
On the contrary, in most cases KIImax values are positive, so the fatigue crack may propagates 
through sliding mode. The minimum values of KIImax are obtained for an inclination angle of about 
α0 ≈ 40º…60º, angle at which it seems that the crack growth is the strongest prevented. It can be 
also observed that, as the crack depth is smaller, the KIImax is greater, so the probability of the 
fatigue crack to propagate is higher. 
The equivalent stress intensity factor Keq corresponds to a mixed-mode loading and take into 
account the simultaneous influence of both stress intensity factors KI and KII.  
The Erdogan&Sih model was used in order to simulate the variation of Keq along Xcontact, with 
regard to the inclination angle α0 and qrez = 100 MPa (linearly decreasing with the depth).  
It was observed that the values of Keq are mainly positive for inclination angles greater than 
7π/12, maximum values being obtained for Xcontact ≈ 2.0 mm (very near to the pitch point). These 
are the conditions that, according to this simulation, are the most favorable for the fatigue crack to 
propagate in mixed-mode conditions.

Abstract. As is known, the gearing seems the principal excitation source into the components of the 
power transmission. The momentary movements of pinion driving gear and driven gear are 
represented by six liberty degrees, three translations and three rotations. The fluctuations of the 
conveyance error and of the gearing rigidity are the principal causes of the excitations associated to 
this one. For the conveyance error, it is necessary to tell the consequences of the elastic 
deformations from the kinematic consequences associated to the gearing of the non-mating profiles. 
In this paper is presented the simulation of the conveyance error associated to the eccentricity faults. 
In order to obtain the dynamic response it is suggested the using of the integral Laplace’s transform. 
The Mechanical Model of the Gearing 
 
Let’s consider the gearing of the two toothed wheels, the driving gear 1 and the driven gear 2, 
from the Fig.1. The gearing of those toothed wheels can be simulated [1] by the rolling without 
sliding of a straight-line along the two base circles with eccentricities e1, respectively, e2, (Fig.1). 
The condition of the rolling without sliding is expressed by the relation (1):

In [2] is presented a study about the vibrations of a gear, a model with two liberty degrees, rigid 
bodies and flexible teeth. There are taking into account the rotation liberty degrees qi=θi  of the 
driving and driven gear and the effect of friction by introducing the friction torque in the movement 
equation. The variation of friction torque grouped with the distribution of the loading between teeth 
and with the action of driving torque Cm and of the loading torque Cs acts like a excitation source. It 
can assume that the two torques may be constant. The distribution of the loading has as effect a 
rigidity fluctuation. The model includes the inertia movement Jp of driving gear, those of driven 
gear Jr, the rigidity [K] and the contact damping [C].The friction torque is introduced in the 
equilibrium equation. The mathematical model of the forced and damping vibrations has the form:

Conclusions 
 
The paper presents the gearing as principal source of excitation in to the components of the 
power transmission. The instantaneous movements of each wheel (driving gear and driven gear) are 
represented by six liberty degrees, three translations, respectively, three rotations. In order to obtain 
the dynamic response, the mathematical model afferent to the vibrations with two liberty degrees is 
used. The mathematical model of the dynamic behavior of the gear was obtained in the Lagrange 
formalism. The discovering of the dynamic response is possible using the integral Laplace 
transform. This way, an algebra problem is in study, that facilitates, considerably, the integration of 
the linear systems of differential equations.

Balancing of a Slider-Crank Mechanism by Using a Counter Mass and a 
Progressive Spring with Two Rates

Keywords:  Slider-crank balancing, spring-balanced, progressive spring. 
Abstract. This paper investigates the possibility to individually balance the dynamic forces and 
moment that are characteristic to the slider-crank mechanism. The unbalanced forces that act on the 
frame which holds the slider-crank mechanism are known as shaking forces. Likewise, the 
unbalanced moment that acts on the frame is known as shaking moment. Because both force and 
moment are unbalanced, they cause vibrations on the entire machine that holds the mechanism. The 
most common mean of balancing the slider crank mechanism by using a counter mass. This is 
applied for most of the commercial mechanical devices that use the mechanism. However the nature 
of the mechanism does not allow perfect balancing in such a way. The different nature of motions 
that govern the slider and the crank imply that a counter mass can only statically balance the 
mechanism. Perfect dynamic balancing cannot be achieved this way. In this paper the excitations 
that act on the mechanism are split by the nature of motion that generates them and balanced 
accordingly. Therefore two motions are defined. The piston motion and the crank motion. The 
dynamic force associated to the crank motion is balanced with a dynamically equivalent system. The 
dynamic force associated with the piston motion is balanced by a progressive spring with two rates. 
Introduction 
The slider-crank mechanism is used in reciprocating machines found in household appliances 
and up to industrial applications. Some applications input mechanical power in order to generate 
heat or fluid power [1-3]. Considering these applications, energy is required for two main tasks. One 
is to displace working fluid and secondly to move the components of the slider-crank mechanism. 
Most reciprocating machines used for heating and ventilating use single-cylinder pumps [4]. This 
implies that the machine is greatly imbalanced and further leads to two consequences. The machine 
has a bad NVH (noise, vibration, harshness) behavior and the unbalanced components require 
additional energy in order to move e.g. the kinetic energy of the piston is poorly recovered. 
Therefore efficient balancing improves both NVH behavior and energy consumption. 
Most slider-crank mechanisms contain a counter mass connected to the crankshaft. The counter 
mass statically balances the slider-crank mechanism. A slowly moving slider-crank mechanism has 
weak dynamic loads compared to the static loads. Such a mechanism can be considered balanced 
when using a proper counter mass. Such a mechanism is statically balanced at any given position. A 
slider-crank with a connecting rod that is relative long to the crank can be balanced with a counter 
mass [5]. However the mechanism is subjected to dynamic loads in more than one direction. This 
occurs because the counter mass performs a circular motion, the connecting rod performs a planar 
motion and the piston assembly a linear motion. In addition, both motions of the connecting rod and 
piston assembly contain second degree harmonics that are not found in the motion of the counter 
mass [6]. Therefore when using a counter mass for the slider-crank the value of the mass is chosen 
in such a way that it is the best compromise between static balancing and dynamic balancing.  
If the specific motion of each component is considered, the mechanism can be analyzed as two 
separate parts which can be associated with the piston motion and crank motion. The piston motion 
has one degree of freedom (DOF) and it is defined by a fundamental harmonic and a second degree 
harmonic. The crank motion has also one DOF and is defined by the fundamental harmonic.

The inertia force of each component can be associated with the motion of the crank or the piston. 
In order to do so, the crank and the connecting rod are replaced with systems of concentrated masses 
that are dynamic equivalent to the original components. In order to have dynamic equivalence the 
components must be replaced with systems of concentrated masses that have the same [7]: center of 
mass, sum of the masses and moment of inertia relative to the axis (normal on the x0y plane, Fig. 1) 
that passes through the origin. 
The first force, Fx, comes from the piston assembly and the concentrated mass of the connecting 
rod at the slider joint [8]. The second force, Fy, comes from the crank and the concentrated mass of 
the connecting rod and crank at the crank joint. The second force comes from a mass that rotates 
around an axis. This force can be balanced by a dynamic equivalent system across the axis.  
The first force will be balanced with a progressive spring. Springs are widely used to recover 
energy of reciprocating components. E.g. springs for poppet valves of internal combustion engines. 
However, such applications do not balance the reciprocating masses. An attempt to balance the 
force of the reciprocating mass with a progressive spring will be further presented.  
A model of the slider-crank mechanism with counter mass and spring is defined. 
 
Fig. 1 Schematic of the slider-crank mechanism with spring and counter mass. 
Design of mechanism 
Each force that corresponds to a mass can be balanced individually. The force associated with the 
mass concentrated at the crank, Fy, is balanced with a counter-mass. The radius at which the counter 
mass is placed and the value of its mass define its dynamic behavior. If the counter mass is dynamic 
equivalent to the concentrated mass at the crank joint then Fy is balanced [8]. This equivalency can 
be easily achieved as:

where Fx is the force acting on the piston axis direction and mp is the mass of the piston assembly 
and the concentrated mass of the connecting rod at the slider joint. 
As seen in Fig. 1, the spring displacement is equal to the piston displacement. The spring force is 
always dependent to spring displacement [9]. The piston acceleration (Eq. 4) and the inertia force 
(Eq. 5) are crankshaft angle dependent. To identify an ideal characteristic for the spring, the inertia 
force (Eq. 5) must be defined relative to the piston displacement. Fig. 2 displays two graphs of Fx.  
 
Fig. 2 Fx relative to piston displacement (left) and Fx relative to crankshaft angle (right). 
A few observations are made regarding the curve from the left graph in Fig. 2.  
a. The force is null at a displacement of x1 which is different to the midpoint between TDC (top 
dead center) and BDC (bottom dead center).  
b. At TDC the absolute value of Fx is greater than at BDC.  
c. The maximum value of Fx is reached before BDC. 
d. The curve profile is similar to the typical Stress-strain curve for steel [10]. 
e. The value of Fx at BDC is also reached at x`. 
A spring with a characteristic that overlaps the curve from Fig 2 can balance Fx. Applying 
observations c and d for such a spring indicate that a regular spring would operate beyond yield 
strength. Repeated operations for such a spring would lead to material fatigue. One alternative is to 
use a progressive string. A progressive spring can have a similar characteristic and still operate with 
respect to Hooke’s law. A progressive spring with two rates is considered.

Observation a. indicates that the progressive spring must be at its free length, L0, when the piston 
is at x1. Observation b. indicates that the absolute value of the spring force must be greater when the 
piston is at TDC than at BDC. To overlap the Fx curve the spring rate must decrease as the piston 
gets closer to BDC. The spring from Fig. 3 is further considered.  
 
Fig. 3 Progressive spring with two rates. 
The left part of the spring has a rate of k2. It is preloaded is such a way that it extends only after 
the spring length is greater than L1. Such a behavior is obtained by preloading the part at solid 
length. For this part the spring pitch is equal to the spring wire diameter. The right part of the spring 
can be compressed or extended. Its spring rate, k1, is different than k2. 
The spring deflection, δ, is defined relative to its free length at any given position:

Two cases are considered in order to define the spring behavior. The first case applies when the 
spring length is less than L1. In this case the spring force, Fs, is defined as:

The second case applies when the spring length is greater than L1. For the deflection which is 
beyond L1 the force increases at a different rate. Both spring parts get active and behave as springs 
that are connected in series. The combined rate is defined as:

When the spring is extend beyond L1 the force is defined by two terms. The first term represents 
the force required to extend the spring up to L1 (Eq. 8). Because the spring gets extended beyond L1, 
L can be replaced with L1 in the first term. The first term is also equal to the preload, Fp. The second 
term represents the force to extend the spring beyond L1. The relation containing both terms is:

Example  
Fx and Fy are calculated for an up-to-date mechanical device considering its nominal parameters.  
The counter mass is defined according to Eq. 1. This ensures complete balancing of Fy and the 
shaking moment that is generated by Fy. 
In order to balance Fx, values must be calculated for the spring rates and an arbitrarily value must 
be considered for the preload. Considering observation a. and Fig. 3 from the previous chapter, the 
spring must be at free length when the piston is at x1. By traveling towards TDC from x1, the spring 
compresses. The curve section between x1 and TDC from the left graph in Fig. 2 is approximated as 
straight. Accordingly a spring rate that generates the same characteristic is defined as: 
1
1
x
x
F
k
x
−
=
, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(11) 
where the value of Fx is considered at TDC. 
When the piston travels from x1 towards BDC the spring extends. The spring force continues to 
develop linear until the spring reaches L1. L1 is determined by the preload, Fp. 
The spring rate of the right part must define the spring characteristic in such a way that it has the 
same value at BDC as Fx. Considering the spring force equal to Fx at BDC the spring rate becomes:  
(
)
1

0

=
k
L
L
k
F
L
L
k

.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(12) 
Thus, k2 depends on the value of L1. According to Eq. 8 and observation e. the next condition is 
imposed. The value of L1 should not drive the spring force, as in Eq. 8, greater than Fx at BDC nor 
should occur after the piston reaches x`. Therefore L1 has been arbitrarily chosen at midpoint 
between x1 and the point where Fs would reach the value of Fx at BDC according to Eq. 8. 
The spring characteristic cannot perfectly overlap Fx and therefore the slider-crank mechanism 
partially balanced. The unbalanced shaking force generates also generates shaking moment, T. The 
shaking moment occurs because the shaking force also acts on the crank. The distance between the 
crank and the x axis (Fig. 1) acts as displacement vector for the torque.

Conclusions 
The shaking forces of the slider-crank mechanism that act normal on the piston axis were 
balanced by solving equation 1 for a dynamic equivalent system of concentrated masses. 
The shaking force and shaking moment caused by the reciprocating mass were be reduced by 
implementing a progressive spring with two rates such as in Fig. 3. 
The counter mass in accordance and the progressive spring were calculated for an up-to-date 
device that uses a slider-crank mechanism. This resulted in reducing the shaking forces that act 
parallel with the slider axis with 88 % and reduced shaking moment by 78%. 
This paper enables further investigation to verify if the design of such a slider-crank mechanism 
and progressive spring is feasible from a constructive point of view.

Abstract. This paper presents new formulations on the higher order motion energies that are applied 
in the dynamic study of multibody mechanical systems in keeping with the researches of the main 
author. The analysis performed in this paper highlights the importance of motion energies of higher 
order in the study of dynamic behavior of fast moving mechanical systems, as well as in transient 
phase of motion. In these situations, are developed higher order time variations of the linear and 
angular accelerations. As a result, in the final part of this paper is presented an application that 
emphasizes this essential dynamic aspect regarding the higher order acceleration energies. 
Introduction 
This paper is structured in three main parts. In the first part are presented the kinematical 
parameters necessary to determine the acceleration energies of higher order, the latter representing 
the object of the second part. In the final part of this paper is presented an application that 
experimentally underlines the variation in time of the angular accelerations, while the other 
parameters have resulted by applying polynomial interpolating functions of fifth order. The obtained 
results are substituted in the expressions for the acceleration energies of first, second and third 
order, customized for this application, pointing out their variation in time. 
 
Kinematical parameters 
According to the research of the main author [5,6,7] , the acceleration energies are established in 
general form, thus the kinematical parameters, as constituent components of these energies, are 
defined considering a multibody system (MBS) of n bodies (
)
iS , where = →
1
i
n . Each rigid body 
(see Fig. 1) is assumed to perform a general motion without any kinematical constraints. Therefore, 
the kinematical parameters that define the resultant rotation motion of a rigid body (
)
iS  are:

Remark: The expressions of the linear and angular absolute kinematical parameters previously 
presented which refer to the motion of each rigid body, component of the MBS, are determined 
either by classical transformations, or by using the matrix exponential functions (see [3,4,7]). The 
obtained results are forward used in the expressions of the acceleration energies which are the 
subject of the next section. 
 
Acceleration energies of higher order 
 
According to the scientific literature [1,2,8,9,10], in 1879, Gibbs defines the differential equations 
of motion, on which, in 1899, Paul Appell performs a detailed study. As a result of this study were 
deduced the equations known as Gibbs-Appell which are applied for holonomic and nonholonomic 
systems where the role of the kinetic energy was substituted by the acceleration energy also known as 
Appell’s function or kinetic energy of acceleration [8]. If in the mentioned studies, the acceleration 
energy was defined for a system of material points, in the paper [4] of the main author, the acceleration 
energy was established in a generalized form corresponding to a MBS and it was named acceleration 
energy of first order. The starting equation for defining the acceleration energy of first order is:

It can be seen that the expression (9) in explicit form is a generalization of König’s theorem extended 
on the acceleration energies of first order. According to the research of the main author [4,5,6], the fast 
moving MBS, the transient motion phases, as well as the mechanical systems subjected to the action of a 
system of external forces with a time variation law, are characterized by linear and angular accelerations 
of higher order. Therefore, according to [5,6] the higher order acceleration energies are developed, among 
which the acceleration energies of second and third order are presented in explicit form. The starting 
equation for the acceleration energy of second order (see Fig.1) is:

The expression (16) is a generalization of the König’s theorem extended in this case on the 
accelerations energy of third order.  
Remark: In the expressions (9), (13) and (16), representing the higher order energies, the 
generalized variables 
( )
iq t  have been included along with their higher order derivatives. The 
variables univocally express the mechanical motion of the MBS.   
 
Application 
 
In order to illustrate in an experimental form the validity of the above presented expressions, 
regarding the higher order acceleration energies, it was considered the rotation motion on the 
angular interval (
)
π
0,
 of the arm of a serial robot Fanuc LR Mate 100 iB (Fig. 2).  
By using a mono-axial accelerometer, it has been experimentally established the variation in time 
of the tangential component of the acceleration of a point belonging to the robot arm (see Fig. 3). 
Considering the rotation motion of the arm, it results in a graphical form the time variation law for 
the angular acceleration 
( )
τ
3q
 (according to Fig. 3).

Conclusions 
 
The present paper was dedicated to the presentation of some new formulations regarding the 
analytical dynamics of the MBS. Considering the researches of the main author, the expressions for 
the acceleration energies of first, second and third order have been presented in general and explicit 
form. They are an extension of König’s theorem on higher order energies being characterized by a 
resultant translation component and resultant rotation component. The existence of these higher 
order energies, according to scientific literature is due to the fact that when a component of the 
MBS or the MBS is characterized by rapid movements, there are higher order time variations of the 
linear and angular accelerations. This conclusion is also valid for the transient motion phase of any 
mechanical system. The fundamental role of higher order energies is found in the differential 
motion equations of higher order (as shown in other papers of the authors).

Abstract. Using the main author's researches on the energies of acceleration and higher order 
equations of motion, this paper is devoted to new formulations in analytical dynamics of mechanical 
multibody systems (MBS). Components of multibody mechanical systems, or the serial robots parts 
are presenting rapid movements or transitory motion, which developing higher order variations in 
respect to time of linear and angular accelerations. According to research of the main author, they 
are integrated into higher order energies and these in differential equations of motion in higher 
order, which will lead to variations in time of generalized forces which dominate these types of 
mechanical systems. The establishing of these differential equations of motion, it is based on a 
generalization of a principle of analytical differential mechanics, known as the D`Alembert – 
Lagrange Principle. 
Introduction 
The paper is focused on a few formulations, based on main author research on advanced 
dynamics of multibody systems, when they are characterized by rapid movements (acceleration 
greater then g ), and the transitory motions. It demonstrates theoretical and experimental the 
existing of variations in acceleration energy and generalized forces. According to main author 
research, they are integrated into higher order energies and these differential equations of motion in 
higher order, which will lead to variations in time of generalized forces which dominating these 
types of mechanical systems.  
This paper consisting in three main parts as: formulations regarding the D`Alembert – Lagrange 
Principle, higher order differential equations of motion, and experimental modeling. 
Formulations regarding the D`Alembert–Lagrange Principle 
According to the literature [1], [2], the general principles underlying the entire analytical 
dynamics are: virtual displacement principle, the principle of D`Alembert, which is known as the 
principle of virtual mechanic work , specific to dynamic behavior of mechanical systems . The 
classical form of this principle, for a discrete system of material points is:

jq , jq  and jq  are generalized variables which univocally characterizes the motion of system. 
In Fig. 1 is considered in symbolic form a MBS consisting of ( )
n  bodies. In the general case, 
every rigid body is considered as having a general movement, not being subordinated to kinematic 
constraints.

When the mechanical system is dominated by exterior forces characterized by a certain variation 
law in relation to time, the existence of higher order energies is noticed [7, 8, 9]. So, applying a 
series of complex matrix and differential transformations on D’Alembert – Lagrange’s principle, the 
main author proposes the following development for the motion equations of higher order:

order, which will lead to the establishment of the generalized driving forces (dynamic control 
functions) of second and third which govern MBS’s motion mainly during transitory motion phases.

Conclusions 
This paper presented new formulations on differential motions equations that are used in the 
advanced dynamic study of multibody mechanical systems, when they are characterized by rapid 
movements (acceleration greater then g ), as well as transitory motions. This states, are 
characterized by existence of the higher order variations with respect to time of linear and angular 
accelerations, which according to main author research, they are integrated into higher order 
energies and these differential equations of motion leading to variations in time of generalized 
forces which dominating these types of mechanical systems. It have been presented generally the 
dynamics equations of motion for any type of multibody mechanical system. The establishing of 
these differential equations of motion was based on generalization of a principle of analytical 
mechanics, known as the D`Alembert – Lagrange Principle. Therefore, all these studies were 
developed by the first author, they leading to a more precise control on the transitory motion phases 
of the mutibody mechanical systems.

Keywords: planar mechanism, circular translation motion, cylindrical gear, kinematic scheme 
 
Abstract: The curve line translation motion can be generated in the particular form of the circular 
translation, through mono-mobile mechanisms with articulated links of simple parallelogram type 
(with a fixed side) or through transmission with toothed belt with a fixed wheel. Also, the circular 
translation can be generated through planar mechanisms with two cylindrical gears with a fixed 
central wheel. It is mentioned that the two cylindrical gearings of the Fergusson mechanisms are 
both exterior and interior.  
 
Introduction 
 
Curve line translation motion, in particular circular translation, can be generated by means of 
planar mechanisms with articulated links [1, 3, 4, 7] such as the articulated parallelogram (fig. 1), or 
by means of planar mechanisms with cylindrical gears [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9] such as the Fergusson 
mechanism (fig. 2).  
With the planar mechanism of the articulated parallelogram type (fig. 1), the reciprocating rod 2 
does a circular translation motion as the velocities of points A and B are equal, which can be 
noticed by maintaining the segment AB in a parallel position to itself.

The circular translation motion in auxiliary mechanisms of motor vehicles  
 
a. Doors closing / opening mechanism without hinges  
 
The doors of some modern buses no longer contain hinges, and they are actuated by means of 
the articulated parallelogram mechanism (fig. 3) in which the door side MN is one with the 
reciprocating rod AB of this planar mechanism.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 3. Kinematic scheme of the mechanism  
Fig. 4. Kinematic scheme of the  
           used for actuating the bus door 
 
 
           windshield wiper 
 
The kinematic scheme of the parallelogram mechanism (fig. 3) is presented by means of a 
continuous line in an intermediate position (when the door side MN is outside the bus), and by 
means of a dotted line in the extreme closing (right) and opening (left) positions. 
The mechanism is pneumatically driven by means of an actuator situated below, under the bus 
platform, at the same level with the stairs used by passengers to go on and off the bus. 
 
b. The windshield wiper mechanism 
 
The parallelogram mechanism is used as windshield wiper (fig. 4) for urban buses, where the 
wiping shim is fixed in the MN position perpendicular to the reciprocating rod AB in a point 
situated to the right of the AB segment.  
The kinematic scheme of the parallelogram mechanism (fig. 4) is shown in three distinct 
positions, of which the extreme position to the right is represented by a continuous line, and the 
other two positions (middle and left) are represented by means of a dotted line. 
This mechanism is usually electrically driven by means of an equalizing rod – crank mechanism. 
This type of parallelogram mechanism with a fixed small edge is used for the doors of motor 
vehicles in terms of a crane to lift / lower the glass.  
The reciprocating rod of such a parallelogram does a circular translation motion, and by means 
of some rollers, gets into contact with the glass frame, which is vertically guided.  
This kind of mechanism is driven manually or electrically by means of a cylindrical gear having 
a large multiplication ration, placed inside or outside, which ensures a certain self-locking degree 
with regard to the intention of actuating from the led element to the leading one. 
 
Geometry and kinematics of the Fergusson planar mechanism 
 
The Fergusson planar mechanism (fig. 2, 5) consists of three geared wheels to the outside (1, 2, 
3) placed in a series, articulated in points O, A and B on the planet wheel carrier p, which does a 
translation motion around the fixed point O.  
Providing that the distances between the axes of the wheels 1 and 2, respectively 2 and 3 are 
equal (OA = AB), the gear wheels 1 and 3 have equal diameters, and the same number of teeth (z1 = 
z3). 
If gear wheel 1 is fixed by means of blocking (fig. 2, 5), then point C becomes the instantaneous 
rotation centre of gear wheel 2, with a null velocity (Cc=0).

For one rotation of the planet wheel carrier p at an angular velocity ω, points A and B have 
velocities in the ratio OA/OB = 1/ 2.  The distribution of velocities (fig. 2) on the gear wheel 2 is 
obtained by uniting the point a (the peak of the A point velocity) with point C whose velocity is 
null.  
Point d, peak of the velocity of point D, is located on the extension of the ac segment, so that the 
ratio of the velocities of points A and D is CA/CD = 1/ 2. For the velocities of points A, B, C and D 
we can define the ratios (fig. 2, 5):

wheel 3 are equal, which determines

, so gear wheel 3 does a circular translation motion.  
The same conclusion may be obtained by means of the analytic method, writing the relative 
transmittal ratios provided the planet wheel carrier p does not move:

New cylindrical planar mechanisms for generating circular translation motion  
 
A new kinematic scheme (fig. 5b) is obtained starting from the Fergusson planar mechanism 
(fig. 5a), where the interim gear wheel 2 has been replaced by two joint and several gear wheels 2 
and 2’ with different radii. 
Let us consider the formula (5) which is now written as

Relation (7) can be checked by means of the graphical method of the linear velocities

D

Considering the distribution of linear velocities (fig. 6) we notice that the equivalence

A smaller gauge alternative of the kinematic scheme presented above (fig. 5b) is obtained if the 
gear wheel 3 gears with the gear wheel 2’ on the same side of the 
2
∆axis with the exterior gear 
mechanism (1,2) (fig. 6).

The position of the ∆3 axis, correspondingly of point B , is obtained by means of the 
distribution of velocities Oa  and Ca , depending on the position of point D .  
Thus, knowing the vector Dd  with 
Ca
d ∈

velocity where the parallel line from d to OA meets Oa .

From point we draw a parallel line to the reference line OA till it crosses the extension of the 
Oa  segment in point b . Thus we obtain on the drawing (fig. 7b) the OB segment, positioning the 
mobile axis of the satellite wheel 3 with interior dents, which does a circular translation motion.  
As an application (fig. 8), a building model (an operational scale model) provided with planetary 
spur gears was projected and created, this model enables visualising the circular translational 
motion. 
 
Conclusions 
 
The curve line translation motion can be generated in the particular form of circular translation, 
by means of mono-mobile mechanisms with articulated links of the simple parallelogram type (with 
a fixed side) or by means of transmissions with a toothed belt with a fixed wheel.  
Also, circular translation can be generated through planar mechanisms with two cylindrical gears 
with a fixed central wheel. It is mentioned that the two cylindrical gearings of the Fergusson 
mechanisms are both exterior and interior.  
The general form of the curve line translation is obtained by means of planar bi-mobile 
manipulating mechanisms with articulated links, auxiliary kinematic chains mounted in parallel 
with the main kinematic chain. 
A building model, an operational scale model, provided with planetary spur gears was created, 
which enables visualising the circular translational motion. 
This operational model (fig. 8) is a Ferguson type mechanism. It has the advantage of being 
more compact and may be put to use in theme parks.

Keywords: the movements of the plants, the projection of the trajectory, flows of compressed air 
Abstract. The current paper presents an experimental study of the movements of plants, as well as 
various conclusions of the research. The main idea is that the general movement of a plant under the 
action of the wind is a very complex one, and it can be studied within the research for creating 
mechanical systems based on the same principles.  
Introduction 
Generally, the human joint movement data are collected with different acquisition systems, are 
extracted, analyzed and are represented as temporal diagrams representing specific joint measures 
during the gait cycle [1-3]. The experimental methods used for data acquisition and kinematical 
analysis of the human movements are also used in the case of the robotic structures. The numerical 
results can be compared with results obtained from various analytical or experimental methods in 
order to certify a correct mechanical model [1–3].   
The complex movements of the plants consist of elastic deformations of their branches and of 
vibrating movements of their leaves.  
The air around the plant is in a constant state of motion variable, depending on the size and 
direction of the airflow acting in a particular area of the plant. Plant leaves are moving under the 
action of air jets with varying pressure and elasticity due to leaf petioles, they bend in the opposite 
direction of the airflow 
Under the action of a well-determined system of forces, a plant has got an established movement. 
The actual methods of calculus which are used in engineering do not allow the determination of the 
real movements of a plant through calculus, as neither the mechanical, nor the resisting 
characteristics of the different components of the plants are known. [4] 
However, studying the movement of a plant under the action of various flows of compressed air, 
controlled in terms of direction and size, allows the establishment of certain principles which could 
have technical applicability. 
Experimental research for plant castan 
The paper contains the filming of the movement of a plant upon which compressed air from a 
pneumatical installation has been acted. The compressor had the maximum volume of air of 30cm3 
and the maximum pressure of 5 bars. For leading the air flow, a metallic support with possibilities 
of translation and rotation after two perpendicular axes has been used.[5] 
In order to extract them from the video folder a video editing program was used. In order to have 
more precise images they were imported in Autocad. The curves presenting the projections of the 
points were done using Microsoft Excel. An XOY coordinate system was attached to each image 
and used to measure the coordinate of the dots.  
Two points were marked on the plant and their movement was continuously followed. The 
position of the points is given below each graphic, that is point 1 through coordinates X1, Y1, point 
2 through coordinates X2, Y2 and the time from the beginning of the movement  in second (point 1 
is the one above). Second 30 from the beginning of the test were used for the study.

The study was done during a second divided in 25 frames so as to measure precisely the 
movement of the two dots. In the analysed second there were noticed 3 different stages of 
movement. In the first frames the leaves were blown by the air flow (Fig. 1,2).

Under the air flow the leaves vibrate with a frequency bigger than 0.04 seconds a fact 
highlighted by the camera which cannot capture a clear image of the leaves (Fig. 2), especially the 
leave down on the right. It should be noticed that the movement of this plant is generally done by 
leaves vibrating and not moving. The stem does not move but takes over the vibrations of the leaves 
through the stalk. 
Actionated by the air flow the leaves are in a position of balance and they only have vibrating 
movements. The stalk of the leaves of this plant is under a bigger force of the leaves. 
These observations highlight that the movement of a plant under air flow is directly influenced 
more by the nature of the wood material and less by the size of the surface of the leaves.   
 
The vibrating movement is clearly shown throughout many frames. The only leaf that has a 
bigger movement is the one on the top which has the stalk as a continuation of the stem.

All these values show that the movement of the plants is very complex similar to vibrating 
movements, but aleatory, uncontrolled. 
Conclusion 
Specialty literature is focused on the botanic direction and the physiology of plants but does not 
refer to the biomechanic aspects regarding plant movement. 
Using experiments it was noticed that the movement of the plants under the action of external 
factors depends on the physiology of the plants and the shape of the component parts.  
The plants studied had a similar behavior different only on what the mechanic and physical 
characteristics of the plants are concerned: the longitudinal elasticity modulus and transverse 
elasticity modulus of the plant, the size of the stem, the arrangement, number, surface and thickness 
of the leaves. 
After stopping the action of the external factors the plants have the tendency to come back to the 
initial position.

Model for the motion of misaligned shafts with elastic plate coupling 
Hariton POPARAD 
Transilvania University of Brașov, 29 Eroilor Bvd., 500036 Brașov, Romania 
Keywords: plate coupling, structure, misaligned shafts, FEM. 
Abstract. Using the MathCAD software, this publication aims to develop a novel model to interpret 
the analytical results for an elastic structure as a substitute to flexible coupling between two 
misaligned axes. This model is used for the analysis of the motion of two deformed components 
comprising of the cardan joint, as well as the coupling with elastic plates. 
Introduction 
Elastic coupling enables the power transfer between two misaligned axes, but as a result 
experiences severe anatomical elastic deformation. These indicate what a hypoid rigid gear achieves 
through a combination of rolling with a slipping motion [1,3]. Essentially, the elastic coupling 
behaves in the same manner as the flexible element complexly stressed, as indicated in Fig.1.  
 
 
Fig. 1. The elastic coupling is represented as a flexible element  
ax0 – input shaft; ax1 – output shaft; C – loaded flexible element (force F and torque M) 
The elastic coupling enables the uniform rotation of the input shaft to be converted into a 
non-uniform rotation exhibited in the output shaft. Loaded only at the connecting nodes to the fixed 
axes, the points are designated as 0 and 1. The equilibrium of this connecting system is represented in 
the mathematical relationship:

Taking into consideration terms of inertia and shaft offsets, the dynamic equilibrium becomes 
visibly more complex. Represented in only one of the 6 coordinate endings, the torque of 
transmission is derived from the relationship of two screws, decomposed in bases Ri , existing in static 
equilibrium [4,5].

When interpreted in a linear model, the transversal elements appear linear in both the 
instantaneous snapshot of the offsetting coordinates, as well as the image resulting from the axial load 
as a consequence of torsional stress.  
Due to the complexity of studying the reaction of distorted structures, especially one in which we 
used 3D binodal elastic elements, the results at static equilibrium yielded values which would 
substantially modify the findings of this study. In an effort to determine a reliable, significant 
relationship, the data was not included in this paper.  
Coupling model  
Using the torsion rigidity parameter, which determines the input and the output shaft rotation angle φn 
at applied torsion Mtn [2,3], the properties of the flexible couplings are defined. Thus, Fig.2 presents 
the components of flexible coupling with elastic curved plates.  
    
 
Fig. 2. The coupling with elastic plates: 1- input shaft; 
2, 3, 8, 10 – curved plates on contour; 6 – output shaft; 4, 5, 12, 13 – bolt; 7, 11, 9 - spacer 
Fig.3 shows two models, using MathCAD software, of couplings with binodal elements. We 
proved that it is sufficient to use the simplest elements, for the assembled structures to be 
homomorphous with the analysed couplings. Although the simplest elements help to develop the 
elastic image of these couplings and establish the forces in the joints, their reaction in terms of 
displacement remains at a qualitative level and is used as a first approximation.

Fig. 3. The cardan (3 and 4 flexible elements), and  
 elastic plate coupling (3, 4, 5, 6 flexible elements), math models 
We used another BEAM element to serve as the special curved plate element to which bending and 
traction stresses were applied by linking a series of three elements (curved and straight bars) within a 
single element [4,5]. 
The cardan coupling model includes a planar input fork with 5 elements. This will support elastic 
elements 3 and 4, restrained in the node 4, as joint cross origin.  
The elastic plate coupling has a similar input shaft incident in nodes 3 and 5. The elastic 
connection with the output fork is achieved by the four elastic elements 3 through 6 placed on the 
contour. The plane yOz will make the connection between the two shafts.

For the cardan coupling model, the incidence of the input shaft in nodes 3 and 5, is achieved by a 
finite rotation of angle β0 around the Oy axis. Similarly, the finite rotation β1 of the secondary shaft 
around the Oz axis will be compatible with the coupling in the cross vertical elements.   
The same modeling approach for the elastic plate coupling. The input fork is incidence on nodes 3 
and 5 with the β0 angle around Oy axis, and the exit fork achieved through the elastical rotation of the 
angle β1 around the axis of nodes 4 and 6. 
We can directly model images of the distorted coupling structures, but analysing this class of 
models. The distorted structure of the cardan coupling was plotted in Fig.4, by blocking exit node1’s 
six degrees of freedom. The applied load of the coupling will be applied in the node 0, either by 
torque Mo, or by elementary rotation θ0. Thus, confirming the similitude in retransmission of both 
loading modes.  
In Fig.4 the freedom specific to the kinematic couples of the cardan coupling is introduced. The 
slip in node 3 and 7, and the torsion of the cross elements, were all achieved by removing the rigidity 
associated with the degree of freedom of the element compatible with the kinematic couple.

Fig. 5. Elastic plates coupling, deformed model 
The analysis, conducted on the elastic plates coupling (Fig.5), was carried out by blocking the last 
element of the exit fork and introducing the load through the torque on the element 0 direction. The 
nodal displacements and the internal and external linking forces were subsequently established. 
BEAM elements were placed on this structure by enclosing the afferent nodes. The ball jointed 
elements couplings will be analyzed using TRUSS elements.  
In Fig.6 a special element is presented, the elastic plate with a non-linear (NL) characteristic, 
locally linearized by rigidity KS.  The study associated with this element is developed in the reduced 
models below.

where the static condensation node of the universal coupling O was removed. As a direct result, the 
rigidities of the elastic coupling among the two rigid shafts denoted in C could be acquired.

K represents the rigidity of the connected cross elements through positional incidence. Σ matrix, the 
expanded incidence, denotes the universal coupling found in Fig. 7 (the connecting line of the four 
elements to node 0 reaching the origin of the cross is the expansion of the identical 4 x 4 matrix).  
By eliminating the unloaded node O ≡ C as the constitutional origin of the universal coupling 
cross, the rigidity matrix K11 (12,12) resulted. This is equivalent to flexible link between the two 
rigid crosses, each containing dual displacement screws δi,i =1,2, [5].

Using the global notation system, the translation is represented in the top and the generator in the 
bottom equation (6). δ, the elementary displacement, is fragmented in the oblique base [a0, a1, a0 x 
a1], which was built on the versors of the input and output axes respectively. In the case that the two 
axes are misaligned, the term δ n ≠0  will represent the directory circle in the transversal plane which 
is orthogonal on the input axis ao in the relative motion with respect to the reference system fixed on 
the input fork.  
Although fixed in the absolute system, the center of the flexible cross is no longer a fixed origin 
with respect to this relative system.  
Built as a singular rigidity matrix, K11 represents two responses associated with the coupling as an 
unloaded rigid. The rigidity of the elastic link of the input shaft to the fixed output shaft KEC is 
derived from the first diagonal cell (6,6) . This is found in relation (7), and it is independent of the 
uniform bending rigidity factor 2 (E. Iy / L3).  
As expected from the diagonal structure, origin C overlaps with the elastic center, making the 
global reference system principal to the coupling rigidity along which the flexibility is uniformly 
distributed. In convergence with the cardan coupling in the finite, as observed in the elementary 
reference system, compatibility with rotations θy, θz  is also noted.  
Numerical results 
The rigidity is the elastic operator in the screw space, relation (7).

The numerical representation displays the ability of the proposed mathematical model to be used 
as a tool for predicting the flexible coupling with elastic plates for technical solutions for the 
assemblies between misaligned axes.  
Summary 
In summary, we conclude that: 
 To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no work has been presented on coupling modeling with 
elastic curved plate behavior performing transmission of the power between random axes;  
 The four elastic curved plates of the coupling were simulated as equivalent elastic shafts; 
 The properties of the equivalent shaft of the cardan coupling are that they are perfectly 
flexible, finitely torsional, axial, and have cross offsetting flexibility;  
 The contour displayed, derived from the shaft associated with coupling the elastic curved 
plate elements, is flexible in any direction of the offsetting screw and is permanently coupled 
with a twisted curve as a deformed version;  
 The free connecting shaft of the two couplings displayed in Fig. 2 generated the axial pumping 
phenomenon. This is believed to be the right technical solution;  
 It is important to note that if a single elastic couple is imposed for technical reasons, the 
misalignment limits the support from the coupling. As a result, the coupling must be 
dimensioned to correct the discrepancy. In these select cases, the elastic shaft attached to the 
coupling can be denoted as a tool for analysis.

Keywords: Adjustable centrifugal driving, function, class, driving mechanism.  
Abstract. The paper deals with constructive and functional elements of an adjustable coupling with 
friction disks and adjustable driving planar mechanisms. The paper shows few conceptual and 
functional principles, introduces a new function for couplings and a new class of centrifugal 
couplings. It also presents structural elements of an innovative constructive solution of a centrifugal 
clutch with friction disks and adjustable centrifugal driving.  
Introduction  
Couplings are machine parts or functionally equivalent mechanical systems. Those realize the 
connection between two consequent elements of a kinematical chain. The goal of such connection is 
to transmit the power (torque and revolution motion) and is done, in most cases, without modifying 
the kinematical functions.  
The centrifugal clutches are included into the category of mechanical intermittent automatic 
clutches [1, 2].  
The torque transmission by using the centrifugal force is the main characteristic of centrifugal 
clutches. One or more clutch’s parts are driven into a rotational motion due to the driving semi-
clutch. The centrifugal elements participate directly (like at the clutches with rims) or indirectly 
(like at the clutches activated by centrifugal force) in the transmission of torque. In all cases, the 
centrifugal forces generate a pressing force between friction parts (rims, disks etc.) and the 
conjugated friction surfaces. The pressing force produces friction and by its mean the torque is 
transmitted to the driven semi-clutch.  
The constructive solution that will be described in the paper presents a clutch with friction disks 
and centrifugal driving.  
Moreover, the solution presented next belongs to a new class of couplings: clutches with 
adjustable centrifugal driving [2].  
Some aspects concerning the optimization issues followed during the design process of this kind 
of couplings are also presented.  
Conceptual and Functional Principles  
The literature review highlighted widespread use of centrifugal clutches. They are present in 
transmissions of facilities and equipment used in many industries. Analysis of data obtained after 
bibliographic research allowed to setup specific aspects of centrifugal clutches [1, 2]. Also, studying 
the existing classifications and couplings’ features, eight main basic features could be identified. 
Those main functions are: f0 - carrying the load (motion/rotation and torque); f1 - motion command 
and control; f2 - load limit; f3 - protection of transmission and equipment against shocks and 
vibrations; f4 - compensation of errors appeared during making of and/or assembling; f5 - parallel or 
concurrent shafts’ mounting allowance; f6 - speed limit; f7 - one way motion’s allowance. The basic 
function f0, which is the main being reason of couplings, is common to all types of couplings. 
Centrifugal clutches fulfill only some of the eight main functions (f0, f1, f2, f3, f6 and f7).

There are known constructive solutions of centrifuged clutches or clutches activated by 
centrifugal force, but all these present the inconvenience of strictly dependence, mainly, between 
torque values, on one hand and functional revolution speed and/or masses of centrifuged parts, on 
the other hand. Sometimes, industrial activities ask for more flexible dependences like those 
mentioned above. Unfortunately, in all constructive solutions known before, the shifting of that 
dependence, if any, requests to turn off the transmission and/or to disassemble the clutch.  
Based on the concept of couplings’ main functions and in the way to discard or decrease the 
dependences expressed right before, a brand new function for couplings has been state: the 
adjustment of transmitted torque. Thus, the strictly dependence of the clutch’s level of performance 
(the value of transmitted torque) by the operating revolution speed and/or the active centrifuged 
mass, can be significant decreased. It also means that a new class of couplings has been identified.  
In range of this new class of couplings more constructive solutions have been designed [2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7]. Some of them [4, 5] uses new and original conceptual, functional and constructive 
principles: the adjustment of the torque transmitted by the clutch; the multiplication of the main 
actively centrifugal force.  
Elements of Designing a Safety Clutch with Adjustable Centrifugal Driving  
The constructive solution [5], which will be presented in this paper, makes possible the 
adjustment of the torque value into a length interval, without dismantling the clutch.  
Inside of active/action centrifuged weights, centrifugal forces grow up and they will be called 
main actively centrifugal force. Withal, an original constructive principle was applied: this clutch 
uses planar motion mechanisms with levers for multiplying main actively force. These levers have 
the ratio of the arms higher than one; so, they are designed to multiply the main centrifugal driving 
force. Therefore, the final result is an increase of useful pressing force, called working force, among 
the friction elements (friction disks). This functional and constructive principle and driven 
mechanisms allow one the following advantages: the reduction of total active driving centrifuged 
weight while the performance level of the coupling (transmitted torque) remains the same or, for a 
certain value of active driving centrifuged weight, the coupling offer a higher level of performance. 
These advantages depend only by the effective/total amplification ratio of driving mechanisms, 
value which is set by the constructive dimensions exclusively. On the other hand, the adjustment 
capability somehow reduces the strictly dependence among performance level (the value of 
transmitted torque), constructive parameters (dimensions, active centrifuged weight, used friction 
materials etc.) and functional parameters (mainly on duty revolution speed).  
So, a certain constructive solution [5], allows both the advantage of adjustment (inside a finite 
gap) of the transmitted torque for a certain on duty revolution speed and also the advantage of 
achievement of a certain value of the transmitted torque for a finite gap of on duty revolution speed.  
The only disadvantage of this kind of clutches comes from a higher constructively complexity.  
The designer of each mechanical transmission has to be aware to its particular constructive and 
operational characteristics.  
Depending on the aspects mentioned before and the designer’s interests, it can be considered that 
the disadvantage of this kind of clutch is almost balanced by its advantages.  
The figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 show kinematics and structure of the clutch and also detail its 
conceptual and functional principles. The parts numbering is the same in all figures.  
First, the Fig. 1 shows the structural scheme of a planar driving mechanism with multiplying 
lever, in the particular situation of “taking out” from the functional assembly. In Fig. 1, active 
clutch’s parts can be identified: the driving centrifuged active weight 8 with its bolt 9, the pushing 
piston 12 with its bolt 13 (which ensure the mutual pressing among the friction disks 15 and 16) and 
the lever 10 from the amplifying mechanisms. In these mechanisms, the “base” role is played by the 
driving semi-coupling 1 (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). The driving semi-coupling 1 spins around its axis 
(see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) which is outside of the driving mechanism. This rotation of whole driving 
72

mechanism around an external axis produces a centrifugal force into the centrifuged active weight. 
Is good to know that the clutch contains a number of driving mechanisms. These planar mechanisms 
are disposed, relatively to coupling axis, on radial directions and with equal angles between.  
Based on structural scheme of a driving planar mechanism, the structural and functional scheme 
of the entire coupling was designed. This scheme (Fig. 3) allows: an overview of the clutch; the 
understanding how the clutch, generally and the driving planar mechanisms, particularly, works; the 
identification of the two main parts of the clutch and also the main subassemblies of the clutch (the 
friction disks subassembly and the driving mechanisms subassembly). Also, the scheme from Fig. 3 
allows a briefly description of an innovative constructive solution [5].

Fig. 3 Structural and functional scheme of the clutch 
 
The conducting semi-coupling presents a complex structure being built of the conducting hub 1, 
the housing 3, the grooved ring 4 and lid 5. These are solidly locked by means of some bolts. The 
conducting disk 6 is machined with radial channels that permit the motion of weights 8. This takes 
place towards a radial direction, to exterior, under the effect of centrifugal forces and to interior, 
under the effect of a retuning coil spring.  
The weights 8 together with their bolts 9 and the levers 10 realize a complex joint; the weights 8 
and the bolts 9 realize rotational joints while the bolts 9 and levers 10 realize translational joints. 
Through the moving towards the exterior of the weights 8, the levers 10 spins around the joints 
realized with the driving hub 1. Thus, the other ends of the levers 10 push, through the bolts 12, the 
pistons 13. In this "area" of the clutch, levers 10 together the bolts 12 and the pistons 13 realize 
complex joints like those realized by weights 8, bolts 9 and levers 10. The pistons 13 produce the 
mutual pressing of the friction disks pack consists of the pressing plate 14, the driving friction disks 
15, driven friction disks 16 and the lid 5. The pressing plate 14 and the driving friction disks 15 are 
grooved towards the exterior and driven in rotation movement by the on interior grooved ring 4. The 
driven friction disks 16 are grooved towards the interior and drive the conducted semi-coupling 2 
through its on exterior grooved surface.

The adjustment of the torque transmitted by the clutch is realized through the axial placement of 
disk 6. Thus, the complex joints, consists of weights 8 with bolts 9 and levers 10, can be placed, by 
the axial point of view, in different positions, modifying the amplification ratio of the mechanisms 
with lever. The adjustment is made through the rotation of the bush 18 that presents an outside 
threaded zone. The bush 18 is axial fixed relative to the conducting hub 1. The locking of the bush 
18 in a certain position is possible with a threaded bolt 21 and causes the adjustment of a certain 
torque.  
The relative centering of the two semi-couplings is realized with the ball bearings 22.  
For a constructive solution patented [5], the lever multiplying ratio (ka = l1/l2) from the driving 
mechanism had values from 1.2 to 2.  
Conclusions 
The clutch has the major advantage that the torque value transmitted doesn't depend only on the 
constructive dimensions and/or on the functional revolution speed. 
Thus, for the same functional revolution speed, different values of the torque transmitted can be 
obtained or, for different functional revolution speed the same torque value can be obtained. 
On the other hand, the disadvantage of this clutch is represented by the constructive complexity, 
set off in large measure by the adjustment possibility and its performances. 
In comparison with the existent solutions for the centrifugal clutches produced by the specialized 
firms, the present solution is comparable form the point of view of radial and axial overall 
dimensions but, it overcomes these solutions through both the transmission capacity (torque value) 
and the fact that it offers the possibility of adjustment.

Abstract. This study aims to validate the use of R744 for a resonant twin piston compressor for 
domestic applications. The vapor-compression refrigeration is the most commonly approached 
method for cooling household appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioning systems. The 
R134a refrigerant is one of the most suitable refrigerants from an energetic point of view. R744 
(CO2) compressors are less efficient, but the fact that the R134a raises serious environmental issues 
pushes commercial trend towards the usage of R744 [1]-[3]. Use of R744 in household appliances is 
currently an open topic and no company has switched yet to the environmental-friendly alternative. 
In this paper the fill efficiency will be simulated in order to validate if a conventional compressor 
such as the opposite twin piston compressor is capable of filling with refrigerant when operating at a 
50Hz frequency. Such a validation can enable further investigations regarding the replacement of 
R134a with R744. 
Introduction 
 
Haloalkanes such as the R134a refrigerant are successfully used in heat machines due to 
their high heat of vaporization. However their toxicity and greenhouse effect indicate that in the 
near future it will be rather difficult to comply with environmental legislation [4]-[6]. One solution 
to comply with legislation is adopting a different refrigerant. The R744 (CO2) is an accessible and 
non-toxic natural gas and its potential as refrigerant for air conditioning systems has already been 
proven in the automotive industry [7]. However air conditioning compressors for automotive 
applications have mechanical input power which operates at variable values. A compressor which is 
designed for domestic applications is powered by the electric grid which has a frequency of 50Hz. 
Therefore such compressors are actuated by either linear or rotational electric actuators. Considering 
the simplicity and price accessibility, the most common mean to power the compressors is by using 
electromagnetic linear actuators [8], [9]. Such designs are state of the art regarding actuating the 
piston compressors of household appliances. 
 
The piston compressors, however, have a major disadvantage regarding to compressors that 
use rotary actuators, e.g. the energy required to accelerate the piston at each cycle and the noise and 
vibrations that come along with the piston dynamics. The kinematic energy that is charged to the 
piston at each cycle can be regenerated. Considering piston inertia, gas forces and friction, the 
piston can be designed along with a spring as a resonant spring-mass system [10]. Such a 
mechanism can conserve most of the energy that is input in the piston dynamics. Nevertheless, a 
resonant system implies vibration of the components, and therefore vibrations of the entire 
compressor. Current equipment must display noise ratings and therefore vibrations can affect the 
rating of the device that is equipped with the piston compressor [11], [12]. The balancing of piston 
compressors is therefore an issue of interest regarding development of such equipment. A simple 
way of balancing such compressor is using opposite pistons which act synchronous [13]. Such 
devices equip refined heat machines that have to comply with high comfort demands.  
 
The possibility to operate a twin opposite piston compressor with R744 will be further 
analyzed in this paper. The intake process will be simulated using CFD analysis. The CAD model is 
based on a 3D scanned geometry of a check valve and compression chamber. The models are

In real conditions the piston displacement encounters tribological resistance, gas forces and 
other friction sources. Those factors can alter the law of motion that is specific to spring-mass 
systems. Linear actuators, however can be designed in such a way to have variable force vs. 
displacement. Such an actuator is theoretically considered to cancel the parasitic losses that could 
decelerate the piston. The piston displacement will be considered ideal for the CFD simulation. 
Flow Simulation of the Intake Process 
 
In order to obtain flow visualization through the compressor for the intake process, the 
geometry of the compressor was built for this case study. That means that the main parameters of 
the compressor were predimensioned and the geometry was simplified to observe only the intake 
process. A cross-sectional view of the compressor and the simplified geometry used in the flow 
simulation can be seen in Figure 1. 
 
The method used for analyzing the intake process considers the volumetric displacement 
obtained by the travel of the two pistons, which are opposing one to another. The simplified case 
study considers the one way intake valve in open position during the pistons travel. For this case 
study, appropriate boundary conditions were applied, that are briefly described in Figure 2. The 
driving flow condition represents the pistons velocity, which is applied directly on the bounding 
mesh, where the pistons are located. [16]

Conclusion 
The CFD study confirms the functionality of a resonant compressor using CO2 as a working 
fluid. The main geometrical parameters will further be refined correspondingly to this flow analysis, 
in order to assure a better filling of the space swept by the two pistons. 
The paper offers useful information for predimensioning the electro magnets used for system 
actuation. Furthermore, the main elastic element or elements can be modeled to satisfy the needs of 
the resonant compressor. 
The pressure and density graphs confirm a satisfactory filling of the cylinders of the pump. 
Further CFD studies, based on this one, will include, for example a dynamic response of the 
inlet valve and a complete pumping cycle.

Abstract. The subjects of this paper are the existing bearing mountings of a testing rig for chain or 
belt drives. Friction in transmission without bearings is calculated by subtracting the bearing 
friction from the global friction. This is why it is of maximal importance in the correct evaluation of 
experimental measurements on the rig to have accurate data on the friction on bearings. After the 
period of running in, friction on the bearings is measured at certain intervals in time, also depending 
on rotational speed, load and lubricating oil temperature. 
Introduction 
The object of the present paper and current research is testing of friction on the existing bearing 
mountings of a friction testing rig for chain drives. One aspect of the research on chain drive 
friction is the evaluation of bearing friction of a basic chain drive system with transmission ratio 
equal to 1, depending on load, speed, temperature and quality of lubrication. The final goal of the 
research is the evaluation of friction losses in chain drives.  
Very few experimental results on chain friction have been published. A technique for measuring 
sliding loss in the timing chain and the loss in the guides of an engine, using equipment developed 
on a full engine is presented in [1]. The results are separate timing chain system losses into 
components, for given constant speed and temperature.   
The current research is looking to evaluate chain friction depending on the tensioning force, 
speed and temperature of lubricant. The basic procedure of our research on chain friction is 
presented in [2]. It uses a chain rig with the functional diagram from Fig. 1. The driving chain 
sprocket is mounted on the input shaft, which is part of the lower bearing box. The driven chain 
sprocket is mounted on the output shaft, which is part of the upper bearing box. The upper bearing 
box is fixed on a sliding carriage which allows vertical adjustment of the driven sprocket, also 
creating the tensioning force by a screw-nut mechanism. Specific sensors and devices measure the 
input shaft speed and input torque (determined by the frictions in chain and bearing boxes), the 
chain tensioning force, the temperature and pressure of the oil for the bearing boxes lubrication and 
for the chain lubrication. Testing rig devices control the input shaft rotational speed, tensioning 
force and temperature of the lubrication oil. 
The measured input torque is a sum of all the frictional torques in the transmission: from the 
bearing mountings and from the chain drive. Friction in chain drive without bearings is calculated 
by subtracting the bearing mountings friction (sum of friction in the two bearing mountings) from 
the global friction. Correct evaluation of chain friction is based on correct evaluation of bearing 
friction. 
The friction on the bearing mountings is a sum of friction in bearings and sealing elements, with 
important influence of the lubricating circuit. As presented in the calculus model of bearing friction 
of the producer [3], the global friction depends on rotational speed, radial load (there is no axial 
load in this case), bearing and sealing types (construction, dimensions, clearances, lubrication and 
materials), temperature of oil. Analyze of theoretical influences of these parameters on bearing 
boxes friction is presented in [4]. The experimental evaluation of friction in the bearing mountings 
of the chain friction rig, with influence of the same parameters is presented in [5].

Bearing friction had to be measure from time to time, due to very long periods of testing. This 
paper presents the results of time depending bearing friction measurements, also depending on 
rotational speed, load and lubricating oil temperature. The literature [6] shows that we should 
expect a fast drop of friction in the running in period, continuing with a slower decrease, then 
stabilizing and finally increase of friction closing to the failure of the machine. The results 
presented here show that the time depending friction must consider also some other aspects. 
Equipment and Testing Conditions 
Bearing Mountings. The chain rig uses two bearing boxes. Fig. 2 presents the lower bearing box. 
The upper bearing box is similar as type of bearings and sealing. Both bearing boxes are consisted 
of: one deep grove ball bearing 6206 (1 – see Fig. 2), which takes radial force and possible axial 
forces on both directions; one single row cylindrical roller bearing with two shoulders NU 2305 (2), 
taking the most important radial force; sealing rings (3) at both ends; lubrication with low pressure 
oil circuit. Both bearing boxes are radial loaded with force F (tensioning force on chain drive). 
Radial loads on bearings depend on position of force F. 
 
 
Fig. 2. Lower bearing box 
 
Measurement Equipment. The measurement device is adapted on the chain rig presented in Fig. 1. 
Fig. 3 shows the functional diagram of the bearing friction measurement device. The upper and 
lower bearing mountings are coaxially mounted, head to head, connected through a mobile coupling 
[7]. The connection must assure that the torque is transmitted between the two shafts but also that 
the reduced load on shafts end is consisted of only radial force and no bending moment. 
Both bearing boxes are radial loaded with force F positioned as in the chain transmission 
tensioning situation. The load is applied through the tensioning system of the testing rig and a rigid 
element, mounted between the sliding carriage and the upper bearing box. The measurement of 
bearing friction is performed in the same conditions of running as in the case of chain testing.

Testing Conditions. The testing procedure and preparation of the rig are presented in detail in [2]. 
The oil used in bearing lubrication is Castrol Edge 5W30 and the measured viscosity depending on 
temperature is presented in Fig. 4. The oil is used for friction testing only in the first 250 hours of 
running. Bearing friction torque (Tb) is measured for steady steps of: rotational speed, n between 
500 and 5000 rot/min, tensioning force, F between 0.5 and 3 kN, oil temperature for bearings 
lubrication, t between 35 and 60 °C, 2 or 3 tests for each steady step. The bearing mountings 
followed a 50 hours running in procedure, friction measurements started after 200 hours of running 
and repeated at approximately 250 hours of running.

Experimental Results 
Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 presents the diagrams for bearing boxes friction torque depending on rotational 
speed and tensioning force, for three steps of lubricating oil temperature, after 200 hours, 
respectively 1150 hours of running. A brief comparison between the two sets of measurements 
shows that there is an almost general trend of decrease in friction.  A simple visual analysis shows 
that there is a trend of increasing the load influence on friction in time.  
Figures 7 to 9 show the time depending bearing friction torque for the three stages of lubricating 
oil temperature. Each diagram presents, for constant rotational speed, time depending friction for 
four stages of load. The diagrams consider measurements at 200, 450, 700, 950 and 1150 hours of 
running. 
All the diagrams present markers for the average of the results of measurements and a trendline 
based on polynomial function of second order.

By analyzing the diagrams from Figures 7 to 9, few remarks could be drawn: 
• There is not a general trend in time depending friction (increase, decrease, stabilize) of 
bearings running on several periods of steady conditions (load, speed, temperature); 
• Time depending friction is clearly depending on running conditions (load and speed); 
• The bigger drop in friction, almost 25 %, comes with the lowest oil temperature (35°C), 
lowest load (0.5 kN) and lowest rotational speed (500 rot/min). 
• For the lowest oil temperature (35°C) the general trend is decreasing friction in the first 
700 hours of running, with a trend of stabilizing in the following hours; an exception is 
the case of  high loads and high rotational speed where the decreasing trend continues; 
• For just little higher oil temperatures (50 and 60°C) – lower viscosity, there is a trend of 
decreasing friction followed by stabilizing or even slow increasing in case of small loads 
(0.5, 1 kN); in the case of higher loads (2, 3 kN) the trend is a continued slow increase in 
friction; 
• The cases with friction closed to constant are the one with medium loads (1, 2 kN), high 
rotational speed (1800 to 5000 rot/min) and high oil temperatures (50 and 60°C).

Summary 
A general trend of time depending friction is not possible to be defined for bearings running on 
several periods of quasi steady conditions (load, speed, temperature).  An average trend of friction 
decreasing in time can be deduced, but for specific conditions, friction may follow a different trend. 
This paper shows that for high loads and high speed steady conditions time depending friction may 
follow different trends.

Abstract. In this paper a pumping systems for deep extraction is simulated using SolidWorks and
ADAMS. The elastic displacement of a point on the flexible moving cable is analyzed. The dynamics
of the system is characterized with phase plane, Poincaré maps, and Lyapunov exponents. The Lya-
punov exponents represent the dynamic stability of the system. The largest Lyapunov exponents for
three different angular velocity show the chaotic motion of the system.
Introduction
Artificial pumping systems for deep extraction have a significant importance in oil industry. In [1] a
rod pumping system used lo lift oil to the surface was analyzed by describing longitudinal rod stretch
vibrations as a sum of fixed-free modes. The rod moves vertically, driven at the fixed end by a constant
speed motor through a four-bar mechanism. The partial differential equation describes the rod upstroke
and down stroke motion. The partial differential equation was reduced by modal analysis to a set of
ordinary differential equations. One-mode representation captures the rod string stretch and was used
to investigate the response at various crank speeds. The single-equation representation may be of value
to an engineering designer who desires to characterize the system.
A general method for the planar kinematic analysis of a pumping unit was presented in [2]. For
this model, a local coordinate frame is attached to each solid, with respect to a fixed frame. The
position of each point of a body is found by specifying the global translational coordinates of the
local coordinate frame origin and its angle of rotation relative to the global coordinate frame. Motion
constraint equations are developed using the vector approach of connected bodies. These equations
are solved to determine the position, velocity and acceleration of individual links. Both types of joints,
revolute and prismatic pairs are taken into account. The method can be used as a tool for design and
optimization of the pumping unit.
A pumping unit using a parallelogram mechanism was analyzed in [3]. Using the factor of max-
imum torque and maximum acceleration design variables of the parallelogram mechanism were an-
alyzed. A genetic algorithm was adopted in order to optimize the pumping mechanism. The results
showed that the performance of the pumping unit were improved due to the changing of the parts di-
mensions. In [4], based on the theory of linear transformation and vector operations, it was proposed
a method of a beam pumping unit explicit analysis. There were determined the kinematics and the
torque factor in the central bearing and the crank torque for three beam-types of pumping units. The
validity of the proposed method was illustrated by a numerical example.
A calculation method for a rod pumping system design was presented in [5]. The mathematical
model was determined based on kinematic and dynamic analysis of the pumping system. Empirical
formulas and correction factors are used for the simulation. Underground work conditions do not
permit the location of equipment using sensors. The dynamic analysis of the polished rod system
is achieved using dynamometer cards available at the surface [6]. For the polished rod systems are
proposed coupled ordinary differential equations and damped wave equations. Yang et al. presented
a mathematical model where a viscous-damped-wave equation model has been developed to describe
the rod-string behavior at various well depths [7]. The method was validated by a real case associated
with an existing well. In [8] an optimization criterion using a large number of combinations of pumping

rod parameters was presented. The optimization function is represented by the sum of non-dimensional
pumping rod parameters. An application of the identification techniques for a sucker-rod pump system
was presented in [9]. Experimental tests were conducted in a real plant to check the used controller
algorithm.
In our research we use ADAMS simulation to characterize the chaotic behavior of a center point
on the flexible wire. The Lyapunov exponents [10] will give the dynamic stability for different angular
velocities [10].
Fig. 1: SolidWorks and ADAMS model
Computer Simulation
The geometric modeling of the pumping unit was performed using SolidWorks software. The pumping
unit is basically a four-bar mechanical linkage. Its main elements, shown in Fig. 1, are: the crank-arm 1
rotates with the slow-speed shaft of the gear reducer, placed on a support; the pitman arm 2 connects
the crank-arm 1 to the walking beam 3. The walking beam ends in the horsehead which through the
hanger assembly moves the polished rod 5. Counterweights are attached to the crank arms allowing for
adjustment along the crank arm axis. The whole structure is built over a rigid steel base, usually set on
a concrete foundation. The operation of the above linkage ensures that the rotary motion input to the
system by the prime mover is converted into a vertical reciprocating movement output at the horsehead.
The sucker rods attached to the horsehead follow the movement and drive the bottomhole pump. This
system avoids the transmission of sudden effort or vibration from the walking beam to the gear reducer.
The horsehead is securely attached to the walking beam by the throat bolt and has a curvature to ensure
that the polished rod is moved in a vertical direction only. The mechanism dynamics was realized using
an ADAMS program, as shown in Fig. 2 and it involved the determination of the elastic analysis.
The flexible element is the element 4, as sown in Figs. 1-2, and the procedure of its transforming
from rigid solid in deformable solid is based on the finite element method. Therefore, for each rigid
or flexible kinematic element, the variation laws of generalized coordinates were determined. These
generalized coordinates expressed the position and orientation of a kinematic element relative to the
global reference frame or to the user-defined reference frame. The motion analysis of the flexible
element 4 involved the motion of the body as rigid solid. It was studied the variation of the position

vector components of the mobile reference frame attached to the flexible element and, respectively,

elastic dynamic motion was expressed in terms of the following reference frames: the global reference
frame, the mobile reference frame attached to the analyzed flexible element, any other reference frame
placed on a marker or node of interest of the flexible element. In order to analyze the dynamics of
the pumping mechanism there were required the following input data: the geometry of mechanism,
made of solid models in a parameterized frame; the material and the inertial characteristics defined
by modeling and analysis software; the time variation law of the force acting on the pumping rod,
experimentally determined. The response function of the driving torque acting in the motor joint was
identified through simulations using ADAMS programming environment.

was studied. The time variation diagrams for the components of the translational vector of the center
of mass of the kinematic element 4 were determined during the flexional motion generated by the
mechanism operation. Translational vector components were expressed in relation to the reference
system attached to the flexible element in un-deformed state. The diagrams of kinematic parameters
time variation of the flexible element were determined for three dynamic regimes built for different
values of the driving torque. When the pumping mechanism works during more cycles (11 cycles),
the driving torque Mm was defined by the following variation law:
Mm = M0 ∗(1 −WZ(MARKER_55, MARKER_56, MARKER_56)/ω0),
(1)
where M0 = 13 (107) N mm and ω0 = 0.80, 1.20, 1.50 rad/s. Figure 3(a) represents the magnitude, r,
of the translational vector of the center of mass of the kinematic element 4 in time for ω0 = 0.80 rad/s.
Figure 3(b) depicts the phase space of the variable r for ω0 = 0.78 rad/s. The phase space represents
the space of generalized coordinates and momenta of a dynamical system. In phase space the time-
evolution of a system can be described by first order differential equations. A point in phase space
uniquely determines the future of a system. Figure 3(c) represents the Poincaré map for the coordinate
r. The Poincaré map is a mapping of an intersection point of a trajectory with a surface of section onto
the subsequent intersection point. In this way continuous time evolution in phase space is reduced to
a map of a lower dimensional plane onto itself. In explicitly time-dependent systems, which are T-
periodic, the natural choice for a Poincaré map is the `stroboscopic map' mapping the variables at time
t onto those at t + T. The name refers to the mathematician and mathematical physicist H. Poincaré.
Here T represents the maximum of the function r(t).
Phase plane and first Poincaré maps will be used to characterize the system when it attained this
equilibrium. Phase plane for the point on the elastic wire shown no structure in Figure 3(b). Periodic

data represent a closed curve on phase plane. A limit cycle corresponds to a closed curve in phase
space and represents a periodic motion of the system. The system is not periodic.
A discrete map or a Poincaré map of the motion of the system is obtained by inserting a fictitious
traverse plane to the time evolution of the trajectories in the phase space and observing the successive
intersections of the trajectories with this plane. For a periodic system the trajectories on the Poincaré
map intersect the traverse planes at a fixed point every time. From Fig. 3(c) there are stretching and
folding of the trajectories, causing nearby points to separate and the plots do not appear as a point.
The motion is not peridic.
Next the Lyapunov exponents are calculated. Lyapunov exponents are numbers that measure the
exponential attraction or separation in time of two adjacent trajectories in phase space with different
initial conditions. A positive Lyapunov exponent indicates a chaotic motion in a dynamical system
with bounded trajectories. The Lyapunov exponents are named after the dynamicist Lyapunov (1857-
1918). Lyapunov exponents could provide a useful characterization of a given data set. They can be
used to determine the chaotic behavior. The signs of the Lyapunov exponents provide a qualitative
picture of a system's dynamics. Any system containing at least one positive Lyapunov exponent is

defined to be chaotic, with the magnitude of the exponent reflecting the time scale on which system
dynamics become unpredictable. For a periodic solution all exponents would be negative. Figure 4

Conclusions
In this paper the nonlinear dynamic analysis of a pump unit was developed. The focus of the study was
the translational vector of the center of mass of the flexible wire. Due to the complexity of the system
the simulations were performed with SolidWorks and ADAMS. The largest Lyapunov exponents for
three different angular velocity show the chaotic motion of the system.

Adapted Bouc-Wen Analytical Model for Romanian SERB-C Seismic 
Dampers Used in Buildings Protection System

Keywords: Seismic devices, friction devices, analytical model, hysteretic loop. 
Abstract. In this paper is presented a new mathematical model which is intended to simulate the 
hysteretic phenomenon of SERB-C Romanian friction device for damping and dissipation of 
earthquake energy used for buildings. These devices have unusual shape of force-displacement loop 
which can be simulated with our new model which represents a specific adaptation of the well 
known Bouc-Wen hysteretic model. The purpose of this analytical simulation is to determine a 
relation for the hysteretic loop which was obtained by experimental tests performed by the authors. 
The mathematical model presented in this paper can be used in computational simulation of a 
building protected with these types of devices, in order to determine the anti-seismic performances 
of a Romanian friction building protection system.  
Introduction 
These Romanian friction devices were invented in Romania by SIGMA STAR Service 
Bucharest. This company produces several types of building protection devices which are intended 
to be used in the isolation system or in the damping system. These devices are intended to be used 
at the supra-structure of the building in different configurations. 
They have hysteretic features based on the friction phenomenon between the components made 
from special steel. 
The study of this device is important because the costs of these devices are four times smaller 
then the classical dampers with viscous fluid which are very used for protecting the building during 
earthquakes. This aspect is useful because the damping system of a building is increasing the costs 
of building execution with 20 %. 
The experimental hysteretic loop of these friction devices (Fig. 1) was determined by 
experiments [1] and highlights the unusual shape of this graphic. This graphic shape is not possible 
to be simulated using the ordinary hysteretic models: Maxwell, Kevin-Voigt or Zener. 
Until now some Romanian researchers have used the classical Bouc-Wen (B-W) model [2] for 
this simulation. We have found that this model has some particularities which introduce several 
errors during simulation and we suggest in this paper a new adaptation of the B-W model.

where: A, β, γ, n are the shape parameters which influence the geometry and dimensions of 
graphical curve, z(ξ) is the force and ξ(t) is the displacement. For these devices experimental force-
displacement graphic we can use the following values A = 1, β = -5, γ = 2.5. 
In order to simulate the behavior of the damped buildings during seism using this hysteretic 
model we must take into account that the dampers will be elongated and compressed at different 
values of displacements. 
Considering for the displacements ξ(t) a sinusoidal form with exponential increasing amplitude, 
we can determine the shape of hysteretic loop during that excitation in dimensionless coordinates.

We have choose that specific form of displacements variation in order to observe the results 
offered by classical B-W model when the amplitude of the displacements is increasing from one 
cycle to another similar to the experimental test. 
By comparing Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 we can see that classical model has concentric curves which are 
not present in the experimental data (Fig. 1). In Fig. 1 the corresponding points for the forces at the 
end of the course are positioned on the exterior branches of the graphic curve and in Fig. 2 we can 
observe that these corresponding points are in the interior of the loop branches. 
That means that the force for a specific displacement is smaller than the experimental force for 
displacements smaller than the maximal amplitude and the theoretical force-displacement graphic is 
loosing his features in these cases. 
For that reason we have defined a modification of the classical model which is not loosing his 
features for displacements smaller than the maximal amplitude.

This relation is for both branches and is easy to apply in computational models. 
We have two cases: 
- 
case 1 – when the force and displacement have the same signs: C=ct1; 
- 
case 2 – when the force and displacement have different signs: C=ct2. 
Considering for the displacements ξ(t) a sinusoidal form with exponential increasing amplitude, 
it can be drawn the force-displacement graphic for that excitation in dimensionless coordinates.

Conclusions 
By comparing Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 we can observe that the hysteretic loop determined 
with the new modified model is more appropriate to simulate the experimental curves because the 
force at the end of the course is positioned on the exterior branches of the graphic the same way as 
in the experimental case. 
Because the new relation model is defined with a single expression for both branches, it can be 
very easily implemented in computational models. 
The new model has the same versatility as the classical model and both use the same parameters: 
A, β, γ. For the new model the exponent n is considered n=1. 
In order to simulate the behavior of Romanian new friction devices, this paper proposes a new 
mathematical model which has the advantages that is not loosing his features for displacements 
smaller than the maximum amplitude.

Abstract. This paper presents a simulation made with Ansys software on the stress and strain state 
of the node region of a reinforced concrete building subjected to earthquakes and equipped with 
devices for seism energy dissipation. This simulation includes the forces developed by the damping 
devices which act on these important nodes regions. The main goal of this simulation is to 
determine if the presence of the damping device at the supra-structure of the building is increasing 
the stresses and strains in the concrete and reinforcement bars of the node during earthquakes. For 
this study were used damping devices with damping forces depending on displacements. The results 
are very useful in the process of designing the damping system for the superstructure of the building 
and in the process of designing the reinforcements of the building nodes regions. 
Introduction 
It is a current practice to use in the process of buildings design the damping systems which are 
useful in dissipating the earthquake energy and reducing the displacements, velocities and 
accelerations of the buildings storeys during earthquakes [1]. 
The devices used for buildings damping systems develop damping forces which act in the 
buildings nodes regions in order to restrain the amplitude of displacements between two storeys in 
the case of earthquakes. These forces are depending on displacements or on velocities. 
In the case of viscous fluid dampers the damping forces are depending on velocities between two 
storeys, the maximum values of the forces is achieved when the displacement between storeys is 
zero.  
In the case of SERB Romanian dampers [2, 3] the damping forces are depending on 
displacements between two storeys and the maximum values of the force in this case appears when 
the displacements between two storeys is maximal. 
In this paper we intend to present the most dangerous loading case of the building frame node 
when the displacements between two storeys are maximal and the damping force is achieving the 
maximum values. This study is useful in order to determine the effect of the damping forces of 
damping devices on the building frame node stresses and strains values.  
 
Ansys Simulation 
For the 3D simulation we have considered a model of a building frame with three storeys, with 
storey height 3 m, the distance between columns 5,5 m, column section 90 x 90 cm and the beam 
section 60 x 30 cm. 
We have used this model in order to determine the inclination angle of the column base at the 
last storey for a specific displacement of 20 mm between the last to storeys. After finding these 
angles we have focused on a smaller 3D model which includes only one storey made from two 
columns and one beam in order to determine the stresses and strains of the frame node region. 
For both 3D models we have used two types of finite elements such as: Solid65 for simulating 
the concrete and Link8 for simulating the reinforcement bars [4]. 
Solid65 is a very special finite element used only for concrete simulation and he is capable to 
simulate the creep, crack and crush of the concrete during loading cases. For better simulation of the 
concrete we have defined a special material with multi-linear option of Ansys software.

Fig. 1 Stress-strain curve for concrete material in Ansys [5] 
 
For reinforcement bar material we have used BST500 steel and we defined it in Ansys with the 
bilinear model of material having the yielding stress of 500 MPa. 
For the first model with three storeys we have considered the following contour conditions: 
- 
the nodes at the base of the model are fixed by restraining all degrees of freedom; 
- 
the impose displacements at the upper part of the model such as the relative displacement 
between storey 3 and storey 2 is increasing from 0 mm to 20 mm in 2 seconds. 
For solving this model we have chose the dynamic analyses option with increasing the impose 
displacements from 0 mm to 20 mm in 2 seconds. 20 mm is the maximal relative displacement 
achieved for a reinforced concrete building equipped with appropriate device for seismic protection, 
designed using Romanian design codes. 
These standard codes suggests a T section for the beams of the frame in order to take into 
account the rigidity of the slab connected with the beams. These rules have been implemented in 
our model in order to diminish the number of finite elements and the complexity of model. 
 
 
Fig. 2 Reinforcement bars system (left), concrete (right) - stress distribution [MPa] – section view 
 
This model with concrete material and reinforcement bars system is very complex and the 
solution time for dynamic analysis was around 24 hours. 
The results that are useful for the next step of the study are the inclination angles of the columns 
from the last storey. 
The second 3D finite elements model has joints at the base of columns and the upper parts of the 
columns have imposed rotations determined in the previous analysis of three storey model.

Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 shows the result in the case when the damping devices are not present and the 
structure is bending to the maximum position during earthquake. 
The next step of the study is to repeat the previous analysis considering the damping force 
increasing from 0 kN to 800 kN in the same time as the rotations of columns achieve the maximum 
value. For this step, in order to apply the damping force on diagonal direction of the frame, it is 
necessary to simulate the fixing system of the damping device at the intersection of the beam with 
the column. This task was done by coupling the displacements of nodes in contact with this virtual 
fixing system.

As we can observe in the Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 we have obtained the same maximal Von 
Mises stress 33,3 MPa in the concrete material of the building. That is because according to Fig. 1 
the concrete can not support more than 33,3 MPa before crushing or cracking. In the regions where 
Von Mises stress is 33,3 MPa, in reality the concrete material is crushed or cracked. In order to see 
the difference involved by the damping force we must compare the Von Mises strains (Fig. 6).

Conclusions 
For this study we have made two models and performed three dynamic analyses in order to 
determine the influence of damping force on the stress and strain state of a building frame node. 
The 3D finite element models include the nonlinear behavior of the concrete material and the 
complexity of reinforcement bars with the interaction between the concrete and the metallic bars. 
After this study we can conclude: 
- at relative displacement of 20 mm the concrete material is cracking and crushing in the region near 
the intersection between beam and columns; 
- Von Mises stresses in the reinforcement bars is not exceeding 384 MPa which is lower than the 
yielding stress of 500 MPa, that means the bars are having elastic deformations; 
- in the case when the damping force of 800 kN is present at relative displacement of 20 mm, the 
Von Mises stress in the reinforcement bars are diminishing to 365 MPa which is lower than the 
value obtained when the damping force is not present; 
- the fixing system of damping device which is positioned at the intersection of beam and column, is 
increasing the rigidity of that zone and diminishing the reinforcement bars stress.

Abstract: The paper presents the functional analysis of a parallel robotic system used for 
transperineal prostate biopsy. A simulation system to study the robot functional analysis was 
developed using the integrated MATLAB software. Given the fact that the robotic system is used in 
a medical environment, it has to meet certain safety requirements indicated by the medical doctors. 
In order to fulfill these needs an appeal to complex simulation software has to be made to help 
choosing the best kinematic solution for the robotic system. The designed simulation software 
offers a correlation between the structure of the robot and the surrounding medical environment, 
pointing out its workspace and possible configurations that might harm the human patient during 
the biopsy. 
Introduction 
In the Western European countries and the United States, prostate cancer is the most diagnosed 
non-epithelial cancer of men, representing 25% cancers of the "de novo" diagnosed and 9% of 
deaths from cancer [1] . 
In the United States the number of prostate cancer cases was, in 2009, of 192,280 (incidence rate 
158 / 100,000), with a mortality of 27,360 cases. The lowest incidence in prostate cancer was 
observed in Asia (8.2 ‰ in India, 6 ‰ in Japan and 2 ‰ in China). Compared with the US, the 
incidence of prostate cancer is 120 times lower in China [1] . 
In 2004 the incidence of prostate cancer in Romania has come to a value of 21.01 ‰ which 
places our country among countries with an average incidence of prostate cancer, taking into 
account Central and Eastern European countries. In 2006, the incidence of prostate cancer reached a 
value of 22.82 ‰, and growth continued to be reported [2]. 
In 2008, the incidence of prostate cancer in Romania was 30.67 / 100,000, the largest increase being 
recorded in age group of 45-64 years [3]. 
A biopsy is a procedure in which a sample of body tissue is removed and then investigated under 
a microscope. A core needle biopsy is the main method used to diagnose prostate cancer. It is 
usually done by an urologist, a surgeon who treats cancers of the genital and urinary tract, which 
includes the prostate gland[4].  
The biopsy technique involves needle orienting through ultrasonography, but this method has an 
important rate of false negative. In this context the need of rising the accuracy of the prostate biopsy 
arisen. This need could be met by detection and precise targeting of the malign lumps on the 
prostate gland and precise orienting of the biopsy needle into the pathologic zone of the prostate For 
a better orientation of the biopsy needle we have to appeal to robotic assisted intervention [4] 
Lately, robotics in medical domain became a trend. Because of their accuracy and ability to work 
in a radiated environment, robots started to be implemented in various medical tasks as surgery, 
diagnosis and rehabilitation.

Robotic assisted prostate biopsy has a higher accuracy and a better detection rate compared to 
manual prostate biopsy. The biopsy needle can be easily and accurately guided and the 
deformations of the tissue are reduced to minimum because the motion is constant [5] . 
Different robots for needle placing were developed in the last years, some of them having a parallel 
architecture [6,7,8]. 
This paper is structured as follows: second section of the paper presents kinematic structure of a 
robotic structure design for transperineal biopsy of the prostate [9,10], the third part of the paper 
describes main interface and structure of an application design to analyze o family of robots for 
transperineal biopsy of the prostate, the fourth part describes the workspace and singularities feature 
of the program and the fifth part represents target acquiring simulation module of the application. 
 
Kinematic Structure of  BIO-PROS-1-an innovative parallel robot 
 
 
 
Fig.1 Kinematic structure of BIO-PROS-1 
 
In Fig.1, the kinematic structure of a new parallel robotic system used for transperineal biopsy of 
the prostate namely BIO-PROS-1 is presented [9,10]. The structure consists in two robotic modules. 
The first module (left) is designed to guide the ultrasound probe during medical intervention. This 
module needs five degrees of freedom to be able to fully scan the prostate during biopsy. Structure 
is guided by 5 active translation joints namely q1, q2, q3, q4 and q5. The module for driving the 
ultrasound probe consists of two parallel sub modules: one parallel module with M=3 degrees of 
freedom of family F=1 with constant orientation of the guided platform and three active joins, 
considered as a class 3 joint; the other module is also a parallel one with M=3 degrees of freedom of 
family F=1 and two active joints working in cylindrical coordinates, considered to be a class 3 joint. 
The second robotic system (right) is designed to guide the biopsy gun during tissue sampling. 
This module also has five degrees of freedom as the first module and is driven by five active 
translational joints q’1, q’2, q’3, q’4 and q’5. Biopsy gun guiding module consists of two parallel sub 
modules. One parallel module with M=3 DOF of family F=1 with constant orientation of the 
platform and three active joints and is considered a class 3 joint. The second sub module is a 
parallel module with M=3 DOF of family F=1 and two active joints, working in cylindrical 
coordinates, considered to be a class 3 joint. Along the five active translational joints, each robotic 
structure is composed of ten passive joints and their afferent links that create the parallel feature of 
the structure. 
By using these kinematic schemes kinematic model of the structure can be calculated and 
implemented in the background of the below described simulation system.

ROBOCORE-Graphical Simulation System 
The graphic interface of the developed simulation system of one of the parallel robots designed 
for transperineal biopsy of the prostate, namely BIO-PROS-1, is presented in Fig. 2. BIO-PROS 1 is 
part of a family of parallel robotic structures designed for prostate biopsy[10]. The simulation 
system has an open structure which allows easily the further implementation of the other parallel 
structures belonging to the same robot family. The interface is designed in MATLAB R2012a using 
the robot kinematic model [9]. In the left part of the panel are the tools used to simulate the TRUS 
probe module motion.  
 
 
 
 
Fig.2 Simulation System 
 
The left-upper panel of the interface consists of general coordinates of the TRUS probe module 
(represented in the left picture). By modifying the sliders of these coordinates, the ultrasound 
module moves according to the direct kinematic model (DKM), implemented in the simulation 
system, but in the same time the coordinates of the center point defining the TRUS probe 
(XE,YE,ZE,Ψ,θ) changing accordingly to modifying one of the generalized coordinates can be 
observed. These coordinates are given in the left-lower panel and this section has also the option to 
change the values of these coordinates, but this time the background mathematical model is given 
by the inverse kinematic model (IKM) and by modifying the coordinates at the tip of the ultrasound 
probe, the generalized coordinates Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q5 are changing according to the IKM.  
The DKM is calculated having as initial parameters the generalized coordinates of the ultrasound 
module Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q5, the output being the end-effector (TRUS probe) parameters, namely 
(XE,YE,ZE,Ψ,θ). In the case of the IKM, the input parameters are (XE,YE,ZE,Ψ,θ) and as output the 
values of the generalized coordinates Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q5. 
In the right part of the interface are the panels for simulating the biopsy gun motion (represented 
in the right picture). The strategy in implementing these panels is the same as for the 
implementation of the TRUS probe panels, the difference consisting in the fact that the generalized 
coordinates of the biopsy gun are given by Q’1, Q’2, Q’3, Q’4 and Q’5 and end-effector (biopsy gun) 
position and orientation is given by (X’E,Y’E,Z’E,Ψ’,θ’). 
In the graphic interface, both robotic structures are represented in the same coordinate system.  
In the middle-lower part of the graphic interface is implemented a panel named Static 
Geometrical Parameters. These parameters are the overall dimensions of the parallel robot and these 
can be modified, too. By modifying these parameters, the whole mathematical model needs to be 
recalculated because all parts of the robotic assembly are dimensioned according to working 
environment. This feature of the simulation system allows to optimize the structure by calculating 
each active joints stroke and eliminate unnecessary elements or lengths in the structure. 
Application has also implemented the feature of modifying (rotating) viewpoint of the structure 
in the horizontal and vertical planes, this feature being very helpful in understanding the kinematics 
of the structure and identifying its unnatural positions.

Workspace representation feature 
The study of the robot workspace is essential in medical applications. In order to define this 
workspace several restrictions have to be imposed: 
 The maximum and minimum lengths for each of the generalized coordinates of the robot(Q1, 
Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5 ) for the TRUS module and (Q’1, Q’2, Q’3, Q’4, Q’5 ) for the biopsy gun 
module. 
 Length of the probe inserted inside the patient is less or equal with probe length. 
 Orientation angles should not exceed certain values (Ψ ϵ [60◦, 120◦], θ ϵ [45◦, 135◦],). 
 The robotic system should avoid singularity points by imposing: abs(det(A)≠0) and 
abs(det(B)≠0) 
 
 
 
Fig.3 Workspace and Singularities Representation 
 
Fig. 3, presents the workspace of the TRUS probe (blue) and the workspace of the biopsy gun 
(red). The workspace is generated using mathematical background functions developed in 
MATLAB and with respect to the above restrictions. By defining the robot workspace and the 
patient position, a higher degree of safety for the patient can be achieved, because both of them 
(robot and patient) can be manipulated by means of virtual simulation in order to achieve an optimal 
position.  
The right part of the Fig.3 represents the singularities of the analyzed robotic structure. In the 
case of parallel robots are defined 3 types of singularities: 
 type 1 singularities occur when the determinant of the Jacobi matrix in the case of IKP is 
zero (represented with green color in Fig.3),  
 type 2 singularities occur when the determinant of the Jacobi matrix in the case of DKM is 
zero (represented with black color in Fig.3),  
 type 3 singularities occur when both determinant are zero and are called architectural 
singularities (represented with red color in Fig.3). 
 
  
Positioning and motion simulation 
 
Another problem that can be solved by using this application and its future implementation into 
the control system of the robot is the relative position between the robot and the patient before and 
during the medical procedure. To achieve this relation, an additional sensor system needs to be 
implemented. This system consists in three pairs of positioning sensors mounted on the biopsy table 
where the robot is placed and on the human patient. Sensors placed on the biopsy table keep the 
same position and orientation with the reference system of the robotic system, meanwhile the 
sensors mounted on the human patient (preferably in areas that don’t change position during patient 
scanning – the thoracic region) are changing their position and orientation during medical 
104

investigations. To eliminate the positioning errors, before performing a CT/MRI investigation, the 
positioning sensors are mounted on the human patient, and the patient is seated on the biopsy table 
to initialize the robotic system. After the data has been collected, the sensors have to remain 
attached on the patient body, but the patient is free to move in accordance to perform medical 
investigation. After the targeted area of the cancer is obtained, the patient is seated again on the 
biopsy table, but this time the targeted zones for biopsy with respect to initial data obtained before 
performing CT/MRI investigation are provided. 
In Fig.4 is given a schematic representation of the above mentioned setting. Main reference 
system is given by robotic system namely OXYZ. OtXtYtZt is the reference system of the biopsy 
table with respect to OXYZ system given by Rt. OpXpYpZp is the reference system given by real 
time reading values of the sensor mounted on the human patient with respect to biopsy table 
reference system OtXtYtZt and robot’s reference system OXYZ. The difference between biopsy 
table position and patient position are given through Rtp vector which controls displacement of the 
patient along OX, OY, and OZ axis and the Ψp, θp angles which describe the rotation of the patient 
with respect to the robotic system and the biopsy table. 
 
 
Fig.4 Patient position simulation 
 
The application is able to simulate motion into a given point defined by inserting point 
coordinates as end-effector parameters (as seen in the upper part of the Fig.4). In the patient panel 
are given the insertion point coordinates for the needle, and in the robot panel the current position of 
the robot is shown. The motion to the given point by providing the motion step can be simulated. In 
the right part of the figure the graphical simulation of the motion can be observed.   
The application was build to be able to simulate the whole family of robotic systems designed 
for transperineal biopsy of the prostate, by choosing the desired robotic system from a drop-down 
list.

Conclusions 
A simulation system developed to study the functionality and behavior of a robotic system used 
for transperineal biopsy of the prostate has been presented. The application has the advantage 
assisting in the selection of the optimal parameters of the robotic structure, in obtaining its 
kinematics, the workspace and singularities of the systems used in this medical procedure, 
providing the optimal position of the patient during medical intervention with respect to safety 
requirements given by the medical personnel, and simulate the motion of the robot with respect to a 
given insertion point.

Abstract. Based on upper limb’s biomechanisms, in this paper, a robotic rehabilitation system is 
presented. It is designed as a 4 DOFs wearable exoskeleton applicable for repetitive practice of 
passive or active movements of the arm in shoulder joint and forearm in elbow joint. The kinematic 
analysis of the proposed system is followed by the 3D model and a description of the developed 
prototype. 
Introduction  
The overall goal of rehabilitation is represented by integration into society and family of disabled 
people, as well as continuous improvement of the quality of their life. There are two ways to 
achieve this goal: replacing the totally lost functions and assisting partially diminished functions. 
Statistical data are showing great number of those who suffer a stroke and high percentage of stroke 
survivors who are chronically impaired or permanently disabled, requiring post-stroke rehabilitation 
procedures [1], [2].  
 The upper limb represents one of the most important segments of the locomotion apparatus. Its 
motor functions (the positioning and orientation of the hand and the possibility to grasp objects in 
different ways) are supplemented by its very important sensorial function, determined by the 
structure and properties of the skin tissue, [3]. Hemiparesis on the upper limb leads to sever 
limitations in carrying out a wide spectrum of essential activities. The main characteristics specific 
to hemiparetic patients are: weakness of specific muscles, abnormal muscle tone, lack of mobility, 
abnormal movement synergies, loss of interjoint coordination and loss of sensation, [4]. To 
eliminate the disadvantages of traditional rehabilitation (which involves short training sessions 
under the direct coordination of a therapist, with limited duration, manually assisted movement 
training), in nowadays there are currently proposed robotic - assisted recovery procedures, with 
increased efficiency and objective measurement of patient progress, [5] – [8]. 
This paper presents a robotic rehabilitation system, designed as a patient-oriented wearable 
exoskeleton, with 4 DOF, which can be used not only in dedicated rehabilitation clinics, but rather 
at home. According to [2], repetitive practice of movements can have a profound effect on recovery 
from stroke-related disability, thus the main functions of the proposed system are passive 
mobilizations of the upper limb at the shoulder and elbow joints for carrying out daily living 
activities, repetitive passive exercises and active with resistance mobilizations of the arm and 
forearm, for repetitive active with resistance exercises 
 
The biomechanisms of the upper limb  
 
The anatomic movements which allow positioning of the hand are flexion-extension, inner-outer 
rotation and abduction-adduction of the arm (in shoulder joint) as well as the forearm’s flexion-
extension (in elbow joint). The hand orientation is given by pronation – supination of the forearm 
and hand’s abduction-adduction and flexion – extension (in the wrist), [2], [9]. Based on upper limb

biomechanisms, depending on the number of considered anatomical movements, the structures of 
different exoskeletons may be systematized, as in [9]. 
If we consider only four movements of above presented seven movements, different 4 DOFs 
biomechanisms of upper limb can be obtained (Fig. 1). For the basic anatomical movements, the 
following annotations were used in Table 1: θ1 – the internal-external rotation of the arm, θ2 – the 
abduction-adduction movement of the arm, θ3 – the flexion-extension movement of the arm, θ4 – 
the flexion extension movement of the forearm in the elbow joint, θ5 – the pronation-suppination 
movement of the forearm, θ6 – the flexion-extension movement of the hand, θ7 – the abduction 
adduction movement of the hand in the wrist joint. 
 
 
 
Fig. 1. The 4 DOFs upper limb biomechanisms 
 
In correspondence with the biomechanisms given in Fig. 1, several 4 DOFs exoskeletons, whose 
structure coincides with the structure of the biomechanisms, can be studied and developed. If we 
take into account the relative frequency of the independent anatomical movements, between 
variants in Table 1, shows interest the first one which addresses to shoulder and elbow joints. 
 
The kinematic analysis of 4 DOFs exoskeleton 
 
In our previous works, a 7 DOFs kinematic model of upper limb was developed, [3] for which 
have been obtained the equations for both forward and inverse kinematics. Also, few models for 
wearable exoskeleton robotic exercisers with 3 DOF were proposed in [10].

Figure 2 shows an exoskeleton mechanism that allows four movements, three at the shoulder 
level and one at the elbow level. The Denavit-Hartenberg method was used for the kinematic 
analysis. The Denavit-Hartenberg parameters of the exoskeletal mechanism given in Fig. 2 are

Relations (7-9) have two solutions. The right solutions must be analyzed in terms of mechanical 
constrains. The inverse kinematic model is important for programming command and control of the 
upper limb exoskeleton. 
 
The 3D model of the upper limb exoskeleton  
 
The novelty of the proposed system consists of its ability to be used for passive mobilizations of 
the arm and forearm, for carrying out daily living activities, as well as for repetitive passive 
exercises and repetitive active with resistance exercises. Another feature that differentiates it from 
existing systems is its modular structure which allows configuration of many different variants, 
depending on the requirements of each user. 
Our previous approach [9] enabled us to develop models of diverse members of a family of 
modular wearable exoskeletons for upper limb, with different complexity and structural 
configuration. In Fig. 3, the model of a 4DOFs exoskeleton, for arm and forearm mobilizations is 
presented. The 3D model is based on a Matlab model of upper limb – exoskeleton assembly, which 
provides relevant information for kinematics and dynamics of the exoskeleton system, in order to 
design it and choose adequate actuators. For specific combination of anatomical movements, 
angular velocity, angular acceleration and torque are computed while the amplitude of movement is 
imposed. The biggest values of the required actuator torque are those for passive movements of the 
arm in forward/backward projection and adduction/abduction. These values are determined by the 
weights of the limb segments and weight of the exoskeleton (the considered weights if its modules 
are: 2 kg for upper arm; 2 kg for forearm and 0.46 kg for the hand).The chosen actuators are 12 V 
DC motors with gear boxes (characterized by a torque of 24 Nm) and the initial braking modules 
for active exercises were rotational brakes as clutches with electrorheological fluid (ERF), [11]. 
In addition, in this paper the possibility to integrate linear brakes based on smart fluids in the 
structure of a 4DOFs exoskeleton, are investigated. The linear dampers can be implemented within 
the rehabilitation exercisers for developing resistive torques in different joints, in combination with 
simple and lightweight mechanisms. For example, we propose the slider-crank mechanism in order 
to fit a commercially available linear damper based on ERF to a certain joint of the exoskeleton, 
with consideration of the anthropomorphic dimensions of the users and their biomechanical 
characteristics.

Fig. 4a gives the kinematic scheme for the proposed structure. The crank 1 is moving together 
with the forearm 5, through the coupler 2 the movement is transmitted to the slider that is connected 
to the linear damper 3, fixed on the arm 4. The first problem we solved was the dimensional 
synthesis of the mechanism based on the associated positions (which correspond to the forearm in 
two positions for flexion and extension). Fig. 4b shows the implementation of this solution in the 
structure of a 4 DOFs exoskeletons. 
 
The experimental prototype shown in Fig. 5 is currently in development and completion phase. 
The length a3, correspondent to the arm might be set in the 20…28 mm interval, respectively the 
length a4, correspondent to the forearm, is adjustable in the 26…32 mm interval. This experimental 
prototype employs the following rotational angle opening: θ1 = -95…+80º, θ2 = 72º, θ3 = -20…+95º 
and θ4 = 150º. For active rehabilitation procedures, in order to generate the necessary resistive 
torque, an ERF damper, RheDamp RD16/100 made by Fludicon, was used.

Summary 
 
 
Robotic systems offer clear advantages in the rehabilitation so that today a dynamic field of 
robotics is in rapid and consistent development. Based on the anatomical structure of the upper limb 
and its biomechanics, the structural schemes of various degrees of mobility exoskeletons, which 
address various joints, were developed. The CAD models are characterized by a modular structure 
which allows further development, minimal changes for adaptation to each user, depending on the 
users' lack of motor functions.

The main functions of the studied robotic system are passive mobilizations of the upper limb at 
the shoulder and elbow joints for carrying out daily living activities, also repetitive passive 
exercises and active with resistance mobilizations of the arm and forearm, for repetitive active with 
resistance exercises. For these exercises involving active movement with resistance, the authors 
proposed a system that fits a commercially linear damper based on ERF to a 4 DOF exoskeleton. 
For a more efficient rehabilitation process, the developed exoskeletons will be used together with 
appropriate functional electrical stimulation systems.

Abstract: In this paper the knee joint biomechanics during squat exercises is studied. Using an 
acquisition system based on electro-goniometers, measurements of flexion-extension knee angle 
during squat movement on a sample group of healthy subjects are performed. For each subject the 
curves of knee squat angle are normalized and the mean squat cycle of each subject and the final 
medium cycle are determined. The phase plane portraits are used to characterize the kinematics of 
the biomechanical system. Using ADAMS software, the forces components and the resultant 
connection force during squat cycle in the human knee joint are determined. 
Introduction 
     The squatting movement is one of the most frequently used exercises in the field of strength and 
conditioning, but, also, it has close specificity to many everyday tasks (picking up children, lifting 
packages). The strength and stability of the knee plays an important role in athletics and activities of 
daily living [1]. A better understanding of knee joint biomechanics while performing variations of 
the squat is useful in rehabilitation and exercise prescription [1]. Kneeling and squatting are 
common activities that increase the risk of knee disorders, including arthritis and menisci injuries 
[2,3]. Squatting is considered one of the most functional and efficient weight-bearing exercises 
whether an individual’s goals are sport specific or are for an increased quality of life [4,5]. Because 
a strong and stable knee is extremely important to an athlete’s or patient’s success, an understanding 
of knee biomechanics while performing the squat is helpful to therapists, trainers, and athletes alike 
[4]. In [5] the authors examine kinematics and kinetics of the dynamic squat with respect to the 
ankle, knee, hip and spinal joints and provide recommendations based on these biomechanical 
factors for optimizing exercise performance.  
Material and method 
    Measurements of knee angle during squat movement were performed on a group of eighth 
subjects. In Table 1, the mean values and standard deviations of anthropometric data of subjects are 
presented. The subjects become familiar with the test which consists of 22 consecutive squat cycles 
by repeating them several times before the beginning of the final experimental test.

Equipment. The experimental data collected during squat test are acquired with a system based on 
electro-goniometers. An electro-goniometer is composed of two rods and a Vishay Sfernice P11L 
type sensor [6,7]. The data acquisition and control Arduino Mega 2560 board aims to collect 
information, to store it and process this data. 
Results  
    The angular amplitudes of human knee flexion-extension during the squat movement were 
obtained for each person from the report generated by the acquisition system. For the left knee of 
Subject No. 1 the diagram of 7 consecutive cycles of squat angles [degrees] in rapport with the 
number of acquired points is shown in Figure 1. For a good accuracy, for each subject were selected 
7 consecutive squat cycles, which were normalized by interpolation with cubic Spline functions, 
using MATLAB environment, and reported on the abscissa at a scaled interval from 0 to 100%. The 
medium cycle is determined as average that corresponds to the 7 cycles.

For each subject were drawn the normalized curves of flexion-extension angles corresponding to 
each squat cycle and the corresponding curve of the medium cycle. In Figure 2, there are displayed 
this normalized curves for the left knee of Subject 3. The range of maximum values and of average 
values for each subject is presented in Table 2.

Phase plane portraits 
Phase plane portraits are used to characterize the kinematics of the system [8-10]. Profiles of phase 
plane portraits are presented to demonstrate the utility of the approach in extracting information 
about the kinematics of steady state. Using phase plane portraits one can correlate the joint rotations 
with the respective joint velocities. Eliminating time from the graphical representation of the state 
variables of periodic systems provides a better understanding of the steady state dynamics. The 
phase plane plot is a two-dimensional plot in which the time derivative  d is plotted versus  at 
each data point. The phase plane plots, shown in Fig. 4 and contain information as the graph of data 
for Subject 1 and Subject 6. We can observe that for Subject 1 the angular velocity has the 
maximum value of 95-100 0/s when the angular amplitude is comprised in the inteval [200-250]  on 
the ascendant curve. The 0 value of speed is obtained for the flexion angle equal to 0 deg and, 
respectively, when the amplitude is maximum:1150-1180. Positive speed values are obtained for 
flexion phase (the ascendent curve) and negative values, for extension phase (the descendent curve). 
The phase plane portraits are almost concentric and  simetrical curves. Similar observations are 
made for the graphs of all subjects. Phase plane portraits can be utilized to compare the knee joint 
kinematics of healthy subjects and of patients with knee diseases, and to diferentiate the variations 
among the groups.

Virtual squat simulation.Using the values of the average anthropometric data taken from Table 1, 
we have developed the virtual model of a mannequin using SolidWorks software [6]. This model 
was transferred to ADAMS simulation environment [11,12]. The values of final medium cycle were 
taken from experimental results and the corresponding polynomial was determined by interpolation 
in Maple, having the expression:  
 angle [knee]=2.790+47.290*t+214.511*t2-250.631*t3+116.642*t4-27.065*t5+ 2.526*t6          (1) 
The simulation aim is to obtain the variation laws of the reaction forces in the human knee 
joint developed in the squat movement. The motion law of the left knee joint is introduced in 
ADAMS, as a six degree polynomial function, given by relation 1 (Fig. 5).

Conclusions 
In this paper the variations of knee flexion-extension angles during squat exercises for a sample 
of eight healthy subjects were analyzed. The squat movement presents interest because is 
considered one of the most functional and efficient weight-bearing exercises whether an 
individual’s goals are sport specific or are for an increased quality of life. When comparing the 
maximum values of the eight knees, we observe these ranged from 110.1670 to 138.5230 and the 
maximum amplitude of the medium cycle was 125.0370 (Table 3).   The results show that all the 
subjects performed the test with a good repeatability. There were not big differences in the shape of 
the flexion angle. Using ADAMS software, the forces components and the resultant connection 
force during squat cycle in the human knee joint are determined Determination of reaction forces in 
knee joint by numerical simulation in ADAMS is useful for future study of joint bones stress using 
dedicated software based on Finite Element Method. The results obtained can be used as a reference 
for the normal knee joint movement for further studies of abnormal movement. The effect of 
weight, of age and of different varus knee angles (that means different stages of osteoarthritis 
severity) on squat biomechanics for osteoarthritic and for prosthetic knee will be studied in the 
future work.

Abstract. In this paper an experimental research was performed in case of a human complex 
motion. The research aim was to evaluate the joint trajectories and angular variations of the main 
human locomotion system. Thus an experimental motion analysis was performed, by using two 
modern equipments in parallel, one called VICON Equipment and the other called CONTEMPLAS. 
The experimental activity was developed on a human subject when perform a complex motion for 
hitting a ball. The obtained results will be useful for the improvement of the athletes’ complex 
motions on sports such as football in the way of conserving the energy or to reshape the foot 
behavior when strikes the ball. 
Introduction 
Nowadays many high speed motion analysis equipments were developed and can be used to 
evaluate different types of mobile systems during motion. The variety of these equipments 
represents the result of the interdisciplinary cooperation between fundamental domains such as: 
mechanics, biomechanics, medical sciences and electronics. 
 
As regarding the sport activities it is well known that an athlete performance can be improved 
during excessive practice assessed by a coach. Also complex motions are evaluated in special 
biomechanics laboratories from worldwide [2, 3, 6, 7, 10].  
These complex motions are performed at high speed during time from different sport activities 
such as football, tennis, handball and others.  
In the past these complex motions were evaluated by using equipments to evaluate the maximum 
and minimum angular amplitudes of the human body segments similar to goniometers.  But these 
days the complex motions evaluation can be performed with high-end equipments based on sensors 
applied on the athlete body or by using motion analysis equipments such as VICON, SIMIMotion, 
CONTEMPLAS [1, 8]. These specialized laboratories perform similar analysis in five steps: a 
complete musculoskeletal evaluation and assessment, where the athlete will be give an 
individualized physical therapy treatment plan targeting specific muscle weaknesses and/or 
flexibility concerns; biomechanical motion capture using high speed video analysis software; 
comprehensive analysis of the athlete’s mechanics using the computer interactive software (this will 
be performed 2-4 weeks after this experimental analysis); one to one review of findings with the 
athlete and coach (on this phase the athlete will be informed with detailed explanation of the outputs 
by using live video review, written instruction, and photographic evidence. Also the instructor will 
explain any biomechanical concerns and review corrective measures); opportunity to correct 
mechanics by the athlete or preferably with the coach. Based on these steps the athlete’s 
performance will be improved [3].   
Another aspect is the one that these methods and equipments can be used on the athletes 
temporal recovery after injuries, by creating a database with motions performed by athletes when 
they are at a full capacity of their performance (also in a good health conditions) and have these 
information as reference ones for physical recovery after injuries in sports [5].  
Based on the above arguments and by having two equipments for experimental human motion 
analysis, a football exercise will be analyzed by performing the phase of hitting a ball.  This is 
shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. The desired motion used for the experimental analysis [4]. 
 
The existent motion analysis equipments are VICON and CONTEMPLAS, both are in the 
property of the University of Craiova. The performed experimental analysis was done at INCESA 
Institute from Craiova. With these equipments the human leg joints angular variations and 
trajectories will be evaluated and a comparison analysis between the obtained results will be 
performed. 
 Experimental Setup 
For the experimental analysis the mentioned equipments were described in a few schematized 
figures for each one in Fig 2 and 3. As regarding the experiment this was conducted by a physician 
and two scientists in mechanical engineering. The chosen human subject has the antrophometric 
data known and these will serve as input data for calibration of both equipments. The human subject 
was a male, age 28, 62 kilograms, 1,65meters height and his dimensional leg parameters known.  
The CONTEMPLAS setup was done in the same space where VICON Equipment was used too. 
The CONTEMPLAS Equipment has two cameras placed at an angle of 120 degrees which depends 
on the human subject motion development [1, 8].

As regarding the human athlete this was dressed in a special suit of black color and on a specific 
antrophometric points, reflexive markers were attached. An aspect of this is shown in Fig. 4.  
Thus the results target is represented by the trajectories and angular variations for the leg which 
performs the hit of the ball. The analyzed joints were: hip, knee and ankle. Also other markers were 
placed all over the athlete body on specific zones and in addition another two markers were 
considered for this analysis which was placed on the heel and toe of the right foot.

Experimental Analysis  
According to the equipment setup, on the athlete were analyzed 5 markers with reflective 
properties. Those markers represents the joint centers of the athlete’s leg and one of them represents 
an attached marker on the foot which indicate the foot contact with the ground during the proposed 
exercise. The collected data were acquired for a single hit and these consist in joint centre 
trajectories expressed in meters and angular amplitudes expressed in percentage of a full hit. 
Namely a single hit was recorded for the athlete between 0 to 1.51 seconds.  Sequences of the 
CONTEMPLAS software during analysis are shown in Fig 5.  The acquired data were processed in 
real-time. Also on VICON Nexus software a virtual exoskeleton was elaborated in accordance with 
the athlete antrophometric parameters. As an example of the acquired trajectories with VICON 
equipment on Fig. 6. are shown capture sequences during the ankle trajectories analysis.

At a first look the angular amplitudes obtained with both equipments are similar. If it will have a 
closer look to the diagram from Fig.7 the hip angular amplitude has an appropriate maximum value 
of 34.745 degrees in case of CONTEMPLAS Equipment and in case of VICON this is almost 
appropriate of 34.589 degrees. In the same diagram the lowest value was obtained in case of 
CONTEMPLAS Equipment which this was a negative one of -8.334 degrees. In case of VICON 
this was equal with -6.7823degrees. The obtained results looks almost appropriate as numerical 
values and this confirms that the calibration procedure was performed properly for both equipments. 
If it will discuss about the knee angular amplitude from diagram of Fig 8, it can be observed that the 
values are different and in case of CONTEMPLAS Equipment there are some noisy areas on the 
curve. Also in case of ankle angular amplitude from Fig. 9. The main cause of this could be the 
recorded speed of both equipments depending on the acquired resolution. Even so, the equipments 
setup was the same as the velocity of data acquisition which means this was at a value of 100 
frames/second and a frame rate of 1000 Hertz. In case of knee angular amplitude, the highest value 
was recorded in case of CONTEMPLAS Equipment and this was 38.654 degrees. The lowest value 
was recorded by CONTEMPLAS, which this was at 17.54 degrees. In case of the ankle joint 
angular amplitude the highest values with a noisy curvature were recorded again with 
CONTEMPLAS and it was equal with 38.678 degrees.  Also the obtained results correspond with 
the existent values on database from specialized literature in biomechanics domain [2, 9].

On the diagrams from Figs 10 to 11, there were presented the trajectories on X-Y plane. Thus X 
axis represents the horizontal axis and Y-axis represents the horizontal axis. In this plane the motion 
was performed by the athlete. By analyzing the diagrams from Figs 10 to 11, the arguments are 
almost similar with the ones from angular amplitudes. On these diagrams it can be remarked that 
the curves are smooth for both equipments. There are some small exceptions which are in the case

of Fig. 10, where hip trajectory obtained with CONTEMPLAS equipment has some noisy zone 
when the athlete leg reach the maximum position after strikes the ball. On a closer look there are 
some differences on the recorded values for both equipments. As a difference value it can be 
remarked that this it’s around 0.2 meters on all recorded trajectories. 
Conclusions  
This paper describes a procedure for evaluating the behavior of an athlete during a ball strike 
with his foot. Through this experimental analysis, remarks were obtained regarding the behavior of 
two equipments used for motion analysis only. In particular, two high-speed motion analysis 
equipments have been used for measuring motion ranges of significant points from the athlete’s leg. 
With these it can be established the accuracy of both equipments, and the use of these. The 
experimental results show that the obtained curves are similar with small differences on their 
numerical values. Moreover, one equipment offers modest results and also is a mobile one. It’s 
about CONTEMPLAS and it means that can be placed on any room with no special conditions. The 
other one called VICON it records on an infrared environment and the acquisition hardware is 
heavy to carry out of a special room. The infrared environment needs special attention to the 
reflexive objects existent during analysis. An important remark was obtained by comparing the 
obtained results which is represented by the CONTEMPLAS Equipment inefficiency on impact 
motion analysis, due to the low frame rate of the acquired values. Thus, the CONTEMPLAS 
Equipment cannot be used on impact motions due to its errors regarding trajectories and angles 
evaluations. 
Using these two equipments is possible to pattern of leg during the fast movement and to design 
the training program based on increase the explosive muscle force. 
By this way the coach and the staff team has a good approach about the behavior of leg, in each 
phase of movement, about the coordination (analyze the trajectories) and about the moment in 
which the co-contraction of muscle could reduce the amplitude of the movement.

Abstract. In this paper an experimental research was performed in case of a human rehabilitation 
exoskeleton. The research aim was to evaluate the joint trajectories and the influence of the ground-
foot contact by using two distinctive shapes of the exoskeleton foot. Thus an experimental motion 
analysis was used, called CONTEMPLAS and an exoskeleton prototype with 1DOF placed on a 
treadmill. The experimental activity was developed when the exoskeleton was used on walking 
activity. There were studied two types of foot shapes and also the generated impact of their form on 
the hip, knee and ankle joints trajectories during walking. The obtained results will be useful for the 
improvement of the exoskeleton orientation in space. 
Introduction 
Nowadays many rehabilitation systems were developed in order to make an easier life for 
persons with disabilities. The variety of these rehabilitation systems represents the result of the 
interdisciplinary cooperation between fundamental domains such as: robotics, mechanics, medical 
sciences and electronics. 
As regarding the mobility of disabled persons, it can be mention that a lot of systems were 
designed in order to maintain the human body on biped position. These systems were robotic ones, 
but also mechanical, which can have the same design conditions such as: lightweight, user-friendly 
interface, low-cost criteria. Some of them are quite expensive as reported in [2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 
15, 20]. These are intelligent ones and their functionality is based on dynamic control aspects or gait 
synthesis through sensors, actuators and other electronic devices controlled mostly by a computer 
processor. Also these are not accessible for any disabled person.  
Other solutions such low-cost ones does not accomplish the human needs for walking activity as 
natural motion which involves all human lower limb joints, like for example in the systems [1, 10, 
13, 19].  These are used only for emphasizing the human lower limbs motion at the joints level.  
There is also another category of human walking rehabilitation systems, but these are used on 
temporal recovery or walking assistance and also these require the assessment of a kinetotherapy 
specialist [9, 10]. Also these are complex ones and can partially recover the human locomotion 
motions. 
Through our research an exoskeleton with 1DOF was studied. This was designed in previous 
research works as in [3], and it consists in 6 actuated joints by one actuator at the level of knees and 
hips. The main problem of this research regards the ground-foot contact which plays a crucial role 
on space orientation of the entire structure (exoskeleton and disabled person). Although previous 
works of the authors were accomplished onto human walking analysis. From these some data which  
regards the human walking of a healthy human subject will be considered as reference for results 
validation, reported in [5, 6, 16, 17, 18, 21]. The analyzed exoskeleton is described in the second 
section together with the experimental setup.  For this it is proposed an experimental analysis of the 
exoskeleton in order to determine the joint trajectories and some characteristic points placed on the 
foot equivalent link. The experimental analysis is described through the third section.  Based on the 
obtained results, the foot equivalent link will be reshaped in order to improve the exoskeleton 
behavior during walking.

Exoskeleton Overview and Experimental Setup 
The proposed leg mechanism used on the exoskeleton structure has on its base two mechanisms. 
These are  a Chebyshev mechanism and a pantograph one according to [3]. A structural scheme and 
a virtual model of this is shown in Fig. 1. Basically the combination of the mentioned mechanisms 
lead to 1 actuator for 4 joints namely hip and knee joints from both legs.

b. 
Fig.1. The exoskeleton model used for walking: a – structural scheme of his leg; b- virtual model of 
the entire structure. 
 
This has the actuation link - 1 on the back with enough space to place a human body. Thus it is 
necessary only one actuator that can be placed in A joint on the body frame (0). In addition link 
sizes can be parameterized in order to adjust them for adapting to a large category of persons. 
Ankle joint is designed with no actuation, namely without a system that can substitute human 
ankle joint motion during gait. Due to this there are some additional ways to provide the necessary 
motion, but this represents another research theme which is not a part of the proposed analysis.  
The exoskeleton mechanism prototype was placed to a special mechanical device onto the frame 
of a treadmill. This is shown in Fig. 2 and the mechanical device consists on a several springs which 
can let the exoskeleton to lift up and down during walking on a vertical axis. This means that the 
exoskeleton mass centre will have the same behavior as the one of a human subject.  Also this type 
of mechanical device will maintain the entire exoskeleton fixed with the treadmill due to its own 
support frame. Thus in this case the pelvic link will be fixed in space, and the desired trajectories 
will be the one from the ankle and knee joints level. 
The video analysis equipment used on this research was CONTEMPLAS and it has on its 
structure two highs-peed video cameras which can be placed on the desired configuration for 
recording the video sequences. The video analysis scheme is shown in Fig. 3. Thus, one video 
camera is placed in a lateral side of the analyzed exoskeleton mechanism and the other one was 
placed above the experimental setup of the proposed research in such manner that this was be able 
to capture video- sequences of some markers from the treadmill and another from the foot link. 
With the second camera placed above it were collected trajectories developed in a transversal and 
longitudinal plane from the foot contact with the treadmill. 
Based on the proposed analysis there will be studied two types of foot shapes such as: flat foot 
and round foot. In this way it can be observed if the foot shape will have influence on the knee and 
hip joints trajectories during walking. The analyzed foot shapes are shown in Fig. 4.

In case of the human healthy subject this was analyzed in the same condition as the 
exoskeleton respectively on the same treadmill and with the hands fixed onto treadmill frame. Thus 
the hip joints will be fixed in space and the variation trajectories will be reported only for ankle and 
knee joints.

Experimental Analysis  
According to the equipment setup, on the exoskeleton mechanical structure were attached 8 
markers with reflective properties. Those markers represents the joint centers of the mechanism and 
one of them represents an attached marker on the foot which indicates the foot contact with the 
ground during walking. Another set of markers were attached on the treadmill conveyor at a 
distance of 20 millimeters and these represents the reference points for the above camera calibration 
(namely camera no.2).  
The collected data were acquired for a single gait and these consist in joint centre trajectories 
expressed in meters and angular amplitudes expressed in percentage of a full gait. Namely a single 
gait during walking recorded on the exoskeleton was between 0 to 2.24 seconds.  Photos of the 
CONTEMPLAS software during analysis are shown in Fig 5. There were performed 3 experiments 
which are: the first for the flat shape of the foot, the second for the round shape of the foot 
according to the Fig. 5 and the third one for a healthy subject with appropriate anthropometrical 
dimensions with the ones of the exoskeleton legs.

a- trajectories acquired with camera no 1 placed on the exoskeleton lateral side; b – trajectories 
acquired with camera no 2 placed above the exoskeleton. 
 
The obtained results represented by the trajectories for the analyzed cases are shown in diagrams 
from Fig. 6, Fig. 7 and Fig.8.  The analysis in case of a healthy human subject was performed for 
the same motion phase during walking as the exoskeleton.  
The global reference coordinate system was placed by the CONTEMPLAS Equipment software 
at the level of the pelvic segment for all experimental tests. 
On diagram from Fig.6 it can observed that the trajectory amplitude is around 15 millimeters, but 
the curves are totally different due to the shape of the foot. The nearest curve from the one 
developed by the healthy subject is represented by the round shape foot. Also this affects the knee 
joint behavior which can be observed on diagram shown in Fig. 7.   The diagram from Fig. 7 shows 
that the trajectory amplitude is around 45 millimeters and also the closest curve from the one 
generated by the healthy subject is the one of the model with a round shape. But here it can be 
remarked that on the swing phase the curve will not return on the same path.  On the diagram from 
Fig. 8 it can be seen a deviation between these curves of the analyzed cases. For the healthy subject 
the curvature has an angular deviation from a straight line and this was given by the foot orientation 
of the human in his postural position. On the other hand it can be remarked that in both exoskeleton 
cases the curves won’t return on the same path.

This can be caused by the fact that the exoskeleton mechanism does not carry a disabled person. 
Another reason of this can be given by the joints friction and inertia moments, which can affect the 
mechanism stiffness.   
Conclusions  
This paper describes a procedure for evaluating the behavior of an exoskeleton prototype during 
walking activity on a treadmill. Through this experimental remarks were obtained regarding the foot 
shape influence during walking. In particular, a high-speed motion analysis equipment has been 
used for measuring motion ranges of significant points from the exoskeleton mechanism and their 
behavior during contact between foot and ground. The experimental results show that the shape of 
the exoskeleton feet has an important role for its orientation in space. Moreover the shape of a foot 
link can modify trajectories and through this the ankle joint can be neglected due to the obtained 
satisfied results.

Abstract: The paper presents a graphical simulation system of the human spine developed using 
integrated MATLAB software. The application is based on real parameters of the human spine that 
can be modified and personalized during the analysis and all data are reported with respect to an 
ideal model of the human spine that is also personalized to the patient in cause. Given the fact that 
the human spine is one of the most complex systems in the human body a high attention must be 
paid at every aspect of its geometry and motion during the daily activities of the patient, this 
application enabling the monitoring of the majority of these aspects by analyzing data obtained 
from a special designed sensor system attached to the patient body. 
Introduction 
The spine is the most important segment of the locomotion system. It is linked to all the other 
segments of the trunk (thorax and pelvis), it articulates upper and lower limbs and supports the 
head. It provides the symmetry of the body and movement direction and it also enables the mobility 
and the stability of the body [1]. It has a complex heterogeneous structure resulting from the 
sequence of alternating vertebrae and intervertebral discs; it protects communication systems of the 
body and allows the mobility, and the stability of the body. It is also the only system that integrates 
bone, muscle and nervous tissues [1]. It is a very important segment with complex functionality, 
consisting of 33-34 pieces of bone, 344 joint surfaces, 24 intervertebral discs, 365 ligaments and 
730 points of origin and insertion of muscle bundles. The multi-segmented structure of the spine is 
determined by static and dynamic complex functions it performs: resistance to the forces of gravity, 
inertia, diversity of movements, distribution of segmental spinal nerves and support for the head [1]. 
The vertebrae are arranged into four topographical regions: cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacrum-
coccygeal, consisting of regional vertebras with certain morphological properties corresponding to 
each region. In each region the vertebras are adapted to specific dynamic conditions. The first two 
cervical vertebras have suffered substantial changes as a result of their role in achieving the 
mobility of the head. The vertebrae located between two regions integrate in their structure 
characters of both regions and are called transitional vertebrae. The abutment surfaces of the 
vertebral bodies grow from a vertebra to another in function of the load they have to carry. In the 
cervical and lumbar regions the transverse diameter of vertebral bodies is bigger than the anterior-
posterior diameter, which explains the higher capability of these regions to achieve flexion and 
extension movements meanwhile in the thoracic region the anterior-posterior diameter prevails. 
These particularities of the vertebras present a reflection of the position and the oscillation of the 
center of weight in usual static and dynamic conditions [1]. 
The paper is structured as follows: second section describes means of achieving the geometrical 
parameters of the human spine, the third part describes the application developed using integrated 
MATLAB software and the fourth part describes a special feature of the application specially 
developed for identifying diseases of the analyzed human spine.

Geometrical Parameters of the Human Spine 
 
 
Fig.1 The segmentation of the human spine [5]  
 
To be able to represent graphically the human spine one has to fully describe all the parameters 
of the system. In Fig.1 a simplified representation of the spine is shown. First step in the 
determination of the geometric parameters is to define a reference system regarding to which every 
parameter of the vertebrae will be reported. The point of origin of the coordinate system was chosen 
in the apex of the coccis and the vertebras parameters are nominated starting from the coccis, last 
sacrum vertebrae (S5) and ending with the first cervical vertebrae (C1). Every vertebra has been 
defined as having a center point to enable the representation of the spine because the vertebra will 
be drawn around this point. To be able to create this representation for every vertebra center point 8 
parameters were defined: 
 
 Cp =[R[dx dy dz ] h α β γ d]   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) 
 
all terms are shown in Fig.2 and defined below: 
 dx-represent displacement along x axis of the center point of the vertebra with 
respect to the defined reference system; 
 dy-represent displacement along y axis of the center point of the vertebra with 
respect to the defined reference system; 
 dz-represent displacement along z axis of the center point of the vertebra with respect 
to the defined reference system; 
 h-represents the height of the vertebral body; 
 α-represent the rotation angle of the vertebra around x axis; 
 β-represent the rotation angle of the vertebra around y axis; 
 γ -represent the rotation angle of the vertebra around z axis; 
 d-is the mean diameter of the vertebra;

SPINE-Graphical Simulation System 
Following the definition of the parameters of one vertebra the representation of the entire spine is 
achieved using a MATLAB developed application (Fig.3)  
 
Fig.3 User interface of the spine simulation software 
 
The main interface of the application consists in combining two spine models. In the left part of 
the window application are the ideal parameters of the human spine. These parameters are given by 
the physician and are based on the patient height, weight, sex and some lifestyle aspects that could 
demand a certain type of configuration for the ideal spine model. All parameters are given in the 
form of a table. Each line of the table represents a vertebra, for cervical spine C1 to C7, for thoracic 
spine T1 to T12, for lumbar spine L1 to L5, for the sacral spine S1 to S5 and the last line are the 
parameters of the coccis bone, mainly where the reference system of application is placed. 
On the right part of the main application window is placed a table containing the real parameters 
of the spine personalized to the patient under analysis. This table is populated with data collected 
from a special monitoring system equipped with sensors that supply all the relevant data for the 
application. The monitoring system collects data from the human patient along a period of 24 hours 
Applied Mechanics and Materials Vol. 823

recording all his postures and records them to enable their download at the end of the day. By 
introducing all this data into the developed application the wrong postures of the spine can by 
identified and using a medical protocol posture corrections are suggested for the patient. 
In the middle of the user interface, is a panel representing the human spine, having as parameters 
data from the left side table of the application. This representation of the spine uses the ideal model, 
the structure that should be achieved by monitoring the motion of the real spine. Data from the right 
table represents the actual values read by the special designed device, and represented on the same 
graphic to enable the representation of the differences between the ideal and the real models.  
The application also enables the possibility to modify the parameters of one or more vertebras and 
to visualize the way that the curvature of the spine changes only by modifying a displacement of a 
vertebra or an angle. 
Another feature of the application is the rotating viewport of the graphic. For a better view of the 
curvature of the spine, the graph has the possibility to rotate around its vertical axis .This feature is 
implemented in the lower part of the window , below the spine graphic and gives the possibility to 
rotate the view with 360 degrees. 
 
 
Fig.3 Patient input data window 
The application has the option to create a database with the patients that are monitored. As it can 
be seen in Fig. 3 the patient has to provide name, gender, age, height, weight and some additional 
information (medical recommendations) given by his physician for improving his posture. 
The window is also equipped with buttons for saving data provided as the ideal parameters of the 
vertebras and real parameters of the vertebras and a button to initialize the diagnose window, 
feature which is described below. 
Diagnose Tool 
The main purpose of this application is represented by this final feature entitled Diagnose Tool. 
This feature combines all the data introduced by the physician and data obtained from the 
monitoring device correlated with patient data. The final objective of this tool is to analyze the data 
obtained and compare them with a series of spine affections such as: discopathies, spondylosis, 
scalene muscles syndrome, cervical rib syndrome, Lumbago, spondylitis, herniated disc, cauda 
equina syndrome, sciatica, fibromyalgia (fibrosis), Tietze syndrome, osteophytes (parrot beaks), 
Scheuermann disease, scoliosis, kyphosis, Kypho-scoliosis and this database can be enhanced by 
defining new illnesses to analyze (illnesses based on geometric posture of the spine). The 
application enables the user to choose one or more affections to analyze by simply checking a check 
box case.

Fig.4 Diagnose tool window  
 
After the illness has been selected the operator has to press the ‘Start Analyze’ button and the 
application starts to compare data based on the ideal parameters obtained from the physician with 
the data obtained from measuring system. In the case that some parameters are wrong the 
application has the possibility to stop the analysis and return to the main window to modify these 
erroneous parameters and after that the operator can resume the analysis with the new corrected 
parameters. If the operator is not satisfied with the data obtained after the analyze process he has the 
possibility to clear all the results obtained or if the data are correct he can save the results. Before 
deleting or saving the results, the operator has the possibility to visualize the results. If the operator  
needs to check some other patient results he can simply change the patient and all the data will be 
actualized to the new patient without having to reintroduce all the parameters needed for the 
analyze, because the application has the option to create a database with  the patients and their data.

In Fig.5 can be seen a result of the graphical simulation of the spine. Parameters of both tables 
have been compared and after the use of the diagnose tool the featured representations resulted. The 
yellow line represents the ideal model of the spine and the blue line is the real model of the spine. In 
the left picture can be observed a deviation of the spine in the frontal plane that occurs in the lumbar 
zone this is a clear case of lumbar scoliosis. On the right plane can be seen a deviation in the sagittal 
plane that occurs in the thoracic spine this affection of the spine is called kyphosis. 
Conclusions 
An application for monitoring and analysis of the behavior of the human spine during the patient 
movement has been developed and presented above. The application is part of a project meant to 
monitor the human spine along a period of time and record data about the postures of the vertebras. 
The application is based on an ideal geometrical model of the human spine and it uses parameters 
recorded from the monitoring system to analyze possible affections of the spine.

Keywords: virtual knee prosthesis, total knee arthroplasty, finite element method, antero-posterior 
tibial slope  
Abstract: In this paper, using 3D finite element method and starting from the virtual model of the 
human knee joint-prosthesis assembly, we investigate the effects of antero-posterior tibial slope on 
contact stresses in the three components of total knee prosthesis. Using AnsysWorkbench15.07 
software, the stress and displacements maps are obtained for knee-prosthesis assemblies and for 
their components, considering two loading force: 800N and 2400N and two cases of prosthetic knee 
varus slope: 176o and b) 191o. For each prosthesis-knee assembly and for each considered force, 
two variants of antero-posterior tibial slope were considered: 00 and 50.  
Introduction  
Virtual models of human knee joint were analyzed with finite element method in order to study the 
tibio–femoral contact area, the stress and displacements developed in the human knee joint under 
different solicitations. Virtual modeling of human knee joint has been addressed in several articles 
[1-4].  
The finite element method is becoming one of the most important tools in orthopaedic 
biomechanics and it is used to evaluate biomechanical behavior of prosthetic knee, to evaluate and 
compare the proposed design of a custom femoral component with a conventional design, to 
evaluate the tibio-femoral contact stress, to estimate the contact area, the contact pressure and the 
stress status of the polyethylene tibial components [5-13]. The effects of antero-posterior tibial 
slope developed during tibial resection in total knee arthroplasty were studied as an important factor 
in the knee biomechanics [14-18].  
The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of antero-posterior tibial slope on contact 
stresses in all components of total knee prosthesis using 3D finite element analysis.  
3D virtual model of total knee prosthesis 
Using advanced commands available in Design Modeler, a preprocessor of AnsysWork-
bench15.07 software [19], the virtual model of knee prosthesis was constructed starting from the 
shapes and dimensions of the original Stryker type knee prosthesis [9, 17]. The main commands 
used to elaborate the 3D virtual models of the prosthesis components are:  
- 
New Plan – creating new plans necessary for inserting design drawings of lines; 
- 
New Sketch: creating new planes in the created sketches, forming contours to be extruded;  
- 
Extrude: solid design based on profiles of lines designed in drawings; 
- 
Unite (Boolean Operation): gathering solids in one solid; at geometrical level transformation 
is performed at the points, lines and surfaces; 
- 
Fblend – design  of uniform connections on marginal surfaces of solid;

- 
Merge – gathering surfaces to eliminate certain small areas which hinder the meshing in 
knots and elements of good quality; 
- 
Revolve – Boolean operation of a solid design based on a profile and a direction of rotation; 
with this operation was conducted the inner cylindrical channel; 
- 
Substract – Boolean operation of extracting one solid from another;    
 
With commands New Plan, Extrude, Slice, Unite, a thickening of the proximal zone of tibial 
component and of distal area of polyethylene insert was done. Using tools for checking the possible 
geometrical errors, spaces and penetrations of the prosthesis components were removed. Contact 
surfaces were created between the femoral component and the polyethylene insert using assembly 
operations of small areas to achieve a network of nodes and elements of constant size and good 
quality.

Lateral view. 
The virtual model of the knee prosthesis was exported in the prosthesis–joint assembly model, 
being made a correct positioning of the prosthesis model. The virtual models of the assembly 
prosthesis-knee joint have been developed for two cases: knee joint with varus slope of 176o and 
191o, respectively, and for each of these cases, two sub-cases are studied: with anterior-posterior 
tibial slope equal to 0o and, respectively, equal to 5o. 
  
             
  
 
Figure 2. Prosthesis-knee joint with anterior-posterior slope of 0o with varus slope:a) 176o; b) 191o 
 
To achieve the 3D virtual models of joint-prosthesis assembly presenting varus slope of 191o the 
following approach for calculating the angle between the tibia and femur was used: the mechanical 
axis of the tibia is kept in the same position; the mechanical axis of the femur was inclined with 15o. 
After cutting the tibial bone in antero-posterior direction with a slope of 5o, tibial prosthesis was 
repositioned to the new sloped location.

Thus the femur and femoral prosthesis were repositioned to be assured the contact surfaces

Boundary and control conditions for analysis are the following: 
 virtual running time for analysis was set to 1 second; 
 due to the presence of nonlinear contact and the large number of nodes and elements the 
analysis in a sub-steps system is implemented: 10 subsets, initial step 1 or step up to 100; 
 solver has been set as the iterative type by “Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient”, level 2; 
 the main movements of the femur to the tibia, femur rotation movement on the head of the 
tibia, and the possibility of movement of the tibia at the ankle joint were considered; 
 using “Remote Displacement”, for hip joint  rotation movement after Y axis and translation 
after Z axis were established; translations after X, Y, respectively rotations around X, Z axis 
are considered equal to 0; DOF = 2, (DOF means “Degree Of Freedom”); 
 a “Remote Displacement” holder allows rotation around the Y axis, which compensates the 
possibility of movement in the ankle joint; all other displacements and revolute movements 
have been set as 0; DOF = 1; 
 a distributed force of 800 N was applied on -Z direction; 
 
The materials characteristics used for human knee joint components and for prosthesis 
components are presented in Table 1.

Results  
Using AnsysWorkbench 15.07 software [3,4,7,18], the numerical simulations and Finite Element 
Method analyses were processed for the eight analysed cases of knee joint-prosthesis assemblies 
with antero-posterior slope of 0o and 5o respectively. The variants of 0o and 5o tibial slope were 
chosen because Stryker Company offers both variants of complete surgical instruments for total 
knee arthroplasty.

Clinical observations show that for the case of 5o tibial slope is easier for surgeons to mount the 
knee prosthesis components during total knee arthroplasty and, after surgical act, the flexion 
movement is improved (the range of motion increases).  
Two loading forces were taken into consideration: 800 N  and 2400 N. The maximum values of 
von Mises stresses, developed in all three prosthesis components were extracted for the eight 
studied cases. The total and lateral displacements of knee-prosthesis assembly are also obtained. 
Considering a loading force equal to 800N, these values are presented in Table 2.  For a loading 
force equal to 2400N the maximum values of stresses and displacements are presented in Table 3.

From Table 2 and Table 3, we can see that the von Mises stress obtained for 0o antero-posterior 
slope are increased by comparing them with the same values obtained for 5o antero-posterior slope. 
The stress values obtained for a varus slope of 176 o are increased comparing with the case of 191o. 
Clinical observations show that for the case of 5o tibial slope, the post-surgical knee behaviour is 
improved, so, the numerical results confirm these observations. 
Conclusions 
Using AnsysWorkbench15.07 software, the stress and displacements maps are obtained for all 
analyzed knee-prosthesis assemblies. The Finite Element Method is used to obtain the diagrams and 
the maximum values of von Mises stress and displacements. The virtual models of the prosthetic 
knee joints presented in this paper can be used for future research in the following directions: 
▪Post-surgical kinematic and dynamic analysis of  prosthetic knee joint;  
▪Post-surgical analysis using FEA method; 
▪Studies of implants and prosthetics optimization function of dimensions, material, shapes, 
maximum stress, etc. 
▪Studies for improving the performances of endoprosthetic devices.

Abstract. In this paper the effects of varus tilt on contact stresses in the three components of total 
knee prostheses using 3D finite element analysis were investigated. Using Ansys simulation 
environment, six complex virtual models of human knee joint–prosthesis assembly obtained for six 
different varus tilts which increase from 176o  to 191o with an increment of 30, have been subjected 
to finite element analysis in order to obtain the stress maps and total displacements maps. 
Introduction 
The finite element method is becoming one of the most important tools in orthopedic biomechanics, 
this method being used to analyze   stresses and displacements of human bones and joints. Virtual 
modeling of human knee joint has been addressed in several articles [1-6]. 
Virtual models were analyzed with FEM, after performing a finite element model with 
tetrahedral type, hexahedral, or using automatic meshing methods [1-10]. With the advances in 
computer technology and software, the applications of finite element analysis have been expanded 
to simulation of total knee arthroplasty motion and strength, investigation of contact stress and wear 
mechanisms in artificial prostheses [5-10]. 
The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of varus tilt on contact stresses in the 
three components of total knee prostheses using 3D finite element analysis. Six complex virtual 
models of prosthetic human knee joint with varus tilt increasing from 176o to 191o by adding an 
increment equal with 3o were elaborated, meshed and analyzed. 
3D virtual models  
The normal human knee joint is featured by a 176 o angle between femur and tibia bones. Six 3D 
virtual models have been developed for prosthetic knee joint that include the following components: 
femur, tibia and three knee prosthesis components. To design the virtual model of the knee 
prosthesis, the Design Modeler application which is a pre-processor of Ansys Workbench 15.07 is 
used [11] We have taken into account the 3D virtual model of healthy knee joint (Figure 2) 
elaborated by our team based on CT images [3-5].

Finite element analysis is statically nonlinear, nonlinearity being present through nonlinear 
contacts between the upper surfaces of the polyethylene insert and lower surfaces of the femoral 
prosthesis component. Modification and correct positioning of the components has been achieved in 
the simulation environment of the application AnsysWorkbench15.07. Components positioning 
requires an appropriate distance between them and also a correct geometric structure. Defining 
minimum and maximum dimensions of the elements, various analysis settings and contact areas 
settings, in order to avoid gaps or penetrations between components, are necessary for optimal and 
faster solution.  
     The discretization of the geometrical model in nodes and elements was performed with 
hexahedron-type elements of Solid186 type and tetrahedron-type elements of Solid 187 type, both 
being solid elements with a supplementary node positioned in the middle. The nodes placed in the 
middle are very useful for a better approximation of results and for a higher accuracy.  
"Sweep" method was used for prosthesis components in order to divide the model in 
hexahedron-type elements, which automatically control the direction of formation of elements from 
the source to the area of interest. For very complex areas, advanced discretization methods, such as 
"HexDominant" and "PatchComforming", which are methods of combining hexahedron and 
tetrahedron elements, are used.  
Hexahedron-type elements were used for prosthesis components, and tetrahedral elements with 
node in the middle were used for femur and tibia. For efficient discretization, for this analysis, 
elements with dimensions of 1.5 mm and 1 mm respectively, were used for the areas of maximum 
interest, and finite elements with the size equal to 4 mm were used for the other areas. The 
discretization is performed for each of six virtual model of prosthetic knee joint.  
The number of nodes and finite elements achieved for the 6 complex geometrical models are 
presented in Table 1.

Results 
Values for maximum equivalent VonMises stresses, total and directional movements that occur 
throughout the assembly and on individual components were extracted for the set of results. We are 
interested to obtain and compare the maximum values of stresses and displacements obtained for 
human knee-prosthesis assembly and for prosthesis components. Six analyses were carried out for 
all the designed models on the entire knee joint–prosthesis assembly for a force of 800N. For 
example, in Fig.3 the results obtained for joint–prosthesis assembly with varus tilt of 176o, total 
displacement is equal with 3.09 mm and the maximum value of VonMises stress is 15.09 MPa.

Conclusions 
In this paper the effects of varus tilt on contact stresses in the three components of total knee 
prostheses using 3D finite element analysis are analysed. Six complex virtual models of prosthetic 
human knee joint with varus tilt increasing from 176o to 191o by adding an increment equal with 
3o were elaborated, meshed and analyzed. Analyzing the table values we can see that as the angle 
of varus increase from 1760 to 1910 the stresses values increase in all prosthesis components. While 
design and surgical technique for total knee replacement progress, a better understanding of normal 
and prosthetic knee joint stresses distributin will provide the potential to improve  the implant 
longevity and functionality.

Abstract. Evolution of accidentology science, computer engineering and systems of data collection 
and processing has allowed in recent years, development of border areas that make the connection 
between life sciences and engineering. 
This paper tries to prove that this link exists and can be emphasized by using scientific instruments. 
In recent years, following the development of the automotive industry has increased the need for 
design and development of systems for testing biofidelity impact of vehicles, since the phase of the 
virtual model or prototype "zero", with visible effects in improving the safety of road users. 
In general, it is considered that the development of automotive mannequins to test different types of 
impact, will lead to continuous improvement of safety of the driver and passengers. 
Introduction 
Anthropometry and its role with the increasing standard of living, human body size evolved in 
many countries in recent decades. To ensure that clothing, work spaces, transport and leisure 
activities correspond to current measures of persons, guaranteeing them at the same time, comfort 
and safety, ISO has published a report containing the updated anthropometric data (measures the 
human body in different population groups). 
In ISO / TR 7250-2: 2010 are presented definitions of basic measures for technological design of 
the human body, the human body statistical summaries of measures of individual ISO populations. 
Anthropometric data and weight distribution in human body parts necessary to build three-
dimensional mathematical models so as anthropomorphic test dummies and there is a database for 
all models of anthropomorphic dummies used in testing; these include body sizes, locations of 
joints, weight distribution for all age groups (data obtained through the techniques 
stereophotografy), sex, weight, age; junctions human skeleton centers were obtained by estimation.

Hybrid III 95th male, Large Male Dummy, was originally developed by First Technology Safety 
Systems and the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), Biomechanics Subcommittees and Ohio 
State University. 
The dummy represents the largest segment of the adult population and is based on USA 
anthropometry studies. Originally developed in 1988, the dummy is used worldwide for the 
evaluation of automotive and military safety restraints and particularly for seat belt integrity testing.  
Hybrid III dummy's neck is a rubber and aluminum construction cable center. Now accurately 
simulates flexion / rotation of human dynamics and response to extension [3].

The neck consists of 5 vertebrae, the aluminium alloy, which have 4 zones intervertebral from an 
elastic material (rubber). Lower flange connects with the upper torso of the dummy. Upper flange, 
C1 will link the dummy head. The middle area throughout the whole of the neck is crossed by a 
cable of steel, tensioned by means of a press that provides rigidity of the entire system of the 
cervical spine area. 
For concentricity in areas where cable could have contact with her throat bushings are fixed two 
insulators. The top of the cable has a fixed bushing attached to the cable, which will be based on a 
flat washer or a grower washer. On the opposite side, in the lower flange of the cable ends with a 
threaded sleeve, the rigidity of the system being achieved by tightening a nut. 
 
The proposed experimental cervical biofidelic (Fig.1b) 
Technical system refers to the achievement of a biofidelic neck of dummies for experimental 
tests that can be used any field of medical interest, technically. When designing the technical system 
was started from the study of existing technical systems to date. From studying patents have been 
obtained following observations regarding their drawbacks:  
- Technical construction quite cumbersome;  
- Many spinal cord construction made up of a plurality of mechanical devices;  
- Can not simulate all the movements of a human throat, but only some of them. The technical 
system type "biofidelic neck" of a test dummy, which by its construction (both vertebrae and 
intervertebral discs) meet in a heavily technical features

- Structural, mechanical and human ones, and the use of elastic elements drive enabling cervical 
muscle during tests simulating collisions of vehicles.  
Biofidelic cervical technical system has the following advantages: 
- The intervertebral discs are made of a material having the physicochemical properties and 
mechanical viscous-elastic properties compatible with the human intervertebral disc; 
- Simulates both flexion and extension test dummy's head; 
- Simulating the movement of rotation of the neck biofidelic; 
- Simulates the lateral movements of the neck;  
The system consists of seven cervical vertebrae biofidelic, each with a customized design, four 
intervertebral discs, elastic elements of shape memory materials (Shape Memory Alloy), fixed to the 
cervical vertebrae, which simulates the action of neck muscles and a drive mechanism biofidelic 
neck which may allow rotation around its own axis, with the ability to achieve combined 
movements of these elements used. 
For the explanation of cervical biofidelic system as shown in the practical realization of the neck 
biofidelic (Figure 1b), indicating that all of the cervical vertebrae C1-C7 have different constructive 
forms, which allow to fix the draw springs of shape memory. Shape memory alloys are typically 
functional materials, being more important what they do (take action) than by what they are (a 
property). 
The  properties that distinguish these classic materials are multiple: 
- resumption freely shape: memory materials resume their original shape when heated above the 
critical temperature after a plastic deformation property called shape memory effect simple.  
Thus, the coil springs made from memory alloys grow very small but large amplitude, while the disc 
spring and the bars are obtained high strength and small amplitudes. 
- Resumption form in restrictive conditions: memory element is prevented to alter the shape of 
heating and because of this, it produces a voltage.  
- Producing work (force and displacement) only heating the shape memory element; 
- pseudoelasticity: above a critical temperature it is possible to  store a significant amount of 
potential energy due to a large reversible deformation. high vibration damping capacity under a 
critical temperature.  
All these properties are related to a thermoelastic martensitic transformation with a relatively low 
hysteresis. Transformation temperature is very sensitive to the composition of the alloy and can be 
chosen between ± 1500ºC current systems Ni-Ti alloys, Cu-Zn-Al, Cu-Al-Ni. 
The advantages of using shape memory alloys as actuators active elements (in order) are: 
- Small: a necessity in robots; 
- Interference-free operation: beneficial both mechanically and electrically as; 
- The possibility of controlled action; 
- Fiability: active element shape memory alloy phase properties to preserve the initial defaults.  
In [5] the main properties and medical applications of Shape memory alloys are presented. The 
adaptive modular implants based on smart materials represent a superior solution in the 
osteosynthesis of the fractured bones over the conventional implants known so far.  
In papers [6,8], theoretical and experimental results and  advantages of the modular adaptive 
implants based on SMA are presented. 
The composition of cervical biofidelic the test dummy road accidents is composed of seven 
vertebrae in the literature noted that the point C (cervical) followed by a numerical subscript 
representing the position of the vertebra 1 to 7, respectively: C1 - C7 [14]. 
The cervical biofidelic is composed of three sub-assemblies, denoted by A1, A2, and A3. 
Hardening of the whole system is performed by a cervical steeled cable that ends with a threaded 
area and, using a nut, it can get the required stiffening of the vertebrae C3-C7 group. The elastic 
elements 12 are between vertebra C2 and C1 vertebra eccentric piece. 
Hardening of the neck biofidelic technical system according to the required test can be achieved 
by means of a steeled cable 13 terminated by a threaded bush, by tightening with a nut.

A3 subassembly consists of elastic members 22 of shape memory materials (Shape Memory 
Alloys), which are driven by an electronic device, giving them the possibility of contracting or

Experimental part 
More tests were conducted using multiple angles pendulum original, which can be divided into 
two large groups: cranio-cervical classic system testing and system testing cranio-cervical biofidelic 
that can be used in the composition test dummies auto accident. 
The two experiments were carried out with the following conditions: 
- The ambient air temperature 22-23ºC; 
- To maintain a proper illumination was used 2200W projectors being mounted four, two fixed 
supports.  
The projectors were focused on the technical device testing [10,13]; 
- Humidity of about 40%;  
- Between two successive attempts to leave a period of about 30 minutes;  
- Five determinations were made for each type of cranio-cervical (classic and biofidelic); 
Accelerometers with gyro used MPU 6050 were fixed on the cranio-cervical system elements

After comparative tests to determine the behavior of the two necks tested for exemplifying the 
many angles of impact testing device (Fig. 3 a - d). Every angle of the impactor corresponding to a 
certain speed of impact. Note that the behavior of human near much is determined by the neck

Conclusion  
The mannequins for testing new car models that can appear on the market, and to determine the 
dynamics of a road accident, have one deficiency: can not repeat entirely human behavior behind the 
wheel. Current dummies used in automotive, aerospace component missing their muscular system, 
circulatory, nervous. The behavior of shape memory alloy springs can say that the system is 
approaching the cervical biofidelic human, regarding the muscular system. Such behavior test 
dummy approaching that of the human and also can be said that such can establish a new model - 
adaptive dummy.

Keywords: wavelet transform, energy level, osteoarthritis knee
Abstract. In this research proposal we want to develop from kinematic data, measures using the
wavelets theory to characterize normal and osteoarthritis knee locomotion. The kinematic data of the
radio-carpal flexion-extension angles were analyzed using the wavelet transform. The experimental
data was acquired with a complex goniometer system. The detail energy for the level 5 is an important
factor to characterize the osteoarthritis patients and normal subjects.
Introduction
The Wavelet Packet Transform is a time frequency analysis tools that brings the signal into a domain
that contains both time and frequency information [1]. Generally, time frequency analysis is made by
using Fast Fourier Transform analysis in short windows. Development of wavelet transforms [2, 3]
and wavelet package [4, 5] contributed specifically to signal representation and to transient and non
stationary signal analysis ans synthesis [6, 7]. Wavelet packet decomposition is a wavelet transform
where the signal is passed through more filters and it allows analyzing a signal at different resolution
levels [7]. The discrete wavelet transform provides an efficient representation for a broad range of real-
world signals, each level being calculated by passing the previous approximation coefficients through
high and low pass filters [7]. This property has been exploited to develop powerful signal de-noising
and estimation methods [8]. Lanovaz and Watson used discrete wavelet transforms to study different
frequency components of accelerometer data acquired from the forelimbs of horses [9].
Sloboda and Zatsiorsky used a wavelet transform to represent ground reaction force (GRF) data
in jogging for two human subjects [11].
Wavelet Theory
The continuous wavelet transform transform of a scalar function f(t) : R →R with respect to a
wavelet g, is defined as [12]
Tg,a,b(f) = 1
a
+∞
∫
−∞
f(t) g
(t −b
a
)
dt
(1)
and depends on the point b, and also on the magnification 1/a. The scale or dilation parameter is a and
the translation parameter is b. For a particular case of when a and b are power of 2 (a = 2i and b = p a
with i, p ∈Z) the continuous wavelet transform becomes a discrete wavelet transform. The wavelet
transform works by scaling and translating of the wavelet functions. For discrete signals the discrete
wavelet transform will decompose the signal in a series of approximation and detail functions. For a
level 5 of decomposition an initial signal can be written as
s = A5 +

Fig. 1: Mean values of the knee angle during a gait cycle
where A5 is the approximation function and Di are the detail functions. The analyzed signals
are decomposed using Daubechies’s wavelet functions (db8 type in MATLAB). In general, the com-
ponents at the lower levels are coarse and of low frequency. With the aid of the inverse transform
components of similar trajectories that are reconstructed at the same level can be compared. Another
property of importance is the energy distribution of the original signal over each level of the transform.
For any signal, its energy would be defined as the mean squared value of the signal. Due to the orthog-
onal properties of the wavelet transform, the total energy of the original signal would be preserved and
can be represented as a sum of the energy of coefficients or wavelet levels. A quantitative measure of
the energy distribution by each component can be obtained as the sum of the squared coefficients in
that particular level. A comparison of the contribution of energy by each level can reveal anomalies
in the gait patterns [14].

Results
We analyze the goniometer signals obtained for the knee motion and we compare, using wavelet theory,
the energy levels obtained from the decomposition for three cases: healthy subjects, patients with knee
osteoarthritis (OA), and patients with healthy knee. The mean values for the knee angle for the three
cases during a gait cycle are shown in Fig. 1.
The approximation function of the knee angle is A5 and the detail functions are D5 for level 5, D4
for level 4, D3 for level 3, D2 for level 2 and D1 for level 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The initial signals can
be written as Eq. 2.
The detail function for the level 5 is shown in Fig. 3 and the detail function for the level 4 is shown
in Fig. 4. The detail function for the level 3 is shown in Fig. 5. We can compare the three cases using
the detail functions for levels 5 and 4 for the whole gait cycle using as shown in Figs. 3 and 4 . The
detail function for the levels 3 does not reveal many differences for healthy subjects, patients with OA
knee , and patients with healthy knee.
We can also compare the detail functions at a specific period of the gait cycle. For the instant of
maximum angle of the knee angle the values of the detail functions D5 and D4 are shown in in Fig. 6.
Next we will compute the energy levels corresponding to each signal, as shown in Fig. 7. The
energy values are calculated as the average for all healthy subjects and patients. The energy values
corresponding to the levels 1, 2, and 3 are very small. For the level 4 the energy level for the healthy
patients is smaller compare to OA patients and healthy patients. For this level the energy of healthy
patients is greater than the energy of OA patients. Better results are obtained if we compare the energies
at the level 5. For the level 4 the energy level for the healthy patients is smaller compare to healthy
patients and the energy for the healthy patients is smaller than the OA patients.

Conclusions
The goal of this research was to find a relation between OA patients, healthy patients, and healthy
subjects and the wavelet transform of the knee angle. The detail energy of the level 5 decreases with
the instability in the knee. The ability to analyze the wavelet transform on individuals has the potential
to provide insight into normal and abnormal motions in humans.

Keywords: virtual hip, hip prosthesis, finite elements method, stress maps 
Abstract. In this paper the main steps for defining a virtual prosthetic hip are presented. Based on 
direct measurement method used in first step, each of the hip prosthesis components were 
generated, one by one, in SolidWorks software. These components were included in the virtual 3D 
biomechanical hip system. The entire model was divided in finite elements. Starting from this 3D 
model, the goal of the research is to determine new geometries and optimized solutions for an 
innovative hip prosthesis. Also, the stress maps for the normal walking in the prosthetic hip were 
determined. 
Introduction 
 
One of the most powerful tools usually used to analyze the stresses and displacements of human 
musculoskeletal system, but, also, of human joints-prosthesis assemblies is Finite Element Method 
[1-6]. Application of the finite element (FE) method for joint replacement was first completed using 
a femoral hip prosthesis in the late 1970s [1]. The first anatomically correct three-dimensional 
femur model with hip prosthesis was completed by Huiskes et al. [2]. The last decade has seen 
increased mesh resolution simulations, non-linear material models, and contact analysis to increase 
realism [3-11]. 
The Virtual Model of the Hip Prosthesis 
To determine the geometric parameters of the prosthesis components made by Groupe Lepine, we 
used direct measurement method. Also, we identified the spatial profiles of each component. 
Having determined the size of geometric elements of hip prosthesis, SolidWorks [7], parameterized 
software for three-dimensional models, was used. Using specific commands, sketch drawing plane 
is obtained (Fig. 2). Using the Insert command Boss / Base Extrude Depth parameter and assigning 
(from left window shape-defining) the amount of 9 mm solid is obtained.

On the basis form we attached another additional form. In Fig. 3, a) the main steps of defining 
the stem model of hip prosthesis are shown. Finally, we have obtained the stem model of hip 
prosthesis shown in Fig. 3, b).

The Virtual Model of the Hip Joint Prosthesis 
To obtain the virtual model of the prosthetic hip joint, the surgical techniques were studied. We 
started from the virtual biomechanical system of both human legs elaborated in [13]. The 
implantation is preceded by removal of bone and cartilage in both affected bones: femur bone and 
pelvic bone. In a first phase, we removed the neck and the femoral head using a phisiological plane

inclined at 45° to the sagittal plane. The femur model prepared for implantation is similar to that 
shown in Fig. 6.

To have a correctly entering of the stem prosthesis, the intramedullary canal was virtual widened, 
assuming a similar shape to that of the femoral stem (Fig. 6). In a sharp pelvic bone was performed 
similar spherical outer surface as the polyethylene cup (Fig. 7). Finally, using movement and simple 
geometric constraints, but based on orthopedic information (sagittal angle of 45° and anteversion 
angle of 12° for the polyethylene cup) was obtained prosthetic hip joint model, shown in Figure 7.

The Finite Elements Biomechanical System of the Prosthetic Hip  
The dividing operation into finite elements for analyzed biomechanical system was performed 
under the same conditions (Fig. 9) [4,5,6]. 
 
Fig. 9. The biomechanics system of the hip joint prosthetic divided into finite elements 
 
To obtain the mesh structure, the finite elements of tetrahedron type have been used and their 
network distribution for entire biomechanical prosthetic hip model contains a total of 128,446 
elements and 23,125 nodes. This model can be used to determine the behavior of biomechanical 
system components in different situations. All results will be suposed to critical analysis.

For pelvic bone and for femur bone the material properties were assumed to be homogeneous. 
Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for trabecular and cortical bone were taken to be 70 MPa and 
0.2, and 17 GPa and 0.3, respectively. For femur bone, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for 
trabecular and cortical bone were taken 500 MPa and 0.3, respectively, 18.6 GPa and 0.3 [9-11]. 
For prosthesis components titanium alloy (Young's modulus equal to 110 GPa) is used, due to 
its lower modulus, superior biocompatibility and enhanced corrosion resistance when compared to 
more conventional stainless steels and cobalt-based alloys.  
The Simulation of the Prosthetic Virtual Hip 
First, it is intended to use in ANSYS simulation the evolution of force from kinematic 
simulation presented in [1]. A digitized model of the force was defined in order to be used in 
different applications. The Excel file illustrates the evolution of the femur force function of time and 
it is used for simulations in ANSYS software [12] which is based on the finite element method (Fig. 
10).

After running the application, data tables, charts and dynamic graphs dynamic (simulation films) 
were obtained. In Fig. 11 the stress maps for the entire analyzed system were presented. Maximum 
value of stress for the entire analyzed system was 5.2189ˑ106 Pa.

Conclusions and Future Work 
Biomechanical systems, as the prosthetic hip, can be developed in three-dimensional 
environment and can be exported to simulation software, can be analyzed and virtual tested. Finite 
element modeling enables the evaluation of stress distribution throughout the hip prostheses and an 
assessment of geometries and material properties which would be difficult to test experimentally. 
Finite element method allows obtaining stress maps and displacements maps in different complex 
situations. Using these models, our research team planned to develop the next lines:

Abstract. To generate a virtual human hip is a main goal for our research team. Also, starting from 
the normal virtual hip joint and using the important orthopedics information was defined the 
affected hip joint. All these models were generated in a 3D virtual environment starting with 
Computer Tomograph (CT) scanning images. Using an original method all the scanned CT images 
were re-defined and re- drawn and transferred to the 3D software. The resulted curves were used to 
generate the bones and the virtual complex system of both hip joints. With motion and geometric 
constrains the bio-mechanical assemblies were defined, starting from anatomical information. The 
normal hip joint and the model of the affected hip were defined and exported to ANSYS, software 
based on Finite Element Analysis. 
Introduction 
In 1972, fifteen years after the launch of the finite element analysis method FEM (Finite Elements 
Method) which initiated a "revolution" in the study of mechanical structures, it was introduced to 
study the behavior of skeletal elements and entered into medical literature [1]. Mathematical tools 
provided by classical mechanics to calculate the stress and deformation are not exactly suitable for 
irregular geometry and complicated structures such as human bones. Using the finite element 
method has become, in a logical progression, appropriate tool for getting results in complicated 
structures with variable loads and nonlinear material properties [2]. Obviously, the first FEM 
analysis was unnoticed in academical reports, but practical applications used in prosthetics analysis 
or bone fixation offered a real support for orthopedics. At the same time, this revolutionary method 
has generated new questions and new answers, and stimulating research environments with 
exponential growth in recent decades.  
This innovative method, with strong roots in mathematics and engineering, was used in bone 
virtual reconstruction, for testing and optimization of artificial joints obtained by prosthetic fixation 
simulations, to determine the "soft" elements behavior such as ligaments, cartilage and 
intervertebral discs [2-6]. 
Using computer aided design (CAD) and dynamic simulation software it was possible to develop 
a virtual model of the human hip joint in order to be used for "in vitro" biomechanical simulations. 
This "in vitro” model includes the bone components with attached corresponding materials and the 
solid bodies which will be considered flexible. The three-dimensional human hip model  was 
generated based on the assumption that the contact surface between pelvis and femur is spherical 
and articulation between the femoral head and acetabulum is concentric. This assumption is 
appropriate for normal hips [7-9]. Constrains movements were defined and hip joint was assumed to 
be a spherical joint.

The Virtual Model of the Normal Hip Joint 
The hip joint study begins with a computer tomography (CAT scan) performed on a 55 years old 
adult male patient at the County Emergency Hospital of Craiova using a CAT scan manufactured by 
Siemens, Emotion model. CT scan or CAT scan is an imaging technique that uses X-rays to scan the 
internal structures of the body and to make detailed pictures of the analyzed items. The device is 
called Computer Tomograph and consists of two components: a scanner (the device that scans using 
X-rays) and the computer which acquires the data to create cross-sectional images.  
To generate the virtual components of the hip joint were analyzed 275 tomographic images 
obtained in different parallel planes. It has been used a single scan scheme: the parallel transverse 
planes with the distance of 2.5 mm. 
To organize, process and manage the CT images was used the built-in Syngo FastView software, 
developed by Siemens. To use the possibility to compare and report the three-dimensional model to 
a fixed virtual landmark (coordinate system) and to achieve a proper modeling scale, the distance 
superimposed over CT image has been compared with the size obtained by direct loading into a 
drawing program like AutoCAD. In Fig. 1 twelve images obtained in different transverse planes 
using scanning scheme are presented. 
 
Fig. 1 Twelve important images obtained by scanning scheme transverse plane 
 
To define virtual models of the bone components was used SolidWorks software, of the most 
used 3D CAD parametric software [10], which allows to import operations for the two-dimensional 
drawings in different planes and, after that, to obtain three-dimensional models. These models can 
be edited and transferred to kinematic simulation programs or to the finite element analysis 
software. The sections obtained by drawing over the CT images were loaded, one by one, in 
correspondent transversal planes in SolidWorks.  In Fig. 2 the primary curves of the femur and 
pelvis virtual bones were presented.

Using complex techniques for virtual modeling and automatic interpolation, the outer surface 
became more soft (Fig. 3, a). To generate the three-dimensional virtual intramedullary canal of the 
femur it has been used the same method used in defining the outer geometry. Thus, in the same 
planes used to define the basic geometry of the femur corresponding to the planes of tomography, 
has been designed the interior contours (the boundary of the intramedullary canal). In Fig. 3, b) are 
shown the drawn contours (in AutoCAD) then exported to SolidWorks to get outside geometry 
(Loft) and interior geometry: intramedullary canal (Cut-Loft).

Virtual Model of the Affected Hip Joint  
An important reason which leads to the prosthetic hip joint replacement is osteoarthritis. From a 
morphological perspective, this condition consists almost not only in the entirely femoral cartilage 
destruction, disappearance of the joint space, but also in reducing the femoral head bone with 5-6 
mm, measured on diameter. The current understanding of hip OA is based on clinical observations, 
experimental studies, and computational/analytical models.  Computational models are attractive 
since it is technically feasible to develop hip joint models for patients, which could substantially 
improve the diagnosis and treatment of osteoarthritic hips.  
Based on these anatomical and pathological observations, in the virtual model was removed an 
area of the femoral head on the right virtual femur, using a Cut-Revolve SolidWorks shape [11]. 
Fig. 5 illustrates, for comparison, an integer normal femur and a femur affected by osteoarthritis.

To obtain the affected virtual hip joint, it has been used the same virtual "tools" as for the normal 
(healthy) joint, in Fig. 6 were presented the final two models of virtual hip.

The models were exported to ANSYS - very modern and powerful software tool based on Finite 
Element Method [12]. In order to obtain the mesh structure of the finite elements (Fig.7), elements 
of type tetrahedron were used and the network of elements and nodes foe each components of the 
hip joint is presented in Table 1.

To develop a simulation of the hip joints behavior during walking we can use a digitalized 
evolution of the femur force vs time for a normal bodyweight of 800N.  The material characteristics 
considered in analysis are: for pelvic bone, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of trabecular bone 
are 70 MPa and 0.2, and for cortical bone are 17 GPa and 0.3, respectively. For femur bone, 
Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of trabecular and cortical bone were taken 500 MPa and 0.3, 
respectively, 18.6 GPa and 0.3 [10]. The material characteristics are  introduced in ANSYS 
software. The stress maps are obtained for both: normal and affected hip systems. The stress maps  
obtained for the affected hip are presented in Fig. 8.

Conclusions 
Primarily the study objectives are to obtain a virtual model as complete as possible of 
biomechanical system of human hip, allowing the study of real situations, accidental, clinical, 
pathological or surgical situations. Also, on similar models can be virtual tested any kind of 
prosthetic elements. In this study, the virtual hip  model is elaborated based on the hypothese that 
the femoral head has a spherical geometry. 
Analyzing the maximum stress values obtained over the entire biomechanical system or on 
components, we can conclude that: 
- for the situation of normal gait, joint stress distribution in components was different for the two 
situations (normal hip and affected hip) which implies a significant change in geometry and loads 
on components; 
- the maximum stress value was much higher in affected hip because the cartilage leads to greater 
contact stresses due to decreased contact area which is solicitated by the same loading force; 
- for the situation of the affected hip, a maximum stress value of 8.024 MPa, more higher than 
normal case (5.36 MPa) was obtained. 
Our future research work will continue in order to study normal and abnormal hips (like 
osteoarhritic hips) using an instrumented hip prosthesis during various activities of daily living: 
normal walking, fast walking, up stairs, down stairs, squat, standing up, sitting down.

Abstract. Polylactic acid (PLA) is a bioabsorbable polymer that is used in a variety of medical 
conditions. Complex forms of this material are commonly made for fixation and reconstruction of 
bone fractures. These bioabsorbable implants have been gaining popularity as an alternative to 
metal implants to stabilize small fractures due to its metal counterpart, avoiding problems such as 
bone resorption, additional surgery after fixation, infection and possible new fractures. In this  
paper are shows a number of finite element analysis that aims to determine the functionality of the 
plates and screws fixation with bioabsorbable material made from PDLLA copolymers 50/50 and 
85/15 PLLA -PGA respectively, for fixing and rebuilding of bone fractures in hand. 
1. Introduction 
The ideal management of unstable fractures or of complex hand injuries is controversial. There is 
talk of optimal functional outcome, when the anatomical reduction and stable fixation, which allows 
early mobilization, but minimizing damage and interference with soft tissues [1,2]. This stability is 
commonly provided with metallic materials; however these materials are not exempt of many 
complications, because they do not comply in full with the second requirement. The consolidation 
of fractures of metacarpals and phalanges is performed usually 4 to 7 weeks [3], after this, the 
osteosynthesis materials do not meet any function, and his prolonged stay in the body can cause 
side effects [4,5]. There have been reports of complications with the use of metallic fastening 
devices of up to 36 %. Among them the most common are: rigidity, osteopenia, prominence of the 
plate, pain, tendon rupture and bone infections. Furthermore, the presence of metallic material can 
interfere with radiological follow [1,6]. Since bioabsorbable materials are metabolized and 
eliminated by the body, the permanence of the foreign body and its potential adverse effects are 
avoide [7,8]. The use of bioabsorbable implants is proposed as an alternative to reduce many of 
these problems. Bioabsorbable fixation devices are currently used routinely in maxillofacial surgery, 
and preferred on the metallic material in many hospitals, mainly for growing skulls [9].  
Recent advances in the development of materials and manufacturing techniques have opened the 
possibility that they are also used in orthopedic surgery and hand. Although rigid fixation can 
facilitate early mobilization, it may cause over time decreased bone density, because the implant 
assumes all mechanical load, which is required to hold the bone metabolically active. Less rigid 
implants meanwhile, to allow micro movements during the consolidation process can lead to the 
formation of callus with better rates of union. The plates that are absorbed slowly transferred to 
bone stress gradually weakens preventing it .This transfer also decreases the secondary stress that 
normally exists at the ends of the plate and the screw holes after they are removed [1,10]. 
Currently, the main concern regarding the use of bioabsorbable material in hand surgery is 
whether it provides sufficient rigidity and strength to withstand the mechanical loads to which it is 
subjected during early mobilization. The rigidity that is achieved with these implants , although 
some studies have shown favorably , it is not completely equal to that of metallic implants[1]. In 
addition, biochemical decomposition of bioabsorbable material can lead to rapid loss of initial 
resistance, producing potentially high failure rates and refracture. However , the failure of the

implants in need of secondary reduction is not unique bio-absorbable material, it has reported a rate 
of loosening or breaking of plates and screws of titanium or stainless steel up to 8 % [11]. This 
paper proposes several trials finite element , using the ANSYS Workbench software allowing to 
determine the behavior of a plate of 7 orifices ( PDLLA 50/50 ) and anchor pins ( 85/15 PGA - 
PLLA ) as shown in Fig. 1.

2. Fractures of the metacarpals and phalanges in the hand 
Metacarpals and phalanges are long tubular bones and subcutaneous location makes them very 
vulnerable to injuries, especially in the workplace  
For treatment it is important to know a number of anatomical considerations: 
 There are two arcs in hand, cross one corresponds to the metacarpophalangeal joints and a 
longitudinal centered in the third radio. These two arches give cupped hand and promote 
prehension, the arches of the hand as shown in Fig 2. 
 
Fig. 2. Two transverse and single longitudinal arches of the hand. 
 
 The second and third metacarpal are fixed and strongly attached to wrist and do not tolerate 
deformities, while the first, fourth and fifth metacarpals are mobile. 
 The digital channels, in extension are substantially parallel, while in flexion converge 
towards the scaphoid tubercle, finger convergence as shown in Fig 3.  
 
Fig. 3. Finger convergence. 
 
The production mechanism can be after a direct trauma on bone component (bruising, crushing, 
penetrating) or indirect (for tensile stress, angulation, torsion, compression). 
After a fracture, a characteristic deformities occur: 
 Flexion of the distal fragment ,with a dorsal angulation, by flexors and interosseous, harder 
to take in the 2nd and 3rd metacarpal  
174
Current Solutions in Mechanical Engineering

 Bone rotation body ( cubital the 2nd and 3rd and 4th radial and 5th ) , by the action of 
interosseous muscles 
 Shortening of the fracture of the metacarpal or phalanx by the interosseous. 
 
In fractures of the hand, the rigid internal fixation is directed to the possibility of early 
mobilization to prevent joint contractures and tendon adhesions, which added morbidity. 
During early mobilization therapy, passive movements of the joints are made adjacent to the 
fracture site, and subsequently active movements controlled without resistance, until fracture 
healing is achieved between 4 and 7 weeks after the procedure. 
The basic movements of fine forceps, lateral pinch and palmar grip generate maximum forces of 
90 N / mm2 in women and 120 N / mm2 in men, which they should be offset by the mounting 
material used, until it happens bone healing. 
The incorporation of bioabsorbable material as fastening material in hand fractures has multiple 
theoretical advantages, as the ability to prevent adhesions, pain, osteopenia and reoperation for 
removal of material, it is essential to check its effectiveness, as a suitable carrier material in the 
surgical treatment of such diseases. 
3. Tests performed. 
The simulation environment tests are performed by applying forces 10 times higher than those 
occurring in a patient in recovery, which have maximum values of 2N equivalent to 200g, the value 
of these forces are obtained from an experimental basis presented in [3] and [4]; and pretending that 
the recovery phase is not carried in a good way and so see if a relatively extreme case, the material 
supports these charges. Such charges have 20N values equivalent to 2kg. 
For the tests, they were not taken into account some structures that are part of the system such as: 
tendons, muscle, skin, etc. they can become critical when supporting efforts and can somehow 
affect the results. 
3.1. Compression test  
The Fig. 4.a) shows a diagram of a right hand that you can see a fracture in the distal phalanx of the 
middle finger, you can see that there is a plaque that repairs the fracture and an arrow indicating the 
as applied the analysis force. The applied force is 20N facing the wrist, this experiment amounts to 
a resultant force to perform an action of everyday life as it is closing the hand or grab an object. In 
Fig. 4.b) the total strain that had the system with a maximum value of 0.13742 mm and effort 
voltage equivalent to 4.0378 MPa is shown in Fig. 4.c).

3.2. Bending test in the positive  axis 
For this test, the force is applied in a direction perpendicular to the phalanx of the middle phalanx 
articulation as shown in Fig. 5a), this force can occur when crack the fingers. For this test it shows 
that the material has a maximum displacement of 28.535mm and maximum equivalent stress of 
78.952 MPa voltage shown in Fig. 5b) and Fig. 5c) respectively.

3.3. Bending test on the  axis negative 
This test force is applied at the most critical possible place and is perpendicular to where the plate, 
having less resistance in this place fails possibilities are greater. An example of daily life where you 
can demonstrate this force is applied in a handshake. t is evident that the material has a maximum 
displacement of 39.329 mm and a maximum voltage stress of 32.356 equivalent MPa. In Fig. 6b)

The force is applied in the direction of the distal phalanx, such forces may be evidenced when the 
subject load a package. For this test is evidence that the material has a maximum displacement of 
12.418 mm and a maximum stress of 22.391 MPa equivalent stress, which supported the Fig. 7 a), 
Fig. 7 b) and Fig. 7 c), is clearly seen that the material does not support the applied force.

Conclusion 
Keep in mind that the material is not designed to take great efforts and which is a material that 
periodically rage degrading, implying that the material strength is inversely proportional to time, 
this also supports the immobilization of the fracture site to an advanced stage of recovery, that no 
effort that can generate a new fracture is present. It is concluded that the material is not designed to 
withstand tensile stresses, compression and bending as evidenced by the results of trials, it is a 
material used for attachment up to a passive member which will not apply considerable efforts.

Abstract. Car occupant protection in traffic accidents is a key target of today cars manufacturers. 
Known as active or passive safety, many technological solutions were developing over the time for 
an actual better car’s occupant safety. In the real world, in traffic accidents are often involved cars 
from different generations with various safety historical solutions. The aims of these papers are to 
quantify the influences over the car driver head loads in cases of different generation of cars 
involved in side crashes. For each case the experimental load results can be future used to calculate

Seven crash tests were performed. In each of them, except of last one, was used dummy as car 
driver in both in crash cars. Complex accelerometers were mounted for dummy’s head, chest, neck 
and pelvis. Accelerations, velocities and rotations of the cars were also measured. 
In the figures 3 – 8 on see a brief description of each crash together with head acceleration data.

Conclusions 
 
In the real world, crash tests are strong tools for improve both occupants and road vehicle 
safety. Compatibility between cars has for a long time been reduced to the simple image of heavy 
against light cars. Over the past years vehicle stiffness has been increased thanks to improved 
restraint systems. We also have a better understanding of the front end design energy absorption. 
Front end design is at the cross road of numerous contradictory constraints: self-protection of 
occupants, protection of vulnerable users such as pedestrians, reparability, styling, aerodynamics, 
engine cooling and so on. [4]. 
 
Using for each crash case cars with or without technical/age compatibility, we can write the 
followers main conclusions:

generation; The cars are dissimilar weights(Fiat Punto 55-895 kg, Chrysler PT Cruiser-1470 kg);

Abstract. The present underpins a computer-assisted investigation regarding the driver’s behavior 
and the injuries suffered in frontal vehicle collision, more precisely the injuries suffered in the 
thorax area. Hence, by means of the LS-Dyna software package we have carried out two series of 
virtual simulations with a dummy positioned on the driver’s place, i.e. belted and unbelted. For the 
simulation we have selected a Hybrid III 5th percentile female dummy. Aiming at achieving a 
simulation that would display a high accuracy degree with respect to the driver’s kinematic 
behaviour at the impact moment, our complete model also included, besides the dummy, the 
elements in the habitable: the seat, the seat belt, the steering wheel, the airbag and the dash board. 
Thus, the focus of the undertaken study was to establish the accelerations in the driver’s thorax area 
as well as the injury degree, expressed by the CSI (Chest Severity Index). The results obtained 
validated our hypothesis in that passive safety systems, i.e. the seat belt, diminish considerably the 
driver’s injuries degree in case of a road traffic accident. 
Introduction 
Traffic accidents represent one of the main causes for the total number of deaths recorded 
worldwide. Hence, the steadily increasing rate of traffic accidents casualties has led to the 
development of new inter- and cross-disciplinary research areas among which accidentology has 
been growing steadily both as an academic discipline as well as a professional area for which 
various new training programs have been set up and developed. As a relatively new research field, 
accidentology is concerned with the study of all processes occurred while driving a vehicle, not 
only during the accident, but also before and after the collision occurred. 
A prior research axis in road traffic accidents underpins the study of the kinematic behavior 
manifested by the vehicle’s occupants during the impact, as well as the risk assessment and the 
establishment of the injury degree in accordance with the occurring pattern of the accident 
analyzed. 
An overview of the main stream literature would pinpoint towards a series of comprehensive 
research studies within the above-mentioned field.  
Thus, [1] investigates the behavior of a ATD- type Hybrid III dummy, in case of a crash between 
a mid-size sedan and deformable and rigid poles. In this respect, various impact situations and 
different offsets have been considered, assessing at the same time the diver’s response at the impact 
moment by calculating the head injury criteria (HIC). 
Another landmark study in the field of accidentology is [2]. Appling the multibody dynamics 
method, the authors sought to investigate the dynamic response of driver’s behavior. The research 
has been set out based on the premises of a frontal accident. Thus, the driver’s head, chest and 
pelvic injuries were identified and recorded. In [3], the National Crash Analysis Center reveals a 
2009 Toyota Venza frontal crash against a rigid wall. The results obtained focused on the 
identification of injuries suffered by the occupant of the vehicle. A Hybrid III dummy type 50th 
percentile male was used to simulate the driver.

Statistical analysis elements in traffic accidents incidence 
By means of the undertaken research we sought to follow the influence of passive safety system 
– i.e. the safety seatbelt on the injuries and the driver’s behavior. 
In order to establish the type of the road user and to select the type of the passive safety system 
to analyze, we have designed the processing and the implementation of a statistical analysis 
regarding the number victims and the traffic accidents casuistry occurred between 2012- 2014 in the 
county Dolj. 
According the data provided by the Dolj County Police Traffic Department, over the last three 
years, there has been recorded an average of 800 accidents per year, of which around 260 accidents 
involved serious consequences. 
User type. With regard to the type of road users involved in road accidents, drivers have been 
registered as the highest rate of victims. Accordingly, throughout the period considered, the 
category of drivers registered over 1,100 deaths per year – Fig. 1. 
 
Fig.1. Types of road traffic users in 2012 – 2014 
Using passive safety systems. The steady improvement and development of passive safety 
systems combined with major vehicle manufacturers’ constant concern in protecting the vehicles 
occupants are aimed to minimize the serious consequences of traffic accidents. 
Aiming at analyzing the effectiveness of the above-mentioned safety systems, we have designed 
a comparative taking into consideration minor injuries and serious injuries, as well as deaths. 
During the time period investigated, we could register an increasing trend in the use of safety 
systems, by comparing it with the number of serious injuries. Thus, in 2012 we have registered 213 
cases of serious injuries to the occupants without safety systems, while in 2014 their number 
decreased to 200 cases – Fig. 2.

Virtual simulation of a frontal collision 
Our research study aimed at designing a virtual simulation of a frontal collision. Thus, by means 
of the software Virtual Crash we sought to establish both the vehicle’s motion curve throughout the 
pre-crash, crash and post-crash phases as well as to determine the kinematic parameters essential for 
the dynamic impact analysis. In this respect we have considered a mid-size sedan vehicle and a 
rigid wall while have set the PDoF, i.e. the main force direction, at a 12 o’clock position and a 
100% overlapping degree. Also, we set the vehicle’s initial velocity at 50 km/h -the velocity during 
the pre-crash phase. 
 
Fig.3. Virtual Crash frontal collision between a vehicle and a rigid wall  
 
As indicated by the velocity diagram versus time, we have registered the highest velocity 
variation during a time interim of 110 ms. Thus, in this interval the velocity rate extended from  a 0 
[mm/ms] point of departure reaching a maximum value (vmax) of 13,686 [mm/ms] at the final 
moment of tf=110 ms. 
Our computer-assisted simulation, carried out by means of Virtual Crash software, enabled us to 
establish the velocity time variation diagram. The results obtained have been then used to set out the 
proposed simulation using the LS-DYNA software package as shown in Fig. 4 below. 
 
Fig.4. Velocity variation curve in a running vehicle  
Determining the type and the driver’s positioning 
In order to obtain the virtual frontal collision modelling and the kinematic analysis of the driver’s 
behavior during the proposed frontal impact we resorted to a Hybrid III dummy 5th percentile 
female type. 
The set motion obtained following the various tests carried out throughout our research study 
was resulted from the speed variation resulting from the Virtual Crash software simulation. 
The Hybrid III 5th percentile female dummy was placed in a thorax-centered position versus the 
steering wheel, at a distance of 300 mm from the steering wheel. The position of the dummy we set 
the knee joint at a - 30˚ angle and both hands were placed on the wheel by bending the elbow joint 
at a -60˚ angle, as indicated in Fig. 5. Having set this positioning, we carried out two tests, one test

included the use of a restraint system – the three-point-fixed seatbelt and the second one without a 
seatbelt. 
 
Fig.5. Dummy positioning  
Aiming to analyze the influence of the frontal impact upon the driver we have designed a 
kinematic and dynamic model made of the dummy-seat-airbag system. In addition, for more 
accurate results, we have also included in the design of the model the following elements:  the dash 
board, the steering wheel and the steering column, as indicated in Fig. 6 below. It is worth 
mentioning, that these elements were introduced in model design in order to position the dummy as 
closely as possible to the real position of the driver. Furthermore, the introducing of these elements 
was motivated by the fact that at the impact moment, a number a series of injuries suffered by the 
driver occur due to his interaction with the elements inside the vehicle.

Results and discussion 
In order to establish the injury degree of the driver in the thorax area following a frontal car 
crush, we have considered the following parameters as well as the limits imposed by the regulations 
in force, i.e. FMVSS 208 [4]: 
 Acceleration: <60 g at CG  
 Chest severity index (CSI): 1000  
 
In this context, a standard injury measure may be applied to establish the deceleration profiles 
for both the head and the chest position of the driver in accordance with the undertaken crash 
simulations. Accordingly, the CSI (the chest severity index) is defined as [5]:

Following the frontal collision simulation of a vehicle against a rigid wall, at an initial velocity

If considering the situation in which the driver is anchored with the passive safety system, i.e. the 
three-point-fixed seatbelt, we have reached the conclusion that the maximum acceleration value (55 
g) is reached at the t=55 ms time moment. 
 
Fig.7. The acceleration value and the CSI – belted 
 
 
Both the maximum acceleration in the thorax area and the CSI value are below the maximum 
limits imposed by the FMVSS 208 regulations. 
 In this case, the degree of the injuries suffered by the driver in the chest area is compatible with 
survival. 
If the driver is not anchored with a passive safety system, the acceleration value and the CSI 
prove to be higher.

Conclusion 
In conclusion, based on the results obtained following the analysis of the above-mentioned 
situations, we can highlight that passive safety systems display a significant influence upon the 
driver’s injury degree during a frontal collision against a rigid wall at a speed of 50 km/h. The most 
severe injuries in the thorax area have been registered in such situations when the driver is not 
secured by a retention system, being thus not compliant with the limits imposed by the FMVSS 208 
crash regulations in force.

Abstract. Calculation of an intersection Level of Service (delay values in the intersection) is the 
basis for subsequent development of the area as well as testing factor for the optimum conditions of 
road traffic. However just as important in evaluating an intersection is the road priority direction. 
Bringing together the two necessities, in the current context of development, evaluation junctions 
also needs to be done based on delays caused by road direction priority and the possible problems it 
causes. A good road traffic requires a low delay value based on road direction priority. 
Introduction 
Capacity analysis at four-leg intersection with different types of priorities depends on a clear 
description and understanding of the interaction of drivers on the minor or stop-controlled approach 
with drivers on the major street.  
Level of service (LOS) for a four-leg intersection with different types of priorities is determined 
by the calculated or overall intersection measured control delay and is demarcated calculations for 
each minor movement [1, 2]. 
For the LOS calculation we first need to gather information’s about: 
• Geometric data 
• Hourly turning movement volumes 
• Heavy vehicle percentages 
• Pedestrian data 
• Upstream signal data 
The LOS conditions for four-leg intersection with different types of priorities are somewhat 
different from the criteria used for the evaluation in signalized intersections primarily because 
different transportation facilities create different driver perceptions and in some cases reactions. 
Important geometric factors include number and use of lanes, channelization, rank 2 movement 
from the major street or raised or striped median storage (or both), approach grade, and existence of 
flared approaches on the minor streets [3]. 
Priority of streams in for four-leg intersections 
In the calculation of LOS in intersections, the priority of right-of-way given to each traffic stream 
must be identified. Some streams have absolute priority, whereas others have to give way or yield to 
higher-order streams [1, 3]. 
Because of this in the case of four-leg intersections there are identified four ranks of priorities: 
• Movements of Rank 1 includes the priority movement of the major streets. 
• Movements of Rank 2 (subordinate to 1) include the traffic movements that will give way or 
stop to and only to Rank 1 movements (can be movements from the major streets and 
movements from the minor streets).

• Movements of Rank 3 (subordinate to 1 and 2) include the traffic only from the minor street 
and the movements will give way or stop to and only to Rank 1 and Rank 2 movements 
• Movements of Rank 4 (subordinate to all others) include the traffic only from the minor 
street and the movements will give way or stop to and only to Rank 1, Rank 2 and Rank 3 
movements. Rank 4 movements only occur at four-leg intersections. 
In a four-leg intersection we can identify 6 types of priority’s based on the conflict traffic 
movements in the intersections: 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 1 Four-leg intersection priority type 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 
 
For the facility of determining the rank of movements and the ease of calculations we assume 
that pedestrians crossing the subject or opposing approaches have Rank 1 status and that pedestrians 
crossing the two conflicting approaches have Rank 2 status. 
LOS calculation 
For the identification of the delay time in the intersection (LOS) we first need to calculate the 
following input data’s: 
• Critical Gap 
• Follow-Up Time 
• Conflicting flows 
• Potential capacity 
• Movement capacity 
• Queue lengths 
Critical gap and follow-up time. The critical gap is defined as the minimum time interval in the 
major-street traffic that allows intersection entry for one minor-street vehicle and respectively the 
time between the departure of one vehicle from the minor street and the time of the departure of the 
next vehicle using the same major-street gap is called the follow-up time [4, 5]. 
194
Current Solutions in Mechanical Engineering

Both the critical gap and follow-up time for all the 6 types of priorities and the result is given in a 
matrix type system based on the formulas given bellow: 
 
 
Fig. 2 Critical gap 
 
 
Fig. 3 Follow-up time 
Potential capacity. The potential capacity of a movement is defined as the capacity for a specific 
movement, assuming the following base conditions [5]: 
• Traffic from nearby intersections does not back up into the subject intersection. 
• A separate lane is provided for the exclusive use of each minor-street movement. 
• An upstream signal does not affect the arrival pattern of the major-street traffic. 
• No other movements of Rank 2, 3, or 4 impede the subject movement. 
To calculate this for all types of intersection we have to generate a priority matrix for the calculation 
of the conflicting flow rate based on the priorities and the geometrical format of the intersection:

Movement capacity. When traffic becomes congested in a high-priority movement, it can 
impede lower-priority movements from using gaps in the traffic stream, reducing the potential 
capacity of these movements. The ideal potential capacities must be adjusted to reflect the 
impedance effects of higher priority movements that may utilize some of the gaps sought by lower 
priority movements. This impedance may come due to both pedestrians and vehicular sources called 
movement capacity. 
The movement capacity is found by multiplying the potential capacity by an adjustment factor. This 
adjustment factor is calculated both for Rank 3 and Rank 4 movements [1-5]. 
Also if the priority movement is done on one or two lanes then an adjustment factor the Rank 2 
movement is also calculated. 
 
Fig. 5 Final movement capacity based on the geometrical configuration of the intersection 
 
The final movement capacity matrix takes into account the possibilities of the geometrical 
configuration of the intersection like: 
• The right-turning traffic from the major street is separated by a triangular island 
• The number of lanes one lane on the major street for every stream 
• The right-turn lane on the major street is separated from the rest of the movements 
• The minor approach is flared. 
• The access from the minor movements is done in two separate stages 
All the geometrical characteristics of the intersection are calculated in a matrix type formula:

LOS. The Level of Service the entire intersection is calculated in two steps: 
• Approach delay - control delay for any particular movement is a function of the capacity of 
the approach and the degree of saturation and is called approach delay [6] 
• Control delay – The control delay for all vehicles on a particular approach can be computed 
as the weighted average of the control delay estimates for each movement on the approach

Although the approach delay gives us an insight for the delay factor of every approach we need to 
calculate the LOS for the entire intersection [7]. 
The LOS for the entire intersection can be calculates using the same method as for the control 
delay, weighted average of the approach delays.

Conclusion 
The matrix type calculation of the LOS for every type of priority in a four-leg intersection is 
important in the evaluation of traffic based on the following: 
• We can juggle with the geometrical characteristics of the intersection (this are base 
conditions and were discussed in the chapter above) so we can maintain a lower delay for the 
intersection or approach priority desired 
• We can estimate in the same time what is the correct priority for an independent intersection 
with a fixed geometrical characteristics and flow volumes, based on the delay of the 
intersection or approach 
• We can analyze the traffic flow and the delay for multiple intersection in a zone based on 
different scenarios for upstream intersection priority

Introduction 
The VZN shock absorber concept granted with European Patents EP 1190184 [2], EP 
2078168/2011 [6] is characterized by damping coefficients self according with road and load 
conditions. 
The simulations made on vehicles equipped with new VZN shock absorbers concept relative to 
standard one, indicates better behavior concerning stability, comfort and reduced dissipated energy, 
with fuel consumption and pollution reducing effect. 
Starting on these remarks the paper evaluates the influence of the damping characteristic in 
suspension performances and dissipated energy, based a simulation on a Californian road realized 
with Matlab Simulink software. 
On the VZN Shock Absorber Concept 
 
Fig. 1 The VZN principle 
   The energy dissipation system of the self-adjustable 
shock absorber consists of an inner cylinder having 
sideways damping valves, placed optimally between to the 
ends. The inner cylinder is closed at ends with inner head 
and valve body, either containing or no filling valves. The 
piston slidably mounted within the inner cylinder, without 
filling and damping valves. 
   Due to this structure the shock absorber assures on both 
rebound respectively compression strokes small damping 
coefficients at the beginnings of strokes due to the fact that 
the liquid is discharged through a high number of damping 
valves, medium damping coefficients at the medium 
position due to the fact that the liquid is discharged through 
a medium number of damping valves, while when the 
piston approaches by strokes ends the damping coefficients 
increase due to the reduction of the active damping valves 
numbers. 
   Fig. 1 show on left side function on compression and on 
the right side function on rebound. FC and FR represent the 
damping forces on compression and rebound. 
   The solution was presented abroad first time in [1] 
On Previous Simulations Results 
Since year 2006 simulations on model ¼ cars demonstrates the VZN damper concept give 
skyhook behavior [3], decrease squat, vertical acceleration, the number and intensity of stopper 
bumper collision, the adherence, increasing thus the vehicle stability, comfort and reliability.

Tests on models ½ car, show the VZN concept increases stability at pitch and roll and confirm the 
previous results obtained on ¼ models [4], [5]. 
The current work completed previous research with one demonstrating other VZN qualities e.g. 
its capacity to manage damping coefficient, no more and no less, assuring high performances and 
thus reducing the dissipated energy, with favorable effect for reducing fuel consumption and 
pollution. 
Car/Road Vertical Interaction Model 
The quarter car model, used to study the vertical interaction between car vehicle and road is 
shown in Fig. 2. The numerical simulation in this section concerns only the vertical interaction for a 
rear wheel, neglecting the rolling and the pitch motion of the car. The model has 2 degrees of 
freedom, i.e., the vertical displacement x1 of the car body (bounce) and the vertical displacement x2 
of the wheel center (wheel hop). At time t, the vertical profile of the road is denoted by x0(t). The 
model contains two levels of elastic and damping elements: one level between the wheel and the 
road, characterized by the stiffness coefficient k2 of the tire and its damping coefficient c2; the 
second level between the wheel and the body (vehicle suspension), including a spring with stiffness 
coefficient k1 and a VZN shock absorber (or a standard shock absorber, as comparison variant) with 
damping coefficient c1. 
     
    m2 is the mass of one wheel (unsprung mass) and m1 
is the  reduced mass of the car body  (sprung mass), 
corresponding to  one rear wheel 
 
     m1empty denotes the reduced  mass of the car body for 
the  case of an unloaded car  (including only the mass 
for -driver and fuel) 
 
    m1full denotes the reduced  mass of the car body for 
the case of maximum admissible car loading.

In (1) Fe, stop bumper represents the elastic striking force when the piston hits either the rebound 
bumper (Fe, rebound bumper < 0 case) or the compression bumper (Fe, compression bumper > 0 case). As shown 
in Fig. 3, Fe, stop bumper increases linearly from 0 to -500 daN beginning at the touch point of rebound 
bumper, up to the d1 distance (stroke of the rebound bumper stop, under-500 daN ), respectively 
decreases linearly from 0 to 1000 daN beginning at the touch point of the compression bumper, up 
to d2 distance (stroke of the compression bumper stop). Otherwise, Fe, stop bumper is null.

VZN shock absorber has been compared with the case of using a standard shock absorber (i.e., the

• For the VZN shock absorber, the damping coefficient values increase on rebound stroke from

600000 [N.s/m], i.e. more than 3000 times between minimal and maximal values, depending of the 
instantaneous piston position. The evolution laws stroke-damping coefficient c1 (on rebound and 
compression strokes) is so far confidential. 
• For a standard shock absorber of the considered car, the damping coefficient c1 is given in     
Table 1. For different piston velocities vpiston, different values of c1 are given. The variation of c1  
with respect to vpiston is linear between the discrete points given in the table.

Results Evaluations 
On Californian road the VZN shock absorber has next results comparative to the standard one. 
• At dispersion “σ “of car body vertical displacement  
∆VZN/S =  
    11    % 
• At car body squat “δ”

∆VZN/S = 
–  37    % 
• On dissipated energy “E” 
 
 
 
 
∆VZN/S = 
–  28.4 % 
According previous results, the VZN progressive damper concept gives better behavior 
comparative to standard one thus: 
Applied Mechanics and Materials Vol. 823

• 6% at car body squat, better maintaining the vehicle body-road clearance, reducing the risk 
of under body collision 
• 37 % for RMS acceleration, increasing the comfort 
• 28.4 % for dissipated energy, reducing the rolling resistance and thus the fuel consumption 
and pollution. 
VZN is lower on this regime with 11% at vertical body displacement dispersion due to softer 
reaction for important comfort advantage. 
Abbreviations/symbols and units list 
In the paper were utilized next abbreviations, symbols and units: 
E [J]      – the energy dissipated by the shock absorber 
VZN      – the abbreviation for the shock absorber with progressive damping characteristic 
S 
 – the abbreviation for the standard shock absorber 
σ [m]     – body vertical displacement dispersion  
δ [m]     – body squat, evaluated with the difference between static vertical position and dynamic  
 
     vertical position evaluated by RMS body vertical position 
a [m/s2] – body vertical RMS acceleration 
Conclusions 
The VZN damping coefficients accorded with the vehicles load and with road unevenness confer 
a soft response at low excitation and strong reactions at high excitations, dissipating energy function 
of the needs, no more, no less, assuring thus comfort at small and medium excitation, increasing 
body stability, eliminating or reducing the number and the intensity of stopper bumper collision 
protecting the axles and body and reducing the dissipated energy and so decreasing the fuel 
consumption and pollution. 
Results and patented solutions are guaranties for VZN concept successfully applicability.

Introduction 
The paper presents a complex quarter car model obtained with ADAMS software, View module, 
useful in the first stage of suspension dimensioning and optimization. Even at this stage can not 
overlook the fact that suspension stroke has lower values than the free oscillation amplitude, 
especially in the natural frequency of the body and axles/semi-axles, so the models must to have 
stroke limiters. Because the stroke limitation, must be softly, to not harm passenger safety and 
comfort and reliability of vehicle body and axles, the model is achieved by elastic stopper bumpers 
on both rebound and compression strokes. 
The same, the model is equipped with trim corrector acting like a supplementary suspension 
spring, adding on the main suspension spring. 
The proposed quarter car model with two degrees of freedom (wheel and body) performs all 
these goals allowing changing: 
• 
Geometrical elements 
• 
Position of equilibrium, depending on vehicle load; 
• 
Trim correction; 
• 
Elastic and dissipative characteristics of the suspension and tire; 
• 
Suspension stroke; 
• 
Road profile, assessed either by simple or summation of harmonic functions or reproducing 
real roads 
• 
Buffers (for stroke limitation) position and characteristics; 
The models developed provide information on: 
• 
Vertical stability assessed by vertical movements of the body and the longitudinal and 
transversal stability evaluated based on adherence characterized by wheel ground contact 
force and frequency of soil detachment wheel. 
• 
Comfort assessed on the basis of body vertical acceleration and collision forces to the stroke 
ends. 
• 
The body-road clearance 
• 
The trim corrector efficiency 
• 
All above performances evaluated function the road unevenness, acceleration, deceleration, 
turning regime. 
The Quarter Car Model Realized in Adams-View Module 
The quarter car model realized with ADAMS, module View is presented in the Figure 1. 
The damping characteristic is defined by damping forces at different speed for each strokes 
respectively one for rebound and other for compression. 
The contact force road-wheel (CONTACT_1) is defined based on the tire rigidity. 
The stopper buffer forces on compression (CONTACT_2) and rebound (CONTACT_3) are 
defined based on the each specific rigidity characteristics. 
The road excitation is realized with a function generator.

The Trim Corrector Principle and the Correction Tested 
 
The suspension trim corrector consist of an element adding to the suspension main spring a 
supplementary ascendant force in order to adjust properly the body-ground clearance, respectively 
the equilibrium position relative to the stopper stroke buffers to avoid their violent collision. 
 
The supplementary buoyant force is realised with a pneumatic element mounted on the shock 
absorber or parallel with this and has the task to create a force which compensate the force of the 
main spring losses when it lengthen. The calculus relations are:

Abstract. On-board malfunction simulation consists of generating controlled malfunctions by 
transmitting, through sensor connector, a signal of a certain variation/ wave to the electronic control 
unit. Thus, the control unit will interpret that the monitored system has  a malfunction. The main 
advantage of this method is that it allows the simulation for a wide range of malfunctions without 
requiring complex operations when changing from one type of malfunction to another. Also, this 
method (nondestructive type) exploits the technical potential of on-board diagnosis systems which 
fit modern vehicles and it allows to use the same devices for all types of simulated malfunctions.  
Introduction 
In automotive industry, the implementation process of a diagnosis system involves a previous 
stage which is represented by testing. Usually this is done in controlled lab conditions onto the 
designed system. Throughout this stage, the diagnosis system’s stability is being verified compared 
to the malfunctions that may occur during normal functioning of the monitored system. The main 
objectives are: [3] 
- detecting a maximum array of malfunctions typology; 
- the isolation degree for the signaled malfunctions: determine where in the system the malfunction 
is located meaning what component has malfunctioned; 
- reduce the number of false alarms meaning that the system indicates a certain malfunction but in 
reality the system has none what so ever; 
- reduce the number of missed detections, meaning that the system has a certain flaw but this is not 
signaled by the diagnosis system.  
If the results do not correspond, it is necessary to redefine the diagnosis system’s requirements. 
Thus, various simulation procedures for certain malfunctions may be also useful for: 
- experimental validation of new algorithms or newly issued diagnosis procedures, following in the 
same time the same objectives as the case of testing the diagnosis system; 
- during personnel training sessions another objective is being tracked that of perfecting skills in 
what concerns detecting malefactions that are located at various levels or at different parts that 
makes up the vehicle.  
The used procedure when testing a diagnosis system is about generating a controlled malfunction 
at the level of certain parts that are components of the vehicle and tracking how the system reacts 
when these flaws are simulated.  
On-board malfunction simulation 
As previously mentioned throughout this paper, within the electronically controlled systems, 
parts are being monitored with the help of sensors. Thus, when a flaw is of mechanical nature it

leads to part parameters that step outside their normal operation values, values that are monitored by 
sensors. In this situation, as well as malfunctions that are located at sensory levels, they will 
transmit to the electronic control unit (ECUengine) information that does not correspond to normal 
operation conditions of the monitored parts.  
Fig. 1. Connecting the signal generator 
in order to simulate malfunction 
located at the engine level: 
 
1 – sensor connector; 
2 – pair sensor connector; 
3 – pair ECUengine  connector; 
4 – signal generator connector; 
5 – sensor; 
6 – ECUengine; 
7 – signal generator. 
In this context, a modern method that malfunctions may be simulated at part level (here 
including those mechatronic parts) is substituting the signal which is transmitted by sensors to the 
electronic control units. 
According to this scheme, to the pair connection plug of the analyzed sensor, a signal generator 
is being connected (Fig. 1) which will relay towards the electronic control unit a voltage. Its 
variation corresponds to the type of malfunction it is being wished to simulate. Thus the control unit 
will interpret that the signal that it is receiving comes from the analyzed sensor and it is being 
determined by the existence of a malfunction at the level of the part that it is being monitored by 
that sensor. 
 
Fig. 2. Linear signal generator scheme  
(R1÷3 – resistances, P1,2 – potentiometer, D1,2 – diode) 
Fig. 2 presents an electric scheme of a signal generator, here also mentioning its components. 
The generator is supplied by a 6V voltage and has two exits:  
- Out 1, on which the generated voltage may be tuned at a value between 0 and 1,2V, useful to 
simulate malfunctions on sensors that have their output voltage below 1V; 
- Out 2 on which the generated voltage may be between 0 and 6V, useful to simulate malfunctions 
on sensors that have their output voltage between 1 and 5V.  
Experimental test instrumentation 
For exemplification we will further present a simulation methodology of malfunctions that may 
occur at air absolute pressure sensor located in the intake manifold for a spark ignition engine (Fig.

3). Experimental tests were carried out on a K4M engine that has the following characteristics: fuel 
feeding system – gasoline injection; number of cylinders – 4 in line; cylindrical capacity – 1598 
cm3; nominal output power – 82 kW (110bHP) at 6000 rev/min; maximum torque 145 Nm at 4250 
rev/min; pollution norm – Euro3. 
During experimental tests the following equipment was used:  
- Renault Clip V10.2 diagnosis application, in order to monitor and record parameters that 
characterize engine operation; 
- exhaust gas analyzer SUN MGA 1500, in order to determine engine’s polluting emissions; 
- arbitrary function generator, in order to simulate malfunctions. 
     
 
Fig. 3. The absolute air pressure sensor [1, 4] within the intake manifold and their instrumentation 
during the experimental test runs: A – full load; B – idling; 1 – vacuum pipe; 
2 – piezoelectric diaphragm; 3 – sensor cables; 4 – reference chamber 
A common malfunction of the absolute air pressure sensor within the intake manifold is the loss 
of vacuum chamber tightness, caused by: [2] 
- vacuum pipe cracking; 
- physical damage of piezoelectric diaphragm (for example due to aging of the material). 
Improper working of the absolute air pressure sensor may be resulted by modifications in time of 
the physical properties of the piezoelectric diaphragm (damaging the sensitive element). 
Another category of malfunctions, may occur in the circuit connection, as follows: [2] 
- open circuit in the piezoelectical diaphragm conections; 
- open circuit at the level of the sensor connections with ECUengine; 
- imperfect electrical contacts at the level of the sensor connections or at ECUengine conections; 
- malfunctions in the wiring between the sensor and ECUengine (insulating layer damaged, short 
circuit between conectors or short to ground). 
To cover all these types of malfunctions were performed 6 experimental tests: one non-fault (P0 
– normal operation of the engine) and 5 tests (P1÷P5) the engine operation in the presence of 
simulated malfunctions, the results are presented in Fig. 4÷13 and Table 1. 
The time taken to perform each test was 10s and it involved accelerating the engine from its idle 
speed (690 rev/min) to the speed of 2500 rev/min. During the experimental test runs the following 
parameters were monitored: engine speed, absolute pressure inside the intake manifold, the 
throttle’s position, gas pedal position, estimated air flow through the intake manifold, instantaneous 
fuel consumption and concentration of pollutant emissions from engine exhaust gases (unburned 
hydrocarbons – HC and carbon monoxide – CO, the main pollutants emitted by spark ignition 
engines, such as the one prepared in this paper). 
The 6 experimental tests are: 
- P0 test run – engine normal operation without any malfunctions. 
- P1 test run – simulation of a short circuit in the sensor cables (short-circuit to ground or between 
conductors). 
- P2 test run – simulation of an interruption of power/mass sensor circuit. 
Applied Mechanics and Materials Vol. 823

- P3 test run – simulating a constant output voltage for the sensor, equal to 2,40 V that corresponds 
to 555 mbar value of the absolute pressure inside the intake manifold. This type of malfunction may 
be resulted when the piezoelectric diaphragm of the sensor is fissured or cracked or by 
modifications that may occur in time to the physical properties of the piezoelectric diaphragm 
(modifications that may determine the lack of response or increased inertia of the sensor compared 
to variations within the intake manifold). 
- P4 test run – simulating a constant output voltage for the sensor, equal to 3,60 V that corresponds 
to 785 mbar value of the absolute pressure inside the intake manifold. This type of malfunction can 
be determined from the same causes as the simulated malfunction of P3 test. 
- P4 test run – simulating an output voltage that has rectangular oscillations at a frequency of 0,3Hz 
between 1,6-3,1 V. In order to achieve that type of shape for the output signal, the following 
settings for the arbitrary function generator will be operated: frequency – 0,3 Hz, amplitude – 0,7 V, 
offset – 1,5 V. This type of malfunction may be caused by fissures propagated through the 
piezoelectric diaphragm of the sensor (or compromising the vacuum chamber seal) or by the 
existence of some imperfect electrical contacts at the level of the sensor connections or at its` 
components. 
Experimental results 
Wrong signals which are transmitted by absolute air pressure sensor to  ECUengine cause a 
maladjustment of injected fuel flow different by real engine operating requirements. Thus, during 
the experimental tests were found the following effects of simulated malfunctions: 
- increase of fuel consumption (tab.2); 
- increase of pollutant emissions from engine exhaust gases (tab.1); 
- engine speed fluctuations at idling (P1, P2 tests); 
- unevenly function of engine at partially load (P4 test); 
- engine stops during acceleration (test P3 – at time 2,547 s from the start of the records); 
- engine stops during idling (test P5 – at time 4,906 s from the start of the records).

Conclusions 
On-board malfunction simulations consists of generating controlled malfunctions by substituting 
working signals (input voltages, output voltages) of mechatronic components (sensors, actuators). 
Inadequate technical condition of the absolute air pressure sensor within the intake manifold can 
have different effects on engine operation: 
- minor effects (increase of fuel consumption or of pollutant emissions from engine exhaust gases), 
although they change the values of a characteristic parameters, the engine remains still functional; 
- critical effects (unevenly function of engine at partially load or engine speed fluctuations at idling 
due to the existence of a mixture excessively rich or poor), affecting the proper functioning of the 
engine in a noticeably way; 
- effects as crashes, which causes the engine to stop functioning or impossibility of its start.

Abstract- The intent of this paper is to present a multi-domain and structural study of a hydraulic 
hybrid machine. The evaluation of different solutions is based on simulation approach, using LMS 
Imagine.Lab (Amesim) and Ansys Workbench software packages. Amesim provides a 1D 
simulation suite to model and analyze multi-domain intelligent systems, to predict their multi-
disciplinary performance and Ansys Workbench Durability tool performs the high cycle fatigue life 
calculation. The multi-domain analyses are made for different constructive solutions at different 
drive ratio. The comprehensive fatigue calculations and results enable engineers to evaluate the 
main shaft design of the hydraulic motor in order to avoid failures under real world conditions. 
Some recommendations are made regarding possible solutions. 
Introduction 
The drastic reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions and the usage of conventional fossil fuels 
has become an important goal for all major car producers. A number of technical solutions with 
radical changes in propulsion systems have been developed and an alternative means of transport; a 
good solution to solve the problems of environmental pollution is the hydraulic hybrid vehicle 
(HHV). 
Hydraulic alternant propulsion system [1] use pressurized hydraulic fluid to drive hydraulic 
machinery and consists of three parts: a generator (e.g. a hydraulic pump, driven by an electric 
motor or a combustion engine), a piping assembly (with valves and filters) to guide/control the flow 
and the motor to drive the vehicle. 
A translational movement induced in a liquid trapped in a pipe is propagated through the liquid to the 
other end of the pipe where a piston transforms the wave energy in a translational mechanical movement 
that can be used both for a linear or rotational actuator, the hydraulic alternant motor. 
The mathematical model of the hydraulic alternant propulsion motor is based on the sonic theory 
developed by Gogu Constantinescu [2]. It’s main equation of the output power (Eq. 1) is given by:

N is the number of phases, S the flow through the apertures, the perditance of the apertures and 
H the pressure amplitude in the rotor. 
The simulations are separated in two different parts, a multi-domain and a structural analysis. 
First is a 1D multi-domain simulation where the objectives are to design, pre dimension and test 
several variants for a hydraulic hybrid machines, to identify how design parameters affect the 
operation of the proposed systems and to extract the pressure from the generator pistons. Second 
simulation, is a 3D durability computation where the pressure from the pistons obtained with the 
help of 1D software is used as load to perform a fatigue calculation for a hydraulic motor main shaft 
in order to evaluate the proposed design.

The Model of the Hydraulic Vehicle in LMS Imagine.Lab 
LMS Imagine.Lab software [3] enables connection of several components working after various 
physical principles to capture the functioning of the mechanical joint and hydraulic drive systems. 
The making of the hydraulic hybrid simulation model involved the use of components from hydraulic 
and mechanical libraries of the software. 
The principle of the proposed system [4, 5] is illustrated in Fig. 1. An internal combustion engine 
(replaced in analysis by a signal generator), drives a hydraulic piston system and converts the 
mechanical energy into hydraulic energy. This hydraulic energy is transported through a pipeline 
system to another hydraulic piston, converted into rotational mechanical energy resulting a torque 
into the drive wheels of the vehicle. The significance of the symbols associated with the model are 
summarized in Table 1.

For determine the dynamic behavior under hydraulic propulsion system more multi-domain 
models were analyzed. The final virtual investigations were made by using linear vs. progressive 
engine speed, with three different gearbox ratio variations: 1:9.055 (1st shift gear), 1:5.259(2nd shift 
gear) and 1:3.318 (3th shift gear). 
The investigation on Linear Engine Speed vs. Progressive Engine Speed show that using 
Progressive Engine Speed, leads to possibility to increase the working frequency for hydraulic 
circuit. 
Comparing the torque (Fig. 2) starting from the generator (input) combustion engine till to the 
drive wheels of the vehicle (output) we can observe how the torque values increase and multiply 
several times his values during the functionality of the system,. The torque is plotted for the three 
different gearbox ratio, with red is plotted 1st, green 2nd and blue the 3th shift gear.

Durability analysis of the hydraulic motor main shaft 
FEA based fatigue design. Fatigue analysis procedures for the design of highly developed 
structures recline on techniques, which have been developed many years ago. Initially these 
techniques were relatively simple procedures. These techniques have become progressively more 
sophisticated with the introduction of strain based techniques to deal with local plasticity effects. 
Last techniques have been introduced to address with the occurrence of stresses in more than one 
principal direction (multi-axial fatigue) and to deal with vibrating structures where responses are 
predicted as PSDs (Power Spectral Densities) of stress. 
Today, 95% of all fatigue design calculations are covered by one of three approaches, Stress-
Life, Strain-Life or Crack-Propagation [6]. With the introduction of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) 
techniques, has come the possibility of doing fatigue calculations long before a prototype exists.  
Fig. 5 gives an overview of the FEA based fatigue environment. The three plots on the left 
indicate the FEA results, applied loading and materials information. The three plots on the right 
show the types of result visualization that are possible. The center box indicates the types of fatigue 
calculations that can be done.  
Strain-Life fatigue design calculation. Stress Life is based on empirical S-N curves and then 
modified by a variety of factors [7]. Strain Life is based upon the strain life relation equation where 
the strain life parameters are values for a particular material that best fit the equation to measured 
results. The strain-life relation equation is shown below, Eq. 2. The two cyclic stress-strain 
parameters are part of the Eq. 3.

The terms durability, reliability and fatigue are often loosely used in the same analysis situation. 
The term durability is often used as a term describing the overall life requirement. The term 
reliability usually also includes a reference to a probability of failure, such as to have a 95% 
likelihood of survival. The term fatigue is usually used to describe the process by which cracks 
form and grow within materials when subjected to fluctuating stresses and strains. 
FE model building and post-processing issues. In general, there are three phases in any 
computer-aided engineering task: Pre-processing is defining the finite element model and 
environmental factors to be applied to it. Analysis solver is solution of finite element model. Post-
processing refers to the interpretation of results using various visualization tools.  
CAD model (step format) of the main shaft was imported in ANSYS WORKBENCH 15.0. Mesh 
generation is the practice of generating a polygonal or polyhedral mesh that approximates a 
geometric domain.   
The FE model is presented in Fig. 7. The model is supported by two cylindrical bearings. The 
rollers act on the cam with a normal pressure of 139.3 [MPa], corresponding to a working pressure 
of 220 bars.  
The shaft is fixed at one end. Environmental loading conditions are shown in Fig. 8.

The maximum principal stress is 255.15 [MPa]. The stress smooth contours, the maximum value 
and the locations are presented in Fig. 9 and in Fig. 10.

Durability analysis. Fatigue calculations using the strain-life approach is performed on the main 
shaft. A design life of 1e8 cycles is considered. Through the functionality mode of the hydraulic 
device, a rotation of the shaft generates three cycles of zero - based pulsed load. Fatigue material 
property tests are usually conducted under very specific and controlled conditions. If the service 
part conditions differ from the as tested conditions, modification factors can be applied to try to 
account for the difference. Fatigue Strength Factor Kf reduces the fatigue strength and must be less 
than one. Loading Scale Factor LSF will scale all stresses, to avoid having to solve the FE model 
again. Fatigue strength factor Kf = 0.7 and LSF =1.1. The mean stress correction is realized using 
Smith, Watson and Topper (SWT) method.  
Fatigue Life is estimated over the whole model of the shaft. This result contour plot shows the 
available life for the given fatigue analysis. If loading is of constant amplitude, this represents the 
number of cycles until the part will fail due to fatigue. If loading is non-constant, this represents the 
number of loading blocks until failure. The minimum estimated life is 2.2742e7 cycles. 
Fig. 11. Estimated life isolines 
Fig. 12. Minimum estimated life value 
Fatigue Sensitivity shows how the fatigue results change as a function of the loading at the 
critical location on the model. An increase with 50% of the pulsed load leads to an estimated life 
equal with 1.5233e6 cycles (14.6 times less), Fig. 13.  
Hysteresis. In a strain-life fatigue analysis, although the finite element response may be linear, 
the local elastic/plastic response may not be linear. The Neuber correction is used to determine the 
local elastic/plastic response. Repeated loading will form closed hysteresis loops as a result. In a 
constant amplitude analysis a single hysteresis loop is created, Fig. 14.

Conclusion: 
The current paper presents a brief study on the influence of some parameters on a hydraulic 
hybrid machines and performs a high cycle fatigue life calculation for a generator main shaft. 
After several analyses we observe that the Generator and Motor design, allow us to use a higher 
diameter of the pistons; a diameter of 20 mm was implemented. Also, using a lower final drive 
ratio, the resistive torque will increase, and the system will not be able to react on this situation. 
Therefore, is recommended to use a larger time for starting the system. 
The structural analysis results shows that the minimum estimated life is 2.2742e7 cycles for 
fatigue life and 1.5233e6 cycles for fatigue sensitivity.

Abstract. The paper presents two kinematic schemes of the reverse driving mechanism on CVT's, 
the first one for rear-wheel, and the second one for front-wheel drive. For the first kinematic 
scheme, the reverse driving mechanism consists of a planetary cylindrical gear set and a multi-disk 
brake. In order to achieve a better efficiency for reverse driving, we propose a new kinematic 
structure of a planetary cylindrical gear mechanism, simpler than the existing designs. While 
describing a synthesis of the new kinematic solution, special attention was granted to maintaining 
the advantages of each of the two existing mechanisms, and highlighting the advantage for using 
less cylindrical gears. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
As compared to step variable transmission [1, 2], the continuously variable transmission (CVT) 
has a series of both operational and economic advantages such as: 
• an infinite number of gear ratios; 
• better behavior during operation (adjusting and changing the load); 
• better safety and acoustics during operation. 
Classical CVT's are designed to use rubber V-belts or metal V-chains. The wide interest in CVT 
is determined by optimization possibilities with regard to fuel consumption, exhaust emissions, 
traction power, costs and comfort. CVT's equipped with a metal V-chain of type VIP type (Positive 
Infinitely Variation) have been in use ever since 1960 on BMW automobiles, but the system did not 
become popular due to its costly technique [3, 4].  
Fiat motor vehicles have been equipped with Van Doorne transmission (metal pushing V-belt [2, 
5]). In the last 20 years we have encountered an increase in the use of CVT's with belts for cars  
with a small and medium cylinder capacity provided with front-wheel drive [1, 6]. 
 
 
Continuously Variable Transmissions 
 
If we compare metal trapezoidal V-belts with metal V-chains, the metal pushing V-belt (fig. 1, 2) 
has a series of advantages [3]. 
The main advantages of the metal push belt CVT [5, 7] are: 
• flexible and wider selection  of gear ratios; 
• optimization of the engine torque according to the car road resistance; 
• simplified command and control; 
• increased comfort during operation; 
• small weight and reduced complexity. 
The metal pushing V-belt CVT [1] consists of a variable pulley transmission, a torque converter 
(hydrodynamic or magnetic powder clutch), a planetary cylindrical gear mechanism or a spur gear

Types of metal belt CVT 
 
Let us consider a metal V-belt CVT type Van Doorne type [3, 5] used for rear-wheel drive, 
where the main assembly is the metal V-belt transmission (fig. 3).

• a torque converter (1); 
• a clutch for coupling the driving shaft with the turbine (2); 
• a radial piston pump (3);

• a planetary cylindrical gear mechanism for forward/reverse driving (4); 
• a multi-disk brake for reverse driving (5); 
• a multi-disk clutch for forward driving (6); 
• a driving pulley (7); 
• a metal pushing V-belt (8);  
• a driven pulley (9); 
• a serial cylindrical gear transmission (10); 
• a driven shaft with flanges (11). 
The two pulleys have a hydraulically driven disk each, and the hydrostatic pressure being for 
pulling the metal V-belt. 
By means of the hydraulic pressure of one the driving pulley disks (7), the circular trajectory of 
the metal V-belt changes gradually, which determines a change of the pulley transmission ratio. 
Prior to the pulley transmission there is the planetary cylindrical gear mechanism, equipped with 
a multi-disk clutch (for forward driving) and with a multi-disk break (for reserve driving). 
After the pulley transmission there is a cylindrical gear transmission with two spur gears, which 
adapts the pulley transmission to the final transmission. 
Thus, for rear-wheel drive it is possible to ensure alignment of the input and output shafts (fig. 
3), and for front-wheel drive it is possible to ensure the necessary distance from the design point of 
view (fig. 4). 
Fig. 4 Kinematic scheme of a metal pushing V-belt CVT for front driving axle 
 
This CVT performs the forward and reverse driving by means of a series of spur gears, 
controlled by a synchronizing coupling (fig. 4). 
At the entering of the CVT, there is an electromagnetic clutch Aem (fig. 4) which drives the 
tubular shaft connected with the gear 1, which is permanently connected to the gear-set 2-2'. 
The collar m rotates together with the driven tubular shaft on which the conical disk D1s is fixed.  
For forward driving (D), the collar m moves to the left until it couples with gear 1. 
Applied Mechanics and Materials Vol. 823
225

For the neutral position, the collar m is on the median position when it does not couple with any 
of gears 1 and 3 (as it is in figure 4). 
For reverse driving (R), the collar m moves to the right until it couples with the gear 3.  
In the last situation, the rotation motion is transmitted from the clutch to the shaft of the conical 
disk to the left D1s through the kinematic chain formed by the cylindrical gears (1,2),(2',4) and (4,3). 
The position of the second driving disk (to the right D1d) is automatically adjusted by the oil 
pressure. The metal V-belt Cm is located between the conical surfaces of the disks D1s and D1d, and 
the contact radius is proportional to the engine rpm. 
The conical disks D2s and D2d are mounted on the driven shaft of the metal belt transmission (fig. 
4), and the left disk D2s can move axially at the same time and to the same direction as the disk D2d. 
The driven shaft of the CVT transmits the rotation motion to the conical differential Dc on the 
drive axle through the cylindrical gears (5, 6) and (6', 7). 
This type of CVT (fig. 4) delivers transmission ratios of 2.5 - 0.5. Transmission is designed for 
cars organized according to the solution "all in front", with the thermal engine mounted 
transversally, having a small capacity (500 - 1000 cm3) and a maximum torque of 80 Nm. 
The advantage of such a continuous variable transmission lies in the possibility to obtain an 
infinite number of gear ratios, in a wide range, using a simple hydraulic control and command 
system, with the following characteristics: 
• the possibility to reach the necessary power instantaneously; 
• silent operation, which increases the comfort when driving the car; 
• control of the "motor brake"; 
• optimizing the ratio power / rpm of the thermal engine, depending on the variation of 
resistance confronted by the vehicle, thus optimizing the fuel consumption.   
 
Reverse Driving Mechanisms 
 
Reverse driving mechanisms are located between the converter and the  pulley transmission (fig. 
3 and 4). The structure of these mechanisms is characterized by the presence of spur gears (fig. 4) or 
of planetary cylindrical gears (fig. 3). 
There are three operation phases of such a mechanism: a neutral phase when these are two 
potential mobilities, and another two active phase having one mobility each. These two active 
phases correspond to the two operation phases: forward driving, when the gear ratio is equal to one, 
and reverse driving, when the gear ratio is negative. The two types of cylindrical gear mechanisms 
used for reverse driving will be analyzed from a geometrical and a kinematical point of view. 
 
The spur gear mechanism 
 
For ordinary spur gear mechanisms (fig. 5) a collar m is used; this rotates together with the shaft 
of pulley disk Dc, through grooves. 
This mounting enables the collar m to move to the right in order to couple with gear 4 (forward 
driving) or the left in order to couple with gear 1 (reverse driving).

For reverse driving the collar m couples with the gear hub 1 so that the rotation notion is 
transmitted from the engine to the taper disk Dc through the kinematic chain formed by the exterior 
cylindrical gears (1,2), (2',3) and (3,4). 
The transmission ratio between the wheels 1 and 4 is expressed as follows:

Gear 3 is mounted off the vertical plane of the axles (see the left view in figure 5). 
 
The planetary cylindrical gear mechanism 
 
In this case (fig. 3 and 6), the neutral phase corresponds to the loose position of the two clutches 
(in fact one clutch and one brake) with multi-disks. The clutch is situated between the annulus gear 
4 and the planetary carrier (pulley disk Dc) p, and the brake is between the same annulus gear 4 and 
the fixed case 0 (fig. 6). Thus, by engaging the clutch (4, p), the engine shaft joins with the pulley 
disk Dc fixed onto the transmission driving shaft, which corresponds to the forward driving. 
If the brake is engaged (4, 0), the annulus gear 4 is locked, which makes the mechanism to 
operate like a mono-mobile planetary cylindrical gear set. 
Between central gears 1 and 4, the planetary gears 2 and 3 have been mounted, articulated to the 
planetary carrier p by mobile axles.

Synthesis of a new mechanism for reverse driving 
 
As compared to the kinematic scheme analyzed above (fig. 6) with 4 planetary gears, a new 
planetary cylindrical gear mechanism is proposed (fig. 7) with only 2 or 3 planetary gears. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 7 A new kinematic scheme of the reverse driving mechanism 
 
The neutral position of the proposed mechanism (fig. 7) is obtained if both multi-disk devices  
(clutch A and brake F) are disengaged. When engaging only the clutch A, the engine shaft is 
coupled with the pulley for forward driving. When engaging only the brake F (fig. 7), the planetary 
carrier p is locked, which makes the mechanism to operate as a spur gear.  
The transmission ratio for reverse driving can be expressed as follows:

Conclusions 
 
Both mechanisms used at present for reverse driving (CVT with metal V-belt), consist of at least 
five cylindrical gears. The planetary cylindrical gear mechanism used for reverse driving (fig. 3 or 
4) consists of multi-disk clutches and a large number of gears with determine a reduced efficiency.  
The new planetary reverse driving mechanism presented in this paper (fig. 7) is much simpler as 
it consists of only five cylindrical gears.

Abstract.  The paper presents 3D modeling of a trapezoidal element (V-element) of a metal pushing 
V-belt. This type of belt is used on the Continuously Variable Transmissions (CVT) with friction 
pulleys that equip low and medium capacity motor vehicles. Also, the structural analysis of the V-
belt element with regards to the material strength is presented. Modeling and simulation have been 
accomplished by an advanced CAD – CAM – CAE software which permits three-dimensional 
virtual design of the V-element or the entire belt. 
 
Introduction 
 
By means of an advanced CAD – CAM – CAE (Computer Aided Design, Manufacturing and 
Engineering) software system it is possible to model a component or mechanical assembly with any 
complexity level. Thus, some entities with precisely 3D dimensions can be modeled, on which 
certain materials with real properties can be applied, components that have their own characteristics 
which can be updated anytime. 
The parametrical design has the advantage that by modifying a geometrical parameter of the 
component, all the others dimensions will be changed automatically in correlation with the given 
constrains. The virtual reality allows behavior simulation during operation of every considered 
subassembly, the test accomplishes by means of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for static and/or 
frequency analyses [1].  
The generating of the subassembly finite elements is going on automatically by the software, and 
if it is necessary its resolution can be changed [1]. 
The static analysis allows the visualization of the stresses in any point of the structure, as well as 
the corresponding displacements [2]. There is the possibility to animate the deformation of the 
studied component and, in the case of too small real displacements, the user could increase the scale 
of movement representation [2, 3].  
The paper presents these applications on a metal V-element of the 24/10/2.25 V-belt (fig. 1), part 
of the CVT’s with friction pulleys (type VDT-P811), used on the medium capacity vehicles 
[4,5,7,8].

Dynamics of the Metal Pushing V-Belt 
 
 
For a correctly resistance verification of the V-belt, the case of a motor vehicle equipped with an 
internal combustion engine has been considered. The engine have the cylindrical capacity of 1557 
cm3 (Dacia Nova model) and operates at maximum torque and load (M max = 122.16 N⋅m), and the 
metal pushing V- belt CVT operates at maximum ratio (i max = 2.47). The stretching force in the 
steel bands of the metal V-belt [5, 6] has a constant value T0 (fig. 2).  
The fraction between pushing forces that acting into passive branch of the belt (when freely V-
elements enter in contact with driving pulley) and the pushing forces into active branch of the belt 
(when pressed V-elements leave the contact with driving pulley) respectively has, according to the 
Euler theory, the following form:

According to the limit transmitting condition of the engine torque, the traction belt force τ is 
equal to friction force between this and the pulley. Thus, by relation (8) the normal force to the

Structural Analysis of the V-elements 
 
The V-element modeling was accomplished by means of the CATIAÒ V5 software package [9]. 
First, the 2D sketching of the V-element with its all real dimensional characteristics has been 
modeled. Then, a thickness to the sketch has been given, so that a 3D body was obtained on which 
all the necessary fillets have been added. The 3° V-element cutting with a properly orientated plane 
with respect to the XOY plane was obtained by a special command. 
232
Current Solutions in Mechanical Engineering

The next step was the material applying with its all properties. For the 3D V-element-body the 
technical 2D drawing is made automatically by the software, with the most important views and 
sections. Also, the dimensions are manually and/or automatically created depending on necessities. 
For the calculus of the applied pressure on contact surfaces S of the V-element with pulleys, by 
relation (16), the formula has been used: 
 
S

p
el
=
.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
               
 
 
 
 
         
 
         (17) 
 
The imposed constrains of the V-element on contact surfaces with steel band sets (fig. 4), are that 
the linear displacement along Y axis is not allowed, and due to the fact that each V-element is 
situated between other two similar V-elements, the linear displacement along Z axis is not allowed 
too. Using a Turbo PascalÒ programming software the pressure p by means of chapter 2 relations 
and formula (17) has been calculated. 
For a complex structural analysis the whole 3D V-element in tetrahedral finite elements was 
automatically divided. Figure 4 shows the equivalent stresses distribution into belt V-element by the 
Von Mises criterion. In any point of this structure mesh the values of the equivalent stresses 
measured in  Pa [ N / m 2 ] can be visualized. The most stressed fibers are represented in red and the 
least stressed in blue, and in between the entire color spectrum is used.  
As shown in figure 4 and 5, the critical 
portions regarding to material strength are 
situated at principal fiber fillets of the V-
element with the sitting surfaces of the 
steel support-bands sets. Also, there are 
critical areas at the bottom of the body, 
nearly to the contact surfaces with CVT 
pulleys (concave surfaces). 
In order to be observed in detail the 
most stressed fibers of the V-element, 
“zoom in” command can reveal the 
propagation aspect of the equivalent stress 
“waves” into material structure (fig. 6). 
 
 
Fig. 5 The equivalent stresses distribution 
(from report-file of the structure analysis) 
 
In addition, the V-element was sectioned with a certain orientated plane so that the critical areas 
regarding to material resistance to be distinguished (fig. 7). The sectioning can be performed in any 
point of the body with a 3D orientated plane in any direction and it can be translated or rotated 
along a desired direction. 
An important characteristic of the used software is that the user can modify the deformation 
magnitude of the studied body, in order to see a real behavior visualization. Thus, figure 5 shows 
the equivalent stresses distribution into V-element body, which is deformed of approximate ten 
times.  This helpful representation can be applied on the global displacements distribution too.  
Whether or not the V-element deformation is exaggerated, this can be animated through a desired 
number of the frames (slides), so that each node displacement of the structure mesh can be 
simulated and thus, the global deformation of the body, during the pressures acting onto contact 
surfaces with CVT pulleys.

Conclusions 
 
 
From the specifically literature [5] the accepted stresses for a special steel as 41 Mo Cr 11 or 38 
Mo Cr Al 09 are 2.4 ... 3.9 ×  10 9 N / m 2 for the part kernel and 7 ... 9 ×  10 9  N / m 2  for the part 
flanks. Thus, the maximum obtained value of 3.47 ×  10 9 N/m 2 for the equivalent stress into belt V-
element, has been accepted to be not dangerous with regards to material strength (fig. 4-7).

The maximum value of the displacement ≈ 0.1 mm could seam too increased for the deformation 
of relative small dimension metal component such as the V-element.  However, in a special steel 
case there is a high flexibility and, in addition, the period when the CVT operates at this level is 
short.

Abstract. The study of bunk storage systems for motor vehicles has developed much lately due to 
high demand for parking in congested city centers. In this paper we propose to study the mechanism 
of drive bunk platforms for dynamic request. This paper aims to improve the response mechanism 
on a platform behaviour self during operation of the system and identify the points with maximum 
stress values. 
Introduction 
In previous work were presented mechanical and kinematical schemes of different types of 
existing storey car parks: bunk parking system with mobile boxes, in this case the platform is 
supported by a cable wound on a drum; car parks system, in this case the platform is supported by a 
cable or chain driven by an electric motor; bunk parking system with fixed boxes, car platform is a 
movement in the vertical and horizontal movement, it slides in the fixed structure of the drive shaft 
of the electric motor via a cable; second places parking system, in this case the car platform is 
driven by a hydraulic cylinder.  
These systems have a number of disadvantages to each type of structure established in part, 
however they are the best solution to achieve in crowded parking lots in the center of large cities 
where the ground surface does not allow the construction of a parking ground.      
Patterns of kinematical scheme for a parking structure bunk 
Fig. 1 presents the kinematical diagram of a parking system bunk with two storage locations of 
vehicles, the upper platform end is driven by an electrical motor Fig. 1. The space required for 
placing the system in Fig. 1 must be greater than the length of a car, because car parking on the 
upper platform to the lower platform flips. Platform system, presented in Fig. 1, can be driven by a 
cable wound on a drum driven by an electric motor. In the event of a system power failure, it can be 
equipped with a mechanism for manual operation or with an electrical generator.

Calculating and plotting stress σ 
To determine the stress equations, there are written σ stress equations using the Fig. 2 system. The 
equations of 2-1 gap from 2a: 
 
N21(t,k,a,l,r,F)= H1(t,k,a,l,F)- Q(t,k,a,l,r,F)⋅cosε; T21(t,k,a,l,r,F)= Q(t,k,a,l,r,F)⋅sinε- V1(t,k,a,l,F)   (4) 
M21(t,k,a,l,r,F,x)=-x⋅(H1(t,k,a,l,F)⋅sinα+V1(t,k,a,l,F)⋅cosα)+Q(t,k,a,l,F)⋅x⋅(sinε⋅cosα+cosε⋅sinα)

Data interpretation 
1. The maximum stress Comparing the two intervals (1-2 and 3-4) meets for:  
- t = 2s and F = 2000daN (range 3-4), the stress is directly proportional to the amount of force F. 
2. The distribution stress on the two intervals is constant and the ratio of stress increase is 
approximately constant in both cases. 
3.Pole-beam stress variation in point 2  
- for t = 2s and F = small variable is about 27daN / cm2,  
- for t = 10s and for F = variable, the variation is zero. 
4. The variation of beam stress poles in section 3  
- for t = 2s and F = 2000daN is less than 50daN/ cm2,  
- for t = 10s and F = 2000 daN the variation is zero. 
Conclusions 
Following the data analysis, we can identify the highest point of the mechanism called respectively 
the amplitude stress, depending on the position of the mechanism at a set time. 
Thye main conclusions of this present study are: the stress value decreases with the increasing time 
t, the stress is high value in the first seconds of the moment of stationary position as the platform 
reaches the locked position stress drops; the highest stress value is recorded in section 6 for F = max 
(F = 2000daN) and t = minimum (t = 2s), minimum value (σ = 0)  is in points 2 and 3 for t = 10s 
and F = 2000daN; the stress values are grouped into three values gaps depending on the time t and 
strength; the force distribution Q is constant throughout the platform gap, for t = 10s power Q is 
null; the force distribution ratio Q for t = 2s and F = variable is 2 times higher than force the Q for t 
= 6s and F = Variable; the maximum force Q is registered in the first platform seconds (t =2s and 
F=Variable).

Abstract. In this paper is performed an elasto-dynamic study of a steering mechanism from a road 
vehicle. Kinematical studies of the steering mechanism have been made especially on robots, their 
results being presented in scientific literature. The main purpose of this study is to reduce tires wear 
by optimizing the components of the steering mechanism. 
Introduction 
It is achieved the elastodynamic analysis of a tire rod from auto steering mechanism, by two 
methods, respectively an analytical method and an modal dynamic analysis processed in Adams 
environment. The entry data for booth methods have been experimentally established [6]. 
By analytic method is determined the mathematical models for displacements, velocities and 
longitudinal and transversal accelerations of the tie rod, considering the connecting forces from 
kinematic joints. Modal dynamic analysis processed in Adams allows establishing of frequencies 
and natural modes of vibration, using modal superposition method, and respectively tie rod dynamic 
response identification in elastic solid motion.    
The flexibility of the steering mechanism components is analyzed in paper [7] which is 
published by Wu J., from the institute of Research in Automotive Area, from China. The paper 
studies the effect of mechanical components deformability of the steering mechanism upon the 
steering. The vehicle model used for this study is a truck with traction 8x4, with two front axle used 
for steering. The steering and suspension mechanisms are treated in paper [1], where the kinematics 
and dynamics parameters are determined by taken into account the motion of components as rigid 
bodies. In paper [5] is studied the influence of tie rods deformability upon the steering rack and 
pinion transmission. Mathematical models for the study of mechanism considering elements as 
linear elastic are presented in papers [2,4]. 
Mathematical models for elastic longitudinal and transversal displacements 
It is developed the mathematical models for the analysis of the longitudinal and transversal 
deformations, from steering mechanism tie rod, in plane y-z. Tie rod 5 (Fig.1) is considered as a 
linear elastic element, articulated at both ends and with constant transversal section. 
We introduce the following notations: 
(z, y) – are the coordinates of joint H upon the reference (E);  
v	 = z t)k	∙+ y t)ȷ	∙-  is the velocity of joint H upon the reference (E);

Dynamic model of steering and suspension mechanisms build in Adams, allows the analysis of 
other elements as deformable solids, as the rack and pinion mechanical transmission. 
Elastodynamic analysis of the steering mechanism has two important components: modal 
analysis which consist in establish of natural frequencies and natural vibration forms; dynamic 
analysis, which consist in establish of variations laws for kinematic parameters of elements, 
markers or nodes in solid rigid motion or deformable solid. 
The entry data for modal dynamic analysis have been considered as follows: the vehicle was 
moving in straight line, with a know motion law; they have been considered external loads, 
respectively the weight forces on wheels, by 2500 N.

namely {x  y  z  ψ  θ  φ}T [3]; 
- modal dynamic analysis and establish of time variations laws for generalized coordinates of 
flexible elements, namely { x  y  z  ψ  θ  φ  qi}T[3];

considered a planar trajectory. Elasto-dynamic analysis consist in define of mathematical models 
for longitudinal and transversal elastic displacements of the tie rod, considering the reaction forces 
from the joints, based on Laplace and Fourier transformations. It is elaborated a program to process 
those models, based on initial conditions and boundary conditions, taking into account the 
kinematic parameters from the solid rigid motion, established experimentally. The answer interval 
was by 4 seconds. They are obtained 3D diagrams of displacements and acceleration variation for 
the tie rod longitudinal and transversal motion.  
Modal dynamic analysis with Adams, consist in: transfer of data basis from Solid Works in 
Adams, define of geometric model of the mechanism, considering the boundary conditions, mass 
properties and inertia of each element; define of markers as interest points to define correctly the 
kinematics joints, initial conditions or system loads; define of kinematic model of the mechanism, 
namely the kinematic joints, of reference systems attached to elements or centered in joints; define 
of solid deformable elements like the tie rods, based on finite element modal analysis; -meshing 
with finite elements tetrahedral type, identifying the nodes by means which the flexible -elements 
are connected with other elements; replacing the solid rigid elements with the flexible elements 
defined previously. 
Obtained numerical results with those two methods are difficult to compare, because in Adams 
simulation, the motion of the tie rod as deformable solid is spatial. The interface between analytical 
method and numerical method has been assured by experimental study of the steering mechanism, 
completed with modal analysis in Ansys [4]. Modal dynamic analysis and simulation in Adams 
allows studying the dynamic behavior of the tie rod as deformable body. On the other point of view 
the study of the tie rod as a deformable body, allows analyze their influence upon the geometrical 
and kinematical parameters of the steering system as assembly.

Abstract. The design of a vehicle suspension system starts with very few input parameters. Simple 
models are used during initial simulations in order to ensure the desired compromise between 
comfort and dynamic performance qualities, at different vehicle speeds and loads. That stage leads 
to the setup of the needed suspension parameters on the model, mainly the stiffness of the 
suspension springs and tires and the damping coefficient. 
In an algorithmic way, this paper summarizes design recommendations existing in the field of 
vehicle suspensions. Based on the procedure in this article, a computer program was implemented 
in the software MDesign.  
Introduction 
The main functions of the vehicle suspension system are: to cushion the shocks transmitted from 
the ground to the body; to dampen the oscillations of the body and wheels; to control and limit the 
relative wheel-body positions in order to optimize the wheel-ground interactions and to protect the 
parts that connect the running gear with the drivetrain and vehicle body. 
The functions of a passive suspension are realized by elastic elements, shock absorbers, and 
guiding mechanisms. The cushioning function is done by the elastic elements (suspension springs, 
tires, anti-roll bars, and bushings), able to store the energy of the mechanical shocks (induced by the 
ground unevenness) and to release that later, in a longer time interval. This way, the forces 
transmitted to the body and, consequently, its accelerations, will be smaller. 
The damping function of a passive suspension is realized mainly by the shock absorbers and, in 
a smaller measure, by the tires and the bushings. These dampers generate frictional forces opposing 
to the relative body-wheels movements, thus consuming the kinetic energy of the mechanical 
system and leading to the decrease of the oscillations amplitude.  
The aim of this work is to give the main directions to be followed during the earliest design 
stages of passive suspensions, or, in other words, to indicate the main steps needed to be done when 
the design starts from scratch.  
The main characteristics of a real suspension (the stiffness kSv of the spring and the damping 
coefficient cSv of the shock absorber) will be adopted with respect to the results obtained after the 
simulation based on mathematical models. 
Quarter-Car Suspension Model 
To understand the world, the humans imagined models. Models are representations, 
simplifications, abstractions, conceptualization, and interpretations of reality. (According to the 
dictionary definition, the “model” is a “theoretic or material system which can be used to indirectly 
study the properties and transformations of another more complex system that presents analogies 
with the first system”). The simulation is the process of models creation and logical manipulation in 
order to decide how the real world works. 
The study of the low-frequency vertical oscillations can be realized with simple models, 
considering the vehicle as a system consisting of undeformable bodies connected by massless 
springs and dampers.

Based on the principle that the best model is a simple one ensuring good results, the most often 
adopted model for the study of vehicle’s ride behavior and quality is the so-called “quarter-vehicle 
model” or “vehicle-corner model” [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. This includes only two elements 
with concentrated inertial properties: one for a wheel and the other for the part of the body 
supported by that wheel. Because in general the up-and-down movement presents most interest, 
only the mass properties of those inertial elements will be considered (neglecting the moments of 
inertia involved in rotations) and only one DoF, the vertical translation, will be taken into account 
for each body. 
The result is the model presented in Fig. 1, with a sprung mass (the vehicle body) and an 
unsprung mass (the wheel). The body is linked to the wheel through massless spring and damper, 
while the tire (represented here as a spring-damper combination) makes the connection between the 
wheel and the ground. This model is suited for frequencies up to 30 − 50 Hz, that are over the 
natural frequency of the unsprung mass. 
 
Fig. 1. Ride “quarter-vehicle model” with two DoFs (vertical translation of wheel and body) 
 
The excitation of the system is the force induced by the irregularities of the ground (road) 
surface. Thus, zR is the elevation of the surface profile (considered as function of the distance 
traveled by the vehicle) and  represents the vertical velocity of the tire at the ground contact point 
(which is the slope of the profile multiplied by the forward speed of the vehicle). 
The reference system is usually adopted in two variants: having a single origin (displacement 
z=0) for ground, wheel and body or having separate origins for the ground and masses. In that 
second case, shown in Fig. 1, the positions zi=0 will correspond to the equilibrium positions, that 
must be previously calculated. This way, the gravitational forces of the wheel and the body will not 
appear explicitly in the movement equation.  
By applying the Newton's second law to the sprung and unsprung masses, the system’s equations 
of motion can be obtained: 
mB · B = F1S + FD – WB 
(1) 
mW · W = F1T – (F1S + FD) – WW 
in the case of the absolute coordinate system, and respectively 
mB · B = FS + FD 
 (2) 
mW · W = FT – (FS + FD) 
in the case of the relative coordinate systems, with origins at the static equilibrium positions. 
 Here, the indices W, B, S, D and T stand respectively for wheel, body, spring, damper, and tire; so, 
mW and mB are the lumped masses of the wheel and body; WW and WB are the weights of the wheel 
and body; F is a force produced by spring or damper or tire. From the comparative study of the 
equations (1) and (2) it results: 
FS = F1S – WB            and            FT = F1T – WW – WB = F1T – Wtot, 
 (3) 
where Wtot = WW + WB is the total weight of a quarter of the vehicle. 
248
Current Solutions in Mechanical Engineering

Special attention must be payed to this aspect, because otherwise confusions may exist and 
wrong results may be obtained. 
The forces FT, FS and FD depend on displacements z, on velocities  and, possibly, on time t. 
Normally, these functions are (highly) unlinear. In these conditions, solving the system of equations 
(2) may represent a difficult task and can be realized in the general case only by approximate 
numerical methods [4]. 
Exact solutions for the equations system (1) or (2) were obtained only for linear functions F. For 
that reason, the assumption of linear equations systems is generally considered, in order to simplify 
the study of vehicle vibrations [1]. 
To approximate the actual non-linear equations system with a linear one, the spring 
characteristics (force vs. deflection) are approximated by a straight line in the range of operation, 
while the damping, which contains both hydraulic and dry (Coulomb) friction components, will be 
approximated with a viscous damping. More precisely, one considers that: the spring force FS is 
proportional with the spring deflection zW – zB; the damper force FD is proportional with the relative 
speed of the damper ends W – B; the tire force FT has an elastic component, proportional to the 
tire deflection zR – zW, and a viscous friction component, proportional to the speed of the tire 
deflection R – W. 
With these explanations, the system of equations (2) takes the well-known shape [1], [2], [4], [5], 
[6], [7]: 
mB · B = kS ·(zW – zB) + cD·(W – B) 
 (4) 
mW · W = kT ·(zR – zW) + cT·(R – W) – kS ·(zW – zB) - cD·(W – B) 
where the constant values kS and kT are the stiffness coefficients of the model’s spring and tire, 
whille cD and cT are the viscous damping coefficients of the model’s damper and tire. 
It must be noted that the study of the oscillations based on simple models, including only lumped 
masses (rigid bodies) and linear springs and dampers, can be made only for small amplitudes, 
because only in this case a linear approximation with sufficient precision can be achieved for those 
nonlinear elements. Also, it must be remembered that the tire-ground force is a contact force, which 
means it is absolutely necessary that F1T ≥ 0 or FT ≥ -Wtot (if the tire leaves the ground, no force will 
act on the tire tread). 
Estimation of the Quarter-Car Model Parameters 
In the predesign stage of the suspension, the number of known input data is very small. 
Fortunately, few parameters are needed to solve the linear equation system (4). 
A possibility for the initial approximation of the needed data it is presented next. 
Knowing the mass mtot sustained by the wheel, and adopting statistical proportions, the masses 
mW and mB can be approximated. Books as [1], [2], [5] or OEMs statistics as [8] indicate that the 
mass of the wheel mW represents 10…15% of the total mass mtot (smaller percentages for cars with 
non-driving wheels and independent suspensions and larger percentages for heavy vehicles with 
driving and rigid axles). 
In the same books it is also mentioned that the tire stiffness is about 10 times bigger (or more) as 
the spring stiffness (kT ≅ 10·kS), while the damping coefficient ratio of the tire and damper has an 
inversed value (cT ≅ 0.1·cD). More than that, in some works, such as [2] and [5], it is indicated that 
the tire damping is small and its influence can be neglected (cT ≅ 0), mainly in the early stages of 
the suspension design. 
Taking the movement equation of the body in the system (1) and considering the vehicle at rest, 
it results: 
 F1S = kS · dSst = WB = mB · g 
(5) 
which permits to calculate the model’s spring stiffness kS if one knows the static deflection of the 
spring dSst. In [2] it is recommended for cars a mean value dSst=254 mm. 
 
Applied Mechanics and Materials Vol. 823
249

These method is in fact equivalent with the one in which the natural frequency of the body,  
fBn = 
&'(
)*  = 
+
)* ,
-.
/' ,  
(6) 
it is adopted, because this also allows to calculate the model’s spring stiffness: 
kS = mB ·(2π fBn)2. 
(7) 
For street cars, the recommended value of the natural frequency fBn (in the absence of damping) 
is about 1…1.5 Hz [1], [2], [5]. This corresponds to the walking frequency, at which the humans 
resist better in standing position. More stiff suspensions are used for race cars, and the natural 
frequency can be in the range 2…2.5 Hz [5] or even can reach 3 Hz [9]. That means, if compared 
with a street car, the springs of a race car may be 9 times stiffer! 
Replacing kS/mB from the equations (5) in the equations (6) it results the relationship between the 
static deflection of the spring dSst and the natural frequency of the body fBn: 
dSst = 
3
()*4'()5 . 
(8) 
The natural frequency of the wheel, also called wheel hop frequency, will be influenced both by 
the stiffness of the spring and tire (kS and kT), because the two springs are working in parallel: 
fWn = 
&7(
)*  = 
+
)* ,
-.8-9
/7  . 
(9) 
If one notes with ik=kT/kS the ratio of the tire and spring stiffness and with im=mW/mB the ratio of 
wheel and body masses, then, using equations (6) and (9), the wheel hop frequency can be 
calculated versus the body’s natural frequency: 
fWn = fBn· ,
+8;<
;=  . 
(10) 
For example, if ik=10 and im=1/9, then the wheel’s natural frequency will be 9.95 times bigger as 
the body’s natural frequency. 
The last input data necessary to completely define the quarter-car model is the coefficient of 
damping cD. This value can be estimated on the base of the damping ratio, defined as 
ξD = 
@A
)B-.∙/' . 
(11) 
The damping ratio equal with the unit, ξD = 1, it is named critical damping ratio. Smaller values 
of the damping ratio, ξD < 1, will still permit relative body-wheel oscillations, while bigger values, 
ξD > 1, will cancel the oscillation (after excitation, the body will approach asymptotically the static 
equilibrium position). 
It should be mentioned that the suspension’s damping ratio (provided mainly by the shock 
absorbers) is usually in the range of 0.2…0.4 for street passenger cars [1], [2], [5], while values of 
0.8…0.9 are frequently found in race cars [9].  
Adopting such a value for the damping ratio, the coefficient of damping cD can be calculated 
based on the equation (11) and now the “quarter-vehicle” model is fully defined. 
Starting for the system of movement equations (4), the transmissibility functions of the model 
(which are also the transfer functions, because the mathematical model of the “quarter-car” is 
linear) can be now written (as in [10] or [3]), calculated and graphically represented (as in the Figs. 
2 and 3). Based on the transmissibility functions, the input data of the model can be changed so that 
the ride behavior to correspond better to the requirements (comfort, road holding or a combination 
of both). 
The ground-body transmissibility of the accelerations (the ratio of the maximum acceleration of 
the body and the maximum acceleration of the ground [2]) is given by the equation 
Tarb(ω) =  
-F-58; -F @ &
G &HI[-F8-5(+8G)]&58-F-58; [-F@ & I(+8G) @ &L]

where χ = mW/mB is the ratio of the unsprung and sprung masses; k1=kT/mB, k2=kS/mB and c=cD/mB 
are the tire stiffness, spring stiffness and damper coefficient divided by the body mass. 
That function is often used to characterize the suspension, because it indicates how the ground 
irregularities are felt into the vehicle body. Generally, for typical passenger cars the peak value of 
this amplitude ratio is in the range of 1.5…3 (in Fig. 2 a ratio of 2.2 can be observed), while for 
typical heavy trucks the peak value is dependent on the road and operating conditions, but in the 
worst case may reach levels as high as 5 or 6 [2]. 
The ground-body transmissibility of the accelerations is very sensitive to the damping level and 
so it can be controlled through a well-choose damping ratio ξS.  
For a comfortable ride, the acceleration of the sprung mass must be kept to a minimum. Because 
that, a reasonable way to optimize the suspension is to choose a value of damping ratio that, on the 
ground-body accelerations transmissibility curve, generates a relative maximum (or at least a 
stationary point) for different damping ratios at the frequency

Even though this value of damping is effective in keeping the acceleration low in a wide 
frequency range (exceeding the natural frequency of the wheel), it is not always adopted because 
the passive suspension must realize a compromise between the ride performances, on one side, and 
the traction, braking and handling performances, on the other side.

It will be mentioned here also that the peak value of the ground-body transmissibility must be 
verified both for the loaded and unloaded vehicle, where the rear axle put the biggest problems due 
to a larger change of the mass.

where kech = kT · kS / (kT + kS) is the equivalent stiffness of the suspension (two springs in series). 
Due to the relative small values of the damping ratio ξD of street cars, the natural frequency with 
damping is a little bit larger than the natural frequency without damping. 
A strong interest in the suspension behavior present also the tire deflection, zR-zW, and the 
suspension stroke, zW-zB [8]. Both can be characterized by the absolute values Tddef=|(zR-zW)/zR|=1-
|zW/zR| and Tdstr=|(zW–zB)/zR|=|zW/zR–zB/zR|, functions that indicate how the amplitude of the road 
irregularities are producing tire deflection and suspension stroke, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Values 
larger than 1 indicate amplification, while smaller values mean attenuation. 
Conclusions 
For the study of the ground vehicles suspensions simple dynamic and mathematic models are 
used, mainly in the first stages of the design process. For the primary suspension set-up, the 2 DoF 
“quartet-vehicle model” is the most used, due to its good quality result-complexity ratio. 
This article discusses many of the aspects involved in the model simulation of vehicle 
suspension behavior. Based on the algorithm presented here a computer model was implemented in 
the MDesign software [11], which may be used by automotive engineers or students to realize the 
initial steps in the design of vehicle suspension.

Abstract: The paper aims at issuing of a virtual simulation model that would be able to assess the 
actual working modes of a torque converter, both hydraulically and mechanically. To estimating the 
dynamic behavior we used the assessing equations of the converter’s performance coefficients. The 
rotational inertial phenomena due to the transient regimes during the getaway phase are also 
considered. The modeling process assumed the use of the pre-defined structures of the  
Simulink-Matlab and Simscape-Matlab modules. The virtual model of the torque converter was fed 
with the experimentally determined, performance parameters as input. The input also consisted of 
the inertia moments of the converter’s components. Eventually, by interrogating the simulation 
model, we’ve got and plotted the time histories of the converter’s impeller and turbine angular 
velocities during the vehicle’s getaway process. 
Introduction 
Many references took into account the possibility to simulate the dynamic behavior of various 
types of hydraulic couplings. T. Ishihara and R.I. Emori [1] published a keystone work in this 
respect since it presents the real (physical) behavior of an actual torque converter both in the steady 
and transient operating modes. These authors developed a mathematical model based on three, first 
order, differential equations that estimate de converter’s parameters, i.e. 
h
K  - torque ratio and K  - 
absorption coefficient, previously experimentally determined. The first two equations are written 
with respect to the converter’s turbine and impeller with the help of the kinetic momentum 
conservation law. The equations have been issued taking into account the inertia moments of the 
impeller, turbine and of the working fluid within the converter. The third equation has been issued 
with the help of the energy conservation law. From the data obtained as results of the simulation 
they could notice that the effect due to the fluid’s mass inertia is negligible. The authors noticed that 
the differential equations describing the steady regime could replace the ones describing the 
transient regime. This conclusion relies on the simulation’s results, which proved that the numbers 
describing the converters’ parameters are almost similar for both modes. Moreover, the 
experimental data proved the same. 
Another important work is the one developed by Hrovat and Tobler [2]. They evaluate the torque 
converter’s dynamics by a system of four, first order differential equations. Besides the first three 
(found by T. Ishihara and R.I. Emori) Hrovat uses another one describing the dynamics of the stator 
of the converter (written on the basis of the angular momentum theorem). Comparing the 
experimental and theoretical results validates the model.

Issuing the virtual simulation model of the hydraulic torque converter 
The simulation model was developed within the Matlab programming environment, using its 
SIMSCAPE and SIMULINK modules. At its turn, the model was integrated within an energetic 
network that simulates the longitudinal dynamics of a vehicle. It provides data with respect to the 
engine-converter fitting, converter’s characteristics and turbine’s output. When developing the 
simulation model (Fig. 1), we took into account the equations describing the real (actual) behavior 
of the hydraulic coupling [3].

 as the loading

The values of 
h
K  - torque ratio and K  - absorption coefficient were experimentally determined 
[4]. To getting within the simulation model the variation of the above- mentioned parameters versus 
the reversed cinematic ratio, ihprim, we interpolated the experimental data using the Spline 
functions (”Lookup Table” block in Matlab). The equations describing these parameters were 
modeled using Simscape-Matlab Library according to their definitions (Fig. 1). Thus, the model 
transforms the input physical signals (impeller’s and turbine’s angular speeds respectively) into 
output signals as 
Ht
M
 and 
Hp
M
 - the loading torque on the turbine’s and impeller’s shafts 
respectively.

We used the „maxim” block to avoid discontinuities (null denominator). We used the „minim” 
block to limit the value of the reverse cinematic ratio (set its value to maximum 1). The „switch” 
blocks are used to model the switch between the hydro coupling mode and the mechanic coupling 
mode of the converter. The signal that commands the modes’ switching threshold was inserted into 
the net by the means of the „viteza” block. This block takes the vehicle’s speed signal from the 
vehicle’s simulation model [3]. 
After modeling the converter’s parameters’ equations we input the model to SIMSCAPE (Fig. 2) 
module. To achieving this, the output physical signals, 
Ht
M
 and 
Hp
M
 were turned into mechanical 
power fluxes that are featured by the Simscape [5] programming environment as „across” (angular 
speed) and „through” (torque). That was possible by using the „ideal torque source” blocks. 
 
 
Fig. 2 – Inserting the simulation model into the Simscape programming environment 
 
At this point, the modeling of the converter’s hydraulic mode is achieved. Nevertheless, during 
the getaway process, the converter works as a mechanical (stiff) coupling as well. Modeling this 
phase is achieved by inserting the „disk friction clutch” (Fig. 4) block into the model. The „Control 
AHC” (Fig. 3) block models the timing of engaging the converter’s clutch.

Results 
The transformation process and the networking of the torque and angular speed within the 
energetic net of the torque converter can be seen in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. The drawing provides 
information with respect to both hydraulic and mechanic modes of the converter. In the same time,

Conclusions 
As expected, during the period the vehicle travels with the converter’s clutch in the “engaged” 
mode, both impeller’s and turbine’s angular speed as well as their torque are the same. The model 
assumes them to be a single part, as an elastic shaft with two inertial masses at its ends. 
As far as the other gears are concerned and the converter’s clutch is “disengaged” the load 
differs, due to the “torque converter” mode of the hydraulic coupling. The power flow varies 
according to the torque ratio and the reverse cinematic ratio respectively. 
Consequently, the simulation model of the torque converter is able to assess its working modes, 
both hydraulic and mechanic. 
On the other hand, we think that the main advantage of this simulation program is its versatility. 
Hence, it is enough to change the program’s parameters and we could have different kind of torque 
converter. This leads to the possibility to get a thorough analysis of the getaway process of the 
vehicles that have torque converters within their drivelines. Nevertheless, there are many simulation 
programs in this respect but we think that this one provides a more effective tool since it allows 
mixing the experimental data with theoretical assumptions. Therefore, we could state that its 
accuracy is higher than of many of the previous simulations. 
As a good example, the simulation we performed herein is consistent with the experimental data 
for a military vehicle getaway process.

Abstract: Implementation of an algorithm as a software module is not an easy task for a mechanical 
engineer. Usually the design engineer needs to be assisted by a programmer when a new software 
module is to be designed. The MDesign approach offers a way to create custom calculation modules 
by the user himself, who in this case is the automotive engineer, using only basic programming 
knowledge. This paper is focused on the development of a computation software module when the 
algorithm is already established. It is presented the case of the independent suspension predesign 
algorithm, but the same way is used for any other mechanical system. The MDesign framework was 
created for mechanical design and it was extended with a custom component dedicated to 
automotive engineering. A calculation module consists of program code and data, and is designed to 
execute an implemented algorithm and to provide the user with some text and graphics information. 
Introduction 
Mechanical design is one of the activity that benefits most from the evolution of information 
technology, starting with the introduction of CAD (Computer Aided Design) on personal 
computers, and then with the development of analysis, simulation and design management software. 
A special attention was given to the management of documents and product data. Now all the 
departments involved in the design process have access to all data and documents of their 
enterprise, thanks to the high-end PDM (Product Data Management) software and PLM (Product 
Lifecycle Management) solutions [1]. The analysis and simulation tools help engineers to optimize 
and verify the geometry and functionality of component and systems. However, apart from being 
supported by a number of software tools aimed at modeling, simulation and data storage, design 
engineers don’t get much assistance [2] - technical management hasn’t realized the full potential of 
workflow in conjunction with information technology. That means there is still much to work in the 
field of computer assisted engineering, and this is not limited to analysis like finite elements method 
or mechanism simulations.  
In the first stage of designing a new system, the engineer has to take some important decisions 
regarding the functionality, dimensions and material. This is the predesign phase, where the 
experience has an important role, and many verification calculations are done. This is also the case 
of the automotive suspension system. There are some different possibilities to realize the functions 
of the suspension. In case of a passive suspension are used elastic elements, shock absorbers and 
guiding mechanisms. 
The algorithm implemented and presented further in this paper refers mainly to the strut-and-arm 
independent suspension and to the short-long A-arm independent suspension, but the application 
can be easily adapted for other suspension types. The model used is described in detail in [3], and 
here only the basic approach is presented. 
The programming environment chosen is MDesign, a software package created especially to help 
mechanical engineers at their technical calculations. What is special at this software package is that

it offers the user the possibility to create his own calculation modules, using a custom programming 
interface. 
MDesign Environment 
General Presentation. MDesign is a software package that consists in a group of software 
components and applications for mechanical engineering [4]. The main components of the package 
are:   
- MDesign Author, which is an authoring tool used to develop application libraries; 
- the know-how components consolidated in these application libraries; 
- MDesign Explorer, which is the graphical work environment (GUI);  
- the database and communication infrastructure linked to the server. 
MDesign Explorer is designed for technical calculations and includes many catalogue functions. 
It offers also access to databases and technical documents, including drawings and models. 
The user interface has the common functionality of Windows applications, having the menus and 
toolbars intuitive and easy to find. There main user interface has some dedicated areas:  
- an area for inputs, where the user add entry values for input variables of the calculation; 
- an area for results, where are displayed the calculation results; 
- an area for text help, where can be found explanations about how the calculation is performed, 
calculation steps, formulas, standards or other documents; 
- an area for graphic help, where can be displayed graphics in various formats. The same area can 
be used to plot diagrams resulted from the calculation. 
Fig. 1 shows the user interface of MDesign when a calculation is running. The four main areas 
can be easily observed: the input and output areas above the text and graphic help areas.  
 
 
Fig. 1. The user interface of MDesign when running a calculation 
 
The input and output areas of the user interface are not displayed sequentially. Both areas are 
visible on the screen at the same time and the user can change any input data, then press again the 
"calculation" button to see the new results in the output area of the screen. This way, a feedback 
loop is implemented, as shown in the diagram in Fig. 2 (a). This functionality is already 
implemented in MDesign basic framework, so the programmer doesn't need to spend time with

implementing a user friendly interface. And the interface is the same for any other calculation 
modules, so the user doesn't have to accommodate with the software for any different calculation.

MDesign Author. The authoring tool is a separate part of the MDesign environment and it is not 
mandatory for the functioning of the already existent calculation modules. On the other hand, 
authoring tool needs the explorer component in order to run a newly developed module (when the 
"Run" button is pressed in the programming environment, it is automatically launched the 
Explorer). Although the possibilities are wide and very complex applications can be created, the 
basic functionality is very simple and includes three steps: define input variables, define output 
variables and write the code for calculation of each output variable.  
All calculations carried out using this tool have a unique ergonomic interface for the ultimate 
user. The programmer (the author of calculations) receives a "comfortable development 
environment of input templates, output sheets, calculation algorithms and help information" [5]. On 
this way, as stated in the MDesign Author programming manual, a calculation procedure is 
developed, carefully documented and ready to be used directly. 
As in any computer program, some decisions need to be taken during calculation, which need to 
be implemented in the software. A typical example is illustrated in Fig. 2 (b) and is dealing with the 
availability of the input data. There are situations where input data are available, but sometimes 
those data are not available and have to be assumed using default values or default calculation (like 
the unsprung mass in the case of the automotive suspension). So, not only variables and operators 
are used, but also conditional instructions (if). These lead to more complex instructions like loops 
(for, while); also complex data types, like arrays and structures can be declared; in other words, it is 
a programming interface inside the engineering calculation tool. 
MDesign Author uses a proprietary programming language, which is derived from C++ 
language, but the syntax is closer to Pascal, which is simpler and more appropriate for non-
programmer developers. The user friendly interface of MDesign Author is shown in Fig. 3. As can 
be seen, the text and graphic help areas are presented also in this interface, and a special button 
(with caption "Project information") allows the user to configure the content of these areas. The 
graphic help area can be changed also by program, so it is possible to create custom drawings during 
the program execution, like the diagrams created with our application and presented further in this 
paper.

Implementation of the suspension predesign algorithm 
The dynamic behavior of the vehicle can be characterized by input-output relationships. As 
explained in [3], the input may be the force induced by the irregularities of the road surface. The 
output will be the vibrations of the car body. The ratio of output and input amplitudes represents a 
"gain" for the dynamic system, known as "transmissibility", a non-dimensional ratio of response 
amplitude to excitation amplitude for a system in steady-state forced vibration. The ratio may be one 
of forces, displacements, velocities or accelerations. 
The model of the suspension used is presented in Fig. 4, according also to [3] and [6]. The body 
(sprung mass) is linked to the wheel (unsprung mass) through a system composed by spring and 
damper without mass, while the tire (also a spring-damper system) makes the connection with the 
ground. The sprung mass and the unsprung mass are input data, as well as the natural frequency of 
the body. The output variables include the stiffness of the spring, the static deflection of the spring, 
the damping coefficient of the suspension and finally the transmissibility (of accelerations) for 
various situations. 
 
Fig. 4. Basic suspension model [3] 
 
The algorithm starts from the Newton's second law applied to the sprung and unsprung masses, 
so the system’s equations of motion will be obtained. Considering the vehicle at rest, the force 
produced by the spring (between body and wheel) can be expressed as: 
 
F1S = kS · dSst = WB = mB · g 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1)

where kS is the spring stiffness, dS is the spring displacement (static in this case), while WB is the 
body weight and, consequently, mB is the body mass and g is the gravity acceleration. All these are 
applied to a quarter of the vehicle (with four wheels). 
On the other hand, the natural frequency of the body is:

Starting from Eq.2, the stiffness of the spring can be calculated, as the natural frequency of the 
body is adopted, according to the literature (1 - 1.5 Hz, according to [6]). It is not the goal of this 
paper to present the algorithm in detail, but to show how this is implemented as a software 
calculation module. In MDesign Author, the input variables (the masses, the natural frequency) are 
defined in the user interface, as real numbers, without the need to write explicit code. The user has 
also the possibility to choose the type of data and the units (for example, if the input variable 
represents a force, the user can choose the unit as N, kN or other derived from these). When defined 
the output variable (kS), the programming environment will also define automatically a calculation 
procedure. The user (programmer) has to input the code of the calculation procedure, like in this 
example: 
 
Procedure Calculate_ks() 
begin 
 
wni= M_PI*2*fci; 
 
ks = Msi*wni*wni; 
end 
 
where the name of variables corresponding to the input/output values as per Eq.1 and Eq.2 are: 
fci for fB, Msi for mB and M_PI is the constant p.  
Normally, the masses are input data, but if the unsprung mass is not known, it can be adopted as 
percentage of (in example is 10%) the whole mass (on that wheel), and the calculation procedure 
will follow the diagram in Fig. 2 (b). 
Similar functions are developed for the others output variables, and finally the transmissibility 
functions are calculated. These are implemented using a for loop. Inside this loop is called a graphic 
procedure that draws a line between two points (the coordinates are given by the values of the 
current frequency and the value calculated for the transmissibility function). Before (or after) the 
loop is called a dedicated procedure that define the general layout of the diagram, with axes and text 
and so on (see Fig. 5 - the diagram in figure is exactly as it is generated by the software function).

This is only a part of the whole calculation. The output variables defined in this first part are used 
then in the calculation of spring and damper.  
Conclusion 
An MDesign module is a unit consisting of program and data, designed to carry out a calculation 
or another algorithm and to be able to provide the user with text and graphics information [5]. Using 
the authoring tool of the MDesign package, a custom module was created, to assist the engineers 
with predesign of an automotive suspension. Unlike other software development tools, MDesign 
Author can add some limit values for input variables when these are declared, using a friendly 
dialog box. So the programmer don't need to take care about all the error treatments needed. Also 
the units of measure are predefined, helping the final user to add correct values in the input area. 
The graphic functions are simple, but it is possible to create schematic drawings and diagrams, at 
run time. The presented example does not cover all the possible situations, but can be extended for 
any new case, as needed. This module is intented to be a part of a comprehensive library dedicated 
to automotive systems - an useful tool for design engineers and also for students.

Abstract. In this paper it is presented the design optimization of the rear wing of a sports car having 
traction on rear axle. The wing profile was parameterized with three variables, the angle of attack 
was the fourth variable and the objective function was to minimize the lift over drag ratio. Three 
virtual models were considered: a model without rear wing, a model with a rear wing with initial 
profile and position and a model with optimized rear wing. For these three models the drag and lift 
coefficients were calculated for comparison along with drag and lift forces. 
1. Introduction 
Sports cars are subjected to permanent improvement about their performance by increasing the 
grip. This can be done by increasing the weight of the car or increasing the aerodynamic downforce. 
The first method is not acceptable while many advantages can be obtained through the second 
method: a higher grip means higher traction force, better cornering and braking [2]. 
The rear wing is an important element with a major role in the aerodynamic behaviour of a sports 
car. A good design of the rear wing can obtain a higher downforce but can negatively affect the 
drag force. 
For aerodynamic purposes, different wing profiles can be used in aviation, car races etc. NACA 
profiles [1, 3] are the preferred profiles by designers. In example, a NACA profile with four digits 
(Fig. 1) is defined by analytic expressions and it was used for the simulations in this paper.

The parameters of the NACA profile from figure 1 are, accordingly: 
- 
M is the maximum camber divided by 100. In the figure, M=4 so the camber is 0.04 or 4% of 
the chord;

- 
P is the position of the maximum camber divided by 10. In the figure, P=4 so the maximum 
camber is at 0.4 or 40% of the chord. 
- 
T (XX) is the thickness divided by 100. In the figure, XX=12 so the thickness is 0.12 or 12% 
of the chord. 
 
The NACA profile is created from a camber line and a thickness distribution plotted 
perpendicular to the camber line [3]. The equation of the camber line is divided in two parts, one is 
defined from 0 to P (position of maximum camber) and other from P to 1. The camber line is 
defined in the [0, 1] interval (see Eq. 1) and for certain purposes the user must scale the wing 
profile.

2. Virtual model 
For the purposes of the aerodynamic analyses two virtual models of an Audi TT sports car were 
considered: (Fig. 3) Model 1 without rear wing and Model 2 with rear wing. For Model 2 the rear 
wing used the profile from Fig. 2, and the position of the wing was chosen after the original car’s 
blueprints. 
 
 
Fig. 3. Left: initial model (Model 1); right: model with rear wing (Model 2) 
 
Each model was imported into ANSYS for aerodynamic analysis. A tunnel (air domain) was 
built around the car and after the extraction of the car’s volume (Fig. 4) the domain was discretized 
using tetrahedral finite elements (Fig. 5 for Model 1, Fig. 6. for Model 2).

Around the extracted car’s volume, where the velocity of the air was set to 0 m/s, a prismatic 
zone with 5 layers was built, having a ratio of 1.2 growth from interior to exterior. The same 
procedure was set to the surface of the road. 
The boundary condition were set for both Model 1 and Model 2, as shown in Fig. 7: a 40 m/s air 
velocity was set on the inlet surface (blue zone) and on the outlet surface (red zone) an atmospheric 
pressure was set (0 Pa gauge). For side and top walls, it was set a zero shear stress boundary (white 
zones) and for the car’s surfaces and for road were used wall surfaces with viscous frictional stress.

The pressure distribution and streamline for Model 1 and for Model 2 are shown in Fig. 8 and 
Fig. 9. For Model 2 a higher pressure can be observed on the rear of the car resulting in a lower 
global lift force. The drag and lift coefficients values and the drag and lift forces values are shown 
in Table 3. 
3. Design optimization of the wing 
Using the NACA profile parameters and the angle of attack as design variables, the restrictions 
were set as the minimum and maximum allowable values for design variables, as shown in Table 1.

4. Conclusions 
In this paper, the authors presented a design optimization of a rear wing for a sports car. Using a 
NACA profile with 4 digits (three parameters) and the angle of attack as the fourth parameter, the 
best design for the wing could be determined using Ansys Fluent. This best design of the wing can 
obtain a 96.5% reduced overall lift which will increase the grip for the tractive wheels. The drag 
force has increased with 6.37%, but the lift over drag ratio was minimized so the effect of the lift 
has a major role for dynamic response of the car.

Abstract. In this paper is made a tridimensional model for the stand use for the testing of 
helicoidally springs from automotives suspension using Solid Works soft. Then, it is realized the 
simulation for the testing of helicoidally springs. On this 3D-model is realized a dynamic analysis 
for the stand for obtaining the variation of stresses and deformation for all parts of this stand.  
Introduction [1] 
The automotives comfort is influenced by the vibrations of the suspension system of the 
automotive. The main element from the structure of the suspension system of the automotive is the 
helicoidally spring. From this reason, the dynamic and modal analysis of the helicoidally spring 
presents a great importance. It is necessary a dynamic analysis of the stand for a good working of 
the stand. In this scope, is modeled the stand by 3D model and then, is made a simulation during the 
testing of helicoidally spring used in the car suspension structure. 
 
1. Modeling of stand [3] 
The modeling of the stand consists in the building of a three-dimensional virtual model. This 
model is based on the real values of the masses and dimensions of the real stand.   
The virtual model of the stand is made using SolidWorks soft. This model presents the advantage 
that it can be modified because it is a parameterized representation of the elements from the 
structure of the stand.  
The testing of the helicoidally springs on this stand refers to the analysis of the spring depending 
on the configuration of the road. To simulate the irregularities of the road, the motion of automotive 
is transmitted to spring by a mechanism with cam-follower roll. The follower roll picks up the 
motion from the profile of the cam.   
The geometrical elements of the cam profile (throw action, angles, over-height) are chosen   for a 
better configuration of the irregular road. 
The 3D-model of the stand is presented in the Fig. 1.

In the Fig. 2 is represented the superior part of the stand. The stand is acted by an electrical motor 
(presented only in the Fig. 1). The rotation motion of the motor shaft is transmitted to a cam with 
presents an over raise h. The follower roll picks up the motion from the cam transforming into a 
vertical translation motion. The inferior plate is acted by the force from the rod obtaining the 
helicoidally spring motion. Thus, it is simulated the automotive wheel motion on the road with an 
irregularity with h height. In the Fig. 3 there are represented elements which compound the superior 
part of the stand.

Then, it is made an analysis for determine the stresses and the deformations of the element from 
the stand structure.  The maps of the stresses (von Misses) are presented in the Fig. 7 - Fig. 9 for the 
same moments as those corresponding to moments of Fig. 5. These are obtained for the testing of a 
helicoidally spring with the following parameters: the number of spires = 11, diameter of 
helicoidally spring = 110mm, diameter of wire = 12mm and for a force equal to 1500 N.

 Conclusions 
 
 
 
Analyzing the Fig. 7 – Fig. 10 ( in which isn’t represented the bottom zone of the stand), it is 
observed that by modification the angular velocity for the electric motor are modified the values for 
the stresses. In the Fig. 7, Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, it is obvious that the appearance of the red zones in the

zone of the frontal screw from right position. In the extreme, it is happened a situation such as that 
of  Fig. 10. In this case (the map of stresses are coloured in red for elements of the stand), it is 
“reached” a dangerous situation in which stresses are values which overcome the admissible limits. 
Each element of the stand can be broken and the stand can be destroyed.  
 
To avoid this situation, it is necessary to make a simulation of the stand motion during the 
testing of the helicoidally spring

Abstract: The paper presents a structural analysis of the complex mechanisms type screw-jack. The 
mechanism mobility analysis using various generally applicable formulas has been performed. A 
new kinematic scheme of the jack linkage has been proposed. Besides the actuator screw, it has a 
planar kinematic chain with articulated bars. With regard to this new mechanism, an algorithm for 
static calculus has been developed, in which the automobile gravity force is the main exterior force. 
 
Introduction 
 
  Jacks are devices used for lifting loads at a low height without any lifting part. Jack building 
forms depend both on the load lifting way and on their driving type. 
      Furthermore, we shall present several kinematic schemes for different types of lifting 
mechanisms used for car mechanical jacks [1, 2].

Structure and mobility of the variable direction screw-jack mechanism 
 The variable direction screw-jack (fig. 1b, fig. 3) is fixed to the ground by means of a support leg 
frame bar 5.  
    Among mechanical jacks, the most common ones are those provided with a motion screw, where 
the jack is actuated by rotating the lever attached to the screw. 
Such a jack type is presented in the figures below with: 
- the kinematic scheme of the lifting mechanism (fig. 3a). 
- photo image of the screw-jack with a support arm under load (fig.3b).

Fig. 3. Lifting mechanism of a screw-jack with a support arm 
 
 The kinematic scheme of the analyzed mechanism (fig. 3) shows that it includes a closed 
kinematic chain, formed of the elements 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Among these kinematic elements, bar 5 
acts as a fixed element 0, once it is supported on the horizontal plane. 
 This closed kinematic chain is a spatial 3D chain as the rotation of element 1 (the driving screw) 
goes beyond the motion plane of the other parts. 
In order to use this jack (fig. 3b) we mount the support bar 5 (fig. 3a) on the horizontal surface 
close to the car body that is about to be lifted. 
The space associated to the closed kinematic chain has the rank r = 4, and thus the mobility of 
this screw mechanism can be determined with formula P. Antonescu [1]

Visually inspecting the jack mechanism (fig. 3a), we notice that all kinematic couplings have a 
single mobility (

. Kinematic couplings are the overlapping articulations 
A(1,2) (2,5) and the articulations B(3,4) as well as C(4,5). 
It should be mentioned that the screw coupling (1,3) overlaps in B, whose mobility

like with the articulation, as there is an interdependence between the two relative rotation and 
translation motions ϕ  and s, through the p lead of the motion screw:

the joint lever with screw 1 (fig. 3a). 
Thus, by rotating lever 1 with momentum Mm object 3 moves vertically and surpasses the

Topological structure and mobility of the screw-jack with bars and spur gears 
Let us consider a mechanical screw-jack with bars and cylindrical gears (fig. 2a, fig. 4) in the 
rest position, next to a car (fig. 4a) and under load, in the working position (fig. 4b).

Fig. 4. Screw-jack with bars and gears: resting position (a) and working position (b) 
 
The kinematic scheme of the mechanism used for this mechanical jack (fig. 5a) symbolises a 
hexagonal contour of articulated bars, two circular gears (segments) and a motion screw 1 as the 
driving element.

Fig. 5. Kinematic scheme of the mechanism - real (a), equivalent (b) and kinematic chain (c) 
 
To obtain the equivalent mechanism (fig. 5b) we equate each cylindrical gear: gear (6,7) with a 
bar-type kinematic element e67 and two articulations C' and D', and the gear (4, 5) with fictive bar 
e45 and the articulations A' and B'.  
Fictive bar e45 forms with bar 0 and bars 4 and 5 a second tetradic chain (4, 5, 0, e45) symmetrical 
to the other with respect to the screw axis 1.  
Thus, the lifting mechanism results from a hexagonal kinematic chain achieved by means of the 
symmetrical connection of the two tetradic chains (fig. 5c), when the potential articulations A and B 
become active. 
Following the kinematic scheme of the mechanism (fig. 5a) we identify an articulated hexagonal 
contour

This result proves the fact that there is a single driving element – screw 1, which, by means of 
rotation, transmits the motion of all the elements including bar 8.

The new screw-jack mechanism with articulated bars 
According to the kinematic scheme of the jack-screw with articulated bars (fig. 6), this is 
manually driven with the help of a screw provided with a lever.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                  Fig. 6. New kinematic scheme of the screw-jack with articulated bars 
 
The topological structure of the mechanism (fig. 6) is complex, highlighting a hexagonal contour 
of articulated bars in a vertical plane with double concavity.  
The articulated plane kinematic chain (0,5,9,10,7,4) is a concave hexagon A0ADCBB0  
consolidated by means of 6 bars (to the lower side) and 8 bars (to the upper side). 
Both lower bars (4, 5, 6) as well as upper bars (7, 8, 9) move in vertical parallel planes. The 
geometrical configuration of the concave hexagonal mechanism (fig. 6) supposes the equality of 
bars 4, 5, 7 and 9. Bars 6 and 8 have an equal length, so that the quadrangle AFBE (fig. 6) forms an 
articulated plane parallelogram.

Topological structure and calculation of the new mechanism mobility 
The mechanical jack mechanism (fig. 7a) consists of two kinematic chains, of which an open 
kinematic chain (1,2,3), with potential articulations A and B (fig. 7c) and another closed chain (fig. 
7b), made up of seven mobile kinematic elements (4,5, ... ,9,10) assembled in a complex topological 
structure with articulated bars, including the fixed element 0.

Fig. 7. Kinematic scheme of the mechanism (a) and the component kinematic chains (b, c) 
 
The closed kinematic chain (fig. 7b) has three independent plane contours with articulated bars: 
the hexagon (0,4,7,10,9,5), the quadrangle (0,4,6,5) and the parallelogram (5,6,7,8). The open 
kinematic chain (fig. 7c) consists of screw 1 connected to patina 2 through a rotation coupling and 
to the patina-nut 3 through the rotation-translation coupling. 
The two kinematic chains are assembled by means of the two potential articulations A and B, 
and then they become triple articulations (fig. 7a). It can be proved that, by the rotation of the 
motion screw 1, the hexagonal type closed kinematic chain moves all the component bars in a 
univocally determined way, of which the vertical motion of bar 10 is of interest. 
 
Static analysis of the new mechanism  
 
The screw lever jack mechanism works slowly, at a very small speed, and there are no 
accelerations. That is why accelerations will be further on neglected. Thus, the kinetic static 
calculus is reduced to static calculus. The calculus of the reactions in the kinematic couplings of the 
mechanism is considered, as well as the driving coupling necessary to counter the load, in terms of 
an effective technological resistance force (represented by the gravity force of the elevated table 
plane). The kinematic scheme of the lifting mechanism is considered (fig. 8), and the effective 
resistance force acting as a concentrated force on bar 10 is highlighted. 
In order to determine the static reactions, each kinematic element is considered with the gravity 
force acting in the mass centre as a concentrated force.

During the first stage of calculating the reactions, the dyadic chain (9, 10) is considered. This is a 
static determined structure. This dyadic chain is isolated (fig. 9a) by uncoupling from elements 2 
and 7, when the articulations (2, 9) and (7, 10) remain half articulations, also called potential 
articulations obtained by disconnection from the system [1].  
In the exterior articulations A and C (fig. 9a), we introduce the orthogonal components 
corresponding to the reaction of the elements from which they were separated: A(

B(

). In the inner articulation (active) D (between elements 9 and 10) we introduce both 
orthogonal components corresponding to the action from 10 towards 9 (

) with a minus. The known exterior forces are the main effective 
resistance force

 and the gravity forces corresponding to elements 9 (
9
G ) and 10 (
10
G ). 
The six components (two in each articulation) are unknown, and they can be calculated from the 
static balance equations of each kinematic element. The dyadic chain is a determined static system 
[1] as six static balance equations can be written for the six unknown values mentioned above. 
Thus, for bars 9 and 10, the two equations of projections and the torque one are:

The six linear equations (6), ... ,(11) form a system of six unknown values, which stand for the 
components of reactions in articulations A, C and D. 
In stage II, the dyadic chain LD(7,8) of the RRR type (fig. 9b) is isolated. It has the potential 
articulations A(2,8) and B(3,7), and the inner articulation F(7,8). For the two bars 7 and 8, the three 
static balance equations are written just like in stage I. 
In stage III, the mechanism formed by the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 is considered, which is left 
after removing the two dyadic chains (fig. 9). In points A and B, the components of the previously

B. When analysing the topological structure of this new spatial mechanism (fig. 8), no dyadic or 
triadic chain is identified. That is why, during this stage, each kinematic element of the mechanism 
is isolated, and three scalar equations are written for each of the bars 4, 5, 6 and the screw 1, while 
for skids 2 and 3, two scalar equations are written.    
 
Conclusions 
The structural topological analysis of mechanisms used in mechanical jacks has been concluded 
by deducing the structural formula for each independent kinematic contour and for the entire 
mechanism. To determine the mobility of such mechanisms, we have used generally valid formulas, 
checking that this allows univocal transmission of the driving element’s motion to the driven 
element. Considering all the things above, it results that the drive element, the one onto which the 
driving mechanism is attached, does a rotation motion, while the driven element does a translation 
motion. The static calculus of the new mechanism can be done in three stages. The first two stages 
refer to the upper kinematic chain (above screw 1), while the third stage refers to the lower 
kinematic chain.

Abstract. Now, worldwide, the Lean Manufacturing system represents the most comprehensive 
management philosophy within a manufacturing process. One of the basic principles of Lean 
Manufacturing is 5S process which involves the risks and wastes eliminating and it is considered a 
key of worker and equipment’s safety.  Therefore, during the last years, 5S was expanded to 6S by 
the Safety adding. Thus, in this paper aspects about 6S process implementation on a manufacturing 
company of automotive components is presented. The monthly implementation extent of each 6S 
process indicators from 2013 until now is described, especially on the production lines of the 
factory. Finally, the major benefits of the introduction of the 6S principles in the company are 
highlighted. 
Introduction 
Soon after the end of the Second World War, in the early 50’s, in Japan,  Eiji Toyoda brought in 
the concept of continuous production flow and Taiichi Ohno, in 1960, introduced the concept of 
Toyota Production System (TPS) [1] which later became in the USA in the early 90’s, Lean 
Manufacturing [2]. As it is well known the series production has evolved so much in all areas, so 
that after the 1980’s the value of products for the customer was given by low costs, the availability 
of products with high quality and flexibility of producers to manufacture according to market 
requirements [3]. After 2000, the value of the products for the customer is given by the flexibility of 
production, high quality and low costs associated with products availability [4]. Now, Lean 
Manufacturing (or simply “Lean”) represents the most important system production improvement 
consisting of a set of principles and tools, which can be applied in any field of manufacturing, but 
especially in the automotive industry [5].  Lean relies on the Toyota production system and is 
adapted by Womack and Jones in 1995 for Western companies, referring to the real basic 
capabilities [6]. Lean Manufacturing or production at minimal costs is a philosophy which reduces 
the production time from customer order until product shipment by identification and steady 
elimination of the wastes [7]. Lean is a management system, a philosophy or set of tools, depending 
on the scale and level of development strategy and culture of the organization as they apply [8].  
Eliminating or reducing the wastes shall be made specifically according to the various tools 
required for a specific place and appropriate timing [9]. All Lean tools have emerged as a result of 
practical solutions found by certain people in certain situations and at certain times. Thus, 
empiricism and specificity makes them almost impossible to use as they were described by their 
creators [10]. Furthermore, similar methods have emerged and have been described by different 
names, although literature seems to have many tools, but often it comes developments or changes in 
better practices are encountered in many places and by many names [11]. In Fig.1 some of the most 
popular methods and instruments used for lean implementing are shown.

Fig.1. Tools Lean 
According to Fig.1, among the most used methods and instruments applied to implement lean in 
a company are mentioned: Value stream mapping, Visual Factory, 5S, Total Productive 
Maintenance (TPM), Standardized work, Kanban, Error Proofing or Poka-Yoke, Quick Changeover, 
Just in Time (JIT), Six Sigma, Kaizen and so on [12]. 
The most common approaches used by the companies on their first stages towards transforming 
their organization into one Leaner are the Value stream mapping (VSM) and 5S tools. 
One of the basic tool used in Lean implementation is 5S Process (Sort, Set, Shine, Standardize, 
Sustain) or simply 5S, a concept that is considered the foundation of Lean implementing in a 
company.  This concept represents a structured program which allow to develop discipline, 
eliminate waste, set a standard, etc. [13]. Thus, a well-organized workplace is safer, more efficient 
and more productive [14]. Implementation of 5S principles involves reducing and eliminating risks 
and wastes being a key of worker safety which are decisive elements in world-class competitiveness 
[15]. For this reason, in recent years, 5S was expanded to 6S by the addition of “safety”, Fig.2 [16].  
  The purpose of this study is to present the manner of 6S method implementation on a company 
that produce automotive components.

Implementing of 6S Process in a company 
This study has been undertaken on an enterprise which is supplying automotive components for 
two internationals automobile companies, Ford and Fiat. The implementing of 6S process has been 
carried out beginning with 2013 until now. During this period, six areas within the company have 
been monitored continuously, designated as: 1 for Ford line zone; 2 for Fiat line area; 3 for logistics 
zone; 4 for external sector, 5 for quality laboratory and maintenance and 6 for offices and the 
canteen. The evaluation of 6S implementing consisted in monthly monitoring by scoring with notes 
between 1 and 5 of the achievement of each progress indicator. The following table illustrates the 
grading mode for each indicator of 6S method. The determinations were carried out according to 
American standards for Lean quality.

 As reflected from Table 1, the maximum value that can be obtained for each index of the 6S 
process is 5, which means that by cumulating the notes, the maximum value that can be obtained 
regarding the 6S implementation is 20 per month. Thus, monthly, 100% actions for 6S 
implementation means 120 points overall score for the 6 indicators (Sort, Set, Shine, Standardize, 
Sustain, Safety).  
In Fig.3 the chart that illustrates the extent of compliance with the 6S process in the enterprise for 
Ford and Fiat lines zones for the year 2013 is presented. 
Fig.3. The implementation percentages of 6S process for production areas for 2013 
 
From the Fig.3 it can be noticed that the percentage of 6S process implementation for the 
productive areas increased from 60% to 80% in the last quarter of 2013.  
Further, in Fig.4 the implementation percentages of 6S process for the 3,4,5 and 6 areas at the 
provider automotive components factory for the year 2013 are shown. 
Fig.4. The 6S process implementation for logistics, quality and offices areas for 2013  
 
Also, it is specified that the causes which led to the decrease of the 6S implementation indices in 
May, June, July and August in zones shown in Fig.4 were due to change the enterprise layout 
(equipment’s setup, storage and offices areas and productive activities development), thus passed 
from 6 zones verification only a 2 areas auditing: 1 for Ford line zone; 2 for Fiat line area. Thus, it 
has amended the method of audit, which resulted, in the first phase, of the lack of standards and 
then, the failure to comply of the 6S standards in those periods. Still, it is ascertained from Fig. 4 
that the percentage of 6S process implementation has increased from 60% to about 85% in 2013 for 
the areas of logistics, quality and offices.

the year 2014 is presented.

In Fig.5 on the abscissa appears the abbreviation YTD which relate to the means average of the 
percentages of 6S process implementation during the year 2013 which has been considered as the 
starting point for 2014. From Fig.5 it can be observed that the target of the 6S process 
implementation for the year 2014 submitted an ascending slope, increasing from 70% for the 2013 
YTD to over 90% at the end of 2014. Also, the 6S process implementation in provider automotive 
components factory continued in 2015. Thus, in the next figures the implementation score for each 
6S process indicator for Ford and Fiat line zone, for the month of June 2015 are given.

 indicators on June 2015 for Ford line zone               indicators on June 2015 for Fiat line zone 
 
As it has been presented in Table 1, the monthly level notation of compliance for each 6S process 
indicator was achieved with notes between 1 and 5. Thus, 20 represents the maximum value of 
monthly scoring implementation for each 6S process indicator that can be obtained. 
From the Figs. 6 and 7 can be observed that for all 6S process indicators (Safety, Sort, Straighten, 
Shine, and Standardize) they have achieved greater values than 4. This means a high degree of 
reaching of 6S process application over 90% for each indicator, for the month May 2015 for both 
production lines Ford and Fiat of the automotive component suppliers’ factory. It can be considered 
that 6S process has been successfully implemented in the company.

Conclusions 
This study provided important aspects of one of the basic principles of Lean implementation, the 
6S process, in a manufacturing company of automotive components. The introduction of 6S process 
started in 2013 and was carried out during the following years, with monitoring of progress of each 
of the six indicators of the 6S process (Safety, Sort, Straighten, Shine, and Standardize) and taking 
corrective measures subsequently the problems that occurred.  
After the implementation of 6S process on both production lines for Ford and Fiat were found 
noticeable improvements, such as: firstly, the greatly increasing of workers and machines Safety, as 
well as enhancing the equipment efficiency due to their stationary time decreasing, and, also, 
productive maintenance has been significantly improved.

Keyords: air-fuel mixture, pollutant emissions, oxygen sensor, output voltage, simulated fault, 
indicial response 
Abstract. Flow corrections established based on Lambda control system of spark ignition engines, 
determines in a decisively way the quality of air-fuel mixture. Faults in the operation of the control 
system generates deviations of the mixture composition from stoichiometric report, in this way 
affecting the entire combustion process in engine cylinders. This phenomenon leads, among others, 
to changes regarding the density of pollutant emissions from exhaust gases. In this context, this 
paper presents experimental researches made using the simulation of faults that may occur in the 
control system to highlight their influence on the concentration of engine emissions. 
Introduction 
Lambda control system existing on the spark ignition engines are currently the most effective 
method of reducing exhaust emissions. The role of this system is to ensure the operation of the 
engine with mixtures close to the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (λ=1,00), thaking into account that in 
this field are obtained the smallest amounts of pollutants (Fig. 1): reduction of  carbon monoxide 
and hydrocarbons to 99% and nitrogen oxides up to 92-98%. This very small area, located between 
the limits λ=0,99 and λ=1,01 is called Lambda control area (Fig. 1). [4]

- electronic control unit of engine (ECUengine), which based on the informations received from 
oxygen sensor (Uλ), establishes the flow corrections necessary for keeping the air-fuel report within 
the Lambda control area; 
- unit of the forming mixture (injection system), which, receiving the correction signal of flow (UC)  
form ECUengine, changes accordingly the amount of fuel injected into engine cylinders.

closed-loop mixture control [6]: 
1 – injector; 
2 – ECUengine; 
3 – oxygen sensor; 
4 – catalyst; 
Uλ – sensor output voltage; 
UC – control voltage injection. 
Any malfunction in the operation control system makes it impossible to maintain air-fuel mixture 
inside the Lambda control area, changing the development of the entire process of combustion from 
the engine cylinders. This phenomena has an impact on functional and performance parameters of 
engine and, therefore, also on the density of emissions from the combustion gases. 
Faults typology 
Faults that may occur in the Lambda control system can be grouped into two broad categories:  
1. lack of flow corrections which may arise due to causes such as: 
- damages of the oxygen sensor, determined by changes in electrochemical properties of sensor 
electrodes that may occur in time, manifests by reducing the affinity of their active material (slow 
response) compared to oxygen ions in the exhaust gases; 
- faults of the oxygen sensor circuit connection – ECUengine – injector actuator: open circuit, 
imperfect contact, short circuit between conductors or circuit to ground; 
- faults of the ECUengine, due to software errors or hardware physical damage; 
2. delay of correction flow, which can be determined by the following reasons: 
- faults of the oxygen sensor, determined by changes in electrochemical properties of sensor 
electrodes that may occur in time, manifests by lack of response given by their active material 
compared to oxygen ions in the exhaust gases; 
- faults of the ECUengine, due to software errors. 
Experimental researches 
To emphasize the influence of the faults of the Lambda control system over the concentrations of 
engine exhaust emissions, the simulation of them was used within experimental samples. In this 
aim, at the pair connector of the oxygen sensor is coupled a signal generator (Fig. 3) which will 
transfer a voltage of a certain value to the ECUengine. In this way, ECUengine will consider that the 
voltage received from the signal generator comes from the oxygen sensor and that the latter presents 
a fault. 
The experimental tests has been performed on a Renault K4M engine having the fallowing 
characteristics: type of the fuel supply – fuel injection; no. of cylinder – 4 in line; displacement – 
1598 cc ; nominal power – 82 kW (110 HP) at 6000 rot/min; maximum torque – 145 Nm at 4250 
rot/min; emissions standard – Euro 3.

During the experimental tests has been used the following equipments: 
-  Renault Clip v10.2 diagnostic application for monitoring and recording parameters that 
characterize the operation of the engine; 
-  SUN MGA1500 exhaust gas analyzer used for measurement of engine emissions; 
-  Tektronix AFG3102 arbitrary function generator used for sensor fault simulation. 
The recording of the monitored parameters using Clip diagnosis application is developed in 
specific format documents, DAT type. This is the reason why was elaborated an executable 
conversion program edited in Clojure programming language that runs on Java Virtual Machine. 
This program converts files in CSV format, which allows their import into Matlab for visualization 
and further processing.

There had been performed 4 experimental tests, one of them in the absence of faults (PO – 
normal functioning of the engine). The other ones took place in the presence of a three simulated 
faults (P1 ÷ P3). The following parameters that characterize the operation of the engine being 
monitored: 
- the engine speed; 
- output voltage of oxygen sensor (Uλ); 
- enrichment correction (Qcor); 
- instant fuel consumption; 
- fuel injection duration (tinj); 
- concentration of pollutant emissions from engine exhaust gases (HC, CO).

Unburned hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) are the main pollutants emitted by 
spark ignition engines, such as the one prepared in this paper. 
P1 fault – A fault simulation represented by the lack of flow corrections, which corresponds to 
an output voltage of oxygen sensor with a constant value Uλ=195mV (Fig. 4). 
Value Uλ=195mV of voltage transmitted by the oxygen sensor to ECUengine corresponds to an air-
fuel report located in the lean mixture area (λ>1,00), this value being maintained constant. 
Therefore, ECUengine will work continuously for the purposes of enriching the mixture with a 
constant flow correction, caused by lack of oscillations of voltage sent to ECUengine. Experimentally, 
during test P1, it was determined a flow correction value higher the average value of this parameter 
recorded in the absence of fault (Fig. 6). This increases the duration of injection (Fig. 5). Running 
the engine with mixtures richer than the real conditions would require determines a sharp increase 
of pollutant emissions (HC and CO) from exhaust gases (Table 1).

P2 fault – a fault simulation represented by the lack of flow corrections, which corresponds to an 
output voltage of oxygen sensor, with a constant value  Uλ=595mV (Fig. 4). 
Value Uλ=595mV of voltage transmitted by the oxygen sensor to ECUengine corresponds to an air-
fuel report located in the rich mixture area (λ<1,00), this value being maintained constant. 
Therefore, ECUengine will work continuously for the purposes of the impoverishment of mixture, 
phenomenon observed experimentally based to the fact that flow correction value during P2 sample 
was lower than the average value of this parameter recorded in the absence of fault (Fig. 6). 
However, although the simulated voltage doesn’t have variations, ECUengine acts through flow 
corrections in the sense of increasing fuel to prevent an irregular operation of the engine caused by 
the existence of an excessive small amount of fuel injected. 
As a result of the of the two contradictory trends ordered by ECUengine, duration of injection 
shows significant oscillations (Fig. 5), while concentrations of pollutants (HC and CO) in exhaust 
gases (Table 1) show a slight increase.

P3 fault – a fault simulation consisting of delay correction flow, which corresponds to an output 
voltage of oxygen sensor with sinusoidal oscillations with frequency f=0,3Hz and variation 
Uλ=100÷700mV (Fig. 4). 
Analysis of how this type of fault affects the quality of the air- fuels mixture is done by 
determining the sensor response time. For this purpose, it is analyzed sensor indicial response, 
considering sensor as an inertial element of order I. Therefore, oxygen sensor operation is described 
through a differential equation of order I. [2] 
 
Fig. 7. Indicial response of the oxygen sensor 
Based on the records made during the experimental samples with Matlab program [1], is drawn 
the indicative response corresponding to the two operational situations: lack of fault and also, in the 
presence of fault P3 (Fig. 7). Analyzing the two curves, it can be observed: 
- sensor response time in the absence of faults: tr0=0,2s; 
- sensor response time in the presence of P3 fault: tr3=0,25s. 
Therefore, the increase of sensor inertia to changes in oxygen concentration in the exhaust gases 
caused by the presence of P3 fault, lead to an increase in sensor response time by 25% compared to 
normal operating situation. 
Increase of sensor response time determines a delay in flow correction ordered by ECUengine 
through Lambda control system (Fig. 6), leading to the increase of the injection duration (Fig. 5). 
This is why, even if the simulated voltage corresponds to values of the excess air coefficient located 
within the area of Lambda control, phenomena described above generates the increase of 
concentration of pollutants (HC and CO) from exhaust gases (Table 1). 
Conclusions 
Considering the experiments performed, it was determined that the Lambda control system, 
based on the functional role that it has in the process of formation of air-fuel mixture, has a 
significantly influence on the functional and performance parameters of the engine. 
Depending on how far the fuel air mixture composition is comparing with the stoichiometric 
report, the effects of control system failures on engine operation, might take the shape of: increase 
in exhaust emissions, increased fuel consumption, uneven engine operation (even with a tendency 
to stop due to the existence of a mixture excessively rich or poor). Also, the malfunctioning of 
oxygen sensor (part of control system) can have negative effects also regarding the normal 
functioning of the catalytic converter. 
Therefore, the effects described can be grouped into two categories: 
- minor effects, although they change the values of a characteristic parameters, the engine remains 
still functional; 
- critical effects, affecting the proper functioning of the engine in a noticeably way.

Abstract. The demand of petroleum fuels which affect the air quality requires the use of alternative 
fuels to decrease the harmful emissions. In all the countries of European Union the biofuel 
production is stimulated and is a prime political and economic goal. The aim of this research is to 
evaluate the possibility to use biodiesel of palm oil in diesel engines with special emphasis on CO, 
CO2, HC and O2 emissions. Various blends of diesel and biodiesel of palm oil were mixed and 
evaluated on an experimental engine stand developed in the laboratory.  
Introduction 
Since the industrialization various forms of energy were used to maintain a certain standard of 
living and to increase the economic growth. To fulfill the energy demand in the last century were 
used fossil fuels, liquid fuels derived from petroleum, natural gas and coal. Due to the facts that 
aren’t renewable these natural resources are projected to be exhausted. The increase of world 
population combined with energy demand requires the use of others resources [1]. The policy of 
European Union established by the Environment Committee of the European Parliament demands a 
reduction by 20% of greenhouse gas emissions compared to the 1990 values [2, 3]. Biodiesel is the 
first choice as renewable diesel fuels for car manufactures with a minimum effect on greenhouse 
gases due to the participation in the natural circuit of CO2 and reduction on smoke emissions.  
Biodiesel which have a density closed to mineral diesel can be mixed in any proportions and used in 
diesel engine without prior modifications. However biodiesel must respect technical specifications 
specified in the EN 14214 and ASTM D6751 standards [4]. Biodiesel was analyzed and researchers 
found in their experiments that produces low unregulated and regulated emissions. Also the research 
in the use of non edible oils used for biodiesel is more promising than the edible oils [5, 6]. Palash 
et al. [7] in their studies noticed that the use of biodiesel and its blends can reduce the CO, PM, and 
HC emissions but increase the NOx. Di et al. use in their researches ultra-low sulfur petroleum fuel 
mixed with biodiesel from different waste cooking oil. Was found that biodiesel blends in four 
cylinder diesel engine reduce the emission PM (particulate matter), CO, HC, formaldehyde, xylene 
and toluene, but increased the emissions of acetaldehyde [8, 9]. Major decrease in the emissions of 
carbon, particulate matter, and unburned hydrocarbons with the increase in NOx and brake-specific 
fuel consumption was found by Bhupendra et al [10]. Comparing the calorific value 
of biodiesel with mineral diesel, 1 litre of biodiesel is the equivalent of 0.91 liters diesel fuel which 
leads to a higher consumption of biodiesel by 5%. The previous experiments show that biodiesel 
help to a better engine lubrication and to a low wear of cylinders and piston. The literature mentions 
that compared with petroleum diesel, biodiesel efficiency is with 6.5% higher. Previous research on

been found as potential non edible oil for biodiesel use. The palm oil is the most used oil in the 
world particularly in many food preparations especially for its low cost of production. The total 
yield per hectare in the case of palm oil is is ten times higher than in soyabean, sunflower or 
rapeseed. Indonesia and Malaysia concentrates 86% of world palm oil production. The biodiesel of 
palm oil can be used in our country especially in summer months when the temperature is over 15°C 
and his viscosity and density is closed to mineral diesel. 
 Biodiesel from palm oil was obtaining through a process of transesterification and the main 
physico-chemical properties were measured in accordance with known biodiesel standards. In this 
paper different blends of biodiesel of palm oil and diesel are analyzed to observe the performance, 
emissions and combustion characteristics. 
Methods and materials 
For the experiments a KM186FA single cylinder, air cooled, direct injection was selected which 
is used for household electricity generations and in agriculture sector. All the engine technical 
specifications are given in Table 1. The experimental setup schematic diagram along with all 
instrumentation is presented in Fig. 1. Stargas 898 Gas Analyzer was used for the measurements of 
various exhaust gas emissions. For the test was used a gas analyzer STARGAS 898 which measure 
different combustion gases: (CO – monoxide of carbon; 0 ÷15,000 % Vol.; CO2 – dioxide of 
carbon; 0 ÷20, 00 % Vol.; HC – unburned hydrocarbons; 0 ÷30000 p.p.m. Vol.; O2 – oxygen; 
0 ÷25, 00 % Vol.;), temperature of oil of the engine and the speed of crankshaft. For the 
measurement of the speed at the crankshaft of the engine we use a digital tachometer DT-2234C. 
 The diesel engine was first started with normal diesel fuel and allowed to run for 1 hour until the 
steady state was reached. Various blends were mixed by using two way valves. Each blend is 
evaluated for five tests to eliminate the inconclusive data. The biodiesel and diesel main properties 
are investigated in Table 2. The studies are conducted for variables loads like 0.13, 0.40, 0.67, 1, 
1.5, 2, 2.6, and 3.3 at rated speed [11].

Results and discussion 
The presence of monoxide of carbon in the combustion products is due to the incomplete 
combustion. Emissions are affected by the fuel type, combustion chamber shape, and rate of 
atomization, air–fuel ratio and engine speed. Within the all experimental range the CO emission 
from the methyl ester of palm oil and its blends decrease in comparison with neat diesel fuel (Fig.2). 
The CO reduction is possible due to presence of oxygen in biodiesel fuel that enhances a complete 
combustion and as such carbon monoxide is converted in to carbon dioxide.

CO2 from the engine performance point of view is an indicator how the engine can perform and 
achieve complete combustion. More CO2 emissions released means closer to complete combustions 
of fuels. In the range of whole engine load, the emissions of CO2 of diesel fuel are lower than that of 
biodiesel of palm oil and its blended fuels. This is because biodiesel and its blends contain more 
oxygen element, which results in better combustion. CO2 emissions increase as the proportion of 
biodiesel increase in the blend (Fig.3). The highest CO2 emissions have been noticed in case of 
biodiesel of palm oil. From the data collected it can be observed a reduction of HC emissions due to 
the fact that has no aromatic compounds like diesel fuel (Fig.4). Biodiesel has small final distillation 
points than diesel; the final fraction of the diesel may not completely vaporize and burn, rising HC 
emissions. Hydrocarbons emissions are in general caused due to the incomplete combustion of 
hydrocarbon fuel. Also oxygen content is higher in the case of biodiesel blends (Fig. 5) due to the 
higher oxygen content in biodiesel.

Results and discussion 
The present study was carried out in a mono cylindrical diesel engine with the main objective to 
evaluate the suitability of biodiesel from palm oil and various blend either as a fuel for Diesel 
engine. The data collected in the experiments show that engine performance and emissions when is 
fueled with palm biodiesel and its blends were comparable with diesel fuel. Fuel properties can be 
enhanced by blending two or more different fuels. The use of palm oil as biodiesel fuel can be an 
alternative for mineral diesel as long it can be purchased on a low price.

Abstract. The internal combustion engine that equips a vehicle is a complex assembly of 
mechanical parts and electronics that controls almost every system. The electronic part of the 
vehicle gives the opportunity to observe and control what happens with the engine during function. 
The present paper follows the evolution of the pollutant emissions in relation with some transitory 
regimes of the car.       
Introduction 
A very high percent of today‘s vehicles used in transportation have the fuel based on oil, that 
resource of the world that it is limited and which results of the burning process are considered to be 
the main source of pollution. Having as a priority the reducing of pollution as much as possible, 
every car manufacturer and researcher is in a continue development of solutions for improvement of 
their engines and related products. 
The worldwide community considered that a solution to reduce the pollutant emissions due the 
automotive industry and especially the level of CO2 is to establish some regulations regarding the 
values of pollutants produced by a new car exhaust gases to be limited and at every 4 or 5 years to 
ask for a limit that has to be respected by the engine manufacturers [1]. 
This rule comes with changes also for the fuel used for these engines, so the oil products must 
be in accordance with the regulations. 
These changes regarding the fuel regulations will have an impact over the past engines 
manufactured and due to the fact that not every owner of a vehicle is able to change his car so that 
he can obey to the regulations and he must use the new fuel existing on the market. A new engine is 
manufactured also with considerations over the performance regarding an increased amount of 
power which can be obtained with a higher compression rate. One major aspect of the fuel is the 
octane number which represents the behavior of the fuel in engines with high compression rates 
without detonating and threatening the safety of the car and passengers [2].  
The following tests will be made on an Opel Corsa C, hatchback, 3 doors, manufactured in year 
2001, with a mileage of 152000 km. 
Devices and software 
OBD. On-board diagnostics (OBD) is an automotive term that refers to a vehicle's self-diagnostic 
and reporting capability. OBD systems give to the repair technician or vehicle owner access to the 
status of the various vehicle modules. The amount of data available via OBD is varied, depending 
on the automobile level of technology. In the early versions of OBD the fault was reported by the 
illumination of a malfunction indicator light.

This versions does not provide any information about the problem found, it only indicate that 
something does not work properly. The latest version of OBD use a standardized digital 
communications port in order to provide real-time data that can be analyzed, not only a standardized 
series of diagnostic trouble codes, or DTCs, which allow to quickly identify and remedy 
malfunctions within the vehicle. 
OBD-II is a new, improved, diagnostics protocol, which is over OBD-I in both standardization 
and capability. A major improvement is that there is o pin in the port which provide power to the 
scanning tool, from the automobile battery. This eliminates the dependency of a separately power 
source [3, 4]. 
OBD-II provides a large and extensible list of DTCs. Diagnostic Trouble Codes is 4-digit, 
preceded by a letter: P (powertrain), B (body), C (chassis), and U (network) [3].

Results and discussion  
Testing is the experimental determination of parameters in order to establish the technical and / 
or performance of parts, subassemblies, assemblies, equipment or technical systems. 
Most often determination of the exact values of the state parameters are not possible, which 
makes it difficult to determine sensitive operations or technical status. It must therefore resort to a 
process for determining the technical condition of the machines indirect operating with other sizes, 
dependent in some kind of state parameters, and measurable. The value of these parameters, called 
diagnostic parameters, are the quantitative expression of the external act of mutations occurring in 
the machine assembly structure and therefore change its state parameters.

Conclusion  
Nowadays people cannot afford to buy a new car that satisfy the new regulations regarding the 
emissions levels asked by the authorities, many of them are still using vehicles that where 
manufactured over 10 years ago. 
Back, the emission level had other values and also the main factor on which the transportation 
relies, the fuel for the thermal engines was produced accordingly to the laws. In time the rules 
changed and also the engines and the new products demanded a new fuel based on the needs so the 
old ones had to use the type of fuel existing now.  
Using the data acquisition through OBD, the Electronic Control Module (ECU) of the car 
provides a large amount of data. This method is generally used for reading Diagnostic Trouble 
Codes (DTC), although accurate real-time data can be recorded. The provided real-time data can be 
used for complex analysis.  
There can be observed dependencies such as: variation of the engine speed in time, variation of 
the air flow in time, variation of the air-fuel mixture in time, according to the O2 sensors, variation 
of the vehicle speed in time, the increase of the engine temperature in time, the relation between 
engine speed and the increase of the engine temperature.

Abstract. The objective of this study is to simulate the compression stroke in diesel engines by 
using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and to model the compression stroke by using 
thermodynamic equations for Ideal gases and polynomial function that fits thermodynamic data of 
JANAF tables. The most important parameters to be simulated and modeled during the compression 
stroke are temperature and pressure of cylinder gases because of their important effects on mixture 
formation inside the engine combustion chamber. The simulation part will be performed using 
ANSYS ICE software. The modeling part will be performed using a MATLAB program composed 
by the corresponding author. Simulation and modeling process will be carried out between the 
intake valve close (IVC) and top dead center (TDC), the results of simulation and modeling will be 
compared and discussed. 
Introduction 
The simulation and modeling of the cylinder gases parameters at beginning of the injection is 
considered the main advantage of this study. The calculation of cylinder gases parameters at 
beginning of the injection helps to predict and control gases emissions [1,2], these gases are 
considered the main concern of diesel engine developers nowadays due to their impacts on climate 
change and global warming. There are many studies and methods that carried out and developed for 
modeling engine cycle including the compression stroke. All of these studies and methods are based 
on several assumptions such as the consideration of cylinder gases as ideal gases, the uniform 
distribution of temperature and pressure inside the engine cylinder, and the assumption of cylinder 
gases composition is a frozen composition [3]. Recently and after the revolution of using 
computational fluid dynamics method for simulating internal combustion engines, it is possible to 
include other parameters in studying the compression stroke such as the turbulence, and the heat 
transfer between cylinder walls and cylinder gases, which gives us better understanding to 
compression stroke, and helps us to enhance the next processes that occur in diesel engines such as 
the mixture formation process and ignition delay period. 
Modeling of Compression Stroke 
The main problem which faces us in the modeling process is the variable heat transfer between 
the cylinder charge and the cylinder walls, Heat transfer occurs from cylinder walls to fresh air 
charge at the first stage of compression stroke, with more compression at a certain point the 
cylinder charge temperature becomes higher than the cylinder wall temperature and the heat transfer 
occurs from the cylinder charge to cylinder wall. Hence, the polytropic exponent of real 
compression process changes its value during the compression stroke and determining the value of 
this exponent at every crank angle is necessary for calculating the cylinder gases temperature and 
pressure. In order to overcome this problem each crank angle will be divided into 10 isentropic 
steps and every step has its own isentropic exponent. The compression process starts from intake 
valve close (IVC) till the top dead center (TDC). For more information about modeling the 
compression stroke [4,5]

On the other hand the temperature of the cylinder charge at the end of the intake stroke is higher 
than the atmospheric temperature due to the effect of high temperature of residual gases and due to 
the heat transfer between the cylinder wall and the inducted air, which leads to increase the 
temperature of cylinder gases. The temperature of cylinder gases at the beginning of compression 
stroke is calculated by using Eq. 2.

The number of moles for each kind of cylinder gases is determined according to the cylinder 
volume, the volumetric efficiency, residual gases coefficient, and the mole fraction for constituents 
of atmospheric air. The mole fraction for principle constituents of dry atmospheric air are 78.08% 
for Nitrogen, 20.95% for Oxygen, and 0.031% for carbon dioxide [6]. The mole fraction of water 
vapor can be calculated according to the measured atmospheric temperature and the measured 
humidity.

Simulation of Compression Stroke 
The simulation and modeling were performed on naturally aspirated four stroke diesel engine at 
2400 rpm, the engine stroke is 115 mm, engine bore is 107 mm, and the compression ratio is 17.5. 
The simulation process passes through several steps, the first step is ICE Setup during this step the 
engine speed and dimensions should be entered. The next step is Geometry Setup, at this step the 
combustion chamber sector is created by ANSYS DESIGN MODELER as it can be seen in Fig. 1 
section (a). The third step is Mesh which it can be seen in Fig. 1 section (b), the mesh was generated 
automatically by using ANSYS ICEM program. Then more parameters such as the temperature of 
combustion chamber walls and the composition of in-cylinder gases should be entered at the forth 
step which is called ICE Solver Setup. The solution is calculated at fifth step by using FLUENT 
program. After calculating the solution, it should be updated and saved in order to show the figures 
and other simulation data.

It should be mentioned that the percentage of cylinder gases should be entered as a parentage by 
mass not by volume as it can be seen in table 1. The difference between the composition of cylinder 
gases and the composition of atmospheric air is attributed to the residual gases that remain in the 
combustion chamber from the previous combustion cycle. The duration of simulation depends on 
CPU properties and it takes 14 hours to calculate the solution by using processor Intel(R) Core(TM) 
2 Duo.

Results and Discussion 
Fig. 2 and 3 show the change of cylinder gases temperature at different crank angles, 
Fig. 2.section (a) shows the uniform distribution of temperature of cylinder gases at IVC, and 
because it considered the starting point of simulation process the effect of heat transfer between 
cylinder gases and cylinder walls cannot be distinguished at this early stage of compression, it can 
be seen in Fig. 2 section (b) and Fig. 3 section (a) the effect of heat transfer between cylinder walls 
and cylinder gases on the temperature of cylinder gases which located near to the cylinder walls, 
Fig. 2 section (b) represents the cylinder temperature at TDC.

Fig. 3 a Cylinder temperature (K) at 310 CAD, and b cylinder temperature (K) at TDC 
 
Fig. 4 illustrates the simulation and modeling results of cylinder temperature, it can be seen that 
the temperature of cylinder gases increases gradually from IVC till TDC. On the other hand 
regarding the cylinder pressure it can be seen in Fig. 5 that cylinder pressure increases slowly at the 
start of compression stroke, and then the rate of rise starts to get higher after 300 CAD. It can be 
seen after the 340 CAD the value of modeled results starts to get higher than the value of simulation 
results. The difference is attributed to the shortcoming in modeling process because it considers the 
compression process as isentropic process. Also the difference can be attributed to the decrease in 
accuracy of modeling method at high temperatures. The accepted range for using the coefficients of 
NASA program which were used in modeling process is between 300 K to 1000 K [7]. Hence, 
when the temperature of cylinder gases reaches high values of coefficients range, the accuracy starts 
decreasing. 
The temperature and pressure of cylinder reach their highest value at top dead center which is 
obvious in both the simulation and modeling results as it can be seen in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. The 
results of modeling and simulation of cylinder temperature are in good agreement, and the 
maximum deviation between the results of simulation and modeling of cylinder temperature at the 
top dead center does not exceed 1.8%, which considered a very satisfied result.

Conclusions 
Compression stroke was simulated by using CFD and modeled by using thermodynamic 
equations and polynomial function; the results were discussed and illustrated at different crank 
angles. After analyzing the results of simulation and modeling, it can be concluded that both 
methods are satisfied in terms of accuracy and they are in a good agreement. The simulation study 
allows showing more details about the temperature distribution of cylinder gases during the 
compression process. The time of calculation is one of the main factors that determine which 
method is preferable to use, since the modeling time is just milliseconds, whereas the simulation 
study is computationally expensive and it takes hours for calculating the results.

Keywords: CFD, eddy dissipation model, combustion, diesel engines. 
Abstract. The aim of this study is to simulate the combustion process in the combustion chamber of 
diesel engines by using eddy dissipation model (EDM) and computational fluid dynamics method 
(CFD). Computational fluid dynamics has been used wieldy in the recent years for simulating the 
strokes of diesel engines including the combustion process. Eddy dissipation model can be used for 
simulating non-premixed combustion cases such as the combustion in diesel engines. The 
simulation steps and the simulation results will be discussed and illustrated. ANSYS program is the 
software which used for performing this simulation. 
Introduction 
The new regulations of diesel engines emissions and the consumers’ demands on better fuel 
consumptions have been forcing the diesel engines companies and developers to meet these 
regulations and demands by enhancing the engine design and by improving the combustion process. 
Enhancing and improving the combustion process is considered a corner stone for reducing gas 
emissions and increasing the fuel efficiency. Hence, for the sake of enhancing the combustion 
process the computational fluid dynamics is used for diesel engine development which leads to 
reduce the costs and time of the engine developing process. 
The simulation of turbulent combustion in diesel engines imposes many difficulties such as the 
heterogeneous nature of the diesel-air mixture inside the combustion chamber, the turbulent flows 
inside the combustion chamber, and the chemical kinetics of chemical reactions between the 
components of cylinder gases [1,2]. ANSYS program includes several models that used for 
simulating the combustion process in diesel engines; one of these models is eddy dissipation model 
(EDM) which used to perform this study. 
Simulation Setup  
The simulation and the experiment were performed on 4 strokes direct injection diesel engine 
fueled by diesel at 1400 rpm, engine stroke is 118 mm, bore is 107mm, and compression ratio is 
17.5. ANSYS IC Engine program was used for the simulation. The simulation goes through 8 steps, 
ICE, Geometry, Mesh, ICE Solver Setup, Setup, Solution, and Results. Fig. 1 section (a) shows the 
result of step 2 which represents the decomposed geometry that obtained by decomposing the 
geometry of combustion chamber to one sector, the sector angle is determined according to the 
numbers of injector holes. In our study the holes number is 4. Hence, the sector angle is 90 degree. 
The decomposed geometry was meshed by ANSYS ICEM, and the mesh result can be seen in 
Fig. 1 section (b). 
It should be mentioned that the sub-models that used for performing the simulation are k-
epsilon for simulating the turbulence, KH-RT model for simulating the diesel injection process and 
Hardenberg model for modeling the ignition delay period, for more data about these models [3]. 
Eddy dissipation model (EDM) is based on the assumption of fast chemistry, whereas the 
mixing process controls the rate of reactions during the combustion, for more information about this 
model [4,5].

Results and Discussion 
The results of simulation process will be illustrated and discussed at different crack angles, the 
figures were chosen to illustrate the ignition delay period and the phases of combustion process in 
diesel engines. Fig. 2 section (a) shows the temperature inside the combustion chamber at 345 
CAD, it is obvious the difference in temperature between the injected diesel and the surrounding 
compressed hot cylinder gases. Also it can be noticed that this figure represents the ignition delay 
period since no combustion occurred yet. As mentioned before Hardenberg model was used for 
modeling the ignition delay period. 
Fig. 2 section (b), and Fig. 3 section (a) show the temperature inside the combustion chamber at 
358 CAD, and 362 CAD respectively. Both figures represent the combustion process, whereas it 
can be seen how the flame hits the piston bowl and how the flame front takes the shape of the bowl. 
It can be seen the gradual difference between the temperature of flame front and the temperature of 
cylinder gases. The flame front temperature reaches 2700 K [6], and as it can be noticed at 358 
CAD and 362 CAD the flame front temperature is close to 2700K, which is considered a satisfied 
result. Fig. 3 section (b) shows the decrease in the cylinder temperature; this figure represents the 
late combustion phase which is the final phase of combustion process in diesel engines.

The author is content with the previous two figures for illustrating the results of simulation 
process of combustion in diesel engine, it should be mentioned that ANSYS program has the ability 
to show the results of simulation at every crank angle. 
Fig. 4 shows a comparison between the experimental results and the simulation results of 
cylinder pressure with crank angle, both experimental and simulated pressure of cylinder gases 
increase from the initial pressure value at 330 CAD till reaching the highest value after TDC by 5 
degrees. After that the pressure starts to drop down gradually till the exhaust valve open EVO. It 
can be seen that the results of simulation are in good agreement with the experimental results 
especially at the first phase of combustion. The deviation between the experimental and simulated 
peak pressure does not exceed 0.3%, which is considered a satisfied result in comparison with the 
results of other simulation studies that performed on diesel engines as well [7,8].

Conclusion 
Eddy dissipation model (EDM) was used successfully for carrying out the simulation of 
combustion process in diesel engine. The results of simulation were illustrated and explained at 
several crank angles at different phases of combustion process. The simulated pressure of engine 
cylinder was explained and validated as well in order to confirm the simulation results. 
After analyzing the simulation results it can be concluded that EDM is a good choice for 
simulating the combustion in diesel engines, and this kind of simulation can be used for diesel 
engine development process, which will reduce the time and costs of diesel engine development.

Experimental Investigation on the Effect of Bioethanol on Emission 
Performance of Diesel Engine for Rapeseed Biodiesel-Diesel Blends

Keywords: bioethanol, bioediesel, blends, emissions. 
Abstract. Global warming and climate change are the motives to find a solution for emission 
reduction of diesel engines. Bioethanol is renewable fuel which can be used in diesel engine as a 
part of biodiesel-diesel blends. The effect of bioethanol on the emission performance of diesel 
engine for rapeseed biodiesel-diesel blends as a function of engine load is evaluated in this paper. 
KDE 6500E diesel generator is used for this purpose. Carbon monoxide (CO), unburned 
hydrocarbons (HC), oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are recorded with the help of 
VLT-4588 exhaust gas analyzer. Blends with higher concentrations of bioethanol have shown lower 
CO emissions while HC emissions increase with the increase in bioethanol concentration in the 
blends.  CO2 emissions are recorded more at higher loads for all types of biodiesel and bioethanol 
concentrations than that of diesel fuel.          
Introduction 
Biodiesel is substitute to diesel fuel which is obtained from renewable energy resources. Exhaust 
gas emissions are lower for biodiesel than that of diesel fuel [1, 2]. Ethanol can be blended with 
biodiesel fuel to improve its physical and chemical properties. Its addition decreases viscosity, 
density and cetane number. Several investigations were carried out to determine the appropriate 
blend ratio for biodiesel-ethanol-diesel blends. Anhydrous ethanol was found to be more soluble in 
diesel –biodiesel blends. Presence of water content in these blends can cause phase separation. 
Increase in ethanol volume of the blend can decrease the inter-solubility of the blends. Physical and 
chemical properties of investigated blends are within the limits of European biodiesel standard EN 
14214 [3, 4 and 5].   
Researchers have tried biodiesel-ethanol-diesel blend in diesel engines as fuel. The emission 
performance of these blends depends upon the concentration of ethanol, water content, type of 
biodiesel and operating conditions of the engine [6]. CO emissions decrease with increase in the 
concentration of ethanol while decrease in NOx emissions was observed [7]. Shi et al. had tried 
these blends in heavy duty diesel engines and concluded that these blends are suitable for emission 
reduction [8]. Higher fuel consumption was recorded for ethanol blends [9].  
  In the present study, we have investigated the effect of commercially available bioethanol on 
the emission performance of single cylinder diesel engine for biodiesel-ethanol-diesel blends. These 
blends are prepared by keeping in view the inter-blend solubility. 
Materials and Methods 
Fuel blends. Biodiesel from rapeseed oil, bioethanol and diesel Euro5 were purchased from local 
distributors. Physical and chemical properties of biodiesel comply with the standard EN 14214. 
Three types of blends are investigated for the emission performance of diesel engine. These include 
D70BD25E5, D45BD45E10 and D55BD30E15.  
 
Experimental setup. KDE 6500E diesel generator is selected to evaluate the emission performance 
of the blends. The specifications of the engine are given in Table 1.

Results and Discussions 
CO emissions. Carbon monoxide as a function of load for biodiesel-diesel-bioethanol blends is 
shown in Fig. 3. Researchers have tried these blends in different proportions and showed 
contradictory results [6, 7]. CO emissions decrease with increase in the concentration of bioethanol. 
These emissions are recorded low at higher loads.  
 
Hydrocarbon emissions. Hydrocarbon emissions indicate the unburnt hydrocarbons during the 
combustion process. These emissions also show the efficiency of combustion. Contradictory results 
can be found in the literature [6]. Experiments reveal that HC emissions increase with increase in 
bioethanol concentration. It is due to the incomplete combustion of blend. Cetane number is lower 
for bioethanol which leads to poor combustion. Decrease in HC emissions is observed at higher 
loads. This is due to complete combustion of the blends at higher loads. Hydrocarbon emissions for 
blends are shown in the Fig. 3.  
   
Oxygen emissions. Biodiesel contains 11% oxygen by weight and it helps to improve combustion 
process. Combustion efficiency is higher for biodiesel than that of diesel fuel due to higer oxygen 
content [10]. Oxygen emissions for the blends are shown in Fig. 4. No significant change in oxygen 
emissions is observed for different blends but these emissions decrease with increasing load. The 
combustion process needs higher amount of oxygen at higher loads.  
 
CO2 emissions. An increasing trend with increasing loads in CO2 emissions can be seen in Fig. 4. 
Increase in concentration of biodiesel in the blend can cause decrease in CO2 emissions [1]. High 
emissions are observed for higher loads as fuel consumption is more at higher loads. These 
emissions are less for B45E15 than the blends with lower concentrations of bioethanol at lower 
loads. At higher loads the emissions are recorded higher for higher concentrations of bioethanol.

Conclusion 
Researchers have found contradictory results of emission performance by using biodiesel-
bioethanol-diesel blends. Operating conditions, specifications of diesel generator and properties of 
blends are the main factors affecting the emission performance. KDE 6500E diesel generator was 
selected to evaluate the emission performance of biodiesel-bioethanol-diesel blends. Experiments 
have revealed that CO emissions are decreased 33% by increasing bioethanol concentration up to 
15% for B30. Low CO emissions are recorded for higher loads. Hydrocarbon emissions are 
recorded higher for increasing concentration of bioethanol while these emissions are lower for 
higher loads. Oxygen emissions are recorded lower for higher loads. CO2 emissions decrease with 
increasing concentration of bioethanol and biodiesel. Carbon dioxide emissions are higher for 
higher loads for all the concentrations of biodiesel and bioethanol.  
Investigated blends are good choice for diesel generator if the aim is to reduce CO and CO2. 
Higher loads have shown lower CO2, O2 and HC emissions for these blends. These lower emissions 
show improvement in combustion process at higher loads. Cetane number of blends decreases with 
the increase in bioethanol concentration which further leads towards poor combustion [4]. This 
problem can be addressed by using cetane number improving additives. The future study may 
include the effect of commercially available cetane number improvers on the emission performance 
of biodiesel-biothanol-diesel blends.

Abstract. Modern data analysis techniques has been successfully applied in many technical 
disciplines to understand the complexity of the system. The growing volume of theoretical 
knowledge about systems dynamic's offered researchers the opportunity to look for non-linear 
dynamics in data whose evolution linear models are unable to explain in a satisfactory manner. One 
of the most recent approach in this respect is Recurrence Analysis - RA. It is a graphical method 
designed to locate hidden recurring patterns, nonstationarity and structural changes. As is presented 
in this paper, the recurrence plot investigation for the analyzing of the gasoline  engine shows some 
of the its capabilities in this domain. We chose two specific engine parameters measured in two 
different tests to perform the RPA. These parameters are ignition angle and engine angular speed. 
There were computed graphs for each of them. Graphs were analyzed and  compared to obtain a 
conclusion.  This work is an incipient research, being one of the first attempt of using recurrence 
plot for analyzing automotive dynamics. It opens a wide field of action for future research programs. 
Introduction 
RA approach have first been applied in natural sciences like physics and biology. Quickly, was 
adopted in economics and engineering. Meanwhile, the fast development of computer resources has 
provided powerful tools to perform this new and complex model. One free software which we used 
to perform the analysis is Visual Recurrence Analysis - VRA developed by Eugene Kononov.     
Recurrence Plot Analysis (RPA) was introduced for the first time in 1987 in the paper published by 
Eckman, Kamhorst and Ruelle [1,2]. A recurrence plot (RP) is an advanced technique of nonlinear 
data analysis. It is a visualization (or a graph) of a square matrix, in which the matrix elements 
correspond to those times at which a state of a dynamical system recurs (columns and rows 
correspond then to a certain pair of times). The RP reveals all the times when the phase space 
trajectory of the dynamical system visits roughly the same area in the phase space [3].  
The starting point of it is the idea that a measured time series is the result of the interaction 
between different relevant variables of a dynamic process. Each of that measured parameter is a 
one-dimension output of a multidimensional dynamic system. The method (RPA) infers 
characteristics of the original system and predicts its behavior in the future given the history of its 
output. It analyzed signal dynamics in reconstructed phase-space and reveals visual information 
about distance correlation between two points of attractor [3].  
A gasoline combustion engine is a highly complex system with a large number of parameters that 
influence its dynamics. Engine angular speed, ignition angle, engine torque, engine power or vehicle 
speed could be considered realizations of that dynamical system. Our research was motivated by the 
desire to identify more intimate dependencies between outputs and inputs of the internal combustion 
engine.

In this respect we've conducted a testing program for a statistically study of vehicle dynamics. 
There were used cars more than 10 cars with 1.6 l petrol engine with mileage ranging 13500 to 
115000 km. Most of the experimental data were acquired and stored in the tester. Those which 
could not be measured using the onboard system were computed using static characteristics of the 
engine that had been obtained on the test bench [4,5].  
Method 
Recurrence Plot.  
    In this method, a one-dimensional time series from a data file is expanded into a higher-
dimensional space, in which the dynamic of the underlying generator takes place. This is done using 
a technique called “delayed coordinate embedding”, which recreates a phase space portrait of the 
dynamical system under study from a single (scalar) time series [3]. 
    Consider that x(i), i=1,N is one of the time series that describes a dynamical system. The 
recurrence plot is an array of dots in a N x N square (a matrix), where a dot is placed at (i, j)  
whenever x(j) is sufficiently close to x(i) [1].

where N is the number of operating variables, or degrees of freedom, in the dynamical system under 
study. One analytical method for estimating the embedding dimension is the False Nearest 
Neighbors method [7]. 
Choosing the optimal time delay is not an easy problem. If it is too long, the coordinates may 
become random in respect to each other. If it is too short, the coordinates used for each 
reconstructed vector will not be independent enough to carry any new information about the 
trajectory of the system in the state space. Usually, Mutual Information Function is used for 
estimating the time delay [7]. 
Each element of the square matrix, called recurrence matrix will receive a pixel, black or white, 
and will be displayed in a monochrome digital image, which is recurrence plot [2]. Also, the 
distances between all vectors are mapped to colors from the pre-defined color map and are 
displayed as colored pixels in their corresponding places. A recurrence plot is essentially a graphical 
representation of a correlation integral. The important distinction is that it, unlike the correlation 
integrals, preserve the temporal dependence in the time series, in addition to the spatial       
dependence [7]. 
The next step and most difficult and interesting in the same time, is to interpret the plot.         
Large-scale structures (typology) and small-scale patterns (texture) can be easily detected [1,2,8]. 
The topology can be characterized as homogeneous, periodic, drift, and disrupted. Texture can be 
classified in single/isolated dots, diagonal, horizontal/vertical lines, rectangular clusters [2]. If the 
underlying signal is truly random and has no structure, the distribution of colors over the RP will be 
uniform, and so there will not be any identifiable patterns. If, on the other hand, there is some 
determinism in the signal generator, it can be detected by some characteristic, distinct distribution of 
colors. The length of diagonal line segments of the same color on the RP can give you an idea about 
the signal predictability [7].  
Recurrence plot to analyze gasoline engine parameters  
The parameters to be analyzed are ignition angle and engine angular speed. Each of them is 
dependent of a number of other parameters with a more or less statistical variation. There were 
chosen 10n tests of 10 cars, one test of one car. The idea was to compare parameters of engines with 
different wear.   
First, we used the mutual information function and false nearest neighbors method to estimate the 
time delay and the embedding dimension for each parameter and test. 
Fig.1 and Fig.2 presents the results for choosing the embedding dimension and time delay of 
ignition angle for test I57n, m=2 and n=6.  
Table 1 shows the results for embedding dimension and time delay of ignition angle and engine 
angular speed for all 10 tests. The computed embedding dimension m for both parameters respects, 
as can be seen in the table the rule noted by formula (7). Indeed, ignition angle is determined by 6 
variables: air pressure, air temperature, engine's load, engine angular speed, battery voltage and 
engine temperature.

As a first conclusion, ignition angle seems to be more deterministic variable than the engine 
angular speed. Deterministic nature of it is confirmed by the Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. There are some 
diagonal lines  with evolution of states similar at different times. Similarities cannot be observed in 
recurrence plot of engine angular speed in Fig 6.  Electronic control unit sets the ignition angle 
based on deterministic variables mentioned before, while the angular engine speed is more 
influenced by stochastic sizes, like traffic conditions. All processes analyzed are non stationary, 
none of plots presents homogeneity.

Summary 
Usually, when studying a dynamic process like a gasoline engine functioning process it isn't 
possible to measure all the variables. So, it is measured one or a group of state parameters. 
Important data about the evolution of the dynamic process can be obtained having these time series 
and using recurrence plot analysis. This paper is an attempt of using RPA for analyzing gasoline 
engine dynamics. Yet, even if it is mostly a qualitative tool, recurrence plot is extremely powerful 
and useful in analyzing dynamical systems. To accomplish a qualitative recurrence plot analysis, a 
quantitative approach has to consider.  Future developments could lead to recognition of each 
engine based on graph obtained by this method. Also, it could be used to perform an extremely 
sensitive diagnose of vehicle systems. There is a vast field of applications for using this method in 
automotive.

Abstract. The efficiency of the turbochargers is not satisfactory while the supercharged engine is 
working at low speeds. The dual supercharging can represent a solution to improve the 
supercharging process efficiency of the turbochargers. Due to the different functioning principles of 
the turbochargers and the pressure wave superchargers, this compressors are not having the same 
efficiency when the engines is running at a certain speed. The pressure wave superchargers can 
operate with a satisfactory efficiency at low-medium engine speeds. For this reason the dual 
supercharging with turbocharger-pressure wave supercharger is making the supercharging processes 
applied on engines more efficient. The two supercharging compressors are compressing the intake 
air by using a part of the exhaust gases energy. Due to the pressure wave supercharger rotor is 
having only gas distribution role, the power needed to drive it is reduced. The driving of the rotor 
can be realized by the crankshaft or by an electric motor. 
Introduction 
The recovery of energy losses from exhaust gasses can continue to be a solution to improve the 
performance fuel economy of the internal combustion engines. This can be said considering the fact 
that significant quantity of the energy of the burnt fuel within the internal combustion engine 
cylinders is lost through the exhaust gases. Continue implementation of solutions that reduce fuel 
consumption of these engines is way more important since the CO2 emissions must be reduced 
significantly until 2020. The difficulty of reduction the emissions in general consist in the fact that 
this reduction must be accomplished without affecting the power performances of vehicles [1].  
A solution in this sense is the dual supercharging. This solution increases the energy recovering 
level from the exhaust gases whit the purpose to increase the efficiency of the supercharging 
process. Using dual supercharging as turbochargers or pressure wave superchargers (PWS), the 
quantity of energy lost through exhaust gases will be reduced. This two compressors are using the 
exhaust gases energy to compress the intake air. The performances of the engines supercharged dual 
is higher than the performances of the engines that are equipped with exclusively one of the two 
compressors, because in this case each compressors advantages are exploited.  
General Aspects Regarding the Performances of the Supercharged Engines 
The performances of internal combustion engine are improved significantly if they are 
supercharged with compressors that are using exhaust gases energy to compress the intake air. The 
work done by these engines is higher than the work done by the naturally aspirated engines. This 
situation is due to the surplus of work resulted from filling the cylinders with air by the 
supercharging compressor and also because the maximum pressure increase within the cylinder. 
The efficiency of the turbocharger depends significantly of the exhaust gas flow rate which is 
entering the turbine. This way at medium-low engine speeds, characterized by reduced exhaust gas 
flow rates, the turbocharger efficiency is not satisfactory [2, 3].  
On the other hand, the efficiency of the PWS is not dependent of exhaust gas flow rate, but of the 
exhaust gas pressure.

 This way high intake pressures can be achieved even at reduced speeds of the engine. Generally 
the PWS is driven by the engines crankshaft. 
The main condition to maintain the compressors efficiency as high as possible is to control the 
compressor speed with each value of the exhaust gases pressure, for all engine speed. For this, the 
PWS can be driven by an electric motor with variable speed [4, 5]. With this innovative drive 
solution the condition set forth above can be successfully fulfilled. In Fig. 1 can be observed the 
efficiency of the PWS according to two solutions: driving by an electric motor with variable speed 
and driven by the speed that is proportional to the crank shaft speed.  
The pressure wave supercharger driven by an electric motor is achievable because the work 
needed to compress the intake air is done by the exhaust gases. The compressors rotor has only the 
purpose to distribute the gases. 
 
                           
 
Fig. 1. Supercharging pressure achieved by training the PWS speed independent from the engine, 
compared with pressure obtained by training with a speed which is proportional to the crankshaft 
 
It can be observed that the driving speed has a significant influence on the quality of the 
supercharging process. By driving the compressor with variable speed the intake air pressure 
modifies up to 9 %. The compressor driven by the crankshaft, regardless the ratio between the its 
speed and the engine speed, has a lower efficiency compared when it is driven by the electric motor. 
It can be observed that the speed range in which that the PWS is driven by the electric engine is 
narrower than in the case of being driven by the crankshaft.  
The difference between the functional principles of the turbocharger and the PWS makes their 
efficiency to be different for the same engine speeds.  
Dual Supercharging System with Turbocharger and Pressure Wave Supercharger  
Two of the dual supercharging solutions that were frequently used are: the turbocharger-
mechanically driven blower and the turbocharger-mechanically driven Roots compressor [6, 7]. 
By using this solutions the insufficiencies of the turbocharger at low engine speeds (low 
supercharging pressure and turbocharger lag) are compensated with the qualities of the mechanically 
driven compressors. Additionally, in order to make the turbocharger more efficient there are used 
solutions of supercharging in stage by using two turbochargers connected in parallel or in series [8].

Each of this solutions proved their performances and limits. For example the mechanically driven 
compressors are having a short acceleration response time but a great quantity of energy is 
consumed from the crankshaft, which is an important disadvantage. Additionally, the efficiency of 
the Roots compressor decreases with the increase of the driving speed. 
In this context the dual supercharging with turbocharger-PWS solution represents a complement 
to these types of solutions that improves the quality of supercharging process. 
The functioning principle of the dual supercharging turbocharger-PWS is similar to the dual 
supercharging principle of the turbocharger-Roots compressor (Fig. 3).

This new dual supercharging solution implies (like in the case of the dual supercharging with the 
Roots compressor) the supercharging with a PWS at low-medium engine speeds, followed by the 
supercharging with the turbocharger. The difference between the two solutions consist in the 
replacement of the Roots compressor with a PWS. 
When the engine is supercharged with the turbocharger, than the flap, 5, is closed and 
electrovalve, 4, evacuating gases in the environment. In this case the electric motor is stopped. 
The major difference between this and the existent solutions is that the power consumed to drive 
the PWS is lower. Some experimental research revealed the fact that it is necessary a power up to 
350 [W] to drive a Comprex type PWS [5].  
The exhaust gases flow is higher the power to drive the supercharger is lower, because at the 
moment the exhaust gases enters the channels of the rotor they creates a positive torque which acts 
on the rotor. 
In this case of dual supercharging the PWS can be driven by the crankshaft. Due to it works on a 
restrained speed range its efficiency will be satisfactory. Also the PWS can be driven at variable or 
sequential speed by an electric motor [9]. Besides this two driving solutions improves the efficiency 
of the PWS they also eliminates the direct energy consumption from the engine. This way the

energy consumption from the crankshaft can be reduced while the engine is functioning at low 
speeds. The electric energy required to drive the PWS can be stored in battery.  
Analysis and Research Results  
 
In case of dual supercharging system, the two compressors way of functioning is not significantly 
different from a conventional superchargers functioning that has only one compressor. 
In case of the turbocharger, the turbine is connected directly to the engine like in the case of the 
conventional supercharging. The difference consists in the fact that, in case of the dual 
supercharging (in some engine operating modes), the air compressed by the pressure wave 
supercharger is circulating through the blower, as in the case of the supercharging with 
turbocharger-mechanical supercharger.    
The major difference between the proposed dual supercharging system and the conventional 
supercharging with PWS consists in the fact that between the engine and this compressor is situated 
the turbocharger. For this reason, the gases are entering the PWS with less energy [10]. The pressure 
of the exhaust gases at the exit of the turbine is lower than the pressure at the entrance of the 
turbine. However, according to [4, 11] and to Fig. 4, this aspect is not influencing significantly the 
efficiency of the PWS.

influenced by the exhaust gas pressure but by the corelation of the PWS speed with the exhaust gas 
pressure. 
Practically, the optimal speed to which PWS needs to run is modified once with the modification 
of the pressure of the exhaust gases to maintain a high supercharging pressure. Therefore by driving 
the PWS by an electric motor can be diminished the negative effects on this supercharging 
compressor, caused by the pressure drop of the exhaust gases in the turbine. 
Next, in Table 1, there are presented some initial experimental results with regard to the

Conclusions 
The dual supercharging improves the quality of the supercharging processes. The engine 
performances significantly increase if two compressors are used to compress the intake air using the 
energy of the exhaust gasses. Due to the special functioning principles, the PWS can create a high 
intake pressure within the low engine speeds. This way the turbochargers disadvantages at low 
speeds are eliminated. 
The functioning principle of the dual supercharging with turbocharger-PWS is similar to the 
functioning principle of the dual supercharging with turbocharger-Roots compressor. The difference 
between the two solutions consist in the replacement of the Roots compressor with a PWS. The 
performances of the PWS are substantial. 
The driving of the PWS requires a low quantity of energy consumption. Therefore it can be 
driven by an electric motor, which improves the efficiency of the supercharging processes and the 
supercharged engine global performances.

Abstract.  In this paper is presented the dynamic study on the fuel feeding line of a compression 
ignition two stroke engine with two cylinders. The common rail type feeding line is working on a 
pressure of 1600 bar. To provide a uniformity of the fuel dosage introduced in the cylinder and a 
suitable control of fuel mixture realization a study was made of dynamic phenomenons that occur 
during the openings and closings of the injectors. The mathematic model was calibrated based on 
the experiments done on the engine.  
Introduction 
The common rail injection system with electric adjustment provides a higher flexibility and 
capacity of adaptation of the injection system to the engine necessities than the conventional 
systems by using a common rail injection system the following advantages are known: the 
achieving of a high injection pressure (of 1400-2000 bar), the possibility to modify the injection 
starting angle, the possibility of multiple injections, the possibility to adjust the parameters 
depending on the engine.  To reduce the fuel consumption, the emissions and the noise pollution it 
is necessary to use different injection strategies for different operating regimes [1]. 
In case of the common rail injection systems there exists the possibility to adjust the injection 
parameters independently of the engine speed, which leads to the increase of the fuel mixture 
formation quality and optimization of the combustion process [2]. The form of the injection law has 
a primordial importance on the fuel mixture forming process, combustion process and the level of 
comfort gained while it is functioning. The pre-injection is conditioning the burning chamber and 
through its effects it has the advantage to decrease: the noise produced by the burning process, the 
fuel consumption and pollution emissions. The main injection is directly influencing the engine 
functional parameters through the injected fuel quantity and its variation law. The post-injection has 
a major impact on pollution emissions reduction [3]. 
General System Description: 
The fuel system (Fig. 1.) that operates under a two-stroke thermodynamic cycle is a high 
pressure common rail system comprised of a high pressure 3 plunger rotary pump that delivers 
pressurized fuel to a common rail. The fuel pump is rotating with the same speed as the engine. The 
common rail is connected to 4 individual accumulators. Each accumulator feeds an electronically 
controlled injector through a relatively short high pressure line. There are two injectors per cylinder 
that are injecting at the same time the same amount of fuel so the entire fuel amount per cycle and 
cylinder is split equally between the two injectors . All accumulators and lines that connect the 
accumulators with the injectors are identical.

Fig.1 The fuel system of engine 
Accumulator #4 was equipped with a high speed pressure sensor. The data was collected for 3 
engine operating points with three injection strategies: 
1. One main injection per cycle and cylinder 
2. One pilot injection, one main and one post injection 
3. One pre-pilot injection, one main and one post injection 
In order to fully understand the dynamic pressure variation through the entire fuel system a 
hydro-dynamic simulation was made by following the next steps: 
A. Calibration of the mathematical model 
The mathematical model was calibrated for the three engine operating points. The calibration s 
sat is factory if the simulated pressures for all three points in the accumulator #4 matches the 
dynamic pressures recorded during engine testing considering the engine boundary conditions. 
B. Simulation of 6 engine operating points for each of the injection strategies. 
The 6 engine operating points are defined in Table 1.

Since the engine operating map is not fully developed and the simulation is not influenced by the

-  The start of injection is fixed to 20 Crank Angle Degree Before Top Dead Center (20 
CAD BTDC) 
 
2. For injection strategy #2 (One pilot injection, one main and one post injection) 
- The main injection is 78% of the total amount of fuel injected per cycle 
- The pilot injection is 13% of the total amount of fuel injected per cycle 
- The post injection is 9% of the total amount of fuel injected per cycle

3. For injection strategy #3 (One pre-pilot injection, one pilot injection, one main and one

- The main injection is 70% of the total amount of fuel injected per cycle 
- The pre-pilot injection is 10% from the total amount of fuel injected per cycle 
- The pilot injection is 10% of the total amount of fuel injected per cycle 
- The post injection is 10% of the total amount of fuel injected per cycle 
The common rail system was analyzed at a pressure of 1600 bar for the 6 points and three 
injections strategies. To verify the influence of the common rail pressure on the dynamic pressure 
waves in the system, the 4 full loaded engine points were simulated only for injection strategy #3, 
also at a rail pressure of 1000 bar.

Conclusions 
 
Simulation results for different engine speeds and loads are showing a series of conclusions: 
 Very fast opening of the injector generates in front of the injector, high pressure 
amplitudes, up to 100 bar approximately 6,25%, considering the mean pressure 1600 bar.  
 The induced pressure amplitudes are at very high frequencies – approximately 3 CAD  
 At accumulator and connection pipe level the pressure amplitudes are smaller, up to 60 
bar, approximately at very low frequencies - approximately 150 CAD 
 The accumulator reduces significantly the pressure amplitudes and frequencies. 
 The important oscillations are generated at injector opening. The rapid closing of the 
injector doesn’t induce higher amplitude waves as expected that hydraulic ram waves 
may occur. 
 Smaller speed is associated with more rapid decrease of pressure amplitudes due to a 
longer available time up to the next perturbation. The amplitude reduction is generated by 
the reflection at accumulator level. 
 Smaller loads have more intense amplitudes due to a shorter injection opening. The more 
rapid closing of the injector sustains the oscillation process.

Keywords: pressure wave supercharger, Simulation model, Diesel engine, optimizing 
Abstract. In order to efficiently supercharge Diesel engines with pressure wave superchargers it is 
necessary to correlate the superchargers rotation speed with certain parameters of the supercharged 
engine. For this purpose, to reduce the research costs and duration, simulation models can be used 
which help to determine the parameters which have a major impact on the supercharger's rotational 
speed and efficiency. In this paper there are presented two simulation models: a one-dimensional 
(made in AMESim software) and a three dimensional (made in Fluent Software). This simulation 
models offer the possibility to visualize some dynamic phenomenon within the supercharger, like 
the evolution of the pressure waves or the turbulent flow inside the rotor channels. These 
phenomena are difficult and expensive to study with conventional methods. 
Introduction 
 
Comprex type pressure wave superchargers are used to supercharge Diesel engines. The main 
components of such an aggregate are: the cylindrical rotor which is crossed from one end to the 
other by cellular channels disposed in two rows, the stator trough which circulates the exhaust 
gases, stator of the intake air, and the shaft of the rotor which is partially assembled in the intake air 
stator. The rotor is installed in a case in which it has the two stators on its extremities. The pressure 
wave supercharger compress the intake air using the exhaust gases. The compression process is 
taking place inside the rotor. The particularity of this process lays in the fact that the exhaust gases 
are in direct contact with the intake gases inside the rotor channels. This way during a cycle the 
volume of a cell is passed over successively by both exhaust and intake gases. Regarding the 
precedents, to optimize the Diesel engine with the Comprex, the compressed air flow (like in case of 
turbochargers) and the supercharger speed correlation with the exhaust gas parameters need to be 
considered [1]. The direct consequences of not correlating the superchargers speed with the exhaust 
gas evolutions can be: the efficiency reduction of the compressing process within the channels or 
uncontrolled growth rate of recalculated exhaust gas in the Diesel engine. The pressure wave 
superchargers can be driven with variable speed separately from the Diesel engine using an 
electrical engine [2].  
 
Due to the pressure difference between the exhaust gases that enters the rotor channels and the 
intake air that is already inside them, a pressure wave occurs witch propagates from the hot zone to 
the cold zone of the rotor. This pressure wave causes, inside the channels, dynamic phenomena 
which are complex, difficult to control and observe through experimental research [3].  
 
The identification of the parameters on which depends the quality of the supercharging can be 
done with virtual simulation models. Therefore, this paper proposes three models of virtual analysis 
through which we can identify key parameters that influence the value of the compressor speed, and 
thus its effectiveness.

Parameterization of the simulation models 
The geometrical parameters of the two simulation models are similar to those of the Comprex 
type pressure wave supercharger CX-93 model. Practically these parameters, shown in figure1, 
represent the main dimensions of the rotor, as visible in Fig. 1b, and the frontal area of the two 
stators (hot stator, Fig. 1a and cold stator Fig. 1c). Beside these geometric dimensions, in the 
simulation models there were used some constants such as: such as the universal gas constant, 
polytrophic exponent of air and exhaust gases, pressure and temperature.

Fig. 1 Main geometric parameters used for the simulation model sizing 
 
After analyzing the pressure wave fundamental equations, according [4], it can be concluded that 
the main parameters on which depend the level of optimization of the Comprex with the Diesel 
engine are: pressure and temperature of the exhaust gasses in the moment of entering in the 
channels, as well as of the air which is already inside of them and the speeds of opening of the 
exhaust and intake gas window.  
The parameters which need to be correlated with the Comprex speed are considered as the 
Comprex input data which are determined by experimental research.  
Further, the two simulation models will be presented: the one dimensional and the three-
dimensional. 
Description of the analysis simulation models 
One-dimensional model (1D). The 1D approach makes it possible to move forward in the physical 
description of gas dynamics in systems. Whereas the standard lumped approaches allows users to 
treat low velocity flows (Mach<0.3), the AMESim tool breaks these limitations with the possibility 
to simulate the details of pressure waves and shocks with a high level of accuracy. A simple model 
is considered, (see Fig. 2). It can be used to simulate the flow in a pipe between two infinite 
volumes with two different states. It can be seen in the figure that the Pneumatic library is used to 
model both the volume and the fluid properties. 
The used mathematical model is the Method of Differences which approaches complex flows 
taking into account the interactions for non-stationary, anisentrope and one-dimensional conditions. 
The dissipation conditions are taken in consideration through semiempirical models. The 
constitutive equations describe a perfect fluid. The independent variables which define the flow plan 
are the one-dimensional space x and the time t. The principle of this method consists in the 
development of differences to replace the partial differentials along the independent variables. To 
achieve this, the spatial and time dimensions are discretized in disjoint subdomains which form a 
network. Therefore the solutions are calculated in these networks nodes.

The fundamental idea of the Method of Finite Differences is that the derivatives are replaced 
with differences, respectively the local development of differential operations in truncated Taylor 
series. In order to provide an increased convergence for the method it is applied the Lax-Wendroff 
convergence criteria. 
The components of the one-dimensional model are: 1, 2 - intake and exhaust gas state parameters; 3, 
4 - pressure and temperature sources for the intake and exhaust gases; 5 – opening function of inlet 
window 7; 6 – opening function of exhaust window 8; 9 – cellular channels of the rotor. 
 
Fig.2. One-dimensional simulation model of the Comprex type pressure wave supercharger 
 
Submodels 1 and 2 are defining the specific parameters of the two gases that are crossing the 
rotor channels. The windows 7 and 8 are designed as orifices whose opening is controlled by the 
functions 5 and 6. These functions are having a growth, a constant and a decline area. The 
increase/decrease slope of the function from the closed position to the open and vice versa is 
proportional to the compressors driving speed. The submodels 7 and 8 contain flow coefficients that 
take account of frictional losses and the leaks that occur during the compressor functioning. The 
considered channels 9 are discretized through a series of pneumatic tube sub-models which take 
account of the compressibility of the two gases. The results accuracy, regarding the evolution of the 
phenomenon within the channels grows with the level of discretization. Thus, for the series 
connection of pneumatic tube type sub-models, a characteristic length of 1 mm and a time constant 
of 10th-6s were chosen. 
 
Tridimensional model (3D). This model can be built using Fluent software, which uses the Finite 
Volume Method for the calculation and simulation of the fluid flow processes described through 
Euler type equation systems.  
The Finite Volume Method allows solving of three-dimensional anisentrope and non-stationary 
complex equation systems. 
These equations systems are not admitting exact solutions; they require the application of 
numerical methods. 
The application of the method implies special calculation resources. 
Applying the method involves also the integration of the characteristic equations on a restrained 
space named finite volume or control volume. Each finite volume is associated to one or more 
points (nodes) in which the unknown variables are calculated. The geometrical property of the finite 
volumes is that they are in contact through the nodes which are placed at the finite volumes 
boundary. It is useful that the control volume limits to be at the limit of computation domain and in 
the areas where sudden property variations occur. Thus, to apply the method, it is necessary to 
replace the geometric model with a set of finite volumes which approximates the geometry of 
interest. The finite volumes are connected by nodes which forms the discretization network. To this 
geometrical conditions are applied the Eulerian formulation of the flow equations. The problem’s 
solving is done at the level of nodes, and in between the solutions are interpolated.   
Because the shape of the pressure wave supercharger’s rotor is symmetrical on its entire length, 
the flow modeling through the channel was made for only one sector of the real volume of the 
analyzed channel (Figure 3). Periodicity boundary conditions are imposed to this volume. This way 
optimal discretization of the geometric volume can be achieved without involving extreme 
calculation resources.

     Fig.4. Discretization of the analyzed model 
 
In the simulations performed with the 3D model, the intake window of the exhaust (1) is actually 
moved from the grooves of the rotor (Fig. 3, 2). The pressure losses of the pressure wave 
supercharger due to leaks can be researched by taking in consideration the gaps between the 
Comprex’s stator and rotor, as well as the gaps (Fig. 3, 3) between the rotor and its housing.  
Another aspect that the simulation model takes into account is the turbulent nature of the fluids 
flowing through the compressor. In this sense the Shear-Stress Transport model was chosen, which 
is based on the turbulent kinetic energy transport (k) and dissipation rate (omega) equations.  
This model succeeds to establish a good compromise between the necessary calculation 
resources and the precision of the results. At the geometric model discretization, a special attention 
is given for the interface areas of intake and exhaust gases, in the areas where the primary and 
secondary waves propagates, as well as in the flow boundary layer areas. Similar to the one-
dimensional simulation model, a characteristic domain length of 1 mm was chosen, except at the 
flow boundary layer where was adopted a discretization specific to this flow area (Fig. 4). The time 
constant is the same as the one used in the case of the one-dimensional model: 10-6s. 
Results and validation of the analysis made on the three simulation models 
For each analysis model it was determined the level of influence of the COMPREX input 
parameters on the COMPREX's common operation quality with diesel engine. Further, Fig. 5 
illustrates how input parameters vary in relation to the speed of COMPREX for each of the two 
simulation models. The pressure of air within the channels is considered constant in the conditions 
of some experimental research conducted on testing benches.

Current Solutions in Mechanical Engineering

The analysis of the exhaust gas intake window opening speed was achieved with one-
dimensional analysis model (Fig. 5a.). The influence of this parameter on the Comprex speed value 
affects the value of primary pressure wave’s amplitude. This fact can be proved by comparing the 
exhaust gas pressures evolution from the one-dimensional model presented above and from a 
simplified model in which the intake and exhaust orifices with variable openings are eliminated. As 
advantages of the one-dimensional simulation model can be named: simplicity in implementation; 
easy accessibility due to validation libraries attached to the predefined submodels of AMESim 
software; the need of reduced computing resources and high quantitative and quality accuracy in 
terms of obtained results.  
The significant influence of the exhaust gas pressure on the optimum speed of the compressor is 
maintained also in the case of the tridimensional model (Fig. 5b). Due to the spatial nature of the 
three-dimensional model, the influence of the losses, due to leaks between the rotor and stator, on 
the compressor driving speed can be analyzed. By comparing a perfectly sealed ideal model and a 
real model with a gap of 0.2 mm between the stator and the rotor it was found that there are 
differences below 1% between the input parameter values. Therefore it can be used an ideal model 
without introducing a major risk of error compared to a real model.  
This significantly improves the accuracy of the results and reduce the computing resources 
because the fluid flows through the gap between the rotor and compressor stators are a powerful 
source of numerical instability which negatively affects the solving the simulated flow problem.  
Analyzing comparatively the compressors driving speed variation depending on the exhaust gas 
pressure obtained in the one-dimensional and three-dimensional models case (Fig. 6), it can be 
observed that the influence of the turbulent and spatial nature of the gas flows through the rotor 
channels. 
 
Fig.6. Comparison between the one and three dimensional models 
 
In order to use these simulation models to optimize the common functioning of a Comprex type 
pressure wave supercharger with a Diesel engine it is necessary to validate the models by comparing 
the simulation results with the experimental results.  
For the evaluation of the accuracy of 1D and 3D simulation, an experimental determination of 
the optimal speed supercharger drive PWS (Pressure Wave Supercharger) within 5 operating modes 
was applied, using as optimization criteria the maximum cylinder pressure and maximum boost 
pressure. Speeds obtained with 1D and 3D simulations were compared with the optimal drive value 
determined with the experiment. The conditions in which the simulations for various operating 
conditions were made, identical to real case, have as initial conditions: p_eg (exhaust gas pressures) = 
1.6 bar, T_eg (exhaust gas temperature) = 710 K, Pa0 (atmospheric pressure) = 0.97 bar, Ta0 
(atmospheric temperature) = 297 K. 
The tridimensional analysis gives a superior precision, (7.4% maximum error) compared to the 
one-dimensional model (8.3% maximum error). However, the one-dimensional model is more 
flexible due to its modular structure and requires much less computing resources.

Conclusions  
The simulation models presented in this paper offers the possibility to visualize dynamic 
phenomenon within the pressure wave supercharger like: the evolution of pressure waves or 
turbulent flow inside the rotor channels. These phenomena would be extremely difficult and 
expensive to study using conventional investigative systems. 
The important advantage of the 1D mathematical model is that they are easy to implement for a 
large domain of applications. The disadvantages results from the difficulty to model: complex 
extreme conditions, complex geometries, special properties of the fluids and identification of 
conditions where strong nonlinear phenomenon occur. 
The advantage of the 3D simulation method consists in the possibility to increase the accuracy of 
the results by refining the discretization network. It permits the design of complex geometries and 
non-stationary regimes taking into account the fluid properties and their dependency for state 
parameters during the simulations.   
Generally for the study of global phenomena, like the gas pressure and temperature variations 
within the rotor, it can be used the 1D model and to capture the local or spatial nature phenomena 
such as turbulent gas flow inside the channels is necessary to use the 3D model. Thus the difficulty 
of the calculation for complex geometries in which there are flows with significant variations of the 
state parameters is justified.

Abstract. This paper analyzes the numerical research carried out on a single-cylinder research 
engine. 1D engine simulation tools are widely used to model the combustion and gas flow processes 
in a four-stroke spark ignited engine. LES software represents a powerful tool for optimization of 
engine dynamic processes and parameters. The simulation and design of engines can drastically 
reduce time and costs in automotive industry. 1D advance systems are needed for an effective 
boosting of the engine. A mono cylindrical spark ignition engine was analyzed to determine the 
performance and general parameters. 
Introduction 
Because of climate change processes, the transport industry and more particularly the automotive 
sector are subject to environmental regulations prescribing to investigate low greenhouse gases 
emissions strategies [1]. Numerical analyses can in fact drastically reduce the number of 
experiments and prototypes during the early design stages, as well as contribute to the investigation 
of a wide number of control strategies during the engine calibration phase, providing the designers a 
“virtual calibration” environment. Particularly, many issues related to the design (comparison of 
different components and turbochargers) and calibration (identification of proper valve actuation, 
EGR and turbocharger strategy at part and full load, as well) of a modern spark ignition engine can 
be successfully accomplished by means of 1D codes. [2]. MultiD and 1D thermo-fluid dynamic 
models are commonly used to optimize the engine design through the prediction of the unsteady 
flows in the intake and exhaust systems and of the combustion and emission formation processes in 
the cylinder [3]. Many commercial packages have been utilized and are available to solve 
engineering problems related to optimization and design of internal combustion engines (ICEs). 
Currently are four main engine simulation commercial packages used in the automotive industry: 
Lotus Engine Simulation (LESoft), AVL fire, Ricardo Wave (RW), and GT-Power [4]. Since CFD 
modeling of the whole engine is not feasible 1D codes are frequently used to optimize complex 
boosting systems for improved engine performance. Still, a 1D flow assumption through these 
components may not be sufficiently accurate for component optimization. On-engine measurements 
are required for model calibration as their predictive performance is limited [5]. Computational 
Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations used in automotive industry allow engineers to understand flow 
behavior and quantify important flow parameters such as pressure drops or mass flow rates, with the 
condition that CFD tools have been properly validated against experimental data. For reasons such 
as the aforementioned, CFD package programs have become a valuable tool in helping both the 
design and analysis of the intake and exhaust systems of various ICEs. Many processes in the engine 
are simulated 3-D but it requires greater knowledge of the processes involved and large 
computational time. Thus simplified 1-D simulation of engines is often used [6]. In 1-D simulation, 
equations for conservation of energy, momentum, and mass are solved in time and in one dimension 
along the main flow direction in the engine pipes. Additional models, measurements, or correlations 
are needed in 1-D capturing 3-D phenomena such as combustion and flow over valves [7, 8]. The 
Lotus Engine Simulation program is capable of modeling the processes of gas flow and combustion 
computing the indicated and brake parameters of the engine while considering the friction

phenomena and the influence of the heat transfer. Lotus Engine Simulation program represents a 
useful tool for optimization of engine dynamic parameters and processes [4]. In this paper the 
authors simulate the engine parameters based on engine specifications and evaluate the possibility to 
use LES software in educational processes to analyze different mono cylindrical engines. 
System-level virtual prototyping 
Some reports suggested that has been found a 40% reduction in automotive parts defect due to 
the use of simulation programs involved in each step of developing and manufacture. Also is 
possible a reduction in costs through the use of simulation-based design processes and virtual 
prototyping applied to system-level design [9].  Nowadays the engineers can evaluate and develop 
new methodologies to system-level design which includes Digital Mock-Up tools to analyze the 
object. A direct link between Digital Mock-up, Virtual Factory Simulation, and Functional Virtual 
Prototyping provides a way for realizing an effective transition from traditional CAD/CAM/CAE to 
System-level Virtual Prototyping [9]. In Fig.1 are presented the main phases in the development and 
analyses of a product in automotive industry. 
 
 
Fig. 1 Phases of functional virtual prototyping [9] 
Methods and materials 
The development of contemporary society has made CAD CAM and CAE tools and methods 
have increasingly more applications. DMU (Digital mock-up system), a tool to build a virtual mock-
up in the design stage, is used widely to prevent the mismatches and interferences during precision 
assembly and design processes without physical mock-ups. The 1-D engine simulation model was 
performed by using a software code (LES) and has been employed to analyze the performance of a 
gasoline engine. Lotus Single Engine Simulation is used to simulate the performance of the engine 
by 3 basic steps:  
- Construction of simulation model and engine specifications. The basic engine data include 
engine geometry (stroke, bore, connector rod length, compression ratio and others engine elements), 
engine inertia (mass and inertia of different components), cylinder and valve event phasing. 
- Data and test conditions are defined for the cycle simulation. 
- Calculation results for cycle-averaged data (power, brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), 
torque, volumetric efficiencies), and intra-cycle data (pressure, mass flow rate, temperature). 
The simulation was set to make the calculation of the values at 7 exact RPMs (1000-7000, step 
by 1000). All simulation of engine parameters took about 2 hours (2,4GHz X5, 2Gb ddr3). The 
engine main characteristics are presented in the table 1.

Some intuition was used to determine the parameters of the engine due to the lack of information 
on the engine (certain data about the engine was chosen by consulting similar engines). The Annand 
model is selected to characterize the convective and radiative heat transfer coefficients in the engine 
cylinder. Were used different coefficients in the open and closed periods of the cylinder due to the 
different gas compositions and temperatures in the engine cycle. Small discrepancies in the results 
of the simulation may be explained by the different implementations of sub models (heat transfer 
sub-model and combustion sub-model) and various physical-chemical properties of fuel and 
combustion products.

Conclusions 
1D approach can be useful for the development accurate and consistent, computationally 
inexpensive of engine models which can be easily coupled to optimization codes for the 
optimization of modern SI engines. Different parameters of engine such as such as bore size, stroke 
length, valve timing, and compression ratio give significant impact to the engine performance. This 
paper has proven that LES software can be utilized as an integral part of the power train design and 
development process. The quality of simulation results depends on the data input which comprises 
the model. By using 1D software leads to a reduction in costs and risks of damage by providing a 
more robust solution when engine is optimized. Future work will be focused on comparison of the 
results computed in virtual simulation with real engine bed tests, implementation of the control 
algorithms on different systems of the engine,valve, ignition and injection timing to control the 
performance of engine.

Keywords: wind turbine, planetary gear, speed increaser, steady-state regime, mechanical 
characteristic, running point, analytical model, analysis.  
Abstract. Planetary transmissions used as speed increasers in wind/hydro conversion systems 
typically rely on the conventional concept of mechanism with one input and one output. This 
concept is found in most of the high power wind turbines; however, the need to implement in the 
built environment smaller wind turbines with speed increaser led to new turbine concepts such as 
counter-rotating rotors and classical generator. The paper presents a comparative analysis of two 
novel wind turbines with one rotor and two counter-rotating rotors, respectively, which contain 
identical electrical generators and the same type of speed increaser used both as a 1 DOF and 2 DOF 
mechanism respectively. With the assumption of maintaining the same electrical generator running 
point for both wind turbines, the steady-state behaviour of the considered turbines is identified and a 
comparative kinematic and static performance analysis is performed, aiming at highlighting the 
impact on efficiency and on constructive design and development of the two turbines. 
Introduction 
The 2DOF planetary increasers used in renewable energy systems (RES) fulfil the requirement of 
increasing the output speed by exploiting their property of summing the independent input speeds; 
also, by allowing the summation of mechanical energy flows they ensure an increased efficiency of 
the renewable energy (wind or water) conversion into electricity. Thus, the 2 DOF planetary 
transmissions have superior performances compared to the 1 DOF ones. 
In literature many results on planetary transmissions are reported, being analyzed in terms of 
kinematic, static and dynamic behaviour. Roland and Yves [1] proposed a unified model for the 
kinematic ratio and efficiency modelling of epicyclic gear trains. The 2 DOF planetary transmissions 
were dynamically analyzed in a matrix approach, based on inverse dynamic modelling [2]. Other 
papers deal with the dynamic behaviour of various planetary transmissions, such as gearset with 
flexible ring gear [3], herringbone planetary gear and variable speed [4], planetary gear with the time-
varying pressure angle [5], planetary increasers with two coaxial (cylindrical gears) or parallel inputs 
(bevel gears) [6] or transmissions used in wind turbines with two counter-rotating rotors, coaxial and 
parallel, interconnected by a 2 DOF planetary gearset [7, 8]. 
Modelling the planetary transmissions’ efficiencies was also addressed in many papers. 
Analytical expression of the efficiency for 1 DOF planetary transmission was presented in [9], 
which introduced two calculation methods: one based on the equations of torques and rotational 
speeds, and the second one using the relations between power and transmission ratios. An efficiency 
comprehensive analysis based on an analytical modelling and experimental validation for a 2 DOF 
planetary transmission was reported by Chao and Jiabin [10], stating that the efficiency is dependent 
on the combination of inputs. 
In the RES domain, the planetary transmissions are mainly used in wind turbines. As known, the 
wind speed has a major influence on the turbine dynamic behaviour. A dynamic model for a wind

turbine with constant speed is shown in [11]; similarly, but in order to test the transmission 
behaviour during emergency stops is addressed in [12]. A comparison of the behaviour of turbines 
with one rotor and with two rotors and gear transmissions was presented in [13], concluding that 
wind turbines with two rotors have increased performances in both steady and transient regimes.  
This paper addresses a comparative study of the behaviour of two wind turbines, proposed by the 
authors, with one rotor and two counter-rotating rotors, respectively, with identical electrical 
generators operating at the same running point and with the same planetary transmission type. The 
aspects comparatively analyzed refer to the parameters of wind rotors’ running points (torque and 
rotational speed), input mechanical power and transmission efficiency.  
Problem Formulation 
As previously stated, two equivalent wind turbines are considered in this comparative study:  
(a) a classical wind turbine with one rotor and an 1 DOF planetary increaser (Fig. 1a);  
(b) a counter-rotating wind turbine with two rotors and implicitly using a 2 DOF planetary increaser 
(Fig. 1b). The considered planetary transmission (Fig. 1c) contains cylindrical gears, where two 
serial satellite gears are used to enable a positive interior kinematic ratio, one output through the sun 
gear 1 and one input for the classical turbine (the carrier H, Fig.1a) or two inputs in the case of the 
counter-rotating turbine (the carrier H  and the sun gear 4, Fig.1b). The total number of the 
mechanism exterior links (inputs and outputs) is denoted by L. 
The nominal power of a wind turbine is given by the output power of the electric generator, 
dependent on the mechanical power used for driving the generator rotor: in steady-state conditions, 
the constant speed of the wind, the mechanical power parameters (torque T and angular speed ω) 
can be determined based on the mechanical characteristics of wind rotors (Tt = f(ωt)) and of 
generator (Tg = f(ωg)), typically linear functions with constant coefficients.

Based on the previously mentioned initial data, this study aims at identifying and comparing the 
behavior of two wind turbines operating in steady state by determining torques and angular speeds 
of the inputs and output respectively, considering two approaches: a) graphic-analytical method for 
reducing the mechanical characteristics of wind rotors at the output shaft; b) the analytical method 
for the direct calculation of the operating points (torques and angular speeds). 
The running point of the classical wind turbine 
The classical wind turbine contains one wind rotor and one generator with fixed stator, and thus the 
planetary increaser is a 1 DOF transmission obtained by blocking the ring gear (4 ≡ 0). Considering 
a representative numerical case study, the mechanical characteristics of the wind rotor and generator 
are both of linear type (Fig. 2) and have the equations:

running point of the generator is given by the intersection of the mechanical characteristics 
(Tg = ‒13 Nm, ωg = 120 rad/s) and the operating point of the wind rotor can be computed with Eqs. (3), 
(1) and (5) ): Tt = ‒182.3 Nm, ωt = ‒12 rad/s, resulting a mechanical power Pt = Tt ωt = 2187.6 W. As 
result, the wind turbine provides a mechanical power to the generator shaft Pg = Tg ωg = 1560 W.

The running point of the counter-rotating wind turbine 
In the case of counter-rotating turbines, the considered mechanical transmission operates as 2 DOF 
increaser, which implies its driving by two wind counter-rotating rotors fixed on the elements H and 4 
(Fig. 1). This 2 DOF planetary increaser requires input motions in opposite directions to get a summing 
motion at the output element 1; this property is ensured implicitly by the two wind rotors having opposite 
angles of the blades and therefore different directions of rotation under the wind action. 
To achieve the performance comparison of the two equivalent wind turbines, the same electric 
generator with the mechanical characteristic defined by Eq. (2), and the same operating point of the 
generator are considered. Consequently, the counter-rotating turbine includes two rotors with 
different mechanical characteristics, optimally determined to meet these requirements, as follows:

For the numeric example previously stated, the generator operating point can be graphically 
determined according to Fig. 3b (Tg = ‒13 Nm, ωg = 120 rad/s), which results in the following 
values of mechanical power parameters at the two rotors’ shafts: TH = ‒145 Nm, ωH = ‒3.2 rad/s,  
PH = TH ωH = 464 W, T4 = 158 Nm, ω4 = 8 rad/s, P4 = T4 ω4 = 1264 W.  
In the analytical approach, the operating point of the wind turbine results from solving the system

Results and conclusions  
The comparative analysis of the numerical results for the two equivalent wind turbines from the 
considered case study, in the assumption of using the same generator operating at the rated 
parameters, and the same mechanical transmission - used properly in the structural situations of 
1 DOF and 2 DOF planetary mechanism, the following statements can be outlined: 
- the conventional turbine (with one rotor) operates in the nominal regime with the wind rotor 
speed of 12 rad/s (114.6 rpm), while the counter-rotating turbine operates at lower rotors’ speeds, 
i.e. the rotational speed of the rotor 4 equals 8 rad/s (76.4 rpm), while the rotor H has 3.2 rad/s 
(30.6 rpm). The wind turbines operate at lower rotational speed for lower wind speeds and thus 
ensure a better exploitation of the wind potential, in many cases characterized by relatively low 
average values of the wind speed; 
- the needed torque on rotor shaft of the conventional turbine equals 182.3 Nm, about 15% higher 
than the torque on shaft 4 (the highest stressed element) of the counter-rotating turbine, with 
direct impact on wind turbine constructive parameters; 
Applied Mechanics and Materials Vol. 823

- the wind rotor of the classical turbine needs a mechanical power of 2187.9 W, while the counter-
rotating turbine requires approx. 58% of this for one of the rotors and about 21.2% for the second 
rotor.  As a result, the counter-rotating turbine solution uses more compact rotors and ensures 
higher efficiency of the mechanical power transmission (81.7% vs. 71.3% for conventional 
turbine), resulting in a relative increase of the efficiency of about 14.5%. 
In conclusion, the planetary transmissions used as 2 DOF speed increasers in the construction of 
counter-rotating wind turbines contribute to increasing the performance of wind energy conversion 
into electricity, compared to the functional case as 1 DOF planetary increaser typically included in 
the conventional turbines with one rotor. The paper contributions refer to novel solutions of two 
equivalent wind turbines with speed increaser, proposed by the authors, and a comparative method 
based on running point approach for identifying their features.

Abstract. The paper present two different methods for measuring flow in hydropower, one direct 
and one indirect method. The study consists in comparing the results obtained by measurements 
made by both methods in a Romanian hydropower plant. The indirect method used is the Winter-
Kennedy method. The other method involves direct measurement of the flow rate of water using a 
specialized outfit in this. 
Introduction 
Before and after the hydraulic turbine refurbishment or overhauls, on this are made a complete 
program of electrical and mechanical tests [1,2,3]. These tests are made for determining operating 
performance, including efficiency. One of the important measurements measured is the flow rate 
[4,5,6]. 
According to SR EN 60041:2003 [7], flow measurement for turbine reception must be realized 
by one direct method. Indirect methods, like Winter Kennedy, are conventionally used only for 
information and with the agreement of both sides, to verify power guarantee. This study trying to 
show that Winter Kennedy method has the same accuracy like direct methods, so it can be used also 
for turbine reception [8,9]. 
Depending on hydroelectric power, on his type (in dam or with forceful pipe), the flow rate can 
be measured by direct methods or indirect one [10]. Hydroelectric plant at which the measurements 
were carried out is a canal hydropower, with two hydro units, having 6 MW power either 
Winter Kennedy method is to determine the pressure difference between two intakes per spiral 
room [10]. The flow results as a form size: Q=k ⋅ ∆hn, where “∆h” is the pressure difference 
between the two intakes, and “n” theoretical is equal to 0,5. Winter-Kennedy method is applicable 
only to hydraulic turbines. 
Pressure intakes location was establish as shown in Fig.1. For measurements it is preferable to 
practice two pairs of intakes, as is shown in Fig.1. The outer intake 1 is placed at the outside of the 
spiral room, away from corners, the inner intake 2 being placed outside of the columns on a  power 
line located midway between two stator columns.  
A third intake, by reserve, can be practice on midway of stator column, profile location being in 
the point of maximum arrow. This third intake can also be practice on ceiling of spiral room 
between two stator columns. 
For measuring water flow  through  turbine, using direct method, was utilize a specialized 
ultrasonic plant type  Channel Master H-ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler), model 1200 
kHz by Teledine RD Instruments origin, shown in Fig.2.

Experimental results 
The measurements were made, using the described methods, for both hydropower plant units 
(HA1 respectively HA2), separately operating but also together, for the power values given in Table 
1. 
The flow was measured through its direct registration in time until the flow hydraulic regime 
became stable. 
In Table 1 are given the active Pa and reactive Pr power values and also the fall values Hnet, to 
which the samples were made.  In case of direct method determination of flow   QCM is the product 
of water flow rate vm and area A (cross-sectional area aria through which is measured the water 
flow), directly measured via experimental plant used.

Conclusions 
From the made study can be conclude: 
from the six sets of measurements performed, at first four  the difference between the flows, 
obtained through both methods, fall in the range of ± 1%; 
the biggest measured flow difference appears in case of simultaneously operating of the two units 
of hydropower plant, charged to a nominal power of 
MW
P

=
; this difference fall in the range of  
±1,5%; 
the both measurement methods fall into the same accuracy class, higher values of measured flow 
being obtained, random, or by the direct method, or by the indirect one; 
accuracies obtained are very good for measurements in hydropower plant.

Keywords: counter-rotating, planetary gearbox, speed increaser, kinematics, efficiency, wind

Abstract. The counter-rotating wind turbine is a relatively new concept of wind converter that 
contains two rotors placed on the same side or on both sides of the nacelle with the aim of 
increasing the wind energy conversion efficiency. As the rotors are rotating at a lower speed than 
the generator requires, the wind turbine usually contains a speed increaser to harmonize their 
running regimes. Similar counter-rotating systems are approached for hydro applications but they 
are still in the research phase. The paper proposes a novel concept of a 2 DOF (degrees of freedom) 
speed increaser to be used in counter-rotating systems (wind or hydro). The structural and kinematic 
features of the 1 DOF and 2 DOF transmission running cases are presented in the paper. The 
differential transmission is further analyzed and the transmission functions and efficiency are 
established. Finally, conclusions regarding the use of 2 DOF transmissions in the renewable energy 
systems are formulated.  
Introduction 
Nowadays, humanity is more and more dependent on energy. So far, the fossil fuels offer the main 
part of this energy. However, these resources are limited and have a high impact on the human 
habitat. Therefore, the humanity is facing a real challenge in gradually replacing the conventional 
energy by other sources that do not jeopardize the environment. This need has pushed the 
researchers and companies to develop systems to capture the renewable energy. Among them, the 
wind turbines and the small hydropower plants are very attractive for practical applications in 
sustainable communities. A large number of wind and hydro converters of different types were 
developed, some of these ingenious concepts being still in the research phase. These systems are 
mainly designed with the aim of increasing the efficiency of the wind / water energy conversion. 
One solution developed in the last years is the counter-rotating wind turbine [1] that improves the 
conversion efficiency of the wind energy into electrical energy up to 20% compared to conventional 
turbines. The wind turbine contains two rotors mounted on the same side or on both sides of the 
nacelle [2,3]. As the rotors are rotating with a lower speed than the electric generator requires, the 
system can make use of a speed increaser to harmonize the components’ running regimes. The 
counter-rotating hydro system is still in the research phase. 
Usually, the speed increasers used in the renewable energy systems are either belt transmissions 
(hydropower plant), parallel-shaft gears or planetary gearboxes (wind turbines, hydropower plants). 
The planetary gearboxes are light and compact, but have a higher complexity than the other 
transmissions [4,5,6]. Most of the gearboxes used in renewable energy systems are 1 DOF 
transmissions, with one input (the rotor/turbine) and one output (the electric generator). For 
example, the gearboxes of the counter-rotating wind turbines usually contain a combination of 
planetary, spur and bevel gears [7,8].   
The paper proposes a novel 2 DOF speed increaser to be used in counter-rotating renewable 
energy systems with coaxial rotors / turbines [9]. The transmission running cases are detailed and 
the kinematic parameters are established for each case. The kinematic features and efficiency of the

2 DOF transmission are further presented. Finally, the results are analyzed in order to formulate 
conclusions and recommendations of this transmission type implementation in renewable energy 
systems.   
 Structural and Kinematic Features 
The counter-rotating transmission from Fig. 1 runs based on the 2 DOF planetary gear property of 
summing two input motions into an output motion. It contains two sun gears 1 and 4, a carrier H 
and two satellite gears 2 and 3.  Thus, the system will have coaxial rotors / turbines, connected 
through the planetary gear with two inputs (the two rotors / water turbines) and one output (the 
generator) [10, 11].

of freedom. The 1 DOF and 2 DOF running cases are presented in Table 1 by block diagrams with L

Case Study: the 2 DOF Transmission Synthesis 
The transmission can be dimensioned according to the application, by selecting the running case, 
assigning the input(s) and output, establishing the kinematic ratio(s) and efficiency, and performing the 
geometric synthesis. Thus, the kinematics and efficiency of the 2 DOF transmission with input 
elements H and 4, and 1 output (element 1) are further detailed as a first step in the speed increaser 
dimensioning. In this case, the absolute value and direction of the output angular speed ω1 can be 
graphically established in relation with the known input angular speeds ωH and ω4, based on Fig. 2:

Results and Conclusions 
The use of a 2 DOF planetary gear as speed increaser in a counter-rotating renewable energy system 
is accompanied by the following advantages:  
- it allows using lighter and smaller rotors / water turbines to get the same amount of energy as 
a conventional system;  
- it is recommended to be used in small systems for the built environment due to their compact 
design; 
- the system is more balanced compared to those using a single row of blades. 
The dimensioning of the 2 DOF speed increaser covers aspects like: assignation of input and 
output shafts, establishment of the multiplication ratios according to water turbines / wind rotors’ 
speeds, geometric synthesis.  
The selection of inputs/output shafts and dimensioning of speed increaser for a specific counter-
rotating application (hydropower plant, wind turbine) can be practical approached based on 
diagrams, as the ones presented in Fig. 3; the numerical results from Fig. 3 allow highlighting that: 
- the transmission kinematic ratios i4H, i1H and the efficiency are increasing with the increasing 
of  interior kinematic ratio i0;  
Applied Mechanics and Materials Vol. 823

- the absolute values of the multiplication ratios i4H and i1H are decreasing with the increase of 
i14, for values higher than i0;.  
- the values of the multiplication ratios i4H and i1H are increasing with the increase of i14, for 
values lower than i0; 
- the efficiency is decreasing with the increase of i14; 
The use of the 2 DOF speed increaser between the rotors / turbines and the generator allows the 
good functioning of the three components at higher efficiencies. Moreover, the counter-rotating 
transmission allows increasing the amount of energy produced by the renewable energy system 
compared to the existing solutions.

Abstract. The paper presents a method for obtaining the power of thermal source, based on finite 
element approach, when the temperature distribution is known from an infrared image. The method 
is solving for the load vector, and extracts the power at element level from this vector. 
Introduction 
The matrix formulation of heat transfer, used in finite element analysis, has the global form from 
Eq. 1, where: [K] is the conductivity matrix, [Q] is the load vector, and [T] is the vector which 
contains the nodal temperature from finite element mesh. In direct problem the [K] matrix and [Q] 
vector contains the input data, and the [T] vector hosts the unknown from the equation system.

In inverse problem of heat transfer we have the input data in [K] matrix and [T] vector (where 
the temperature distribution can be derived from an infrared image), and the unknown is actually the 
[Q] vector, so we can determine which is the thermal load which produced the previous temperature 
distribution. This approach is useful to derive relations for thermal source at element level, in 
different engineering applications, such as a cutting process. 
Inverse problem approach 
In both situations, (direct and inverse problem), the conductivity matrix [K] is built in the same 
way: assembling the elemental matrixes, who-se elements depends on nodal coordinates and 
conduction coefficient. At these expressions, convection and radiation boundary conditions must be 
added, as presented in [1,2].  
In inverse problem if the boundary conditions are realistic, the nodal temperatures definitely must 
verify the equation system, so the [T] vector is filled with the nodal temperature measured with an 
infrared camera, as presented in [3,4]. In this way we can derive directly the [Q] vector, so called 
the load vector, by multiplying the previous matrix and vector, which in this case are the unknown. 
The goal of this study is to extract from the [Q] vector the internal sources at element level, 
separating the other terms which can be added: Cauchy, convection and radiation boundary 
conditions, as presented in [4]. Introducing the correct boundary conditions is mandatory, because 
otherwise the determinant of [K] matrix is null, so the system can’t be solved. 
The process is based on Eq. 2, derived from [1,5], where:

Where: matrix [V] is the type of m x n (with m: number of nodes involved in defining elements 
with internal source, n: number of elements with internal source); [L] is the vector which contains 
finally the unknown – power of thermal source at element level; [Q1] is the vector composed with 
elements from [Q] vector of global system (only the ones with nodes involved in elements with 
thermal source). The elements vij of matrix [V] are defined by Eq. 5:

In the above Eq. 3 we can fill the [V] matrix and the [Q1] vector, solving so for the [L] vector 
with Gauss method. In this system if the number of nodes m is bigger than the number of elements 
n, we can eliminate few equations, just to make the matrix [V] a square one (in this case the 
solutions obtained must be inserted in the original system to check the eliminated equations). 
Study case 
This method was applied to derive the power of thermal source in a turning process. The mesh is 
presented in Fig. 1, and the definition of elements with thermal source is described in Table 1. The 
mesh is corresponding to the top surface of Kennametal MDJNR-2525K tool with KC 990, KC 950 
tips. We have used a planar model due to the fact that the thermal source is located at the surface of 
the tip, where the chip is detached from the work piece and is sliding along that area. The 
coordinates of nodes are mobile, depending on the cutting deep and material. 
The elements used are orthotropic triangular ones, and the infrared images used for the 
temperature distribution are selected from steady the state phase of phenomena.

In these circumstances the Eq. 3 looks like Eq. 6, where the number of nodes is 8, and the 
number of elements is 6, so we must to eliminate 2 equations.

One of the variants that produces a nonsingular [V] matrix is keeping the nodes 13, 18, 19, 20,

checking the solutions in the eliminated ones, is fully automatic, being introduced into a special

Conclusions 
Briefly we can summarize our method to the following steps: 
• Reading the data mesh and building the [K] matrix at element level, adding the 
convection, radiation and heat flow boundary conditions; 
• Assembling the global matrix and saving the columns from global [K] matrix which will 
be affected by Dirichlet boundary conditions; 
• Applying the Dirichlet boundary conditions and evaluating the [Q] vector; 
• Reconstructing the initial [Q] vector before applying boundary conditions with the values 
saved before; 
• Marking the elements with internal thermal source; 
• Building a nonsingular [V] matrix, and building the [Q1] vector; 
• Solving for [L] vector and checking the solutions in the eliminated equations. 
The method produces accurate values of thermal source in a turning process, expressed in 
[W/mm2]. These values, obtained for different combinations of cutting parameters and materials, 
can be used to derive relations based on a statistical approach, useful in a direct heat transfer 
problem, where the values for thermal source are difficult to estimate.

Abstract. This paper describes the behavior of adaptive control using the MIT rule for a polar 
aligned single axis tracking system, it´s for increase the efficiency of solar energy capturing 
compared to a polar fixed system, where the response of system is analyzed by simulation in 
Simulink – MATLAB® software. The data input for estimate the energy in the photovoltaic panels 
is the radiation data, that is obtained by weather station of the CAR (regional autonomous 
corporation) situated in the zone of study. The objective of the integration between the photovoltaic 
panel and the mechanics tracking system is to keep the perpendicular sunlight during the day. The 
MIT adaptive control tries to reduce possible errors, such a sun position data deviations, friction and 
environmental changes in the conventional solar tracking. This control was designed according to a 
typical polar aligned single axis tracker. 
Introduction 
Actually, the development of energy capturing methods is framed by studies such as new 
materials creation, that depending on their physicochemical properties increase the voltage 
generation by energy transformation acting within the panel, until energy capturing method based 
on designs of solar trackers, which increase the incidence of solar radiation on the panel [1, 2, 3] 
Among this field, active solar tracking systems differ according to their control systems. A first 
example is the technique developed by [4], which uses a microcontroller, two motor control 
modules, two DC motors and a pyranometer among other components. Its algorithm is based on a 
differential control. However, the method implemented by [5], is a fuzzy controller for a system that 
allows solar tracking over two axis. 
However in this controllers are present many errors that can destabilize the system, and lose 
solar energy capturing. The adaptive control can modify your parameters to adapt to a changing 
environment. The changes in environment can represent variations in process dynamics or changes 
in the characteristics of the disturbances [6]. 
Control Algorithms  
The controller proposed by [4], first establishes the system's "HOME", and then takes the GPS 
information to calculate sunrise and sunset times. Solar present time is compared to the times of 
sunrise and sunset to determine whether to start or stop monitoring. At night, we wait until the next 
sampling time. Between sunset and sunrise, the value of the pyranometer is read to check whether 
there is enough solar radiation to generate power. Otherwise, the system remains in its current 
position while solar radiation rises to the lower limit of solar radiation. After the solar radiation 
reaches the desired value, then the algorithm reads the value of the anemometer to determine 
whether the system can move safely, if not, the follower remains in "HOME" for at least one 
sampling time. The tracking system from [5], consists of a solar panel which is displaced by two 
motors, four sensors which calculate solar radiation in strategic areas of study, according to the

measured value of each one, the driver delivers an adjustment signal to the system. The controller is 
divided into three processes: 
1. Fuzzification: Calculation of the grade of membership of each input to the linguistic terms of 
fuzzy sets [7, 8]. 
2. Inference Engine Rules: These heuristic rules of form IF (antecedent) THEN (consistent), 
where the antecedent and consequent are also fuzzy sets, either pure or result of operating with 
them [9, 10]. 
3. Defuzzification: Calculation of the output according to the fuzzy value set by the rules [11]. 
MIT Rule 
“The MIT rule is the original approach to model- reference adaptive control” [12], was first 
developed in 1960 by the Instrumentation Laboratory (now the Draper Laboratory) at MIT. The 
MIT rule considered a closed-loop system in which the controller has one adjustable parameter Ɵ. 
The desired closed-loop response is specified by a model whose output is Ym. Let e be the error 
between the output Y of the closed-loop system and the output Ym of the model. One possibility is 
to adjust Ɵ parameter in such a way that the loss function is minimized. 
Ɵ =

To make J small, it is reasonable to change the parameter in the direction of the negative gradient 
of J, that is: [13, 14, 15].

The partial derivative 	/Ɵ , which is called the sensitivity derivative of the system, and 
indicates how the error is changing with respect to the parameter θ. 
Assume that the process is linear with transfer function kG(s), where k is an unknown parameter 
and G(s) is a known transfer function. The goal is to design a controller so that our process could 
track the reference model with transfer function Gm(s) = koG(s), where ko is a known parameter so:

Where u is the control signal and uc the command signal, the transfer function relating the control

Using the MIT rule is obtained a method for adjusting the parameter Ɵ. The error is

Model of the solar position 
The calculation of the projection diurnal angle of radiation is achievable by spatial location 
specified by latitude, the corresponding day of the year and time of day. In Fig 1, the projection of 
diurnal angle for a day is observed at approximately corresponding latitude of 4.94, the curve that is 
taken for the study is on the range (5-18) hours because they represent the incidence of the sun as a 
source of energy, this data was provided by the CAR (regional autonomous corporation) and its 
approach as a fourth order polynomial having the following function:

Adaptive Control 
Obtained the model which describes the apparent solar trajectory for one day, it is include among 
the control structure as shown in Fig 2 like the “Reference Model ". 
 
Fig 2 Adaptive control scheme 
The tracking system response produced by the control signal of this controller in three days can 
be seen in Fig 3. The adaptation and adjustment process in response follower can be deduced by 
comparing the dynamics of each day. It is noted that for the second day tracking the reference 
model is more accurate, we can deduce that from this day (day 2) the controller is able to produce a 
control signal that adjusts the guidance system for the follow with high precision in its linear range 
and for the case where reference is reset controller generates a signal to produce a smooth and slow 
response.

The relationship between the mechanical dynamic and dynamics of the photovoltaic panel, for 
energy production is shown in Fig 5 where Ɵ is the  angle having the orientation system, Rs is 
radiation provided by the sun, α is the diurnal angle, RT  is radiation entering the photovoltaic panel 
and  i, current produced by him. It is observed that the radiation entering on the panel, is directly 
influenced by the difference in angles between the orientation system and the diurnal angle at which 
the radiation produced by the sun, the control ensures that this error is zero or minimum for 
maximum concentration solar energy with a  typical polar aligned single axis tracker.

Conclusion 
The adaptive control implemented allows increase the conversion of solar energy into electrical 
energy, which is useful for human consumption maintaining the normal orientation of solar panel, 
coincident with the direction of instant radiation solar, because it is the only variable that can be 
changed in the system. After analyzing the adaptive control performance, it’s possible to determine 
the adaptability factor, which is a variable that influences largely on the control system stability. 
The disadvantage on the control method is absence of theoretical criteria to determine and select the 
adaptability factor, the unique criteria is to keep it low. Taking into account the results of the second 
day of execution of the controller (see Fig 3), was obtained that the solar tracking system follows 
the reference model even though it is modeled as a piecewise function, improving the monitoring of 
the solar path, raising efficiency in attracting charge to 98% with adaptability factor equal to 0.0004 
without considering the losses by the execution of control. According to the results, the 
performance was improved regarding the adaptive control system in terms of % efficiency, 
compared to a static polar system with 81% of efficiency. It demonstrates an improvement of 10% 
using an adaptive control for the solar tracking system.

Abstract. This paper shows the design and implementation of a neural network using back 
propagation method in order to perform the tracking of the maximum power point of a solar panel; 
this can be achieved by the use of the predictive ability of the network which uses light sensors to 
perform angular movement of the panel to find the optimum position all of this with the use of C# 
software. Tests were performed both in artificial and real environments; the network tracking 
sensitivity was tested in the artificial environment and it gave a result of less than 8 degrees of error, 
on the other hand  in terms of voltage an improvement of more than 25% was found on the tracking 
configuration against a static configuration. As for the real environment testing, the tracking 
achieved to find the value of maximum power with a difference smaller than 4% of the maximum 
power measurement obtained. 
Introduction 
Renewable energy is a major topic of discussion worldwide, but in order to consider its proper 
use it is necessary to maximize its potential. Solar energy by using solar panels is a powerful 
alternative that can be implemented in almost any environment and the search for its appropriate 
use has generated a lot of optimization algorithms, in that context is where we can talk about the 
role of the artificial intelligence as a way to approach this problematic. 
Some popular algorithms used are those with predictive capabilities as mentioned in the article 
[1] in which the authors combine the use of artificial neural networks by the back propagation and 
radial basis methods, at first the mathematical model of the solar panel is found by tracking data of 
real panels as inputs of the neural network, then with the use of climate data history the network 
must find the maximum power point, another use of neural networks is mentioned in [2] in which it 
must meet the demands of a solar building, by using a weather module the network obtains its 
entries represented as the following data: room temperature, solar radiation, heating energy and 
temperature inside the module to predict the location where the peak power is obtained. 
Fuzzy control and incremental conductance are another type of algorithms as mentioned in [3] 
where a fuzzy controller whose rules are directly dependent on the variations obtained in the boost 
converter and the panel. This directly reflect the change in temperature and intensity of the sun in 
the atmosphere, on the other side in [4] the authors referred to the incremental conductance 
algorithm which seeks to find the point where the derivative of the graphic of  power vs. voltage of 
a panel is zero, both algorithms were tested in an artificial environment simulation. 
Based on the current developments a neural network by the back propagation method will be 
used in this project because of its predictive capabilities and its stability against possible data 
corruption and it will be complemented by the use of a mechanical section; this method of tracking 
seeks to be implemented and accessible in most part of the world for this reason the inputs of the 
network will be light sensors (LDR) in which the network must be capable of perform the tracking 
of the sun in order to find the maximum power point of the panel; each sensor is represented by Sx

where x refers to the specific number of one of the six implemented on the prototype sensors as 
showed in the Fig 1.  
 
 
Fig 1. LDR distribution 
The location of each LDR was selected in this way because the panel must have a 180 ° range of 
measurement that is divided into 3 sections; the right, middle and left side in which the network will 
be trained in order to keep the panel in the middle sector of measurement. 
For a proper use of solar energy it is necessary for the solar panel to work at any time in its 
maximum power point (MPP) as described in [5], this value depends on factors such as temperature 
and solar radiation based on that the problem question is: Could a neural network by back 
propagation method and by using differential light inputs ensure a proper tracking of the sun in 
order to bring the panel to its maximum power point?, as indicated in the question the basic concept 
of this project is to develop a neural network by back propagation method that by using sensors 
(LDR) as inputs is able to learn to perform the tracking of the maximum power point of a solar 
panel. 
The objectives needed to fulfill the requirements of the work the main one of them is to design 
and implement a neural network which by the use of the back propagation method and light sensing 
as inputs achieve to make the tracking of the maximum power point of a solar panel, six more 
objectives (secondary objectives) are derived from the main one that punctually highlight technical 
aspects like achieving a soft movement of the panel that must be 100% dependent of the network´s 
behavior, in terms of accuracy the tracking of the light must find the goal value with no more than 8 
degrees of difference, by the other hand the prototype must be able to perform a 25% improvement 
with the tracking configuration against the static configuration, in which the panel will not be 
affected by any source of movement. 
Once the prototype have been successfully tested under artificial conditions it must fulfill the 
secondary objectives under real conditions, this objectives demand the network to find the 
maximum power point with les that 8% of error in comparison with the real maximum power point 
that the panel can provide, at the same time the network must be capable of respond even if one of 
the sensor´s data is receiving wrong information.   
The development of this paper is divided into 4 chapters whose contents are set out below: In the 
first chapter the developments made on solar energy and solar panels were addressed from the 
standpoint of artificial intelligence and some algorithms as incremental conductance, the second 
chapter define the problem and justify the implementation of the work, the third chapter will select 
and implement the design methodology used for the development of the prototype and finally the 
fourth chapter presents how the prototype responds to the implementation of the tests addressed in 
the methodology section of the document.

Methodology and design 
The prototype development was performed according to the following methodology: The training of 
the network was made taking into account the optimal use of the following components: number of 
inputs (depends on the number of LDR), number of training patterns, number of neurons in the 
hidden layer, number of outputs and training coefficient based on [6] and the activation function 
based on [7], this is the final architecture of the network: number of inputs: 6, number of training 
patterns: 10, number of neurons in the hidden layer: 8, number of outputs: 1, training coefficient: 3, 
activation function: unipolar sigmoid. once the network is trained the mechanical design that best 
suits the project is selected by the use of the QFD matrix [8] that enables to find the best alternative 
of design, can see in the Fig. 2, once selected, it is possible to proceed to find the actuator and every 
mechanical aspect that fits the selected design. Having in mind the results of the mathematical 
model of the mechanical section the next step is to design the electrical parts in which every 
component that allow the communication between the sensing of the mechanical part with the 
network and the network with the actuator was chosen. 
 
Fig 2. Selected mechanical model 
The torque required to move the base of the mechanical section is represente by Eq. 1: 
 =  0.34 	 ∗ 9.8 /  ∗ 0.06 =  0.2  
 
   
 
                 (1) 
 
In which 0.32 Kg is the weight of the mechanical section, 9.8 / is the gravity and 0.06 m 
represents the distance between the force and the rotation point. The selected actuator has an exit 
torque of 0.203 Nm  which is very close to the desired value, for this reason a set of gears are 
implemented with a 3:1 ratio, taking into account a 40% gear transmission loss  the real torque 
implemented by the actuator and the set of gears is 0.3654 Nm. Having in mind the results of the 
mathematical model of the mechanical section the next step is to design the electrical parts in which 
every component that allow the communication between the sensing of the mechanical part with the 
network and the network with the actuator was chosen. 
 
The following tests were made in order to check the synergy of the whole model. The prototype will 
be exposed to an artificial environment and a real environment, firstly tests were performed in 
artificial environment where the sensitivity of the prototype to light variations is measured and also 
how it affects the voltage measurement of the panel, having this results another test was performed 
in both of the environments, the idea is to compare the  results of the tracking system with the real 
value of the maximum power point of the panel, at first it was necessary to take measurements on 
an specific time in an specific day this data shows the response in voltage, current and power of the 
panel starting at 0° (with respect to the horizontal) and slowly increasing its measurement angle 
until it reaches 180°, based on the previous data the tracking configuration was implemented in 
order to compare its results with the maximum value of power obtained with the collected data, this 
is the last implemented test that allow the prototype to present its training results and it is performed 
at the same way in artificial and real (cloudy and cloudless) environment.

Performance 
Artificial Environment: At this test the angle of the focus of the artificial light was continuously 
varied from 0° to 180°, the mechanical part of the prototype was set to its static and tracking 
configurations in order to see the difference between both behaviors as shown in Fig. 3 (the angle of 
the static configuration in which the panel was pointing is not relevant in the case of an artificial 
environment and was set to 60°).  
 
Fig.3. Artificial response of the prototype 
The tracking configuration manage to perform an improvement of more than 40% in its 
measurements giving an average of 12.68 Voc compared to 8.7 Voc of the static results, as shown 
above the experimental static data results corresponds to the angle variation of the artificial light, 
60° refers to the direct light insertion to the panel and the other data represents the panel response to 
the artificial light variation. 
 
The following data summarize the response of the prototype when exposed to both artificial and 
real environments, as seen the obtained current, voltage and power in yellow highlight are the 
results of the tracking implementation. The tables also show the results obtained by varying the 
angular position of the panel 180°, being the idea that the tracking result must be as close as 
possible to the highest power measurement data in angular position variation. Below in Table 1 are 
the results of the artificial environment as so as the real environment with varying weather 
conditions.

As shown in Table 1, the point of maximum luminescence thrown by the tracking of the network in 
an artificial environment corresponds to a power of 22.563mW, this data is similar to the maximum 
power point of the data obtained by varying the angular position of the panel.  
Also the peak power data obtained in the real environment correspond to 170.2mW and 2.387W for 
cloudy and cloudless sky respectively, these data compared with the results obtained by the tracking

configuration (168mW and 2.312W) match the data of the maximum power point provided by the 
panel at the selected hours of the day giving us a difference less than 4%. 
Each of the collected data that belongs to the network and the mechanical section are displayed in 
an organized interface so that the user can identify the graphs of the inputs and outputs of the 
network, the position of the panel and the real measurement of the sensors and shown in Fig. 4, the 
interface is allowed to communicate with the mechanical section because of the implementation of a 
microcontroller and a power driver.

Conclusions 
The neural network managed to track the maximum power point in cloudless sky with a difference 
of 70mW equivalent to 4% compared to the real power measurement. 
The result of the artificial tracking allows the panel monitoring the light with a variation no greater 
than ±5° after the test performed.  
Artificial dynamic configuration performs better with regard to artificial static configuration since 
data show a 45% improvement in levels of voltage. 
The final selected network architecture allowed continuing monitoring even when one of its sensors 
sends the wrong data 0. 
The neural network based control enabled smooth movement of the prototype because an 
appropriate selection process implementing the correct number of neurons by cover a wide range of 
data which thanks of the microcontroller are received as actuator move instruction. 
The C# software where the interface was conducted achieved the desire set requirements, speed 
transmission/reception enabled the network to communicate with the actuator; in terms of plotting 
variables the interface didn’t confuse the reached data visualizing the data in real time of the 
network relevant components and the sensing.

Abstract. The constant evolution of the energy industry, has introduced the need for ongoing 
research studies about climate change due to its direct action on the production of alternative 
energies. Thus, they have focused on developing predictive algorithms in order to resolve, in an 
early way, the climate action on each point of energy production. In the development of this work, 
the ANFIS algorithm and information from the NASA Langley research center virtual database 
were implemented. They being oriented to the analysis and prediction of solar radiation over the 
geographic area of the Nueva Granada Military University campus in Cajicá, Colombia, with the 
purpose of making appropriate use of the power generating system located in the zone. The 
development of such systems, would allow the early identification of solar radiation that can be 
present in different geographical areas of Colombia, in order to provide the necessary power to 
cover the electricity demand required in each region, achieving as results an approximation error 
less than 1%.  
Introduction 
In the energy industry, research has been focused on methodologies that allows the appropriate 
and greater use of environmental resources, such as solar radiation, air or water currents and 
temperature changes. Where the benefit of using these variables lies in presenting alternate energy 
systems that enable the consumer to receive the needed power supply and at the same time, reduce 
the agents responsible for harming the environment and the health of human beings. Still, it is clear 
that by taking in consideration the climate changes, [1, 2, 3], it is necessary to develop 
methodologies that that allow the energy industry analyze their effects on the behavior of the 
installed energy systems [4]. 
Among types of energy that are being studied in this field of investigation, seawater air 
conditioning and ocean thermal energy conversion [5], as well as wind, solar, geothermal [6] and 
hydropower [7] energy can be mentioned. With these techniques, different applications have been 
developed. Such as electric vehicles that do not need extra power [8, 9] or hybrid houses that 
decrease energy costs for less affordable users [10, 11]. 
By identifying the changes in solar radiation due to the continuing climatic variation on the 
planet [1] as the main issue, predictive algorithms that obtain the values of radiation have been 
developed. With these values, energy systems with the capability of supplying the energy demand 
by taking advantage of these predictions can be created [12, 13]. 
One example of prediction algorithms is the probabilistic distribution function, which makes the 
solar radiation prediction by taking in consideration the clearness index [4]. Another technique, 
adjusted to serve as a prediction algorithm is the vector machine, which considers the minimum 
temperature, maximum temperature and sunshine [2, 14, 15]. 
Likewise, techniques that involves numerical analysis are being used by taking into account 
climate variations, which allows to identify the index of cloudiness and solar radiation attenuation 
[16]. Finally, the ANFIS structure and the coral reefs technique, with the capability to receive three 
types of inputs in order to simulate solar radiation [17, 18].  
The management of the new alternative energies, may eventually allow the reduction of global 
warming, carbon dioxide emissions and as well, prevent the growth of the cost of gasoline or coal

based fuel [19]. Favoring the consumer regardless of location or economic status [3], taking into 
account the policies developed to implement these systems as initiatives [6]. 
This paper presents an algorithm for predicting solar radiation using the ANFIS theory. Initially, 
the recognition of variables that can alter the incidence of solar radiation on the surface of the earth 
was made. Among which the wind speed, the varying density of clouds in the sky, temperature, 
humidity and rainfall were considered. 
After recognizing the variables with the greatest impact on energy generation, a procedure to 
develop the prediction algorithm with the ANFIS structure was implemented, indicating the 
membership function and the amount of data to be used for both training and validation. 
With the generation of these centralized systems of alternative energy, the energetic demand can 
be supplied. Generating both environmental and economic benefits by creating a Smart Grid to 
encourage technological and economic growth for developing countries [20, 21]. Likewise, the 
research progress in such algorithms would help human skin studies to avoid possible damage from 
radiation and prevent potential risks from cancer [22]. 
 
Methodology 
 
Before conducting the prediction algorithm, the identification of variables which act indirectly 
on the behavior of solar radiation (Wh/m2/day) was made. 
Among the variables identified in the area corresponding to the campus of Nueva Granada 
Military University located in Cajicá, Cundinamarca, Colombia with latitude: 4.9419836 and 
longitude: -74.0135591, were the wind speed (m/s), Temperature (°C), Rainfall (mm3) and relative 
humidity (%) [23]. this data corresponds to each of the variables obtained from the NASA Langley 
research center database in a period no longer than 14 years. The methodology is presented in Fig. 1 
[24]. 
 
 
Fig. 1. Methodology for predicting solar radiation using the ANFIS algorithm 
 
The behavior of the previously mentioned variables is considered of non – linear character, 
where algorithms such as ANFIS, help analyze them due to their inaccurate nature [25] and allows 
to make decisions according to heuristic rules set to neural networks, due their ability to learn, 
adapt, and capability of parallelism and generalization [26]. 
 
Prediction of solar radiation by ANFIS. After solving the variables that can affect the behavior 
of solar radiation on the surface of the earth, the following step is to develop the ANFIS algorithm 
with the MATLAB platform, using the genfis1, anfis y evalfis tools, as can be seen in the Fig. 2.

At the third layer, the results of the membership functions were related to the Sugeno type rule. 
In layer 4, the defuzzification process was made using the integration method known as Weighted 
Average (wtaver), which corresponds to a Sugeno type fuzzy inference. The objective of this 
process, is to obtain a simple linear or constant output (Of) in the fifth layer, calculated using Eq. 1, 
where ωi, are the values of the weights and zi is the output of every rule [27]. The final data was 
taken as the value to determine the error in order to continue with the proper adjustment of the 
rules.

This structure is arranged with an input layer, which sets a vector for each of the variables that 
act directly on solar radiation. In the second layer, the bell type membership function (gbellmf)

To make the prediction process, the data for the training procedure were taken from 1997 to 
2012. Organizing the first 14 years as the network input and the final year as the output. In order to 
make the information related to previous years correspond with the most current data. 
The training process begins with the setting of the background parameters with the downward 
gradient and the consequents with the least squares algorithm, adding a stage of trial and error to 
provide a proper functioning [26]. This methodology, allows making a hybrid learning, in order to 
achieve the desired iterations until the mean square error approaches the desired error. 
 
Results 
 
After conducting the training stage and obtaining the desired results to predict the year 2012, the 
next step was to perform the validation stage. This stage consist initially in taking the trained neural 
network, having as input the data corresponding to the prior year of the desired one. In this case, the 
prediction for the year 2013 is made by taking as input the data of the year 2012. 
To get a better appreciation of the results Eq. 3 is implemented, which corresponds to the 
standard deviation. Where N is the number of values in the equation that performs the comparison 
between the resulting data and desired ones.

Achieving, for the process of training, a standard deviation of 0.00648 and an average error of -
0.0034, equivalent to a number of success of 360 / 366. After finding  these values, the following 
step was to perform the prediction stage for the year 2013 from data obtained in the year 2012, 
achieving a number of success equal to 270/366, with a standard deviation of 4.69 and an average 
error -0.12, as can be seen in Fig. 4 and  Fig. 5

Conclusions 
 
By taking into account the concept of ANFIS adjusted to the prediction of solar radiation, the 
desired performance compared to traditional methods of prediction was obtained. These variations 
were compared taking in consideration the time as a reference to follow and as disturbance rejection 
with a desired stability, achieving a match with the antecedent and consequent parameters set as an 
objective of the ANFIS algorithm tuning. 
Likewise, with the identification of environmental variables involved in the reduction of solar 
irradiation on the surface of the earth, the capability to analyze ad build such nonlinear systems 
similar to their real counterparts becomes possible. 
Finally, it is necessary to consider continuing with prediction studies, in order to propose an 
algorithm that has the potential to reduce the error between the expected and desired values. 
Achieving a methodology that allows building a power generating system that evade possible 
affections to the production system.

Abstract. The paper presents a method developed and used by the CCHAPT researchers for the 
graphic plotting of the index tests results for hydraulic turbines, the comparison of the efficiency curves 
resulted from testing to those obtained by the model transposition [1] i.e. the determination and 
comparison of the existing combinatory cam with that obtained from tests.   
The method presented in the paper was born from the need for processing and presenting the results of 
index tests within the shortest delay and eliminating the errors that might occur in the results plotting.   
Introduction 
When a hydro unit is commissioned, before and after the refurbishment works, it is subjected to a set 
of tests to quantify both the efficiency gain and electric power produced, as well as its general 
condition. One of the most important dimensions measured during these tests is the discharge. There 
are several methods for measuring the debit at hydraulic turbines, but most of them require expensive, 
lengthy measurements and they block the hydro unit exploitation for a period of time unfavourable for 
the beneficiaries. The simplest and most efficient methods from the economical point of view for flow 
measurement, currently used in the field, is the Winter – Kennedy method [2, 3, 4]. 
The index tests, as defined in [5], represent the totality of tests performed in the hydro electro power 
plant on the hydro unit for determining the flow and efficiency as relative dimensions (the Winter-
Kennedy method [2]), and are used on the commissioning of a hydro unit or after a capital repair and 
are performed by specialised personnel with high-precision measuring tools. Beside flow and 
efficiency, within the index tests, at the beneficiary’s request one may also check the combinatory link 
implemented in the hydro unit governor.   
The paper presents the way this method was used for the graphic plotting of the index tests, the 
determination of the combinatory link resulted from the tests and the comparison with the implemented 
link and that resulted from the model transposition, tests performed on a 19.5 MW Kaplan turbine. 
Index tests on hydraulic turbines  
Theoretic considerations. As defined according to [5], an index value is an arbitrary value, 
measured with non-gauged instruments with primary methods. For instance, the index efficiency is 
calculated from the specific hydraulic energy, power and debit, measured with non-gauged tools by 
primary methods.   
For the double-adjust turbines the index tests procedure for a head requires two sets of 
measurements: measurements on cam and measurement outside the combinatory cam.  
The cam measurements start from minimum power and progress to maximum power, and are 
performed in minimum 5 points, with equal power steps.

The measurements outside the cam preferably start from the maximum power, for a preset number 
of angular positions of runner blades. The measuring procedure is graphically illustrated in [6] and 
described in detail in [7]. 
Actually, in most cases, the start point on the cam does not correspond to the maximum efficiency 
point on the helicoidal curve determined from index tests, and the optimum cam point for the 
prescribed runner blades opening.   
For a better understanding of the problem, the article will present the graphic results of the index 
tests obtained on a 19.5 MW Kaplan turbine for a measured head. 
Index tests performed on a 19.5 MW Kaplan turbine. The index tests presented below were 
performed for the verification of the unit condition after capital repairs.  
The turbine technical data subjected to testing are:  
- 
maximum power at maximum net head: 19.5 MW; 
- 
nominal number of revolutions: 93.75 rpm; 
- 
maximum net head: 14 m; 
- 
net head: 13.25 m; 
- 
minimum net head: 11 m; 
- 
maximum discharge: 156 m3/s. 
In order to determine flow and efficiency, one measured the following dimensions: 
- 
upstream level after grate; 
- 
downstream level at the exit from turbine; 
- 
pressure gap on Winter-Kennedy taps on the spiral chase; 
- 
the stroke of the wicket gate servomotor piston; 
- 
stroke of runner servomotor; 
- 
active power at the generator terminals.

where SR is the measured servomotor stroke. 
From the measured dimensions and taking into account relations  (1) – (7), one obtained the values 
of head, turbine efficiency, flow, runner blades opening angle and the opening of the runner blades. 
As we may remark, for the 13.44 m head, 4 angular positions of the runner blades ϕ we measured, 
obtaining four sets of helicoidal curves whose envelope represents the turbine efficiency curve for the 
given head, curve which is compared to that resulted from scaled up from model at the same head. 
Instruments for graphic plotting and value extraction with the help of the CAD Microstation 
software 
In order to plot the results of the tests performed, we decided to import the calculated values into the 
CAD Microstation software because, beside the precision of determining value differences between 
curves in the CAD environments, the application offers, for interpolations, a „b-spline” curve [8], [9] 
and also a higher easiness in utilisation. 
Thus, for the rapid data import into Microstation we developed a sequence of commands grouped in 
a „macro” which takes over the points coordinates from a „.csv” file exported from Excel, and 
transposes them into the CAD environment together with the afferent curves. Fig. 2 presents the 
window of developed macro, named „curve settings”.

Current Solutions in Mechanical Engineering

The macro allows the user to define the parameters from a plot such as: type of plot curve, type of 
line, thickness, colour, tagging and other CAD options such as layers where plots and grid are to be 
placed.    
There is however certain conditions imposed to source files providing the points for plotting. The 
Excel structure of a datafile for exemplification is presented in the figure below: 
 
Fig. 3. Example of file structure for importing  
The file presented in fig. 3 represents the value of the points calculated for the runner blades 
opening angle against debit, ϕ = f(Q) at a certain head. In fig. 3, cell A1 represents the number of 
curves to be plotted from this file, cells A2-A5 bear the tags to be placed on the plot, cells  B2-B5 show 
the number of points defining the curve for each opening,  A7 sets the start location  of the first curve, 
A8-A19 the current point number, B8 - B19  the values of the flow (Q) for the ordinate (x axis), C8 – 
C29 values of the runner blades opening angle (ϕ) for the abscissa (y axis). The same structure was 
followed for the other three curves. 
With this type of tests however most of the times the beneficiaries desire comparisons and value 
comparisons. In order to realise this type of comparisons during tests or immediately after their 
finalisation we developed another macro, called „Table settings”, which takes over points from 
Microstation and transposes them into Excel values. The dialog box of this macro is presented in figure 
4 below. 
 
Fig. 4. The window of the point export „macro”  
The macro reads the coordinates of the points marked on the existing plot with the command „Place 
active points” from Microstation framed by a  „Fence” block. Additionally, for getting the point we 
need two files: an intermediate file called  „file1.txt” and an  Excel file called „MEX.xls” which have 
to be open when pressing the OK button. The only thing the operator has to do is to place the selected 
points for value extraction.

Presentation of graphic results of index tests results with Microstation 
With the results obtained, presented in table 1 and with the help of the „curves” macro and the 
previous procedure we obtained the plot of the representative dimensions from the index tests 
performed on the aforementioned hydro unit, for the 13.44 m head. 
The points marked by red triangle on the figure 5 plot represent the operation on the combinatory 
cam implemented in the hydro unit governor on the test moment. As it can be remarked, it does not 
always correspond with the maximum efficiency point obtained from the index tests, and the blue line 
dropped for the maximum efficiency obtained by intersecting the plotted curves for the opening of the 
blade of wicket gate and runner does not have values measured in these points. The marking of the 
intersection between the optimum efficiency obtained from tests and the curves of the two adjustment 
parts (wicket gate and runner) with „active point” from Microstation and the use of the „Curve 
settings” macro allowed the comparison of the adjustment parts curves obtained from index tests, 
resulted from scaled up from model and implemented in the governor presented in fig. 6.

Conclusions 
This method, used for graphic plotting of index tests results and verifications of combinatory cams 
with the help of the Microstation CAD software  and the two developed macros, was applied for the 
test performed on 16 hydro units, before and after the refurbishment works or capital repairs and was 
accepted by the beneficiaries. The method allows the almost total elimination of errors that may occur 
in the graphic transmission of numeric results, as the 3D design environments are very precise. 
As regards index tests, beside the possibility of  import, export and short-time comparison of the 
curves obtained, the spline curve implemented in  Microstation allows the best approximation used up 
to the present by the authors of the efficiency helilcoidal curves obtained for a given head and their 
envelope for comparison with the efficiency curve resulted from the model transposition.   
Beside the benefits highlighted above, this methods presents an additional use of the CAD software 
which may be utilised in other engineering fields.

Abstract. This paper presents a mechatronic solution for monitoring the crops vegetation status. A 
data acquisition system containing different types of sensors (multispectral, temperature, plant height, 
GPS) is placed on a terrestrial mechatronic platform that is carried by a tractor or on an UAV 
(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). The multispectral sensor offers information about the reflectance, for 
discrete wavelengths, necessary to compute the so called vegetation indices. They are correlated with 
the degree of development and plant health, thermal and water stress, pests, fertilizer need and so on. 
Knowing these information, a timely intervention is possible, allowing to supply water, pesticide and 
fertilizer in the proper quantity, at the proper time and in the precise place, leading to major economic 
impact and significant environmental protection. Geographical information are used for 
geo-referencing the acquired data, so that the thematic maps to be generated.  
Introduction 
Day by day we face on different challenges that may affect, step by step the future of humanity. We 
discuss here about changes in global climate, globalization, significant population growth and limited 
food resources, increasing pollution, damage of the environment and so on. This is why we have to 
think and act not only for us, but especially for those that are coming after us, namely to ensure the 
needs of present generation without compromising those of the next generations. This means 
sustainable development, in the way it was defined by the World Commission for Environment and 
Development.  
An important solution for a part of the actual problems, may be the concept of sustainable 
agriculture. This supposes to obtain intensive productions with competitive results, but „being 
friendly” with the environment, integrating technological components used in a balanced, scientific 
way [1].  
A sustainable agriculture supposes first of all to have viable crops management, in terms of soil 
resources monitoring and also in monitoring the crops vegetation status. Doing so, very efficient 
interventions will be possible, regarding the real time allocation of water, fertilizers, pesticides etc. 
and more than that, they can be deployed exactly in the needed place (precision advantage) and 
exactly in the needed quantity (economical advantage). 
In the concept of precision agriculture soil, water resources and chemical inputs have to be 
optimized in order to obtain larger and better quality productions. 
For implementing that concept, information about crops vegetation status are very important and 
mechatronics may play a significant role in solving this issue. Combining mechanics, electronics and 
software, it can offer a reliable solution for an integrated system that contains special designed data 
acquisition part for collecting valid field data “on the go”, together with the carrying mechanical 
platform and the programs for data storage, processing, transmission and interpretation.

Problem formulation 
This paper presents a solution for monitoring the crops vegetation status, intended to be 
implemented on mechatronic terrestrial platforms, and focuses on the multispectral data acquisition 
system.  
Theoretical aspects 
The state of the art analysis in precision agriculture domain, regarding the vegetation status 
monitoring aims at: technologies and equipment used for measurements; measurement techniques; 
methods and algorithms used for information processing; results interpretation and decision making 
technologies. 
As far as the advanced technologies and equipment involved are concerned, in such type of 
measurements we mention: artificial vision, spectroscopy, use of X-rays, magnetic resonance, 
chemical methods for detection, wireless sensors networks and RFID sensors [2, 3, 4, 5]. The use of 
multispectral detection methods was studied at large scale in order to evaluate the nutrition level of 
crops based on the reflectance level in several spectral bands [6, 7, 8]. The best results for monitoring 
are obtained by using hyper- or multispectral equipment that allow monitoring on extended areas [9]. 
For detection, identification, quantification and monitoring the crops diseases optical sensors are used 
and better results are obtained by help of thermography, chlorophyll-fluorescence and multi- and 
hyper-spectral sensors [10, 11, 12]. 
Monitoring the vegetation status of crops can be done by calculating and interpreting the vegetation 
indices. They are parameters correlated with the development and health status of the plants, based on 
spectral response of the vegetation while interacting with the incident solar radiation. 
A detailed study on the vegetation indices was performed in [13] obtaining seven different 
categories pointing on broadband greenness, narrowband greenness, canopy nitrogen, canopy water 
content, dry or senescent carbon, leaf pigments and light efficiency. More than 50 indices were 
analysed, having the wavelength between 445 and 2200 nm, most of them covering the VIS (visible) 
and NIR (near-infrared) domains.  
For each vegetation index, information like acronym, name, description, calculation formula, 
wavelength, domain, current values, source and bibliographic data were centralized in dedicated 
tables (Tab.1), obtaining important information regarding the interpretation of the spectral data used 
for crops management.

For computing these indices, the reflectance values for different wavelengths have to be measured 
and this will be done using a special designed mechatronic system that consists in the carrying 
platform (terrestrial or aerial), the data acquisition system and the decision making software. 
Comparing to existing systems, the novelty consists in the higher number of vegetation indices that 
can be computed, due to the data collected for a higher number of wavelengths, the reconfigurable 
acquisition platform, regarding the sensors type and them positioning possibilities and also in the 
special designed mechatronic carrying platform [14]. 
The structure of the mechatronic system 
Two types of mechatronic system models were designed (Fig. 1):  
 Multispectral Terrestrial Mobile Mechatronic System (MTMMS) for multispectral 
monitoring of crops vegetation status allowing mounting on agricultural equipment 
(tractors), option addressed to farmers with low financial possibilities; 
406
Current Solutions in Mechanical Engineering

 Multispectral Autonomous Aerial Mobile Mechatronic System (MAAMMS) of 
multispectral monitoring of crops vegetation status consisting of a drone with 4, 6 or 8 
motors (quad-copter, hex-copter, octo-copter) which has all the facilities for land 
monitoring based on imposed GPS coordinates. 
On both systems it is integrated an Acquisition, Processing, Storage and Transmission of 
Multispectral Information System (APSTSMI) for collecting data about the crops vegetation status.  
These systems are accompanied by an Innovative Technology for Multispectral Monitoring of the 
Vegetation Status of Crops (ITMMVSC) meant for improving precision agricultural management.

The structure of the data acquisition system 
Compared to the systems existing on the market, APSTSMI has to provide the following benefits:  
 Large number of channels for simultaneous measuring of spectral values (8 – 16 
channels) allowing the calculus of an increased number of vegetation indices; 
 Reduced weight, a very important criterion for APSTSMI displacement with the drone; 
 Reduced consumption of energy, an important condition for the drone autonomy; 
 Faster data acquisition and processing regardless of illumination conditions; 
 Data storage and/or wireless transmission options using different types of 
communication interfaces (WiFi - IEEE 802.11, Zigbee IEEE 802.15.4, Zigbee Pro, 
GSM/GPRS); 
 Precision integrated GPS system, required for acquired data geo-referencing in order to 
draw crops favorability and risk maps. 
The structure of the data acquisition system intended to be used on the terrestrial mechatronic 
platform is presented in Fig. 2. 
The most important element is definitely the spectral sensor. Two types of sensors were used in our 
systems: multispectral (offering information for certain wavelengths) and hyperspectral (measuring 
reflectance on a continuous domain).  
The multispectral sensor is a CropScan MSR87 – working at 460, 510, 560, 610, 660, 710, 760, 
810 nm and MSR16R – working at 860, 900, 970, 1050, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1500 nm (Fig. 3) and due 
to the high weight it is carried by a mechatronic terrestrial platform fixed on a tractor and moving in 
the field together with it.

For the hyperspectral sensors, offers from the major manufacturing companies were studied. 
Miniature spectrometers are available at companies like OCEAN OPTICS (STS micro-spectrometer) 
HAMAMATSU (C11009MA, C11010MA mini-spectrometers, C10988MA-01 ultra-compact 
mini-spectrometer integrating MEMS and image sensor technologies), NANO OPTIC DEVICES 
(Nano-Stick Spectrometer), StellarNet Inc. (Miniature Fiber Optic BLUE-Wave spectrometers), 
Thoth Technology Inc. (Argus IR spectrometers) and others. 
At this stage were selected OCEAN OPTICS miniature spectrometers covering the VIS (350-800 
nm) and the NIR (650-1100 nm) domains with optical resolution of 1.5 nm. 
For the MTMMS, the existing DLC 2000 data acquisition system (Fig. 4) has to be adapted for 
dynamic measuring and a special acquisition software was created. 
 
 
Fig. 4. DLC 2000 – Data Logger Controller used for multispectral data acquisition on the terrestrial 
mechatronic platform 
Due to the fact that MTMMS has to collect not only reflectance but also other important 
information (plant temperature and height, for example), a distinct microcontroller system was used, 
namely an Arduino Mega. 
408
Current Solutions in Mechanical Engineering

All the acquired data have to be georeferenced, so that a GPS module was necessary. For the 
terrestrial platform a high precision GPS (Trimble GeoXH) was used and this communicates with 
Arduino by a serial interface (RS-232). 
A storage system using a microSD memory card offers the possibility to store a large quantity of 
data. 
The main problem we were faced was the synchronization of the acquired information from 
different systems (DLC 2000, GPS and Arduino Mega) so that to organize the data in records for the 
database.  
A ZigBee communication interface allows to send and receive data between the data acquisition 
system and a computer. 
The Cropscan sensors and DLC cannot be used on the MAAMMS first of all due to them weight 
and dimensions.  
A different data acquisition system was designed for the drone, based on Ocean Optics STS 
micro-spectrometer, Libelium Waspmote or Arduino microcontroller boards and dedicated GPS/3G 
modules, all of them well known for light weight, flexibility, good performance and small power 
consumption. Significant improvements had to be made to the acquisition software so that the 
Raspberry Pi of Ocean Optics STS system to acquire data from two spectrometers. Detailed 
information will be available in next papers after the patent for the integrated data acquisition system 
will be finalized. 
Conclusions 
The purpose of the research is to design, implement and test a mechatronic system for multispectral 
monitoring of crops vegetation status based on reflectance measurement. In most cases this 
measurement is done static, when the farmer moves in the field and successively gathers spectral data 
in certain locations of the crop. 
Using these mechatronic systems, dynamic monitoring of the crops vegetation status is possible 
(“on the go”), in real time, allowing farmers timely intervention when identifying a plant stress, 
manifested as a result of lack of water or due to improper temperatures or the presence of pests. And 
this can often be the rescue of the entire crop. 
Comparing to existing systems, advantages aim on: 
 The higher number of vegetation indices that can be computed by acquiring spectral data for 
multiple wavelengths; 
 Reconfigurable acquisition platform, regarding the sensors type and them positioning 
possibilities; 
 The valuable decisional tool that we called Innovative Technology for Multispectral 
Monitoring of the Vegetation Status of Crops (ITMMVSC), based on artificial intelligence 
techniques, overlapping agricultural information on GIS elements, offering a precision crop 
management tool. 
Different solutions according to the financial possibilities of the farmers are provided, consisting 
in a Multispectral Terrestrial Mobile Mechatronic System (MTMMS) for farmers with limited 
financial possibilities and a Multispectral Autonomous Aerial Mobile Mechatronic System 
(MAAMMS) containing the drone, for monitoring the vegetation status of the crops. 
The Acquisition, Processing, Storage and Transmission System for Multispectral Information 
(APSTSMI) is special designed with respect to the above two systems.  
All the research is developed under project MoniCult - Design, Implementation and Testing of a 
Mechatronic System for Multispectral Monitoring of Crops Vegetation Status.

Keywords: in-pipe robots, mechanisms, adaptable structure, minirobots  
Abstract. In the first part, the paper presents a classification of the in-pipe inspection robots and the 
features of the mechanisms used in the design of the pipe inspection robots with adaptable structure. 
The authors’ contribution to the development of three wheeled minirobots with two four bar 
mechanisms placed on two parallel planes, is presented is the second part of the paper. 
Introduction  
Pipelines are the main way of transportation for fuels, oil, gasses, drinkable and residual water. 
The special working enviroment makes these pipes easily susceptible to damage and erosion, which 
can lead to accidents and leakage. Aging, pinching, corrosion, cracks, residue accumulation and 
mechanical damage can cause very expensive local damage. 
Inspection robots for the inside of the pipe can provide visual information and can identify 
various defects, microorganisms included in various corrosion processes therefore can answer 
specific questions. This type of robots can explore narrow spaces of the pipelines using sensors and 
video cameras. 
 
In pipe inspection robots classification 
 
Pipe inspection robots can be classified in two categories: robots that inspect the outside of the 
pipes and robots that can inspect the inside of the pipes. The inside pipe inspection robots can be 
classified according to several criteria: locomotion system, mechanical structure adaptability, 
adapting method to the inner surface of pipes, structure arrangement, autonomy. 
• Thus, in [1], [2], Roh suggests a classiﬁcation of the locomotion systems  used to solve the in-
pipe inspection problems, according to the locomotion mechanisms as follows: pig type (passively 
driven by the ﬂuid pressure), wheeled type, caterpillar type, wall-pressing type, walking type, 
inchworm type, screw type.  
 
The wheeled robots are the simplest and most energy efficient robots and they have the greatest 
potential for long distance travel. Also, they can achieve great speeds due to the wheels which 
generate a very efficiant drive force. Wheeled robots do not need complicated mechanisms in their 
structure, they can overcome many obstructions that they may encounter inside pipe lines and they 
can also carry large weights. 
As some disadvantages regarding this type of robots we can mention: high friction forces (needed 
for locomotion) can damage the inner surface of teh pipe, the wheels can get stuck in pipe cracks (if 
the cracks are large enough), high probability of slippage inside the pipe. 
By equipping the wheels with springs, the maneuverability of the robots expands. Thus, this 
category of robots present the ability to adapt to uneven in-pipe surfaces, to move inside vertical 
pipe sections, and to be stable without slipping whilst inside the pipes.  
 
• Depending on the mechanical structure adaptability, the following types of in-pipe robots 
were developed:

- with rigid structure - used for inspection inside pipelines with certain diameters;  
- with adaptable structure - used for inspection in pipes with different diameters (their structure 
consists of mechanisms that allow them to adapt to different pipe diameters), 
 
The singular propulsion locomotion mechanisms (wheel, track, stepper, inch-worm, snake, 
screw and pig type) have advantages and disadvantages, depending on the conditions from inside 
the pipe. 
 
In order to overcome the disadvantages of this type of locomotion mechanisms, hybrid systems 
have been developed, which combine two or more propulsion mechanisms to obtain robust and 
flexible robots. 
The hybrid locomotion systems can be classified in three categories: caterpillar wall-pressed 
type, wheeled wall-pressed type and wheeled wall-pressing screw type [3]. 
This type of locomotion systems overcome the limitations of the rigid mechanisms and the pipe 
shape conditions such as diameter variations, pipe curvature and inclination etc. The hybrid 
locomotion robots belong to the adaptable structure robots category. 
 
 • Depending on the robot's adaptability to the inner surface of the pipe, the adpating methods 
can be identified as passive or active. 
 
The passive methods use mechanisms with articulated elements supported by elastic 
components such as springs. The main advantages of the passive methods are that there are no 
sudden movements when adapting to a pipe diameter change and the lack of independent control of 
the normal force (reactions between the wheel and the pipe wall).  
By using elastic elements such as springs and without using additional actuators, more robots can 
passively adapt to the inner surface of the pipes. The main disadvantages are that they cannot adapt 
to a wide range of pipe diameters and that they cannot adjust the normal force when necessary [4]. 
The normal force between the robot and the pipe is controlled with additional actuators for robots 
that actively adapt to the inner surface of the pipe. Their locomotion is more efficient compared to 
the robots with passive adaptation methods. 
When a control of the normal force is necessary, the active methods are much more complicated 
than the passive ones, but they are more robust. Many designers use some passive methods, because 
of their advantages, to assist in their active systems [4]. 
 
• Depending on their placement on the robot's structure, the adapting mechanisms can be 
placed: on a single plane with the elements at 180° around the longitudinal axis; in three or four 
planes with the elements placed at 120° or 90° angles around the logitudinal axis.  
While the robots with the three and four planes structure develop a high traction force and they 
have good stability, the robots with a single plane structure have the advantage of a simpler 
structure. 
• According to their autonomy, the mobile in-pipe robots for inspection and exploration can be 
classified as: non-autonomous, semi-autonomous and autonomous. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:  it describes features of the mechanisms used 
for in-pipe inspection robots with adaptable structure, it presents aspects regarding the mechanical 
design of the pipe inspection minirobots with adaptable structure IPMR-1 and IPMR-2, it 
determines the relation between the spring tension and the reaction between the pipe and the wheel 
and finally, in the end of the paper we have the Summary. 
 
Specific adaptation mechanisms in the pipe inspection robot with wheels 
 
The wheeled in-pipe adaptable robots usually consist of the actuating system and the adapting 
system. The first provides the power needed to turn the drive wheels. The adapting system provides 
permanent contact between the drive wheels and the pipe wall and enough pressure in order to 
achieve traction force trough friction. The adapting mechanism can affect the performance of the 
robot, but it has a very important role in the proper functionality of the whole system.

Current Solutions in Mechanical Engineering

Several types of mechanisms which can increase the pressure between the drive wheels of the 
robot and and the pipe wall, are recorded in the speciality literature. 
These mechanisms allow the adjustment of the contact between the drive wheels and the pipe 
wall and they are generating adjustable pressures. The drive wheels and the adjacent elements are 
connected trough rotation couplings. Figure 1 presents two basic connections for generating contact 
with the pipe wall [5], [6].

In order for the in-pipe robots to adapt their dimensions to fit into the pipe and to increase their 
travel stability, the axial dimension of the robots is usually larger than the transversal dimension. 
As a general design guideline, in order for the adaptable structure to generate enough force and 
sufficient linear displacement in the point where the force is applied, the mechanism that applies the 
force has to be placed either along the axial direction of the robot or on a parallel direction. 
In this way the adaptability of the robot will increase to a larger range of pipe diameter variations 
Several adapting mechanisms, which can be used in constructing in-pipe robots, can be identified in 
[5], [6]. 
These mechanisms were obtained by combining a four bar mechanism with a sliding mechanism, 
finally obtaining and adapting mechanism with one degree of fredom. 
Other adapting mechanisms prezented in the speciality literature  have been recorded, such as:  
the pantograph mechanism [8], the four bar mechanism, the slider crank mechanism, or 
combinations of these mechanisms.  
 
The structure of the developed in-pipe inspection minirobots 
 
The developed minirobots (named IPMR-1 and IPMR-2 after the abbreviation for In Pipe 
Inspection Mini Robot) consist of two four bar mechanisms placed in two parallel planes, each  
mechanism having the opposite elements equal and parallel (Fig. 2). For locomotion, the system 
was equipped with three double wheels, of which two are passive and one of them is active. Both 
drive and idle (guide) wheels are made of rubber in order to obtain a greater grip to the inner surface 
of the pipe [7]. The movement transmission between the motors placed in the center of the 
minirobots and the drive wheels is done trough gears. The force which presses the wheels onto the 
inner walls of the pipe is generated by a helical spring placed between the B and C joints (Fig. 2). 
The equilibrium state of the minirobots is obtained due to the force that presses the wheels onto the 
inner walls of the pipe. 
The features of the IPMR-1 are:  the length of the elements:

the IPMR-1. The upper wheel has the radius

Regarding the adapting method to the inner surface of the pipe, the minirobots developed by the 
authors fall into the passive adaptive method category, and regarding the placement of the adapting 
mechanisms, the robots fall into the category of robots which have the structure in contact with the 
pipe in a single plane. 
From the single plan structure category we can mention the MOGRER robot developed by 
Okada, T. and Sanemori, T., [8]. Also, as more recent developments, we can mention the PIRATE 
[9] and RoboScan [10] modular systems. 
Compared with MOGRER, IPMR-1 and IPMR-2 have the following features: 
- three double wheels (a drive wheel and two passive wheels); 
- the drive wheels are placed on the lower side of the minirobots; 
- the driving motor is placed in the central area of the minirobot; 
- the geared transmission from the motor to the drive wheel. 
IPMR-1 and IPMR-2 have the following characteristics: the reduced number of drive motors (one 
DC motor), the simple structure (small number of components that can be manufactures with 
conventional technologies), adaptability (the ability to adapt to diameter changes). The design of the 
developed minirobots allows them to move through horizontal and vertical pipe networks. 
IPMR-1 and IPMR-2 are destined for in pipe inspection tasks inside pipes with diameters ranging 
between 50 and 70 [mm].  
 
Determining the pressing force of the minirobots onto the pipe wall 
 
The spring and the mechanisms that build the IPMR-1 will generate, trough the wheels, a force F 
onto the inner wall of the inspected pipe. The relation between this force F and the tension T from 
the spring can be determined by considering the following conditions: 
- initially, before inserting the robot into the pipe, the tension T from the spring is zero and θ = 
θmin  (Fig. 4 a).

- when inserting the robot into the pipe, the spring is tensioned and the height of the robot gets 
smaller, conditioned by the angle θ (Fig. 4 b).

Conclusions 
After classifying and presenting the particularities of the mechanisms used in building the in-pipe 
robots with adaptable structure, the authors present two in-pipe minirobots with adaptable structure 
that are built using linkage mechanisms. These robots can cover a range of diameters between 50 
and 70 [mm].

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study regarding the specific components from 
thermoplastic polymers and ceramic powders for a assistant robot. Experimental research targets the 
testing of these materials in order to optimize the vertebrae of the robot. The vertebrae are part of a 
miniature robot (size, weight) for exploration and interventions in a limited space. The simplicity 
and small size are advantageous for reliability, safety, fast installation and ease of use. Knowing the 
friction coefficient shows a great importance, particularly in the friction coupling in which 
movement occurs with low speeds. 
Introduction 
Assistant robots successfully compete, in terms of cost and technical performance, with standard 
robots. As a result, global production of assistant robots worldwide has increased rapidly, reaching 
a continuous increase of 4-10% annually [1]. This development is due prospects, turned into reality, 
for use in diverse purposes (surgery, exploration, small space interventions, etc). 
Robotic surgery allows minimally invasive surgery; however, limited maneuverability of the 
equipment is causing problems to surgeons. To overcome this limitation were developed several 
robotic devices. The adopted solution is a robotic arm [2], using flexible connection elements, 
stable force and large working space for efficient applications. 
Robotic arm assembly consists of two flexible spatial mechanisms, one outside and another 
inside with relative motion between them. Each device contains a lot of rigid vertebrae with 
spherical surfaces, arranged in series, connected by actuation cable and driven by digital linear 
actuators. In addition to this variant, the cables pass through a tube to reduce the friction between 
moving elements. Service radius is 86 mm. Each mechanism is continuously operated by one 
stepper actuator with 1.25 Nm torque and 120 RPM speed, which allows an advance / retreat speed 
of the robotic arm of 50 mm / s. Robotic arm assembly with spherical joints is represented in Fig. 1.

To achieve the digital design of the vertebrae was used the practice based on digital prototype - 
DMV: Mack-Up Digital, which consists entirely in 3D design. First step is to create 3D solid model 
based on drawings of the part, using CAD techniques.  
To prevent twisting of the vertebrae during operation, on the external surfaces of adjacent 
elements (outer vertebrae) of the robotic arm are two 2.5 × 3.7 mm channels diametrically opposed 
to one end and two blots 2 × 1 mm at the other end. 
In order to determine the wall thickness of the outer vertebrae was used the relation of the limit 
strength to compression and tensile breaking of the thin wall tube axially loaded [3]: 
 
 =

 [	
].                                                                                                                              (1) 
 
where,  – compressive strength limit in cross-section,  F - applied force on axial direction,               
N represents the tensioning cable force; A - cross-sectional area. Also, the cross-sectional area is 
calculated with the relationship: 
 
 =

 
 −
.                                                                                                                          (2) 
 
in which  - outer diameter of the section;  -  inner diameter of the section. In this case, = 14.5 
mm is imposed from the configuration and dimensions of the trocar, usually with an internal 
diameter of 2, 3, 5, 10, 11, 13, and 15 mm. Using relations (2) and (3) it can be determined the 
minimum thickness of the vertebra: 
 
 =

  −[].                                                                                                       (3) 
 
Considering a safety factor of 1.5, the resulted wall thickness of the vertebra is of 3.2 mm. 
2. Materials and manufacturing 
The achieving of vertebrae is contingent on finding a material that shows an increased friction 
coefficient, low thermal expansion coefficient, good thermal shock strength, and elasticity enough 
to withstand existing permanent deformations in operating conditions of the robotic arm. Field of 
interest is headed to thermoplastic polymers and ceramic powders with special additives on 
nonconventional technologies (sintering, 3D printing, and rapid prototyping). Quality conditions 
(composition, density, crystal module, elasticity module) have satisfied the conditions imposed in 
terms of achieving experimental models. 
For spherical joint, the approximate relationship between force F due axial load and torque  
applied on spherical surface with radius  and coefficient of friction µ is given by: 
 
 =
!"#$
% × (                                                                                                                                      (4) 
 
As shown in eq. 4, to obtain a greater force is required a small radius  of the sphere. How this 
radius is technology imposed, it follows that the friction coefficient between the vertebrae is crucial. 
When friction between vertebrae is low, pulling force required to withstand its own weight, and 
the loads applied is enormous. For this reason the material selection is an essential factor. After an 
analysis, the classification of materials is made on structural criteria in Table 1.

     For actuation cables, it was chosen a cable without abrasion, capable to reach a small bend 
radius, according to the winding roll. Therefore, it was used a steel cable with a diameter of 0.76 
mm and a small stretch (≈3%) [5].

3. Experiments and tests 
To compare the performance of vertebrae with different materials (thermoplastic polymers and 
ceramic powders) were manufactured and tested two sets of vertebrae. The main dimensions of the 
vertebrae are shown in Table 2.

The method used is based on the friction created between the two components of the friction 
coupling, the part is fixed and the disc is with rotating ball.  Pressure force N is created by a system 
of calibrated weights that adjusts at each case. By using an advance software it can be determined 
the friction coefficient µ according to the normal pressure force and friction Ff () =
*
+ ). 
Tribological properties (friction and wear) of thin layers of thermoplastic polymers and ceramic 
powders were determined by tests like disk on ball or pin on disk with linear or rotary motion. The 
CSM Instruments TRIBROMETER has the following functional parameters: the load system with 
0.25N, 38.75 N, 5 N, 1 N, 5 N, 10 N, 20 N, the maximum speed of 1500 rpm, the maximum test 
speed of 100 mm / s, the control unit with data acquisition and analysis, special software control, 
data acquisition and processing data, software to analysis the wear surfaces, measurements report.

It was chosen dry friction option to extract the real value of the friction coefficient. Testing is 
performed for 7 min for each sample, with registration of the forces at equal time intervals. 
The tested material, thermoplastic polymer, have the following properties: tensile strength - 49.9 
MPa; elongation - 15-25 bending strength - 74.6 MPa; bulk density - 83.0 Shore. 
To determine the wear behavior of the materials was carried out a set of tests on a 
TRIBROMETER CSM Instruments machine, at University of Craiova, in the following terms: 
working mode: linear; amplitude: 4 mm / stroke; Linear speed: 10 cm / sec .; load capacity: 2N; 
number of cycles: 100; ball diameter: 6mm; average temperature: 20 degrees C0; humidity: 30%. 
4. Results and discussions 
There are presented the wear test results for the two sets of vertebrae tested. Fig. 4 shows the 
wear diagram for vertebrae made of thermoplastic polymers, and Fig. 5 id the wear diagram for 
vertebrae made from ceramic powders. From the diagrams it results the friction variation, the depth 
penetration variation and friction coefficient µ. 
The tests of wear for vertebrae made from ceramic powders and thermoplastic polymers are 
presented in Table 3. The average value ), of the friction coefficient µ, according to the normal 
force and friction force for thermoplastic polymers vertebrae is:

The vertebrae made from ceramic powders with friction coefficient of ≈0,003÷0,169, after a 
few minutes of spins under load, the contact surfaces were smoothed and polished, and the friction 
coefficient dropped dramatically. Thus, these materials are unsuitable for the examined robotic arm. 
The second type of material, thermoplastic polymers, have a coefficient of friction ≈ 0.032. With 
this material it was possible a pulling force of ≈ 0.11 kN.

Conclusions 
The paper presents a study regarding the specific components for an assistant robot. Also, it have 
been developed the technologies of these components (sintering, rapid prototyping, 3D printing). 
Two sets of vertebrae have been designed, manufactured and tested. One of this is the thermoplastic 
polymers and the second one is ceramic powders. 
Tribological properties (friction and wear) of thin layers of thermoplastic polymers and ceramic 
powders were determined by tests like disc on ball or pin on disk with linear or rotary motion. Tests 
showed very good performances for vertebrae made of thermoplastic polymers. Surface accuracy 
(0.1 to 0.3 mm) and roughness are suitable, and final pieces do not require further processing.  
In conclusion, it can be said that elements from thermoplastic polymers using rapid prototyping 
technology fall within the rigors of shape and size, structure and production time. Knowledge of 
friction coefficients shows a great importance. The friction coefficient varies depending on: 
roughness surface, sliding velocity and temperature.

Abstract. The current study reveals a method of cinematic calculus of a manipulator, whose 
geometry has been created according to the model of a plant. 
The calculus method has been experimentally checked on a scale model. 
Introduction 
In the last decades, bioinspiration has adopted in the development of robotic structures. 
Biological systems are a source of inspiration in robotics design in the domain of neuroscience, 
rehabilitation and functional compensation of neurological disorders, physiotherapy and training by 
means of soft-actuated wearable exoskeleton [1-3]. 
The problem of a synthesis of a robotic mechanism based on the movements of plants consists of 
establishing the geometry of the mechanisms and of the parameters of the fluid which ensure a 
certain trajectory of the characteristic point. 
Such a problem can become useful, for instance, in some medical robots. The strength of such a 
construction relies on the elimination of the systems which transmit the movement from an engine 
which underlies in different points of the robot. 
It is consider a system like in Fig. 1, in which the characteristic point accomplishes a certain 
trajectory, according to the air parameters and the geometry of slates and of the linkage of the robot 
can be imagined. 
Theoretical consideration 
 
Based on the kinematic scheme from Fig. 1, an experimental model was done and presented in 
the following images. 
 
Based on the available possibilities we have done a model made of parts from mechanic calculi 
machines and typing machines, out of use. The model is not spectacular but it corresponds to the 
purpose of studying movements and checking calculi through measurements on the model. 
 
Fig. 1. Kinematical scheme 
 
There are also some stiffened tags on the model with mobile elements of the manipulator. Their 
purpose is to take over the compressed air flow so that motor forces can appear and operate the

manipulator. The entire kinematic chain and the positioning of the tags were done by analogy with a 
branch with leaves, according to the ones presented in the previous chapters. 
It is also mentioned that the model can function in the positions of the base: with the base in the 
superior part and the kinematic chain hanging from the base, Fig. 2 or with the base down and the 
kinematic chain in the superior part, in which case in order to do the measurements we used flexible 
wires to strain and maintain it in the wanted position (Fig. 3).

(axis y to the left, axis x towards the viewer, axis z up) 
 
In both cases scale tags were used, rendering three projection plans, in order to easily take the 
experimental measurements. 
We must mention that in real life working conditions the manipulator has resistant forces and 
couples and straining-balancing elements which ensure the stable positions of the elements of the 
kinematic chains.

Conclusions 
The understudied mechanism, belonging to a manipulator type R – R - T – R is destined to action 
controlled air comprised jets. 
Using the indicated methods you can determine the positions of the characteristic dot for each set 
of values for the generalized coordinates. 
Initially the mechanism was studied in a static position, doing the calculi and checking the 
calculated values. 
The experimental verification of the position confirmed the accuracy of the algorithm as well as 
the calculi programme. 
The positions were then studied, for a continuous movement, using arbitrarily chosen movement 
laws. 
References for the speed and acceleration were established, obtaining a calculi program, based on 
which diagrams and charts were made. 
It has been noticed that the mechanism has complex movements.

Abstract. For stability and impact reaction forces assessment of a quadruped robot during walking, 
a dynamic analysis is considered. For this purpose, a variant of a quadruped robot based on Jansen 
mechanism is presented. For interpreting the influence of the reaction forces from the ground during 
walking, the analysis was conducted with help of ADAMS software using a 3D model of the robot. 
Material specifications, forces and moments acting in the robot structure were considered. 
Graphical results obtained regarding the ground reaction forces are displayed. Also a reduced mass 
moment of inertia at the crankshaft is taken into consideration based on Lagrange motion equation 
and generalized coordinates. 
Introduction 
Numerous researches on walking robots are conducted and many scientists are trying to find the 
best solutions for walking robots in order to adapt and deal with different environment conditions, 
to obtain a stable walk and to reduce costs. The variety of existing models and prototypes 
contributes to the development of this area of research. 
Walking mechanisms bring an important contribution on the walking robots mobility. The 
number of legs and the number of the degrees of freedom a walking robot possesses plays an 
important role when a better stability and adaptability is needed. Many types of leg mechanisms 
were used in the case of walking robots such as pantograph [1], Klann linkage [2] and Jansen 
mechanism [3], [4]. The advantages of these mechanisms consist of simplified control and the 
reduced number of degrees of freedom. 
For implementing this type of mechanisms in a walking robots structure, a series of analyses 
regarding kinematics and dynamics were done [4], [5]. CAD and MBD programs offer more 
advantages for kinematic and dynamic analysis. 
The aim of this article consists in modelling and simulating of a quadruped robot based on 
Jansen mechanism using ADAM’s software in order to evaluate the impact of the ground reaction 
forces on the walking robot structure. The main results obtained after the simulated dynamic 
analysis are presented. Because of diverse environment conditions a walking robot should deal 
with, the dynamic analysis is important to evaluate the potential risks a robot faces during walking, 
such as tipping over when encountering obstacles. External forces and moments that interact with 
the robot can influence the robot's behaviour and modify its dynamic stability. The relation between 
these forces and the generalized coordinates of a robot is expressed through equations of motion. 
General methods proposed for deriving the equations of motion are known in the scientific literature 
as Newton-Euler, Lagrange and Kane’s method [6].  
The Lagrangian represents the difference between potential and kinetic energy of a walking 
system.

Jansen mechanism  
The leg mechanism designed by Theo Jansen it is used in the structure of various walking 
systems [5], [7]. The elements are connected through revolute joints and the entire mechanism is 
driven by the crank 1. For a complete revolution of the crank, the leg's tip M describes an ovoid 
shape trajectory as presented in Fig. 1. Reduced degree of freedom makes this mechanism easier to 
control and insures less energy consumption. One advantage of its design consists of the possibility 
to walk smoothly on soft soils such as beaches, etc.   
 
 
Fig. 1. Jansen leg mechanism  
This type of mechanism gained attention from a series of researchers who dedicated their work 
for analysing it. The main subjects of the research are focused on the kinematics [7], dynamics [8] 
synthesis and optimisation of the mechanism [5]. An optimisation of the trajectory based on 
adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is presented in [9].  
Also, previous studies regarding Jansen mechanism including kinematics, kinetostatics and 
dimensional synthesis, were conducted in order to implement this mechanism into the structure of 
quadruped prototype [10]. A solution for increasing the step height of the trajectory and adding 
another DOF to the Jansen leg mechanism by using a 5-link belt mechanism was presented in [11]. 
In the next paragraphs will be presented the assumptions made for the dynamic analysis of the 
kinematic chain considered for the robot leg and the results obtained after conducting a dynamic 
analysis of the entire robotic system based on a virtual model.  
Theoretical approach for motion study 
By considering the positions, the centres of masses and inertia moments of each element of the 
mechanism as being known from the kinetostatic analysis conducted in [10], it is assumed that the 
total mass inertia is reduced to a single element (the crankshaft). A rotary motor is acting the 
mechanism through the crankshaft. The particular scheme of the reduced system is presented in Fig. 
2. The mechanism is composed of eight elements, including the fixed element, as in Fig. 1. The 
crank's 1 angular position and movement is described by the angle φ. It is considered that a gear 
motor is driving the crank.

This type of dynamic analysis is useful for evaluating the impact that the links have at the 
crankshaft and for making the right choices for driving motors according to their characteristics and 
for dimensioning of the robot. For better understanding of the dynamics for the entire system and in 
order to reduce time a virtual model of a quadruped robot based on Jansen’s leg mechanism will be 
considered. The details of this process are described in the next section.  
Dynamic analysis simulation in ADAMS 
A dynamic analysis developed using ADAMS software was considered based on a simplified 
geometric model of a quadruped robot system presented in Fig.3. This represents a preliminary 
model of the physical prototype described in [10]. 
 
 
Fig. 3 The quadruped system modelled in Adams 
 
The considered leg mechanism is of Jansen type mechanism presented in Fig. 1. The two sets of 
legs are placed on the sides of the robot's platform. The mechanisms were connected into pairs and 
driven by two cranks (K1 and K2) actuated in reverse directions. Bar and triangular elements are 
connected through revolute joints. Into the fixed joints of the cranks, two rotational motors with a 
60⁰/s speed (M1 and M2) were inserted. 
The dynamic analysis consists of the motion study of the robotic system under the action of 
forces that occur during walking. Assembly configuration of the robotic system, masses and inertia 
characteristics of the elements from the structure, internal and external forces and initial conditions 
for positions and velocities of each element represent the input data. The output data are the 
movement characteristics of the elements and the reaction forces from the mechanical system. 
The ground is represented as a rigid and fixed body in the assembly. The material chosen for this 
part is wood while the material considered for the rest component elements of the assembly is 
aluminium. Four points of contact between the mechanical system's end elements and the ground 
were considered. In these points appear the reaction forces between the system and the ground 
during walking. In case of contacts, the geometry of the bodies is fundamental.

Current Solutions in Mechanical Engineering

In this case the inertial forces that occur due to the mass of the system, the weights on centres of 
mass and due to the driving moment are considered. The gravity acceleration that appears in the 
centre of mass is taken as 9.81 mm/s2.  
After dynamic analysis, the variation of reaction forces in the joints, the contact forces Fx, Fy, Fz 
and moments Tx, Ty, Tz with the ground, the kinetic and potential energy for each element and the 
forces and moments acting in the centre of mass are obtained. A selection of the results will be 
displayed in the next section of the article. 
Static stability is insured for the leg mechanism. The stability during walking is analyzed

Conclusions 
From the simulation process it can be observed that a stability problem could appear during 
walking because the rule of the three points contact is not insured permanently. It seems that the 
projection of the centre of mass will fall on a line that connects two diagonally disposed contact 
points or at the edge of the polygon described on bottom plane when all the legs are on the ground. 
The system is in danger to fall if encounters an obstacle. Static stability is insured by the four legs. 
For obtaining dynamic stability, compensation alternatives should be considered as adding a 
supporting rod with a wheel. Other solutions to improve the gait stability will be considered. 
Further analysis will be taken into consideration regarding the dynamics of the system and the 
results obtained will be compared with the ones presented. A comparison between simulation and 
experimental results will be presented in a future work.

Abstract. The article aims to make the description of the process for obtaining a mathematical, 
kinematic and dynamic model of a six-wheeled robot, in order to obtain a representation that allows 
simulations of drivers in the following items addressed in diﬀerent ways the development of 
diﬀerential kinematics robots mostly with castor wheel as a fulcrum. 
Introduction 
This article aims to make the description of the process to obtain a mathematical and kinematic 
model of a six-wheeled robot, to get a reduced representation that allows simulations of drivers. In 
[1,2] a more detailed study of the models was carried out. In [3,4,5] appears the calculation process 
of the kinematics of a differential robot and some position controllers, moreover in [6-8] feature 
controls which made a mobile robot capable of following a desired trajectory. In [9] a complete 
development of the dynamics of a robot is presented including losses due to factors such as the 
inertia of the robot, and forces like the electromagnetic and the sliding. 
Dynamic model of the motors 
The motors used for the robot were from Golden Motor, this could be modeled such as a ideal 
DC motor, in this section is featured the pocess for only one motor wich after would be repeated six 
times, in the ﬁgure. 1 is the schematic circuit of the motor.

Kinematic Model 
The robot movement depends upon six motors, which have a common power supply but 
independent control, are directly connected to the wheels, it means that transmission losses are 
almost null, the arrangement of the motors in the robot can be seen in the Fig. 2, each pair of wheels 
(front, middle and rear) can be rotated around its axis up to 90 °, this allows to change the behavior 
of the vehicle, in this article the kinematic models resulting from the configurations which may take 
the robot will be described. 
 
Fig. 2 Arrangement of the mining robot 
Differential Model 
This configuration uses the six drive wheels to simulate the behavior of a differential robot, causing 
the velocity of each side equal to the sum of the speeds of the corresponding wheels, see Fig. 3.

Control  
Having the Eq. 19 where are the lineal speeds of each wheel, and the relation ' = !" × ]  where 
): is the radius of the wheel, !": is the angular speed of the motor, It is possible to relate the 
dynamic engine model discussed in the previous section and get a model that allows to control the 
robot path based on the voltages applied to each of the motors. To do this the following control 
architecture, where each engine has a local control reference speed which is given by the global 
control is proposed.

In Fig. 4, the whole control architecture is raised for the robot; it consists of a global controller, 
which is responsible for generating the reference speeds that must have the wheels on the right and 
left side to meet the reference position. There is also a block containing the forward kinematics of 
the robot to simulate the odometry thereof, the entrance to this are two blocks that contain local 
controllers internally for each engine in the Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 are the connections made for each 
motor.

Conclusions 
Due to the wheel arrangement of ACM1PT is possible to adopt a kinematic model known as the 
differential robot, and adapt it to the needs of control a sis-wheeled robot allowing the control laws 
and equations can be implemented in a simple way. Separate controls for each engine were made 
because although the model is the same, it cannot be considered as one in all circumstances, an 
example of this is when not all wheels on one side are in contact with the ground due to uneven 
ground.

Abstract. The article is aimed at presenting the development of a kinematic model for the control 
of a mobile robot 6 wheel, all with both traction and rotation, the Ackerman model was chosen 
because the robot will move through paths designed for cars, and as it avoids slipping. Two models 
of simulation in MATLAB, one in continuous and one discrete space are also presented. 
1. Introduction 
The article aims to show the development of a kinematic model for controlling a six-wheeled 
mobile robot, all have therefore traction and steer, Ackerman model was chosen because the robot 
will move along paths designed for cars, and it avoids slipping as show in [1, 2, 3]. The develop of 
the kinematic model were based on [4, 5, 6], in [7, 8, 9, 10] and [11] are different types of 
controllers for mobile robots. The dynamics models of mobile robots are worked in [12, 13, 14], in 
[15, 16] techniques based on neural networks were used to solve the trajectory tracking control 
problem. On [17, 18, 19] other configurations of robots are controlled. Al last in [20, 21, 22] the 
problem of motion control is solved in three different   ways, for this paper were developed two 
models for simulation made in MATLAB, one in continuous time and other in discrete time, where 
the six-wheeled robot were modeled as an Ackerman car-like having some constraints in account. 
2. Kinematic model 
The robot movement depends upon six motors, which have a common power supply but 
independent control, are directly connected to the wheels, it means that transmission losses are 
almost null, the arrangement of the motors in the robot can be see in Fig. 1, each pair of wheels 
(front, middle and rear) can rotate around its axis up to 90 °, this allows changing the behavior of 
the vehicle, then the kinematic models resulting from the configurations which may take the robot 
will be described.

3. Ackerman Kinematic model (modified) 
This configuration uses the six driving wheels divided into pairs (front, middle and rear) to 
simulate the behavior of a robot with a configuration Ackerman making a reflex to the rear wheels 
so that the wheels that generate the movement would be the pair of the middle and front and rear 
pairs establish the direction, the four wheels must have the same "instant center of curvature" (ICC), 
this allows the model equations remain the same, in the Fig. 2, the orientation of the wheels of the 
robot and the location of the ICC is observed. 
 
 
Fig 2: Wheels orientation and ICC. 
Using the theory presentend in [23], where are described the process to join the constraints of 
many wheels in a single robot model, over the next equations the process to achieve the direct 
kinematic is presented:

To validate the equations of the robot a kinematic model was implemented in MATLAB, where 
were applied different speeds and angles, in the Fig. 3 the scheme of the kinematic model both in

Conclusions 
Being able to have a kinematic model to simulate the behavior of the robot is a great advantage 
because it allows evaluating different types of controllers and choosing the one that best suits the 
needs. To use the Ackerman model in the six-wheeled robot, without seeing shifted the 
instantaneous center of rotation of the transverse axis of the vehicle was necessary that rear wheels 
reflected the behavior of the front, turning in the opposite direction.

Abstract. The follow paper explains the process design of the development of a mobile robotic 
vehicle which main purpose is to aid on task of exploration on the mining sector. The paper shows 
the whole process from the customer needs through the conceptual sketch to the definitive design. It 
also describes mathematical considerations for the selection of the motors for locomotion and 
steering. Followed by mechanical strength simulations in order to choose the right material and 
finally simulations of the behavior of the robotic vehicle suspension. 
1. Introduction 
The mining activities in Colombia are characterized by being located in places far from the 
principal roads with a geographic variety which makes the exploration tasks are very tough. 
Sometimes to reach the spots with possibilities of mineral, already have old paths with off road 
characteristics and it usually transport the exploration equipment by non-vehicles ways due to the 
terrain. Normally the enterprises hire locals to carry the equipment and tools of exploration; this 
type of work implies high HSEQ risk. The people have to move about 2 to 8 km to reach the zone 
and drill to get subsurface samples. Drilling equipment is separated into sets weighing about 300kg, 
and this burden is carried by 6 people. 
For this reason, a mining enterprise contact us, and request the develop of a vehicle with a 
specific requirements in order to apply it on their exploration task to transport the equipment and 
tools and avoid to hire locals to do this heavy and dangerous job. 
First the information was collected through a survey, where basically the engineering team 
gathers the customer requirements to transform those needs into design and engineer parameters, 
the chosen technique to relate the customer needs with engineering parameters was the Quality 
Function Deployment (QFD).  
Previous works related with robotic ground vehicles were focused to do task or missions in space. 
Kahili et al. did an algorithm for accurately guiding an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) [1], G. 
Liu et al, made an analysis of tracked vehicles and  how it interact passing through stairs with a 
robotic arm [2], K. Tadamura et al. show the development of a new tracked system with circular 
transversal section.

Abstract. Rectifiers are widely use in areas of industry and commerce to implement equipment 
which require to be powered by alternating current (AC) source, so that uncontrolled rectification 
requires an operational requirement study because they only properly works if the rectifier 
calculated boundary conditions are ideal and invariant. Therefore the implementation of control 
strategies should be take into account to generate the desired signal performance in the rectifier. 
This document shows the implementation of different control techniques on the behavior the 
sinusoidal current in a single-phase rectifier width modulated pulse and resistive load. 
Consequently, in this work the development of several control strategies are presented, for behavior 
analysis of signals in a rectifier with width pulse modulation and resistive load. Additionally, a 
comparison between the developed controllers is performed in order to get the best behavior 
available for this applications. 
Introduction 
Control techniques are an area of engineering, which is responsible for obtaining the desired 
behaviors on different processes. This techniques are classified into two groups: linear and 
nonlinear control [1, 2]. In some cases the linear control design requires less effort as compared to a 
non-linear design, but if this are applied to nonlinear systems, linear control is restricted in its work, 
to operation points in which the process is linearized, while the nonlinear control is seen as the most 
appropriate to be use, given that the latter requires more computational and economic spending 
compared to other control [3, 4]. So that, the study and knowledge of the systems to be controlled is 
vital to decide if is necessary to implement a nonlinear controller, or finally a linear control operates 
in the same performance range offered by the former [5, 6, 7]. 
Some of the work done in the field of control, is presented in [8], where a comparison is shown 
between linear and nonlinear control, applied to a three-phase rectifier of switches and levels. On 
one hand, the linear control is designed from the linearization rectifier at operation point in a steady 
state, while the nonlinear controller is designed from a feedback linearization approach in order to 
satisfy the requirements of line currents in total harmonic distortion (THD) and direct current (DC) 
voltage regulation for both drivers, with its robustness to disturbances in the network load. This 
work highlights the high yields as a result of control laws in terms of THD, voltage regulation and 
stability at the operation point for which the drivers were calculated. However, under certain 
conditions, it show that the non-linear controller has better performance in lower power ranges, 
where the linear control system loses its stability. 
Control Strategies Design 
Single-phase rectifier bridge configuration complete PWM voltage source. Developing control 
strategies requires the representation of a single-phase rectifier with width pulse modulation and 
resistive load, so in Fig. 1 is shown the scheme of this type of rectifier.

The steady state operation of the single-phase rectifier is characterized by time-varying signals. 
Hence, a linearization performed at the peak values of the sinusoidal current signal, have to be 
evaluated at the point of desired operation. This way the final representation of the linear 
mathematical model is determined, given by Eq. 1 and Eq. 2, and taking into consideration the 
output current of the coil [9].

Once defined the representation of linear model, it is proceeded with the calculation of the handled 
controllers. For the calculation of the PID controllers and the Servo system control, the desired 
poles of the system are placed in a high frequency level, determined by -46052±31416i, 
corresponding to a parameters in the table 1, for a second order system, that means, the system will 
be stabilize with a minimum overshoot and its respond is fast in order to obtain a controllers that 
allows follow the system and its changes rapidly. But in the rectifier, a third-order system is 
obtained, so a transfer function in open loop should be noted, which has an unstable zero in -
107.1609 rad/s, so that one pole is proposed in this frequency to eliminate any instability that is 
present. The aims to calculate the controllers with the parameters mentioned previously, consist in 
obtain a comparison between the controllers and finally to get the best and robust control to apply in 
a rectifier cases.

Control by pole-zero in Discrete-time cancellation. This kind of driver aims to the total 
cancellation of the rectifier and the only behavior that is acquired is defined by a system of first 
order. Therefore, an initial discretization is performed, and then the settling time of the rectifier and 
the number of samples are defined by the Eq. 5. We use 20 samples because is necessary obtain the 
middle of the settling time propose before and get finally a faster response to follow the signals of 
the system in an appropriate way. 
 
tm=

And once the sampling period established, it is proceeded to the discretization of the rectifier. This 
controller requires a system that will be expressed in terms of zero, pole and gain (K) that is 
observed in the Eq.6. 
 
gz= -0.96137z-0.9995
z2-1.999z+0.9991

So the representation of these controllers is given by Eq. 7, wherein the rectifier of the system is 
cancelled in the first half, followed by the desired performance required. Where mz), is defined by 
the equation 8.

For the behavior of the system to work, it have to be stabilized at 20 samples to prevent a process 
overload, and a settling time determined by 5τ. Hence the final formula that characterizes mz, is 
determined by the behavior of a discrete first order system in Eq. 9.

PID in Continuous Time Controller. PID control has three main actions: proportional, integral 
and derivative actions. The proportional action gives the error magnitude and the speed with which 
reference point is reached, this means that, the error in steady state decreases with increasing this 
action; in addition, the response speed, the overshoot and oscillation increases, too; The derivative 
action determines how fast the error signal stabilization is compensated, because this action predicts 
a trend line on how the next value will be and how its corrected, in this case the system stabilizes 
more rapidly. And integral action is that allows us to have zero error in steady state, and when this 
action increases, the oscillations are also increased [10]. 
To develop this method, a choice of the design parameters of the controller are previously selected. 
The desired polynomial is then calculated as described in the Eq. 10.    
 
Pd=s2+0.0313*1011s+3.3308*1011=0 
(10)
This desired polynomial is then matched to the characteristic polynomial, to calculate the 
proportional, integral and derivative constants. For this, the state space representation is replaced by 
the transfer function of the system Gps. To calculate these controllers in continuous time must be 
use the Eq. 11, where the structure of a PID controller is shown.

PID in Discrete-Time Controller. PID discrete-time control works in the same way as PID in 
continuous-time, but this does not work with a so small sample time, this is because the Z transform 
is done. [10]. Whereas, it is necessary to calculate the magnitude and angle of the desired poles. 
Then, it must be change to its Cartesian form. 
After that is necessary multiplying the desired polynomial by one non-dominant pole, to not affect 
the desired conditions of system. Finally, this is represented as shown in the Eq. 12.   
 
Pd=z2+0.001*109z+3.1078*109=0 
(12)
Furthermore, the exponential values of the characteristic and desired polynomials are matched and 
the control variables are calculated, and finally represented in the Eq.13.

Continuous time Servo-system Control. This control is one of the most robust available 
systems, because it accommodates the poles to mitigate the parametric changes and disturbances on 
the system [11]. To calculate this type of controller, it is necessary to use the system in space state 
form representation. The matrices A (system matrix), B (input matrix), C (output matrix) and D 
(coupling matrix), can be expressed in their controllable and observable canonical form. To 
calculate the constants of the feedback state control the Ackermann method is implemented, and if 
the control includes integral constant, then packaged matrices A and B must be used, as shown in 
the Eq. 14.

Ackermann Method. To develop this method should be choice the design poles of the controller 
with witch the polynomial of the Eq. 15 is calculated.

Once this polynomial is obtained,  is replaced by the A matrix and s0 is replaced by the identity 
matrix, from which φA is obtained, like is shown in the Eq. 16. And then it is possible to calculate 
the control constants of controllability, as shown in Eq. 17.

Analysis of Results and Discussion 
System behavior is observed, through the control strategies previously mentioned, at a given input 
by a sinusoidal signal with an amplitude of 180 and frequency of 120π rad/s. The first controller is a 
cancellation of poles and zeros in discrete time, where it was observed in the Fig. 2. In this case, the 
entirety linearized rectifier on the operating point is annulated, and the system of first order have the 
totally behavior, bring to have the system to a sinusoidal performance; but keep in mind that, as the 
456

name implies, these controllers cancel the rectifier for which it was calculated, so if a parametric 
change occurs, this control does not negate the rectifier dynamic completely, so unwanted poles and 
zeros are added to the system radically changing the expected response. This controller is not useful 
to be apply in a rectifier system because the application require a robust control with the ability to 
support rectifier system changes, produce by components variations. 
Subsequent to former analysis, as shown in the Fig. 3, a PID control in continuous time was 
performed, wherein it is seen that the controller effectively acts at each instant time on the system, 
bringing it to have the sinusoidal behavior desired for this type of applications. In addition, unlike 
the previous driver, the structure of PID controller design can generate minor parametric changes to 
the system without generating instability. This is because it has a proportional action that increases 
the speed of response, a derivative action that determines the speed rate at which the signal offset is 
compensated at the stabilization point, and an integral action that allows the system to delete the 
error in steady state. It controller could be apply in a rectifier system because its implementation is 
inexpensive and easy, besides the control signal allows follow the behavior of a rectifier system. 
Then, as shown in the Fig. 4, the controller to be designed resulted to be a PID controller in discrete 
time that follow the sinusoidal signal with a delay of one sample. This behavior occurs because by 
being discrete, this control system corrects the behaviors after each sample time generating a shift in 
the signal. 
Finally, as shown in the Fig 5, the design of a servo controller in continuous time is performed, an 
identical behavior of the sinusoidal reference signal set is obtained. This is the most robust control 
because the control signal is strongly forcing the rectifier to behave as desired behavior; it is also a 
control that responds very fast and self-compensates the poles to mitigate parametric changes and 
system disturbances. Additionally, it has an integral action in its structure which forces the system 
to stabilize at the desired reference. This control shows a more robust performance than the PID in 
continuous time, which has small peaks in the output signal and, more robust than the controller for 
pole-zero cancellation, because this responds well to any parametric change generated in the 
system.

capable of generating desired behaviors on the developed application. Additionally, it was 
determined that the best driver for this process is the servo system in continuous time model, 
because it has a better reference tracking capacity, and the integral constant can properly extend the 
operating ranges for which it was designed, rendering an excellent tool that, despite of developed on 
a linear system with restricted operating points, it generates a strong signal for the nonlinear system.

Abstract. Centrifugal compressors are critical rotating equipments in industrial processes, 
especially for natural gas applications. Compressible gas exhibit complex flow behavior that 
requires a thorough understanding to ensure extended, safe and stabilized compressor performance. 
Without, Centrifugal compressors can undergo surge which restricts compressor operational range 
and jeopardize the safety of its components. Dynamic simulation then becomes necessary to 
evaluate performance and to implement integrated control schemes. This paper will investigate how 
centrifugal compressor responds to changes at inlet conditions i.e. increase in pressure, temperature 
and molecular weight. The effect of these changes on compressor performance will be simulated 
using Unisim Design dynamic compressor model. Results show that compressor operation is easily 
influenced by changes in inlet condition and that integrated control schemes are effective in 
safeguarding compressor from surge.   
Introduction: Compressors are mechanical devices utilized for the purpose of increasing pressure 
of a gas through means of changing volume or velocity. They are classified mainly into two 
categories, positive displacement and continuous flow compressors. Positive displacement type 
includes reciprocating and rotary in which rotary compressors are further classified as sliding vane, 
liquid piston, helical lobe, and straight lobe. Second type is continuous flow that includes dynamic 
and ejector, dynamic type include centrifugal, axial or mixed flow compressor.[1] Positive 
displacement compressors deal with low flow rates but can achieve higher discharge pressures. 
They operate by decreasing the volume of fluid inside a confined cylinder, hence increase its 
pressure. On the other hand, continuous flow compressors deal with high flow rates but lower 
discharge pressures and operate by transforming gas velocity into static pressure energy.  
Centrifugal compressors, also called radial, contain rotating impellers and diffusers that deem fluid 
flow perpendicular to the rotating shaft. When compared among continuous flow compressors, 
centrifugal compressors are preferred in oil and natural gas platforms because of their ability to 
produce high pressure ratios with fewer stages. When compared to positive displacement 
compressors, industrial centrifugal compressors handle larger volumes of gas but generate less 
pressurized fluids and they are typically lower in price and maintenance cost. However, the useful 
operating range of a centrifugal compressor is limited by an unsteady flow phenomenon that occurs 
at low mass flow rates i.e. surge; and at high flow rates i.e. choke. [2] Centrifugal compressors are 
applied to a wide range of natural gas applications. Examples of upstream applications are gas lift 
and gas injection compressors, for downstream applications it can be found in refineries and power 
generation plants and for midstream processes the compressor is used for transportation and storage 
processing.[3] 
 
Surge phenomena Surge is 1-dimensional system instability and occurs in compressible 
fluid flow systems. Surge is highly undesirable during operation and causes damage to compressor 
components; especially to impellers and bearings. Surge imposes complete reversal of flow inside 
the compressor occurring in a fast periodical manner. A performance map shown in Fig.1 defines 
compressor operation relating head to flow at different constant rotational speeds N. The map is 
fixed to specific suction conditions i.e. pressure, temperature and molecular weight hence it is 
crucial for off-design operation. [4].

Centrifugal compressors performance is mechanically restricted by low flow rates i.e. surge point 
and high flow rate i.e. choke point. Running the compressor beyond such limits causes unstable 
operation leading to damage or failure. The stable region is in between where operation is 
favorable. The operating point usually lies on a constant speed curve revealing values of certain 
head and flow. Performance maps from vendors include contour efficiency lines within the stable 
region. The operating point of maximum efficiency is not far from the surge limit. Therefore, it is 
crucial that surge avoidance and control systems are implemented to avoid compressor surging and 
to ensure maximum-efficiency performance.[5] 
 
As noted before, the map is constructed for specific inlet conditions. In gas field processes, these 
conditions are continuously prone to change which alters the behavior of the operating point. 
Hence, the map must be integrated to account for off-design conditions using dynamic simulation. 
Operating the compressor at off-design makes the behavior of the operating point very 
unpredictable which requires that the dynamic model employs some sort of control and regulation 
technique. Compressors in general can be controlled by several modes namely; Variable inlet vanes, 
Suction or Discharge throttling, Variable speed and Bypass regulation.[1] 
 
Compressor dynamic model: A 3-stage compressor was modeled using Unisim Design R400. 
Each stage requires an intercooler and a suction scrubber. The compressor model is equipped with 
an integrated control scheme to regulate performance and guarantee surge protection. Conventional 
PID controller's arrangement imposes Capacity control combining two modes of Variable speed and 
Bypass regulation. Capacity control is also supplemented by Anti-surge control system ASCS as a 
back-up solution. The centrifugal compressor has a minimum and maximum speed of 13000RPM 
and 15700RMP; respectively. 
  
Figure.2 summarizes the configuration of the integrated control scheme. A compressor stage K-
0523 and its driver M are indicated along with red lines to represent capacity control, green lines to 
represent ASCS. Black blocks are calculation blocks and grey blacks are selector blocks. PI and FI 
are pressure and flow indicators; respectively, used to calculate a value termed as Anti-surge 
parameter ASP using Eq.1.

Where C1 and C2 are coefficient derived from vendor performance map and flow transmitter data. 
ASP value represents operating point distance to surge and the minimum ASP out of all compressor 
stages is utilized. The output of the pressure controllers (PC) at compressor suction and discharge 
will be sent to a low selector block where the outcome is compared with the minimum load 
controller value in a high a selector block. The output of the low selector is designated as B1. The 
minimum load value is a handhold block set to give an output of 36% and designated as B2. When 
B1 and B2 are evaluated in the high selector block, B2 is usually selected and sent to the capacity 
controller. The capacity controller employs the minimum ASP value as its set point to give a certain 
output %. The output is converted for the driver M to RPM using Eq.2: 
 
Eq.2 
   %  27  13000 
 
 
In case the Minimum ASP value falls below 36%, it means compressor speed change is no longer 
effective. This sends the minimum ASP value to the Anti-surge valve ASV controller. The amount 
of flow recycle that must be recycled to increase the ASP value is determined by the master 
capacity control MCC calculation block. The MCC calculation block sends output % to the valve 
actuator through a high selector block and it is calculated using values of B1 and B2 according to 
Eq.3:

As shown in the figure, the high selector block before the actuator also receives an output from the 
ASV controller in which its set point is at always at 33%. In case the Minimum ASP value falls 
below 33%; the ASV controller will override MCC and will behave aggressively to increase 
operating point distance to surge (ASP) bringing the compressor to the stable operating range.

Simulation scenarios: The scenarios simulated will analyze the behavior of the compressor for two 
cases: constant speed and variable speed. The two cases are chosen to reveal the effect of having 
capacity control on compressor operation. The scenarios investigated inlet conditions changes of 
pressure, temperature and molecular weight. Strip charts for compressor suction and discharge 
process parameters as well as compressor characteristics were generated and analyzed for the two 
cases giving an understanding of parameter relations and their effect on compressor operating point. 
The resulting performance maps for the total of 6 scenarios are presented from figure 3-8.  
Pressure increase at a constant compressor speed  
 
Increasing suction pressure had no impact on 
molecular weight but slightly decreased 
temperature. Density on the other hand was 
increased which led to huge increase in 
compressor 
flow 
rates. 
Moreover, 
temperature is proportional to head values 
which caused the dynamic head to decrease. 
This shifted the operating point on the 
performance map to the bottom right along 
the corresponding constant speed curve as 
shown in Fig.3. If high pressure change is 
applied; the compressor can eventually 
choke. 
 
Temperature increase at a constant compressor speed 
 
Increasing the temperature had no impact on 
molecular weight but slightly decreased the 
pressure. 
Temperature 
is 
inversely 
proportional to density consequently lead to 
decrease in compressor flow rates. The head 
was increased which shifted the operating 
point to top left corner on the performance 
map along a constant speed curve as shown 
in Fig.4. If high temperature change is 
applied; the compressor goes into surge 
 
 
Molecular weight increase at a constant compressor speed 
 
Increasing the molecular weight led to 
decrease in both discharge pressure and 
temperature. This resulted in higher gas 
density and consequently higher compressor 
flow rates. Pressure and temperature are 
proportional to head; hence, head was 
decreased shifting the operating point to 
bottom right on the performance map. If 
higher molecular weight is applied; the 
compressor can be choked.

Pressure increase at a variable compressor speed  
 
Increasing pressure had no impact on 
molecular weight but slightly decreased 
temperature. As a consequence, density 
increased which should cause higher flow 
rates. The head values slightly decreased. 
However, tracking the operating point, 
flow rates rather decreased which is 
justified as compressor slows down to 
maintain lower flow moving from a high 
speed curve to a lower one as indicated in 
the Fig.6 
 
 
 
 
Temperature increase at a variable compressor speed  
 
Increasing the temperature caused molecular 
weight to slightly increase with a noticeable 
increase in pressure. Density on the other 
hand decreased and consequently lower 
compressor flow was attained. Although 
temperature increased, the head in this 
scenario was reduced. The effect of the 
speed controller has kicked demanding the 
compressor to slow down to reduce the 
head.  
 
 
 
 
 
Molecular weight increase at a variable compressor speed  
 
Increasing the molecular weight decreased 
both temperature and pressure. Density was 
increased which should increase compressor 
flow rates. This was not the case as the 
effect of the speed controller persisted. 
Head is inversely proportional to molecular 
weight and therefore decreased. This 
resulted in operating point being shifted to 
bottom left of the map to a lower speed 
curve as shown in the performance map 
Fig.8.

Summary: The centrifugal compressor studied in this paper consists of 3 stages regulated by 
capacity control and protected by anti-surge system. Implementing an integrated control scheme 
with variable compressor speed controller helps regulate head and flow values and keep the 
operating point on a safe-efficient regime on the performance map. This is important to increase the 
operational envelop of the compressor by preventing surge and choke phenomenon. Simulation 
shows that even small changes in inlet conditions can cause serious process upsets. From analysis, a 
couple of remarks can be made towards compression process parameter interaction. First of all, 
head is proportional to temperature and discharge pressure but it is inversely proportional to suction 
pressure and molecular weight. Secondly, compressor flow rates are dependent on density. If 
density increases, mass flow and actual flow rates will consequently increase. Moreover, the power 
consumed by the compressor mimic the behavior of actual flow rates and hugely depends on it. At 
constant speed scenarios and in cases where actual flow rates rise, power also rises. At variable 
speed scenarios however, the effect of flow rates fluctuations is counter acted by the variable speed 
controller in which the compress slows down or speeds up to maintain adequate flow, head, and 
power values.

Abstract. For this study with high originality, some aspects about the sintering behaviour of 
Titanium based alloy used for automotive components are presented. This paper presents the 
experimental results concerning the processing of Ti based alloy by Powder Metallurgy (PM) 
technology. The initial powder mixture consists in TiH2 micrometric powder particles that have 
been combined with some metallic powders for improving the final mechanic-chemicals and 
functional properties for using in the automotive industry. The classical PM route have been applied 
for obtaining a low-cost Ti- alloy.  
As a result it was compulsory to study the parameters that influence the densification process and 
the sintered properties, depending on the sintering temperature. The experimental test results were 
processed using the STATISTICA program. Therefore the influence of these sintering temperatures 
on the height and diameter shrinkages, density and hardness for the alloys based on Ti micrometric 
powders has been studied. 
Introduction 
Titanium and its alloys possess excellent assets, such as: low density, fine mechanical properties 
and corrosion resistance, high chemical stability and good heat transfer properties [1,2]. Because of 
these properties, titanium and titanium alloys have been used in increasingly various domains: 
automotive industry, aerospace, biomedical applications, architecture of buildings, petrochemical 
industry, computer components, emerging applications, etc.[3-4].  For the automotive components 
there are several applications for titanium alloys: crankshafts, valves, screws, bolts, connecting rods, 
pistons, wheel rim, mufflers, bolts, suspension springs and engine components and so on [5]. 
The basic advantages of titanium in terms of the auto industry are the high strength and corrosion 
resistance, low density [6] but, despite these great mechanical and chemical properties a major issue 
represents the high cost of alloys based on Ti relative to other competing materials [7] 
This is the reason that have been looked for methods of achieving titanium based alloys to lower 
the costs of producing them [8].  
In the last decade there has been revived interest in the application of the Powder Metallurgy 
(P/M) route as a cost-effective way for obtaining components from this metal [9- 11]. 
Also, by using PM technique different compositions and excellent microstructures can be 
obtained for manufacturing various shapes of Ti products [12] for automotive components.  
Recent researches have revealed the advantages’ of titanium hydride powder (TiH2) used as 
precursor material for Ti powders [12-14] obtaining.  
The main benefits of TiH2 consists, on the one hand, in the low-cost of  titanium hydride powder 
compared to pure-Ti [15, 16] and on the other hand, its behaviour known as  dehydrogenation [17] 
which appears during heating/sintering.  
Thus, the approach for this study is to obtain a low-cost Ti-alloys by using titanium hydride 
powder as raw material and processing by Powder Metallurgy route.

Raw Materials  
Micronic titanium hydride powder (TiH2) particles having a grain-size distribution less than 100 
µm, water atomized, was used as precursor material for obtaining Ti powder. The TiH2 is produced 
by Chemetall GmbH and contains the following chemical components: Titanium (min 95%), 
hydrogen (min. 3.8%), nitrogen (max.0.3%), Si (max.015%), Al (max.0.15%), Fe, Ni, Cl, Mg, C, Ni 
(all the last component are under 0.1%).  
Some metallic components have been added by mixing in titanium hydride powder. The mixing 
time was 60 min in a Planetary Mono Mill PULVERISETTE 6 classic line from Fritsch with 250 ml 
grinding bowl, rotational speed of main disk of 200 rpm, argon atmosphere, ball:powders ratio 1.1, 
balls material stainless steel – 1.3541 ISO/EN/DIN codeX47Cr14, B50. These mixing parameters 
have been chosen for obtaining a homogenized mixture, not an alloyed one. The weight ratio 
between the components is: 80%wt. TiH2, 8%wt.Mn, 6%wt. Alumix321, 3%wt.Sn, 2%wt. Zr and 
1%wt. C. In table 1 the physical properties of each element of the mixture are presented.

Experimental Procedures 
After homogenization, the mixture has been compacted by unilateral cold compaction as 
specimens with 12,05mm in a metallic die at 600MPa compaction pressure on the A009 
electromechanical-computerized 100 kN testing machine equipped with TCSoft2004Plus software. 
After obtaining the compacts, the green density of the specimens has been determined by measuring 
their dimensional sizes and weighing them to an analytical balance, and then, the density formula 
for cylindrical parts has been applied. The green compacts were sintered in argon atmosphere (99.98 
% purity) at different sintering temperatures: 10000C, 10500C, 11000C and 11500C for 30 minutes 
dwell time. In Fig.2 the sintering treatement for 1100 0C is shown.

From Fig.2 it can be noticed that the temperature was increased step by step with 500C with a 
dwell time on each level of 5 minutes. Also, the dwell time  was 30 minutes when the maximum 
sintering temperature of 11000C  has been reached. The sintering treatment was carried out in argon 
atmosphere (99.98 % purity) using a laboratory Nabertherm chamber furnace having temperature 
controller on the front panel and protective gas connection on the rear wall. 
 
Experimental Results 
During the sintering process the precursor material has suffered a dehydrogenation process 
resulting Ti80Mn8Al6Sn3Zr2C1 alloy.  The first analysed property for the Ti80Mn8Al6Sn3Zr2C1 
alloys in sintered state was the height and diameter shrinkage variation. It is mentioned that the 
values of shrinkage were calculated after sintering treatment compared with the dimensional values 
obtained after compaction. Thus, in Fig.3 the graphical dependencies of the height and diameter 
shrinkage variations upon sintering temperature for the Ti80Mn8Al6Sn3Zr2C1 alloys are shown.  
Height Shrinkage = -0.0392+0.0228*x-0.0127*x^2

From Fig.3 it can be observed that the shrinkage height variation of the parts presents a downside 
slope. This behaviour means that after sintering treatment the height of the parts became smaller 
with increasing the sintering temperature, which confirms the densification process of the 
Ti80Mn8Al6Sn3Zr2C1 alloys. On the other hand, the variation of the diameter shrinkage relative to 
the sintering temperature has an ascending slope. It is assumed that this phenomenon has appeared 
because of the TiH2 dehydrogenation/decomposition process during sintering under argon 
atmosphere. There are three stages of decomposition, when TiH0,2 passing in Ti  and the 
accumulation of argon on the surface of formed titanium powder was occurred until 1200 0C, when 
the mass sample increases at 125.9 % of initial mass of specimen [18]. 
 Also, the final density for the Ti80Mn8Al6Sn3Zr2C1 sintered alloys has been studied. The final 
density after sintering was calculated by applying the same method of determining it as well as in 
the case of green density. In Fig. 4 the influence of the sintering temperature on the final density for 
the pieces from TiH2 based alloy is presented. Also, a comparative analysis between the values 
obtained after compacting and sintering density is given in Fig.4.

From Fig.4 minor differences between the green and sintered density values for the 
Ti80Mn8Al6Sn3Zr2C1 pieces can be observed, especially for the specimens sintered at 1050 0C 
when the otherness between these two values of density is extremely small, respectively 3.573 
g/cm3 the value of green density and 3.574 g/cm3 for the final density. A more significant difference 
was registered for parts sintered at 1150 0C (3.583 g/cm3 for green density and 3.628 g/cm3 for 
sintered density) that means over 91% of the full density after sintering. This behaviour is because 
the compaction was done with a high value of compaction pressure and subsequently, sintering 
regime activated the more pronounced densification of the Ti80Mn8Al6Sn3Zr2C1 specimens for 
the values of over 11000C. Also, it can be noticed that the final density of the Ti based alloys parts 
increases along the enhancement of the sintering temperature value. Accordingly [18] the sintering 
process of TiH2 in Ar atmosphere leads to mass growth until 12000C occurs simultaneously with the 
sample shrinkage. Obviously, the density after sintering increases, too.  
From Fig. 4 is observed that the final density of the parts reached over 90% of the theoretical 
density after sintering at higher temperatures than 11000 C, so the densification process has 
occurred, which according to [12] allows the use the Ti80Mn8Al6Sn3Zr2C1 alloy to achieve 
automotive components.  
Another analysed property for the Ti80Mn8Al6Sn3Zr2C1 sintered alloys was the micro-
hardness. Micro hardness of the TiH2 based alloy materials was determined using a micro-Vickers 
hardness tester Namicon CV-400DTS, time pressing 15sec. and load of 100g. The experimental test

results about micro-hardness values obtained for were processed using the STATISTICA program. 
In Fig.4 the influence of the sintering temperature on Ti80Mn8Al6Sn3Zr2C1 material micro-
hardness values is shown. From Fig.4 can be observed that there is a slight increasing of the 
hardness until 1100 0C and then this parameter decreases about 23% with the increase of the 
sintering temperature values. Also, according to Fig.5, the equation that gives the dependency of 
micro-hardness with sintering temperature is: 
 
HV = -31935.75 + 59.7742 · T – 0.0275 · T2   
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) 
 
where: HV is the micro-hardness of Ti80Mn8Al6Sn3Zr2C1 materials;   
T represents the sintering temperature. 
This means that the densification process is almost finished at 1100 ºC and higher sintering 
temperatures values do not improve the hardness.

Conclusions 
Based on the results presented, the following data can be stated:  
- 
At sintering temperatures greater than 11000 C higher density values have been achieved, 
over 90% of the full density that certifies the densification process, which confirmed the 
quality of the Ti80Mn8Al6Sn3Zr2C1alloy to be used for automotive components.  
- 
The Ti80Mn8Al6Sn3Zr2C1 material behaviour after sintering proved that around 11000C the 
maximum value of micro-hardness has been reached.  
- 
By using TiH2 as precursor material the densification process seems to be achieved at 
11000C, the final properties of the developed alloy are comparable to those presented in 
[5,10,12] materials used for automotive components. 
- 
The use of titanium hydride powder as raw material has provided the right conditions for 
obtaining an alloy for automotive components, and allowed that the densification process has 
been performed at lower sintering temperatures than those required in the case of alloys based 
on pure Titanium. 
- 
The selection mode of technological route and parameters led to obtaining final parts with 
properties comparable to those in the technical literature.

Abstract. To determine the friction forces and friction coefficient in dry and lubricated conditions 
between steel and a triol crosslinked polyurethane, the authors developed a new experimental 
method consist in sliding of a steel cylinder on a plate polymer sample in the direction of the 
cylinder axis. By using this method the experiments were realized on a deformed path in the 
polymer sample by maintaining the same pressure distribution between the contact elements during 
the experiments. The experiments were realized with normal load between 1 N and 8 N and a cyclic 
linear speed having values between 1mm/s and 10 mm/s. Were determined the friction forces and 
friction coefficients in dry and lubricated contacts. An analytical model to evaluate the friction force 
in the cylinder – polymer contact surface has been developed and a good correlation with the 
experiments was obtained. 
Introduction 
A lot of applications of the polymers are used in present in robotics and mechatronics devices 
both at macro and micro scale. The polymer layers applied on silicon or metal surfaces are used as 
good solution to reduce the sliding friction in micro turbines, micro motors, micro pumps. Also, in 
hydraulic and pneumatic actuators the uniformity of the motion is correlated with the constant value 
of the friction force between the contact elements including the polymers [1]  
To determine the friction coefficient of the polymers is a complex problem due to minimum two 
factors: the experimental methods to evaluate friction coefficient and the chain mobility of the 
polymer structure as a result of the contact stress, speed, temperature [2]. Usually, for macro scale 
the friction coefficient is determined by pin – disc machine and for micro –scale by using AFM 
technique [2]. Gustafson [3] experimentally investigated the static and dynamic friction coefficients 
for 7 polymers types (Polyoxymethylene and Polyamides) by using steel sphere on plane polymers 
contacts in linear cyclic movements. For a normal load of 60 N and a steel ball having 8 mm 
diameter, Gustafson obtained values between 0.15 to 0.5 for static friction coefficient and between 
0.05 to 0.3 for dynamic friction coefficient, as function of the polymer type. By using the ball-
polymer contact in sliding motion, the tangential force is a sum between friction process and elastic 
deformation of the polymer in the front of the ball. Barnea et al. [4, 5] developed a new 
methodology to determine the friction coefficient by using a rigid cylinder in contact with human 
skin and elastomer, sliding motion being in the axial direction of the cylinder. By this method is 
avoiding the elastic deformation in the front of the cylinder, the contact deformation of the 
elastomer having the same configuration during the sliding process. Recently, by using the contact 
between a rigid cylinder and a plane sample of elastomer, Rusu et al. [6] evaluated both adherence 
with elastic deformation and sliding between the two elements. 
In the present paper authors determined by experiments the friction forces and friction coefficient 
between a steel cylinder and a plane sample of polyurethane and developed an analytical model to 
validate the experimental results

Experimental setup and test procedure  
The experiments were realized by using the Tribometer CETR UMT-2 from the Laboratory of 
Tribology. The tests were realized by using sliding contact between a chrome steel cylinder used in 
needle bearings and polymer sample. 
    In Fig.1 is presented the general view of the Tribometer with the cylinder and polymer sample 
mounted. The cylindrical objects are fixed on the top of the pin and the pin is mounted in the forces 
sensor of the Tribometer. The sensor indicates the values both for normal force Fz and tangential force 
in sliding contact Fx. On the linear table of the Tribometer was mounted the elastomer sample and the 
cylinder is put in contact with the sample, as is presented in Fig. 2. The sample realizes linear cyclic 
displacement in one direction and in opposite direction. The tangential forces Fx between cylindrical 
object and polymer having positive and negative values (depending of the sliding direction) are 
registered in the computer of the Tribometer. The diameter of the cylinder has 5 mm with surface 
roughness of Ra = 0.06µm. The length of the cylinder is 15 mm and during the tests the cylinder is in 
continuum contact with the polymer. The dimensions of the polymer sample were: 30 mm length, 10 
mm width and 0.8 mm thickness with a roughness Ra = 0.14 µm. The sample of the polymer is fixed 
on the table of the tribometer so that the contact with the cylinder is realized on the width of 10mm. 
The normal loads Fz varied between 1 N to 8 N and sliding speed v varied between 1 mm/s to 10 
mm/s. 
 The tests were realized both in dry and in lubricated conditions. For lubricated conditions was used 
mineral oil having dynamic viscosity of 0.35 Pas.

The tested polyurethane was realized by „Petru Poni“ Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry 
from Iaşi. It was prepared by the reaction of dibenzyl diisocyanate with poly(ethylene adipate) 
glycol, using diethylene glycol and trimethylol propane as chain extender and crosslinker in toluene-
dichloromethane solution. The mechanical characteristics of polymer sample are Break stress = 
24.92 MPa, Break strain = 254.1%, E = (20 – 40) MPa and maximum temperature of Tmax = 3000C.

Experimental results for contact between cylinder and polymer sample 
 
Some types of registrations have been obtained for all the experiments.  
First type of registration includes the variation of the tangential force Fx, friction coefficient 
COF and linear displacement Y as function of the time as is presented in Fig.3.  
 
 
 
Fig. 3 The registration of the tangential forces Fx, friction coefficient COF and linear 
displacement Y for normal load Fz = 8N and linear speed v = 1mm/s 
The tangential force Fx have positive and negative values as function of the direction of the 
linear displacement Y. In the diagrams from Fig. 3 it can be observe that at the start of the motion in 
a direction or in opposite direction the tangential force have a pick that corresponds to the static 
friction coefficient. At the normal force of 8 N it can be observed approximate constant values both 
for Fx and for friction coefficient on all strokes that means the dominance of the sliding with a 
constant friction between the cylinder and polymer sample. At the end of the strokes the tangential 
force Fx changes the sense and friction coefficient presents a pronounced decreases to zero that is 
not a really value.To evidence only the variation of the friction coefficient as function of the 
displacement Y, a specific type of diagrams are presented in Fig. 4. 
 
Fig. 4 Variation of the friction coefficient COF as function of linear displacement Y for                         
Fz = 8 N and linear speed v = 10 mm/s 
 
For the experiment presented in Fig. 4 the values of dynamic friction coefficient correspond to 
the middle zone are between (0.12 – 0.15), excepting the ends. At the ends of the strokes the friction 
coefficients have decreasing zones that corresponds to the change of the sliding directions. 
    Two parameters were modified in these experiments: normal load Fz and linear speed. The 
experimental values of the friction coefficient for normal load Fz between 1 N and 8 N and for

linear speed between 1 mm/s to 10 mm/s evidenced that at a normal load Fz =1 N increasing of the 
linear speed from 1 mm/s to 10 mm/s leads to decreases of the average friction coefficient from 0.3 
to 0.18. At Fz = 8N, increasing of the speed from 1 mm/s to 10 mm/s has not important influence of 
the average friction coefficient, the values of COF being between 0.1 – 0.15.  
For all experiments in dry conditions the friction coefficient varied between 0.08 and 0.3. 
 Influence of the lubricant on friction coefficient 
     In Fig. 5 are presented the variations of the friction coefficient between steel cylinder and 
polymer sample in dry and lubrication conditions, for normal load of 8 N and linear speed of 10 
mm/s. It can be observed that in lubricated conditions the friction coefficient has an important 
decreasing up to average value of 0.04.   
 
 
Fig. 5 Comparison between the friction coefficient in dry and lubricated conditions for normal load 
Fz = 8 N and speed v = 10 mm/s 
 
      For geometrical configuration (cylinder on plane surface) and sliding motion in axial direction 
of the cylinder, the hydrodynamic effect can be neglected and lubrication regime can be supposed to 
be one limit. That means a very good adherence of the mineral oil to the polymer surface. 
 
Analytical model of the friction between a cylinder and a plane polymer surface 
First approximation of the contact between the steel cylinder and plane polymer surface is based 
on the Hertz theory. So, for a contact between a cylinder having radius R and a plane as in Fig. 6  
the half width of the contact b  is determined by equation:

where normal load Q =Fz , E1, E2 are the Young modulus of the steel cylinder and the polymer,

To estimate the total tangential force Fx between cylinder and polymer was considered the 
deformed surface having a length L and a circular segment lc evaluated as function of cylinder 
radius R and half width of the contact b as function of normal force Fz, by equation:

 Eq. (4) was solved for three values of friction coefficient in the contact (0.1, 0.15 and 0.2) and

To validate the theoretical model two variations of the friction coefficient and friction force 
obtained for a normal load Fz = 8 N in dry condition for sliding speed of 10 mm/s are presented in 
Figure 8. In fig. 8, for a normal load Fz =8 N and friction coefficient between (0.1 – 0.15), the 
friction force measured varied between (0.8 – 1.25) N. Analytical values of Ff for the same normal 
load and friction coefficients are between (1 – 1.35) N. It can be observed that exist small variations 
between experiments and theoretical model. These differences can be explained by the 
approximation with the Hertzian behavior of the contact between steel cylinder and polymer.  
The maximum contact pressure pmax has values between 0.7 MPa for Fz = 1 N and 2 MPa for                
Fz = 8 N.

Summary 
(i) A new methodology to evaluate experimental friction force and friction coefficient between 
cylindrical steel and plane polymer has been developed and experimented by the authors. The 
methodology is based on sliding of a loaded steel cylinder on a plane polymer sample to maintain 
the same pressure distribution during the tests. The experiments were realized with the plane sample 
of polyurethane by using the facilities of the CETR UMT-2 Tribometer.  
(ii) Some experimental diagrams have been obtained according to the soft of the Tribometer to 
evidence both the variations of the friction force and friction coefficient as function of time and as 
function of the linear displacement. 
(iii) An analytical model to evaluate of the friction force as function of normal load and friction 
coefficient has been developed and good agreement with the experiments has been obtained. 
(iv) The experimental results evidenced a good friction behavior between steel and polyurethane 
especially in limit and mixed lubrication regimes, the polymer can be used as antifriction material in 
mechatronic applications.

Abstract. No one wants a material to fail. If it does happen then we have to know what the causes 
are and then what is the intensity at which it fails. Many experimental tests were making for this. 
The laboratory data for the laminated composites fractures normally exhibit scatter. This implies an 
element of uncertainty or vagueness in the results. Fuzzy logic is a natural means of expressing 
vague categories of information through fuzzy sets and offers means of performing logical 
operations. In this paper are considered some aspects regarding laminated composites fractures 
using fuzzy logic methods. The fuzzy logic treatment of the case considered in this work clearly 
show some risk of failures at lower parameter levels than might be expected using a deterministic 
treatment in which the vagueness of knowledge is masked and which might not be safeguard 
against by using a factor of safety value. 
Introduction 
Understanding the behavior of laminated composites to fracture requires a detailed study of the 
mechanisms which take place at interface level. This study approached for the first time by Cook 
and Gordon [1]. They deduced that the fractures are developed at interface level when the ratio 
between the interface resistance and the global resistance of the composite is about 1:20. 
An energetic approach of the problem followed, conducted by Kendall [2]. He considered the 
case of diminishing any elastic module on the direction transverse to the interface.  
There have been a number of significant advances concerning interfacial fracture mechanics [3]. 
For interfaces which are significantly less tough than the neighboring bulk materials, a crack can 
continue to follow an interface, even though the stress intensity at the crack tip is not purely Mode I 
(crack opening) and may have a substantial Mode II (shearing) component. 
A fuzzy logic treatment of fracture on a macroscopic scale is considered in this work. In fuzzy 
logic methodology, uncertainty is naturally accommodate through partitioning of the universes of 
discourse in terms of fuzzy sets which may be, and often are, interpenetrating. The uncertainty is 
therefore incorporated into the treatment and carried through the logic operations to be reflected in 
the conclusions.  
The model of laminated composites fracture 
     In order to estimate the behaviour of laminated composites during fracturing a model was carried 
out wich describes the characteristics of the load and cracking of this type of material. The model is 
based on the following assumptions: 
The succession of events consists of the instant propagation of a crack in the upper layer in the 
thickness direcion followed by the progressive propagation of an interfacial crack between the 
cracked layer and the one beneath (Fig.1.). These mechanisms succeed alternatively until the 
complete fracure of the beam. 
 
The cracks in the material’s thickness appear in the center of the beam’s section while inerfacial 
fractures are symetrically propagated to the center of the beam’s section.

The Fuzzy Logic Current Methodology 
     In the following work a distinction will be drawn between the nominal stress σ and the real stress 
S [4]; σ is the stress derived by the application of continuum mechanics using stress functions, finite 
element method or other analytical techniques with all the assumptions of ideality of the material 
normality implied, and S is the stress on an area large enough to support a valid statistical mean. 
The closest approach of S and σ is achieved in carefully prepared laboratory specimens. 
Background reading in fuzzy logic methods may be found in the introductory text by Harris [5]. 
A basic application of fuzzy sets is in the formation of a transition zone (propagation of the 
cracks in the material’s thickness and interfacial cracks) between two well-defined zones, which in 
the following discussion will be there zones were the cracks is not propagate. 
The trends in the crack’s propagation zone can be figured through the following equation: 
- = 6112.5 −1.33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (7) 
- = 3586.4 −0.83 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (8) 
 
 The two equation (7) and (8) are now considered as representing two fuzzy sets on the S (stress) 
universe of discourse. Further, define membership functions µ1 and µ2 which represent the degree 
of membership of Sp and Si. The resulting stress is then given by: 
- = 7- + 7-

Membership values are given in Table 1.

Values of µ1 and µ2 in Table 1 were obtained by the choice of two interpenetrating fuzzy sets 
spanning the loading range from 4145 to 4428 N. It will be found that the values in the S column 
provide a smooth transition between the expression S in equations (8) and (9). 
The uncertainty in the laboratory test data indicates that Sp and Si can be partitioned into four 
fuzzy sets each, as illustrated in Figure 2a and b. The corresponding rule base reflecting opposite 
tendencies in Sp and Si  is shown in Table 2, which defines the fuzzy boundary between safe and 
unsafe stress states [6]. 
From basic solid mechanics theory the nominal bending stress is 566,1MPa and the share stress 
is 22,46MPa. Suppose now that it is desired to determinate the value of P load, corresponding with 
the stress value of 566,1 and 22,46MPa. Figure 3 illustrate the partitioning of the universes of 
discourse P and Table 2, the rule base for the laminated composite Sp ,Si  - P relationship.

Conclusions 
Predicting the in-service fracture characteristics of engineering systems is a complex matter. The 
service loading and environmental patterns may not be known with certainty and, even if they were, 
the methods of relating these to the laboratory patterns are empirical and of limited use. Idealized 
mathematical models of materials too are of limited value because of a range of assumptions 
implied in their development. Fuzzy logic methodology synthesizes insights from idealized models 
trends in laboratory data, human knowledge and experience of similar systems. 
In this paper, to describe the behavior during fracturing from the three point bend of laminated 
composites specimens, a fuzzy model was elaborated, capable to evaluate the maximum bending 
load suffered by the material without failure. 
The uncertainty of input data is reflected in the conclusions in membership form of fuzzy                 
sets. As a final result, a single value can be chosen. In design, the reliability of a system or 
component is judged by how far, if at all, the conditions penetrate the fuzzy boundary which defines 
its safe limits. 
To validate the model, tests were made on 10 specimens of STICLOSTRATITEX composite, 
obtaining results with values close to the ones estimated through modeling (maximum load 
estimated was Pmax=4250N, while the average value of the experimental load was Pmax=4265N).

Keywords: polyamide, friction coefficient, dry friction, tribometer, tests. 
Abstract. The paper presents the determination of the friction coefficient for the polyamide / steel 
type contacts in the case of dry friction. First, there are presented the characteristics of the testing 
equipments and the test procedure. According to the results, there are presented recommendations 
for the applicability of the tested polyamide material.  
Introduction 
Dry friction in mechanical contacts appears in the technical applications where the lubrication is 
not allowed, due to some properties of the lubricant – toxicity (in food industry), its non sterile 
environment (in medical instruments), staining behavior (in furniture and house decorations 
manufacturing). 
In order to reduce the friction in the steel/steel type contacts, one of the mechanical elements is 
made by polyamide due to its small friction properties in combination with a steel made mechanical 
part [1] and due to its good mechanical behavior – high endurance and small deformation in the 
case of high loadings [2, 3]. 
The studies related to the friction coefficient of the polyamide – steel type contacts are mainly 
oriented to the lubricated contacts due to the wide area of applicability of these materials in power 
transmissions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. 
This paper presents the comparatively experimental study of the dry friction coefficient for the 
PA4.6 and PA6.6 polyamide/steel type contacts by considering as input parameters the variation of 
the temperature and of the relative speed. 
The testing procedure 
The equipments. The equipment used for the test is presented in Fig. 1; the equipment contains a 
UMT tribometer produced by Brucker Nano Inc. and a computer used for the data acquisition. The 
tribometer allows motions of the holder about to axis – the vertical axis and the lateral positioning 
axis. The normal force can be set up by the user as a constant or variable value; this load and the 
tangential load are measured during the tests. The friction coefficient is calculated automatically by 
the acquisition software as the ratio between the tangential force and the normal force. 
The device from bellow, mounted in the tribometer allows rotational motions with constant or 
sets of velocities, due to a DC motor and a synchronous belt transmission used to obtain accuracy of 
the motions. The disk shape polyamide elements are mounted inside this rotary module which has a 
tank for the lubricant; this tank can be heated up, with lubricant or without it, by controlling the 
temperature.  
The OL 60 steel plates are mounted in the holder which is acting with the desired pushing force 
on the polyamide disks – Fig. 2; the polyamide disks are made by PA6.6 and PA4.6 – Fig. 3. The 
polyamide materials are produced by Schaeffler Group and their mechanical properties, due to 
confidential reasons of the company, are not public information.

The test program. There are performed 2 sets of tests. 
In the first set, the input parameters are: the constant normal load F=5 N, and the rotational speed 
as set of v = 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000 rpm and the environmental 
temperature of T = 20o C.

In the second set of tests, the input parameters are represented by: the constant rotational speed 
of v = 1000 rpm, the constant normal load F = 9 N and the temperature between T = 30 … 90o C. 
The results 
In the Fig. 4 is presented, as percentage related to the PA4.6 polyamide, the variation of the 
friction coefficient for the PA6.6 polyamide with the rotational speed, for a contact with a steel 
plate. For small rotational speeds – smaller than approx. 2500 rpm, the PA6.6 has a better frictional 
behavior (the friction coefficient is smaller than the case of the PA4.6 polyamide / steel type 
contact). Due to confidential reasons of the Schaeffler Group, the values of the friction coefficients 
are not public information. 
In the case of the temperature’s variation – see Fig. 5 – the PA6.6 polyamide’s friction 
coefficient for a contact with a steel plate is decreasing starting with the increasing of the 
temperature from the value of approx. 75 oC, as percentage related to the PA4.6 polyamide. 
In the Fig. 6 is presented the percentage variation of the PA4.6 and PA6.6 friction coefficients 
relative to the friction coefficients values at 5 rpm; the PA6.6 polyamide has a more stabile

variation of the friction coefficient with the rotational speed (up 15% at 3000 rpm) than the PA46’s 
friction coefficient; the graph presents the trend lines variation, so this is the reason why the value 
of the friction coefficient at 5 rpm is not 1.

increasing value of the friction coefficient with the temperature and the variation is up to approx. 
50% ar 90 oC relative to the value at 30 oC. The PA6.6 polyamide has a more stabile variation of the 
friction coefficient with the temperature (a maximum of 25% at approx. 60 oC).

Summary 
The testing equipments and the testing procedure presented in the paper are suitable to be applied 
in any testing which has the aim to determine the variation of the friction coefficient with the 
rotational speed and the temperature for different materials being in contact. 
The results are indicating that the PA6.6 polyamide is recommended to be used in combination 
with steel plates instead of the PA4.6 polyamide in the case of machine elements with rotational 
speeds smaller than approx. 2500 rpm and for temperatures higher than approx 75 oC. 
The PA6.6 polyamide has a more stabile variation of the friction coefficient with the rotational 
speed and the temperature.

Abstract. The defects or micro-cracks that exist in a product mass from the elaboration phase, can 
extend controlled or not, because of a variable solicitation applied to a product or a sample. The 
Fracture Mechanics parameter that highlight the crack propagation in time is its rate growth marked 
as da/dN and represents the crack advancement length during a solicitation cycle. This can be 
studied based on some mathematical models obtained from some propose models, experimentally 
determined. In this paper, a propagation process analysis is made of a fracture crack by an axial-
eccentric fatigue loading for a X6CrNiTi18-10 (from the standard SR EN 100027/1,2:1996) 
stainless steel. CT type flat samples were loaded with an asymmetry coefficient R= 0.3, for the 
solicitation temperatures: T= 293K (200C), T= 253K (-200C), respectively T= 213 K (-600C). The 
crack growth increase was studied by three most used mathematical models: the polynomial method 
standardized according to ASTM E647, method proposed by P.C. Paris and method proposed by 
E.K. Walker. 
Introduction 
 
The materials fatigue phenomenon is determined by applying a time variable loading to a 
product or sample. This loading produces a stress solicitation variation between two limits σmin and 
σmax. This existence state during the working time contributes to the defects development that exist 
in the material, or to the appearance of new ones, whose propagation ways are united and form a 
main crack which advances in the element mass leading in the end to the product fatigue fracture.  
A control of the fracture process is made by following the crack growth rate, or crack rate, 
marked as da/dN analyzed in relation with the crack length variation a or the stress intensity factor 
ΔK. This is a complex quantity which takes into consideration simultaneously both the loading 
stress σ and the defect length variation a. It has an empiric calculus relation with the form from Eq. 
1 [1], [3], [5], [6].

or the breaking tenacity are highlighted. 
The experimental procedure 
The order to achieve the paper goal, fatigue tests were made on CT type samples, made from 
X6CrNiTi18-10 stainless steel, [8], [13]. The tests were made on a tensile-eccentric fatigue loading 
machine, hydraulic pulsing device type, with the possibility of a CA storage room mounting, [8], 
[13]. The loading was made with the asymmetry coefficient R= 0.3, so a positive oscillatory 
solicitation, at the temperatures T= 293 K, T= 253 K and T= 213 K, [8].

The specimens were firstly subjected to an initial crack that is the same with the first domain 
range, making an initial crack a0= 2 mm, and the stress intensity factor being ΔKth. From this 
loading stage, for the loaded samples, at each temperature, the length crack variation ai and the 
number of the corresponding cycles Ni was investigated. At 0.25 mm gaps, successive readings of 
the defect length were made with an optical microscope mounted on the loading machine housing. 
The sample loading was made until its fracture, when the stress intensity factor becomes equal with 
the breaking tenacity Kc.  
The crack growth analysis depending on the proposed mathematical model  
A said above, a crack growth rates da/dN, in three variants, was made by using the relations 
proposed by the authors.  
1°. The polynomial method standardized according to ASTM 
This method is developed according to the ASTM E647-2000, [12] and imposes that on the 
successive gaps of (2n+1) consecutive points of the experimental data, between the Ni cycles 
numbers and the crack lengths ai to be made an approximation of a second degree polynomial 
function with the form given in Eq. 2 (from [2], [8], [10], [12]).

If we impose V1= V2 in some points from the area II in Fig. 1, by using Eq. 6, the material 
constants C2 and m2 can be found [13]. If C2 and m2 are known, then the rate V2 is determined on 
the whole loading domain [13].

In Eq. 7 we have marked with C3, m3 and γ3 material constants. Using the same procedure from 
Paris proposed model and from [13], these material constants can be found. Then, for the crack 
length variation (a), there is determined the rate V3 on the whole domain. 
With the obtained results, the next graphics were drawn: 
- 
the crack growth rates variation, by the three analyzed variants: V1, V2 and V3, versus the 
crack calculated length a1, for the three temperatures, Fig. 1, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3; 
- 
the crack growth rates variation, V1, V2 and V3 versus the SIF ΔK variation, for the three 
temperatures, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.   
Conclusions 
1º. A first conclusion refers to the crack increase rate variation, by the three studied methods, V1, V2 
şi V3, on the same graphics, depending on the crack length variation. It is observed that:  
- 
at T= 293 K, the rate varies from 4.6·10-5 m/cycles up to 10.5·10-5 m/cycles, Fig. 1; 
- 
for T= 253 K, the rate value is between 6.7·10-5 m/cycles and 12.3·10-5 m/cycle, Fig 2; 
- 
for T= 213 K, the rate varies between limits of 13.2·10-5 m/cycle and 47·10-5 m/cycle, Fig. 3; 
It is observed that the temperature decrease determines an increase for the breaking fatigue rate. 
 
2º. A last main conclusion refers to the rates of defect increase ways versus the stress intensity factor 
(SIF) ∆K. It is observed that the temperature decrease produces a SIF increase in this way: 
-       for T= 293 K, ∆K varies from 512 Nmm-3/2 up to 804 Nmm-3/2, Fig. 4; 
-       for T= 253 K, is in the limits of 634 Nmm-3/2  and 958 Nmm-3/2 , Fig. 5; 
-       for T= 213 K, SIF variation is in the gap 76 Nmm-3/2 and 1170 Nmm-3/2, Fig. 6.  
So, generally, the temperature decrease determines a material fragility.  
 
3º. It is also observed that for the 213K (-600C) temperature, the obtained results are more grouped, 
the deviations between the methods are smaller, this aspect appeared due to the material brittleness, 
loosing from its elastically properties. The polynomial method determines a curve with a random 
evolution, because it is directly correlated with the loading experimental character.

Abstract. In this paper we will build some new and original composite sandwich bars reinforced 
with two (one in the upper and the other in the lower side) and four layers of carbon fiber (two in 
the upper and two in the lower side), with the core made of polypropylene honeycomb. Starting 
from the dynamic response of these bars that are in free vibration, we will establish a procedure to 
determine their damping factor per unit mass and per unit length. The bars will have the 
polypropylene honeycomb core with 10 and 15 mm and the width of 45 mm. The bars will be 
clamped at one end and free at the other. We will consider several free lengths of: 200, 230, 260, 
290, 320 and 350 mm. We will highlight how the damping factor will increase if two extra carbon 
fiber layers are added in the upper and lower sides of the sandwich bars. 
Introduction 
The chemical and mechanical properties of carbon fibers like high flexural rigidity, high tensile 
strength, low weight, high chemical resistance, low thermal expansion and high tolerance to 
temperature increased values make them to be widely used in aerospace, civil and mechanical 
engineering, military or sports [1,2,3]. Combined with resins, carbon fibers form composites 
(usually named in literature as CFRP) [1]. The main advantage is having a very high strength-to-
weight ratio. Also the carbon fiber can be used as reinforcement for metal-matrix composites that 
consist of a ductile low strength matrix reinforced with elastic, strong and brittle fibers. In [4], the 
dynamic and quasi-static tensile behaviors of carbon fiber and uni-directional carbon fiber 
reinforced aluminum composite has been investigated. The experimental results have shown that the 
carbon fiber is a strain rate insensitive material, but the tensile strength and critical strain of the 
carbon fiber reinforced aluminum composite increased with the strain rate increasing. The strength 
and modulus of a composite reinforced with carbon fiber is derived especially from the carbon fiber 
reinforcement, because is the major load-bearing part of the material [5,6].   
If changes are brought at the fiber/matrix interface, the properties of composites can be 
significantly changes. Using this technique, in [7], the effective surface area of the fiber/matrix 
interface has been increased in order to help additional stress transfer between fiber and matrix, by 
grafting carbon nano-tubes onto carbon fibers. There have been used two different methods: 
chemical vapor deposition (abbreviated as CVD) and a purely chemical method. At the tensile tests, 
the both used methods revealed improvement for the mechanical properties. In [8] there has been 
highlighted that composite sandwich bars reinforced with carbon fibers have higher stiffness and 
damping properties in comparison with the ones reinforced with glass fibers or steel wire mesh, no 
matter what core is used.

Experimental setup and results 
We have built some new original composite bars made by classical materials (carbon fiber, 
polypropylene honeycomb core and epoxy resin) but combined in a new way. The properties of the 
epoxy resin and polypropylene honeycomb core are the same with the ones used in [9]. The 
properties of the carbon fiber are the same with the ones used in [10]. These composite bars have 
different thickness values (10, 15 mm) and 45 mm width. In order to highlight the influence of extra 
carbon fiber layers over the damping properties, we have considered two different reinforcing 
variants: two sets o samples (different because of the thickness values: 10 and 15 mm) are 
reinforced with one carbon fiber layer in the upper side and one in the lower side; other two sets of 
samples (different because of the thickness values: 10 and 15 mm) are reinforced with two carbon 
fibers layers in the upper side and two in the lower side. A scheme with the used composites is 
presented in Fig. 1. In order to determine the damping factor variation on the bars length, we have 
considered several free lengths values: 200, 230, 260, 290, 320 and 350 mm. The experimental 
setup consists in clamping the bars at one end and leaving them free at the other end, where we have 
placed a Bruel&Kjaer type accelerometer with 0,004 pC/ms-2. The accelerometer records the bars 
free vibrations, which appear after applying an initial force which deforms them. The force is also 
applied at the free end. The accelerometer is connected to a signal conditioner Nexus, and the data 
acquisition is achieved with SPIDER 8, connected with the signal conditioner. Also, the 
experimental data is stored on a notebook, connected with SPIDER 8 through USB port. Similar 
experimental setup was used by the authors in [9], where the logarithmic decrement method was 
also used to obtain proper values for the damping factor and eigenfrequency.  
 
 
Fig. 1. A scheme with the used composites 
 
Using the free vibrations of a bar, the damping factor per unit mass and per unit length can be 
determined using the next steps [9], [10]: 
- there are determined the values where the displacement is zero; 
- there is determined the cancellation movement period (more precisely T is the double time gap 
between two consecutive cancellations); 
- the frequency ν and the pulsation ω are determined with Eq. 1; 
- the damping factor per unit mass is determined with Eq. 2; 
- the damping factor per unit length is determined with Eq. 3.

In fig. 2, the experimental recordings for a sample with one carbon fiber layer and 15 mm thickness 
in the upper side and one in the lower side is presented. In Fig. 3, the experimental determination of 
the damping factor per unit mass for the same sample from Fig. 2 is presented. In Fig. 3, for five 
numbers of cycles (marked by the two vertical dotted lines), the eigenfrequency was determined 
with Eq. 1 and the damping factor was determined with Eq. 2.

Conclusions 
The added value of this paper is building some new composite materials, made from classical 
parts (polypropylene honeycomb core, carbon fiber and epoxy resin) but combined in order to 
obtain a new structure. By analyzing the graphics from Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 we can see that the 
variation of the damping factor per unit mass with the bars free length is an exponential one. 
Calculus relations for the damping factor per unit mass, based on the experimental results and 
regression analysis, are obtained and written in Table 2. Some general conclusions regarding the 
damping factor determination, extracted from this study, can be:  the damping factors analysis show 
that these factors must be experimentally determined for each type of material and sample, being 
difficult to deduce a quantitative correspondence with the parameters which influence the damping 
directly or indirectly;  a correspondence between the damping factor and the bars free length has 
been obtained and direct calculus relations were found; the values of damping factors may depend 
on several features such as: sample dimensions (thickness, bars free length), specific mass, the 
quantity of material from sample, elastic and damping properties of component materials;  the 
sample specific linear mass influence the damping factor by the fact that the samples with higher 
mass and width, the deformation energy which is stored in sample through the initial deformation, is 
dissipated in a larger quantity of material.

From the table 3 we can extract the next general conclusions: 
- if two extra carbon layers are inserted in a sandwich bars (one in the upper side and another 
one in the lower side), the damping factor per unit mass significantly increases (the maximum value 
is of 20.796% obtained for the samples with 10 mm thickness); 
- when there are used two extra carbon fiber layers for reinforcements, there must be taken into 
account that the price of the structure increase and this kind of material (with four reinforcement 
layers) must be used only if high vibrations damping capacity is needed for the structure.

Abstract. In this paper we will build some new and original composite sandwich bars reinforced 
with two and four layers of carbon fiber (in the upper and lower sides), with the core made of 
polypropylene honeycomb. For these sandwich bars, we will use the next experimental setup: we 
will clamp them at one end and we will leave the other free. Using an accelerometer, we will record 
the eigenfrequencies. Bu using the eigenfrequencies values and the Euler-Bernoulli theory, there is 
established a procedure to determine the bars flexural rigidity and dynamic Young modulus. We 
will consider the bars as having 320 and 350 mm free lengths. We will highlight how the two extra 
carbon fiber layers will influence the flexural rigidity values and the dynamic Young modulus. 
Introduction 
 
The carbon fibers have been widely used as reinforcements for composites because they have 
high strength-to-weight ratio. In [1] a carbon fiber reinforced Al-12% Si alloy composite has been 
fabricated by pre-treating the fibers by molten alloy infiltration and hot pressing of the performs. 
The tensile strength of the obtained composite was of 240 MPa. In [2] some carbon fiber 
composites with a metal matrix are presented. Three structure types of carbon metallic materials that 
correspond to insufficient, optimum and excessive interaction of the carbon materials components 
are described. The principles of a quantitative components interaction theory in metallic carbon 
materials fabrication are examined and can be used to estimate the optimum parameters of this 
process. Some mechanical properties of composites reinforced with carbon fibers (the elastic-
strength properties of carbon fibers in unidirectional carbon-filled plastics) are presented in [3]. The 
strength and other properties (elasticity modulus and relative elongation) of high-modulus carbon 
filaments (carbon fibers) are determined from tests performed on the elementary fibers (the 
monofilaments) in [4]. The dynamic and quasi-static tensile behaviors of carbon fiber and 
unidirectional carbon fiber reinforced aluminum composite have been investigated in [5]. The 
experimental results have shown that the carbon fiber is a strain rate insensitive material, but the 
tensile strength and the critical strain of the carbon fiber reinforced aluminum composite increased 
with the increasing of strain rate. Based on the experimental results, a fiber bundles model has been 
combined with Weibull strength distribution function to obtain a one-dimensional damage 
constitutive equation for the carbon fiber reinforced aluminum composite. In [6] there is shown that 
if the effective surface area of the fiber/matrix interface is increased, then additional stress transfer 
between fiber and matrix is facilitated. This was made by using two methods: chemical vapor 
deposition and a purely chemical method. Carbon nanotubes (abbreviated as CNT)-grafted woven

carbon fibers were used to make carbon/epoxy composites. By using the three points bending and 
tension tests, some mechanical properties were determined. It was shown that the composites with 
CNT – grafted carbon fiber reinforcements using the chemical vapor deposition have a 11% tensile 
strength increased compared to the ones obtained from the pure chemical method and a 20% 
increase compared to the composites with unmodified carbon fibers. The effects of carbon fiber/ Al 
interface on mechanical properties of carbon-fiber-reinforced aluminum matrix composites were 
studied in [7]. In [8] it is studied the reinforcement effect of carbon fiber on the friction and wear 
properties of carbon fiber reinforced PA6 composites.  
Theoretical background regarding the transversal vibrations 
In the case of small deformations, the transversal vibrations can be determined with Eq. 1 [9].

In the Eq. 1 we have marked with v(x,t) the displacement of the bar section elastic centre, EI the 
bar flexural rigidity, with ρA the product between the density and the transversal area and with C the 
damping factor per unit length. The Eq.1 can be used for Euler-Bernoulli bar types. We have chosen 
in this study the free lengths of 320 and 350 mm and the thickness values of 15 and 10 mm because 
we wanted to apply this theory to determine the bars flexural rigidity and the dynamic Young 
modulus. According to [9] or [10], if the next conditions are applied: q(x,t)=0 and

polypropylene honeycomb core and epoxy resin) but combined in a new way. Two of the bars are 
reinforced with two carbon layers (one in the upper side and another in the lower side) and the other

two are reinforced with four carbon layers (two in the upper side and the other two in the lower 
side). These composite bars have different thickness values (10, 15 mm) and 45 mm width. In order 
to apply the Euler-Bernoulli theory, we have considered two bars free lengths: 320 and 350 mm. A 
general view with the used samples is presented in fig. 1.

Conclusions 
The added value of this paper is building some new composite materials, made from classical 
parts (polypropylene honeycomb core, carbon fiber and epoxy resin) but combined in order to 
obtain a new structure. From the Table 1 analysis we can extract the following conclusions: 
- there were used the 320 and 350 mm values for the free lengths, because the Euler-Bernoulli 
theory was applied; 
- if two extra carbon fiber layers are used, both the stiffness and the dynamic Young modulus 
are increased; 
- if an arithmetic mean is made between the values obtained for 320 and 350 mm, we obtain the 
next results for the flexural rigidity: 7.684 Nm2 (two carbon fiber layers, 10 mm thickness); 21.2545 
Nm2 (two carbon fiber layers, 15 mm thickness); 12.4745 Nm2 (four carbon fiber layers, 10 mm 
thickness); 27.52 Nm2 (four carbon fiber layers, 15 mm thickness); 
- the flexural rigidity increase will be of 62.344% for the samples with 10 mm thickness and 
27.333% for the samples with 15 mm thickness if two extra carbon fiber layers are used;

- if an arithmetic mean is made between the values obtained for 320 and 350 mm, we obtain the 
next results for the dynamic Young modulus: 2068 MPa (two carbon fiber layers, 10 mm thickness); 
1679 MPa (two carbon fiber layers, 15 mm thickness); 3325.5 MPa (four carbon fiber layers, 10 
mm thickness); 2174 MPa (four carbon fiber layers, 15 mm thickness); 
- the dynamic Young modulus increase will be of 60.808% for the samples with 10 mm 
thickness and 29.482% for the samples with 15 mm thickness if two extra carbon fiber layers are 
used;

Abstract. In machining operation, the quality of surface finish is an important requirement for 
many turned work pieces. Cutting temperature is one of the most important parameters in 
determining the cutting performance and tool life. The objective for this work  is to estimate the 
cutting temperature in 3D model on tool-chip interface and the interface temperature during turning 
process, using the digital simulation software COMSOL Multiphysics.The tool–chip interface 
temperature results obtained from experimental results by using C45 medium carbon steel work 
piece with natural contact tools, without the application of cooling and lubricating agents and a K 
type thermocouple technique  was used for estimating cutting temperatures in a turning operation.  
This procedure facilitates the determination of the temperature at tool-chip interface in dry turning 
process, which is still a challenge for existing experimental and numerical methods. 
Introduction  
    Due to the high cost involved in obtaining machining data experimentally, there are strong 
motivations for development of methodologies for description of different machinability 
phenomena using a numerical approach [1]. Cutting is one of the most important and common 
manufacturing processes in industry. Machining is not an easy process to study and to model, due to 
the inherent difficulty to know exactly what happens in the region around the tool tip [2]. 
    Thermal consideration of hard machining processes is very important for tool wear mechanisms 
and heat penetration into the subsurface layer, which leads to the formation of the white layer and 
determines the distribution of residual stresses [3]. However, there is plenty of evidence in literature 
that machining processes generate an important heat and the temperature has a great influence on 
cutting tool wear since it modifies the thermal, mechanical, thermomechanical and metallurgical 
properties [1,5]. 
    Many problems are still remaining unsolved. One of these problems deals with heat transfer at 
tool contact interfaces. Various experimental techniques (thermocouple, infrared system, etc.) have 
been developed and used to evaluate the cutting temperature during machining operations [5]. The 
determination of the maximum temperature and temperature distribution along the rake face of the 
cutting tool is of particular importance due to its controlled influence on tool life [2]. 
    Simulation of the actual metal cutting and chip formation process is very time consuming, even 
with modern software packages and computers [1]. Finally, it is possible to simulate chip formation, 
and determine approximate machining forces in a cutting operation with 2D or 3D models [6]. 
    The present study is made to predict tool temperature distribution numerically using 3D Finite 
Element (FE) methods in a turning operation. The results obtained  from these simulations are used  
to perform unsteady state heat transfer analysis using COMSOL Multiphysics. 
 In this work, tool temperature distributions has been measured using thermocouple, the 
temperatures obtained by computer simulation are compared with the temperatures obtained by the

experimental measurements, these comparisons showed good agreement between the different 
results. 
Experimental set-up 
    Thermocouples are known to be very popular transducers for measuring temperature. The tool 
work thermocouple technique is a widely used technique [7,9,10]. The k-type thermocouple was 
chosen for measuring the temperature in this work. This technique was preferred as it is 
inexpensive, easy to calibrate, has a quick response time and good repeatability during experiments. 
A mineral insulated, metal sheathed, k-type thermocouple with Digital micro voltmeter of ranges 
between 200°C and 1200°C. The cutting conditions are rotation speeds (N is vary from  440 to 2500 
Tr/min, feeds rate (f) from 0.045 to 0.225 mm/rev, and depth of cuts (a) from 0.25 to 1.5 mm. 
Tungsten carbide uncoated inserts were used for the turning tests, these inserts are manufactured by 
Sandvik. Uncoated carbide inserts as per ISO specification P25. The parameter levels were chosen 
within the intervals based on the recommendations by the cutting tool manufacturer. Universal 
turning machine tool was used in the experiments. All tests were performed dry. 
 Work Material. The work material used as the test specimen was  C45 medium carbon steel A 
cylindrical bar of (300 mm long 60 mm diameter) commonly used in industry aerospace,

 Measurement of tool temperature distributions. The accuracy of measured temperature depends   
on several parameters such as the experimental set up, physical acquisition data system and physical 
characteristic of the tool [4]. 
The positions of the thermocouples are shown in Figure.1. The thermocouples were attached using 
capacitive discharge welding at the insert (TC1, TC2 and TC3). All test specimens were 
manufactured in carbon steel a cylindrical bar with the same characteristics and mechanical 
properties. The temperatures (TC1, TC2 and TC3) are directly recorded during the machining test 
with a data acquisition system controlled by a microcomputer with specific software (PHYWE 
Cobra3) to acquire signals from the K type thermocouples. The typical set-up used for the 
temperature measurements is shown in Figure 1. Cutting condition which was taken for analysis 
and numerical validation is as follows:  
 - Rotation speeds: N = 440 and 2500 rev/min. 
 - Feed rate: f = 0.045 mm/ rev. 
 - Depth of cut: ap = 0.5 and 1.5 mm. 
The measured temperature  data were analysed  and the results were used as input data in the FEM 
simulation.

Finite element model and simulation 
    Finite element method has been widely used to investigate quantities difficult to measure in the 
cutting process [8]. The thermal expansions of the tool and the workpiece can be calculated prior to 
actual turning using finite element (FE) models in order to adapt the nominal depth of cut 
accordingly [11]. 
    The tool temperature distribution when machining with the orthogonal cutting geometry of 
Figure.1 is simulated using the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics 3D figure.2. The 
numerically determined temperatures are afterwards compared with the experimentally measured 
temperatures.

The 3-D thermal  model. A FEM is widely used, since it allows treating the problem in 3D case 
with fewer simplifying assumptions, unlike analytical approaches [12]. In simulation, the 
temperature fields in the WP, the tool and the chip can be calculated over the whole period of time 
[13]. A fully 3D thermal modeling of the heat transfer into the insert at cutting time equal 60 s is 
shown in Figure.4.

    Figure 3 A, B shows the evolution of temperature versus time for the three positions (TC1 , TC2

cyan ) and finally the cooler (blue). 
    Figure 4 A, B shows the simulated cutting temperature distribution in turning process at a spindle 
speed of 440 rev/min and 2500 rev/min. Can be seen from this figures, the maximum value of 
cutting temperature lies in tool-chip interface and is higher than the temperature in shear 
deformation zone. 
Figures 3 and 5 (A and B) shows a comparison between finite element simulation curve and 
experimental curve of cutting temperature. As can be seen from these two figures, there is an 
agreement between FEM simulation and the experimental curve , we can see  too that the results of 
the finite element simulation and experimental results are consistent, showing its accuracy and the 
feasibility of the simulation with FEM. 
 
Conclusions 
    An attempt is made to predict unsteady state tool temperature distribution using 3D orthogonal 
metal turning simulations in COMSOL Multiphysics. The results from these simulations are used to 
perform unsteady state heat transfer analysis. To validate finite element simulation result of turning 
process, the cutting temperature experiment was carried out with the same cutting conditions as that 
used in finite element simulation. Tool temperature distributions are measured using the 
Thermocouple technique. The following conclusions can be drawn: 
- We can see that the experimental results are not far apart and are even looking to the results of 
numerical simulations with COMSOL Multiphysics. 
- By comparing the results obtained from finite element simulation and cutting temperature 
experiment results, a good agreement is found, showing finite element simulation analysis of 
cutting temperature for C 45 steel. 
- Modeling and numerical simulation can provide a fast, economical and very effective to reproduce 
the cutting phenomena and estimate the quantities characterizing the thermomechanical processing 
of materials (temperature, efforts , stress, strain, etc ... ).

Keywords: electrochemical honing, processing time, electrolyte, SS-316, surface finishing, out-of-
roundness  
Abstract. Electrochemical Honing (ECH) is a process of precision finishing of functional surfaces 
with the use of the electrical and mechanical energy. It is reported that the 90 percent of the material 
is removed by electrochemical machining (ECM) process and remaining 10 percent by mechanical 
scrubbing, which shows the electrical energy is the main constituent in the ECH process. Basically, 
electrical energy is combined with chemical to form an electrolysis dissolution to remove material 
from the workpiece surface. This work presents a study for the factors affecting the electrochemical 
honing of SS-316 turned surfaces, especially the processing time and electrolyte composition. The 
percentage improvement in surface roughness (Ra, Rt) and out-of-roundness (OOR) as a monitored 
output of ECH were determined. The results are finally furnished with the aim to generalize a useful 
guideline for the user to enable proper selection of conditions for obtaining good surface quality. 
Introduction 
Electrochemical honing (ECH) is largely operated on the principle of electrolysis and can be 
thought of as highly accelerated and controlled corrosion. The main advantages of this process are 
the complex 3D geometries can be finished with a single setting, high rates of finishing which are 
virtually independent of material hardness, remove material without heat, and precise surface finish 
because material is removed at an atomic level [1]. In today's high precision and time sensitive 
scenario, ECH has wide scope for applications. More specifically, ECH is a process based on the 
controlled anodic dissolution of the workpiece anode, with the tool as the cathode, in an electrolytic 
solution. The electrolyte flows between the electrodes and carries away the dissolved metal [2].  
Since the first introduction of ECH in 1967 by Randlett and Ellis, its applications have been 
increasingly recognized for its potential for finishing, while the precision of the finished profile is a 
concern of its application. During the ECH process, electrical current passes through an electrolyte 
solution between a cathode tool and an anode workpiece. The workpiece is eroded in accordance 
with Faraday's law of electrolysis [3]. ECH processes find wide applicability in areas such as 
aerospace, automobile, gear manufacturing, nuclear reactor applications etc. Furthermore, it has 
been reported that the accuracy of finishing can be improved by the use of pulsed electrical current 
and controlling various process parameters [4]. Amongst the often considered parameters are 
electrolyte concentration, voltage, current and inter-electrode gap (IEG). Though there is a 
possibility of improving the precision of work, the dependency of accuracy on numerous parameters 
demand that a thorough investigation should be carried out to ascertain the causality to different 
parameters [5, 6]. From the available literature it can concluded that no work has been reported on 
the ECH of SS-316 turned surfaces. The aim of the present work is focused on the key factors, such 
as processing time and electrolyte composition) affecting the ECH of SS-316 turned shafts to 
achieve a better surface roughness and geometrical accuracy.

The Process Principle of ECH 
The process principle of ECH is based on the Faraday's laws of electrolysis and mechanical 
scrubbing. Figure 1 describes the proposed working principle of ECH process of recovered surfaces 
of cylindrical shafts. In this process, most of the metal is removed at the atomic scale by anodic 
dissolution. Moreover, the honing action as well acts as performance multiplier.  
 
 
Fig. 1 A schematic of the proposed working principle of ECH of recovered surfaces of shafts 
 
The workpiece is made as an anode and the tool is made as a cathode by applying a small DC 
electric potential across them. The IEG is filled with the full streams of electrolyte and a DC current 
is passed through the gaps. During the process, material removal from the workpiece and same time 
oxygen is evolved out at the cathode after dissolution of aqua solution and this oxygen reacts with 
anodic workpiece to form a thin metal oxide micro-film on workpiece. This micro-film is insulating 
in nature and protects the workpiece surface from being further removed and it minimizes the ECM 
action. This oxide layer on the surface of the workpiece is scraped by the honing action, when it 
comes in contact with honing tool. The honing tool was spring loaded and help to complete 
scrubbing of the workpiece surface. This scrubbed surface, when returning to the ECM zone, is 
removed electrochemically once again. As the process carries on, the geometric accuracy of the 
workpiece is rapidly improved. 
Experimental Details 
Figure 2 depicts a photographic view of the developed experimental setup of ECH of recovered 
surfaces of the shafts. This setup has four subsystems, namely (i) power supply system; (ii) 
electrolyte supply and recirculation system; (iii) finishing chamber housing workpiece, cathode and 
honing tools; and (iv) rotation system to the tooling system. In ECH process, most of the material is 
removed due to electrolytic dissolution during ECM action. Generally, copper is used as cathode; 
iron is used as anode and mixture of NaCl and NaNO3 aqua solution in different ratio is used as an 
electrolyte. The other input process parameters are fixed based on the literature review and the 
machine constraints as described in Table 1. The workpiece surface made of SS-316 is deposited on 
the shafts using twin wire arc spray process. The chemical composition of deposoited layer is 
presented in Table 2 using spark spectrometer test. The recovered surfaces are first machined using 
an appropriate conventional machining method and their process parameters, which will help to 
attain a regular geometry close to the designed dimensions. The prepared workpiece before and 
after recovery (before ECH) is described in Fig. 3.

Roughness parameters (Ra, Rt) were evaluated before and after the process, is measured by a 
Wyko NT 1100 optical profilometer interfaced with Vision®32 software. The average surface 
roughness (Ra) and maximum surface roughness (Rt) values of the recovered cylindrical shafts are 
collected before and after the process. The  percentage improvement in average surface roughness 
(PIRa) and percentage improvement in maximum surface roughness (PIRt) is calculated using the 
equation 1 and equation 2 respectively. Higher values of PIRa/PIRt indicate the smaller value of 
final Ra/Rt. The percentage improvement in the out-of-roundness (PIOOR) is calculated using the 
equation 3.

Results and discussion 
Table 3 presents the values of variable input parameters and corresponding values of the three 
responses for an optimum processing time. The electrolyte composition is fixed at their middle level 
(see the Table 4). It is observed from these results that the best combination of responses was 
achieved for experiment run 3, because after that rate of improvement is almost constant in case of 
PIRa and PIRt. It yields that the OOR for the other experiment run is higher than the experiments 
no. 3, but slightly. Therefore, processing time of 90 seconds is found the most appropriate for 
investigating the electrolyte composition.

To study the mixture of NaCl and NaNO3 percentage in electrolyte, mixture D-optimal design is 
selected for experimentation. As per design of experiment, nine experiments are conducted.  The 
percentage by weight of NaCl is varied from 60 to 90% and of NaNO3 from 10 to 40%. The 
statistical software used is “Design-Expert 6.0.8”. The experimental runs are considered as a single 
block. The values of variable input parameters and corresponding values of the three responses for 
all 9 experiment runs is illustrated in Table 4. Table 5 presents the results of ANOVA for 
percentage improvement in average roughness, maximum roughness, and out-of-roundness. The p-
value for the models was found to be less than 0.05 indicating that the developed models are 
statistically significant at 95% confidence level, which is desirable because it exhibits that the terms 
in the model have a significant impact on the responses.

It is observed from Fig. 4 that the surface roughness and geometrical accuracy, improve with the 
addition of NaNO3 in the NaCl solution initially, but the average roughness certainly fall with the 
increasing content of NaNO3 beyond to 18 percent. The improvement in the out-of-roundness is 
remain increasing with the increases content of NaNO3 up to 30 percent. Through the results 
analysis, it is justified that the identified optimum parametric combination is 78.69:21.31 for 
NaCl:NaNO3 electrolyte, for precision finishing of SS-316 shafts using ECH process. Fig. 5 (a-b)

the shafts finished by the ECH appears glazed indicating significant improvement in surface finish.

Conclusion 
In the present work, the experimental studies of the ECH process on the SS-316 shafts were carried 
out for better understanding of the process key factors. Results have been presented with suitable 
illustrations. The study reveals that the ECH is one of the best ideal choice for finishing of 
recovered surfaces. In ECH process, scratch and feed marks on the workpiece surfaces are 
effectively removed and the nano-level finished can be achieved at the optimum process 
parameters; processing time 90 seconds and 78.5:21.5 combination of NaCl:NaNO3 electrolyte. The 
improvement in the surface quality is rapid during the initial phases of finishing. The surface 
topography gets significantly improved resulting in glazed texture and higher geometrical accuracy.

Abstract. Chatter, geometric lobbing and work piece rotation problems are the main problems 
which affect the centerless grinding productivity. An original method was developed and 
implemented to determine the displacement of the center of the piece in centerless grinding. Until 
now no functional tool has been developed to solve these coupled problems. In conclusion, future 
trends and research work in centerless grinding technology are analyzed and discussed.  
Introduction 
The improvement of grinding accuracy and productivity for the past century is remarkable and 
the centerless grinding process has become a standard method applied to various fields of industry, 
especially automotive and bearings. The centerless grinding method provides high precision and 
high efficiency in production, because of the uniqueness of the work piece support system and the 
drive mechanism for workpiece rotation. However, the method is very sensitive to setup conditions 
[1]. Centerless grinding is commonly employed for the mass production of rotationally symmetrical 
components, particularly in automotive industry. The ability to manufacture components that are 
capable of meeting the wide range of quality, availability and cost requirements depends on various 
input parameters [2]. Due to tendencies towards a decrease in batch sizes, end users direct research 
initiatives towards flexible, small, or even single batch centerless grinding. On the shop floor, where 
different workpiece geometries are ground with the same machine tool, the set-up adjustments, 
usually based on trial and error, may lead to significant machine tool downtime and process 
inefficiency [3].

As shown in Fig. 1, various types of grinding can be performed, such as cylindrical grinding of 
the outer surface of a cylindrical work piece, internal grinding of the inner surface of a cylinder, 
surface grinding of a flat face, and centerless grinding of work piece without using a chuck to hold 
the work piece [4]. The process suffers from three kinds of instabilities that may limit its precision 
and productivity. 
1) Chatter, who’s growing is much more pronounced than in conventional grinding. 
2) Geometric lobbing, which appears when the work piece does not self-centre and begins to 
oscillate between the wheels. 
3) Work-holding instability, which appears when the regulating wheel is not able to make the 
work piece spin at its peripheral velocity [5]. 
During the centerless grinding process with transversely advance, are manifesting the 
phenomenon of apparition of certain deviations from circularity and modification of the central axis 
position due to the instabilities static regenerative of parts subjected to processing and due to the 
particularities of deployment. 
Calculation of displacement of the center parts in the centerless grinding process with 
transversely advance 
In technological process of centerless grinding with transversely advance happens that some parts 
from the previous processing to have deviations from circularity in a place A of value ∆R (Fig. 2). 
 
 
Fig. 2 The displacement of the center of the piece 
 
This deviation makes the side surface of the piece, after centerless grinding to result a polygonal 
[8] but which may permanently regenerate at every rotation of the work piece, these becoming 
cylindrical but with another central axis that passes through the point O1, relative to the original axis 
that passes through the point O. Outer diameter of work piece is D, and the interior d before 
grinding. After centerless grinding process outside diameter become Df, and the interior remain 
unchanged d.  
It is considered the piece 1 from the Fig.3 a represented with dotted line leaning on the abrasive 
disc 2, on advance disc and adjustment 3 and on the adjustment support 4, showing the deviation A 
of the outside points of support. 
During rotation of the piece 1, deviation ∆R touches tangent at disc 3 of adjustment and advance, 
as a result the center O moves to O1 and the abrasive disc 2 rectifies more than the transversal 
advance established for the cylindrical piece, causing ∆ r' deviation. 
In the right-angled triangle OO'O1 may write that the displacement of the center is:

(O1) as a point of intersection of the axes of coordinates o1z1y1, it appears that the center (O1) of 
piece moves towards the initially center (O), with sizes U1 and V1.

Conclusion 
The maximum deviation ∆R regenerates due to the combined action of deviations ∆r' and ∆r'' 
corresponding. 
Deviation ∆R is influenced primarily by the number of sides of the curvilinear polygon. This 
depends on the values of angles β and θ, which in turn can be adjusted via h dimension. In this case, 
however the negative influences of the change in technological parameters specific to processing 
through centerless grinding with transversely advance are not eliminated. In the case of processing 
on the machine for centerless grinding with transversal advance made by the author, in order to 
avoid the occurrence of curvilinear polygonality and for decrease the negative effects in this case 
due to variation of technological parameters of process (working force, variable solicitation of 
elastic technological system, vibration, uncontrolled wear of the abrasive disc and others), has been 
adopted the variant of introduction of automatic control of regime parameters (called adaptive 
control of machine tools) through the control of transversal advance force and maintaining them 
constant. Following the analysis of the experimental results, it was found, in the case of automated 
management of processing, a sharp decline in the phenomenon of poligonality and an increase in the 
processing accuracy until the extinction almost in totality of this negative phenomenon.

Abstract. In this paper, a new, optimization strategy is used for the determination of the optimum 
cutting parameters for multipass milling operations. This strategy is based on the “minimum 
production time” criterion. The optimum number of passes is determined via dynamic 
programming, and the optimal values of the cutting conditions are found based on the objective 
function developed for the typified criterion by using a hybrid genetic algorithm with SQP. GA is 
the main optimizer of this algorithm, whereas SQP is used to fine-tune the results obtained from the 
GA. Furthermore, the convergence characteristics and robustness of the proposed method have been 
explored through comparisons with results reported in literature. The obtained results indicate that 
the proposed strategy is effective compared to other techniques carried out by different researchers. 
Introduction  
The interest of the optimization of cutting conditions lies in the improvement of certain 
machining parameters, said optimization criteria (production time, productivity, surface state, etc..), 
Taking into account the limitations of performance of the machine, the cutting tool and the 
machined material. These limits are taken from the laws of cutting and expressed in terms of cutting 
conditions (cutting speed, feed per tooth and depth of cut). They are called optimization constraints 
and they limit the Research domain under optimal conditions. 
Multi-pass operations are generally used to machine stocks that cannot be removed in a single 
pass. Some turning operations like external step turning and boring, and some of the milling 
operations, such as face milling and deep shoulder milling in which a significant amount of stock 
material is removed, are good examples of the operations which are commonly required to be 
machined using multi-pass operations [1]. 
In an earlier work, analysis of multi-pass operations has been done using a variety of 
optimization criteria [2, 3, 4, 5 and 6]. Iwata et al. [7] proposed an optimization model based on 
dynamic programming to solve the problem of the optimization of multi-pass machining operations. 
Agapiou [8] has developed a multi-pass optimization system for turning based on dynamic 
programming technique and then the cutting conditions are optimized through the Nelder–Mead 
Simplex method. 
Currently, two approaches are used to solve the optimization of multi-pass machining problem: 
Using computer-aided mathematical programming techniques,  
Using numerical optimization techniques. 
Recently, Sonmez et al [1] have used an algorithm adopted from the study of Agapiou [8]. 
However, the methodology used in his work is rather different because the geometric programming 
is used in place of the Nelder–Mead Simplex method in the optimization of each stage of the 
dynamic programming. Venkata Rao et al [9] has used the analysis given by Sonmez et al [1]. 
However, the optimization is carried out with three non-traditional optimization algorithms namely, 
artificial bee colony, particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing.

The strategy used in this study is adopted from the study of Sonmez et al and Agapiou [1, 8] 
which is proposed for the multi-pass machining operations. However, the methodology used in this 
work is based on using of a new optimization technique, the hybrid genetic algorithm - sequential 
quadratic programming, for optimization of each stage of the dynamic programming. 
Cutting process model 
The optimization model formulated in the present work is based on the analysis given by 
Sonmez et al. [1].

considered: cutting speeds (m/min)

Constraints. Some constraints that affect the selection of optimal cutting conditions will be 
considered. The constraints are as outlined below: 
Parameter bounds. Due to the limitations on the machine and cutting tool and due to the safety of 
machining, the cutting parameters are limited with the bottom and top limit. 
Cutting power. The power required for the cutting operation must not exceed the power of the 
machine tool:

Optimization methodology 
The optimal value of the number of passes, the speed, feed and depth of cut for each pass is 
obtained by the multi-pass process. It is a problem with four variables. Where the number of passes, 
and the depth of cut for each pass are determined using dynamic programming procedure. Cutting 
speed and feed rate for each pass are determined using the hybrid GA - SQP.  
The concept of dynamic programming is very useful for the treatment of multi-pass problem, in 
which each pass is independent of previous passes, as in the case of milling operations. 
The decision variable in the dynamic programming (in the optimization problem) is the depth of 
cut 
ia to be taken in the it pass, which is represented as
(
)
,
a i j . Total depth of cut 
Ta is divided into 
N equal sections which are actually the N discrete decision states. The minimum increment of depth 
of cut is equal to [1]: 
Ta

N

It is defined arbitrarily and should always smaller than the maximum depth of cut allowed for a 
machine tool workpiece system
max
a
. The optimum number of passes Np is determined by the 
dynamic programming approach and a pass consists of a certain number of sections a. 
To solve the optimization of multipass milling problem it is necessary take the following steps:

Results 
The cutting conditions are optimized through the hybrid genetic algorithm - sequential quadratic 
programming. Several GA generations are performed in order to identify the most promising areas 
and then the SQP optimization algorithm is applied using, as an initial guess, the best individual 
found by the GA. It should be noted that in this approach the GA is used to specify a good initial 
guess for the SQP algorithm. 
The developed optimization strategy utilizes two techniques: dynamic programming and hybrid 
genetic algorithm. For automating the steps of dynamic programming, a program is implemented in 
MATLAB language while the hybrid genetic algorithm was done using MATLAB toolboxes.

Now we solve the problem by dynamic programming 
Step 1: N=3 
First we divided the total depth of cut in 3 equal sections. The results obtained after execution of 
the program are presented in the table below

Discussion and conclusion 
The influence of number of sections N used by the dynamic programming technique is observed 
by comparing the results of the previous tables for N = 3, 5 and 8. 
Increasing the number of sections from 3 to 8, the result is an increase in the production time. 
Finally we note that the optimal number of passes and the corresponding machining conditions 
in accordance with all limitations constraints for a total depth of cut equal to 5 mm is obtained with 
the number of sections N = 3. 
This paper presents a new strategy optimization for solving the multi-pass milling operations 
problem. The results obtained from comparing this strategy with those taken from [1] prove its 
effectiveness(
