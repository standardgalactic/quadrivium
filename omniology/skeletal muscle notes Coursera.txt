1. Introduction and contraction 
Muscle Types 
There are three types of muscle in the human body: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth. Each 
muscle cell is called a fiber. The three fiber types differ in structure and function within 
the body.  
 
A Skeletal muscle fiber is a large (10-100 m diameter), multinucleated syncytium. 
Those fibers attached to bone, mediate voluntary movement of the skeleton, and/or 
maintain body position and posture. Others such as the extra-ocular muscle of the eye 
and the tongue are not attached to the skeleton but provide precise voluntary 
movements. Skeletal muscle contraction is controlled by the somatic nervous system.  
 
Cardiac muscle fibers are small (10-15 m in diameter) cells with one (or two) nuclei 
that are connected to each other by gap junctions. These cells form a functional 
coordinated unit found in the walls of the heart and at the base of the large veins that 
empty into the heart. Cardiac muscle is regulated by the autonomic (parasympathetic 
and sympathetic) nervous system. 
 
Smooth muscle cells are small (2-15 m in diameter) cells found as bundles or sheets 
in the walls of blood vessels, the GI tract, and uterus. Where smooth muscle cells are 
connected by gap junctions, the bundle or sheet acts as a single coordinated unit.  
Smooth muscle is regulated by the autonomic nervous system.  
 
All three types of muscle contain the contractile proteins, myosin and actin, contract to 
generate force, and share 3 common principles: 
1. Sliding filament mechanism in which myosin filaments bind to and pull actin 
filaments as a basis for shortening. 
2. Regulation of contractile proteins by calcium ions. 
3. Changes in membrane potential lead to a rise in intracellular calcium resulting in 
contraction (E-C coupling).  
 
Skeletal Muscle Structure 
During early development of skeletal muscle, undifferentiated myoblasts fuse to form a 
single multinucleated cylinder or fiber. Differentiation is completed by birth after which 
the muscle fibers increase in size but not number. Adult muscle fibers can vary in length 
from a few millimeters to almost a meter.

In the body, connective tissue 
surrounds each muscle fiber, 
each bundle of muscle fibers 
(called a fascicle), and several 
fascicles to form a muscle. The 
connective tissue wrapping is 
essential to force transduction. At 
the end of the muscle, the 
connective tissue continues as a 
tendon which usually attaches the 
muscle to bone.  
 
Skeletal muscle often overlaps a 
joint in the limb thereby allowing 
for lever action. In this 
arrangement a small degree of 
muscle cell shortening produces a 
large movement of the limb. The 
limb muscles are arranged in 
pairs such that muscles on 
opposite sides of the limb act in 
opposition. For example, flexors 
contract to close the angle at the 
joint and extensors contract to 
open the angle at the joint.    
 
Each muscle fiber (single cell) is 
filled with longitudinally arranged 
myofibrils whose number 
determines the force generating 
capacity of the muscle fiber (Fig. 
1). Each myofibril extends the 
length of the muscle fiber. 
Myofibrils are composed of 
myofilaments which are 
polymers of the contractile 
proteins, actin and myosin (Fig. 
1). Actin is called the thin 
filament; myosin the thick 
filament.  
 
Thick and thin filaments are organized into a series of repeating functional units called 
sarcomeres which give the striated appearance in the phase contrast microscope of 
skeletal (and cardiac) muscle. The striations are made of dark and light bands (Fig. 2), 
which are called A and I bands, respectively. Places where there is only actin are the I 
bands and anywhere there is myosin are the A bands.

Thin filaments are anchored to a dense line called the Z line which bisects the I bands. 
The sarcomere extends from one Z line to the next Z line (Fig. 2).  
 
Thick filaments comprise the A band. These are polarized filaments in which the myosin 
tail region is anchored to the M line in the center of the sarcomere and the globular 
region (myosin head) extends away from the M line towards the Z lines. There are no 
myosin heads and no overlap with actin in the area immediately adjacent to the M line. 
This is called the H zone (Fig. 2).  
 
The space between the thick and thin filaments contains the myosin heads. They are 
called cross bridges because they extend from the parallel axis of the thick filaments 
towards the thin filaments. During muscle contraction, these cross bridges make contact 
with the thin filaments (actin) and exert force on them. 
 
Molecular 
Mechanisms of 
Contraction 
 
Contraction is the activation 
of the force generating sites 
(cross bridges = myosin 
heads) within the muscle 
fibers and does not 
necessarily mean shortening. 
(For example, the muscle will 
contract as you hold a tray of 
glasses but does not 
shorten.) The force 
generated is called tension.  
 
Relaxation is the cessation 
of force generating activity 
and a decline in tension.  
 
Sliding filament mechanism of contraction states that the skeletal muscle fiber 
shortens when the overlapping thick filaments and thin filaments slide past one another, 
causing the Z lines of each sarcomere to move towards the M line (Fig. 2). There is no 
change in the length of either the thick or thin filaments. Which band - A, I or H also 
shortens?  
 
Movement of the thin filaments toward the M line is powered by the myosin ATPase 
located in the myosin head (cross bridge). During shortening, the myosin cross bridges 
attach to the thin filament (actin), undergo a conformational change (power stroke) 
which pulls the actin filament toward the M line similar to the rowing action of oars 
moving through water (Fig. 3).

Energy (ATP) is needed to break a cross bridge, i.e., release the myosin head from its 
contact with actin. In the absence of ATP, cross bridges remain attached to actin in a 
state called rigor (Fig. 3).  
 
Regulation of contraction involves Ca++. In skeletal muscle, regulation of contraction 
occurs on the thin filament by a complex of two proteins, tropomyosin and troponin. 
Tropomyosin lies along actin, blocking the myosin binding site. Troponin is anchored to 
tropomyosin and the binding of Ca++ to troponin causes tropomyosin to shift thereby 
exposing the myosin binding site on actin. Contraction will continue in the presence of 
Ca++ and ATP.  Relaxation occurs when Ca++ is removed.  
 
In skeletal muscle, Ca++ is 
stored within the cell in a 
membrane bound compartment 
called the sarcoplasmic 
reticulum (SR). The SR wraps 
around myofibrils. Ca++ is 
released from the SR into the 
cytoplasm in response to an 
electrical signal (action potential). 
The action potential opens a 
voltage gated channel in the T 
tubule (invagination of the 
plasma membrane) which is 
adjacent to the SR (Fig. 4). This 
voltage gated channel is called 
the dihydropyridine receptor. 
Activation of the dihydropyridine 
receptor in turn opens a Ca++ 
channel (ryanodine receptor) on 
the SR and Ca++ enters the 
cytoplasm (Fig. 4). Ca++ is taken 
back up into the SR from the cytoplasm by the SR CaATPase.   
 
Transverse tubule system or T tubules are invaginations of the sarcolemma located 
between the SR terminals. The T tubule membrane contains the voltage gated Ca++ 
channels (dihydropyridine receptors) which open with depolarization of the membrane 
(Fig. 4).  
 
E-C coupling (excitation-contraction coupling) Figure 4 refers to the electrical 
events which trigger a contraction. Each skeletal muscle is innervated by an alpha 
motor neuron. An action potential arriving at the neuromuscular junction releases the 
neurotransmitter acetylcholine from the presynaptic site. Acetylcholine transverses the 
synaptic cleft and binds to nicotinic receptors on the post synaptic muscle. These ligand 
(acetylcholine) gated Na+ channels open resulting in a graded potential (EPSP) 
sufficiently large to depolarize the sarcolemma to threshold. The voltage gated Na+

channels open and trigger an action potential. As this action potential moves along the 
muscle plasma membrane (sarcolemma), it sweeps down the T tubules, opens the 
dihydropyridine receptors and thereby triggers Ca++ release from the SR (Fig. 4). 
Contraction ensues. During contraction the SR CaATPase removes Ca++ from the 
cytoplasm (Fig. 4). This Ca ATPase will restore cytosolic Ca++ levels in less than 30 
msec after the nerve impulses stop.   
 
2. Tension and metabolism 
Muscle Tension  
The mechanical response of a single muscle fiber to a single action potential is called a 
twitch.  
 
Following an action potential there is brief period before tension, the force exerted on 
an object, develops. This is known as the latent period. The action potential of a single 
impulse lasts only 2 milliseconds.  The associated contraction time (twitch) lasts for 10-
100 milliseconds. This means that repeated stimulation of a skeletal muscle will cause 
summation of the contractions until there is no relaxation and fused tetanus is reached 
(Fig 5).  Not all muscle fibers have the same contraction times. Some fast fibers 
contract in 10 milliseconds; slower fibers take 100 milliseconds or longer. The duration 
depends on the SR-ATPase activity.  
 
Tension & Load. The 
tension generated varies 
with load. In order for a 
muscle to shorten and 
thereby move a load, 
muscle tension must 
exceed the opposing load. 
Maximal velocity of 
shortening occurs with no 
opposing load. In isotonic 
contractions, the muscle 
shortens and moves the 
load. Higher loads 
lengthen the latent period, 
slow the velocity of shortening, shorten the duration of contraction, and shorten the 
distance moved.  In isometric contractions, the muscle develops tension but does not 
shorten (or lengthen) because the opposing load equals or exceeds the force 
generation of the muscle.

Length-Tension Relationship. The 
maximal amount of force (tension) a 
muscle can generate is determined 
by the degree of overlap of the thick 
and thin filaments (Fig. 6). The 
basal state and slightly stretched 
state provide optimal force 
generation (Fig. 6). Because the 
muscle is anchored to bone within 
the body, conditions of excess 
stretch or non-overlap and excess 
contraction are avoided. However, 
with injury, irreversible damage to 
the actin and myosin filaments can 
occur.   
 
 
 
Skeletal Muscle Metabolism 
Muscle fibers depend on ATP to produce force. There are three pathways a muscle 
fiber uses to make ATP. Creatine phosphate converts ADP to ATP in a single, fast 
reaction. As a result, 4 moles of ATP are produced per minute from creatine phosphate. 
However, the stores of creatine phosphate are limited so they are used up in the first 10 
seconds of intense exercise. Creatine phosphate is the primary source of ATP during a 
short, high intensity activity such as the 100 meter dash. Anaerobic metabolism burns 
glucose as well as the large stores of muscle glycogen (a glucose polymer) to produce 
lactic acid and ATP in the absence of oxygen. Since only glycolysis is used, 2.5 moles 
of ATP can be produced per minute. Anaerobic metabolism is used during the first 1.5 
minutes of high intensity activity and is the primary source of ATP for the 400 meter 
dash. Aerobic metabolism uses glycogen, blood glucose, or fatty acids to produce 
ATP, CO2, and water in the presence of oxygen. Only 1 mole of ATP is made per 
minute but the available fuel sources are limited only in extreme circumstances. Aerobic 
metabolism is the primary source of ATP during endurance activities such as a 
marathon. 
 
With repeated stimulation, the tension generated by a muscle fiber decreases. This is 
called fatigue. This is not due to a lack of ATP and is not well understood. Several 
factors have been implicated including: 
a. Buildup of extracellular K+ which leads to a persistent depolarization of the cell.  
b. Buildup of metabolites which affect the activity of proteins such as the SR-
CaATPase.  
c. Buildup of ADP and Pi in the cytoplasm, which inhibits cross bridge detachment 
and slows cross bridge cycling. 
d. Decrease in fuel stores, glycogen, fatty acids and glucose.

Skeletal Muscle Fiber Types 
Skeletal muscle fibers are classified into one of three types distinguished by the speed 
of their myosin ATPase and preferred metabolism:  
1. fast, glycolytic fibers fatigue quickly  
2. fast, oxidative, glycolytic fibers resist fatigue  
3. slow, oxidative fibers resist fatigue  
 
Fast fibers undergo cross-bridge cycling about 4 times faster than slow fibers. Oxidative 
fibers contain lots of mitochondria for aerobic metabolism during tasks that require 
endurance. Glycolytic fibers use only small amounts of oxygen and are larger in 
diameter than oxidative fibers. As a result of their larger diameter, each glycolytic fiber 
can produce more tension than an oxidative fiber. Most skeletal muscles include all 
three fiber types. However, each motor unit contains only a single type of muscle fiber. 
Motor units containing slow, oxidative fibers contain fewer fibers than motor units 
containing fast fibers. 
 
Recruitment is the process of activating different types of muscle fibers within a 
fascicle in response to need. Recruitment starts with slow, oxidative fibers that do not 
provide a lot of force but can provide fine muscle control. If more tension is needed, 
fast-oxidative-glycolytic fibers can be recruited. Finally, fast, glycolytic fibers that fatigue 
rapidly increase tension the most dramatically are recruited.
