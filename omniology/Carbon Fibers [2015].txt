Preface
Recently, carbon-based materials have received much attention for their many
potential applications. The carbon ﬁbers are very strong, stiff, and lightweight,
enabling the carbon materials to deliver improved performance in several appli-
cations such as aerospace, sports, automotive, wind energy, oil and gas,
infrastructure, defense, and semiconductors. However, the use of carbon ﬁbers in
cost-sensitive, high-volume industrial applications is limited because of their rela-
tively high costs. However, its production is expected to increase because of its
widespread use in high-volume industrial applications; therefore, the methods used
for manufacturing carbon ﬁbers and carbon ﬁber-reinforced composites and their
structures and characteristics need to be investigated.
This book contains eight chapters that discuss the manufacturing methods,
surface treatment, composite interfaces, microstructure–property relationships with
underlying fundamental physical and mechanical principles, and applications of
carbon ﬁbers and their composites.
Chapter 1 provides a brief overview of carbons and carbon ﬁbers, including their
origin, history, manufacturing technologies, performance, and global market trends.
Chapter 2 introduces the precursors and manufacturing processes of carbon ﬁbers.
Chapter 3 lists the various matrices for carbon ﬁber composites and focuses on the
thermosetting resins and thermoplastic resins. Chapter 4 reviews the effect of sur-
face treatment on the properties of carbon ﬁber composites. The characteristics of
carbon ﬁbers were measured using XPS, x-ray diffraction (XRD), EA, Raman
spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy
(AFM) are presented in Chap. 5. The selection of manufacturing processes, matrix
type, and molding processes for carbon ﬁber composites are presented in Chap. 6.
v

Chapter 7 describes the recent use of carbon ﬁbers for applications such as
adsorbents, energy storage, molecular sieves, catalysts, carbon ﬁber-reinforced
composites, and carbon/carbon composites. Lastly, Chap. 8 introduces low-cost
techniques for general industries, thin carbon ﬁbers for extreme industries and smart
carbon/carbon composites.

History and Structure of Carbon Fibers
Soo-Jin Park and Seul-Yi Lee
Abstract In this chapter, we will introduce the brief overview of carbon ﬁbers
showing superior performance and comprising expensive materials. Further, the
origin and history, deﬁnition and classiﬁcation, manufacturing technology, and
world market and industry trends in carbon ﬁbers will be presented. Recently,
carbon ﬁbers have attracted attention for their potential use as structural materials in
aerospace, sports, cars, and bridges. Also, carbon ﬁbers have been considered as the
next-generation materials in the aerospace/aviation industry, which has presented a
huge opportunity to the entire supply chain of carbon ﬁbers.
1.1 Introduction
Carbon has a number of distinct molecular or crystalline forms termed as allotropes.
These carbon allotropes have distinct properties, which are derived from their
unique structures. The two most notable allotropes of carbon, each containing an
inﬁnite network, are diamond and graphite. These two solids share the same
chemistry (carbon) but possess different structures and properties. For example,
diamond is the hardest known material, while graphite is extremely soft.
Diamond is the perfect atomic crystal of a giant molecule. It is comprised of sp3
hybridized carbon atoms joined by four strong covalent bonds (each 0.154 nm long)
with complete electron pairs, as typically found in covalent molecules. As shown in
Fig. 1.1, the other four carbon atoms point toward the corners of a regular tetra-
hedron to form a strongly bonded covalent structure. Diamond has three major
crystal forms: cubic (100 plane), dodecahedral (110 plane), and octahedral forms
(111 plane) (Fig. 1.2) [1].
Graphite is a layered structure with hexagonally arranged carbon atoms in a
planar condensed ring system. It has three 0.1415-nm-long strong bonds within the

layer that are sp2 hybridized with one electron capable of taking on a dual role, i.e.,
formation of coplanar and interplanar bondings, as shown in Fig. 1.3. These dis-
tributions are called “π” and “σ” distributions, respectively. The graphite layers are
weakly bonded through van der Waal forces. In 1985, a new true carbon form having
both sp2 and sp3 hybridizations was discovered and was named “fullerenes” [2].
The relationship among the different allotropes of carbon is presented in Fig. 1.4.
In addition, there are ﬁbrous forms of carbon such as pyrolytic graphite [3],
glass-like carbon [4], graphite whiskers [5], vapor-grown carbon ﬁbers (VGCF) and
catalytic chemical vapor-deposited ﬁlaments [6–9], and carbon ﬁbers [10]. Some

other forms of carbon are carbon black, charcoal, coal, coke, and soot [11]. Finally,
the newer forms of carbon are fullerenes [12], carbon nanotubes [13], and graphene
[14] (Figs. 1.5 and 1.6).
1.2 Origin and History of Carbon Fibers
The earliest known commercial use of carbon ﬁbers was in the carbonization of
cotton and bamboo ﬁbers for incandescent lamp ﬁlaments. In 1879, Thomas Alva
Edison, for the ﬁrst time, used carbon ﬁber ﬁlaments (testing materials) in his early
incandescent light bulb experiments, which used electricity to heat a thin strip of
material, called a ﬁlament, until it glowed. Later, carbon ﬁbers were discovered in
1880, and he patented the use of carbon ﬁbers as ﬁlament materials for his electric
lamp [15]. Also, he might have created the ﬁrst commercial carbon ﬁbers. The
carbon ﬁbers that Edison made using the natural bamboo ﬁbers or cotton threads
were ﬁre resistant, making them ideal for his early incandescent ﬁlaments. Cotton
and bamboo mostly consist of cellulose, a natural linear polymer composed of

repeating units of glucose. When heated, the ﬁlament carbonized in the absence of
air in a heated gas furnace and then formed a true carbon copy of the starting
materials with exact sizes or shapes. Meanwhile, the use of carbon ﬁlaments for
electric lamps was relatively short-lived; tungsten wire soon displaced these carbon
ﬁlaments. However, the carbon ﬁlaments were in use on US Navy ships as late as
1960 because they withstood ship vibrations better than tungsten (Fig. 1.7).
The carbon ﬁbers were ﬁrst employed by Edison as a ﬁlament material in the
initial development of the electric light, and that paved the way for the use of more
efﬁcient and durable materials within a few years. In particular, the ﬁbrous nature
turned out to be of great importance for structural developments in the aerospace
and automotive ﬁelds. It was expected that the carbon ﬁbers would substitute glass
ﬁbers in several ﬁelds, including transportation, building construction, marine,
electrical and thermal insulation, and industrial products.
The practical commercial uses of carbon ﬁbers, such as reinforcement, came into
being since the 1960s when it became apparent that the carbon ﬁbers, which
contributed signiﬁcantly to the strength and stiffness of structural products, could be
developed.
The Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) during World War II investigated the
fabricated carbon ﬁbers analogously to manufacture rayon and polyacrylonitrile
(PAN). Two manufacturing processes high-strength and high-modulus carbon
ﬁbers from rayon and PAN precursor ﬁbers were simultaneously developed in 1959
and 1962, respectively. In 1963, the pitch-derived carbon ﬁbers, with high-modulus
properties, were invented. Until now, many precursor materials such as polyesters,
polyamides, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylidene, poly-p-phenylene, and phenolic
resins have been investigated for manufacturing carbon ﬁbers [16–32]. The
invention of carbon ﬁlaments by Edison paved the way for the oriented process,
which was developed nearly a century later to produce the carbon ﬁbers from
synthetic ﬁbers.

1.3 Deﬁnition of Carbon Fibers
Historically, a distinction was made between the ﬁbers, which were heat-treated
over the range 1,000–1,500 °C, called carbon ﬁbers, and those heat-treated above
2,000 °C, called graphite ﬁbers. The proportion of graphite in carbon ﬁbers could
range from 0 to 100 %. When the proportion was above 99 %, the ﬁbers were called
graphite ﬁbers.
Generally, carbon ﬁbers are widely deﬁned as ﬁbers containing at least 92 and
up to 100 wt% carbon. Moreover, carbon ﬁbers are polycrystalline, and usually in
the nongraphitic stage. They possess a two-dimensional long-range order of carbon
atoms in planar hexagonal networks (Fig. 1.8), but without any measurable crys-
tallographic order in the third direction (z-direction) apart from more or less parallel
stacking [33, 34].
On the other hand, a graphite whisker (or carbon whisker) is a single crystal with
the carbon layer rolled up like a scroll. The TEM observations of graphite whiskers
are presented in Fig. 1.9 [35]. Because of the single crystal nature, graphite
whiskers are virtually ﬂaw-free and have exceptionally high strength. However,
the production yield of graphite whiskers is too low to be commercially signiﬁcant
[35, 36].

1.4 Classiﬁcation of Carbon Fibers
The carbon ﬁbers play a crucial role in a variety of specialized applications such as
aerospace, automobiles, chemical industry, general engineering, missiles, nuclear
energy, reinforcement in composite materials, and textiles, owing to their inherent
properties, including high strength and stiffness, dimensional stability, low coefﬁ-
cient of thermal expansion, biological compatibility, and fatigue resistance. In this
chapter, we have classiﬁed the carbon ﬁbers based on their performance, precursors,
and commercial availability. Their unique characteristics have also been described.
1.4.1 Performance
Carbon ﬁbers have been classiﬁed on the basis of the ﬁber structure and degree of
crystallite orientation: ultrahigh-modulus (UHM), high-modulus (HM), intermedi-
ate-modulus (IM), high-tensile-strength (HT), and isotropic carbon ﬁbers. Broadly
speaking, these types have been categorized into three or four groups as listed in
Table 1.1.
The UHM and HM carbon ﬁbers are highly graphitized and characterized by a
high modulus. The UHM carbon ﬁbers are characterized with a modulus greater
than 500 GPa, while the HM carbon ﬁbers are characterized with a modulus greater
than 300 GPa and a strength-to-modulus ratio of less than 1 %.
The IM and HT carbon ﬁbers have high strength and low modulus owing to the
heat treatment at lower temperatures. The IM carbon ﬁbers have a modulus of up to
300 GPa and a strength-to-modulus ratio of >1 × 10−2. The HT carbon ﬁbers are

characterized with strength greater than 3 GPa and a strength-to-modulus ratio lying
between 1.5 and 2 × 10−2.
Finally, the isotropic carbon ﬁbers show a random orientation of the crystallites
and possess a modulus as low as 100 GPa combined with low strength. Their main
advantage is low cost (Fig. 1.10).
1.4.2 Precursor
Carbon ﬁbers are manufactured from synthetic ﬁbers (precursor ﬁbers) through
heating and stretching treatments. The processing of carbon ﬁbers from different
precursors requires different conditions to obtain the satisfactory quality end
products. The essential features are similar. The processing paths for various pre-
cursors are similar at the macrolevel. In addition, the precursor materials of the
carbon ﬁbers are important because the combination of various properties and
behaviors (mechanical, physical, and chemical) on the carbon ﬁbers depends on
strongly on the starting precursor materials [38–42].
Generally, the carbon ﬁbers are synthesized through a controlled pyrolysis of the
stabilized precursor ﬁbers (Fig. 1.11) [43, 51]. The precursor ﬁbers were ﬁrst
stabilized and stretched over the temperature range 200–400 °C in air using an
oxidization process (thermoset treatment), which strongly depended on the natural
chemistry of the precursor. Then, in the carbonization process, the stabilized ﬁbers
were subjected to high temperatures over the range 800–1,600 °C in an oxygen-free
environment to remove noncarbon impurities, including hydrogen, oxygen, nitro-
gen, and other noncarbon elements. Further, the carbonized ﬁbers were graphitized
using a graphitization process involving higher temperatures of up to 3,000 °C,
which stretched the ﬁbers resulting in 50–100 % elongation. The stretching of ﬁbers
ensured a preferred crystalline orientation, which resulted in the desired modulus
being higher than those of carbonized ﬁbers. The properties of the resultant carbon

ﬁbers were relevant to their crystallinity, crystalline distribution, carbon content,
molecular orientation, and the proportion of defects. Finally, the surface treatment
processes and epoxy sizing of carbon ﬁbers, i.e., posttreatment processes, were
performed to enhance their adhesion to the composite matrices [44–50].
It is known that the polyacrylonitrile (PAN), pitch, and rayon are the three most
common precursors for the carbon ﬁbers. A simpliﬁed schematic of the process for
the preparation of precursor and typical carbon ﬁbers is presented in Fig. 1.12. The
process for the manufacturing of PAN-based carbon ﬁbers and pitch-based carbon
ﬁbers are shown in Figs. 1.13 and 1.14, respectively.
Figure 1.15 explains in detail the basic chemistry and physics of different pro-
cesses for fabrication. In case of the PAN ﬁbers, the stretching of the coiled
macromolecule in the direction of the polymer chain was parallel to the ﬁber axis
and the subsequent transformation of the linear molecule into a ladder polymer was
observed. The PAN-based precursor ﬁbers are usually fabricated using the con-
ventional spinning technique such as wet spinning. They must be converted to a
form which is ﬂameproof and stable at the high temperatures involved in carbon-
ization. Consequently, before carbonization, they are stabilized in the case of the
PAN precursor in an oxidizing atmosphere.
In the case of the pitch ﬁbers, the preferred orientation was realized by the
spinning process of the liquid crystals in the pitch (melt spinning and melt blowing
methods) [52–59], which consisted of polyaromatic molecules, in a direction

parallel to that of the ﬁbers [55]. The step in the pitch process, involving the
introduction of the structurally preferable orientation of the planar molecules, has to
be combined with chemical treatment to conserve the resulting carbonaceous defect

structure during all the subsequent heat treatment processes. Since the last
100 years, it is well known in the graphite industry what type of thermally stable
defect structures form by the carbonization of thermosetting polymers. On the other
hand, nonstable defect structures, i.e., well-graphitizing cokes, could be achieved
by the carbonization of carbon–hydrogen compounds in a ﬂuid state. From these
general rules, it is believed that the PAN-based precursor ﬁbers prepared by the
cyclization of PAN polymers must yield either nongraphitizing carbon or carbon
ﬁbers with a thermally stable, defective structure. In contrast, the anisotropic pitch-
based carbon ﬁbers possess the ideal preconditions for good graphitization. This
capability of the anisotropic pitch must be destroyed before carbonization by forced
oxidation and cross-linking reactions.
Meanwhile, the pitch precursors are divided into the isotropic and anisotropic
pitches (mesophase pitch) based on their optical characteristics. On the basis of their
mechanical properties, pitch-based carbon ﬁbers can be further classiﬁed into high-
performance (HP) carbon ﬁbers (HP-carbon ﬁbers) and general-purpose carbon ﬁbers
(GP-carbon ﬁbers). The isotropic pitch forms an isotropic carbon ﬁber, which belongs
to the category of GP-carbon ﬁbers, whereas the anisotropic pitch forms HP-carbon
ﬁbers, wherein the carbon layers are preferentially parallel to the ﬁber axis.
The pitch is usually derived as a by-product from either coal- or petroleum-based
chemistry. The pitch from petroleum is preferred because the coal pitch is difﬁcult
to clean owing to natural inclusions as defect-sensitive particles. In contrast to the
PAN-based precursors, the pitch is a low molecular weight material.
In addition, the synthetic pitch could be produced from the synthetic polymers
such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and naphthalene [56]. Ohtani [57] reported the

molten pyrolysis product of PVC for manufacturing carbon ﬁbers. This method
suggested the possibility of utilizing tar pitches from oil reﬁnery and coal pyrolysis
processes as new precursors for carbon ﬁbers. Today, pitch-based carbon ﬁbers
have been introduced in the market [58].
Wazir and Kakakhel reported that when a petroleum pitch was heated at 420 °C
for 7 h in a nitrogen atmosphere, a carbon ﬁber precursor is formed with a softening
point of 295 °C. The precursor was successfully melt-spun into ﬁbers through a
circular nozzle of a monoﬁlament spinning apparatus. Wazir and Kakakhel [59]
focused on optimizing the operating conditions for melt spinning of the precursor
pitch (Fig. 1.16).
Rayon-based carbon ﬁbers are obtained from the rayon precursor ﬁbers using
chemical pretreatments and carbonization. These are isotropic carbon ﬁbers and can
be transformed into anisotropic carbon ﬁbers with high strength and stiffness by
stretching at temperatures above 2,500 °C. However, as shown in Fig. 1.17, all
glycosidic bonds generate volatile carbon dioxide during pyrolysis. It is difﬁcult to
avoid the fracture of the bimolecular unit of the polymer in the volatile ether
glucosan. Mass loss from the polymer structure at different stages of pyrolysis
causes an enormous amount of shrinkage, resulting in a low carbon yield of <30 %.
Consequently, an extremely porous carbon residue with low density is formed.
Figure 1.18 shows the carbon yields of aromatic polymers such as poly(p-phen-
yleneacethylene) and others, compared to those of rayon, PAN, and pitch [60, 61].

History and Structure of Carbon Fibers

It is well known that there are primarily three types of precursor materials of
commercial signiﬁcance, as previously mentioned, PAN, pitch, and rayon.
Although the worldwide production of carbon ﬁbers has increased rapidly, the
prohibitive cost of carbon ﬁber production and high demand limit the widespread
use of carbon ﬁbers. The overall challenge is the combination of precursor cost,
yield, processing cost, and similar factors.
In addition, carbon ﬁbers have been previously manufactured from lignin.
Lignin-based carbon ﬁbers such as Kayacarbon were ﬁrst developed and made

commercially available by Nippon Kayaku Co. on a pilot scale. The process
involved carbonization of dry-spun ﬁbers from lignin dissolved in an alkali solution
containing poly(vinyl alcohol) as a plasticizer [62–64].
Lignin, second only to cellulose in natural abundance, is readily available, rel-
atively inexpensive and structurally appealing as a precursor for carbon ﬁbers. It is a
high molecular weight polyaromatic macromolecule with a reported total world-
wide production of approximately 26 million ton/year [65].
However, lignin-based carbon ﬁbers have a low tensile strength of approxi-
mately 0.3 GPa, in comparison with typical commercial PAN-based carbon ﬁbers
(above 3.5 GPa). Thus, a few researchers have reported the lignin-based carbon
ﬁbers with mechanical properties, which are suitable for either general purpose
(GP) or above grades, through the various pretreatment processes of lignin [66–68].
Kadla et al. [69] have reported the lignin-based carbon ﬁbers modiﬁed by the Kraft
process (a process for converting wood into wood pulp comprising almost pure
cellulose ﬁbers) and blends, thereby reaching a tensile strength of approximately
0.5 GPa and a modulus of up to 60 GPa. Kubo et al. [70] have investigated lignin-
based carbon ﬁbers by blending them with PET, which resulted in a tensile strength
of 0.7 GPa and a modulus of 94 GPa. A more recent investigation by the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory (ORNL) on lignin-based carbon ﬁbers revealed a tensile
strength of approximately 0.51 GPa and a modulus of 28.6 GPa (Fig. 1.19) [71].

History and Structure of Carbon Fibers

Despite the weak mechanical properties, the development of processes utilizing
lignin, as a low-cost and renewable resource precursor material for low-cost carbon
ﬁber production, has been relentlessly pursued. A few studies reported the possi-
bility of producing carbon ﬁbers from lignin. Also, the modiﬁcation of lignin for
producing HP-carbon ﬁbers has been studied using puriﬁcation, chemical modiﬁ-
cation, and plasticization [72–76].
Short carbon ﬁbers are being rapidly developed through preparation in the vapor
of hydrocarbon atmosphere with low molecular weight compounds, including
acetylene and ethylene. This process involves catalytic growth using solid catalyst
particles (Fe, Co, and other transition metals) to form carbon ﬁlaments, which could
be as small as 0.1 µm in diameter. They consist of graphitizable carbon and could
be transformed into graphite ﬁbers by heat treatments above 2,500 °C. Then,
subsequent chemical vapor deposition from the carbonaceous gas in the same
chamber caused the ﬁlaments to grow in diameter, resulting in vapor-grown carbon
ﬁbers (VGCFs) or gas-phase-grown carbon ﬁbers [77–80].
Unlike the complex PAN-based processes, the manufacturing process for “vapor-
grown” production technology is simpler, faster, and cheaper. As indicated in
Fig. 1.20, VGCFs are produced in the vapor phase by decomposing methane, ethane,
or coal gas in the presence of a metal catalyst, hydrogen sulﬁde, and ammonia. The
catalyzed gas decomposes into carbon and hydrogen and gets conveyed to a reactor
furnace. Carbon remains in the reactor for only a few milliseconds, growing into a
ﬁber of 60–200 nm in diameter and approximately 100 μm in length. The ﬁber is

debulked for either sale or additional processing (such as heat treatment). In partic-
ular, the process of preparing VGCFs overcame many costly production steps and
processing compared to those of the PAN-based process; it also provided an inno-
vative approach for fabricating HP ﬁbers at lower costs.
1.4.3 Commercial Availability
Carbon ﬁbers could alternatively be classiﬁed on the basis of their commercial
availability, namely GP-, HP-, and activated carbon ﬁbers (ACF).
The GP-carbon ﬁbers have low tensile strength, low tensile modulus, and low
cost because of their amorphous and isotropic structures. The greatest advantage of
these carbon ﬁbers is their low cost. The short GP-pitch-based carbon ﬁbers are
used in the reinforcement of concrete because it is easy to use in large quantities.
The GP-carbon ﬁbers are also used for thermal insulation, sealing materials, elec-
trically conducting materials, antistatic materials, heating elements, ﬁlters, fraction
materials, sorbents, and catalysts [81].
The HP-carbon ﬁbers are characterized by high strength and modulus in com-
parison with the GP-carbon ﬁbers. Among the HP-carbon ﬁbers, a higher modulus is
associated with a higher proportion of graphite and more anisotropy. The HP-carbon
ﬁbers are widely used in polymer–matrix composites for aircraft, which are light-
weight for the purpose of saving fuel. Nearly 90 % of the structure of the aircraft,
Voyager, is made of such composites. In 1986, the Voyager successfully performed
a nonstop, unfueled, round-the-world ﬂight. The use of such composites in pas-
senger aircraft is rapidly rising. The HP-carbon ﬁbers are also used in carbon–matrix
composites for high-temperature aerospace applications such as the Space Shuttle, as
the carbon matrix is more temperature resistant compared to a polymer matrix. These
ﬁbers are now used in metal matrices such as aluminum for aerospace applications as
aluminum is more temperature resistant compared to polymers.
Finally, ACFs have a large speciﬁc surface area and micropore volume for the
adsorption of either gas or liquid. Compared to the conventional granular or powder
activated carbons, ACFs have been widely used in the separation, puriﬁcation, and
catalytic processes owing to their extended speciﬁc surface area, high adsorption
capacity, highly porous structure, and special surface reactivity. ACFs have been
used not only as reducing agents by themselves but also as catalyst supports for
removing pollutants such as NOx, SOx, NH3, and even HCl [82–106]. Also, the
microstructure of ACFs is created during the activation and is affected by many
factors such as the degree of activation and carbonization conditions [107]. The
adsorption/desorption rate of carbonaceous adsorbents is greatly dependent on not
only microporous structures but also surface properties [108–110].
Most recently, ACFs have been drawing attention as adsorbents for hydrogen
storage and capture of CO2 from a thermal power plant. ACFs offer several
advantages in terms of cost with rapid adsorption kinetics, availability, large surface
area, easy-to-design pore structure, easy surface functionalization, hydrophobicity,
16

reversibility, and low energy requirements for regeneration. With regard to gas
adsorption, ACFs are also considered promising materials because of their nano-
structure, abundant micrometer porosity, and properties such as high speciﬁc sur-
face area and narrow pore size distribution. The ﬁbrous shape of ACFs has the
advantage of easy handling compared to granular and powdered adsorbents
[111–115].
In particular, the amount of CO2 adsorbed by the ACF samples (modiﬁed by
thermally chemical activation) was substantially higher than that obtained for most
other well-known adsorbent materials designed for CO2 capture, including MOF-5,
zeolite (Fig. 1.21), and activated carbons [116]. This is because of their well-
developed pore structures and inherent CO2 afﬁnity of ACF surfaces for high-
performance CO2 capture (Fig. 1.22).

1.5 Structure of Carbon Fibers
Carbon ﬁbers generally have excellent tensile properties, low densities, and high
thermal and chemical stabilities in the absence of oxidizing agents, good thermal
and electrical conductivities, and excellent creep resistance. They have been
extensively used in composites in the form of woven textiles, prepregs, continuous
ﬁbers/rovings, and chopped ﬁbers. The composite parts could be produced through
ﬁlament winding, tape winding, pultrusion, compression molding, vacuum bagging,
liquid molding, and injection molding.
Several techniques, including wide- and small-angle X-ray diffraction, electron
diffraction, transmission, scamming and surface replica electron microscopy, and
optical microscopy, have been investigated for the structure of carbon ﬁbers
[117–121]. From these techniques, valuable information about the various micro-
and macroaspects of the ﬁber structure has been provided continually hitherto such
as qualitative and quantitative information about several structural parameters,
including crystallite size and orientation, stack height and width, shape and size of
pores, and presence of three-dimensional order.
Here, we will brieﬂy summarize the unique structures of carbon ﬁbers as dis-
covered using X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, which are the simplest
and most effective techniques for the elucidation and foundational understanding of
the basic science of structure in carbon ﬁbers.
Carbon ﬁbers could be either short or continuous. In addition, the structure of
carbon ﬁbers could be crystalline, amorphous, or partly crystalline. The atomic
structure of a carbon ﬁber is similar to that of graphite wherein the c-direction
distance between the layer planes is 3.35 Å (d-spacing, d(002)) and consists of
carbon atom layers arranged in a regular hexagonal pattern (as previously shown in
Fig. 1.1). It has a high modulus, 0.18–0.35 GPa; however, in humid atmosphere, its
shear strength is weak along the a-axis.
In graphitic crystalline regions (microdomains), the crystal structure of carbon
ﬁbers consists of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms arranged two-dimensionally in a
honeycomb structure in the x–y plane with van der Waals forces, which are stacked
parallel to one another in a regular fashion. In the graphite layer, the carbon atoms
are bonded covalently and through metallic bonds owing to the overlap of the sp2
hybridized orbital and delocalization of the pz orbitals (the π electrons), respec-
tively. The good electrical and thermal conductivity of graphite are attributable to
the delocalization in the x–y plane.
However, the basic structural unit of most of the carbon ﬁbers consists of a
stack of turbostratic layers. In a turbostratic structure, the distance between the
parallel graphene sheets is greater than that in graphite (Fig. 1.23). The basic
structural unit could either irregularly or haphazardly split, tilt, twist, fold, and
join other basic structural units to form microdomains. As shown in Fig. 1.24,
these microdomains could also split, tilt, twist, fold, and join each other in carbon
ﬁbers [121]. Thus, the structure of carbon ﬁbers is not homogeneous. It has been
18

reported that the irregular stacking and presence of sp3 bonding could increase the
d-spacing to 3.44 Å [122, 123].
Johnson and Watt [124] have investigated the crystallite structure of PAN-based
carbon ﬁbers treated at 2,500 °C and found that the turbostratic crystallites had Lc
(crystallite height) of at least 12 layer planes and La (crystallite width) of 6–12 nm.
Both Lc and La tended to increase with the heat treatment temperature.
The basic structural unit and some of the microdomains were initially established
by the ﬁber formation process, including the precursors and processing conditions.
Generally, it is known that a well-stacked graphitic crystalline structure could
only be observed in the mesophase pitch and vapor-grown carbon ﬁbers, while the
turbostratic structure could be observed in carbon ﬁbers with other precursors such

as PAN. In the graphitization of stabilized PAN-based ﬁbers, the crystalline domain
is developed by either amalgamating with adjacent crystallites or incorporating the
surrounding disorganized carbons. Furthermore, the layer planes within the crys-
talline domain relocated through rotating and shifting. However, these arrange-
ments had appeared locally and the graphite ﬁbers still possessed signiﬁcant
turbostratic domains with the existence of extensive rotational disordering of layer
planes.
Bourrat et al. [125] reported that noncarbonized mesophase pitch-based ﬁbers
exhibited three levels of structural organization. The same three levels of organi-
zation, with slight modiﬁcation, could be applied to all types of carbon ﬁbers. These
are as follows:
1. At the molecular range level, molecules are stacked together creating small
coherent domains, as in the starting mesophase pitch, known as “basic structural
units.”
2. At the next level of organization, i.e., from one to a few hundred nm, a mi-
crotexture is observed. It is deﬁned by microdomains which consist of assem-
blies of molecules with a long-range orientation order. These microdomains are
elongated along the ﬁber-axis direction, up to several μm, and limited laterally
by pores and wedge disclinations. The descriptive “micro” is used here to
specify this level of organization. The characteristics of the basic structural unit
and microtexture are determined using a combination of wide-angle X-ray
scattering (WAXS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), selected area dif-
fraction (SAD) by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and use of bright-
and dark-ﬁeld imaging in the TEM.
3. The last level of organization deﬁnes the ﬁbers’ texture. It reﬂects the changing
statistical orientation of the molecules at a very long range. The texture is readily
observed in the SEM and could be deduced through the optical microscope
studies with the acid of reﬂected polarized light (detailed information and
optical images are shown in [125]).
Figure 1.25 shows the basic structural unit at the several stages during the
conversion of a ﬁber from the stabilized material to graphite. At low temperatures,
after stabilization, the oriented basic structural units were isolated and the hetero
atoms were eliminated at the higher temperatures. Then, some stacks were formed
by assembling the oriented basic structural units, which led to the creation of pores
and increase the densiﬁcation. At higher temperatures, some microdomains were
formed as the dense and orderly structures. At further higher temperatures, disor-
dered layers of turbostratic carbon appeared. Finally, at extreme temperatures,
planar layers of graphite resulted. The change in the perfection and ordering of
carbon in ﬁbers could be readily observed using high-resolution electron
microscopes.

1.6 State of Carbon Fiber Industry
1.6.1 Technology Development Trends
Carbon ﬁbers have remarkable properties such as tensile strength, stiffness, low
density, electrical conductivity, and chemical inertness. Carbon ﬁbers have been
used to manufacture sports cars as well as sports equipment such as ﬁshing rods,
golf shafts, and tennis racquets. Currently, a great deal of attention is being paid to
reduce the weight of passenger vehicles to increase vehicle fuel economy and lower
the greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, carbon ﬁbers are now used in aircraft and
industrial applications such as pressure vessels, windmills, civil engineering/con-
struction-related uses, and cars and yachts.
However, owing to the tricky and multistage manufacturing processes of carbon
ﬁbers, only eight companies, including Toray, Toho Tenax, Mitsubishi Chemical,
Hexcel, and Zoltek, have succeeded in the mass production of carbon ﬁbers. In each
country, the export of carbon ﬁbers is strictly prohibited because carbon ﬁbers are
widely used in the state-of-the-art weapons. In addition, historically, the carbon
ﬁber industry has been cyclical with a period of limited supply resulting in high
prices to periods of oversupply resulting in falling prices.

Toray leads in the development of high-performance carbon ﬁbers. Figure 1.26
shows the classiﬁcation of high-performance carbon ﬁbers made by Toray. In
particular, T (Torayca)-1,000 contains high-performance carbon ﬁbers with a ten-
sile strength of 7 GPa and a tensile modulus 300 GPa, which enabled the diver-
siﬁcation of the application ﬁelds. Figure 1.27 presents the application based on the
mechanical characteristics of regular carbon ﬁbers [127].

1.6.2 Utility Development Trends
Figure 1.28 shows the trends and compound annual growth rates (CAGR) of carbon
ﬁber applications until 2020 [127]. After the storm of the ﬁnancial crisis in 2009,
the market for carbon ﬁbers gradually increased. The demand for carbon ﬁbers is
classiﬁed into industrial, sporting goods, and aerospace applications. The sporting
goods is one of the oldest applications for carbon ﬁbers, but it is experiencing only
modest growth, as there are no new signiﬁcant applications to be expected.
The industrial sector of the market breadth and CAGR has led to the expanded
market for carbon ﬁbers. The industrial sector is also growing in importance with a
wide range of applications. The industrial sector overall, excluding aerospace and
sporting goods, is forecast to represent more than 75 % of the total usage of carbon
ﬁbers by 2020 (see below).
• Energy: blades for wind power, pressure vessels, electrode gas diffusion layers
for fuel cells, offshore oil industry, high-risers;
• Transportation: vehicle parts (for weight reduction, safety, and environment),
marine parts (decks, hulls, and masts);
• Civil engineering (antivibration plate, bridges, and lightweight buildings);
• Industrial equipment: rollers for printing machines, PC frames, machine com-
ponents, medical components.
It is noteworthy that the demand for carbon ﬁbers will increase with the
increasing quality of the entire life cycle and the importance of the environmental
issues.

applications (Toray) [127]

In the meantime, the CAGR of the aerospace sector is somewhat sluggish. In the
next few years, it is expected to increase substantially owing to the demand of large
aerospace companies (such as Boeing and Airbus) for the development of carbon
ﬁber composites, which could result in the weight reduction and fuel savings.
1.6.3 Market Trends
Since 1971, Toray Co. [127] has been manufacturing PAN-based carbon ﬁbers
using a proprietary technology and became the top carbon ﬁber manufacturer in the
world, capturing 34 % (regular tow) of the global market share with a production
capacity of 7,600 ton/year. Toray has shifted its focus from the aviation, space,
sports, and industrial sectors and directed attention toward the carbon ﬁber com-
posites for the Boeing Aircraft. In addition, they have developed the carbon ﬁber
manufacturing techniques such as precursor emulsion, stretching, mixed spinning,
carbonization/graphitization techniques for carbon ﬁbers, and molding of carbon
ﬁber composites to obtain the high-performance carbon ﬁbers. The steady devel-
opment of a variety of purposes and usages for the carbon ﬁbers has been observed.
Toho Tenax Co. [128], since 1975, has manufactured high-performance PAN-based
carbon ﬁbers and ﬂame-retardant ﬁbers. It ranked second in the world with a
production capacity of 5,600 ton/year. The company has also gained recognition in
the aircraft industry. They supplied the entire structural components required for
manufacturing vertical tail wings and ﬂooring of Airbus A380, which occupies part
of the 70 % of the aircraft industry. Toho Tenax Co. has also developed industrial
components such as spring, rotor, and brake, and reinforced technology for concrete
structure. Since 1976, Mitsubishi Chemical Co. [129] has produced prepregs using
the high-performance carbon ﬁbers obtained from Courtaulds Co. (England). Later,
carbon ﬁbers were produced through a technical partnership with HITCO Co.
(USA) since 1983. With a production capacity of approximately 3,400 ton/year,
Mitsubishi was ranked third in the world. Then, Hexcel Co. [130], Cytec Co. [131],
and Formosa Co. [132] accelerated the manufacture and development of carbon
ﬁbers. Table 1.2 lists the PAN-based carbon ﬁber manufacturers and their markets
in the world.
Table 1.3 lists the pitch-based carbon ﬁber manufacturers and their respective
market shares in the world. As listed in Table 1.3, the pitch-based carbon ﬁbers
have a relatively smaller market size compared to the PAN-based carbon ﬁbers.
While the universal type of pitch-based carbon ﬁbers was used as ﬁllers and
insulating materials, the high-performance pitch-based carbon ﬁbers were com-
peting with the PAN-based carbon ﬁbers in the ﬁeld of advanced composites
materials, which resulted in the creation of a new market owing to their unique
characteristics. In particular, it is expected that the mesophase pitch-based carbon
ﬁber market will grow signiﬁcantly in the aerospace sector for applications in
extreme environments such as the structure of the antenna and exterior materials of
electronic devices.

History and Structure of Carbon Fibers

1.7 Summary
In this chapter, we have provided a brief overview of carbon ﬁbers, showing
superior performance and comprising expensive materials, in that the origin, his-
tory, manufacturing technology, performance, and world market trends.
Despite the high performance, the carbon ﬁbers were only used for military
purposes and aerospace/aviation owing to the higher price. Recently, carbon ﬁbers
have attracted attention for their potential use as structural materials in aerospace,
sports, cars, and bridges. Also, carbon ﬁbers have been considered as the next-
generation materials in the aerospace/aviation industry, which has presented a huge
opportunity to the entire supply chain of carbon ﬁbers.

Abstract In this chapter, we will present the precursors and manufacturing of
carbon ﬁbers. Among the precursors used for the production of carbon ﬁbers,
polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based and pitch-based precursors are the most important. A
signiﬁcant amount of work has been done on relating the ﬁber structure to the
properties and translating that relationship into production for either reducing cost
or increasing ﬁber properties. However, challenges, including cost reduction,
improvement in tensile and compressive strength, and alternative precursor
development, still remain. We will also introduce many linear and cyclic polymers
for carbon ﬁbers, which is expected to open the door for the low-cost carbon ﬁbers.
2.1 Introduction
Carbon ﬁbers are novel high-performance materials. They could be described as ﬁbers
containing at least 90 % carbon obtained by the controlled pyrolysis of appropriate
ﬁbers. Edison in 1879 found that carbon ﬁbers can be used as carbon ﬁlaments in
electric lamps. Since the early work of Edison, the carbon ﬁbers have been investi-
gated and used intensively because they generally have excellent tensile properties,
low densities, high thermal and chemical stabilities in the absence of oxidizing agents,
good thermal and electrical conductivities, and excellent creep resistance [1–16].
In recent years, the carbon ﬁber industry has been growing steadily to meet the
demands arising from different applications such as aerospace (aircraft and space
systems), military, turbine blades, construction, lightweight cylinders and pressure
vessels, medical, automobile, and sporting goods. Furthermore, in the case of the
carbon ﬁbers, the range of their applications would depend on the type of precursors
used to produce the carbon ﬁbers. Consequently, many types of precursors have
been studied to produce the carbon ﬁbers. The ideal features of precursors required

to manufacture carbon ﬁbers are easy conversion to carbon ﬁber, high carbon yield,
and cost-effective processing. From this perspective, the following four types of
precursors have been widely used, which have also proven to be the most popular
ones [17–31]:
1. Acrylic precursors: They have been successfully used for carbon ﬁber prepa-
ration by most industrial manufacturers for quite some time now. These acrylic
precursors contain >85 % acrylonitrile (AN) monomer. In particular, polyac-
rylonitrile (PAN) is the most popular acrylic precursor, which is used widely to
produce the carbon ﬁbers.
2. Cellulosic precursors: They contain 44.4 % carbon. However, in practice, the
reaction is more complicated than mere dehydration, and the carbon yield is
only approximately 25–30 %.
3. Pitch-based precursors: They have a yield of 85 %, and the resultant carbon
ﬁbers from these precursors show a high modulus owing to the more graphitic
nature. On the other hand, the pitch-based carbon ﬁbers have poorer compres-
sion and transverse properties compared to the PAN-based carbon ﬁbers.
4. Other forms of precursors: Vinylidene chloride and phenolic resins as precursors
for the manufacture of carbon ﬁbers have been investigated, but were not found
to be commercially viable.
2.2 Acrylic Precursors
Various acrylic precursors have been utilized to produce carbon ﬁbers for use in
carbon-ﬁber-based composite applications owing to certain desirable physical
properties [32, 33]. The acrylic precursors for the carbon ﬁber industry originated
from the companies that were established commercial-scale producers of textile-
grade acrylic ﬁbers. This was because the carbon ﬁbers were produced through the
pyrolysis of the acrylic ﬁbers. Therefore, the manufacturers of carbon ﬁbers could
most readily adapt the existing technology for precursors to manufacture carbon
ﬁbers. The manufacturing processes of acrylic precursors by various manufacturers
are listed in Table 2.1. In particular, the resultant carbon ﬁbers from acrylic pre-
cursors such as PAN-based carbon ﬁbers have been widely used as reinforcing
materials in automobile, aerospace, recreational, and various other industries
[34–37].
2.2.1 PAN Precursors
PAN-based polymer precursors for carbon ﬁbers could be primarily classiﬁed into
pure homopolymer and comonomers. Generally, the comonomers are widely used
in PAN-based polymer precursors to manufacture carbon ﬁbers [38–40].
32

Precursors and Manufacturing of Carbon Fibers

The homopolymer PAN product is slightly difﬁcult to process into carbon ﬁbers
because the initial oxidation stage of the process cannot be easily controlled owing
to the sudden and rapid evolution of heat, coupled with a relatively high initiation
temperature. Such heat could result in poor properties of carbon ﬁbers owing to the
chain scission from the thermal shock. It is known that the homopolymer PAN
product has never been used as a precursor for manufacturing carbon ﬁbers. To
overcome the resultant poor properties in the carbon ﬁbers due to the rapid evo-
lution of heat, the exothermic reaction should be adequately controlled using
suitable comonomers such as itaconic acid.
On the other hand, as mentioned above, the comonomers could exert a signiﬁ-
cant effect on the stabilization process, thereby enhancing the segmental mobility of
the polymer chains resulting in better orientation and mechanical properties of the
precursor and manufactured carbon ﬁbers. In addition, the selection of suitable
comonomers could reduce the initial temperature of cyclization in the manufac-
turing process of carbon ﬁbers. Therefore, several researchers have discussed the
effect of comonomer composition on the properties of the PAN precursor and
resultant carbon ﬁbers.
Vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate (VAc), methacrylate (MA), and methyl
methacrylate (MMA) could be used as comonomers for AN, though VAc might not
be an appropriate carbon ﬁber precursor [41–44]. These comonomers act like a
plasticizer and break up the structure to make the polymer more readily soluble in the
spinning solvent, thereby improving the quality of spinning, modifying the ﬁber
morphology and where appropriate, and improving the rate of diffusion of the dye
into the ﬁbers. However, the comonomers should be minimally used for establishing
good properties in the carbon ﬁbers because they could affect the cyclization step in
the manufacturing process of carbon ﬁbers. Table 2.2 lists the possible comonomers.
These monomers have similar reactivities, and the resulting polymer compositions
will have more or less the same composition as the monomers in the feed.
Carboxylic acids could be used as effective comonomers because their presence
affects the ease of oxidation, exothermicity, and carbon yield of the precursor. In
addition, itaconic and methacrylic acids have been conﬁrmed to be most effective

comonomers for reducing the exothermicity. Previous studies involving acrylic
acid, acrylamide, sodium acrylate, and different acidic comonomers conﬁrmed that
the effectiveness of comonomers was in the following order: itaconic acid >meth-
acrylic acid >acrylic acid >acrylamide [40]. The superiority of itaconic acid results
from the presence of two carboxylic acid groups, which increases the possibility of
interacting with a nitrile group. In other words, if one carboxylic acid group of
itaconic acid moved away from an adjacent nitrile group owing to the dipole–dipole
repulsion, the other carboxylic acid group could move into the vicinity of a nitrile
group, thereby facilitating participation in the cyclization process [45, 46].
2.2.2 Polymerization Methods for Production of PAN-Based
Precursors
Acrylic precursors such as AN and comonomers are initiated by free radical
reaction and can be polymerized by one of the several methods listed below:
1. Solution polymerization: This method is used to prepare AN and comonomers
by dissolving a monomer and catalyst in a nonreactive solvent. During this
reaction, the solvent absorbs the heat generated by the chemical reaction and
controls the reaction rate. The solvent used in the polymerization process usu-
ally remains as a solvent for the acrylic precursors (reactant). This process is
only suitable for the creation of wet polymer types because the excess solvent is
difﬁcult to remove. During this reaction, the solvent absorbs the heat generated

by the chemical reaction and controls the reaction rate. The solvent used in the
polymerization process usually remains as a solvent for the acrylic precursors
(reactant). This process is only suitable for the creation of wet polymer types
because the excess solvent is difﬁcult to remove. Although the removal of
excess solvent is possible using distillation, this method is usually not com-
mercially viable. This polymerization method for the preparation of PAN-based
precursors offers a few advantages as along with one major disadvantage [47].
2. Bulk polymerization: This method is the simplest and direct way of synthesizing
polymers. This polymerization is carried out by adding a soluble initiator to a
pure, liquid monomer. The initiator dissolves in the monomer, and the reaction
is initiated by either heating or exposure to radiation. The mixture becomes
viscous as the reaction proceeds. At that instant, the reaction is exothermic and a
reactant with a broad molecular weight distribution is produced. Therefore, this
polymerization method for the preparation of PAN-based precursors is used in
the small-scale manufacturing process, wherein it is easy to remove the reaction
heat [48].
3. Emulsion polymerization: This method is a type of radical polymerization,
which is usually carried out with an emulsion containing water, monomer, and
surfactant. The PAN-based precursors are often made commercially using
emulsion polymerization [49].
4. Aqueous dispersion polymerization: This method is useful to prepare micro- or
submicron-scale monodisperse polymer particles in a single step. In this poly-
merization method, all reaction materials are dissolved in the reaction medium
in the initial stage of the polymerization. Then, insoluble spherical polymer
particles, stabilized using steric molecules, are formed and dispersed in the
reaction medium. PAN-based precursors could be prepared using this poly-
merization method with an ionic monomer to attain a narrow particle size dis-
tribution with a mean diameter as low as approximately 3 ± 1.5 μm [50].
2.2.3 Manufacture of Carbon Fibers from PAN-Based
Precursors
As mentioned earlier, the PAN-based polymers are the optimum precursors for the
carbon ﬁbers owing to a combination of tensile and compressive properties as well
as the carbon yield. The PAN-based ﬁbers were ﬁrst developed by Dupont in the
1940s for use in the textile ﬁber. The thermal stability of PAN-based ﬁbers was an
important factor in expanding the application of ﬁbers. Later, this property led to
further research on the heat treatment of PAN ﬁbers. In the early 1960s, PAN ﬁbers
were ﬁrst carbonized and graphitized by Shindo at the Government Industrial
Research Institute, Osaka, Japan, and these, in the early 1960s, PAN ﬁbers were
ﬁrst carbonized and graph 112 GPa, respectively [51]. The process involved
employing tension in both stabilization and carbonization steps. According to

Toray, Shindo’s patent was licensed to Toray in 1970 by the Japanese Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI) to produce PAN-based Torayca carbon
ﬁbers. During the 1960s, Watt and Johnson at the Royal Aircraft Establishment,
England, and Bacon and Hoses at Union Carbide, the USA, also developed a
method for producing carbon ﬁbers from PAN [52–54].
The manufacturing steps for producing the carbon ﬁbers from PAN could be
categorized as follows as shown in Fig. 2.1: polymerization of PAN-based pre-
cursors, spinning of ﬁbers, thermal stabilization, carbonization, and graphitization.
The manufacturing steps for producing the carbon ﬁbers from PAN-based pre-
cursors could be categorized as follows as shown in Fig. 2.1: polymerization of
PAN-based precursors, spinning of ﬁbers, thermal stabilization (oxidation), car-
bonization, and graphitization Fig. 2.1. In addition, these PAN-based copolymers
containing 2–15 % acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, MA, and/or itaconic acid are
generally used as precursors of carbon ﬁbers produced through carbonization
because the use of comonomers affects the molecular alignment and stabilization
conditions. The typical carbon yield from PAN-based precursors is approximately
50–60 % [55].
The typical manufacturing steps involved in the production of carbon ﬁbers from
PAN-based precursors are listed below:
1. Polymerization of PAN-based precursors and spinning of ﬁbers
The PAN polymer precursor has been widely used as the basic backbone of
chemical structure for spinning precursor ﬁbers. Figure 2.2 shows the chemical
structure of PAN. In addition, the commercial PAN-based polymer precursors
used for spinning the precursor ﬁbers usually contain approximately 2–10 % of
a comonomer such as methyl acrylate (MA), MMA, or itacon acids (ITA). Most
carbon companies manufacture their own precursors by in-house technologies.
Consequently, the composition of the PAN polymer precursor is not well known
because it can control the properties of the ﬁnal products.
Generally, the PAN polymer precursors contain polar nitrile groups and have a
high melting point, resulting from strong intermolecular interactions. Therefore,
Fig. 2.1 Schematic for manufacturing process of carbon ﬁbers from PAN-based precursors

the PAN polymer precursors tend to degrade before the temperature reaches
their melting point. The spinning of PAN ﬁbers in the carbon ﬁber industry is
performed using traditional manufacturing techniques of acrylic textile ﬁbers.
Wet spinning is used in most of the commercial manufacturing processes of
carbon ﬁbers produced from PAN-based polymer precursors. However, it is
gradually being replaced by dry jet wet (air gap) spinning [56]. The melt
spinning of PAN-based polymer precursors has been previously practised;
however, it has yet to become an acceptable manufacturing process of carbon
ﬁbers, commercially [57–59]. Figure 2.3 shows the typical layout of a plant for
processing PAN-based ﬁbers.
2. Thermal stabilization (oxidation)
This process is critical to obtaining high-quality carbon ﬁbers and could take up
to several hours, depending on the temperature, precursor diameter, and pre-
cursor ﬁber characteristics [60–70]. Proper conditions such as heating rate, time,

and temperature of heating should be established for the optimum stabilization
of each precursor. The PAN-based polymer precursor is stabilized by controlled
low-temperature heating over the range 200–300 °C in air to convert the pre-
cursor to a form, which could be further heat-treated without either the melting
or fusion of the ﬁbers [71].
In this process, the linear molecules of PAN-based polymer precursor are ﬁrst
converted into cyclic structures. However, the cyclization is a complicated
process, the mechanism of which is still unclear. In general, the most widely
known reaction mechanism is shown in Fig. 2.4.
3. Carbonization and graphitization
The carbonization and graphitization of thermally stabilized ﬁbers are carried
out in an inert atmosphere containing gases such as nitrogen (N2) or Ar [72].
Generally, N2 is the preferred gas, but Ar is used despite being eight times more
expensive. This is because Ar provides improved strength to the carbon ﬁber
owing to the higher density and viscosity of argon. The temperature of car-
bonization is usually determined by the type of application of the resulting
carbon ﬁbers. For high-strength applications, the carbonization temperature over
the range 1,500–1,600 °C is preferred because at temperatures above 1,600 °C, a
decrease in the tensile strength occurs. On the other hand, an additional heat
treatment above 1,600–1,800 °C and up to 3,000 °C, i.e., graphitization process,
is required to obtain a high modulus in the carbon ﬁbers [73, 74] Nitrogen
cannot be used at temperatures above approximately 2,000 °C owing to its
reaction with carbon to form cyanogen. The heating rate and retention time
during carbonization are different depending on the type of the precursor and
stabilization conditions. Figure 2.5 shows the typical tensile strength (GPa) of
the

temperature.
As mentioned above, the carbonization and graphitization of the thermally
stabilized ﬁbers is a two-step process, i.e., low-temperature carbonization and
high-temperature graphitization, depending on the requisite properties of the
carbon ﬁbers. Bromley et al. [75] conﬁrmed that the gases evolved during the
carbonization of PAN-based carbon ﬁbers over the low-temperature range
200–1,000 °C, and the observed gases are listed in Table 2.3.
Figure 2.6 shows the schematic of the graphite structure. Dehydrogenation
joined the ladder molecules to form graphite-like ribbons; however, denitro-
genation made the ribbons to form sheet-like structures. On the other hand, the
high carbonization temperature caused the ordered structure to grow in both
thickness and area, increased the crystalline orientation in the ﬁber direction,

and reduced the interlayer spacing and void content. In addition, the graphite
structures could further grow at higher temperatures resulting from the elimi-
nation of N2.
4. Surface treatment and washing
Generally, the surface treatment of carbon ﬁbers was performed to improve the
mechanical properties of the composite through alteration of the ﬁber surface. In
many companies, the treatment method of the surface of carbon ﬁbers is still
kept conﬁdential. The most often used surface treatment methods for carbon
ﬁbers could be categorized as liquid and gaseous oxidation treatments. The
liquid oxidation treatment is well known and could double the composite shear
strengths with slight reductions (4–6 %) in ﬁber tensile strengths [76].
Among the oxidation treatment methods of the liquid type, the anodic oxidation
treatment method has been widely used in the surface treatment of commercial
carbon ﬁbers because it is inexpensive, fast, and efﬁcient. Figure 2.7 shows the

schematic of the surface treatment and washing baths. In this method, Faraday’s
Law applies and 96,500 C liberates 1 g equivalent of O2. The duration of the
surface treatment is related to the line speed. In addition, the current density as a
standard variable is used to control the treatment level per unit length of carbon
ﬁber during the surface treatment, usually expressed as C/m.
The electrically conductive carbon ﬁbers form the anode during the electrolysis
of an acid or a salt solution such as nitric acid (HNO3), sulfuric acid (H2SO4),
ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4), and ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) [77].
One of the electrolytes, ammonium sulfate, is usually used in the commercial
surface treatment processes of carbon ﬁbers. This causes the carbonyl containing
groups such as COOH to form on the smooth ﬁber surface. The carbonyl groups
improve the cohesion between the ﬁber and resin used in the ﬁnal composite.
After this surface treatment, the excess electrolyte is removed using warm water
wash treatment. The carbon ﬁbers are then passed onto the next process through
one or more water baths constantly ﬂowing with water.
Currently, the demand for the surface treatment of carbon ﬁbers has signiﬁcantly
increased
with
increasing
necessity
for
high-performance

composites.
5. Drying, sizing, and winding
Carbon ﬁbers require some protection or lubrication for the ease of handling
because of their brittleness. The carbon ﬁbers are predried for the sizing treat-
ment, and the sizing materials are selected such that they protect the physical
characteristics of carbon ﬁbers. These sizing materials need to provide consis-
tent handling and not build up residue on the processing equipment. The sizing
Fig. 2.7 Schematic of surface treatment and washing baths
42

Precursors and Manufacturing of Carbon Fibers

materials also need to be compatible with the matrix resin. This includes sol-
ubility in and/or reactivity with the formulated resin. This allows the resin to
penetrate the ﬁber bundle and interact with the ﬁber surface. Generally, the
epoxy resins or epoxy formulations are used as sizing materials. The sizing
materials should not change either the chemical or physical characteristics of the
carbon ﬁbers during storage. Some sizing materials are water soluble and
washable after either weaving or braiding [78].
The ﬁber sizing, process to apply sizing, and sizing content are considered to be
critical factors in the carbon ﬁber speciﬁcation. The type of size material and
particle size of the aqueous dispersion must be controlled to establish good
properties in the carbon ﬁbers after sizing. From these viewpoints, the types of
emulsiﬁer and resin and their respective concentrations are key to improving the
characteristics of the carbon ﬁbers. The control of wetting in the sizing bath is
needed to control the level of size on the carbon ﬁbers. All the steps pertaining
to the application of the sizing to the carbon ﬁber and drying must also be
consistent (Fig. 2.8).
Many sizing materials such as epoxy resins are not soluble in water and must be
applied as a dispersion of emulsion in water. This could result in the sizing
being uniformly distributed on the surface of the ﬁbers. Alternately, the sizing
materials could exist as either droplets on the ﬁber surface or by sticking
together a number of individual ﬁbers. The particle size of the emulsion in the
sizing bath is controlled to provide a dependable product.
Meanwhile, the dried carbon ﬁbers after the sizing treatment are collected using
winders. The winding machines generally operate automatically. In addition, the
winders could usually produce ﬁnished spools of up to 12 kg in weight.

2.2.4 Types of Polyacrylonitrile-Based Carbon Fibers
There are three basic categories of PAN-based carbon ﬁbers:
1. Large tow: Inexpensive to manufacture can be conveniently chopped to a staple
form
2. General purpose grades: Less stringent product qualiﬁcation
3. Aerospace grades: Premium-grade products
Each category of carbon ﬁbers is available in several production types, which are
based on their tensile strength and modulus:
• general purpose
• high strength
• intermediate modulus
• high modulus
2.3 Cellulosic Precursors
2.3.1 Cellulosic Precursors
Cellulose as a precursor for making carbon ﬁbers was ﬁrst used by Thomas Edison
in the 1880s for his revolutionary electric lamp ﬁlament. Almost 80 years later, in
1959, the National Carbon Company (a division of Union Carbide) produced a
carbon cloth from a rayon precursor, and two years later, in 1961, a carbon yarn was
introduced [79]. In 1965, Thornel series—carbon ﬁbers with a tensile strength of
1.25 GPa and a Young’s modulus of 170 GPa—was introduced [80]. The properties
of these carbon ﬁbers were improved by postcarbonization treatment involving
stretching at 2,500 °C. However, the production of these carbon ﬁbers was delayed
by more than 10 years because of the high cost of the heat stretching process, lower
yield, and properties of the cellulose precursor.
Ford and Mitchell [81] proposed a process, which could be used for rayon
monoﬁlaments, cellulosic yarns, or prewoven rayon textile material. Their process
involved a controlled heating process comprising heating at 10 °C/h up to 100,
50 °C/h up to 400 and 100 °C/h up to approximately 900 °C, followed by heating
up to 3,000 °C until the graphitization had occurred. A protective atmosphere of
nitrogen or other inert gases was used when heating over the range 900–3,000 °C.
The resultant carbon ﬁbers from this process showed improved tensile strength
compared to the earlier carbon ﬁbers. Furthermore, the stronger graphitic structure
in these carbon ﬁbers was conﬁrmed using X-ray patterns [82, 83].
Tang and Bacon [84] proposed the four simpliﬁed stages mentioned below for
the conversion of cellulose to carbon:
44
2
Precursors and Manufacturing of Carbon Fibers

1. Stage I: Physical desorption of approximately 12 % absorbed water (25–150 °C)
with a small degree of change in the lateral order.
2. Stage II: Dehydration from the –H and –OH fragments present in the cellulose
unit (150–240 °C). IR shows that –C = O and –C–C– are involved, and hence,
dehydration is essentially intramolecular.
3. Stage III: Thermal cleavage of the glycosidic linkage and scission of other
C = O and some C–C bonds via a free radical reaction (240–400 °C) which
leads to the formation of large amounts of tar, H2O, CO and CO2.
4. Stage IV: Aromatization (400 °C and above), wherein each cellulose unit breaks
down into a residue containing four C atoms, which then polymerize through
condensation reactions involving the removal of –H above 400 °C into a C-
polymer with a graphite-like structure.
Strong [85] described the small-scale heat treatment of rayon precursors for
stress graphitization. Because stress graphitization was to be accomplished at
approximately 2,800 °C, any nonuniformity in the yarn could lead to either a
nonuniform stretch or breakage during the stretching process. Therefore, it was
essential that the ﬁber be well supported and transported by rollers. The rayon
textile ﬁnish was removed by extraction with boiling water, and as far as could be
ascertained, no ﬂame resistant ﬁnish was applied.
The pyrolysis process was undertaken with either: (i) a continuous treatment for
approximately 7 min in oxygen at 260–280 °C or (ii) a batch treatment for
approximately 20 h in air at 225 °C with 40 % weight loss, followed by 7 min in O2
to afford a total weight loss of 50–55 %. To initiate the development of the ﬁnal
carbon structure and sufﬁciently improve the strength to enable stress-carboniza-
tion, treatment in N2 for 1.5 min at 350 °C was carried out. The material was
carbonized over the range 900–2,000 °C and graphitized over the range
2,800–2,900 °C. X-ray diffraction studies showed that the starting material Cellu-
lose II was converted to the Cellulose IV structure before degradation commenced.
It was observed that during pyrolysis in air, shrinkage occurred at approximately
25–45 % weight loss, associated with a tendency to kink if the yarn was not under
tension. So, the pyrolysis stage was deliberately limited to postpone the second
weight loss stage to the carbonization step, during which sufﬁcient tension could be
applied to prevent kinking.
2.3.2 Rayon Precursor for Production of Cellulose-Based
Carbon Fibers
Cellulose is a promising precursor for carbon ﬁber production. In addition, through
pyrolysis, it forms strong carbon ﬁbers, and the cellulosic precursors have high
thermal conductivity, high purity, mechanical ﬂexibility, and low precursor cost
[86]. The regenerated cellulose ﬁber precursors used to make carbon ﬁbers are
viscose, cuprammonium rayon, or rayon textile-grade rayon.

1. Viscose rayon [87]
The process of manufacturing viscose rayon consists of the following steps
mentioned, in the order in which they are carried out: (1) steeping, (2) pressing,
(3) shredding, (4) aging, (5) xanthation, (6) dissolving, (7) ripening, (8) ﬁltering,
(9) degassing, (10) spinning, (11) drawing, (12) washing, and (13) cutting. The
various steps involved in the process of manufacturing viscose are shown in
Fig. 2.9.
(1)
Steeping
Cellulose pulp is immersed in 17–20 % aqueous sodium hydroxide
(NaOH) over the temperature range 18–25 °C to swell the cellulose ﬁbers
and convert the cellulose to alkali cellulose.

(2)
Pressing
The swollen alkali cellulose mass is pressed to a wet weight equivalent of
2.5–3.0 times the original pulp weight to obtain an accurate ratio of alkali
to cellulose.
(3)
Shredding
The pressed alkali cellulose is shredded mechanically to yield ﬁnely
divided, ﬂuffy particles called “crumbs.” This step provides increased
surface area of the alkali cellulose, thereby increasing its ability to react in
the steps that follow.
(4)
Aging
The alkali cellulose is aged under controlled conditions of time and
temperature (between 18 and 30 °C) in order to depolymerize the cel-
lulose to the desired degree of polymerization. In this step, the average
molecular weight of the original pulp is reduced by a factor of two to
three. The reduction of the cellulose is done to get a viscose solution of
right viscosity and cellulose concentration.
(5)
Xanthation
In this step, the aged alkali cellulose crumbs are placed in vats and are
allowed to react with carbon disulﬁde under controlled temperature
(20–30 °C) to form cellulose xanthate.
ðC6H9O4ONaÞn þ nCS2 ! ðC6H9O4OSCSNaÞn
Side reactions, which occur along with the conversion of alkali cellulose
to cellulose xanthate, are responsible for the orange color of the xanthate
crumb as well as the resulting viscose solution. The orange cellulose
xanthate crumb is dissolved in dilute sodium hydroxide at 15–20 °C
under high-shear mixing conditions to obtain a viscous orange colored
solution called “viscose,” which is the basis for the manufacturing pro-
cess. The viscose solution is then ﬁltered (to remove the insoluble ﬁber
material) and deaerated.
(6)
Dissolving
The yellow crumb is dissolved in an aqueous caustic solution. The large
xanthate substituents on cellulose force the chains apart, reducing the
interchain hydrogen bonds and allowing water molecules to solvate and
separate the chains, thereby leading to a solution of the otherwise
insoluble cellulose. Because of the blocks of the unxanthated cellulose in
the crystalline regions, the yellow crumb is not completely soluble at this
stage. Because the cellulose xanthate solution (or more accurately, sus-
pension) has high viscosity, it has been termed “viscose.”
(7)
Ripening
The viscose is allowed to stand for a period of time to “ripen.” Two
important processes occur during ripening: redistribution and loss of
xanthate groups. The reversible xanthation reaction allows some of the
xanthate groups to revert to the cellulosic hydroxyls and free CS2. This
2.3
Cellulosic Precursors
47

free CS2 can then either escape or react with other hydroxyls on other
portions of the cellulose chain. In this way, the ordered, or crystalline,
regions are gradually broken down, and a more complete solution is
achieved. The CS2, which is lost, reduces the solubility of the cellulose
and facilitates the regeneration of the cellulose after it is formed into a
ﬁlament.

(8)
Filtering
The viscose is ﬁltered to remove the undissolved materials, which might
either disrupt the spinning process or cause defects in the rayon ﬁlament.
(9)
Degassing
Bubbles of air entrapped in the viscose must be removed prior to
extrusion, or else, they cause voids, or weak spots, in the ﬁne rayon
ﬁlaments.
(10)
Spinning (Wet Spinning)
Production of Viscose Rayon Filament: The viscose solution is metered
through a spinneret into a spin bath containing sulfuric acid (to acidify the
sodium cellulose xanthate), sodium sulfate (to impart a high salt content
to the bath, which is useful in the rapid coagulation of viscose), and zinc
sulfate (for exchange with sodium xanthate to form zinc xanthate, to
cross-link the cellulose molecules). Once the cellulose xanthate is neu-
tralized and acidiﬁed, a rapid coagulation of the rayon ﬁlaments occurs,
followed by simultaneous stretching and decomposition of cellulose
xanthate to regenerated cellulose. The stretching and decomposition
processes are vital for obtaining the desired tenacity and other properties
of rayon. The slow regeneration of cellulose and stretching of rayon leads
to greater areas of crystallinity within the ﬁber, as is done with high-
tenacity rayon.
The dilute sulfuric acid decomposes the xanthate and regenerates cellu-
lose by wet spinning. The outer portion of the xanthate is decomposed in
the acid bath, forming a cellulose skin on the ﬁber. Sodium and zinc
sulfates control the rate of decomposition (of cellulose xanthate to cel-
lulose) and ﬁber formation.

Elongation-at-break is seen to decrease with increasing degree of crys-
tallinity and orientation of rayon.
(11)
Drawing
The rayon ﬁlaments are stretched, while the cellulose chains are still
relatively mobile. This causes the chains to stretch out and orient along
the ﬁber axis. As the chains become more parallel, the interchain
48
2
Precursors and Manufacturing of Carbon Fibers

hydrogen bonds form, providing the ﬁlaments with the properties nec-
essary for use as textile ﬁbers.
(12)
Washing
The freshly regenerated rayon contains many salts and other water sol-
uble impurities, which need to be removed. Several different washing
techniques may be used.
(13)
Cutting
If the rayon is to be used as staple (i.e., discreet lengths of ﬁber), the
group of ﬁlaments (termed “tow”) is passed through a rotary cutter to
yield a ﬁber, which can be processed analogously to cotton.
2. Currammonium rayon [88]
In this process, the ﬁbers are produced in a solution of cellulosic material in
cuprammonium hydroxide at a low temperature in nitrogen atmosphere, fol-
lowed by extruding through a spinneret into a sulfuric acid solution, necessary
to decompose the cuprammonium complex to cellulose. This is a relatively more
expensive process than that used for viscose rayon. However, the cross sections
of the resultant ﬁbers are almost round (Fig. 2.10).
3. Saponiﬁed cellulose acetate rayon [88, 89]
Rayon can be produced from cellulose acetate yarns through saponiﬁcation.
Puriﬁed cotton is steeped in glacial acetic acid to make it more reactive. It is
then acetylated with an excess of glacial acetic acid and acetic anhydride, fol-
lowed by sulfuric acid to promote the reaction. The cellulose triacetate formed
by acetylation is hydrolyzed to convert the triacetate to diacetate. The resultant
mixture is poured into water, which precipitates the cellulose acetate. For
spinning, it is dissolved in acetone, ﬁltered, deaerated, and extruded into hot air,
which evaporates the solvent. A high degree of orientation can be given to the
ﬁber by drawing because cellulose acetate is more plastic. Its ﬁber cross section
is nearly round, but lobed (Fig. 2.11).

Cellulosic Precursors
49

2.3.3 Manufacture of Carbon Fibers from Cellulosic
Precursors
Rayon ﬁbers, as mentioned above, can be converted into carbon ﬁbers with
chemical, physical, mechanical, and microstructural changes, through stabilization
and carbonization processes. With regard to chemical and mechanical properties,
the stabilization of the precursor ﬁbers is important to produce stable carbon ﬁbers
through the subsequent carbonization process. In particular, the thermal shrinkage
of the cellulose ﬁbers occurs owing to the weight reduction of ﬁbers during the
stabilization process [90]. Therefore, in this section, only the stabilization, car-
bonization, and graphitization of cellulosic precursors for manufacturing of carbon
ﬁbers will be described. Other processes such as surface treatment, sizing, and
winding are identical to the processing of the PAN-based carbon ﬁbers.
1. Stabilization
Cellulose is a glucose-based, linear polymer connected by β-(1-4) glycosidic
linkages (Fig. 2.12). The hydroxyl groups can easily form intra- and intermo-
lecular hydrogen bonds in the cellulose structure, and the hydrogen bonds can
lead
to
various
ordered
crystalline
arrangements.
From
the
molecular

stoichiometry of (C6H10O5)n, it was found that the theoretical carbon yield of
the carbonization process for the cellulosic structure is 44.4 %. However, the
actual carbon yield is only between 10 % and 30 %, resulting from the depo-
lymerization of the macromolecular chains and the elimination of carbon by
oxygen in the forms of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), alde-
hydes, organic acids, and tars. Therefore, the selection of suitable stabilizer
materials is essential for improving the carbon yield and properties of the
products in the carbonization process, which can lead to higher efﬁciency
[91–94].
The degradation of general cellulose ﬁbers under an inert atmosphere initiates at
200 °C and ends at around 380 °C. In addition, the thermal stability of the
cellulose sources depends on the process conditions for cellulose ﬁber pro-
duction. Although the physicochemical processes taking place during the
transformation of cellulose into carbon are complex, it is certain that the
depolymerization of the macromolecular chains produces a variety of oxygen-
ated compounds. This leads to the major mass loss of the solid residue through
the production of volatile substances. Various methods can help in reducing the
burning loss. One method involves the modiﬁcation of cellulose precursors to
improve the yield and properties of the carbon ﬁbers. The other method involves
the pyrolysis of the cellulose with slow heating rates of a few °C/h or the
treatment of cellulose ﬁbers with suitable impregnators [95, 96].
The pyrolysis of cellulose is mainly controlled by two predominant reactions,
dehydration and depolymerization (cleavage) (Fig. 2.12). The main reaction at
low temperatures (300 °C) is the dehydration reaction for the stabilization of the
cellulose structure. During the dehydration, the elimination of the hydroxyl
groups leads to conjugated double bonds, and subsequently, the dehydrated
cellulose ring becomes less accessible for cleavage compared to the original
cellulose structure in an aromatic form in the carbonization step. The polymeric
structure is basically retained through dehydration, and the weight loss at this
temperature range is usually owing to the evaporation of water. Depolymer-
ization in the early stages of pyrolysis with the incomplete dehydration of the
cellulose structure causes major mass loss at higher temperatures. Therefore, a
slow heating rate of a few °C/h can be used to increase the carbon yield of the
cellulose ﬁbers. In addition, the slow pyrolysis inﬂuences the properties of the
ﬁnal ﬁbers such as improved density, porosity, and microstructure, compared to
fast pyrolysis [97].

2. Carbonization and graphitization
As shown in Fig. 2.13, the ﬁrst H2O dehydration occurs between 25 and 150 °C
(Stage I), and the physical desorption of water and dehydration of the cellulosic
unit occur between 150 and 240 °C (Stage II). This leads to the formation of the
double-bonded intermediates [98]. Carbonization of cellulose refers to the
conversion process from this depolymerized structure into graphite-like layers
through repolymerization. The process begins at approximately 300 °C and
continues up to 900 °C, as shown in the Stages III and IV of Fig. 2.13. The basic
microstructure of the carbon is formed during the Stage III [82]. As shown in
Fig. 2.13, the thermal cleavage of the glycosidic linkage and the scission of ether
bonds occur over the range 240–400 °C. Moreover, depolymerization to
monosaccharide derivatives occurs during this stage of carbonization. Then,
these intermediates form aromatic structures, releasing gases containing non-
carbon atoms (O, H) [99]. The carbonaceous residue is converted into a more
ordered carbon structure through heat treatment between 400 and 900 °C under
an inert atmosphere. The full mechanism of aromatization related to the gra-
phitic products is still unknown, owing to the complex characterization of the
cellulose decomposition and existence of many competing reactions during the
different stages of carbonization.
The heat treatment up to 900 °C causes the formation of semiordered carbo-
naceous structures under an inert atmosphere. After this stage, the carbonized
ﬁbers can be treated with heat at higher temperatures to initiate graphitization. In
general, graphitization is carried out under stress at 900–3,000 °C to obtain
high-modulus ﬁbers through the development of an enhanced order of the
graphene stacks, both laterally between the layers (crystallographic register) and
in terms of the preferred orientation along the ﬁber axis. The Young’s modulus
is increased by the increasing treatment temperature, if the graphitization is
conducted under tension. After graphitization, the carbon content of the ﬁbers
usually increases to above 99 %, and the ﬁber density increases resulting from
the growth of crystallites [100].
2.4 Pitch Precursors
Pitches are complex blends of polyaromatic molecules and heterocyclic com-
pounds, which can be used as precursors of carbon ﬁbers or carbon ﬁllers in carbon
composites. These pitches can contain more than 80 % carbon, and the composition
of a pitch varies with the source tar and processing conditions [101]. In addition,
these pitches can be obtained from one of several sources mentioned below:
1. Petroleum reﬁning, normally called bitumen, or asphalt
2. Destructive distillation of coal
3. Natural asphalt, e.g., from Trinidad
4. Pyrolysis of PVC

As mentioned above, the natural pitches are produced by the reﬁning of petro-
leum and destructive distillation of coal, while the synthetic pitches are produced by
the pyrolysis of synthetic polymers. Generally, among the prepared pitches using
several sources, the petroleum pitch and coal pitch are widely used in the pro-
duction of carbon ﬁbers [102].
In terms of the components of pitch, Riggs et al. considered that the pitch is
composed of four main classes of chemical compounds [103].
1. Saturates: Low molecular weight aliphatic compounds
2. Naphthene aromatics: Low molecular weight aromatics and saturated ring
structures
3. Polar aromatics: Higher molecular weight and more heterocyclic in nature
4. Asphaltenes: Highest molecular weight fraction in pitch with the highest aro-
maticity and thermally most stable
The compositions of various oils and pitches are listed in Table 2.4. Several
researchers have conﬁrmed that the asphaltene-rich materials are the most suitable
for conversion into carbon ﬁbers.
2.4.1 Petroleum Pitch Precursors
Petroleum pitch can be obtained from various sources such as heavy residue
obtained from a catalytic cracking process and steam cracker tar—a by-product of
the steam cracking of naphtha or gas oils to produce ethylene or any residues from
crude oil distillation or reﬁning [104]. Many methods can be used for the pro-
duction of pitch and are based on an initial reﬁning process, which can include
either one method or combination of several treatment methods listed below:
1. Prolonged heat treatment to advance the molecular weight of the components
2. Air bowing at approximately 250 °C
3. Steam stripping and application of vacuum to remove low boiling components
4. Distillation

In common with the coal tar pitch, the chemical and physical characteristics of
petroleum pitch are dependent on the process and conditions employed, especially
the process temperature and heat treatment time. Generally, longer times and higher
temperatures produce pitches with increased aromaticity and higher anisotropic
contents. The petroleum pitches are usually less aromatic compared to the coal tar
pitch [105].
2.4.2 Coal Tar Pitch Precursors
Coal tar is a by-product of the coking of bituminous coals to produce cokes [106].
The metallurgical cokes are produced at high temperatures (between 900 and
1,100 °C), but it produces smokeless fuels at lower temperatures (approximately
600 °C). The low-temperature process affords a smaller amount of tar compared to
the high-temperature process. Coal tar pitch is obtained from the coal tar using
distillation and heat treatment processes. The pitch is the residue, which follows the
removal of the heavy (creosote or anthracene) oil fractions. The pitches are complex
mixtures containing many different individual organic compounds, and the precise
compositions and properties vary according to the source of the tar and method of
removal of low molecular weight fractions. Smith et al. [107] and Guigon et al.
[108] reported that roughly two-thirds of the compounds isolated hitherto from the
coal tar pitch are aromatic, and the rest are heterocyclic. Most of the compounds are
substituted with the methyl group. The majority of the coal tar pitch components
contain between three and six rings, having boiling points over the range
340–550 °C. Table 2.5 lists the major aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, which
have been quantitatively found in a typical coal tar pitch [106–109].
2.4.3 Preparation Methods of Pitch-Based Precursors
1. Preparation methods of petroleum pitch
Many petroleum products are referred to as “pitch” by the petroleum industry.
This could cause considerable confusion outside the reﬁning community. In
most cases, the different types of petroleum pitch exist as black solids at room
temperature. The individual characteristics of the petroleum pitches vary with
the functions of the feedstock and speciﬁc processes used in their manufacture.
Feedstock can range from being predominantly aliphatic to predominantly
aromatic-type chemical structures. A reaction step is used to generate and/or
concentrate the large molecules typically observed in petroleum pitch. The most
common processes used to generate petroleum pitches are either singular pro-
cesses or a combination of: (a) solvent deasphalting, (b) oxidation, and (c)
thermal processes [110].
2.4
Pitch Precursors
55

Solvent deasphalting is used to separate the fractions of various heavy oils. It
involves mixing the feedstock with a parafﬁnic solvent such as propane, butane,
or pentane. The mixing of the feedstock with these light parafﬁnic solvents
causes the precipitation of molecules with higher molecular weights and aro-
maticities. The chemical and physical properties of this type of petroleum pitch
are more closely associated with the asphalt cements used for paving roads.
Typical properties include speciﬁc gravity of approximately 1.0 g/cc at 60 °F,
with the chemical composition containing signiﬁcant amounts of nonaromatic
hydrocarbons and high levels of iron, nickel, and vanadium [111].
Various grades of pitch can be produced by the oxidation of heavy petroleum
hydrocarbons. Although oxygen is used in the process, the products typically do
not contain signiﬁcant amounts of oxygen. During this reaction, the presence of

oxygen is successful in generating free radicals, which induce the polymeriza-
tion reactions. The chemical properties of these products will depend upon the
starting material and degree of reaction, but the pitches produced typically have
low coking values and high viscosities [112].
Thermal processing is used to produce the petroleum pitch, as noted in several
patents. Thermal processing has traditionally been used to produce the high
speciﬁc gravity and aromatic petroleum pitches referred to in the introduction of
this chapter. The thermal processes typically employ heat treatment tempera-
tures over the range 300–480 °C. A typical schematic for producing the
petroleum pitch from crude oil using thermal processing is shown in Fig. 2.14.
2. Preparation methods of coal tar pitch
Coal tar is a by-product of the coking of coal, used to produce metallurgical
coke [113]. Coal is heated to approximately 1,100 °C in a coke oven to produce
coke (the primary product) and by-products such as coke oven gas, coal tar light
oil, and coal tar. The typical yields are 70 % solid products and 30 % liquid
products. The yield of coal tar, the feedstock for producing coal tar pitch, from a
ton of coal is 30–45 L (8–12 gallons). Coal tar pitch has several uses, but the
majority of the pitch produced is used as a binder for petroleum coke to produce

anodes and graphite electrodes [114]. Figure 2.15 shows the schematic for coal
tar pitch production. As indicated in the ﬁgure, the coal tar pitch is produced by
the distillation of coal tar.
Pitch as a precursor has the advantage of lower material cost, higher char yield,
and higher degree of orientation compared to those of PAN [115]. The graphitic
structure also affords pitch-based carbon ﬁbers, higher elastic modulus, and higher
thermal and electrical conductivity along the ﬁber direction [116]. However, the
processing cost (mainly pitch puriﬁcation, mesophase formation, and ﬁber spin-
ning) to achieve high-performance carbon ﬁbers is higher. The pitch from petro-
leum and coal tar is isotropic. By evaporating the low molecular weight fractions,
the isotropic pitch can be melt-spun into low-cost general purpose (GP) (low
strength and low modulus) carbon ﬁbers. To produce high-performance ﬁbers, an
expensive hot stretching process (explained in the following section) needs to be
applied. A more common method to produce high-performance carbon ﬁbers from
the pitch is to use an anisotropic pitch such as mesophase pitch [117].
1. Isotropic pitch
Isotropic pitches are used to make a GP grade of pitch carbon ﬁbers, which are
not graphitic and have poorer properties compared to the high-performance
Fig. 2.15 Schematic for the manufacturing process of coal tar pitch
58

grade (HP), which requires a special treatment process to convert the pitch to a
mesophase grade, i.e., an optically anisotropic and graphitic material. The iso-
tropic pitch has to be treated to generate a product suitable for melt spinning,
with low volatility and ﬁltered to remove the solid particles. A good starting
material would be Ashland 240, which has low quinoline content. The volatile
components can be effectively removed with a wiped ﬁlm evaporator, wherein a
thin ﬁlm of the molten pitch in the evaporator is continuously wiped over the
heating surface, exposing a fresh surface, thus permitting the efﬁcient removal
of some of the volatile components without overheating. Also, while the pitch is
molten, any solid impurities are removed by ﬁltration. These reﬁning processes
raise the softening point and avoid the formation of mesophase. Hence,
increasingly, pitches such as Ashland’s Aerocarb 60 and 70 can be used. The
preparations of isotropic pitches have been undertaken to make GP carbon ﬁbers
[118, 119].
2. Mesophase pitch
The mesophase pitches used for high-modulus carbon ﬁber production can be
formed either by the thermal polymerization of petroleum- or coal-tar-based
pitches, or the catalytic polymerization of pure compounds such as naphthalene.
The mesophase transformation results in an intermediate phase, formed between
400 and 550 °C, by the thermal treatment of aromatic hydrocarbons. During the
mesophase formation, domains of highly parallel, plate-like molecules form and
coalesce until 100 % anisotropic material may be obtained in due course. It has
been well established that when the mesophase pitch is carbonized, the mor-
phology of the pitch is the primary factor that determines the microstructure of
the resulting graphitic material [120, 121].
The typical methods used for the production of the mesophase pitch are listed
below:
(1) pyrolysis of isotropic pitch
(2) solvent extraction
(3) hydrogenation
(4) catalytic modiﬁcation
2.4.4 Manufacture of Carbon Fibers from Pitch-Based
Precursors
The production of carbon ﬁbers from pitch-based precursors proceeds in several
stages: production of precursor ﬁbers, stabilization of the precursor ﬁbers, car-
bonization of the stabilized precursor ﬁbers, and graphitization of the carbonized
precursor ﬁbers. The stabilization process is the most important stage during which
the thermal oxidation takes place in the precursor carbon ﬁbers. Only properly
stabilized precursor ﬁbers can assure satisfactory performance of the ﬁnal carbon
2.4

ﬁber product. Other processes such as surface treatment, sizing, and winding are
identical to the processing of PAN-based carbon ﬁbers.
The typical manufacturing steps for the production of carbon ﬁbers from pitch-
based precursors are listed below:
1. Production of precursor ﬁbers by melt spinning [122]
Melt spinning involves three steps: melting the precursor, extrusion through a
spinneret capillary, and drawing the ﬁbers as they cool. Many investigators have
concluded that this process is the primary source of structure in the mesophase
pitch-based carbon ﬁbers and that thermal treatment only reinforces this struc-
ture. The effects of melt spinning conditions on the structure and properties of
carbon ﬁbers will be discussed in this section.
Several process variables are important in determining the ﬁbers’ potential for
developing an ordered graphitic structure. The ﬁrst is melt temperature. Each
mesophase has a range of temperature over which the melt spinning is possible.
Spinning at temperatures below this range results in high viscosities and brittle
fracture during drawdown, while at temperatures above this range, thermal
degradation of the pitch and dripping owing to low viscosity occur. The vis-
cosities of all the mesophases are highly dependent upon temperature, as shown
in Fig. 2.16; therefore, the temperature range for successful melt spinning is
quite narrow. Using the AR mesophase, Mochida found that decreasing the melt
spinning temperature by even 15° resulted in a fourfold increase in viscosity
and, in turn, signiﬁcant decreases in the tensile strength and Young’s modulus.
It was, therefore, concluded that a low melt viscosity was necessary for the
production of high-quality carbon ﬁbers.
2. Stabilization of precursor ﬁbers
Analogous to the PAN precursor ﬁbers, the pitch ﬁbers are either infusibilized or
oxidized in air at elevated temperatures before being exposed to the ﬁnal high-

spinning process for
production of precursor ﬁbers
60

temperature carbonization treatment. The oxidization temperature should be
below the ﬁber softening point to keep the orientated structure. Depending on
the composition, the mesophase pitch precursor is stabilized in air at
250–350 °C for a duration ranging from 30 min to several hours. There has been
no consensus hitherto on the purpose of the ﬁber stretching in this step. The
oxidized pitch molecules contain ketone, carbonyl, and carboxyl groups, which
lead to the stronger hydrogen bonding between the adjacent molecules. The
introduction of oxygen containing groups and formation of hydrogen bonding
between the molecules facilitate the three dimensional cross-linking, but hinder
the growth of crystallites. Iodine has been used to reduce the stabilization time
and increase the carbon yield of carbon ﬁbers from the natural pitch. In a patent
by Sasaki and Sawaki [123], the pitch ﬁber was soaked in a methanol solution of
iodine till at least 0.05 wt. % of iodine was imbibed. The ﬁber was then heated
under an oxidizing atmosphere for infusibilization. The infusibilization time was
affected by the amount of imbibed iodine but generally could be completed
within approximately 10 min [123, 124].
3. Carbonization and graphitization of stabilized precursor ﬁbers
Stabilized ﬁbers are then carbonized and graphitized. The greatest weight loss
takes place in the early stages of carbonization. In order to avoid the defects
created by the excessive release of volatiles, the ﬁbers are precarbonized for a
brief period of 0.5–5 min at 700–900 °C. The carbon ﬁbers can be produced by
carbonizing the stabilized ﬁbers to 1,500–1,800 °C. Bright and Singer [125]
reported that because of the degradation of the structure, the modulus decreased
at temperatures up to approximately 1,000 °C, but increased signiﬁcantly upon
further increase in temperature. The carbon ﬁbers can be graphitized at tem-
peratures close to 3,000 °C for enhanced Young’s modulus. Barr et al. [126]
have shown that increasing the heat treatment temperature could increase the
preferred alignment of the crystalline lamellae.
Although graphite layers are aligned along the ﬁber axis, the transverse struc-
tures of the carbon ﬁbers can be different. The velocity gradients orient the
layers radially, circumferentially, or randomly. It has been reported that a radial
crack can form in the mesophase carbon ﬁbers with layer planes distributed
radially. The alignments in the precursor ﬁber are retained in the resultant
carbon ﬁber. Therefore, carbon ﬁber strength could be improved by adjusting
the microstructure in the precursor ﬁber. Research has shown that the ﬂaw
sensitivity of mesophase carbon ﬁbers is reduced by varying the microstructure
of the pitch precursor ﬁbers. The microstructure can be modiﬁed by changing
the ﬂow proﬁles during melt spinning. A radial cross section is usually formed
through the laminar ﬂow of the pitch melt. Petoca Oil Company has employed
agitation in the spinneret to impart a randomized distribution for the folded
graphene layer planes in the transverse direction. The agitation created a tur-
bulent ﬂow and the resultant carbon ﬁbers showed increased tensile strength.
The turbulent ﬂow can also be obtained by different die designs because the ﬂow
behavior heavily depends on the shape of the spinneret. Spinnerets containing
2.4
Pitch Precursors
61

sections with different diameters have shown to be able to change the ﬁber
microstructure. Because melt ﬂow is dependent on melt viscosity, the change in
the microstructure can also be obtained simply by changing the spinning tem-
perature. Otani and Oya [127] have shown that when the spinning temperature
was raised to above 349 °C, the radial structure changed to either a random type
or radial type, surrounded by an onion-skin-type structure.
2.5 Other Forms of Precursors
Many other polymers have also been investigated for their potential as carbon ﬁber
precursors [128–137]. In addition to the cellulosic ﬁbers discussed earlier, other
natural ﬁbers have been investigated and considered as the precursors for carbon
ﬁbers such as silk, chitosan, and eucalyptus [128–136]. They can lower the pro-
duction cost; however, most of them are used for GP carbon ﬁbers, which do not
afford strong mechanical properties.
In addition, many linear and cyclic polymers have been investigated as a pre-
cursor for the production of carbon ﬁbers, including phenolic polymers, polyace-
nephthalene,
polyamide,
polyphenylene,
poly-p-phenylene
benzobisthiazole
(PBBT), polybenzoxazole, polybenzimidazole, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylidene
chloride, and polystyrene. Linear precursors require heat stretching to obtain high-
performance carbon ﬁbers, and their carbon yields are usually extremely low [137].
The polymers with high aromatic content can generally offer a high carbon yield
and in some cases easy stabilization. However, these polymers either have high
costs or do not produce high-performance carbon ﬁbers. Further research needs to
be conducted to reduce the processing cost while improving the mechanical
properties of the resultant carbon ﬁbers.
2.6 Summary
In this chapter, we have given a brief overview of the precursors and manufacturing
of carbon ﬁbers. Among the precursors used for the production of carbon ﬁbers,
PAN-based and pitch-based precursors are the most important. A signiﬁcant amount
of work has been done on relating the ﬁber structure to the properties and translating
that relationship into production for either reducing cost or increasing ﬁber prop-
erties. However, challenges, including cost reduction, improvement in tensile and
compressive strength, and alternative precursor development, still remain.
Many polymers such as linear and cyclic polymers have been evaluated as low-
cost carbon ﬁber precursor materials. It will open the door for low-cost carbon
ﬁbers. However, more research needs to be conducted to optimize the processing
conditions to enhance the mechanical properties and carbon yield of the resultant
carbon ﬁbers.

Matrices for Carbon Fiber Composites
Soo-Jin Park and Fan-Long Jin
Abstract Carbon ﬁbers have become an important reinforcing material in
advanced composites because of its extremely high strength, stiffness, heat resis-
tance, and light weight. Fiber-reinforced polymer composites have gained sub-
stantial interest owing to their very high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight
ratios and are widely used in aerospace, engineering, marine, and automobile
industries. In this chapter, we will present the various matrices and their charac-
terization for carbon ﬁber composites. It is described as classiﬁcation into two types
of thermosetting resins and thermoplastic resins.
3.1 Thermosetting Resins
3.1.1 Introduction
Thermosetting resins are polymer materials, which cure irreversibly, generally
found in the liquid form. The cure may be effected by heat [e.g., cyanate ester (CE)
resins], chemical reaction (e.g., epoxy resins), and irradiation (e.g., vinyl ester
resins) such as an infrared, ultraviolet light, or electron beam. Once cured, the
material cannot be reheated and melted back to its original liquid form.
Thermosetting resins are easy to process and laminate, do not necessarily need
either pressure or heat to form, generally inexpensive, stronger than thermoplastics,
and better suited for higher temperatures compared to thermoplastics. However,
they are relatively more brittle.

Carbon ﬁber (CF) has become an important reinforcing material in advanced
composites because of its extremely high strength, stiffness, heat resistance, and
light weight. Fiber-reinforced polymer composites have gained substantial interest
owing to their very high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios and are
widely used in aerospace, engineering, marine, and automobile industries.
Among the thermosetting resins, CE, epoxy, phenolic, polyester, polyimide, and
vinyl ester resins can be used as polymer matrices for CF-reinforced polymer
composites [1–12].
3.1.2 Cyanate Ester Resins
CE resins belong to a class of high-performance thermosetting resins and contain at
least two cyanate functional groups [13, 14]. Most commercial monomers can be
represented by the structural model illustrated in Fig. 3.1.
CE resins can be cured by heating alone, either at elevated or lower temperatures
in the presence of a suitable catalyst. The most common catalysts are transition
metal complexes such as cobalt, copper, manganese, and zinc complexes. The
chemistry of the cure reaction for CE resins involves the trimerization of three CN
groups to form a triazine ring. The CE resins have two cyanate groups, which
resulted in a three-dimensional polymer network structure, as shown in Fig. 3.2
[15].
CE resins will homopolymerize into a thermosetting material suitable for use in
high-performance composites such as printed circuit boards, structural composites,
and radomes. These resins have good processability, shelf-life, and compatibility
with a variety of reinforcements.
CEs are a family of high-temperature thermosetting resins, which bridge the gap
in the thermal performance between the engineering epoxy resins and high-tem-
perature polyimides. In addition to their outstanding thermal performance, CE resins
have several desirable characteristics, which justify their higher costs in many
applications. CEs possess a unique balance of properties and are particularly notable
for their low dielectric constant and dielectric loss, low moisture absorption, low
shrinkage, and low outgassing characteristics. They can be used in high-performance
adhesives, syntactic foams, honeycombs, and ﬁber-reinforced composites. They are
often found in blends with other thermosetting resins such as epoxy, bismaleimide,
and engineering thermoplastics [16, 17].

Fully cured bisphenol-E CE has glass transition temperature (Tg) and decom-
position temperature (Td), at 5 wt% loss, of 274 and 438 °C, respectively [18, 19].
Marieta et al. [14] studied the effect of surface treatment on the interfacial shear
strength (IFSS) of bisphenol-A dicyanate (DCBA)/PAN-based CF composites.
Figure 3.3 shows the apparent IFSS values of the composites with different treat-
ments. The results indicated that the commercial sizing of epoxy was found to be
effective in promoting adhesion because of the chemical reactions between epoxy
sizing and DCBA during the curing process.

3.1.3 Epoxy Resins
Epoxy resins are molecules containing more than one epoxide group, as shown
below:
Epoxy resins are thermosetting polymers, which can be cured with a wide
variety of curing agents via curing reactions. Epoxy resins have a wide range of
applications, including ﬁber-reinforced materials, general-purpose adhesives, high-
performance coatings, and encapsulating materials [20–26].
3.1.3.1 Bisphenol-A/F Epoxy Resins
Diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) is produced by reacting epichlorohydrin
with bisphenol-A in the presence of a basic catalyst. Figure 3.4 depicts the chemical
structure of DGEBA.
The properties of the DGEBA resins depend on the value of n, which is the
number of repeating units commonly known as degree of polymerization. Low-
molecular-weight molecules tend to be liquids, while higher molecular weight
molecules tend to be either viscous liquids or solids. DGEBA has been used
commercially as a raw material and is the primary chemical building block for a
broad spectrum of materials [27, 28].

Diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-F (DGEBF) is synthesized by reacting epichlo-
rohydrin with bisphenol-F in the presence of a basic catalyst. Figure 3.5 shows the
chemical structure of DGEBF.
DGEBF epoxy resins have low viscosity and are widely used in solvent-free
coatings, concrete reinforcements, adhesives, electrical insulation, and ﬁlament
winding. The cured DGEBF epoxy resins provide improved resistance performance
against solvents compared to that of DGEBA epoxy resins [29].
Diglycidyl ether of tetrabromobisphenol-A is prepared by reacting epichloro-
hydrin with tetrabromobisphenol-A in the presence of a catalyst. Figure 3.6 shows
the chemical structure of the diglycidyl ether of tetrabromobisphenol-A.
Diglycidyl ether of tetrabromobisphenol-A with high Tg, heat resistance, good
operation performance, ﬁre resistance, and low moisture absorbance can be used in
glass ﬁber laminates [30].
Park et al. [31] demonstrated the effect of ﬁber–polymer interactions on the
fracture toughness behavior of CF-reinforced DGEBA epoxy matrix composites.
Figure 3.7 shows the evolution of critical stress intensity factor (KIC) of DGEBA/
CF composites as a function of the electric current density. The KIC of the com-
posites continually increases with increasing current densities of the treatments up
to 0.4 A/m2, owing to the increased interfacial adhesion between the ﬁbers and
matrix.

3.1.3.2 Cycloaliphatic Epoxy Resins
A cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, 3′,4′-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexan-
ecarboxylate, is synthesized by the reaction of 3′-cyclohexenylmethyl-3-cycloh-
exenecarboxylate with peracetic acid, as shown in Fig. 3.8.
The cycloaliphatic epoxy resin has an aliphatic backbone and fully saturated
molecular structure, which shows excellent UV stability, good weatherability, and
excellent electrical properties. The epoxy resin containing high epoxide content
exhibits high cross-link density, Tg, and heat distortion temperature (HDT), which
is used to fabricate structural components subjected to high temperatures. The
epoxy resin containing short chains possesses low viscosity, which allows for the
rapid ﬁber wet-out in commonly used processes, including ﬁlament winding, pul-
trusion, and resin transfer molding [32].
3.1.3.3 Trifunctional Epoxy Resins
A trifunctional epoxy resin, trimethylol propane-N-triglycidyl ether, is prepared by
the reaction of trimethylol propane with epichlorohydrin, as shown in Fig. 3.9.
The epoxy resin has low viscosity, low temperature curing, noncrystallinity, and
plasticity [33, 34].
3.1.3.4 Tetrafunctional Epoxy Resins
Tetrafunctional epoxy resins are synthesized through the reaction of 1,3-diamino-
benzene or 4,4′-aminodiphenyl methane with epichlorohydrin as shown in Fig. 3.10.
Tetrafunctional epoxy resins with a large number of epoxy functionalities have
high cross-linking densities, which are used in applications involving high tem-
perature resistance. The cured epoxy resins show excellent chemical resistance,
high modulus, UV-blocking effect, and thermal stability [35, 36].

Chen et al. [18] studied the DGEBA/CF and 4,4′-tetradiglycidy diaminodiphenol
methane (TGDDM)/CF ﬁlament wound composites. Table 3.1 lists the mechanical
properties of the composites. It was observed that the two types of resins (DGEBA
and TGDDM) containing either 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl methane (DDM) or DDM/
diethyltoluene diamine (DETDA) as the hardener showed stronger tensile proper-
ties than those containing methyltetrahydrophthalic anhydride (MeTHPA) as the
hardener. The TGDDM resin casts showed tensile strengths close to those of the
DGEBA resin casts but with higher elongations.
3.1.3.5 Novolac Resins
Novolac resins are synthesized by reaction of a molar excess of phenol with
formaldehyde in the presence of an acidic catalyst such as oxalic acid, hydrochloric
acid, or sulfonate acid. Figure 3.11 shows the chemical structure of novolac resins.
Novolac resins are solids at room temperature, and soften and ﬂow between 65
and 105 °C. The number average molecular weight (Mn) of a standard phenol
novolac resin is between 250 and 900. Novolac resins are soluble in many polar
organic solvents such as alcohols and acetone, but not in water [38].

3.1.3.6 Novolac Epoxy Resins
Novolac epoxy resins are glycidyl ethers of phenolic novolac resins, which are
synthesized by reacting phenolic novolac resin with epichlorohydrin. Figure 3.12
shows the chemical structure of novolac epoxy resins. Because an additional curing
agent is required to complete the resin’s cure, the industry commonly refers to
novolac resins as “two-step” products.
The multiple epoxide groups in the novolac epoxy resins allow them to achieve
high cross-linking density, thereby resulting in excellent resistance against temper-
ature, chemicals, and solvents. Novolac epoxy resins are widely used to formulate
the molding compounds for microelectronics packaging because of their superior
performance at elevated temperatures, excellent moldability and mechanical prop-
erties, superior electrical properties, and heat and humidity resistance [39, 40].
3.1.3.7 Epoxy Diluents
The addition of epoxy diluents can reduce the viscosity of epoxy resins. The
addition of reactive diluents might change the surface tension, reactivity, solvent
resistance, physical strength, linear coefﬁcient of expansion, ﬂexibility/impact
resistance, and abrasion resistance.
Epoxy diluents can be divided into nonreactive diluents and reactive diluents.
Some examples of nonreactive diluents include benzylalcohol, dibutylphthalate,
hydrocarbon resins, and pine oil. Some examples of reactive diluents include o-
cresyl glycidyl ether (EEW: 180 g/eq, viscosity: 7 mPa s at 25 °C), hexanediol
diglycidyl ether (EEW: 142 g/eq, viscosity: 14 mPa s at 25 °C), and C12–C14 alkyl
glycidyl ether (EEW: 280 g/eq, viscosity: 7 mPa s at 25 °C) [41, 42]. Figure 3.13

3.1.3.8 Epoxy Curing Agents
For the curing of epoxy resins, a wide variety of curing agents such as amines,
polyamides, phenolic resins, anhydrides, isocyanates, polymercaptans, and catalytic
curing agents have been used. The cure kinetics and Tg of cured epoxy resins are
dependent on the molecular structures of the curing agents. The stoichiometry of the

epoxy/curing agent system also affects the properties of the cured epoxy resins.
Employing different types and amounts of the curing agent determines the ﬁnal
network structure.
An agent which does not participate in the reaction is known as a catalytic curing
agent. A reactive curing agent is generally used in much greater amounts compared
to a catalytic curing agent. Also, it actually participates in the reaction. The curing
agents are reacted with molecules and coupled directly into the cured system as a
structural member of the polymer.
Epoxy curing agents can be divided into amine-type curing agents (triethyl-
enetetramine and DDM), alkali curing agents (imidazole and tertiary amine),
anhydrides [phthalic anhydride (PA) and nadic methyl anhydride], and catalytic
curing agents [N-benzylpyrazinium hexaﬂuoroantimonate (BPH) and N-benzyl-
quinoxalinium hexaﬂuoroantimonate (BQH)] [43–46]. The chemical structures of
DDM, PA, BPH, and BQH are shown in Fig. 3.14.
3.1.3.9 Curing Process
Epoxy curing process is a chemical reaction in which the epoxide groups in the
epoxy resins react with a curing agent to form a highly cross-linked, three-
dimensional network [47, 48].
1. Room temperature cure
Epoxy resin cures with room temperature curing agent (such as aliphatic
polyamine) at room temperature. A room temperature cure will provide lower
Tg, higher ﬂexibility, impact resistance, and electrical and thermal shock
resistance.
2. Heat cure
Generally, epoxy resins are cured with the curing agent at elevated temperatures,
and the resulting cured epoxy resins yield higher glass transition temperature,
tensile strength, heat resistance, and chemical resistance.

3. Photocure
Epoxy resins are cured using photoinitiators via an addition cure reaction in the
presence of an infrared, ultraviolet light, or electron beam.
3.1.3.10 Curing Mechanism
1. Amine-based curing agents
Primary and secondary amines react through nucleophilic addition to the
epoxide ring, as shown in Fig. 3.15. The reaction is exothermic. Proton donors
such as tertiary amines are generally used as catalysts to accelerate the curing
process with amines. The use of an excessive amount of catalyst achieves faster
curing, but usually at the expense of the active lifespan and thermal stability
[49].
2. Anhydride-based curing agents
Figure 3.16 shows the cure reaction mechanism of the epoxide with anhydrides.
First, the anhydride reacts with the pendant hydroxyl groups in epoxy resins to
produce ester acids, and then, the carboxyl groups react with the epoxide groups

to yield ester groups. The reaction with the anhydrides is usually catalyzed by
tertiary amines and initiated by the activation of the anhydride with amine. Thus,
the cure reaction is initiated at a relatively low temperature in the presence of
tertiary amines [44, 50].
3. Catalytic curing agents
Figure 3.17 shows the suggested mechanism of the polymerization of BPH-
initiated epoxides. The BPH thermally decomposed to generate a benzyl cat-
ionic initiating species. In the initial propagation step (Fig. 3.17a), the epoxide
group attacked a propagating cationic species. The reaction of the OH group
with BPH generated a powerful protic acid (H+SbF6−) (Fig. 3.17b). The
propagation then continued through a subsequent attack on the epoxide groups,
an alcohol attack, and proton transfer reactions (Fig. 3.17c). Also, the protic acid
subsequently can attack the epoxide groups in the propagation step. Once the
monomer concentration decreased, a pyrazine released from the salts can pos-
sibly attack, perhaps predominantly, the propagation species, thereby termi-
nating the polymerization, as shown in Fig. 3.17d [51–54].

3.1.4 Phenolic Resins
Phenolic resins are normally prepared from phenol and formaldehyde. On the basis
of the preparation methods, phenolic resins can be divided into resol and novolac
resins [55–60].
3.1.4.1 Resol Resins
Resol resins are synthesized by the reaction of a molar excess of formaldehyde with
phenol in the presence of a basic catalyst. Figure 3.18 shows the chemical structure
of resol resins.
When an excess of formaldehyde is used in the synthesis of resol resins, a
sufﬁcient number of methylol and dibenzyl ether groups remain reactive to

complete the polymerization and cure the resin without the incorporation of a cure
agent such as hexamethylenetetramine. For this reason, the industry commonly
refers to the resol resins as “single-stage”-type products. The typical Mn of a
straight phenol resol resin is between 200 and 450.
3.1.4.2 Novolac Resins
Novolac resins are synthesized by the reaction of a molar excess of phenol with
formaldehyde in the presence of an acidic catalyst. Figure 3.19 shows the chemical
structure of novolac resins.
The reaction creates a methylene bridge at either the ortho or para position of the
phenolic aromatic rings. The ﬁnal phenolic resins are unable to react further without
the addition of a curing agent. Because an additional agent is required to complete
the curing of the resin, the industry commonly refers to novolac resins as “two-
stage”
products.
The
most
common
curing
agent
for

is
hexamethylenetetramine.
Park et al. [56] demonstrated the interfacial characteristics and fracture toughness
of the electrolytically Ni-plated CF-reinforced phenolic resin composites. Fig-
ure 3.20 shows the results of the KIC tests of the composites as a function of the
current density. The KIC increased with the increasing current density up to 10 A/m2,
owing to the presence of nickelized functional groups and increased number of oxide
functional groups on the CF.
He et al. [61] studied the effects of novolac resin modiﬁcation on the mechanical
properties of the epoxy/CF composites. Figure 3.21 shows the Charpy impact
strength of the unmodiﬁed and modiﬁed composites on varying the content of the
novolac resin. It was observed that on increasing the content of the novolac resin
from 0 to 18 wt%, the impact strength ﬁrst gradually increased and then decreased.
The impact strength reached the maximum at 13 wt% of the novolac resin. The
increased impact properties in epoxy/novolac resin/CF composites might be owing
to the novolac resin transition layer, which was bonded to the CF surface and matrix.

3.1.5 Polyester Resins
Polyester resins are unsaturated resins formed by the reaction of dibasic organic
acids and polyhydric alcohols, as shown in Fig. 3.22.
Polyester resins have relatively good ultraviolet resistance, are long lasting, and
show strong resistance to water. These resins are the most commonly used matrix in
the marine and composite industries. The resins are used in sheet molding and bulk
molding compounds and toners of laser printers. They are commonly used for auto
repairs, casting, adhesives, and wood ﬁlling. These resins can be used with any type
of ﬁberglass: CF or kevlar [61–65].
Polyester resins are classiﬁed as thermosetting resins and will cure exothermi-
cally to a solid when the curing agent is added. Generally, organic peroxides such
as benzoyl peroxide and methyl ethyl ketone peroxide are used as the curing agents.

Matrices for Carbon Fiber Composites

Polyester resins are the most widely used resins in the composites industry. The
resins are less expensive and more forgiving than the epoxy resins and offer cor-
rosion resistance. The majority of all ﬁberglass parts are constructed using polyester
resins because they are easy to use, fast curing, and resistance of the extremes of
temperature and catalysts.
Some examples of commercially important linear polyesters are polyglycolic
acid (PGA), polylactic acid (PLA), polycaprolactone (PCL), polyethylene tere-
phthalate (PET), and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT).
PGA is prepared through the ring-opening polymerization of glycolide, as
shown in Fig. 3.23.
PLA is synthesized through the ring-opening polymerization of lactide, as shown
in Fig. 3.24.
PCL is prepared through the ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone
using stannous octoate as a catalyst, as shown in Fig. 3.25.
PET is produced through the polycondensation of ethylene glycol and either
dimethyl terephthalate or terephthalic acid. An excess ethylene glycol is reacted
with the former in the melt in the presence of a basic catalyst, as shown in Fig. 3.26.

In the process involving terephthalic acid, the esteriﬁcation of ethylene glycol
and terephthalic acid is directly conducted at moderate pressure and high temper-
ature, as shown in Fig. 3.27.
PBT is prepared through the polycondensation of terephthalic acid with 1,4-
butanediol. Figure 3.28 shows the chemical structure of PBT.
Vilčáková et al. [66] demonstrated the electrical conductivities of polyester
resin/CF composites in the percolation threshold region. Table 3.2 shows the
average values of conductivity of the composites at laboratory temperature. A steep
conductivity increase at a relatively low CF content (0.7 vol.%) appeared, which
was due to a special mechanism involved in the formation of the intrinsic ﬁbrous
structure of the composites.
3.1.6 Polyimide Resins
Polyimide (PI) is a polymer of imide monomers. Figure 3.29 shows the structure of
PI [67–69].
On the basis of the composition of the main chain, the PIs can be divided into
aliphatic PI, wherein the atoms of the imide group are part of a linear chain, and
aromatic PI, wherein the imide group is part of a cyclic unit in the polymer chain, as
shown in Fig. 3.30.
PI possesses a greater resistance to heat compared to any other unﬁlled organic
material. Unlike most plastics, the PIs are available in laminates, molded parts, and
stock shapes. PI parts are fabricated using techniques ranging from powder met-
allurgy to conventional injection, transfer, and compression molding, and extrusion.

PIs possess low dielectric constant, ﬂexibility, polishability to angstrom-level
surface ﬁnishes, excellent dimensional stability, low water absorption, high tem-
perature stability, excellent machinability, low outgassing and noncontaminating
quality, exceptional mechanical strength, and low coefﬁcient of thermal expansion.
Consequently, PIs are used in place of metals and glass in many high-performance
applications in the electronics, automotive, and even the aerospace industries.

PIs are solid, heat-resistant, incombustible substances having predominantly
amorphous structures, with Mn of 50,000–150,000 and density of 1.35–1.48 g/cm3
at 20 °C. Most PIs do not dissolve in organic solvents, are inert to the action of oils,
and remain virtually unchanged under the action of dilute acids. However, they are
hydrolyzed by alkalis and superheated steam. PIs are resistant to ozone, γ-rays, and
fast electrons and neutrons, and resistant to heat.
Aromatic PIs with imide rings in the main chain have acquired practical sig-
niﬁcance because of their valuable physicochemical properties, which remain
unchanged for long periods over a wide range of temperature (ranging from −270 to
300 °C). The most industrially valuable PI is polypyromellitimide, prepared
through the –diamine route, as shown in Fig. 3.31. The PI melts above 600 °C and
exhibits thermal stability up to 500 °C in an inert atmosphere [70–73].
Li et al. [74] studied the friction and wear properties of surface-treated CF-
reinforced PI composites under oil-lubricated conditions. As shown in Fig. 3.32, the
friction coefﬁcients of air-oxidized and rare-earth-solution-treated CF-reinforced PI
composites are lower compared to those of untreated CF-reinforced PI composites,
thereby indicating that the surface modiﬁcation can improve the interfacial adhesion
and compatibility between the CF and PI matrix.

3.1.7 Vinyl Ester Resins
Vinyl ester (VE) is a resin produced by the esteriﬁcation of an epoxy resin with an
unsaturated monocarboxylic acid, thereby combining the advantages of epoxy and
polyester resins. The resins possess higher ﬂexibility, analogous to the epoxy resins,
and ease of processing, analogous to the polyesters [75].
VE resins are stronger than the polyester resins and cheaper than the epoxy
resins. Vinyl ester has lower viscosity compared to the polyester and epoxy resins.
VE resins offer better resistance to moisture absorption compared to the polyester
resins. It is also known that vinyl ester resins bond well with ﬁberglass, but weakly
so with kevlar and CF owing to the nature of their exotic ﬁbers [76].
Bisphenol-A epoxy-VE resin, as shown in Fig. 3.33, is based on bisphenol-A
epoxy resin and provides resistance to a wide range of acids, alkalis, bleaches, and
organic compounds for use in several chemical processing industry applications.
VE resins are exceptionally reactive and cure rapidly. Peroxides such as methyl
ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP), dicumyl peroxide, di(t-butylperoxy) cyclohexane,
and t-butyl peroxybenzoate have been used as initiators for curing VE systems [77].
Cured VE is more ﬂexible and possesses greater toughness compared to the
polyester. VE can also withstand temperatures of up to approximately 200 °C
without distortion.
Yamada et al. [78] demonstrated the plasma-graft polymerization of a monomer
with double bonds onto the surface of CF and its adhesion to a VE resin. Fig-
ure 3.34 shows the pull-out force of yarns, which were grafted using poly(adipic
acid divinyl ester) (AADE) chains and later embedded in the cured VE resin/

benzoyl peroxide/N,N-dimethylaniline mixture, as a function of the degree of
grafting. The pull-out force increased with the increasing degree of grafting. The
degree of grafting was proportional to the number of graft chains formed on the
surface of the yarn because the average molecular weight of the graft chains did not
depend on the degree of grafting.
3.2 Thermoplastic Resins
3.2.1 Introduction
Thermoplastic resins consist of long polymer molecules, which are generally not
cross-linked. The resin can be repeatedly melted and reused. Usually, no chemical
change occurs when thermoplastic is cured.
Thermoplastic resins are often supplied as granules and heated to permit fabri-
cation using conventional molding methods such as injection molding, rotational
molding, extrusion, vacuum forming, and compression molding.
Thermoplastic resins have high impact strength, recyclability, and zero emis-
sions. They can bond to other thermoplastics and be molded or shaped with reheat.
Among the thermoplastic resins, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), poly-
amide, polycarbonate (PC), polyetheretherketone (PEEK), polyetherimide (PEI),
polyethersulfone, polyethylene (PE), polyphenylene sulﬁde, and polypropylene
(PP) resins can be used as polymer matrices for CF-reinforced polymer composites
[79–81].
3.2.2 Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene Resins
ABS is a terpolymer of acrylonitrile, butadiene, and styrene. Figure 3.35 shows the
chemical structure of ABS. Many industrial methods such as bulk, bulk-suspension,
emulsion, and emulsion graft-doped legitimate are used to prepare the ABS resins.
The typical compositions contain 50 % styrene and the remaining 50 % con-
sisting of butadiene and acrylonitrile. The higher the content of acrylonitrile, the
better the heat resistance, rigidity and solvent resistance; however, the worse the
ﬂow character. Its heat resistance and solvent resistance are better compared to
those of the high-impact polystyrene (HIPS). The impact strength, tensile strength,
and surface hardness of ABS are better compared to those HIPS. ABS resin is

tough, light, economic, heat- and stain-resistant, and an excellent engineering
plastic [82, 83].
ABS materials can be processed using any of the standard thermoplastic pro-
cessing methods. ABS resins have a relative density of 1.03–1.07, Izod impact
strength of 186.2–215.8 J/m, tensile strength of 34.3–49 MPa, and Rockwell
hardness of 62–118 [84].
ABS resins are widely used in ﬁelds such as automotive and electrical/electronic
applications, housing, business equipment, and computer components.
Li et al. [83] studied the CF surface treatment and addition of PA6 on the tensile
properties of ABS composites. Figure 3.36 shows the effects of the shot carbon ﬁber
(SCF) content on the tensile properties of ABS/SCF composites. Increasing the
SCF content increased the tensile strength and modulus of the composites, in
agreement with the well-known equation of Kelly and Tyson for mixing short ﬁber-
reinforced composite materials.
3.2.3 Polyamide Resins
Polyamide (PA) is a polymer containing amide monomers joined by peptide bonds.
PAs possess the CONH functional groups in the polymer backbone. They can be
produced either by the interaction between an amine (NH2) group and a carboxyl
(COOH) group, or the polymerization of amino acids or amino-acid derivatives.
PAs can occur both naturally and artiﬁcially. They are commonly used in textiles,
automotives, carpets, and sportswear owing to their extreme durability and strength
[85–87].
On the basis of the composition of the main chain, PAs are classiﬁed as aliphatic
PAs, polyphthalamides, and aromatic PAs. On the basis of the number and types of
repeating units, polyamides can be divided into homopolymers (PA 66, made from
hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid) and copolymers (PA 6/66, made from
caprolactam, hexamethylenediamine, and adipic acid). On the basis of their crys-
tallinity, polyamides can be divided into semicrystalline and amorphous.

Poly(hexamethylenediamine adipamide) (Nylon 66, PA66) is one of the most
widely used semicrystalline engineering thermoplastic resins. Nylon 66 is synthe-
sized by reacting adipic acid with hexamethylene diamine, as shown in Fig. 3.37
[88, 89].
Nylon 66 is a semicrystalline polyamide, commonly used in ﬁber applications
such as carpeting, clothing, and tire cords. It is also used as an engineering material
in bearings and gears owing to its good abrasion resistance and self-lubricating
properties [90]. Nylon 66 has good sliding properties, abrasion resistance, high
tensile strength and melting point, and electrical insulation. It is widely used as gear
wheels, friction strips, piston guides, impact plates, cam disks, etc. [91].
Nylon 66 has a melting point of 265 °C, which is high for a synthetic ﬁber,
though not comparable to either polyesters or aramids such as Kevlar. Its long
molecular chain results in more sites for hydrogen bonds, thereby creating chemical
“springs,” and making it very resilient.
The molten Nylon 66 undergoes a spinning process, wherein Nylon 66 is
extruded and sent through a spinneret, which is a small metal plate with ﬁne holes.
Nylon 66 is then air-cooled to form a wide range of ﬁber types.
Botelho et al. [86] studied the mechanical behavior of CF-reinforced PA com-
posites. Table 3.3 shows the tensile and compression properties of Nylon 66/CF
composites. An increase in the ﬁber volume fraction improved the mechanical
properties of the composites.

PC resins are a particular group of thermoplastic polymers. PC is a novel, highly
ﬂexible, durable and nonbreakable, and cost-effective means of domestic and
industrial usage. PC possesses high impact strength and exceptional clarity and is
widely used in applications such as bulletproof windows, break-resistant lenses, and
compact discs [92, 93].
PCs are used mainly as molding compounds. The commercially important PCs
use bisphenol-A and diphenyl carbonate. These polymers are clear plastics with a
slight yellow coloration. They have excellent electrical properties and high impact
strength.
PCs are easily worked, molded, and thermoformed. The plastics are widely used
in the modern chemical industry. A balance of useful features, including temper-
ature resistance, impact resistance, and optical properties, position the PCs between
commodity plastics and engineering plastics [94].
Choi et al. [95] demonstrated the production and characterization of PC com-
posite sheets reinforced with vapor grown carbon ﬁber (VGCF). Figure 3.39 shows
the Young’s modulus of PC/VGCF cast and rolling composites reinforced with
various amounts of VGCF. The Young’s modulus of both the composites increased
with the increasing VGCF content.

disodium salt of hydroquinone, which is generated in situ by deprotonation with
sodium carbonate, is shown in Fig. 3.40 [96].
PEEK is a semicrystalline thermoplastic with excellent mechanical and chemical
resistance properties, which are retained at high temperatures. The Young’s mod-
ulus is 3.6 GPa, while its tensile strength is over the range 90–100 MPa. PEEK has
a Tg of approximately 143 °C and melts at approximately 343 °C. PEEK carries a
V-0 ﬂammability rating and exhibits low smoke and toxic gas emissions when
exposed to ﬂame. PEEK has excellent chemical resistance, low moisture absorp-
tion, inherently good wear, and abrasion resistance and remains unaffected by
continuous exposure to either hot water or steam [97].
PEEK is generally used as an engineering material because it has high strength,
low wear, and good resistance to corrosion and operates effectively in an ultrahigh
vacuum environment [98, 99].
Gebhard et al. [100] studied the wear of aqueous lubricated short carbon ﬁber
(SCF)-reinforced PEEK composites. Figure 3.41 shows the ﬁber corrosion depths
of the composites under different experimental and environmental conditions. The
ﬁber corrosion depth of TGC (after a sliding experiment with simultaneous galvanic
corrosion) showed the highest value in this study. This means that there is not only
an increase in the wear rate owing to the occurrence of ﬁber corrosion, but also a
supplementary effect of the tribological stress-enhanced CF corrosion.

3.2.6 Polyetherimide Resins
PEI is an amorphous engineering thermoplastic resin. Figure 3.42 shows the
chemical structure of PEI. PEI has high heat resistance, excellent electrical prop-
erties, high strength and modulus, and excellent processibility. Tg and amorphous
density at 25 are 216 °C and 1.27 g/cc, respectively. Unmodiﬁed PEI resin is
transparent and has inherent ﬂame resistance and low smoke evolution [101].
PEI can be processed on conventional thermoplastic molding equipment. PEI
resin is available for general-purpose injection molding, blow molding, foam
molding, and extrusion. PEI is extruded to produce proﬁles, coated wires, sheets,
and ﬁlms. The glass ﬁber reinforcement of the PEI provides it with both greater
tensile strength and rigidity while simultaneously improving the dimensional sta-
bility [102].
PEI resists a broad range of chemicals under varied conditions of stress and
temperatures. PEI is compatible with aliphatic hydrocarbons and alcohols such as
gasoline and gasohol, mineral-salt solutions, dilute bases, and fully halogenated
hydrocarbons [103].
PEI is often used instead of polysulfone and commonly speciﬁed for aerospace,
automotive, medical, and packaging applications. PEI is resistant to UV and gamma
radiation. This material can be easily machined and provides cost savings over
ceramics in electrical applications [104].
Xian et al. [105] demonstrated the inﬂuence of SCF reinforcement on the sliding
wear of PEI composites. Figure 3.43 shows the evolution of the speciﬁc wear rates

with the SCF fraction. It was found that the addition of SCF reduced the speciﬁc
wear rate of PEI by approximately 60 times at room temperature, and 80 times at
150 °C, respectively, owing to several functions of SCF, i.e., reinforcing, lubri-
cating, and thermal conducting functions.
3.2.7 Polyethersulfone Resins
Polyethersulfone (PES) is an excellent heat-resistant, transparent, noncrystalline
engineering plastic containing ether and sulfone groups in their backbone chains.
Figure 3.44 shows the chemical structure of PES.
PES resins exhibit high-temperature performance along with a high Tg, good
dimensional stability, outstanding rigidity even at high temperatures, excellent
insulation properties, biocompatibility, and inherent ﬂame retardation [106].
PES can be molded using conventional plastics processing equipment such as
injection molding, extrusion, compression molding, solution casting, and sintering.
Because of its amorphous nature, PES has excellent dimensional stability and can
be easily processed with highly polar solvents, which are suitable for applications
requiring similar tolerances and little dimensional change over a wide temperature
range. PES composites offer distinct advantages over thermosets, namely shorter
processing times, better toughness, reduced storage and scrap, and reparability
[107].
Wu et al. [108] studied the processing and properties of solution impregnated
CF-reinforced PES composites. Table 3.4 lists the ﬂexural test results of the
composites using different molding cycles. A higher molding temperature and
longer molding time increased the ﬂexural strength from 44 to 71 MPa.

3.2.8 Polyethylene Resins
PE is a thermoplastic polymer consisting of long chains of the ethylene monomer,
as shown in Fig. 3.45. PE is a light, versatile synthetic resin made by the poly-
merization of ethylene. PE can be produced by polymerization techniques,
including radical, anionic addition, cationic addition, and ion coordination. Its
simple basic structure can be either linear or branched to a greater or lesser degree.
PE is a member of the important family of polyoleﬁn resins. It is the most widely
used plastic worldwide, products ranging from clear food wraps and shopping bags
to detergent bottles and automobile fuel tanks. It can also be slit or spun into either
synthetic ﬁbers or modiﬁed to take on the elastic properties of rubber [108–110].
PE is available over a range of ﬂexibilities and other properties depending on the
production process. PE can be formed using a wide variety of thermoplastic pro-
cessing methods and is particularly useful when moisture resistance and low costs
are necessary.
The mechanical properties of PE depend signiﬁcantly on variables such as the
extent and type of branching, crystal structure, and molecular weight. PE is clas-
siﬁed into varieties such as low-density PE (LDPE), linear low-density PE
(LLDPE), and high-density PE (HDPE). LDPE, LLDPE, and HDPE typically have
a density value ranging from 0.91 to 0.925 g/cm3, 0.918 to 0.94 g/cm3, and 0.935 to
0.96 g/cm3, respectively [111, 112].
LDPE is prepared from gaseous ethylene under high pressures and temperatures
in the presence of oxide initiators. LDPE has a high degree of short and long chain
branching, and weak intermolecular forces as the attraction between the instanta-
neous-dipole and induced-dipole is less. This results in low tensile strength and
increased ductility. The high degree of branches with long chains endows the
molten LDPE with unique and desirable ﬂow properties. LDPE is a ﬂexible material
with a melting point of approximately 110 °C. LDPE is used for both rigid con-
tainers and plastic ﬁlm applications [113].
LLDPE is made through the copolymerization of ethylene with 1-butene and
small amounts of 1-hexene and 1-octene, using either Ziegler–Natta or metallocene
catalysts. LLDPE is a substantially linear polymer, with signiﬁcant numbers of
short branches. LLDPE exhibits higher tensile strength, impact, and puncture
resistance compared to LDPE. LLDPE is used predominantly in the packaging ﬁlm
owing to its toughness, ﬂexibility, and relative transparency [114].
HDPE can be produced at low temperatures and pressures, using Ziegler–Natta
and metallocene catalysts or activated chromium oxide (Phillips catalyst). HDPE
has a low degree of branching and consequently, stronger intermolecular forces and

tensile strength. HDPE is used in products and packaging such as milk jugs,
detergent bottles, margarine tubs, garbage containers, and water pipes [115].
Zhang et al. [116] demonstrated the selective location and double percolation of
CF-ﬁlled HDPE/isotactic polypropylene (iPP) blends. Figure 3.46 shows the
dependence of the electrical conductivity on the VGCF content for HDPE, iPP, and
HDPE/iPP blends. The HDPE samples exhibited a percolation threshold at 2.5 phr
(parts per hundred parts resin) VGCF content, whereas for the iPP samples, the
percolation threshold was 1.75 phr VGCF content. This was owing to the different
ﬁller dispersion states in the two polymers.
3.2.9 Polyphenylene Sulﬁde Resins
Polyphenylene sulﬁde (PPS) is formed by the reaction of sodium sulﬁde with p-
dichlorobenzene, as shown in Fig. 3.47. PPS is an organic polymer having a
symmetrical, rigid backbone chain consisting of recurring p-substituted benzene
rings and sulfur atoms. PPS is a semicrystalline, high-performance engineering
thermoplastic.
PPS exhibits outstanding chemical resistance, thermal stability, dimensional
stability, and ﬁre resistance. The extreme inertness of PPS toward organic solvents,
and inorganic salts and bases makes for an outstanding performance as a corrosion-
resistant coating, suitable for contact with foods [117].
PPS can be molded, extruded, or machined to high tolerances. In its pure solid
form, it may be opaque white to light tan in color. PPS resins are available as

powders for slurry coating and electrostatic spraying. Because of its low viscosity,
PPS can be molded with a high loading of ﬁllers and reinforcements, which is
needed to compensate for its inherent brittleness.
Fillers and reinforcements can also increase the strength, surface properties,
dimensional stability, electrical properties, and overall cost. Glass-ﬁber-reinforced
PPS is used for the mechanical and electronic applications requiring high
mechanical strength, impact resistance, and insulating characteristics [118].
Xu et al. [118] studied the tribological behavior of PPS/CF composite coating
under dry sliding and water lubrication. Figure 3.48 shows the variations in the
friction coefﬁcient of the composite coating with the sliding content of CF at the
rate of 0.43 m/s under 200 N. This showed that the friction coefﬁcient of the
composite coating appeared to slightly decrease with the increasing CF content,
both under dry- and water-lubricated conditions. At the same time, the friction
coefﬁcient under water-lubricated conditions was much lower than that under dry
sliding.
3.2.10 Polypropylene Resins
PP is a thermoplastic polymer with a linear structure made from the propylene
monomer using Ziegler–Natta polymerization and metallocene catalysis polymer-
ization, as shown in Fig. 3.49.
The short segments of PP show examples of isotactic and syndiotactic tacticity,
as depicted in Fig. 3.50.
PP resins have cheap, lowest density (0.90–0.92 g/cm3), high tensile and com-
pressive strength, melting point of 160 °C, excellent dielectric properties, and
nontoxicity and are used in a wide variety of applications, including packaging and
labeling, textiles, stationery, plastic parts and reusable containers of various types,

banknotes. As an addition polymer made using the propylene monomer, it is
unusually resistant to several chemical solvents, bases, and acids [119–121].
In general, homopolymers can be used for housing, housewares, packaging,
cassette holders and ﬁbers, monoﬁlaments, and ﬁlm tapes; copolymers are preferred
for all applications exposed to cold environments and widely used for pipes,
containers, boat hulls, seat shells, and automotive parts.
In order to improve a few properties, PP formulas may include additives such as
pigments, carbon black, rubbers, antioxidants, and UV stabilizers. PP is available in
the form of molding powder, extruded sheets, cast ﬁlms, textile staples, and con-
tinuous ﬁlament yarns [122–124].
Li et al. [125] demonstrated the interfacial compatibility of PP composites ﬁlled
with surface-treated CF. Figure 3.51 shows the three-point bending value of PP/CF
composites as a function of treatment time. It was observed that the bending
strength and modulus increased with the increasing treatment time, thereby indi-
cating that the interfacial adhesion between CF and PP matrix increased.

Chapter 4
Surface Treatment and Sizing of Carbon
Fibers
Soo-Jin Park and Long-Yue Meng
Abstract Surface treatment and sizing for carbon ﬁbers are discussed primarily to
identify the mechanism of interphase formation. The objective of this chapter is to
review the surface treatment and sizing of carbon ﬁbers (CFs) used in the manufac-
turing composites. The surface properties of the CFs were experimentally charac-
terized, including the chemical compositions, surface free energy, acid–base
interactions, and dispersive and polar components. It will be also presented that a
number of oxidizing agents and gases have been used to surface treat the carbons, such
as the plasma, electrochemical oxidation, and wet chemical and thermal treatments.
4.1 Introduction
Carbon ﬁbers (CFs) have received much attention lately for their many potential
applications in different matrix materials owing to their properties, processability,
and recyclability. However, raw CFs need to be treated and/or sized as part of the
manufacturing process. Designing a suitable surface-treatment method is a requisite
to ensure that the high strength of the CFs is maintained during handling and
composite manufacture. The surface treatment or sizing method is also equally
important to ensure the formation of CF-matrix interface [1].
It is well known that the surface treatment of CFs is essential for improving the
adhesion between the ﬁbers and matrix. The interfacial and physical or chemical
properties of CF-reinforced matrix composites are signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the
interfacial characteristics existing between the reinforcing CFs and matrix. The
characteristics of CF-matrix interface could be either chemically or physically
altered by both ﬁber surface treatment and sizing [1–20].

Selecting suitable surface-treatment methods might modify the CF surface by
increasing the surface area, surface functional groups, electroproperties components
on the surface for providing the CF-matrix interactions, and enhancing other
properties of the CFs. For example, the mechanical properties of CFs/polymer
composites could be improved through the interface between the CFs and polymer
using certain methods for the modiﬁcation of the reinforcing CF surface. The
bonding strength between the ﬁbers and matrix could be enhanced through the ﬁber
surface treatment [15–22]. Until now, the commercially available CF surfaces were
normally coated with a sizing layer, which was usually either a solution or an
emulsion consisting of polymeric components. The sizing could alter the handling of
the CF, which included ﬁber protection, ﬁber alignment, and ﬁber wettability [23].
CF surface treatment and sizing are discussed primarily to identify the mechanism of
interphase formation.Theobjective ofthis chapter isto reviewthe surface treatment and
sizing of CFs used in the manufacturing composites. Also, the surface properties of the
CFs were experimentally characterized, including the chemical compositions, surface
free energy, acid–base interactions, and dispersive and polar components. A number of
oxidizing agents and gases have been used to surface treat the CFs, such as the plasma,
electrochemical oxidation, and wet chemical and thermal treatments [24–70].
4.2 Oxidation of Carbon Fibers
The effects of oxidation on the CFs have been thoroughly investigated because of
its importance in the ﬁelds of nuclear, medical, and materials science. Basically, the
effect of the oxidation on CFs manifests as the displacement of carbon atoms from
their graphitic structures. A number of oxidizing agents and gases have been used to
surface treat the CFs, such as HNO3 [24, 25], HSO4 [26], H2O2 [27], NaOCl [28],
KMnO4 [28], RuO4 [28–30], NaClO3 [31, 32], Na2Cr2O7 [32], NaIO4 [33], air [34,
35], CO2, and H2O [17, 36].
4.2.1 Gaseous Oxidants
Dry oxidation normally employs air, oxygen (O2), or ozone (O3) as the oxidizing
gas. Gas-phase oxidation (such as air, O2, O3, and CO2) of CFs has been pursued in
order to enhance the ﬁber–matrix bond. The advantages of oxidation in air included
low cost, simple operation, lack of pollution, and excellent homogeneity, which
make it one of the best approaches [38–47].
4.2.1.1 Air Oxidation
When exposed to air at high temperatures, the CFs oxidizes, the properties of com-
posites change, and mechanical properties degrade. Tong et al. [39] treated

polyacrylonitrile-based CFs with air at temperatures over the range 400–700 °C. With
increasing oxidation temperature, the crystallite height decreased gradually, while the
d002 spacing increased presumably owing to the reaction of oxygen with carbon. The
tensile strength decreased signiﬁcantly, while the tensile modulus was nearly
unchanged. An increase in the CF density after oxidation suggested that the glass-like
carbon in the ﬁber was easier to burn off compared to the more graphitic carbon. The
spacing d002 of the graphite layers increased, while the graphite size in the ﬁber
decreased. The larger d002 after high-temperature oxidation might have been because
of the reaction of oxygen with some C atoms in the graphite layers to produce func-
tional groups such as –COOH, C–O–C, and C=O [39, 40, 45]. The gradual decrease in
Lc(002) with increasing oxidation temperature was in agreement with the increasing
mass loss. The size of the graphite crystal in the outer layer of the ﬁber became smaller
owing to the burning of C atoms during oxidation, resulting in the smaller average
crystal size Lc(002). The higher the oxidation temperature, the greater was the mass
being burned off, and the smaller was the average crystal size in the resultant CFs [39].
Wang et al. [41] found changes in the microporous structure and surface
properties of pitch-based activated CFs upon air oxidation at 300, 400, 500, and
600 °C. The adsorption isotherms on P and oxT-P with T below 400 °C were
actually similar to each other except for a slight enhancement in the adsorption by
oxidation, which appeared in or began from the sharply rising range at low P/P0.
On the other hand, the oxidation of P above 500 °C changed the N2-adsorption
isotherms from the Ia type, having risen sharply, to a round Ib type, indicating the
formation of wider micropores. Air oxidation at 600 °C greatly increased the N2-
adsorption content, thereby manifesting in either further opening of the pores or
micropore formation by air activation under this condition [41].
Wang and Wu prepared a three-dimensionally braided CF-reinforced carbon/
epoxy resin (C/Ep) composites and studied the effect of air oxidation of the ﬁbers
on the properties of the composites [42]. They found that the speciﬁc surface area
and surface roughness of the oxidized CFs increased while their tensile strength
decreased with increasing oxidation temperature or time. The ﬂexural strength,
ﬂexural modulus, and shear strength of the C/Ep composites under the optimum
treatment at 450 °C for 1 h increased by 149, 91, and 29 %, respectively, compared
to those of the untreated samples, but the impact strength decreased by 23 % [42].
Rong et al. [45] investigated that the effect of air oxidization on the adsorption of
formaldehyde by the Rayon-based activated carbon ﬁbers (ACFs). Because pure
formaldehyde was not stable in air, the adsorption of its vapor was simultaneously
investigated with that of water vapor. ACF0 (pure ACFs) and A-350-1h (oxidized at
350 °C for 1 h) possess a reasonable number of micropores, with a small fraction of
mesopores, but without any macropores. A-420-1h (oxidized at 420 °C for 1 h) is also
microporous and possesses a reasonable number of mesopores with relatively high
pore volumes. A-450-1h (oxidized at 450 °C for 1 h) is microporous with some
proportion of mesopores, but both the micropore and mesopore volumes of A-450-1h
are obviously lower than those of A-420-1h and A-350-1h. This might be owing to the
violent reaction between the carbon andair at 450 °C, as mentioned earlier herein. This
showed that the oxidation temperature obviously affected the pore size distributions of
4.2

ACFs. Both A-420-2h (oxidized at 420 °C for 2 h) and A-420-3h (oxidized at 420 °C
for 3 h) are microporous, containing a small proportion of mesopores, but without any
macropores. The pore volumes, especially of micropores, are much lower than those
of A-420-1h and ACF0, illustrating that prolonged air oxidation time (in this exper-
iment, oxidation time >1 h) could destroy the micropore skeleton of ACFs, thereby
decreasing the pore volume. Therefore, it could be inferred that the air oxidation time
could affect the pore size distributions of ACFs dramatically [45].
Seo and Park prepared the air-oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)
electrodes from catalytically grown MWCNTs of high purity and narrow diameter
distribution. The experimental results showed that the air oxidation modiﬁed the
intrinsic structures of individual MWCNTs and slightly improved the dispersity of
the MWCNTs. The TEM images of pristine and air-oxidized MWCNTs at 600 °C
are shown in Fig. 4.1. The pristine MWCNTs were approximately 30–40 nm in
diameter, several micrometers in length and randomly entangled, while the air-
oxidized MWCNTs were detached mutually and their lengths were <1 μm. Com-
paring the two TEM (transmission electron microscopy) images, it was evident that
the lengths of the air-oxidized MWCNTs were shorter than those of the pristine
MWCNTs, and the dispersity of the air-oxidized MWCNTs was enhanced com-
pared to that of the pristine MWCNTs. This was good for the enlargement of the
BET-speciﬁc surface area and pore volume. Moreover, the speciﬁc area increased
compared to that of the pristine MWCNTs. The MWCNT powder was oxidized by
air, and the amorphous carbonaceous matter jammed in the MWCNT aggregates
could be etched away or stripped off. Moreover, oxygen attacked the curvatures of
the MWCNTs, resulting in the breaking of the MWCNT walls. The binding
between the entangled MWCNTs was weakened by the broken MWCNTs and
removal of the amorphous carbon. Many MWCNTs were detached from the
aggregates, resulting in either partial or complete disassembly of the aggregates,
and an increase in the surface area. This increase was the result of two factors:
Firstly, the MWCNT surfaces were exposed after the entangled MWCNTs were

dispersed; secondly, the internal cavities of the MWCNTs were opened owing to
the caps being destroyed and cylindrical walls being broken. As the annealing
temperature increased, more of the MWCNTs were broken and uncapped MWCNT
aggregates were disassembled. Moreover, oxygen attacked the cylindrical walls of
the MWCNTs. As shown in the TEM image of air-oxidized MWCNTs at 600 °C,
some outer graphitic layers were etched off, yielding rough “convex–concave”
walls. This resulted in the further enhancement of speciﬁc area, as listed in
Table 4.1. Subsequently, the speciﬁc surface area decreased slightly with the
increasing air oxidation temperature up to a maximum of 600 °C [47].
4.2.1.2 O2, O3 Oxidation
To study the inﬂuence of O2 oxidation kinetics on the surfaces of the CFs, Poila and
Serra demonstrated that T-300 CF oxidation appeared to be gas-phase diffusion,
which was limited over the temperature range of 816–1,538 °C [48]. CF oxidation
kinetics was consistent with the predicted weak dependence on the temperature and
concentration for the transport through a laminar boundary layer. Under most
conditions, the C/SiC composite oxidation kinetics was dominated by C ﬁber
oxidation rather than SiC oxidation. The weight losses in the composites were
observed at all temperatures between 816 and 1,538 °C and all oxygen partial
pressures between 50 and 0.1 % O2. The weight loss rates for the composites were
highest at 816 °C and decreased at higher temperatures [48].
The results of Lamouroux et al. [49] for temperatures <700 °C showed that there
was a large activation energy that reﬂected the energetics of the carbon–oxygen
reaction ðC + 1/2O2ðg) = CO(g)). At the higher temperatures in this study
(T > 800 °C), the weaker temperature dependence suggested a change in the rate-
controlling mechanism. Based on the discussion of Walker et al., it was proposed that
the oxygen contacting the surface reacted with the CF rapidly relative to the transport
rate of oxygen to the surface through the gas boundary layer. Thus, the reaction at
high temperatures was limited by the gas-phase diffusion of O2 to the surface [50].
Hosokai et al. [51] found that O2 inﬂuenced the resulting product distribution in
completely different ways at 700 and 800 °C. O2 was consumed at 700 °C mainly
by the oxidation of tar and light oxygenates, forming CO, CO2, and H2O, unless the
ratio of O2/carbon involved in the nascent volatiles (O/C) exceeded 0.7 mol of

O/mol of C. On the other hand, the oxidation at 800 °C selectively consumed H2
and lower hydrocarbons, leaving the residual tar yield nearly unchanged. Such
different behaviors of O2 were mainly because of the difference in the character-
istics of the thermal cracking of the tar and light oxygenates between 700 and
800 °C. The thermal cracking at 700 °C left the tar with a molecular mass (MM)
range of up to >1,000, which was decomposed in the presence of O2 but incom-
pletely. At 800 °C, the tar was decomposed quickly even in the presence of O2,
forming refractory aromatics with a MM range of up to 400 together with soot,
while the lighter gases were oxidized. A portion of tar, obtained by cracking at
700 °C, was deposited inside a ceramic–ﬁber ﬁlter downstream of the reactor,
whose temperature was 350–500 °C; however, the deposit could not be removed
mechanically. The entire tar, obtained from the cracking at 800 °C, was allowed to
pass through the ﬁlter, regardless of O/C. It was thus found that the gas-phase
temperature range 700–800 °C was critical for the tar property, which was relevant
for dust removal over the range 350–500 °C [51].
The ozone method was also used to modify the surface activity of CFs, which
improved the compressive and ﬂexural strengths of carbon/carbon composites [52].
Jin et al. prepared the carbon/carbon composites with the untreated and ozone-
treated CFs. The ozone treatment increased the compressive and ﬂexural strengths
of the carbon/carbon composites. This was probably because of the chemical
interaction between the CFs and pitch in the matrix and increasing surface
roughness of CFs conduced to the interfaces of CFs and the carbon-matrix
strengthened. It has been previously shown that the chemical bonding was
important for increasing the adhesion between the CFs and carbon matrix. It could
be ascertained that the adhesion of carbon/carbon composites showed better
improvement with ozone treatment at 120 °C for 6 min, compared to that observed
in the other methods. At 160 °C, the ozone rapidly decomposed to oxidize the CFs.
Therefore, the compressive and ﬂexural strengths of the carbon/carbon composites
decreased. In conclusion, the optimum conditions for the ozone treatment were the
temperature of 120 °C and duration of 6 min [52].
Ozone is a powerful oxidant with a high selectivity for unsaturated bonds. Its
reaction with saturated bonds proceeds slowly. It is known that ozone produces
hydroperoxy (HOO·) and superoxide (·O2
−) radicals as intermediates during
decomposition in the liquid phase [59]. Usually, they react again with ozone and
produce hydroxyl (·OH) with ozonide (·O3
−) radicals as intermediates. The
hydroxyl radical has greater oxidizing power (Eo: +3.06 V) compared to ozone, and
its reactions with organics are rapid. Park et al. have previously reported the
inﬂuence of ozone surface treatment on the activated carbons [58, 61]. The purpose
of that study was to determine the effect of the ozone treatment on the adsorption of
Cr(VI) and Cu(II) on ACFs [58]. The ozone was added to either NaOH or H2O2
initiator solutions to produce the hydroxyl radicals. The structural and functional
groups of ozone-treated ACFs were analyzed by varying the initiator. Table 4.2
shows the structural characteristics of the ACFs before and after ozone treatments
for 1 h in each solution. The average pore diameter was not largely affected by the
ozone treatment. However, the speciﬁc surface area of the ozonized ACFs in 1 M

NaOH solution decreased because of the pore-blocking phenomena by the sodium
ions of NaOH. On the other hand, despite the pore-blocking phenomena, the spe-
ciﬁc surface area of the ACFs ozonized with the H2O2 initiator increased. This was
because the carbon atoms on the surfaces of the ACFs reacted with the hydroxyl
radicals and were directly oxidized to carbon dioxide and converted into soluble
decomposition products. These were then oxidized to produce carbon dioxide
continuously, resulting in an increase in the speciﬁc surface area. The production of
carbon dioxide was veriﬁed by the conversion of the lactonic groups to phenolic
groups, as shown in Fig. 4.2 [58].
Activated carbons were modiﬁed by the ozone treatment to enhance the efﬁcient
removal of ammonia gas over the activated carbons. The variation in the adsorption
of ammonia against the reaction time of each specimen is shown in Fig. 4.3 [61]. It
shows that the ozone-treated activated carbons reveal much higher removal efﬁ-
ciency compared to that of the pristine-activated carbons. This was because of the
acid–base interaction of each functional group containing oxygen on the surfaces of
activated carbons, which played a key role in the determination of the gas-
adsorption capacity.

4.2.1.3 CO2, H2O Oxidation
Sun et al. [36] reported that polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based carbon hollow ﬁbers
(PAN-ACHFs) can be activated using carbon dioxide. The burn-off and shrinkage
ratios were determined from a change in the weight and length before and after
activation. As shown in Fig. 4.2, the burn-off of PAN-ACHF slowly increased with
the increasing oxidation time, from 1 to 5 h, and then hardly changed. The
shrinkage of PAN-ACHF almost did not change with the increasing oxidation time.
The BET surface area of the PAN-ACHF and surface area of mesopores gradually
increased on extending the activation time, and reached the maximum values, 780
and 180 m2 g−1, respectively, when the ﬁbers were activated at 800 °C for 100 min.
The number of pores on the surface of PAN-ACHF increased with the extending
activation time. The number of mesopores in the PAN-ACHF, composed of ﬁbers
activated for different durations, increases with the extending activation time while
the dominant pore sizes of the mesopores in the PAN-ACHF were over the range
2–5 nm [36].
Kelemen and Freund used XPS to characterize the glassy carbon surfaces fol-
lowing exposure to O2 and CO2. The clean glassy carbon samples were oxidized in
O2 and CO2 and characterized using XPS [53]. The O(1s) signal was on the same
intensity scale. Each sample was oxidized for 300 s under speciﬁed conditions and
cooled in the reactant gas. A negligible loss of carbon to the gaseous products
occurred at 300 °C. The oxidations in O2 and CO2 at 700 °C corresponded to the
carbon weight losses of 20 % and <0.1 %, respectively. They found multiple O(1s)
components in the observed peak, which will be discussed later. It was striking that
the same amount of oxygen along with the same O(1s) line shape were observed
after CO2 exposure at 300 and 700 °C. The areas of the O(1s) and C(1s) signals
were used in conjunction with the standard XPS sensitivity factors to determine the
oxygen concentration in the sampling region. The amount following the oxidation
by CO2 corresponded to 15 oxygen atoms per 100 carbon atoms [53].

Surface Treatment and Sizing of Carbon Fibers

Zaini et al. [54] produced ACFs derived from PAN by using steam and CO2 as
activating agents and examined their ability to remove heavy metals from the
aqueous solution. The drawback was that missing delocalized π-electrons were
produced during the activation of oxidized ﬁbers initially treated at 300–350 °C.
This deﬁnitely resulted in the formation of the imperfect graphitic structure. Con-
versely, a near-ideal graphitization could be anticipated during the activation of the
polymer ladder structures of oxidized ﬁbers previously treated at 400–450 °C. The
activated carbons derived from PAN were highly microporous with the pores
centered in the supermicropore region. Steam was found to be better than CO2 in
generating a higher surface area, but the resulting yield was relatively lower [54].
4.2.2 Acid Oxidation
After carbonization, the CFs had a surface that did not bond well with the epoxies
and other materials used in composite materials. The main aim of oxidation of the
CF surfaces is to obtain more hydrophilicity. The addition of oxygen atoms to the
surface provides better chemical bonding properties. In general, the oxygen-con-
taining groups increase the adhesive interfacial force in the polymeric matrix by
behaving as either acids or bases, which possess ion-exchange properties. Among
the oxidation treatments, acid oxidation is the most widely used method to increase
the total acidity during the wet oxidation treatment [55–77].
4.2.2.1 Inorganic Acid Oxidation
Various densities of the functional groups have been produced on CF surfaces as a
function of the reaction time. Oxidative treatments produce active sites by forming
carbon–oxygen functional groups, but oxidation also increases the surface rough-
ness and surface area by etching [55–73].
Park et al. [57] studied the effect of nitric acid treatment on the multimetal
adsorption by basic ACFs from the interfacial and textural points of view. One molar
nitric acid at its boiling point was used for the oxidation offunctional groups, without
causing damage to the ﬁber surfaces. The results of 1-mM adsorptions of both copper
and nickel on ACFs are shown in Fig. 4.4a. From the results, it was evident that the
copper ions were more favorably adsorbed on the ACFs than the nickel ions over the
pH range investigated. Such selective adsorption resulted from the interaction
between the adsorbate and adsorbent and could be ascribed to the characteristics such
as pore size and distribution and speciﬁc polarity. Also, the size of the hydrated
copper ion was much smaller than that of the nickel ion; consequently, the hydrated
copper ion could more easily penetrate into the pores of the ACFs. The amount of the
adsorbed metal ions on the ACFs increased, reaching a maximum at pH 6, followed
by a drastic decrease. This was because of the isoelectric point of the ACFs,
which was quantitatively changed by the amount of the oxygen-containing surface
4.2

functional groups. Figure 4.4b shows the removal of the multimetal ions from the
acidic ACFs as a function of pH. The amounts of both adsorbed copper and nickel
ions relatively increased at the low end of the pH range when compared to the results
of the ACFs. This was mostly ascribed to the fact that the oxygen-containing surface
functional groups increased from the modiﬁcation with nitric acid, thereby resulting
in the shift of the isoelectric point of the ACFs to the lower pH. This increase in the
amount of the adsorbed metal ions was mostly because of the increase in the total
acidity of the ACFs. This demonstrated that there were certain types of carbons that
exhibited amphoteric behavior owing to the presence of the weakly acidic functional
groups. For relatively high pH values, the carbon behaved as an acid by adsorbing
OH−, whereas at low pH values, it behaved as a base, i.e., it adsorbed H+ ions.
Therefore, the adsorption capacity of the metal ions was mainly inﬂuenced by the
weakly acidic functional groups (e.g., lactones) on the carbon surface at pH < pI and
the strongly acidic functional groups (e.g., carboxyl) at pH > pI [57].

Surface Treatment and Sizing of Carbon Fibers

Perrard et al. [75] investigated the oxidation kinetics of an excellulose-activated
carbon cloth using an aqueous solution of NaOCl at ambient temperature. The
oxidation resulted from a coupling between the chemical kinetics and physical
transport kinetics. During the ﬁrst stage (0–7 min), the molar ratio CO/CO2 sharply
decreased from 5.1 to 2.2 while the selectivity ratio SIII/SI rapidly increased.
Expectedly, with NaOCl being a strong oxidizing agent, the oxidation process led
to the formation of carboxylic groups, though a large number of quinone groups
remained. In contrast, the loss of matter dominated the second stage (7–60 min)
because the samples lost weight during the oxidation and a decrease in the ﬁber
diameter was observed. At the end of the second stage, 21 wt% oxygen remained in
the ﬁbers. Such high oxygen content involving a large proportion of carboxylic
groups, whose creation was accompanied by C–C bond rupture, indicated a pro-
found modiﬁcation of the ﬁber structure. Further oxidation during the third stage
(60–90 min) led to severe aromatic ring cleavages; for instance, the oxidation of
triphenylene to mellitic acid. The amount of oxygen ﬁxed by the solid per gram of
the sample decreased while the ratio CO/CO2 slightly increased. This occurred
because the intensive attack on the ﬁbers yielded strongly oxidized organic com-
pounds, which proceeded to the liquid phase. Consequently, the CFs lost their
mechanical strength and the fabric was deeply damaged under the stirring condi-
tions of the solution in the reactor. The change in the mean diameter of the ﬁbers
had been measured using ampliﬁed SEM micrographs [75]. It was observed that
there was no change in this diameter for oxidation times smaller than 15 min. For
oxidation times over the range 15–60 min, the diameter of the ﬁbers slightly
decreased from 10.2 to 9.4 μm. A decrease in the mean diameter was steeper for
oxidation times larger than one hour (third stage). During this stage, the transfer of
carbon-containing compounds or matter to the aqueous medium largely dominated.
The production of a small quantity of carbon dioxide also possibly occurred [75].
Fathi et al. [76] reported the surface chemistry and surface roughness of CFs
after the oxidation treatment with sulfuric acid and the effect on ﬁber–matrix
adhesion and thus the performance of the composite after the treatment. The values
of stiffness, ﬂexural modulus, and ﬂexural strength are listed in Table 4.3. It can be
seen that the ﬂexural modulus of the treated CF composites slightly increased. This
increase, as stated previously for the storage modulus, could have been because of
the better compatibility with the polyester resin compared to the untreated ﬁbers.
Also, the ﬂexural strength of the composite rods was signiﬁcantly improved
compared to the untreated CF composites, especially CFS10.

4.2.2.2 Organic Acid Oxidation
Tang and coauthors have reported the PA (polyamide) 66 composites ﬁlled with
arylboronic acid-treated CF. They studied the inﬂuence of the treatment of the CF
surface with arylboronic acid on the mechanical and tribological behavior of the
PA66 composites [77]. To study the changes of the carbon surfaces, the speciﬁc ratio
of each oxygen functional group in the C1s regime is showed in Table 4.4. We found
that the number of oxygen functional groups, including C–O (BE = 286.1–286.3 eV)
and O–C=O (BE = 288.8–289.1 eV), increased after the treatment, while the number
of C=C groups decreased. This indicated that the surface treatment probably broke
the C=C (BE = 284.6 eV) bond and bound the oxygen functional groups to the ﬁber
surfaces. The SEM results showed that PA66 peeled off the ﬁbers on the worn
surfaces of the composites with the untreated ﬁbers, where there are ﬁbers pulling
out from the composites. The surfaces of the composites were severely worn out.
While the PA66 matrices and treated ﬁbers had good adhesion to the worn surfaces
of the composites with treated ﬁbers, containing scarce CF [77]. The CFs on the
worn surfaces of the composites bore most of the load between the contact surfaces
and reduced the real contact area of the counterpart and shear evolution on the
adhesive point. Also, the self-lubrication effect of the CF reduced the friction
coefﬁcient. The peeling CF could cause abrasion on the contact surfaces of the
composites, which could accelerate the peeling of the matrix [77].
Xu et al. [78] studied the oxidation–reduction and preirradiation-induced
methods to study the effect of the modiﬁcation by acrylic acid on the wetting and
adsorption abilities of CFs in the epoxy solution and the interfacial properties of the
CFs/epoxy. The chemical bonding, interdiffusion, and hydrogen bonding in the
interface between the CFs and matrix resins might contribute to an improvement in
the interfacial adhesion. The increasing surface energy of CFs beneﬁted the increase
in the surface energy difference between the CFs and epoxy resins and thereby
improved the wettability of the ﬁbers with epoxy resins. As a result, the interfacial
adhesion of CF/epoxy composites was strengthened and ILSS increased. The ILSS
of the modiﬁed CF/epoxy composites increased by more than 15 % compared to
that of the untreated CF/epoxy composites. Also, the preirradiated CF/epoxy
composites outperformed the oxidation–reduction-grafted CF/epoxy composites in
the strength value of ILSS [78].

4.2.3 Electrochemical Oxidation
Recently, several studies dealing with the environmental applications of electro-
chemistry have demonstrated that many compounds could be treated with the
electrochemical oxidation instead of traditional methods [78–85]. This electro-
chemical process requires neither chemical pretesting nor chemical adjustment of
the wastewater, little space, and produces fewer by-products and less sludge. The
electrochemical oxidation yielded either oxygenated products or electrophilic spe-
cies readily reacting with unsaturated compounds, depending on the experimental
conditions. The oxidized carbons possessed certain unique properties owing to the
oxygen-containing functional groups such as carboxylic, lactonic, and phenolic
groups on their surfaces [86–90].
The ﬁbers were subjected to the electrochemical oxidation under different
conditions (Fig. 4.5). Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), ammonium hydrogen carbonate
(NH4HCO3), ammonium carbonate ((NH4)2CO3), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and nitric
acid (HNO3) were used as electrolytes at 3, 5, 10, and 20 wt%, respectively. The
voltage of the oxidation changed over the range 0.5–5.0 V (0.5, 1, 2, and 5 V). The
oxidation was carried out in a continuous process; the treatment time changed

linearly with the passage of the ﬁber through the electrolyte; two passage rates, 20
and 30 cm/min, were used in the experiments. The oxidized ﬁbers were washed
with the distilled water in a continuous process [86].
The fragmentation experiments revealed considerable differences in the behavior
of the ﬁbers oxidized under different conditions. The interaction between the ﬁber
and epoxy matrix was characterized by the IFSS changes over a wide range
depending on the type and concentration of the electrolyte as well as voltage used.
The IFSS values determined under different conditions are also listed in Table 4.5.
The average standard deviation of IFSS was approximately 20 %, which corre-
sponded to the values previously published in the literature [42–94]. The oxidation
in 20 wt% ammonium carbonate and ammonium hydrogen carbonate solutions at
0.5 V led only to an insigniﬁcant increase in IFSS. Under the same conditions, the
effect of sulfuric acid was also moderate, while the oxidation in nitric acid and
sodium hydroxide resulted in an enhancement of the IFSS values, thereby

indicating strong interfacial interaction. At low voltage (0.5 V), oxidation in HNO3
led to an increase in IFSS with increasing concentration; also, increasing voltage
had the same effect at low electrolyte concentration (3 wt%). At high concentration
and voltage, IFSS somewhat decreased. This result emphasized the importance of
optimization and that appropriate oxidation conditions must be used in order to
achieve maximum efﬁciency.
Park et al. [81] studied the anodic oxidation of ACFs in order to introduce the
surface functional groups onto the ACF surfaces. Their research indicated that the
extent of adsorption and adsorption rate of Cr(VI) increased with increasing number
of the surface oxide groups of ACFs, even though both the speciﬁc surface area and
micropore volume did not signiﬁcantly change, as was the case with the anodic
oxidation treatments on ACFs. The phenol-based ACFs (mat type, Kuraray) were
subjected to an electrolytic reaction in an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (35
wt%), wherein the negative ions were attracted to the surfaces of the ACFs acting as
anodes, thereby modifying the ACF surfaces. In the FT-IR spectra, as seen in

1,180 cm−1). The amount of adsorption and the adsorption rate of Cr(VI) from the
aqueous Cr(VI) solution increased when the surface chemistry of the ACFs was
modiﬁed through the anodic oxidation, as shown in Fig. 4.7, which then led to an
increase in the number of surface functional groups without signiﬁcantly changing
the surface area. As a result, the amount of adsorption and adsorption rate of Cr(VI)
from an aqueous solution increased owing to a large amount of the surface func-
tional groups on the ACFs.
4.2.4 Treatment with Nonoxidative Agents
Ehlert and Sodano reported that the surfaces of CFs were functionalized by the
reaction of the existing surface defects with isopropylidene malonate [91].
The reaction used the existing defects rather than generating new ones to graft the
terminal malonic esters, thereby creating a carboxyl-functionalized surface. The
reaction did not employ oxidation and preserves the tensile strength of the ﬁber.
Also, the reaction was validated using X-ray photoelectron studies and Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy, whereby the expected malonic ester structure was
conﬁrmed. The usable surface coverage of the carboxylic acid groups doubled to
8.4 %. The effects of solvent, temperature, concentration, and reaction time were
studied. This functionalization could improve the composite interfaces without
sacriﬁcing the ﬁber strength and potentially open up a new paradigm in the func-
tionalization of the carbon surfaces [91].

4.3 Plasma Treatment
Plasma is a partially or fully ionized gas containing electrons, ions, and neutral
atoms or molecules; also called the fourth state of matter [92–110]. Gas plasma can
be produced by introducing the desired gas into a vacuum chamber, typically
0.1–10 Torr, and subsequently exciting the gas using radiofrequency energy. The
free radicals and electrons created in the plasma collide with the exposed surface of
the material, rupturing covalent bonds and creating free radicals. Plasma composed
of inorganic gases such as argon, helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen leads to
the implantation of atoms, radical generation, and etching reactions while plasma
composed of organic gases such as hydrocarbons and alkylsilanes leads to polymer-
forming reactions (Table 4.6) [110]. The schematic of the plasma device is shown
in Fig. 4.8.
Montes-Morán et al. [94] treated the ultrahigh modulus (UHM) CFs using
oxygen plasma. The “cleaning” effect of the plasma oxidation was depicted using
the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The SEM results showed that all the
P120 ﬁbers examined showed surfaces with long granular patterns as well as
scratched areas, most likely associated with the skin ﬂakes mentioned previously.
After the surface treatment, the new surfaces created by the plasma oxidation
consisted primarily of homogeneously stacked patches, with rare occurrences of

skin fragments. These patches, which also conﬁrmed the relatively ﬂat areas
observed on the untreated P120 ﬁbers, might consist of graphene structures whose
atomic resolution could be eventually achieved. Additionally, no ballistic sputtering
was detected on the treated surfaces.
Park and Kim [95] carried out the atmospheric pressure plasma treatment con-
taining oxygen on ACFs in order to enhance the surface functionality of the ACFs.
It was found that the number of oxygen functional groups such as C6H5OH and
O–C=O increased after the plasma treatment. However, a slight decrease in the
speciﬁc surface area was observed. The HCl removal efﬁciency of all the ACFs
modiﬁed by plasma treatment was higher than that of the untreated samples. The
efﬁciency increased up to P-O-3 and then decreased at P-O-4. This indicated that
the HCl removal efﬁciency was basically dependent on the surface functionality;
however, the control of the speciﬁc surface area was also important. In conclusion,
if the plasma treatment is accomplished with high oxygen content and well-
developed micropores, this technique could be a potentially useful and economic
method to remove the highly toxic hydrochloride gases from carbon surfaces. The
surface atomic compositions obtained using XPS are presented in Table 4.7. It was
observed that the surface of the ACFs was mainly composed of carbon, oxygen, and
nitrogen. The carbon and oxygen contents of the as-received sample were 90.4 %
and 7.8 at%, respectively; however, those of P-O-4 were 80.7 and 17.2 at%,
respectively. The O1s/C1s ratio of plasma-treated ACFs increased with the treatment
time owing to the conformation of the oxygen-containing surface functional groups
on the carbon surfaces.
Kim and Park [96] have described the preparation of ACFs coated with graphite
nanoﬁbers (GNFs). Low-pressure plasma-mixed gas (Ar/O2) treatment of the ACFs
led to the growth of the GNFs on their surfaces. Figure 4.9 shows the GNF-coated
ACFs prepared in this study. The ACFs treated at 300 W were fully covered by the
GNFs, but the diameter sizes of the GNFs produced were not homogeneous. Fig-
ure 4.9b, c shows the magniﬁed images of the GNFs produced. As evident in the
images, the GNFs were fairly straight. Figure 4.9d depicts the TEM image of a
single GNF ﬁber. It shows that the structure of the GNFs is in the form of stacked
graphite layers of the herringbone type. As shown in Fig. 4.9, we successfully
produced the GNF-coated ACFs under certain conditions (300 W, 13.56 MHz,
50 cm3 min−1 of Ar/O2 feeding) of low-pressure plasma. The diameters of the
GNFs varied over the range 50–100 nm.

4.4 Other Surface Modiﬁcation Methods
4.4.1 Radiation
Methods used for the oxidation of such nonpolar CF surfaces are mentioned in Sect.
4.3. Each of the methods mentioned above might cause a loss of ﬁber strength if the
treatment is excessively extended. Similarly, gamma ray or neutron radiation changes
the microstructure of the carbon materials and causes losses in the mechanical
properties at high radiation doses [97, 111–114]. It is known that the radiation affects
the crystal lattice by either the displacement of atoms within the lattice or electronic
excitation [112–114]. The electrons stripped from the atoms are believed to cause
dimensional (topographical) change in the CFs and create active sites on the ﬁber
surfaces, which may bind with the functional groups of the bulk polymers [112].
In particular, gamma ray radiation has been more widely used for radiation
grafting through which reactive groups on the surfaces of polymers could be created
[97, 112, 114]. Xu et el. [111] investigated the effect of γ-ray radiation on the
microstructural and mechanical properties of CFs, which were irradiated by a 60Co
source. The interlayer spacing d002 of the CFs decreased after irradiation. Tiwari
et al. [114] employed the γ-ray radiation technique with varying doses

(100–300 kGy) on the carbon fabric to develop composites with the polyetherimide
(PEI) matrix through the impregnation method followed by compression molding.
Any improvement in the friction and wear properties was correlated with that in
ILSS because of the carbon fabric treatment. The higher the dosage, the higher the
enhancement in ILSS and tribo-performance of the composites. Both these factors
were thought to be responsible for enhancing the ﬁber–matrix interface. For in-
depth analysis, various techniques such as ﬁber tension test, adhesion test, and
Raman spectroscopy were carried out [111].
Wan et al. [97] treated the PAN-based carbon ﬁbers (PAN-CFs) with gamma ray
radiation. The efﬁciency of the gamma ray radiation was compared with air oxi-
dation in terms of the variations in the surface structures of the CFs, and the
mechanical performance of their composites. The observed higher content of the
carboxyl group on the surfaces of the gamma-irradiated CFs was likely to be
responsible for the relatively stronger ﬁber–matrix bonding. Thus, it was concluded
that the gamma ray irradiation was effective in tailoring the surface properties of the
CFs. The data pertaining to the mechanical properties (including ﬂexural strength
and modulus and shear and impact strengths) of the 3D MC nylon-based com-
posites with various CFs demonstrated that after gamma ray irradiation, the ﬂexural
strength and modulus and shear strength increased by 36.2, 19.0, and 14.7 %,
respectively. The corresponding values for the composite samples reinforced with
the air-treated CFs were 31.7, 11.4, and 6.2 %, respectively. The stronger
mechanical properties of the gamma-irradiated ﬁber composites compared to those
of the air-treated ﬁber composites were attributed to their higher interfacial adhesion
(32 ± 2.9 Pa versus 24 ± 1.1 MPa) tested using an interlaminar shear test. This
suggested that the gamma ray irradiation was more efﬁcient in improving the
ﬁber–matrix adhesion compared to air oxidation [97].
Park and Seo et al. [101] also reported that the surface modiﬁcation of the CFs
via ion beam irradiation had a tremendous inﬂuence on the improvement of the
interfacial adhesive strength between the CFs and matrix resins in CF-reinforced
composites. They studied the effects of the Ar+-ion beam irradiation on the phys-
icochemical properties such as surface composition and mechanical interfacial
properties of PAN-based high-strength CFs irradiated by Ar+-ion-assisted reaction
(IAR) method to form a strong CF/epoxy-matrix interface in the ﬁnal composite
system. The FT-IR spectra of the as-received and 0.8-keV Ar+-irradiated CFs are
shown in Fig. 4.10a. A new carbonyl peak was formed at 1,710 cm−1 and the range
of the −OH peak broadened. This affected the surface characteristics of the ﬁbers,
thereby resulting in an improvement in the interfacial adhesion between the ﬁbers
and matrix owing to an increase in the speciﬁc polarity and formation of H-bonding
by the CFs [102]. Figure 4.10b shows the experimental τmax values of the Ar+-ion
beam-irradiated single CF in the epoxy resins. It shows that the Ar+-ion beam
irradiation increases the τmax of the single CF up to 1.0 keV of Ar+-ion beam energy
followed by a small decrease. This was in good agreement with the results of the
surface analyses. In other words, the acidic functional groups on the CF surfaces
were more efﬁcient and reactive in undergoing an interfacial reaction with the
matrix materials [101].

4.4.2 Fluorination
Recently, several studies pertaining to the ﬂuorination of CFs have been published.
The degree of ﬂuorination depends on the nature of the ﬁbers and ﬂuorination
method used [115]. A large amount of the intercalated ﬂuorine could be obtained
using either well-graphitized structure or more extensive ﬂuorine treatment at
higher temperature and pressure. The reaction of ﬂuorine and graphite at low
temperature is kinetically hindered by the formation of covalent C–F bonds on the
outer surface, which prevents further migration of ﬂuorine into the interplanar
space, and thus further ﬂuorination [115–123]. The ﬂuorination of the CFs, in
particular the formation of graphite intercalation compounds or covalent and
insulating graphite ﬂuorides, (CF)n or (C2F)n, strongly inﬂuences the physical
properties such as layer structure and tensile and interfacial strength [115].

Park et al. [115] used different ﬂuorination methods to modify the surface
properties of the CFs. The relationship between the degree of ﬂuorination and
physicochemical properties of CFs was studied. The ﬂuorination reaction was
performed in a batch reactor made of nickel with an outer electric furnace, as shown
in Fig. 4.11a. After evacuation, ﬂuorine (F2) or ﬂuorine and oxygen mixture (F2/O2
mixture) were introduced into the reactor at room temperature, and then, the reactor
was heated to the treatment temperature. After the reaction, the sample was cooled
down to the room temperature, and then, the reactive gases were purged from the
reactor with nitrogen. In the case of the reaction at room temperature, the reactor
was cooled and evacuated in a cooling bath prior to charging ﬂuorine. The reactor
was removed from the cooling bath after purging ﬂuorine with nitrogen. The
ﬂuorine pressure was 0.1 MPa, and the nominal reaction time was 2 h at the
treatment temperature. Generally, highly oriented graphite reacts with ﬂuorine at
high temperatures (above 700 °C), with ﬂuorination of all the carbon layers, to yield
carbon tetraﬂuoride. Depending on the temperature, ﬂuorination leads to either
graphite ﬂuoride (CF)x or various other graphite ﬂuorides in the ideal case (addition
of F2 to all carbon–carbon double bonds) [115, 121]. Park et al. investigated the
direct ﬂuorination of the CFs using pure F2 and F2/O2 mixtures at different heat-
treatment temperatures [115]. A suggested mechanism of direct ﬂuorination of the
CFs is shown in Fig. 4.11b, c. Figure 4.12 shows the morphological properties of
the ﬂuorinated CFs. Mild ﬂuorination (F2 only) as well as aggressive ﬂuorination
(F2/O2 mixture) smoothened and changed the surface of the ﬁbers, which indicated
that the surface modiﬁcation by ﬂuorination took place, resulting in an enhance-
ment of the mechanical properties of the ﬂuorinated CFs.
4.4.3 Polymer Coating
Wei et al. [124] reported the grafting of polyesters onto the surfaces of the vapor-
grown carbon nanoﬁbers (VGCF) by the anionic ring-opening alternating copoly-
merization of epoxides with cyclic acid anhydrides initiated by COOK groups
introduced onto the VGCF surface. In addition, the electrical properties of the
conductive composites prepared from the polyester-grafted VGCF were investi-
gated. They investigated the stability of the dispersion of poly(SO-alt-PAn)-grafted
HDVGCF in THF. The untreated HDVGCF precipitated within 1 d as mentioned
above. On the contrary, poly(SO-alt-PAn)-grafted HDVGCF yielded a stable dis-
persion in a solvent, such as THF, suitable for grafted polyesters. The precipitation
of poly (SO-alt-PAn)-grafted HDVGCF was scarcely observed even after 4 weeks.
The grafted polyester chains were mainly grafted onto the edges of VGCF because
of the presence of the carboxyl groups on the edges. However, it seemed that the
grafting of the polyester onto the wall of the VGCF had also proceeded. Both
polyester chains on the edges and wall of VGCF played an important role in the
destruction the entanglement [123].

4.4.4 Grafting with Inorganic Materials
Recently, the surfaces of the CFs have been modiﬁed with inorganic materials such
as silica, metals, and carbon nanomaterials [124–127]. Deng et al. [124] prepared
the two-dimensional ultrathin mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanosheets on the CF paper
(CFP) through a facile solvothermal method combined with post-thermal treatment.
The well-interconnected ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanosheets directly grown on the car-
bon nanoﬁbers would allow for easy diffusion of the electrolyte, shorten the
transport path of ions and electrons, and accommodate the strain during cycling.
The Ni–Co precursor nanosheets were uniformly grown on the carbon nanoﬁbers,
forming
a

coating.
Moreover,

interconnected with each other to form a wall-like structure, which possessed good
mechanical strength. After annealing at a relatively low temperature of 350 °C for
3 h with a slow heating rate of 1 °C min−1, these Ni–Co precursor nanosheets could
be easily converted to crystalline NiCo2O4. Importantly, the well-interconnected
ultrathin nanosheet morphology was perfectly retained after the annealing treat-
ment, which could be attributed to the robust support of the carbon nanoﬁbers and
the slow heating rate applied during the annealing [124].
Waller et al. [125] reported a low-temperature hydrothermal process for the
growth of the conformal coatings of highly crystalline LiMn2O4 directly onto a CF
current collector, thereby completely eliminating the process steps and materials
associated with the conventional tape-casting approach (binders, solvents, and
metal foils). The resulting electrodes tested at a rate of 1 C showed an initial
discharge capacity of 125 mAh g−1 and an average energy efﬁciency of 92.4 % over
100 cycles. At the hydrothermal temperature of 100 °C, a conformal coating with a
ﬂower-like morphology was observed using SEM. The “ﬂowers” had “petals,”
which were a few tens of nanometers thick. The coatings produced at 140 °C and
above were coated with a layer of discrete multifaceted crystallites, over the size
range 50–500 nm. These coatings showed thickness of approximately 2 μm, with
nodules protruding beyond this threshold in certain parts, which were also observed
in the ﬂower-like coatings [125].
Du et al. [126] prepared a novel and sensitive CF electrode (CFE) modiﬁed with
graphene ﬂowers and used to simultaneously determine ascorbic acid (AA),
dopamine (DA), and uric acid (UA). They found that the layered petal graphene
ﬂowers homogeneously bloomed on the surface of the CFE. Moreover, sharp and
obvious oxidation peaks were found at the resultant electrode, in contrast with the
CFE and glassy carbon electrode (GCE), for the oxidation of AA, DA, and UA.
Also, the linear calibration plots for AA, DA, and UA were observed, respectively,
over the ranges 45.4–1,489.23, 0.7–45.21, and 3.78–183.87 μM. By simultaneously
changing the concentrations of AA, DA, and UA, their oxidation peaks appeared at
−0.05, 0.16, and 2.6 V, and the good linear response ranges were found to be
73.52–2,305.53, 1.36–125.69, and 3.98–371.49 μM, respectively. In addition, the
resultant electrode showed satisfactory results when employed for the determination
of AA, DA, and UA in urine and serum samples [126].
Shazed et al. [127] prepared the growing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the
surface of the high-performance CFs. The growth of the CNT on CF was conducted
via ﬂoating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (CVD). CNT was vigorously grown
on the surface of the CF at 800 and 700 °C. The high density of CNT was desirable
owing to the purpose of the production of high-performance ﬁber-reinforced
composites. However, the coatings were found to be more uniform with minimal
clumping and agglomeration at 700 °C. It was deduced that under the given
experimental conditions, higher temperature led to a higher degree of catalyst
agglomeration, which affected the homogeneous growth of the CNT. Furthermore,
a lower synthesis temperature was desirable to minimize the heating energy and
protect the CF from being damaged by unnecessarily high heat levels. The growth

of CNTs was of the multiwalled type. After 30 min of reaction time, it could be
seen that a coating with an apparent thickness of 3 μm had been established [127].
4.5 Sizing
The commercially available CFs are normally coated by a sizing layer on the
surface, which usually is either a solution or emulsion consisting of polymeric
components. The presence of sizing in the CFs/sizing and sizing/matrix interfaces
plays an important role in controlling certain properties of the composites
[128–130]. Conventional sizing such as ﬁlm formers, emulsiﬁers, antistatic, and
coupling agents is generally designed to protect the ﬁber surface and promote the
adhesion between the ﬁber and matrix [131–137]. The sizing could alter the han-
dling of the CFs, which includes protection, alignment, and wettability of ﬁbers.
The typical sizing materials include epoxy, polyester, nylon, urethane, and others.
Table 4.8 lists the major components involved in typical sizing and, in brief terms,
the major purpose of each component.
The application of sizing is normally termed either size or ﬁnish and could be
achieved by:
• deposition from solution of a polymer
• deposition of a polymer onto ﬁber surface by electrodeposition
• deposition of a polymer onto ﬁber surface by electropolymerization
• plasma polymerization
Zhang et al. [128] prepared the CFs sized with three different amounts of the
emulsiﬁer in the sizing agent in order to improve the performances of CFs and
interfaces of CF composites. The sizing agents, E-1, E-2, and E-3, based on the
three different amounts of the emulsiﬁer contained therein, 10, 15, and 20 wt%,
respectively, were used [128, 129]. The content of the sizing agent used for the CFs
in the research is 1.5 %. The sizing agent phase between the carbon ﬁber and resin
was important; based on the results of the present study, the emulsiﬁer content of
the sizing agent affected the IFSS of the composites. The IFSS of the sizing agents,

Surface Treatment and Sizing of Carbon Fibers

E-2- and E-3-sized carbon ﬁber composites, were enhanced by 4.6 and 8.6 %,
respectively, compared to the E-1-sized carbon ﬁber composites. For the E-3-sized
carbon ﬁber/epoxy-matrix system, with the same resin matrix and technological
conditions, high emulsiﬁer content of the sizing agent E-3 could appreciably help to
enhance the interface bonding strength. This could result in better mechanical
performance than those of the other two composite systems [128].
Recently, sizing agents containing CNTs were used to size the glass ﬁbers or
fabrics in order to improve the mechanical or electrical properties of glass ﬁber
composites [134, 138]. Liu et al. [138] disclosed a sizing approach to fabricate the
CNT/CF-hybrid ﬁber in detail by employing a sizing agent containing MWCNTs.
MWCNTs were chemically modiﬁed with an amine monomer and mixed with a
thermoplastic polymer sizing agent. After the modiﬁcation, the MWCNTs were
uniformly dispersed in the sizing agent. Unsized CF tow was sized using the sizing
agents containing MWCNT, while the CNT/CF-hybrid ﬁber was fabricated. The
MWCNT–COOH was reacted with phthalazinone-containing diamine (DHPZDA)
in dimethyl formamide (DMF) at 130 °C followed by the addition of dicyclohex-
ylcarbodiimide over 6 h under uninterrupted stirring to introduce the amine
monomer on the surfaces of the MWCNTs (marked as MWCNT–DHPZDA). It was
found that the CNTs were attached to the ﬁber surface along the outer edges of the
grooves and a hierarchical structure was observed in all the images. It was also
observed that there were wide and deep grooves along the axial direction of the CFs
before and after sizing. This indicated that the PPEK absorption did not ﬁll the
grooves on the ﬁber surface because of the nano-sized thickness of the sizing agent
layer [138].
In manufacturing companies, CFs are generally sized or coated with various
polymers in order to protect the ﬁbers and make handling easier after the surface
oxidation treatment. Remarkably, it has been found that the sizing also plays an
important role in improving the interfacial adhesion between the ﬁbers and matrix
[139]. Yuan et al. prepared an organic solvent-free polyamic acid (PAA) nano-
emulsion by direct ionization of the solid PAA in deionized water, with an average
particle size of 261 nm and zeta potential of −55.1 mV. The nanoemulsion was
used for CF sizing to improve the interfacial adhesion between the CF and poly-
ether sulfone (PES) [140]. A continuous and uniform PAA sizing layer was formed
on the surfaces of CFs, and the surface energy of the CFs increased from 42.91 to
54.55 mN/m after the sizing treatment. The single ﬁber pull-out testing was also
performed, which showed a 47.9 % increase in the interfacial shear strength (IFSS)
of the CF/PES composites, from 33.6 to 49.7 MPa. The primary reasons for the
improved interfacial adhesion were the increased van der Waals forces between the
PES matrix and sizing layer, and the chemical bonding between the sizing layer and
CF surface. Furthermore, the PAA sizing positively affected the interfacial adhesion
of the CF/PES composites under hydrothermal conditions [140].
Cao [141] investigated a heat-resistant sizing agent composed of thermoplastic
polyimide and thermosetting epoxy for PAN-based CFs. The sized ﬁbers were
reported to possess an improved wear resistance and 97 % improvement in the

interfacial shear strength compared to the unsized ﬁbers. However, not all types of
sizing could improve the interfacial adhesion between the ﬁbers and matrix resins.
Dilsiz found that the polyimide- and polyurethane-sized ﬁbers in an epoxy matrix
showed lower interfacial shear strength compared to the unsized ﬁbers, from the
single ﬁber fragmentation test. This was attributed to the effect of the surface
chemical changes on the ﬁber/matrix adhesion [142]. Interfacial adhesion was
expected to be dependent on the surface properties of the ﬁber, including rough-
ness, porosity, and functional groups; it is also dependent on the chemical char-
acteristics of the matrix [143]. Dai et al. [144] evaluated the inﬂuence of sizing on
the interfacial adhesion of the CF/matrix. Desized CFs (T300B and T700SC) were
prepared by extracting the sizing on the ﬁber surface and comparing the CFs with
those sized commercially. Also, the surface properties of the CFs, including the
chemical compositions, surface free energy, acid–base interactions, dispersive
components, and polar components, were experimentally characterized. Besides,
the adhesion between the CFs and solid epoxy resins was also evaluated with
respect to the IFSS, in order to determine the primary factors responsible for the
ﬁber/matrix interfacial adhesion [141].
Recently, the use of nanoparticles such as nano-SiO2, nano-Al2O3, and nano-
TiO2 for modifying the mechanical interfacial properties of composites has been
reviewed by several researchers [145–150]. On the basis of the signiﬁcant effects of
sizing on the interfacial properties of the composites, we selected inorganic nano-
SiO2 to modify the emulsion sizing of CFs so as to increase the extent of the
interfacial adhesion of the CFs/epoxy composites. Yang et al. [150] used nano-SiO2
particles to modify the epoxy emulsion sizing of the CFs in order to improve the
interfacial properties of the CF-reinforced epoxy composites. The results indicated
that the modiﬁed sizing with nano-SiO2 slightly increased the surface energy,
number of hydroxyl functional groups, and surface roughness of CFs compared to
the unmodiﬁed sizing. Consequently, the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) of the
single ﬁber composites and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of composites were
enhanced. The SEM images of the fractured sections of the composites conﬁrmed
that the interfacial adhesion between the ﬁbers and matrix improved after the sizing
treatment with the nano-SiO2-modiﬁed emulsion.
Toray Industries, Inc. of Japan is recognized as the worldwide leader in the CF
industry, having pioneered the development of PAN-based CFs over 30 years ago.
Toray’s TORAYCA® brand of CFs is globally recognized for its outstanding
performance, quality, and processing consistency, thereby making the TORAYCA®
brand the preferred choice of designers, engineers, and fabricators worldwide.
TORAYCA® CFs are critical for modern aviation and aerospace applications,
including for the primary and secondary structures for Boeing and Airbus com-
mercial aircrafts, International Space Station, satellites, rocket motor casings, and
expendable launch vehicles such as Boeing Delta programs. TORAYCA® T800 CF
is the only CF that has attained the certiﬁcation from the FAA for the critical
ﬂight–path components for Boeing 777 [151]. TORAYCA ﬁbers were treated with
various sizing agents to enhance the handling and bonding characteristics with

various resin systems. Listed below are the sizing types developed for the TO-
RAYCA ﬁbers. Not all the sizings were available with every ﬁber. The data
available for the sizing of a particular ﬁber are listed in Tables 4.9 and 4.10 [151].
The importance of CF-based composites has rapidly increased since the 1960s.
The CFs are primarily designed for high-strength structural applications and widely
used in the aircraft, defense, catalyst, cell, and sports industries owing to their
excellent properties. The wettability of the pristine CFs might negatively affect the
physical and mechanical properties of the resulting composites because of the
surface incompatibility between the hydrophilic inorganic ﬁllers of the carbon ﬁber
and nonpolar resin. Therefore, the main purpose of this chapter was to review the
surface treatment and surface wettability of CF surfaces. Accordingly, a variety of
surface-treatment methods have been applied to modify the surfaces of CFs to
promote the interfacial adhesion and improve the properties of the composites.
These methods include oxidation, electrochemical and plasma treatments, ﬂuori-
nation, and electron-beam irradiation pretreatment.

Chapter 5
Testing of Carbon Fibers and Their
Composites
Soo-Jin Park and Kyong-Min Bae
Abstract In this chapter, we will introduce an evaluation of carbon ﬁbers and their
composites with various analyses. The major types of methods of characterization
techniques that work best for carbon ﬁbers and their composite materials to
understand their properties such as chemical, physical, and mechanical properties
and advanced characterization methods for surface or morphology analyses, such as
transmission electron microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and atomic force
microscopy will be described. In addition, a concise summary of all the major
characterization methodologies used on composite materials will be presented.
5.1 Introduction
Composite materials have made their way into every aspect of the modern tech-
nological society, particularly in applications requiring high strength and low
weight, speciﬁcally in the aerospace industry. Because composites are hybrid
heterogeneous materials, they can be difﬁcult to characterize by a single method-
ology. In this chapter, (1) the major types of methods of characterization techniques
that work best for composite materials to understand their properties such as
chemical, physical, and mechanical properties, and (2) advanced characterization
methods for surface or morphology analyses, such as transmission electron
microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and atomic force microscopy will be
described. Finally, a concise summary of all the major characterization methodol-
ogies used on composite materials will be presented.

5.2 Evaluation of Carbon Fibers
5.2.1 Introduction
In this section, we describe the techniques and methods that are generally used to
characterize the properties of carbon ﬁbers for application in composite materials.
Sophisticated experimental techniques are required for ﬁber characterization and
test laboratories must be well equipped for measuring the ﬁber properties. It is also
recognized that in many cases, the measurement of a ﬁber property that manifests
itself in the reinforced composite can best be accomplished by measuring the
properties of the composites.
5.2.2 Elemental Analysis
In elemental analysis, a sample of some material (e.g., soil, waste or drinking water,
bodily ﬂuids, minerals, and chemical compounds) is analyzed for its elemental and,
occasionally, the isotopic composition. A variety of quantitative wet gravimetric
and spectroscopic chemical analysis techniques may be applied to analyze the
compositions of and the presence of trace elements in ﬁbers [1–4].
A suitable standardized method for carbon and hydrogen analysis, modiﬁed to
handle carbon and polymeric ﬁbers, is provided by the ASTM test method D3178 [5].
Carbon and hydrogen concentrations are determined by burning a preweighed
quantity of the sample in a closed system and ﬁxing the products of combustion in an
absorption train after complete oxidation and puriﬁcation from interfering substances.
Carbon and hydrogen concentrations are expressed as percentages of the total
dry weight of the ﬁber. The ASTM test method D3174 [6] describes a related test in
which metallic impurities may be determined by the analysis of the ash residue.
Li et al. [2] investigated the feasibility of activating vapor-grown carbon ﬁbers
(VGCFs) with supercritical ﬂuids (SCFs). The quantitative analysis of the VGCFs
by elemental analysis is shown in Table 5.1. The original VGCF (VGCF0) contains
highly pure carbon-containing material, which consists of 97.3 % carbon, 0.08 %
hydrogen, and 0.22 % nitrogen by weight. All the treated VGCFs showed the
absence of any signiﬁcant changes in terms of hydrogen and nitrogen; however, in
VGCF3, 4, and 5, other elements such as oxygen or contaminants from the cor-
rosion of the reactor were present in signiﬁcant amounts.

5.2.3 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), also known as electron spectroscopy for
chemical analysis (ESCA), is the most widely contemporary surface characteriza-
tion method [7, 8]. Large amount of information can be acquired from each
spectrum (Table 5.2), and the technique is ﬂexible enough to be used on a large
variety of sample types.
Each atom on the surface of a material (except for hydrogen) consists of valence
electrons, which are involved in chemical bonding, in addition to core electrons.
These core electrons possess a unique binding energy, which is characteristic of the
type of atom to which it is bound. By analyzing the binding energies of the
electrons and the peak areas, quantitative elemental surface analysis is possible [2].
Because the electrons can only travel a short distance through the sample
without undergoing inelastic collisions resulting in a drastic loss of energy, XPS is
considered to be highly surface sensitive. Usually, only 50–100 Å of the sample
surface is analyzed using this technique [2, 8].
Surface analysis by XPS begins by placing the sample in an ultrahigh vacuum
environment (*10−10 Torr) and then irradiating the material with a source of low-
energy X-rays. If the frequency of the excitation X-rays are greater than the binding
energy of each element, photoemission will occur. Schematics of the processes,
which occur during XPS are shown in Figs. 5.1 and 5.2 [7, 8].
The resulting photoelectrons are emitted from the surface with kinetic energy
(Ek) measured by a hemispheric analyzer. Using the incident X-ray energy (hv), the
binding energy (Eb) is calculated using Einstein’s relationship given in (5.1) [3, 7,
8], where ϕ is the work function of the spectrometer.
Eb ¼ hm  Ek  /
ð5:1Þ
The photoelectrons are then separated according to their energy, counted, and
related to the atomic and molecular environment from which they were ejected. A
spectrum of the number of emitted electrons versus binding energy is obtained.

Evaluation of Carbon Fibers

Speciﬁc electrons of an atom have certain binding energies; however, the
chemical environment of the atom can create variations in the values. These
changes in the energy values, or chemical shifts, represent the presence of covalent
or ionic bonds between atoms and help deduce the chemical structure of the
material surface. Some common binding energy peak assignments for the carbon 1s
peak and the oxygen 1s peak are seen in Tables 5.3 and 5.4 [3, 7, 8].
Various researchers have explored curve ﬁtting approaches with a vast majority
of the studies concentrating on core spectrum studies. Over 250 papers have
addressed the curve ﬁtting area and hence, only a brief description of the type of
information that can be obtained by XPS will be presented here. A complete review
of the curve ﬁtting approach can be found in papers referenced by Sherwood [1].
Wang and Sherwood [9] showed that XPS can be used to reveal the interfacial
chemistry in the carbon ﬁber matrix system. The use of propionaldehyde under

dation monitored by thermogravimetric analysis shows that the cross-linked sam-
ples exhibit enhanced oxidation resistance.
In Fig. 5.3, the XPS proﬁle of the Cls region of a carbon ﬁber electrochemically
oxidized in phosphoric acid and subsequently treated with acidiﬁed PAL is pre-
sented. The separations between the component peaks are compared with the
separations calculated from an ab initio calculation [9].
Previous work by researchers on the highly resolved core carbon 1s spectrum of
untreated carbon ﬁbers showed the different bonds of carbon, where the main
component peak (the lowest binding energy peak) corresponded to the carbon ﬁber
and C=C bonds. Other carbon bonds were identiﬁed by higher binding energy
features corresponding to oxidation, i.e., alcohol (C–OH), carbonyl (C=O), and
carboxyl (COO) and to amino C–N (Fig. 5.4).

of natural and manufactured materials. A crystal lattice is a regular three-dimen-
sional distribution (e.g., cubic and rhombic) of atoms in space. The lattices are
arranged such that they form a series of parallel planes separated from one another
by distance d, which varies with the nature of the material. For any crystal, planes
exist in a number of different orientations, each with its own speciﬁc d-spacing.
By varying the angle theta, the Bragg’s Law conditions are satisﬁed by differ-
ent d-spacings in polycrystalline materials. Plotting the angular positions and
intensities of the resultant diffracted peaks of radiation produces a pattern, which is
characteristic of the sample. When a mixture of different phases is present, the
resultant diffractogram is formed by the addition of the individual patterns.
Using the principles of XRD, a wealth of structural, physical, and chemical
information about the material investigated can be obtained. A host of XRD
techniques is available for various classes of materials, each revealing its own
speciﬁc details of the sample studied.
Iwashita et al. [10] investigated the application of a standard procedure of XRD
measurements on carbon materials. The various peaks include the one near 29°
corresponding to the 002 reﬂection, near 57° corresponding to the 004 reﬂection,
the one near 75° corresponding to the 110 reﬂection, and the one near 89° corre-
sponding to the 112 reﬂection, as shown in Fig. 5.5, respectively.
5.2.5 Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy is a laser-based method using inelastically scattered light to
investigate the vibrational, rotational, and other low-frequency modes of interaction
between molecules. Raman bands are sharp peaks in the spectra that can be asso-
ciated with vibration modes at the molecular level. Early studies on graphitic
materials revealed that a Raman band at *1,585 cm−1 can be related to C–C
vibrations in graphite and is present in all carbon ﬁbers. Another band in

polycrystalline graphite was found at *1,330 cm−1 and can be related to the
boundaries of the graphite crystals. Thus, this peak could be related to the particle
size and structural disorder effects (Figs. 5.6 and 5.7) [11, 12].
5.2.6 Auger Electron Spectroscopy
An alternative method for chemical surface analysis is Auger electron spectroscopy
(AES). During bombardment of the surface under investigation with a beam of

electrons in the energy range 1–5 keV, vacancies are created in the core level. These
vacancies represent excited ions in the surface region, which may undergo de-
excitation, resulting in the creation of Auger electrons. Each electron has energy
characteristic to a speciﬁc element. By analyzing all back-scattered Auger electrons
in the energy range 0–1 keV, a complete picture of the elemental composition of the
outermost atomic layers is obtained. The surface sensitivity originates from the fact
that the escape depth of electrons in the energy range 50–1,000 eV is between 0.5
and 1.5 nm. In recent years, AES is widely used in the ﬁelds of corrosion, catalysis,
metallurgy, thin-ﬁlm devices, and tribology [13].
5.2.7 Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM)
STM is based on quantum tunneling. When a conducting tip is brought in close
proximity to the surface to be examined, a bias (voltage difference) applied between
the two can allow electrons to tunnel through the vacuum between them. The
resulting tunneling current is a function of the tip position, applied voltage, and the
local density of states (LDOS) of the sample. Information is acquired by monitoring
the current as the tip scans across the surface and the data are usually displayed in
the form of an image. STM can be a challenging technique because it requires
extremely clean and stable surfaces, sharp tips, excellent vibration control, and
sophisticated electronics; nonetheless, many scientists have built their own STMs
[14, 15].
Paredes et al. [15] investigated the surface modiﬁcation of ultrahigh modulus
carbon ﬁbers by STM. Representative atomic-scale STM images of the fresh
untreated material are presented in Fig. 5.8. In Fig. 5.8a, for example, the triangular
atomic-scale pattern, typical to the STM images of the pristine graphite basal plane,
can be identiﬁed. Undulations in the topography can be observed in Fig. 5.8b.

untreated ﬁber surface. Atomic-sized spots can be distinctly perceived in this
image; however, their arrangement differs from that of perfect graphite both in the
long range (as observed in Fig. 5.8a) as well as locally (as in Fig. 5.8b).
5.2.8 Atomic Force Microscopy
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) or scanning force microscopy (SFM) is a very
high-resolution scanning probe microscopy, which allows for characterization at
resolutions on the order of fractions of a nanometer, which is more than 1,000 times
better than the optical diffraction limit. The precursor to the AFM, the scanning

tunneling microscope, was developed by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer in the
early 1980s at IBM Research laboratory, Zurich, which earned them the Nobel
Prize for Physics in 1986. Binnig, Quate, and Gerber invented the ﬁrst AFM in
1986. The ﬁrst commercially available AFM was introduced in 1989. The AFM is
one of the foremost tools for imaging, measuring, and manipulating matter at the
nanoscale (Figs. 5.9 and 5.10) [16, 17].
Smiley and Delgass used AFM to investigate the topographical changes of
carbon ﬁbers exposed to low-temperature low-power oxygen plasma treatments
(Figs. 5.11 and 5.12) [17]. Through their research, it was found that the grooves
present in the AFM images of untreated ﬁbers were the same as those seen by the
SEM. The axial grooves were unevenly spaced by approximately 40–120 nm apart
and showed a depth distribution ranging from 1 to 7 nm. The ﬁbers treated with

oxygen plasma for 2 and 15 min were also imaged by AFM. It was found that the
ﬁber surfaces go through an initial roughening after the short treatment, followed by
an overall smoothening with increase in the treatment time.
5.2.9 Titration
The potential chemical activity of surface groups on ﬁbers may be determined by
titration techniques. For example, the relative concentration of hydrolyzable groups
introduced during the manufacturing or posttreatment of carbon ﬁbers may be

Testing of Carbon Fibers and Their Composites

determined by measuring the pH. However, titration techniques are typically not
used on commercial carbon ﬁbers because of the low levels of surface functional
groups present.
5.2.10 Moisture Content
The moisture content or moisture regains of ﬁbers or textiles may be determined
using common methods. Care must be exercised when applying the procedure
because volatile materials in addition to moisture may also be removed. If possible,
tests should be performed on ﬁbers that have not been sized. Moisture content is
expressed as weight percentage moisture based on the dry weight of the specimen
(Fig. 5.13).
5.2.11 Thermal Stability and Oxidative Resistance
The susceptibility of ﬁbers and ﬁber surfaces to undergo oxidation is measured as
the weight loss under speciﬁc conditions of time, temperature, and atmosphere.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is a process that uses heat and stoichiometry
ratios to determine the percent by mass of the various components. Analysis is
carried out by raising the temperature of the sample gradually and plotting the
weight (percentage) against temperature. The temperature in many testing methods
routinely reaches 1,000 °C or greater. After the data are obtained, curve smoothing
and other operations may be carried out to ﬁnd the exact points of inﬂection.
High-resolution TGA is often employed to obtain greater accuracy in areas at
which the derivative curve peaks. In this method, the temperature increase slows as

weight loss increases. This is done to more accurately identify the exact temperature
at which a peak occurs. Several modern TGA devices can vent burnoff to an
infrared spectrophotometer to analyze the gas composition (Table 5.5).
5.2.12 Filament Diameter
Perfect graphite has three-dimensional periodicity and belongs to the hexagonal
crystal system. However, Johnson [31] reported that face-centered cubic sequence is
also observed. In carbon ﬁbers, within each basal plane of aromatic rings, the carbon
atoms are placed on a hexagonal lattice, but the corresponding atoms on an adjacent
plane may be translated by an arbitrary displacement. Hence, carbon ﬁbers generally
have only two-dimensional order referred to as “turbostratic” structure [32]. Inter-
planar spacing in carbon ﬁbers processed even at higher temperatures is signiﬁcantly
higher than that of perfect graphite. However, many researchers [33–36] have
reported the evidence of three-dimensional order in certain carbon ﬁbers. Kumar
et al. [33] have reported that most PAN-based carbon ﬁbers exhibit a particulate
morphology, whereas pitch-based carbon ﬁbers exhibit a sheet-like morphology.
They also reported that a sheet-like morphology does not necessarily imply a three-
dimensional order; on the other hand, a ﬁber with particulate morphology can dis-
play three-dimensional order. Rayon-based ﬁbers show particulate morphology and
may show three-dimensional order. SEM images of PAN-based, pitch-based, and
rayon-based carbon ﬁbers are shown in Figs. 5.14, 5.15 and 5.16 [33], respectively.
Extensive graphitized small areas have been observed to exist even in ﬁbers,
which have never been exposed to temperatures beyond 1,100 °C [34]. Preferential
orientation of graphitic sheets along the ﬁber axis increases with heat-treatment
temperature. The orientation and size of these sheets are greater on the surface than
in the interior of the carbon ﬁbers [33, 34]. The modulus of the ﬁbers increases with
increase in orientation [34]. Carbon ﬁbers are reported to consist of up to 20 %
voids elongated in along the ﬁber axis [32]. There is a transition from many small
pores to fewer larger pores with an increase in the heat-treatment temperature [35].
PAN-based carbon ﬁbers show higher tensile and compressive strengths than
pitch-based carbon ﬁbers because PAN-based ﬁbers consist of particle-like struc-
tures and smaller crystals in comparison with the sheet-like structure and larger
crystals in pitch-based ﬁbers [35–40]. The cross-sectional structure of carbon ﬁbers
also plays an important role in determining the compressive properties of carbon
ﬁbers. Hayes et al. [36] studied the compressive behavior of two different pitch-
based carbon ﬁbers and proposed that ﬁbers with a folded radial texture show
higher compressive strengths than ﬁbers with a ﬂat-layer structure. The two
structures have been reproduced in Fig. 5.17 [36]. Knibbs [41] identiﬁed three
different types of structures for PAN-based carbon ﬁbers prepared under different
processing conditions. The three structures are schematically represented in
Fig. 5.18 [34]. The transverse structure of the ﬁnal carbon ﬁbers depends very much
upon the type of spinning process used, the temperature of spinning, the shape of

is independent of the heat-treatment temperature [34].
5.2.13 Electrical Resistivity
The presence of an electric ﬁeld inside a material will cause the ﬂow of an electric
current. The electrical resistivity (ρ, Ω/m) is deﬁned as the ratio of the electric ﬁeld
(E, V/m) to the current density (J, A/m2) generated.

Fig. 5.19. The speciﬁc resistance was observed to decrease with increase in plating
time. Also, while the speciﬁc resistivity of the as-received sample was higher than
0.80 × 10−3 Ω cm, the value decreased dramatically with increase in plating time to
up to 60 s. From the good linearity of results in the range 5–30 s, there seems to be a
strong correlation between the electric conductivity and the plating time.
5.2.14 Coefﬁcient of Thermal Expansion
The coefﬁcient of thermal expansion describes how the size of an object changes
with change in temperature and the value represents the fractional change in size per
degree change in temperature at a constant pressure. Several types of thermal
expansion coefﬁcients, including volumetric, area, and linear, have been developed.
The type of coefﬁcient used depends on the particular application and the

dimensions, which are considered important. For solids, one might only be con-
cerned with the change along a length or over some area.
Korab et al. [44] investigated the thermal expansion of cross-ply and woven
carbon ﬁber–copper matrix composites. The in-plane thermal expansion behaviors
of the cross-ply samples with and without copper foils are compared in Fig. 5.20.
Samples were oriented in such a way that in three layers, ﬁbers were parallel, and in
two layers, the ﬁbers were perpendicular to the direction of measurement. The in-
plane response of the cross-ply composites is qualitatively similar to the axial
response of the unidirectional specimens. Curves showed hysteresis between the
heating and cooling parts of the loop, which could be ascribed to the plastic
deformation of the copper matrix at higher temperatures. Further, in the case of the
sample with copper foil (50 % Cf), the ﬁrst loop was not closed, while in the case of
the sample without copper foils (57 % Cf), all three loops were closed.
5.2.15 Thermal Conductivity
Heat transfer across materials with high thermal conductivity occurs at a higher rate
than across materials with low thermal conductivity. Correspondingly, materials
with high thermal conductivity are widely used in heat sink applications and
materials with low thermal conductivity are used as thermal insulation. Thermal
conductivity of materials is temperature dependent. The reciprocal of thermal
conductivity is thermal resistivity.
Karaipekli et al. [45] investigated the improvement in the thermal conductivity
of stearic acid using expanded graphite and carbon ﬁber additives. Figure 5.21
shows the variation of thermal conductivity of stearic acid/expanded graphite and
the steric acid/carbon ﬁber composite phase change materials with different mass

fractions of expanded graphite and carbon ﬁbers. As clearly seen from these results,
the thermal conductivity of steric acid increased with increase in the mass fraction
of expanded graphite and carbon ﬁbers.
5.2.16 Speciﬁc Heat
Speciﬁc heat is measured in a calorimeter such as that described in ASTM test
method D2766 [46]. The measurement of speciﬁc heat is complex and is best left to
experienced laboratories.

and if the ﬁber is semicrystalline, its crystalline melting temperature (Tm) can be
measured. The general procedures for measuring Tg and Tm of organic ﬁbers are
provided in ASTM test methods D3417 and D3418 [47, 48].
5.2.18 Tensile Properties
Tensile properties are a measure of the maximum stress that a material can with-
stand while being stretched or pulled before necking, which is when the specimen’s
cross section begins to signiﬁcantly contract. Tensile strength is the opposite of

compressive strength and the values can be quite different. Tensile strength is
deﬁned as stress that is measured as force per unit area. For some non-homoge-
neous materials (or for assembled components), it can be reported simply as a force
or as a force per unit width. In the SI system, the unit is pascal (Pa) [or a multiple
thereof, often megapascals (MPa)] or, equivalently, Newton per square meter (N/
m2). The customary unit is pound-force per square inch (lbf/in.2 or psi) or kilo-
pounds per square inch (ksi, or sometimes kpsi), which is equal to 1,000 psi. When
measuring tensile strengths, ksi is commonly used for convenience.
5.3 Evaluation of Composites
5.3.1 Introduction
The function of the matrix in a composite is to hold the ﬁbers in the desired position
and to provide a path for introducing external loads into the ﬁbers. Because the
strengths of the matrix materials are generally lower than the ﬁber strengths by an
order of magnitude or more, it is desirable to orient the ﬁbers within a composite
structure so that the ﬁbers will carry the major external loads. Although the success
of a composite largely relies on this, the strength and other properties of matrix
materials cannot be ignored. Matrix material properties can signiﬁcantly affect how
a composite will perform, particularly with respect to in-plane compression, in-
plane shear, resistance to impact damage, and other interlaminar behaviors, and
especially when exposed to moisture and elevated temperatures.
This section focuses on methods of testing and evaluating matrix materials and
their constituents. Chemical, physical, thermal, and mechanical properties are
considered, in addition to methods for test specimen preparation and environmental
conditioning of the test specimens.
5.3.2 Coefﬁcient of Thermal Expansion
The thermal expansion of composite materials is an important design parameter in
cryogenic technology. A large range of expansion can be achieved by varying the
ﬁber type, content, and arrangement and the matrix. Generally, the thermal
expansion of composite materials is anisotropic. For carbon ﬁber composites, the
anisotropy results not only from the ﬁber arrangement but also from the ﬁber
anisotropy. Carbon ﬁbers show a small negative coefﬁcient of thermal expansion in
the ﬁber direction and a large positive coefﬁcient perpendicular to it. For angle-plies
the stresses, thermally induced between layers, strongly inﬂuence the thermal
expansion behavior. In many cases, it is possible to match the thermal expansion of
ﬁber composites to their application at least in one direction, and it should be noted
156
5
Testing of Carbon Fibers and Their Composites

that often the same thermal expansion can be achieved by two or more different
ﬁber arrangements. The solution with the lowest internal stresses is favored. At a
ﬁber angle of ±30°, thermally induced stresses induce a negative expansion coef-
ﬁcient for carbon ﬁber composites. This might be useful for compensating the
thermal expansion of different materials [49].
5.3.3 Thermal Conductivity
The thermal conductivity of metals, alloys, or composites with = 0, 2,…, 100 W/mK
can be measured by comparative method with steady-state longitudinal heat ﬂow
from room temperature to up to approximately 1,000 °C. The comparative instru-
ment measures heat ﬂow based on the known thermal properties of standard refer-
ence materials. The test specimen is sandwiched between two identical reference
samples. This stack is placed between two heating elements controlled at different
temperatures. A guard heater is placed around the test stack to ensure a constant heat
ﬂux through the stack and to eliminate lateral heat ﬂow losses. As heat ﬂows from
the hot element to the cold element, the temperature gradient (T/L) across the stack is
measured with thermocouples. Once the specimen reaches a state of thermal equi-
librium, its thermal conductivity is calculated from the following expression:
k ¼ LQ
ADT
ð5:3Þ
In the above equation, Q is the heating power of the heater. The experimental
error is in the range of approximately ±10 %. The specimen geometry is cylindrical
(with a diameter of 25 or 50 mm and a height of approximately 10–40 mm).
Shim et al. [50] investigated the thermal conductivity of carbon ﬁber-reinforced
composites with various types of cross sections. Figure 5.22a, b shows the thermal
conductivity of the carbon ﬁber-reinforced composites in the directions parallel and
perpendicular to the reinforcement direction, respectively, as a function of the ﬁber
mass fraction. From the ﬁgures, we can see that the thermal conductivity of the
composites depends on three parameters, i.e., measurement temperature, ﬁber
content, and type of ﬁber cross section. C-CF/EP (C-type carbon ﬁber-reinforced
epoxy composites), in particular, shows the highest value of thermal conductivity in
a direction parallel direction to the ﬁber, k//, while H-CF/EP (hollow-type carbon
ﬁber-reinforced epoxy composites) shows the lowest value of thermal conductivity
in the transverse direction to the ﬁber, k⊥. The difference between k(//, 120 °C) and
k(//, 40 °C) of C-CF/EP is relatively larger than that of R-CF/EP and C-CF/EP,
while the difference between k(⊥, 120 °C) and k(⊥, 40 °C) of R-CF/EP is relatively
larger than that of C-CF/EP and H-CF/EP.

5.3.4 Poisson’s Ratio
There is very limited information available on the Poisson’s ratio of ﬁber-reinforced
concrete. In most analytical studies, the Poisson’s ratio is generally assumed to be
the same as that of concrete. This may be a reasonable assumption provided the
composite remains in the elastic range of behavior. As soon as cracking occurs, the
conﬁning effects of the ﬁbers bridging the cracks will have a signiﬁcant effect on
the lateral deformation, and thus, the value of the measured Poisson’s ratio will be
affected. To the best of our knowledge, no investigation is known to have addressed
this issue.

5.3.5 Rheological Analysis
Newtonian ﬂuids can be characterized by a single coefﬁcient of viscosity for a
speciﬁc temperature. However, this viscosity will change with temperature,
although it does not change with the ﬂow rate or strain rate. Only a small group of
ﬂuids exhibit such constant viscosity and are known as Newtonian ﬂuids. However,
for a large class of ﬂuids, the viscosity changes with the strain rate (or relative
velocity of ﬂow) and the ﬂuids are termed as non-Newtonian ﬂuids. Rheology
generally accounts for the behavior of non-Newtonian ﬂuids by characterizing the
minimum number of functions that are needed to relate the stresses with the rate of
change of strains or strain rates. For example, the viscosity of ketchup is reduced by
shaking (or by other forms of mechanical agitation, where the relative movement of
the different layers in the material actually causes a reduction in the viscosity),
while that of water is not. Ketchup is a shear-thinning material because an increase
in relative velocity causes a reduction in the viscosity, while some other non-
Newtonian materials show the opposite behavior. That is, the viscosity increases
with relative deformation, and these materials are called shear thickening or dilat-
ant materials. Since Sir Isaac Newton drew the origins of the concept of viscosity,
the study of liquids with strain rate-dependent viscosity is also often termed as Non-
Newtonian ﬂuid mechanics (Fig. 5.23).
The viscoelastic properties of polymers are determined by the effects of many
variables, including temperature, pressure, and time. Other important variables
include chemical composition, molecular weight and weight distribution, degree of
branching and crystallinity, types of functional groups, component concentration,
dilution with solvents or plasticizers, and mixture with other materials to form
composite systems. Using molecular theory, the dependence of viscoelastic prop-
erties on these variables can be simpliﬁed by introducing additional concepts such as
free volume, monomeric friction coefﬁcient, and spacing between the entanglement
loci to provide a qualitative understanding, and in many cases, a quantitative

prediction of how to achieve the desired physical and chemical properties and
microstructure.
Viscoelastic behavior reﬂects the combination of viscous and elastic responses
of materials under mechanical stress, which are intermediate between liquids and
solids. Fundamentally, viscoelasticity can be related to the motions of the ﬂexible
polymer molecules and their entanglements and network junctions, which forms the
molecular basis of viscoelasticity. Thus, rearrangements on a local scale (kinks) are
relatively rapid, while those on a long-range scale (convolutions) are very slow. In
addition, a new assortment of conﬁgurations is obtained under stress. The response
to the local aspects of the new distribution is rapid, while the response to the long-
range aspects is slow. Thus, the range of time scales covering the response of such a
system to externally applied stress is wide and continuous. By measuring the vis-
coelastic properties of polymers, information can be obtained about the nature and
the rates of change of the conﬁgurational rearrangements and the nature of the
(macro) molecular interactions over a range of time scales (Fig. 5.24).
Examples may be given to illustrate the potential applications of these principles
to practical problems in the processing and use of rubbers, plastics, and ﬁbers.
Polymers are the basic materials of rubber and plastic industries and are of vital
importance to textile, petroleum, automobile, paper, and pharmaceutical industries.
Their viscoelastic properties determine the mechanical performance of the ﬁnal
products of these industries and the success of processing methods at intermediate
stages of production.
In viscoelastic materials such as most polymers and plastics, the presence of
liquid-like behavior depends on the properties of the applied load and hence, varies
with the rate of applied load, i.e., how quickly a force is applied. The silicone toy
“Silly Putty” behaves quite differently depending on the rate of application of a
force. On pulling slowly, silicone exhibits continuous ﬂow similar to that evidenced
in a highly viscous liquid. Alternatively, when hit hard and directly, the material
shatters like a silicate glass.

In addition, conventional rubber undergoes glass transition (often called rubber-
glass transition). The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster was caused by rubber O-
rings that were being used well below their glass transition temperature on an
unusually cold Florida morning. The O-rings could not ﬂex adequately to form
proper seals between the sections of two solid-fuel rocket boosters.
5.3.6 Tensile Behavior
Tensile strength is the maximum stress that a material can withstand while being
stretched or pulled before necking, which is when the cross section of the specimen
begins to signiﬁcantly contract. Tensile strength is the opposite of compressive
strength and the values can be quite different (Fig. 5.25).
Tensile strengths are rarely used in the design of ductile members; however, the
tensile strength is important for brittle materials. The values exhibited by common
materials such as alloys, composite materials, ceramics, plastics, and wood are
tabulated.
Tensile strength is deﬁned as tress, which is measured as force per unit area. For
some non-homogeneous materials (or for assembled components), the tensile
strength can be reported just as a force or as a force per unit width. In the SI system,
the unit of tensile strength is Pascal (Pa) [or a multiple thereof, often megapascals
(MPa)] or equivalently, Newton per square meter (N/m2). The customary unit is
pound-force per square inch (lbf/in.2 or psi) or kilo-pounds per square inch (ksi, or
sometimes kpsi), which is equal to 1,000 psi. Kilo-pounds per square inch is
commonly used for convenience when measuring tensile strengths.
Fu et al. [52] investigated the tensile properties of polypropylene composites
reinforced with short-glass ﬁbers and short-carbon ﬁbers (i.e., SGF/PP and SCF/PP,
respectively). The stress–strain curves of the SGF/PP composites and SCF/PP
composites are shown in Fig. 5.26. It can be seen that the SGF/PP composites and
SCF/PP composites exhibit brittle fracture and show linear deformation at lower
stresses and nonlinear deformation at higher stresses. The strains at failure shown
by SCF/PP composites are lower than those shown by SGF/PP composites

5.3.7 Shear Strength
Shear strength is the strength of a material or component against the type of yield or
structural failure where the material or component fails in shear. A shear load is a
force that tends to produce a sliding failure on a material along a plane parallel to
the direction of the force.
5.3.7.1 Interlaminar Shear Strength
The interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) is the interfacial shear stress or shear
strength of the matrix materials and is measured with the three-point bend test
(ASTM D2344), which is ideal for outline testing. Figure 5.27 shows a schematic of
the test and shows how shear, tensile, and compressive forces are involved [53].
Park et al. [54] investigated the effect of anodization of carbon ﬁbers on the
interfacial mechanical properties of epoxy matrix composites. Figure 5.28 shows
the ILSS of the carbon ﬁber-reinforced composites. A good relationship can be
observed between the characteristics of the anodized carbon ﬁber surfaces and the
resulting ﬁber matrix adhesions on the mechanical interfacial properties of the
composite under the employed experimental conditions. The ILSS values increase
with enhanced wettability of the ﬁbers for adhesion at interfaces caused by the
anodization, which can be attributed to the increase of the polarity of the ﬁber
surfaces.

5.3.7.2 Interfacial Shear Strength
The interfacial shear strength (IFSS) is a reliable quantitative index of the adhesion
between the ﬁber and matrix. Despite the wide application of transverse com-
pression, double cantilever beam (DCB), and other ﬂexural tests to measure the
ILSS of the composites, single-ﬁlament composite (SFC), and microbond pull-out
tests are more effective because these techniques directly measure the IFSS values
of the ﬁbers and the matrix (Fig. 5.29). Until now, most studies, which use the
microbond pull-out technique, are devoted to carbon ﬁber/epoxy composites.

IFSS can be calculated according to the following equation, which is based on the
assumption of a constant IFSS between the ﬁber and its surrounding matrix [55]:
IFSS ¼
Fd
pdfLe
ð5:4Þ
¼ rdFd
4Le
ð5:5Þ
Here, Fd is the maximum ﬁber axial force recorded at the onset of microdroplet
debonding, df is the ﬁber diameter, Le is the embedded ﬁber length, and πdfLe is the
embedment area, and σd is the tensile stress at debonding.
Li et al. [55] investigated the effective IFSS of CNT-coated carbon ﬁbers in an
epoxy matrix. The IFSS of the carbon ﬁber/epoxy composites with and without
deposited CNTs was tested by the single ﬁber composite fragmentation test (SFFT),
and the measured data are provided in Fig. 5.30. As shown in Fig. 5.30, the deposition
of the COOH–CNTs leads to a signiﬁcant increase of the IFSS (approximately 43 %)
for the T700SC composite. Moreover, the IFSS of the T300B composite increases by
approximately 12 and 11 % after the deposition of COOH–CNTs and OH–CNTs,
respectively. However, the T700SC composite shows a decrease in the IFSS by 17 %
after the deposition of OH–CNTs. It was also studied the strength and interfacial shear
strength of carbon ﬁbers/poly-(phenylene sulﬁde) (PPS) composites with plasma
surface treatments, such as oxygen, argon, and styrene plasma, by Yuan et al. [56].
5.3.8 Flexural Behavior
The ﬂexure test method measures the behavior of materials subjected to simple
beam loading. It is also called the transverse beam test with some materials. The
maximum ﬁber stress and maximum strain are calculated for increments of load and

deposited CNTs on IFSS of
single ﬁber composites. Error

deviation [55]

Testing of Carbon Fibers and Their Composites

the results are plotted in a stress–strain diagram. Flexural strength is deﬁned as the
maximum stress in the outermost ﬁber. This is calculated at the surface of
the specimen on the convex or tension side. Flexural modulus is calculated from the
slope of the stress versus deﬂection curve. If the curve has no linear region, a secant
line is ﬁtted to the curve to determine the slope. There are three relevant standards,
i.e., ASTM D790M, BSI 2782 Method 1005, and CRAG, and all of them cover a
four-point procedure.
A ﬂexure test produces tensile stress in the convex side of the specimen and
compression stress in the concave side. This creates an area of shear stress along the
midline. To ensure that the primary failure originates from the tensile or com-
pression stress, the shear stress must be minimized. This is ensured by controlling
the span to depth ratio (S/d), which is the length of the outer span divided by the
height (depth) of the specimen. For most materials, an S/d of 16 is acceptable. Some
materials require an S/d of 32–64 to keep the shear stress sufﬁciently low.
Flexure testing is often done on relatively ﬂexible materials such as polymers,
wood, and composites. There are two test types: three-point ﬂex (Fig. 5.31) and
four-point ﬂex (Fig. 5.32). In a three-point test, the area of uniform stress is quite
small and concentrated under the center loading point. In a four-point test, the area
of uniform stress exists between the inner span loading points (typically half the
outer span length).

Mannocci et al. [57] investigated the structure of the posts by confocal
microscopy, and to evaluate the ﬂexural strength of ﬁber posts stored under different
conditions, a three-point bending test was used simultaneously to observe the
failure mode of the posts by confocal microscopy (Fig. 5.33).
5.3.9 Uniaxial Compressive Behavior
Compressive strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand axially
directed pushing forces. It provides data (or a plot) of force versus deformation for
the conditions used in a test. When the limit of compressive strength is reached,
brittle materials are crushed.
Kumar et al. [58] investigated that the uniaxial compression behavior of adhe-
sively bonded composite scarf-joints. Figure 5.34 shows the typical geometry of our
compression test specimens. These were 12.5 mm wide and had a gauge length of
10 mm in order to ensure that there was a compromise between the need to
overcome Euler macrobuckling and end-tab effects. If the gauge length was too
short, the end-tabs would become too close to each other and will not allow uniform
distribution of stresses in the central region.

Figure 5.35 shows the unidirectional compressive scarf-joint strength as a function
of scarf-angle, θ. As shown by Fig. 5.35, smaller (i.e., steeper) scarf-angles yielded
higher compressive joint strengths compared to those with larger scarf-angles.

The knockdown in compressive strength is most prominent for scarf-joint angles less
than about 1°. As the scarf-angle of the joint increases, the additional reduction in
compressive strength becomes more gradual.
5.3.10 Fatigue
Fatigue is determined under cyclic loading when a crack is initiated and then grows
to a critical size to result in failures occurring at stresses below the values obtained
for normal static tests. In general, any static test adopted for fatigue testing is much
more demanding. The shape of the test specimen is chosen to fail within the gage
length in a manner akin to the failure of a structural component. Fatigue tests can be
undertaken in the tensile, ﬂexural, compression, and shear modes and are generally
carried out in a servo-hydraulic test machine. Optical microscopy, ultrasonics,
X-ray, and infrared thermography are used for detecting the onset and study of
fatigue failure [53].
Khan et al. [59] investigated the fatigue damage behaviors of carbon ﬁber-
reinforced epoxy composites containing nanoclay. Figure 5.36 shows the damage
index, D, plotted as a function of the fatigue cycles for hybrid composites con-
taining different clay contents. It can be seen that at the early stage of fatigue (say
0–12,500 cycles), the hybrid composites in general exhibited marginally more
damage than the neat composites. After the initial damage period, the hybrid
composite specimens sustained a relatively longer stable period with low damage
indices for the rest of their fatigue life. The ﬁnal failure took place much earlier in
the neat composite than in the clay-CFRP hybrid composites. Further, the higher the
clay content, the longer was the fatigue life, with the exception of hybrid com-
posites containing 5 wt% clay. The diminishing improvement in fatigue life in the
case of composites with clay contents higher than 3 wt% is attributed to the higher
possibility of the formation of unwanted agglomerates of a relatively large size.

5.3.11 Creep
The application of a force to a material over a sustained period of time induces
creep and if this force eventually leads to cracking, fracture, or rupture, the process
is termed as stress cracking, static fatigue, or creep rupture. Further, if the envi-
ronment speeds up the process, the rupture is termed as environmental stress
cracking. The creep of a composite material will depend on the reinforcement and
the matrix. Carbon ﬁbers are not signiﬁcantly affected by creep, although some loss
of strength can be expected to occur under sustained loading. However, the matrix
will exhibit creep, and a thermoplastic will exhibit creep to a higher extent than a
thermosetting resin. However, if the ﬁber is well aligned in a unidirectional com-
posite, it will have good resistance to creep along the ﬁber axis, although it would
display creep during torsion and ﬂexure. Plastics do tend to recover when the stress
is removed, as long as no damage has occurred [53].
5.3.12 Impact Behavior
The Izod impact test is shown schematically in Fig. 5.37. The test setup and
procedure are similar to those outlined above. In the Izod test, the specimen is
clamped in the vertical plane as a cantilever beam and impacted by a swinging
pendulum at the unsupported end. The test suffers similar problems to those
reported above and again is best suited as a tool for ranking the impact resistance of
composite materials.
The Charpy impact test is a standardized high strain-rate test, which determines
the amount of energy absorbed by a material during fracture (Fig. 5.38). The
specimen is supported in a horizontal plane and impacted by a swinging pendulum
directly opposite the notch. The energy dissipated during impact is usually recorded
by a dial on the test apparatus. Further information can be obtained by instru-
menting the impactor with a strain gauge, thereby enabling the determination of the
Fig. 5.37 Izod impact test
5.3

169

variation of the impact force with time. The energy absorbed during impact can also
be determined by integrating the force/time signal.
Therefore, the low-velocity impact test is performed with a drop-weight impact
tester instead of Izod and Charpy tests [60]. Park et al. [61] investigated the impact
strength of C/C composites as a function of the MoSi2 content in the prepreg resin
using a drop weighting impact tester. The impact properties of C/C composites are
improved on increasing the MoSi2 content, which coincides with the results
obtained for fracture toughness. Hence, the C/C composites with MoSi2 affect the
impact damage conditions in comparison with composites without MoSi2. During
impact damage in C/C composites with low-velocity impact (1.8 m/s), the damage
zone acts as a soft region within a stiff laminate and magniﬁes the stress locally
because of matrix cracking, ﬁber debonding delamination, and ﬁber fracture
(Fig. 5.39).

5.3.13 Fracture Toughness
The fundamental fracture events occurring in the fragmentation test are illustrated in
Fig. 5.40. In the initial state (0), there is no damage, and the specimen compliance is
C0. The energy released by the ﬁrst ﬁber fracture, G, is determined from the
difference in the specimen compliance after (1) and before the ﬁrst ﬁber fracture
(i.e., C1–C0). The second fracture state (2) considers the debonding, which follows
the ﬁrst ﬁber fracture. An expression for G for debonding, which occurs subsequent
to a ﬁber break can be derived in terms of the compliance difference between C2
and C1. Finally, in the third state (3), the specimen is supposed to be unloaded and
then loaded again until the existing debonding begins to grow. The energy release
rate, Gd, corresponding to growth of the debonding after unloading and reloading
the specimen is determined from the compliance change (i.e., C3–C2). One
important condition for this analysis is that the debonding grows before further ﬁber
breakage occurs in the single ﬁber fragmentation test specimen [62].
The expression for the calculation of mode-II critical strain energy release rate,
GIIC, was derived from the Irwin and Kies expression for fracture energy [63, 64] as
follows:
GC ¼ P2
2W  dC
da
ð5:9Þ
In the above equation, P is the load, C is the compliance (displacement/load = δ/P),
and a is the crack length. In this study, GIIC was calculated using the direct beam
theory method [63, 64], which used the end notched ﬂexure (ENF) compliance
expression given by [63, 65] the following equation:
C ¼ 2L3 þ 3a2
8Ef Wh3
ð5:10Þ
In the above equation, L is the half-span length, a is the crack length, Ef is the
ﬂexural modulus, and h is the half the specimen thickness. From (5.9) and (5.10),
with a as the sole variable for C, the following equation can be obtained:

The maximum load was used as the critical load PC to determine the critical
energy release rate and fracture toughness.
Figure 5.41 shows the typical relationship between the load and displacement at
the central loading point of the ENF specimens. Elastic behavior is observed in the
ENF specimens. Therefore, the maximum load is used as the critical load to
determine the critical energy release rate and fracture toughness.

can be expressed by the sum of the London dispersive ðrSLÞ and speciﬁc (or polar,

The superscripts L and SP are the components of the surface free energy
resulting from intermolecular interactions of the London force of van der Waals
attraction and the speciﬁc force (Debye, Keesom, hydrogen bonding, and other
small polar effects), respectively. When the surface free energy of a solid can be
determined on the basis of the contact angle measurements using the geometric
mean, the work of adhesion, WA, according to the Fowkes’ proposition [89] based
on the solid (S)–liquid (L) droplet–air system, can be described by the following

h is the contact angle of a liquid droplet in the solid state. For use on a large variety
of polar solids, at least two nonidentical liquids with polar surface energies, such as
water, diiodomethane, ethylene glycol, and glycerol, are needed if the values of rL
L
and rLSP are known.
Park et al. [61] investigated the effects of the MoSi content on the work of
adhesion of the C/C composites. In Fig. 5.42, the MoSi ﬁller increases the work of
adhesion, which is strictly inﬂuenced by the London dispersive component, WAL:
In each case, it can also be seen that WAL is more predominant than the speciﬁc
component ðWASPÞ with respect to the work of adhesion of the composites. This is
due to the carbonaceous nature of the composites caused by the decrease of oxygen
functional groups, since carbonization leads to a very low content of oxygen.

5.4.2 Surface Free Energy Analysis Using Linear Fit Method
The wettability of carbon ﬁbers was determined by measuring the wicking rates
either by the mass pickup technique or by the surface velocity method. The contact
angle used in this investigation was then calculated using Washburn’s equation
[67, 68], which deﬁnes the ﬂow of a liquid through a capillary as follows:
m
t ¼ c  q2  cL  cos h

ð5:16Þ
In (5.16), m is the weight of the penetrating liquid, t is the ﬂow time, c is the
packing factor, γL is the surface tension of liquid, and η and ρ2 are the liquid density
and viscosity, respectively. The London dispersive and speciﬁc components of
surface free energy of carbon ﬁbers are determined by measuring the contact angles
of a variety of testing liquids with known London dispersive and speciﬁc com-
ponents and by analyzing the results in accordance with the method proposed by
Owens and Wendt [69] and Kaelble [70], using the geometric mean.

Park et al. [71] investigated the surface free energies and their oxyﬂuorinated
carbon ﬁber components are listed in Table 5.6. A decrease in the surface free
energies is observed. The higher the ﬂuorine content on the carbon ﬁber surfaces,
the weaker the surface free energies. In other words, seemingly the polar compo-
nent of the surface free energy increases at higher degrees of ﬂuorination, and then
decreases slightly again for lower degrees of ﬂuorination and with increasing
ﬂuorination temperatures. All of the experimental results listed in Table 5.6 are
those usually observed for ﬂuorinated carbon materials, considering that C–F
bonding varies from chemical to physical bonding with increasing ﬂuorination
temperatures (for CFx prepared at 100 °C or higher).

5.4.3 Weibull Distribution
Both the tensile and pull-out strength of carbon ﬁbers are usually assessed by single
ﬁlament tensile tests [72]. The experimental data generated by these tests have high
scatter, mainly because of the presence of ﬂaws along the ﬁbers. Thus, the inter-
pretation of the data must be done statistically. Several statistical distributions have
been used to describe the tensile data, the most ﬂexible so far being the Weibull
distribution [73, 74].

ð5:18Þ
In (5.18), σ is the load factor, σ0 is the Weibull scale, and m represents the shape
parameters. The ﬂaw-induced nature of ﬁber failure leads to a length dependence of
its tensile strength, i.e., the longer the ﬁber length, the larger the number of ﬂaws
that are present and the higher is the probability of occurrence of a severe ﬂaw. The
Weibull distribution has to be adapted to account for this dependence.
This also assumes that the strength distribution of each independent link is
described by a simple Weibull distribution characterized by identical parameters.
This leads to ﬁber survival probabilities equal to the product of the survival
probabilities of each link. On the basis of these considerations, the Weibull
cumulative distribution function F (σ; σ0, m) and the corresponding mean Weibull
strength (r), adapted to account for the gauge length dependence of the ﬁbers (L),
may be described by the following equations:

In the above equation, Γ is the gamma function.
The parameter estimate for the two-parameter Weibull distribution is made for
the strength data obtained at all gauge lengths simultaneously. In this work, the
maximum likelihood theory is used to determine the Weibull parameters. The
method used is described in Stoner’s thesis [75] and in the calculation programs
explained in the thesis. In this way, for each type of ﬁber, a single set of parameters
is obtained that ﬁts all the gauge lengths tested [76]. The estimate of the tensile
strength at any gauge length needed for the interfacial shear strength calculations is
performed simply by substituting the calculated parameters into (5.20), for the
speciﬁed ﬁber length.
Also, the load factor (σ) and L taken as part of the σ0 parameter are redeﬁned
with the unit of stress (MPa) such that the Weibull distribution function can be
expressed as follows:

By taking logarithm of the survival probability (1 −P) twice, we also obtained
the following equation:

ð5:22Þ
The parameters m and σ0 deﬁning the Weibull distribution are usually deter-
mined either graphically or numerically by the least-squares method. Therefore, we
can assign a failure probability Pi to each value of σi after ranking all the measured
values in ascending order (i taking values from 1 to n, which corresponds to the
number of measurements of the sample tested), according to one of the principal
probabilities used.
P ¼ i=ðn þ 1Þ
ð5:23Þ
After the tensile and pull-out tests on the carbon ﬁbers, Park et al. [77] ordered the
fracture strength values for each sample and assigned a probability Pi to each value σi
using (5.22). The different cumulative probability distributions are shown in
Fig. 5.43. For an initial failure probability at 6 %, the fracture strength is increased
from 5.6 MPa for the as-received state to 10.9 MPa after a 1.0 keV Ar+ ion treatment.
The distributions for entire Ar+ ion-irradiated carbon ﬁbers are comparably closer to
each other, with the exception of a few high extreme values. Also, the Weibull
parameter m and the scale parameter σ0 of all the ion-irradiated carbon ﬁbers after
pull-out tests exhibit similar behavior, compared with as-received carbon ﬁbers, as

listed in Table 5.7. This means that the interfacial shear strength (τ) or failure
strength of Ar+ ion-irradiated single-ﬁlament carbon ﬁber is dependent on the failure
mechanism of carbon ﬁbers in an epoxy matrix system.

Manufacture of Carbon Fiber Composites
Soo-Jin Park and Min-Kang Seo
Abstract Currently, the use of carbon ﬁbers and their composites in space and
aerospace applications continues to grow. However, the vast majority of composite
molding is used in automotive, marine, industrial, and recreational applications. In
this chapter, a brief explanation of various processing methods will be provided and
the manufacturing processes typically used to make products found in various
applications will be covered. Further, it is classiﬁed into two types—open molding
and closed molding process—which will be described.
6.1 Selection of Manufacturing Process for Carbon Fiber
Composites
In many cases, composite processing uses the same technique as matrix processing,
which includes injection molding, compression molding, and extrusion. There are
other techniques unique only to composite processing. These include ﬁlament
winding, pultrusion, and hand layup. Although some techniques are used com-
monly in polymer processing, the operational conditions can be very different; thus,
it is important not to directly transfer knowledge without careful consideration
[1, 2]. In this section, a brief explanation of various processing methods will be
provided and the manufacturing processes typically used to make products found in
construction/civil infrastructure market will be covered.
The creation of a product from many different manufacturing processes is unique
to the composites industry. There are a wide variety of processes available to the
composites manufacturer to produce cost-efﬁcient products. Each of the fabrication

processes consists of characteristics that deﬁne the type of products to be produced.
This is advantageous because these characteristics allow the manufacturer to pro-
vide the best solution for the customer. In order to select the most efﬁcient man-
ufacturing process, the manufacturing team considers several factors such as user
needs, performance requirements, size of the product, surface complexity,
appearance, production rate, total production volume, economic targets/limitations,
labor, materials, tooling/assembly, and equipment.
The identiﬁcation of the process route is essential during the early stages of
design because the process selection, material selection, and design features are
intimately linked and for practical purposes are inseparable.
The beneﬁts of identifying the process route include the following:
• Maximized process efﬁciency and quality
• Total process development and solutions achieve concept to prototype to
product transition
• Ensuring that process robustness is factored into new product developments
• Requirement of shorter durations to market new developments
• Absence of exposure to the risk associated with the capital investment of
equipment
• Informed, impartial advice and support as and when required
The development of a robust process technology is fundamental to the success of
any new composite product venture. Drawing on a wealth of experience, covering
virtually every sector of the polymer industry, it is possible to receive guidance on
all aspects of the process from tool design and scale-up through to a complete line
layout.
There is a variety of processing routes for obtaining composites. Selecting the
right process for the product is paramount to achieve success. It is vital that
throughout the design process, there is a fundamental understanding of the range of
processes available along with their advantages, disadvantages, and limitations. For
instance, a poor design may exclude a more cost-effective production route. Key
factors inﬂuencing the process selection are as follows:
• Number of parts required
• Matrix type
• Reinforcement type
• Shape and complexity of the product
• Size of the product
• Cost per unit part
• Dimensional accuracy and tolerances
• Appearance/ﬁnishing of the product
• Strength and stiffness
• Postprocessing/assembly techniques

6.2 Type of Reinforcement
Regardless of the materials, reinforcements are available in forms to serve a wide
range of processes and end product requirements. Materials supplied as rein-
forcements include roving, milled ﬁber, chopped strands, and continuous, chopped,
or thermoformable mats. Reinforcement materials can be designed with unique
ﬁber architectures and can be preformed (shaped) depending on the product
requirements and manufacturing process.
6.2.1 Multiend and Single-End Rovings
Rovings are used primarily in thermoset compounds, but can be used in thermo-
plastics. Multiend rovings consist of many individual strands or bundles of ﬁla-
ments, which are then chopped and randomly deposited into the matrix resin.
Processes such as sheet molding compound (SMC), preform, and spray-up use
multiend roving. Multiend rovings can also be used in some ﬁlament winding and
pultrusion applications. The single-end roving consists of many individual ﬁlaments
wound into a single strand. The product is generally used in processes that use a
unidirectional reinforcement, such as ﬁlament winding and pultrusion.
6.2.2 Mats
Reinforcing mats are usually described by weight per unit area. For instance, a 2-
ounce chopped strand mat will weigh 2 ounce per square yard. The type and amount
of binder used to hold the mat together dictate the differences between mat products.
In some processes such as hand layup, it is necessary for the binder to dissolve. In
other processes, particularly in compression molding, the binder is required to
withstand the hydraulic forces and the dissolving action of the matrix resin during
molding. Therefore, two categories of mats, i.e., soluble and insoluble, are produced.
6.2.3 Woven, Stitched, and Braided Fabrics
Many types of fabrics can be used to reinforce resins in a composite. Multidirec-
tional reinforcements are produced by weaving, knitting, stitching, or braiding
continuous ﬁbers into a fabric from twisted and plied yarns. Fabrics refer to all ﬂat-
sheet, roll goods, irrespective of whether they are strictly fabrics. Fabrics can be
manufactured by using almost any reinforcing ﬁber. The most common fabrics are
constructed with ﬁberglass, carbon, or aramid. Fabrics are available in several
6.2
Type of Reinforcement
181

weave constructions and thicknesses (from 0.0010 to 0.40″). Fabrics offer oriented
strengths and high-reinforcement loadings often found in high-performance appli-
cations (Fig. 6.1).
Fabrics are typically supplied on rolls of 25–300 yards in length and 1–120″ in
width. The fabric must be inherently stable enough to be handled, cut, and trans-
ported to the mold, but pliable enough to conform to the mold shape and contours.
When properly designed, the fabric will allow for quick wet-out and wet-through of
the resin and will stay in place once the resin is applied. Fabrics such as rovings and
chopped strands come with speciﬁc sizings or binder systems, which promote
adhesion to the resin system.
Fabrics allow for the precise placement of the reinforcement. This cannot be
done with milled ﬁbers or chopped strands and is only possible with continuous
strands using relatively expensive ﬁber placement equipment. Because of the
continuous nature of the ﬁbers in most fabrics, the strength-to-weight ratio is much
higher than that encountered in the case of cut or chopped ﬁber versions. Stitched
fabrics allow for customized ﬁber orientations within the fabric structure. This can
be of great advantage when designing for shear or torsional stability.
Woven fabrics are fabricated on looms in a variety of weights, weaves, and
widths. In a plain weave, each ﬁll yarn or roving is alternately crossed over and
under each warp ﬁber, allowing the fabric to be more drapeable and to conform to
curve surfaces. Woven fabrics are manufactured, wherein half of the strands of ﬁber
are laid at right angles to the other half (0°–90°) (Fig. 6.2). Woven fabrics are
commonly used in boat manufacturing.
Stitched fabrics, also known as nonwoven, noncrimped, stitched, or knitted
fabrics, have optimized strength properties because of the ﬁber architecture. In the
woven fabric, two sets of interlaced continuous ﬁbers are oriented in a 0° and 90°
pattern, where the ﬁbers are crimped and are not straight. Stitched fabrics are
produced by assembling successive layers of aligned ﬁbers. Typically, the available
ﬁber orientations include the 0° direction (warp), 90° direction (weft or ﬁll),
and ±45° direction (bias). The assembly of each layer is then sewn together. This
type of construction allows for load sharing between the ﬁbers so that a higher
modulus, both tensile and ﬂexural, is typically observed. The ﬁber architecture

construction allows for optimum resin ﬂow when composites are manufactured.
These fabrics have been traditionally used in boat hulls for 50 years. Other appli-
cations include light poles, wind turbine blades, trucks, busses, and underground
tanks. These fabrics are currently used in bridge decks and column repair systems.
Multiple orientations provide a quasi-isotropic reinforcement.
Braided fabrics are engineered with a system of two or more yarns intertwined in
such a way that all of the yarns are interlocked for optimum load distribution.
Biaxial braids provide reinforcement in the bias direction only with ﬁber angles
ranging from ±15° to ±95° (Fig. 6.3). Triaxial braids provide reinforcement in the
bias direction with ﬁber angles ranging from ±10° to ±80° and axial (0°) direction.
6.2.4 Unidirectional
Unidirectional reinforcements include tapes, tows, unidirectional tow sheets, and
rovings (which are collections of ﬁbers or strands). Fibers in this form are all
aligned parallel in one direction and uncrimped providing the highest mechanical
properties (Fig. 6.4). Composites using unidirectional tapes or sheets have high
strength in the direction of the ﬁber. Unidirectional sheets are thin, and multiple
layers are required for most structural applications.

In some composite designs, it may be necessary to provide a corrosion or
weather barrier to the surface of the product. A surface veil is a fabric made from
nylon or polyester that acts as a very thin sponge, which is capable of absorbing
resin to 90 % of its volume. This helps to provide an extra layer of protective resin
on the surface of the product. Surface veils are used to improve the surface
appearance and ensure the presence of a corrosion resistance barrier for typical
composite products such as pipes, tanks, and other chemical process equipment.
Other beneﬁts include increased resistance to abrasion, ultraviolet (UV), and other
weathering forces. Veils may be used in conjunction with gel coats to provide
reinforcement to the resin.
6.2.5 Sandwich Construction
A typical sandwich construction consists of two strong and relatively thin outer
sheets or faces separated by but adhered to a layer of a less dense and low-cost core
material, which has lower strength and lower stiffness (see Fig. 6.5). The faces bear
most of the in-plane loading and transverse bending stresses. The core separates the
faces and resists deformation perpendicular to the face, while providing a certain
degree of shear rigidity along planes perpendicular to the faces. The face materials
could be metals (e.g., titanium, steel, and aluminum alloys), plywood, or a ﬁber-
reinforced composite. The core could be made of materials such as foamed plastics,
synthetic rubbers, balsa wood, honeycomb, and truss. The sandwich architecture
provides exceptional ﬂexural stiffness compared to monocoque structures, while
reducing weight and cost.

6.2.6 Prepregs
Prepregs are a ready-made material made of a reinforcement form and polymer
matrix. Passing reinforcing ﬁbers or fabrics through a resin bath is used to make a
prepreg. The resin is saturated (impregnated) into the ﬁber and then heated to
advance the curing reaction to different curing stages. Thermoset or thermoplastic
prepregs are available and can be either stored in a refrigerator or at room tem-
perature depending on the constituent materials. Prepregs can be manually or
mechanically applied at various directions based on the design requirements.
6.3 Type of Matrix
6.3.1 Polymer Matrix Selection
The matrix of composites works as a binder transferring the loads through the ﬁber
network. It maintains the ﬁber orientation and protects the ﬁbers from environ-
mental effects, redistributing the load to the surrounding ﬁbers when an individual
ﬁber breaks. Important criteria to be considered when selecting a resin candidate are
the stiffness (elastic modulus), the yield and ultimate strengths, and toughness
properties. Other factors such as thermal properties, processability, cost, avail-
ability, and health concerns are also of great importance [3].
The resin must be compatible with the processing method. Resin transfer
molding (RTM) is the main process required during polymer matrix selection. This
process involves a two-part mold in which a ﬁber preform is placed and the mold is
closed. The resin is then pumped under low pressure through injection ports into the
mold, ﬁlling the mold, and completely wetting out the reinforcement. Both the mold
and resin can be heated depending on the type of resin. Currently, the aerospace

industry is a major user of RTM components, and the automotive industry has made
limited use of RTM for decades [4].
RTM is also gaining popularity in infrastructure, sports, and military industries.
The advantages of RTM relative to hand layup are improved quality, higher pro-
duction rates, reduced labor, and lower volatiles emissions, while the main disad-
vantages are higher equipment costs and the need for low-viscosity resins.
The application of composite materials to primary structure to reduce structural
weight is forcing structural designers and materials engineers to look for new and
tough resin systems. Thermosets, elastomers, and thermoplastics are the three main
categories of polymers. Thermoset polymers dominate as matrices in structural
composite applications because of their good mechanical and thermal properties,
good bonding to reinforcement, low cost, low viscosity, and ease of processing.
Interest in thermoplastics is increasing because of their advantages such as
toughness, potential processing advantages, recyclability, and low-volatile emis-
sions, while their high viscosity and poor bonding to reinforcement are disadvan-
tageous [5]. Tough resins are generally formulated by adding elastomeric or
thermoplastic compounds to the more brittle thermoset resin base. Elastomers
generally have too low of an elastic modulus to serve as a matrix for rigid structural
composites.
The selection of a resin involves several factors. Chemical characteristics such as
resin viscosity, glass transition temperature (Tg), gel time, cure cycle, injection
pressure, thermal stability, shelf life, environmental resistance, and volatile emis-
sions during processing are some of the parameters that need to be considered to
determine operating and processing conditions for a speciﬁc resin. Mechanical
properties such as strength and elastic modulus in certain directions, interlaminar
fracture toughness, and environmental resistance are major composite properties to
which the matrix must contribute [5, 6].
The most common thermoset resins used as composite matrices are unsaturated
polyesters, epoxies, and vinyl esters. These resins offer good processability for
liquid processing techniques such as RTM. The nature of the RTM process and the
requirements of the wind turbine blade applications demand that the resin system
should meet the target requirements. Of these, the resin modulus is important in
maintaining composite compressive strength, particularly under hot and wet
conditions.
Preferred resin characteristics include the following:
• Low cost
• Resin elastic modulus of 2.75 GPa or higher
• Resin viscosity ranging from 100 to 500 cps
• Tg of 70 °C or higher
• Low moisture absorption
• Gel time of at least 20 min
• Preferably curable at room temperature
• High toughness
186

Manufacture of Carbon Fiber Composites

Currently, unsaturated polyester resins are the most common systems used in
composites by the wind turbine industry for the manufacture of blades. They are the
most affordable, are easily processed, and possess adequate mechanical properties.
However, most polyesters are brittle resins and have low-temperature resistance and
signiﬁcant moisture sensitivity. Vinyl esters are a chemical mixture of unsaturated
polyesters and epoxy resins. The result is a resin with mechanical, thermal, and
chemical properties similar to epoxies, with the ease of processing and high rate of
cross-linking of unsaturated polyesters [5]. Vinyl ester resins are also stiff and
brittle, but are tougher than polyesters because of the presence of the epoxy
backbone [5]. Epoxy resins are widely used for high-performance composites,
especially in aerospace, military, and sports industries [5, 7–11]. Epoxy resins
generally offer an increase in mechanical properties compared to polyesters and
vinyl esters, but at a higher cost [3]. Another disadvantage of epoxies is their
relatively high water absorption rate in comparison with vinyl esters [5]. The nature
of curing for thermosets is explained in the following section. Details of each major
thermoset resin material are described later.
6.3.2 Overview of Polymers
A polymer is a long molecule containing atoms held together primarily by covalent
bonds along the molecule, while secondary bonds act between molecules [12]. The
secondary bonds are an order of magnitude weaker than the covalent bonds. In
general, thermoplastic polymers consist of separate molecules held together by
secondary bonds. Thermoset polymers, when cured, form a three-dimensional
network of covalent bonded segments, with secondary bonds forming between
adjacent segments of the cross-links [13–19].
Thermoplastics can be separated into two subgroups: semicrystalline and non-
crystalline (amorphous). Thermoplastics are linear or branched polymers, which
melt upon heating when the thermal energy is adequate to overcome the secondary
bonds. When melted, thermoplastics have a relatively high viscosity, which restricts
available processing methods. Thermosets are cross-linked network polymers,
which are amorphous and cannot be melted once the network is formed during
curing. Thermosets have a relatively low viscosity prior to curing, which allows for
convenient processing with adhesives and composites. They are also very reactive
prior to curing, which allows for good bonding to the reinforcement [20]. Curing
occurs after the product is in its ﬁnal form.
In amorphous polymers, molecules can slip relative to each other without
breaking covalent bonds. Chain slippage provides high strain to failure and
toughness and damage tolerance. Semicrystalline polymers possess an increased
strength and temperature and environmental resistance compared to amorphous
thermoplastics. In thermosets, cross-linking is the process by which covalent bonds
are formed between molecules through a chemical reaction creating a giant three-
dimensional network. The polymer chains between the cross-links are now not as
6.3
Type of Matrix
187

free to slip relative to each other, and thermosets have improved elastic modulus,
creep resistance, and thermal/environmental resistance relative to thermoplastics,
but at the expense of relatively brittle behavior [21].
When cross-links are formed in thermosets, the liquid polymer starts losing its
ability to ﬂow because the molecules can no longer slip past one another. Curing is
the process of extending the polymer chain length and cross-linking chains together
into a network. The molecular weight increases with the growth of the chain, and
then, chains are linked together into a network of nearly inﬁnite molecular weight.
Curing is evident when there is a sudden change of the resin from a liquid to
viscoelastic mass called a gel [22]. From the processing point of view, gelation is a
critical factor because the polymer does not ﬂow and is no longer processable
beyond this point. The mechanism of curing differs for each polymer group, as will
be discussed later.
The reason for coating the ﬁbers is to improve the ﬁber/matrix interfacial
strength and moisture resistance through both physical and chemical bonds and to
protect the ﬁber surface from abrasion during handling conditions. Curing param-
eters and chemical agents for cross-linking a resin are different for each speciﬁc
type of resin. A system requiring only a catalyst to begin the curing process is said
to be promoted. A system requiring chemical compounds for the catalyst to initiate
the cross-linking reaction of a resin is termed as an unpromoted system.
Epoxy resins are usually obtained in a two- or three-part system, which reacts
when mixed together at the proper temperature. The reason suppliers often provide
unpromoted resins to users is because the amount of promoter added to a resin will
directly affect the processing time and shelf life.
6.3.3 Properties of Polymers
6.3.3.1 Thermal Properties
Properties at elevated temperatures and the maximum use temperature are major
concerns in the application of composite materials. These properties are dictated by
the polymer matrix. Tg is deﬁned as the temperature at which mobility between the
molecules and segments in the amorphous regions becomes possible.
Above this temperature, the polymer is rubbery; below this temperature, the
polymer is rigid. A partially crystalline polymer retains some rigidity up to the
melting temperature, Tm, which is higher than Tg, even though the amorphous part
of the material is soft and rubbery. Tg is the point at which there is adequate thermal
energy to overcome secondary bonds; thus, segments of chains are then free to
move, while being restrained at points of cross-linking (thermosets), chain entan-
glement (amorphous thermoplastics), or crystallites (semicrystalline thermoplas-
tics). The polymer softens signiﬁcantly with the temperature increasing to the
proximity of Tg. The maximum use temperature for an amorphous polymer used as
a composite matrix is usually below Tg [19].
188
6
Manufacture of Carbon Fiber Composites

The speciﬁc heat capacity of a polymer is higher when the molecules are free to
move, and hence, the value of speciﬁc heat capacity decreases with decrease in
cross-linking and increases with increase in temperature to the proximity of Tg. A
differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) can be used to measure Tg by measuring the
change in heat capacity. The DSC measures the difference in enthalpy and weight
between a sample and a reference material, both subjected to a controlled tem-
perature program [19]. Measurement of Tg of the thermosets used in this study was
difﬁcult, particularly when the samples were wet.
Another method to estimate the temperature at which a polymer softens is by the
heat deﬂection temperature (HDT) measurement [22]. This technique determines
the temperature when bending deﬂection at a constant stress increases rapidly.
Details of this technique are described later.
6.3.3.2 Tension and Compression
Tension and compression tests are used to determine the yield and ultimate
strengths and the ductility of a material. For a composite material, the stress–strain
response is a function of the matrix and ﬁber properties. For a unidirectional
composite, the slope of the stress–strain curve (Fig. 6.6) and the longitudinal elastic
modulus, E11, can be accurately predicted by the rule of mixtures [23].
E11 ¼ Vf  Ef þ Vm  Em
ð6:1Þ
where Ef is the ﬁber modulus, Em is the matrix modulus, and Vf is the ﬁber volume
fraction, Vm = (1 −Vf), if no porosity is present.
In the transverse direction perpendicular to the ﬁber axis, the modulus E22 is
approximated by the Halpin–Tsai relationship [24]:

ð
Þ, n is the
Poisson’s ratio, E12f is the shear modulus of the ﬁber, z is the curve ﬁtting factor
given as 2 for E22 [24], and h is the curve ﬁtting factor.
In polymer matrix composites, the transverse modulus is dominated by the
matrix modulus, while the longitudinal modulus is dominated by the ﬁber modulus.
The stress–strain curve for unidirectional materials is usually approximately linear
to failure. The tensile strength in the longitudinal direction occurs approximately
when the strain in the ﬁber reaches a value close to the ﬁber ultimate strain. The
transverse strength (and shear strength) is dominated by the matrix, with the mode
of failure being a crack growing parallel to the ﬁbers in the matrix and ﬁber/matrix
interface. The limiting value for the transverse tensile strength is the ultimate
strength of the matrix. For brittle resins and/or poorly bonded ﬁbers, the transverse
strength will be lower than the matrix strength [25]. The compressive strength of
unidirectional composites in the longitudinal direction is also a matrix-dominated
property for most glass ﬁber composites [25]. Failure occurs when the ﬁbers locally
buckle or kink in the matrix; the matrix provides lateral resistance against buckling.
The compressive strength can be approximated by the following equation:
s ¼ Gm=2 1 þ vf


ð6:3Þ
where Gm ¼ Em=2 1 þ v
ð
Þ; s is the predicted compressive strength; Gm is the shear
modulus of the resin; n is the Poisson’s ratio of the resin; and Em is the tensile
modulus of the resin.
This formula assumes perfect ﬁber alignment and tends to signiﬁcantly over-
estimate the compressive strength [24]. Most composites are used with layers in
various directions. The ply layup used for multidirectional laminates in this thesis
was mostly [0/+45/0]s, where s indicates symmetry about the mid-thickness; thus,
this was an eight-ply laminate. This laminate was tested at both the 0° and 90°
directions. The stress–strain curve for a multidirectional laminate is a function of
the stress–strain behavior of each ply, transformed to the overall laminate coordi-
nates. The stress–strain response is usually predicted by a laminated plate theory-
based software program [22]. A typical stress–strain curve for a multidirectional
laminate in tension would then include nonlinear responses where off-axis plies
cracked, with the ultimate strength dominated by 0° layers if any (Fig. 6.6).
In the absence of 0° ﬁbers in the direction considered, the knee strength is the
most important criterion for design. It affords the designer an estimate of how much
elastic elongation the material can tolerate prior to signiﬁcant matrix cracking. The
stress at which knee strain occurs is called the 0.2 % offset knee stress, calculated
by drawing a parallel line (that has an origin at 0.2 % strain) to the linear portion of
the stress–strain curve until it intersects the curve (Fig. 6.7) [26]. This is similar to
190

the usual method used to deﬁne the yield stress in metals and polymers. The neat
matrix yield stress was calculated in this manner in this study.
6.3.4 Polymer Chemistry
The primary functions of the resin are to transfer stress between the reinforcing
ﬁbers, act as a glue to hold the ﬁbers together, and protect the ﬁbers from the
mechanical and environmental damage. To enable the ﬁbers to carry maximum
load, the matrix must have a lower modulus against elongation than the rein-
forcement. The matrix determines the service operating temperature of the com-
posites as well as the processing parameters for part manufacturing.
Polymer matrix resins are divided into two major groups known as thermoset
and thermoplastic. Thermoset resins are usually liquids or low-melting solids in
their initial form. When used to produce ﬁnished goods, these thermosetting resins
are “cured” by the use of a catalyst, heat, or a combination of the two. Once cured,
the solid thermoset resins cannot be converted back to their original liquid form.
Unlike thermoplastic resins, cured thermosets will not melt and ﬂow but will soften
when heated (and lose hardness) and once formed, they cannot be reshaped.
Thermoplastic resins, on the other hand, become soft when heated and may be
shaped or molded while in a heated semiﬂuid state and become rigid when cooled.
Maximum continuous-use temperatures of the various types of thermoset and
thermoplastic resins are shown in Table 6.1.

6.3.4.1 Thermoset Resins
Thermosets are cross-linked polymers cured or set using heat or heat and pressure,
which once cured cannot be remelted or reformed. During curing, they form three-
dimensional molecular chains, called cross-links, as shown in Fig. 6.8. The higher
the number of cross-linkings, the more rigid and thermally stable the materials will
be. Cured thermoset resins may soften when heated but do not melt or ﬂow. They
generally show a higher resistance to heat than thermoplastics. Because thermosets
are brittle, they are used with ﬁller materials such as powders and ﬁbers to provide
improved strength and/or stiffness [27–30]. Fibers can be either chopped or wound,

and commonly include glass, glass ﬁbers, or cloth. Some products contain solid
lubricant ﬁllers such as graphite and molybdenum disulﬁde. Others contain aramid
ﬁbers, metal powders, or inorganic ﬁllers with ceramics and silicates.
Thermoset resins provide easy processability and better ﬁber impregnation
because the liquid resin is used at room temperature for various processes such as
ﬁlament winding, pultrusion, RTM, and reaction injection molding (RIM). Ther-
mosets offer greater thermal and dimensional stability, better rigidity, and higher
electrical, chemical, and solvent resistance. Some examples of the most common
resins used in thermoset composites are epoxy, polyester, vinyl ester, phenolics,
cyanate esters, bismaleimides, and polyurethane. Some of the basic properties of
thermoset resins are listed in Table 6.2.
1. Polyester resins
Polyester resins are formed by reacting a diacid and a dialcohol by condensation
polymerization to form an ester. Orthophthalic polyesters are prepared by com-
bining phthalic anhydride with either maleic anhydride or fumaric acid. A com-
bination using isophthalic acid or terephthalic acid results in an isophthalic
polyester, which has better thermal stability, chemical resistance, and mechanical
properties than an orthophthalic polyester, although the cost is higher. The number
of repeating units in a typical polyester is in the range 10–100. Because double-
bonded carbon–carbon bonds are called unsaturated bonds, the thermoset polyesters
containing these bonds are called unsaturated polyesters [31–34]. After the poly-
merization and depending on the number of units, a highly viscous liquid may
result. For further processing, the polyesters are dissolved in low molecular weight
monomers such as styrene (the most widely used), also known as solvents.
Unsaturated polyesters usually contain 35–50 % monomer by weight.
Polyesters are cured by using organic peroxides as initiators such as methyl ethyl
ketone peroxide (MEKP) and benzoyl peroxide (BPO). The initiator reacts with the
carbon–carbon double bond forming a new bond and another free radical on the
carbon (Fig. 6.9). This new radical reacts with another carbon–carbon double bond
to form a new bond and another free radical. A typical concentration of initiators is
1–2 %. Higher or lower concentrations of the initiator will result in incomplete
cross-linking with inferior properties. Cross-linking takes place when the car-
bon–carbon double bonds from separate molecules are linked together, creating a
giant three-dimensional molecule, which increases the molecular weight of the
polymer. Monomers also take part in the cross-linking reaction because they

contain active carbon–carbon double bonds and serve as bridges between polyester
molecule chains. One disadvantage of the solvents is that they are volatile and their
vapors are deposited in the environment when processing. One advantage of
polyester is that cross-linking does not generate by-products, which renders
molding easy. (This is true for epoxies and vinyl esters as well) [5].
The mobility of molecules decreases with increase in molecular weight, and the
viscosity increases; consequently, the reaction stops when free radicals are pre-
vented from ﬁnding new double bonds. An increase in temperature during the
curing process will allow for increased mobility and the creation of more free
radicals. Postcuring is a process that increases the Tg of a resin because it allows the
completion of cross-linking by eliminating reactive sites. Often, the highest tem-
perature reached by a room-temperature cross-linking polyester (with exothermic
curing) will become its Tg [12].
Mechanical properties of cured polyester resins are affected by the monomer
type and amount, acids, and curing temperatures. Orthophthalic polyesters are the
least expensive form of unsaturated polyesters, but they have limited mechanical
properties and sensitivity to environmental conditions. Isophthalic polyesters are
more costly, but they show higher tensile and ﬂexural properties because of the
higher molecular weight and higher number of linear chains [3]. The reaction
between a polyester resin and a free radical (provided by the catalyst) is shown in
Fig. 6.9.

linking reaction

2. Vinyl ester resins
Vinyl ester resins are obtained by reacting an unsaturated acid with an epoxy. The
reaction of methacrylic acid and bisphenol-A (BPA) epoxy resin dissolved in
styrene monomer is the most common version of vinyl esters [35]. An advantage of
vinyl esters is that the cross-linking reaction is identical to the free radical cross-
linking of unsaturated polyesters. The structure of the BPA vinyl ester is shown in
Fig. 6.10. The cross-linking density of BPA vinyl esters decreases with increase in
the molecular weight of the epoxy because the methacrylate sites of cross-linking
are at the ends of the molecular chain.
Novolac epoxy vinyl ester resins offer an increased number of cross-linking sites
along the backbone, which increases the ﬁnal Tg of the resin and temperature
resistance. The cross-linking reaction of vinyl esters is identical to the free radical
cross-linking of unsaturated polyesters, and the reaction also uses similar initiators
and inhibitors. The doubly bonded carbon–carbon is located at the end of the units
only (Fig. 6.10). MEKP, BPO, and Trigonox are common catalysts for vinyl esters
used from 1 to 2 % volume. Trigonox catalyst is known for its nonfoaming char-
acter with vinyl esters. Cobalt naphthalene is a promoter and is usually added to the
resin at 0.2–0.4 % by weight.
Vinyl esters are well known for the resistance to environmental conditions
because their high reactivity achieves complete curing more easily and rapidly than
for polyesters. Vinyl esters show higher elongation at break than polyesters, which
also makes them tougher. The chemical resistance of vinyl esters is generally
greater than that of polyesters because of the inﬂuence of the methyl group [5].
3. Epoxy resins
Epoxy resins generally consist of the three-membered epoxy group ring. The most
common type of epoxy used is the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA)
(Fig. 6.11). Epoxy groups could be located in different locations other than the ends
[31]. At least two epoxy groups have to be on the polymer molecule for
Fig. 6.10 Bisphenol-A vinyl ester

cross-linking. Epoxies usually show high viscosities at room temperature; therefore,
diluents that also contain epoxide groups are used to lower the viscosity.
Hardeners are used to cross-link epoxies. Amine hardeners are the most common.
A hardener should be added in amounts such that the number of epoxide groups is
equivalent to the number of cross-linking sites provided by the hardener [5]. If the
hardener is added in appropriate amounts, a well-cross-linked structure with maxi-
mum properties will result. Some epoxies are formulated to cross-link at room
temperature, but most epoxies used in composite applications require high tem-
peratures to initiate the cross-linking [3]. Physical and mechanical properties are also
improved by increasing the molecular weight when curing. In the case of polyester
resins, no condensation by-products are formed during epoxy curing reactions.
The toughness of the epoxies depends on the length of the polymer chain
between the epoxy groups. Longer chains (higher molecular weight) result in
tougher polymers. One disadvantage of long chains is that there are a small number
of cross-links per unit length (low cross-link density), which results in less stiff and
less strong materials, with lower modulus and heat resistance. Rubber polymers are
added to epoxy resins to increase the toughness.
Epoxies are usually more expensive than unsaturated polyesters, but show
important advantages. Epoxies are stronger, stiffer, tougher, more durable, and
more solvent resistant and have a higher maximum operating temperature than
polyester thermosets [5].

4. Polyurethane resins
Polyurethane resins can be either thermoset or thermoplastic. Polyurethanes are
formed by reacting two monomers, each with at least two reactive groups. Polyol
and isocyanate monomers are generally liquids that are combined to form the
polyurethane. A typical polyurethane molecule can be seen in Fig. 6.12. Polyure-
thanes are very versatile polymers. The role of the polyol in polyurethane chemistry
is like the role of the epoxy molecule in epoxy chemistry. The role of the isocyanate
in polyurethane chemistry is similar to that of the hardener in epoxy chemistry.
Polyols have OH groups at the ends of the branches. Polyurethanes show superior
toughness and elongation to failure; therefore, they are used in the automotive
industry, for example, to manufacture car bumpers [36]. Mechanical properties of
polyurethanes will depend on the type of the monomer used. Ether-based poly-
urethanes show the highest mechanical properties and are also known for their short
and fast solidiﬁcation times, which makes them suitable for processing methods
with faster injection times, such as RIM in comparison with RTM [31]. There are
semirigid and rigid polyurethanes. A low Tg caused by the ﬂexible polyol chains is
a characteristic of semirigid polyurethanes, which results in good ﬂexibility. Rigid
polyurethanes can be used at temperatures up to 150 °C because of the cross-link
structure of the matrix material [3].
5. Phenolic resins
Phenolics are a class of resins commonly formed by the reaction of phenol (carbolic
acid) and formaldehyde, and catalyzed by an acid or a base. Urea, resorcinol, or
melamine can be used instead of phenol to obtain different properties. Their curing
characteristics are different from other thermosetting resins such as epoxies because

water is generated during the curing reaction. Phenolics are used for aircraft interiors,
stowbins, and galley walls, as well as other commercial markets that require low-cost,
ﬂame-resistant, and low-smoke products. Pigmented applications are limited to red,
brown, or black colors [37–41].
Phenolic composites have many desirable performance qualities, including high
temperature resistance, creep resistance, excellent thermal insulation and sound
damping properties, corrosion resistance, and excellent ﬁre/smoke/smoke toxicity
properties. Phenolics are used for various composite manufacturing processes such
as ﬁlament winding, RTM, injection molding, and compression molding. Phenolics
provide easy processability, tight tolerances, reduced machining, and high strength.
Because of their high temperature resistance, phenolics are used in exhaust com-
ponents, missile parts, manifold spacers, commutators, and disc brakes.
6. Cyanate ester resins
Cyanate esters offer excellent strength and toughness, better electrical properties,
and lower moisture absorption compared to other resins. If they are formulated
correctly, their high-temperature properties are similar to bismaleimide and poly-
imide resins. They are used for a variety of applications, including in spacecrafts,
aircrafts, missiles, antennae, radomes, microelectronics, and microwave products.
Cyanate esters are formed by the reaction of bisphenol esters and cyanic acid that
cyclotrimerize to produce triazine rings during the second curing. Cyanate esters are
more easily cured than epoxies. The toughness of cyanate esters can be increased by
adding thermoplastics or spherical rubber particles.
7. Bismaleimide resins
Bismaleimide is produced by a vinyl-type polymerization of a prepolymer termi-
nated with two maleimide groups. Bismaleimide has an intermediate temperature
capability (between epoxy and polyimide). Monomers are usually synthesized from
maleic anhydride and an aromatic diamine; the bismaleamic acid formed is cyc-
lodehydrated to a bismaleimide resin. The double bond of the maleimide is very
reactive and can undergo chain extension reactions. These addition-type polyimides
or maleimide-based polyimides are used in high-performance structural composites
requiring higher-temperature use and increased toughness. Bismaleimides are
hardly used in their pure solid form. In most applications, they come in conjunction
with reactive comonomers (e.g., vinyl and allyl compounds, allyl phenols, and
aromatic amines). A great advantage of these mixtures over the pure powder is
better processability. With the help of comonomers, bismaleimide powders can be
turned into paste-like liquids and cast to the desired shape. However, the viscosity
of such systems is often very high so that solvents are added in order to make
processing easier or even to make processing possible at all. A typical ﬁeld of
application of such bismaleimide systems is their use as matrix resins for high-
performance ﬁber-reinforced composite materials in the aviation and space indus-
tries. Very often, these matrix resins require high curing temperatures (more than
200 °C) and long curing times.

6.3.4.2 Thermoplastic Resins
Thermoplastic resins are materials that soften when heated and harden again when
cooled. These materials are, in general, ductile and tougher than thermoset resins
and are used for a wide variety of nonstructural applications without ﬁllers and
reinforcements [42–45]. Thermoplastics can be melted by heating and solidiﬁed by
cooling, which render them capable of repeated reshaping and reforming. Ther-
moplastic molecules do not cross-link, and therefore, they are ﬂexible and
reformable. Thermoplastics can be either amorphous or semicrystalline, as shown in
Fig. 6.13.
After the rapid development of new types of ﬁbers with extremely good prop-
erties during the ﬁnal decades of the last century, the commercial availability of
thermoplastic matrix composites represents an important recent innovation in the
ﬁeld of composites. The success of these composites can be attributed to different
reasons and is interesting from the viewpoint of fabrication technologies, eco-
sustainability of the entire process, and ﬁnal performances.
In particular, the use of thermoplastic matrices avoids the presence of dangerous
vapors in the working spaces in comparison with those encountered in the case of
thermosetting matrices. This represents a strong environmental improvement and an
economical challenge for the fabrication, the latter being further strongly improved
if one considers the necessity of expensive hardware and procedures needed in the
use of prepreg thermosetting composites. Thermoplastic composites imply the
reversibility of thermal actions on materials during fabrication of the ﬁnal element.
In other words, it is possible to prefabricate semiﬁnished items and later take them
to ﬁnal shape and dimensions without any time limit. Several thermoplastic poly-
mers can be considered as possible matrices for composites, and many innovations
are expected in the near future.

Presently, the most interesting polymers for actual applications are polyethylene,
polypropylene, polyester, nylon, polycarbonate, polyetherimide, poly(phenylene
sulﬁde), and poly(ether ether ketone), which are produced in different places in the
world. There are also producers of various semiﬁnished products using these
matrices, which can be used to produce the ﬁnal elements [46–58]. Some typical
properties of common thermoplastic matrices are listed in Table 6.3.
1. Polyethylene
Polyethylene, which is a semicrystalline polymer with a linear molecular structure of
repeating –CH2–CH2– units, is the most commonly used plastic in the world. In
general, polyethylene is considered as a strong lightweight thermoplastic with very
good chemical resistance. Further, the polymer elongates before breaking, which
enhances the toughness of the porous parts made from polyethylene. Polyethylene is
classiﬁed into several categories based mostly on its density and branching. The
mechanical properties of polyethylene signiﬁcantly depend on variables such as the
extent and type of branching, crystal structure, and molecular weight. Products made
from standard polyethylene grades typically have pore size diameters ranging from 7
to 150 μm. Polyethylene is resistant to concentrated acids, alkalis, and many organic
solvents. Depending on the crystallinity and molecular weight, Tm and Tg may or may
not be observable. The temperatures at which these occur vary strongly with the type
of polyethylene. For common commercial grades of medium- and high-density
polyethylene, Tm is typically in the range 120–130 °C. The Tm for average com-
mercial low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is typically 105–115 °C.
2. Polypropylene
Polypropylene is in many respects similar to high-density polyethylene. However,
instead of forming a long polymer chain made up of repeating –CH2– components,
the polypropylene molecule has a series of CH3 groups that hang off the main
carbon backbone. In isotactic polypropylenes, the CH3 groups are oriented on one
side of the carbon backbone. This orientation creates a greater degree of

crystallinity, making polypropylene stiffer and more resistant to creep (the tendency
to ﬂow under stress) than polyethylene. Generally, polypropylene has demonstrated
certain advantages in terms of improved strength, stiffness, and higher-temperature
capability over polyethylene. Because of its high speciﬁc strength, polypropylene
has been very successfully applied to the formation of ﬁbers, which is the single
largest use of polypropylene. Available in molded shapes, sheets, and tubes, the
nominal pore size in polypropylene ranges from 80 to 150 μm. Polypropylene is
highly resistant to most acids and alkalis and is resistant to most organic solvents
below 80 °C. When not under stress, polypropylene may be used at temperatures
ranging from 93 to 149 °C. Further, polypropylene can normally be subjected to
steam sterilization. Polypropylene is an inexpensive, ductile, low-strength material
with reasonable outdoor performance. The material surface is soft wax like and
scratches easily. Stiffness and strength are often improved by reinforcement with
glass, chalk, or talc. Polypropylene is opaque and white, but the material can be
dyed in many colors.
3. Nylon
Nylon was the ﬁrst commercially successful synthetic polymer. There are two
common methods of making nylon for ﬁber applications. In one approach, mole-
cules with an acid (COOH) group on each end are made to react with molecules
containing amine (NH2) groups on each end. The resulting nylon is named on the
basis of the number of carbon atoms separating the two acid groups and the two
amines. The product consists of monomers of intermediate molecular weight, which
then undergo reaction to form long polymer chains. Nylon ﬁbers are used in many
applications, including fabrics, bridal veils, carpets, musical strings, and rope. Solid
nylon is used for mechanical parts such as machine screws, gears, and other low-to-
medium-stress components previously cast in metal. Engineering-grade nylon is
processed by extrusion, casting, and injection molding. Nylon can be used as a
matrix in composite materials, with reinforcing ﬁbers such as glass or carbon ﬁber,
and has a higher density than pure nylon. Such thermoplastic composites (25 %
glass ﬁber) are frequently used in car components next to the engine, such as intake
manifolds; good heat resistance properties of the composites make them feasible
competitors to metals.
4. Polyester
Polyesters as thermoplastics may change shape after the application of heat. While
combustible at high temperatures, polyesters tend to shrink away from ﬂames and
self-extinguish upon ignition. Polyester ﬁbers have high tenacity and elastic mod-
ulus as well as low water absorption and minimal shrinkage in comparison with
other industrial ﬁbers.
5. Polyphenylene sulﬁde
Polyphenylene sulﬁde is an engineering high-performance thermoplastic with a
maximum crystallinity of 65 %. Polyphenylene sulﬁde can be molded, extruded, or
machined to high tolerances. In its pure solid form, it is opaque white to light tan in
6.3
Type of Matrix
201

color. The maximum service temperature is 218 °C. Polyphenylene sulﬁde has not
been found to dissolve in any solvent at temperatures below approximately 200 °C.
Polyphenylene sulﬁde is one of the most important high-temperature polymers
because it exhibits a number of desirable properties. These properties include
resistance to heat, acids, and alkalis, and to mildew, to bleaches, aging, sunlight,
and abrasion. It absorbs only small amounts of solvents and resists dyeing. Poly-
phenylene sulﬁde-based composites are used for applications in which great
strength and chemical resistance are required at elevated temperatures.
6. Poly(ether ether ketone)
Poly(ether ether ketone) is a semicrystalline high-temperature (up to 500 °F)
engineering thermoplastic, which is excellent for applications where thermal,
chemical, and combustion properties (UL ﬂammability rating of V-0) are critical.
At the same time, poly(ether ether ketone) emits little smoke or toxic gas when
exposed to ﬂame. This material is tough, strong, and rigid and has superior creep
resistance. It also resists radiation and a wide range of solvents. With its resistance
to hydrolysis, poly(ether ether ketone) can withstand boiling water and superheated
steam used in autoclaves and sterilization equipment at temperatures higher than
482 °F. Poly(ether ether ketone) resins are available as unreinforced, 30 % glass
ﬁber-reinforced, 30 % carbon ﬁber reinforced, and HPV-reinforced grades (bearing
grade). Typically, the polymer ﬁnds applications in automotive, marine, nuclear, oil
well, electronics, medical, and aerospace industries.
7. Polyetherimide
Polyetherimide is considered as an advanced thermoplastic with both ether links
and imide groups in its polymer chain. Polyetherimide is an amorphous high-
performance polymer characterized by excellent thermal properties, good chemical
resistance, inherent ﬂame retardancy, and exceptional dimensional stability.
Polyetherimide also exhibits high tensile strength without the use of reinforcement,
very low smoke emission, and excellent hydrolytic stability. Because of polye-
therimide’s high stability, its range of processing is wider than that of many other
thermoplastics.
8. Polycarbonate
Polycarbonate is a versatile tough plastic used for a variety of applications ranging
from bulletproof windows to compact disks (CDs). The main advantage of poly-
carbonate over other types of plastics is its unbeatable strength combined with light
weight. While acrylic is 17 % stronger than glass, polycarbonate is nearly
unbreakable. Bulletproof windows and enclosures seen inside banks or at drive-
throughs are often made of polycarbonate. In addition, polycarbonate is merely one-
third the weight of acrylic, or one-sixth as heavy as glass, and the only drawback is
that it is more expensive than either acrylic or glass. Polycarbonate is also used in
the electronics industry. Apple’s original iMac featured polycarbonate mixed with
clear colors for a transparent computer case. Many cell phones, pagers, and laptops
also use clear or opaque polycarbonate in their casings.

lights, outdoor ﬁxtures, and medical industry applications, though the list is vir-
tually
endless.

6.4 Open Molding Process
Open molding, also known as contact molding, open laminating, and wet layup, is a
method that has been used for the longest time in the polymer–matrix composite
industry to make thermoset composite products. It continues to be the preferred
process used for the production of a wide range of composite products. It is a simple
process with many advantages and uses relatively basic material technology and
processing methods. The molding method involves placing reinforcements and
liquid resin onto the surface of an open mold (which may or may not be precoated
with a gel coat) or onto other substrates as in the case of making a one-off sandwich
construction, on-site repairs by applying a reinforcing vacuum-formed acrylic,
corrosion-resistant lining on steel, on-site repairs of tanks and pipes, and so on.
The hand layup version involves applying the reinforcements and the resin by
hand, while the spray-up version uses tailored spray equipment to deposit both the
reinforcements and the resin on the mold or an alternative substrate. Open molding
is a process typically used for low-to-medium-sized series (from a few to 200–300
parts/y), offering a number of process and product advantages. Producing large
complicated shapes as well as smaller and simpler composite products is possible.
The hand layup process involves low investment costs and little prior working
knowledge of the process, while spray-up involves some investment in the tailored
spray-up machines and spray guns.
The open mold process is performed in molds made from the same resins and
ﬁberglass reinforcements used in the parts produced in the molds. The molds are
created over a simple form, e.g., a professional CNC cut model or a simple
handmade shape of a screen covered with Bondo Body Filler. In either case, the
mold is created by applying a gel coat over the model, after which sheets of
ﬁberglass wetted with the catalyzed resin is applied in individual layers that are
built up by hand until the desired mold thickness is achieved. Simultaneously, a
basic steel or wood frame is fastened to the back of the mold to provide support and
to position in an ergonomic manner for producing parts within.
Initially, the open mold process is facilitated by brushing a layer of gel coat into
the mold, which creates the actual exterior ﬁnish of the ﬁnal molded part. Then,
sheets of ﬁberglass mat are wetted by brushing catalyzed resin over the mat and the
wetted resin and ﬁberglass are rolled tight against the gel coat and the additional
subsequent layers to ensure that the air within is removed. This is done using a
roller similar to a paint roller controlled by the operator manually to roll the wetted
6.3
Type of Matrix
203

glass mat so that the entrapped air is eliminated. Developments in the 1970s pro-
vided equipment that can spray the gel coat and the resin with chopped ﬁberglass
into the mold, which signiﬁcantly improved the application time. However, the
ﬁber and resin still needed to be “rolled” by the operator to eliminate entrapped air
and to smooth the backside of the part.
The open mold process is able to cure at room temperature without added heat or
pressure, and the actual process will require 4–6 h from start to ﬁnish for each
molding produced. Well-trained operators and dedicated facilities are required to
produce the components and products with high quality. The methods of open mold
fabrication include the following:
• Wet layup
• Hand layup
• Spray-up
• Tape layup
• Filament winding
• Autoclave curing.
6.4.1 Wet Layup
In this process, there is usually only one half of the mold and the item to be
produced takes the form of this mold. The resin possesses low viscosity without
ﬁllers and many additives, and it is spread on the continuous glass ﬁbers stationed
in the mold. This technique is widely used; however, health and safety consider-
ations arising because of styrene emissions prompt users to move away from this
method. The reinforcement is placed into or against the mold, and the resin is forced
between the ﬁbers by using brushes or rollers. There are minimal capital investment
costs other than appropriate ventilation, extraction, labor, and tools. Normally,
curing occurs at room temperature. This method is particularly suitable for one-off
or small number production.
The ﬁber is positioned in or on the mold by hand. If the mold shows a complex
shape, small pieces of mat are cut to ﬁt, and then, more layers are applied to achieve
the required thickness. The liquid resin is poured over the ﬁber and rolled to ensure
complete wetting of the ﬁber and removal of air bubbles. In general, the resin cures
at room temperature with the use of an accelerator and a catalyst. If a hot cure is
used, the use of an accelerator is not required. Postcuring of cold-cured laminates is
recommended (typically 2 h at 80 °C or 16 h at 40 °C depending on the resin type).
Prior to the application of the ﬁber and resin, the mold cavity is coated with
either polyvinyl alcohol or a nonsilicon wax to aid the component release. Release
is simply achieved by tapping the wedges between the mold and the component or
by the use of compressed air to gently force the pieces apart.
Chopped strand mat is most commonly used, although woven roving is used
when stronger and stiffer laminates are required. A gel coat is applied to the mold
204

surface to produce a resin with rich and smooth surface for aesthetic purposes and
to protect from the environment. For improved surface ﬁnish and corrosion resis-
tance, a surface veil is used, which is applied with an embedded fabric for rein-
forcement or mixed with resin for smooth surface.
The advantage of wet layup is that it is a simple technique requiring low capital
investment and no requirement for highly skilled labor. The disadvantages are that
it is not suited for strength- or weight-critical primary structure because the ﬁber
orientation and local resin content cannot be controlled well. The nature of the wet
layup also has health and safety implications because the vapors from low
molecular weight monomers can be harmful.
Vacuum-assisted wet layup can help prevent the presence of voids caused by air
trapping in the laminate. By applying vacuum to the part after reducing layup voids,
consolidation is improved. The part is sealed within a plastic ﬁlm (bagging mate-
rial), and the air is extracted using a vacuum pump.
6.4.2 Hand Layup
Hand layup involves open contact molding in one-sided molds and is the most
inexpensive and most common process used for making composite products. This is
the most common method used for producing composite parts in the US aircraft
industry.
In a typical open mold application, the mold is ﬁrst waxed and sprayed with a gel
coat. It may then be cured in a heated oven at approximately 120 °F. In the spray-up
process, after the gel coat cures, catalyzed resin (usually polyester or vinyl ester
with a viscosity of 500–1,000 cps) is sprayed into the mold along with chopped
carbon ﬁbers. A chopper gun chops the roving directly into the resin spray so that
all the materials are simultaneously applied to the mold. Using low-styrene and
suppressed-styrene resins, ﬁllers, and high-volume/low-pressure spray guns or
pressure-fed resin roller applicators helps reduce emissions of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs).
In the hand layup processing, carbon ﬁber continuous strand mats and/or other
fabrics such as woven roving are manually placed in the mold. Each ply is sprayed
with the catalyzed resin (with a viscosity of 1,000–1,500 cps), and the resin is
worked into the ﬁber with brushes and rollers to wet out and compact the laminate.
There are several variations of the hand layup technique, as shown in Fig. 6.14.
The ﬁber content can be increased by up to 50 % by curing the part in a vacuum
bag using a vacuum of 2–14 psi and curing temperatures under 350 °F. Vacuum-
assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) and infusion molding systems are gaining
favor with open mold processors who want to reduce emissions of VOCs. The
applied vacuum compacts the preform and helps the resin to penetrate and wet out
the ﬁber preform. Fiber contents up to 70 % have been reported.
Also, this is the oldest and the simplest method of making polyester composites
and is still extensively used. The molds can be made from sheet metal, wood,
6.4
Open Molding Process
205

plaster, or even composites. The ﬁrst step is to coat the mold with a mold-release
agent so that the cured item can be removed from the mold without damage.
Fluorocarbons are preferably used for this purpose, although silicones are used
when the surface ﬁnish is not of primary importance. Silicones leave residues on
surfaces that cause problems with subsequent bending or painting. Polyvinylalcohol
can also be used as a mold-release agent. The second step is to apply a 0.3–0.4-mm-
thick gel coat layer to the surface. This affords a smooth surface ﬁnish and good
appearance to the product and prevents moisture diffusion, which weakens the
resin–ﬁber interface. After the gel coat has partially cured, an initial coat of the resin
is brushed upon the gel coat, followed by manual laying up the reinforcements such
as a mat, woven roving, or fabric. The entrapped air is removed by hand rollers,
which also ensure complete ﬁber wetting. Successive layers of reinforcements and
resin can be alternatingly added to build up the desired thickness. Curing takes
place at room temperature using a proper initiator such as MEKP.
6.4.2.1 Laminate Materials
There are an inﬁnite number of laminate types that can be developed [59–67].
These materials can be categorized into three basic areas, i.e., core materials, high-
strength and stiffness skins, and outer protective layers. Core materials typically
serve the function of connecting and spacing the skins to develop stiffness and
strength in a sandwich arrangement. The key property of core materials is shear
strength, which ensures shear conductivity between the skins; thus, the ability to
sustain loads and bending is ensured. Core materials are normally wood, honey-
comb, and structural foams. The outer structural layer or skins are traditionally
either metals or composites, either in combination with a core material or a mul-
titude of layers of high strength and stiffness. Composite materials offer the widest
range of high-strength skins with the ability to change the ﬁber type (ﬁberglass,
carbon, and aramid) in addition to the ﬁber volume and orientation. Composites are
Fig. 6.14 Hand layup process
206
6
Manufacture of Carbon Fiber Composites

well suited for large deﬂection applications requiring high strain capability and
fatigue. Typically, they are more corrosion and environmentally resistant than
metals. Composite materials in a lamina form are applied in the form of precured
prepregs or as “B stage” and wet layup conﬁgurations. The ﬁnal group of laminae is
composed of thermoplastic and thermoset materials, which act as a covering to the
laminate structure. In some applications, a plastic ﬁlm or coating is incorporated
into the laminate structure to protect the structure from impact and environmental
effects.
Hand layup is also the oldest and simplest method used for producing reinforced
plastic laminates. The capital investment for hand layup processes is relatively low.
The most expensive piece of equipment typically is a spray gun for resin and gel
coat application. Some fabricators pour or brush the resin into the molds so that a
spray gun is not required for this step. There is virtually no limit to the size of the
part that can be made. The molds can be made of wood, sheet metal, plaster, and
FRP composites.
In a particular hand layup process (otherwise known as wet layup), high-solu-
bility resin is sprayed, poured, or brushed into a mold. The reinforcement is then
wetted with resin and then placed in the mold. Depending upon the thickness or the
density of the reinforcement, the reinforcement may receive additional resin to
improve the wetting and allow for better drapeability into the mold surface. The
reinforcement is then rolled, brushed, or applied using a squeegee to remove
entrapped air and to compact it against the mold surface.
Chopped strand mat is the most inexpensive form of reinforcement used in wet
layup. It also provides equal reinforcing strength in all directions because of the
random orientation of the ﬁbers forming the mat. Woven roving is especially
suitable for thick laminates requiring greater strength. Woven fabric and braid can
also provide inexpensive reinforcement. Once the reinforcement is thoroughly
wetted with the resin, it can be easily formed into complex shapes.
6.4.2.2 Surface Preparation and Bonding
A key step to achieve successful lamination is the bonding process of the layers.
There are three basic components [68–70] of the bonding process. First is the
surface preparation of the laminae, which improves the ability of the substrate to
accept and adhere to an adhesive. Surface preparation varies depending on the
material type. Composites use sanding and grinding, surface texturing, or solvent
cleaning. The second component is the adhesive itself, including epoxies, ure-
thanes, phenolics, polyesters, solvents, and acrylics. Each adhesive consists of its
own attributes depending on the substrate type, in-use requirements, and process
constraints. As a general rule, the maximum bond is achieved for a given substrate
type when the material itself fails during an ultimate strength test. The maximum
lap shear strength of an adhesive is achieved when the adhesive exhibits a cohesive
failure in the bond line. The third component of lamination is the process by which
the materials are bonded together. This involves a host of parameters, primarily
6.4
Open Molding Process
207

time, heat, pressure, mixture, moisture, and catalysts (initiators). It is important that
the three basic components of bonding are properly employed to achieve successful
lamination.
6.4.2.3 Laminate Construction
There are three types of laminated construction [71–74]. These include sandwich
lamination consisting of at least two high-stiffness and high-strength outer layers
connected by a core, all laminated construction consisting of relatively high-stiff-
ness and high-strength layers, and a third type consisting of a structural member
reinforced on the tensile or compression or both sides of a ﬂexural beam.
Sandwich lamination constructions are found in many applications ranging from
satellite structures to snow skis. Both applications may use a sandwich approach;
however, satellites generally require stiffness, strength, and extreme lightweight,
while the snow ski requires the laminated beam or composite structure to withstand
large deﬂections and dynamic performance requirements. In addition, the ski
structure is integrated with thermoplastic surfaces and metal components. Typi-
cally, metal and composite materials are applied to these sandwich structures. Even
complex shapes can be achieved by using composite prepregs and wet layups.
All laminate constructions use relatively high-strength and high-stiffness mate-
rials. An array of laminate conﬁgurations is possible. In aerospace applications,
multiple plys are orientated in various directions to provide customized structural
strength and stiffness. These principles, although at a less complex level, are used in
automotive, industrial, and recreational products in the form of structural members,
springs, archery limbs, and bicycles.
6.4.2.4 Multi-ply Construction
The third type of laminated construction is used most often in construction and
infrastructure applications [75–77]. Till date, reinforcements have been integrated
into glue-laminated wood beams (Glu-Lams) and infrastructure components for
fabricating columns, beams, and walls. In many of these applications, reinforce-
ment, most typically composites, is used via lamination to the tensile side of a beam
or as a wrap on a column. Precured prepreg or wet layup composite materials have
all been used in these applications. These types of reinforcements improve the
strength of laminated wood beams and/or reduce the use of E-rated lumber with less
costly new growth wood. Lamination in bridges and buildings provide a low-cost
simpliﬁed method to revitalize existing structures and increase the load-carrying
capability and resistance to seismic events.
In the automotive industry, composites are being combined with metals for
performance, weight reduction, and cost advantages. The construction industry is
applying composites to wood-laminated beams and I-joists.
208

Manufacture of Carbon Fiber Composites

The possibilities and advantages of laminated materials are signiﬁcant and
provide solutions to product requirements, generally not achievable by using a
single material. The advantages in structural performance, reduced weight, and
oriented structural properties are some advantages of this approach. In many cases,
the result is a simpliﬁed and less costly solution to many engineering structural
problems.
6.4.3 Spray Layup
Spray layup is an open molding composite fabrication process in which the resin
and reinforcements are sprayed onto a mold (Fig. 6.15). The resin and glass may be
applied separately or simultaneously “chopped” in a combined stream from a
chopper gun. Workers roll out the spray layup to compact the laminate. Wood,
foam, or other core materials may then be added, and a secondary spray layup layer
imbeds the core between the laminates (sandwich construction). The part is then
cured, cooled, and removed from the reusable mold.
Spray layup has very little application in aerospace. This technology produces
low-speciﬁc-strength structures, which usually are not manifested in the end
product. Spray layup is being used to join backup structures to composite face
sheets on composite tools. Spray layup is also in limited use for obtaining ﬁberglass
splash from transfer tools.
Spray layup has been designed to process chopped carbon ﬁbers. A specially
designed gun supplies the resin, while chopping the continuous ﬁber. The resin/
ﬁber mix is then sprayed into a mold. Because of the ﬂow requirements in the gun,
high ﬁber densities are not possible. This technique is inexpensive and requires only
a pneumatic ﬁber-chopping tool and a resin sprayer.

Carbon ﬁber is used extensively because it is easily chopped into strands, has
low static, and fast wet-through. Orthophthalic and isophthalic resins such as vinyl
ester or polyester are commonly used owing to their high reactivity. Other examples
include epoxy and phenolic resins.
One major advantage of this technique is that it permits fast application. Also,
the method results in better wetting of the ﬁber with fewer voids than with hand
layup. Consequently, parts with better physical properties are obtained. However,
the method does produce parts with less uniformity, particularly in thickness in
comparison with parts produced by hand layup. The laminates tend to be resin rich
and hence are heavier.
Spray-up requires low molecular weight resin; the styrene emissions can be high,
requiring tight health and safety control. Because the gel and cure result from
exothermic chemical reactions, there is a risk of the resulting exotherm being
excessive, which may result in the damage of the molded part or mold. It is to be
noted that if the ambient temperature is warm, the resin may cure prior to the
completion of the spraying application. Examples of applications include manu-
facture of sanitary ware, caravan bodies, and small dinghies.
6.4.4 Tape Layup
In this method, layers of prepreg (reinforcing phase impregnated by liquid resin)
tape are applied on the mold surface by a tape application robot.
6.4.5 Filament Winding
Filament winding method involves the winding of a continuous ﬁlament of rein-
forcing material onto a rotating mandrel in layers at different layers [78–81]. If a
liquid thermosetting resin is applied on the ﬁlament prior to winding, the process is
called wet ﬁlament winding. If the resin is sprayed onto the mandrel with the wound
ﬁlament, the process is called dry ﬁlament winding. This process is primarily used
for hollow components with circular or ovoid cross sections, such as pipes and
tanks. Fiber tows are passed through a resin bath before being wound onto a
mandrel in a variety of orientations, which are controlled by the ﬁber feeding
mechanism and the rate of rotation of the mandrel.
Although the ﬁlament winding machine design varies with the part geometry,
the basic ﬁlament winding process concept is described in Fig. 6.16.
The ﬁbers are impregnated with a resin (by immersion or by passing over a
resin-wetted drum or by injection into the die) before being led to a feed eye, where
a controlled bandwidth is set prior to positioning on the mandrel.
Fiber tension is critical to the operation of a ﬁlament winding machine. The
ﬁbers are supplied on creels, and it is normal to use ﬁber tensioners (closed-loop
controlled servo-driven “dancers”) in the feed line. The tension required is
210
6
Manufacture of Carbon Fiber Composites

dependent on the type of the ﬁber, part diameter, and winding pattern selected. The
tension directly affects both the ﬁber volume fraction and the fraction of voids,
which, in turn, inﬂuence the strength and stiffness of the composite part.
Once the ﬁber package is positioned, the resin is taken to full cure, often by
heating in an oven. The ﬁnal stage is the mandrel removal, which leaves the desired
hollow component. This may be achieved by hydraulic rams for extracting the steel
mandrels. For more complex structures, the mandrel may be composed of low-
melting-point materials (e.g., a metal alloy) or a water-soluble salt (leachable
plaster), which can be washed out, or a collapsible rubber or nonreusable foam. In
some cases, when a liner is required for minimal gas permeability, the liner may
also function as the mandrel and hence need not be removed.
Filament winding has been combined with other ﬁber application methods such
as hand layup, pultrusion, and braiding. Classic ﬁlament winding involves a spindle
with a carriage or carriages to apply hoop and helical ﬁbers. The compaction is
carried out by ﬁber tension. The resin content is now primarily metered. The
machines are usually computer controlled, with up to six axes independently
monitored. The additional axis comes into play at the ﬁber turnarounds. The extra
head axis allows for better placement of the band and more uniform bandwidth.
Filament winding is typically used in the production of chemical storage tanks
and pipelines, gas cylinders, rocket motors, launch tubes, pressure vessels, drive
shafts, ﬁshing rods, and missile cases.
6.4.6 Autoclave Curing
Besides conventional curing of the molded parts at room temperature, autoclave
curing may be used (Fig. 6.17). Autoclave curing is a method in which a part,
Fig. 6.16 Filament winding process
6.4

molded by one of the open molding methods, is cured by subsequent application of
vacuum, heat, and inert gas pressure. The molded part is ﬁrst placed into a plastic
bag from which air is removed by a vacuum pump. This operation removes air
inclusions and volatile products from the molded part. Then, heat and inert gas
pressure are applied in the autoclave causing curing and densiﬁcation of the
materials.
Autoclave curing enables the fabrication of consistent homogeneous materials.
The method is relatively expensive and is used for manufacturing high-quality
aerospace products. Autoclaves are also used to process both laminated composites
and bonded metallic assemblies such as honeycomb panels. When placed under
vacuum or when vented, the heat and pressure can be adjusted to optimize the ﬁber/
resin ratio in composite parts and provide high-strength bonds (using high-strength
ﬁlm adhesives) in bonded assemblies. Autoclaves have been used in the industry for
many decades. With progress in technology, autoclave design has also progressed.
Figure 6.17 shows popular autoclaves used in recent times.
Beneﬁts of the autoclave cure include the following:
• Achievement of highest strength-to-weight ratio
• Production of high-ﬁber content laminates
• Pressurized curing and reduced voids
• Ability to process large parts or a large number of small parts
• Pressure and heat can be controlled very closely
• Strategic ﬁber placement
• Flatness
Typical applications of autoclave curing include the production of precision
curing parts, aircraft parts, printed circuit boards, laminates, and thermoset com-
ponents for the electronics industry.
6.5 Closed Molding Process
Closed molding comprises a broad category of fabrication processes in which the
composite part is produced in a mold cavity formed by the joining of two or more
tool pieces. There are many variations of the closed molding process, each with its
own unique or distinctive aspect. For the purposes of introduction, these variations
Fig. 6.17 Popular autoclaves used in recent times
212

Manufacture of Carbon Fiber Composites

are categorized into two types: compression molding and liquid injection molding.
Compression molding processes use either SMC or bulk molding compound
(BMC). These compounds contain reinforcing ﬁber, ﬁllers, resin, and curing agents.
High ﬁller contents result in a higher part density than is typical for open molded
parts. Typical cycle times of a few minutes are achieved with a combination of
rapid hydraulic mold closure and curing at elevated temperatures. A large number
of parts (thousands to tens of thousands) are required to justify the required capital
expenditures. Liquid injection molding processes include RIM, structural reaction
injection molding (SRIM), and RTM. The liquid resin injection for RIM and SRIM
begin with an empty mold cavity. RIM and SRIM typically use highly reactive
resins such as urethanes and are well suited for high-rate production. In general,
neither compression molding nor RIM/SRIM is a viable alternative to typical open
mold production. This is primarily caused by the limited production quantities of
typical open molded parts.
The best alternative for close mold production is RTM. For RTM, the liquid
resin injection follows once the mold is ﬁrst loaded with materials such as the
reinforcement ﬁbers and cores. RTM processes produce parts with strengths,
stiffness, and weights that most closely resemble typical open mold parts. Cycle
times can range from a few minutes for small parts to several hours for large parts.
A wide variety of resin chemistries are used according to the design end use
requirements.
6.5.1 Resin Transfer Molding (RTM)
RTM is a particularly useful manufacturing process that uses liquid resin to
impregnate the stationary ﬁbrous preform [82–86]. During the RTM process, the
preform is placed into the mold cavity, the mold is closed, and the resin is injected
into the cavity under pressure. The mold with the preform is often placed under
vacuum so that the vacuum removes all the entrapped air in the preform and speeds
up the RTM process. Once the liquid resin ﬁlls the mold cavity, it cures, during
which the resin hardens because of the formation of a polymeric network, which
forms the matrix of the composites, allowing the part to be demolded. Typically,
thermoset polymers such as epoxy, vinyl ester, methyl methacrylate, polyester, or
phenolic resin are used with ﬁberglass, carbon ﬁber, aramid, and synthetic ﬁber
reinforcements, either individually or in combination with each other. The matrix
selection of the polymer and the reinforcement dictates both the molding material
cost and the molding mechanical and surface ﬁnish performance. Along with the
polymer and reinforcement, the addition of mineral ﬁllers may be used to enhance
ﬁre retardancy, ﬂex modulus, and surface ﬁnish.
This technique is well known and has been traditionally applied to moderately
large parts in various applications. It allows one to obtain even very complex neat
shape parts with good surface ﬁnish, in many cases, at reasonable production rates.
The ﬁber architecture, permeability of the preform and fabric crimps, resin

viscosity, and temperature of operation inﬂuence the wetting of the fabric. Careful
process design is required to reproducibly obtain a high-quality product (Fig. 6.18).
Reinforcements are used in their dry form in the mold as binder-bound chopped
mat, random–continuous strand mat, stitched “conformable” mat, or woven cloth.
The ﬁber has been either “preformed” to the exact shape of the molding tool in a
previous operation or is hand-tailored during the loading process in the molding
tool. After the ﬁber is installed into the mold, a premixed catalyst and resin are

214

Manufacture of Carbon Fiber Composites

injected into the closed mold cavity, encapsulating the ﬁber within. The primary
surface of the molding may be gel coated by spraying the mold surface before
installing the ﬁber. If a gel coat is not required, the exterior ﬁnish would be the
same on both sides of the molded part. RTM is inherently advantageous in the case
of low-pressure injection when the injection pressure usually does not exceed 100
psi during the mold ﬁll process. In most common applications using the RTM
process, parts are molded with a cross-sectional thickness of 4 mm with 30 wt%
ﬁber content of the total laminate.
6.5.1.1 Beneﬁts of Using RTM
• Closed molding process is cleaner and healthier, which attracts higher skilled
employees.
• Closed molding operator turnover is dramatically reduced through improved
working conditions.
• Closed molding area has organized process ﬂow to maximize throughput
efﬁciency.
• Moldings can be manufactured to close dimensional tolerances.
• Components have good surface ﬁnish on both sides.
• Selective reinforcement and accurate ﬁber management is achievable.
• Ability to build in ﬁber volume fraction loadings up to 65 %.
• Consistency in thickness and ﬁber loading, resulting in uniform shrinkage.
• Inserts may be incorporated into moldings.
• Tooling costs are comparatively low compared to other manufacturing
processes.
• Uses only low-pressure injection.
• Low volatile emission during processing.
• Ability to produce near-net-shape moldings, reducing material wastage.
• Process can be automated, resulting in higher production rates with less scrap.
• Ability to mold complex structural and hollow shapes.
• Low void fraction in the molded components.
• Ability to achieve laminate thicknesses in the range 0.1–90 mm.
6.5.1.2 Current RTM Developments
Three primary factors have a major impact on the use of the RTM process today.
(1) Environmental agencies have recently reduced the allowable styrene (primary
VOC contained in the resins used for SMC, open mold, and RTM) level in the
work place to levels that are very difﬁcult to meet using the open molding
process.
(2) The labor force of today is not interested in working in an open mold envi-
ronment. Thus, the skill level needed to maintain the desired or required
6.5
Closed Molding Process
215

product quality and consistency is becoming increasingly rare. The result is an
increase in the production cost attributable to the required “reworking” in a
postmold operation of the products molded to meet quality standards.
(3) The innovation originating from the suppliers of equipment and tooling have
changed the mold design to incorporate the use of vacuum in balance with the
injection pressure, enabling lower-cost tooling because of the reduction in
tooling structure and previously needed external clamping hardware.
6.5.1.3 Background to Current Developments
RTM is facing competition from the open mold and SMC processes, while in most
low-volume applications, open mold tooling is the choice for many applications
because of low costs. The high-volume applications have chosen the SMC process.
Many tooling methods have been attempted in RTM to both increase tool life
and improve surface ﬁnish longevity. There have been efforts to use nickel shell,
cast aluminum, and cut aluminum. The cut aluminum tooling led to cut steel, and
we found that this tooling equals the cost of SMC tooling, and hence, the program
can be used for SMC.
All of this tooling effort or change was in reaction to attempts to improve the
surface quality of the molded parts by improving the damage resistance of the mold
surface. The RTM process began with epoxy tooling surfaces, which led to high-
temperature polyester tooling gel coats to improve, release, and reduce wear caused
by sticking. The high-temperature polyester was easily damaged, which led to the
use of nickel; however, nickel could not be easily repaired, which led to the use of
cast aluminum. Cast aluminum contained too much porosity, which led to the use of
cut billet aluminum. Cut billet aluminum has an excellent surface; however, for
only 20 % more cost, cut steel could be used. However, it is excessively off course
as far as tooling cost is concerned to make the process competitive with either SMC
or open mold.
6.5.2 Light RTM (LRTM)
The light RTM process (also known as LRTM) for the production of ﬁber-rein-
forced composites has recently become the most popular closed molding process
for low-to-medium-volume applications. This leading technology has now dis-
placed the former conventional or traditional RTM in most typical marine, auto-
motive, industrial, and medical composite molding applications, requiring two
ﬁnished sides and close dimensional tolerances.
The recent surge in the acceptance of the LRTM process over the previously
used traditional RTM process is in part because of the lower tooling cost of LRTM.
216
6
Manufacture of Carbon Fiber Composites

In addition, it is also favored because of the ease of converting from the open
molding process, which still remains the prominent molding process in the industry.
The LRTM process is founded on what could be considered as minimal tooling
structure when compared to traditional RTM or other closed molding processes
such as SMC or BMC. The tooling structure needed for the LRTM process is
similar to that of the open molding process because of the minimal internal cavity
pressure. The typical LRTM mold consists of one rigid half, normally for the “A
surface” (typically the female cavity) of the mold, with a lightweight see-through
semiﬂexible upper mold half. Each mold half is made from a thermoset polyester or
vinyl ester tooling gel coat surface with a ﬁberglass-reinforced thermoset polymer
laminate backing, which is then normally supported by steel box tubing to retain the
tooling shape and provide an ergonomic orientation.
LRTM tooling costs are a fraction of the price of equivalent RTM molds; until
recently, they were thought to produce less than half the production rate of the
higher-pressure RTM process. However, with recent innovations in the tool design
and process controls, the gap in productivity is closing between the two processes.
Closed molding for either true RTM or LRTM offers far more comfortable and
healthy working environments for the molding operators. Hence, the operators are
then willing to apply their skills of quality and productivity at a consistently higher
level each day. It is true that LRTM will not meet the production rates offered by
traditional RTM; however, LRTM will provide a 300–400 % increase in per-
square-foot productivity over open mold, with signiﬁcant improvement of bill of
material compliance and lower operator employment turnover.
In LRTM, resin ﬂow rates cannot be accelerated above an optimum level of the
greatest ﬂow rate, while maintaining inner-cavity mold pressures below the
clamping forces of the external atmospheric pressure. Normally, this limits the
injection pressure of the LRTM to less than 1 bar (14 psi), with the cavity held at a
constant vacuum level of −0.5 bar (15″ Hg).
As with any composite closed mold production process method, LRTM
demands high-quality and accurate cross-sectional molds to provide good mold life
and consistent production of repeatable parts. This is a key element to successful
molding and is commonly overlooked by those venturing into either LRTM or
RTM on their own. We strongly encourage those who wish to take advantage of the
closed molding processes of RTM or LRTM to allow us to be a major part of
achieving success.
Today, the industry is directed toward closed molding, especially LRTM, which
is driven by numerous factors such as reduced employee turnover, elimination of
VOC emissions, and improved bill of material compliance combined with two
ﬁnished side moldings that can be engineered to ﬁt into assemblies with far less
manual postmold rework. The pending restrictions on VOC emissions now coming
to an imminent deadline and the most recent threat by the EPA of listing styrene,
the most prominent VOC in the open molding process, as a suspected human
carcinogen, have all aided in the recent increased demand in converting many open
molders to the closed molding process using RTM, LRTM, and vacuum infusion
(VARTM) processes.
6.5
Closed Molding Process
217

6.5.2.1 Comparison of RTM and LRTM Processes
Individual characteristics of each closed molding process can be identiﬁed when the
fundamental differences in the process methods and related limitations are con-
sidered. With traditional RTM, the mold cavity with resin under a moderately high
ﬂow rate and pressure is only limited by the structural ability of the molding tool
and perimeter clamping or press systems to sustain mold closure. Working within
these concerns, RTM tooling and clamping systems can be built with structures
sufﬁcient to sustain the ﬂexing caused by the highest expected injection pressure
during the molding cycle. Thus, we may choose to use tools made of cored com-
posite with a steel tube backing structure or either CNC machine-cut aluminum or
steel.
As with any manufacturing process, cost becomes the true limiting factor. Use of
tooling (molds) made from ﬁberglass-reinforced composite materials is generally
favored to reduce tooling costs in comparison with the alternative of using machine
aluminum or steel materials. Machine-cut steel or aluminum tooling is typically
limited to very high-volume applications, which can amortize the tooling cost over
far more molding cycles.
The shortcoming of the composite tooling is the service life of the mold surface.
Increased tooling surface life has been revolutionized through the use of tooling
with replaceable tooling surface “skins.” Today, there are a number of skin tooling
system designs in the market, which are compatible with RTM and LRTM. One of
the most recent designs is the patented ZIP RTM design offered exclusively through
JHM Technologies Inc. The ability to replace the perishable mold surface through
the use of mold surface “skins” has given composite–ﬁber-reinforced tooling an
effective solution in providing long-lasting tooling and high-quality moldings.
6.5.3 Vacuum-Assisted Resin Transfer Molding
VARTM is perhaps the most discussed among low-pressure closed mold-reinforced
composite molding techniques. VARTM is a single-sided molding process in which
the dry preform (reinforcement or coring materials) is placed into the mold and a
cover (or a vacuum bag) is placed over the top to form a vacuum-tight seal
(Fig. 6.19). A distribution medium (a mesh) is used and laid on top of the top-
release fabric to help maintain an even distribution of the resin and facilitate the
ﬂow of resin through the thickness of the panel. The low-viscosity resin typically
enters the preform through the resin distribution and vacuum distribution lines with
the aid of vacuum. In VARTM, the ﬂow of resin occurs in plane as well as in the
transverse directions to the preform. The permeability of the preform, ﬁber archi-
tecture, and fabric crimp have an inﬂuence on the wetting of the fabric.
VARTM is most accurately applied to the process of vacuum infusion in which
the composites are molded using a rigid mold to provide part geometry and a thin
ﬂexible membrane over the ﬁber, with the outer atmospheric pressure compressing
218
6
Manufacture of Carbon Fiber Composites

the ﬁber tight against the rigid mold surface. However, it should be noted that in
VARTM, vacuum is added at the exit vent of the molding tool, and thus, any form
of RTM in which vacuum is applied to the vent would qualify as VARTM. Often,
the aerospace industry will have very high-ﬁber-volume composites molded within
a rigid matched mold set in which the ﬁxed cavity mold is clamped and closed
using a press and the resin injection pressures typically range below 100 psi,
although the pressure could be as high as 600 psi as in the case of ﬁlling the mold
encapsulating the dry ﬁber within.
The beneﬁts of the VARTM technology include the following:
• VARTM is applicable to larger, less complex, and lower-volume part produc-
tion of composite parts
• VARTM needs simple and low-cost tooling
• Onsite manufacturing and repairing are practical.
• High-ﬁber-volume panels are achievable.
6.5.4 Pultrusion
Pultrusion is a manufacturing process used for producing continuous lengths of
FRP structural shapes (Fig. 6.20). Raw materials include a liquid resin mixture
(containing resin, ﬁllers, and specialized additives) and reinforcing ﬁbers. The
process involves pulling these raw materials (rather than pushing, which is the case
in extrusion) through a heated steel-forming die using a continuous pulling device
[87–92]. The reinforcement materials are in continuous forms such as rolls of
ﬁberglass mat or doffs of ﬁberglass roving. As the reinforcements are saturated with
the resin mixture (termed as wet-out) in the resin impregnator and pulled through
the die, the gelation (or hardening) of the resin is initiated by the heat from the die
and a rigid cured proﬁle is formed, which corresponds to the shape of the die.
The design of the pultrusion machine varies with part geometry; however, the
basic concept of the pultrusion process is described in Fig. 6.20. The creels position
the reinforcements for subsequent feeding into the guides. The reinforcement must

(VARTM) process
6.5
Closed Molding Process
219

be located properly within the composite and controlled by the reinforcement
guides.
The resin impregnator saturates (wets out) the reinforcement with a solution
containing the resin, ﬁllers, pigment, and catalyst, in addition to any other additives
required. The interior of the resin impregnator is carefully designed to optimize the
“wet-out” (complete saturation) of the reinforcements.
On exiting the resin impregnator, the reinforcements are organized and posi-
tioned for the eventual placement within the cross-sectional form by the preformer.
The preformer is an array of toolings, which squeezes away excess resin, while the
product is moving forward and gently shapes the materials prior to entering the die.
In the die, the thermosetting reaction is heat activated (energy is primarily supplied
electrically) and the composite is cured (hardened).
On exiting the die, the cured proﬁle is pulled to the saw for cutting to length. It is
necessary to cool the hot part before it is gripped by the pull block (made of durable
urethane foam) to prevent cracking and/or deformation by the pull blocks. Two
Fig. 6.20 Schematic of pultrusion process
220
6
Manufacture of Carbon Fiber Composites

distinct pulling systems are used: a caterpillar counter-rotating type and a hand-
over-hand reciprocating type.
In certain applications, a radio frequency (RF) wave generator unit is used to
preheat the composite before entering the die. When in use, the RF heater is
positioned between the resin impregnator and the preformer. RF is generally only
used with an all-roving part.
The initial capital investment for pultrusion is generally higher than open mold
or hand layup processes. The primary expense for pultrusion manufacturers is the
material handling guides and die fabrication costs. The net result is a low-cost
process for high volume. The process provides ﬂexibility in the design of the
pultruded proﬁles. Currently, proﬁles up to 72 inch wide and 21 inch high are
possible. Pultrusion can manufacture both simple and complex proﬁles, eliminating
the need for extensive postproduction assembly of components. Because the pro-
cess is continuous, length variations are limited to shipping capabilities. This
process allows for optimized ﬁber architectures with uniform color, eliminating the
need for many painting requirements.
6.5.5 Thermoforming
Thermoforming is a molding process used to form sheets of plastic to a mold
surface by using heat and vacuum and/or pressure force (Fig. 6.21). This tech-
nology appeared to have applications during the prime of thermoplastics. Ther-
moforming is a downstream plastic process; however, it is often viewed as an
alternative to injection molding in numerous markets and end uses.
Thermoforming is used primarily in low-cost applications for simple embossing
of thin plastic sheet and cannot be used to form shapes as rigid as those formed by
vacuum forming. Thermoformed plastics are invariably thermoplastics because
thermosetting plastics assume their ﬁnal shape through heat and cannot be molded
with this process.

6.5
Closed Molding Process
221

Familiar products manufactured by thermoforming include yoghurt pots and
simple trays. The plastics that are used in thermoforming include acrylic, LDPE,
and crystalline polyester (CPET).
6.5.5.1 Types of Thermoforming Molds
(1) Machined aluminum molds
Machined aluminum molds are typically built for shallow parts with small draw
ratios. Male or female molds and vacuum-form or pressure-form molds can be
machined aluminum molds. They can be textured and may offer features such as
loose cores, pneumatic cores, and inserts.
(2) Cast aluminum molds
Cast aluminum molds are cast at a foundry from a machined pattern from a
composite material and are typically built for parts with large draw ratios.
(3) Composite molds
For prototyping and short production runs, cost-efﬁcient composite molds are
used for mold construction. These molds produce parts that are to be evaluated for
ﬁt, form, and function and may be modiﬁed to evaluate possible design changes.
These molds are for vacuum forming only and are not temperature controlled.
These molds have a limited life.
Beneﬁts of thermoforming technology.
• The technology is efﬁcient and very cost-effective
– Lower machine cost
– Large parts can be easily formed
• Offers close tolerances, tight speciﬁcations, and sharp detail
• Much lower initial project costs
• Inexpensive tooling
Typical applications of thermoforming are large panels, housings, enclosures,
children’s swimming pools, small boat hulls, Halloween masks, disposable SOLO
cups, ice cube trays, refrigerator door liners, cookie or donut trays, and Glad-Ware
food containers.
6.5.6 Vacuum Bagging
This process is basically an extension of the wet layup process in which pressure is
applied to the laminate once laid up in order to improve its consolidation
(Fig. 6.22). This is achieved by sealing a plastic ﬁlm over the wet laid-up laminate
222
6
Manufacture of Carbon Fiber Composites

and onto the tool. The air under the bag is extracted by a vacuum pump, and thus,
pressure up to one atmosphere can be applied to the laminate to consolidate it
(Table 6.4).
Beneﬁts of this process:
• Large products possible
• Top-quality products through the use of prepregs
• Clean production method
• Low molding costs
Typical applications are in ﬁelds such as the production of large one-off cruising
boats, racecar components, and core-bonding in production boats.
6.5.7 Compression Molding
In compression molding, two matched (usually steel) mold halves are mounted in a
press (normally hydraulic) with movement limited to the axis normal to the plane of
the mold. This process tends to be associated with a variety of materials, including
(but not limited to) the prepreg continuous ﬁbers in epoxy resin and the prepreg
short ﬁbers in polyester resin [93–99].
6.5.7.1 Sheet Molding Compound (SMC)
The SMC process is a high-temperature process performed in a matched set of steel
molds heated to over 350 °F; the SMC compound is laid in a measured volume in
the heated mold with the required resin, catalyst, mineral ﬁllers, and reinforcement
premixed into the compound in a previous compounding process. Then, the mold is
forced closed under greater than 2,000 psi of pressure squeezing the compound to
ﬁll the entire mold cavity rapidly, enabling curing within 1–3 min. Once cured, the
Fig. 6.22 Schematic of vacuum bagging process
6.5
Closed Molding Process
223

mold is opened and the molding is ejected as a ﬁnished part requiring only minimal
surface preparation prior to ﬁnish painting. One added key advantage of the SMC
process is the ability to mold the part to “net” shape; that is, normally, SMC parts
are molded to the ﬁnal net shape of the part that do not then need postmold
trimming. This eliminates the need to trim parts after molding and provides the
most consistent part-to-part trim repeatability.
The molds may be heated or the composite may be preheated and formed in
relatively cool molds. A limitation of the process is the uniaxial force applied, and
hence, while horizontal surfaces experience compression loads, as the component
surfaces become vertical, there is little or no component of the force acting to
consolidate the material in the vertical plane. Further, near-vertical surfaces may be
subjected to wrinkling during mold closure. These issues may be resolved by the
use of rubber-block molding or hydroforming (pressurized liquid contained in a
ﬂexible membrane) wholly or partially substituting the male molds half.

Manufacture of Carbon Fiber Composites

To aid in the processing of ﬂat products, it is helpful to use a SMC, which can be
made in a manner similar to that of a DMC, although higher concentration of
reinforcement (20 % v/v) and longer staple length (approximately 25 mm) are
achieved. The catalyzed resin is deposited on a polyethylene-release ﬁlm, and the
reinforcement is consolidated by adding a top-release ﬁlm and by passing the
sandwich through a series of rollers to yield an SMC of the required thickness. The
SMC will have a shelf life of approximately 3–6 months at room temperature.
6.5.7.2 Dough Molding Compound (DMC)
Generally used with glass reinforcements, dough is produced using a high-shear
mixer by mixing the resin, catalyst, approximately 10 % v/v of approximately 10-
mm chopped reinforcement, and a release agent (such as zinc stearate) together with
ﬁller and pigment. After mixing, the dough is formed into a rope or billet. DMC has
a lower shelf life than SMC.
6.5.7.3 Bulk Molding Compound (BMC)
BMC is similar to DMC, although BMC uses an improved resin such as an iso-
phthalic polyester. However, the terminology is restricted to the UK, and in the
USA, BMC is identical to DMC.
6.5.7.4 Meeting Demand from the 1970s Through 2012
The automotive industry was served well with the SMC process because their
volume justiﬁed the capital cost associated with the tooling and the high tonnage
presses required. The marine markets could never justify SMC tooling. The varied
marine models, the need to react to nearly constant product changes, and the low
volume need of each of the moldings make the SMC process very impractical for
the marine market, and the open molding is a more practical method for their needs.
If the volume requires more than one molding per shift, then additional molds are
created, each at a very nominal cost; therefore, the open molding process can be
very ﬂexible in meeting the needs of the marine or similar volume markets.
6.5.8 Injection Molding
Injection molding is probably the most extensively used method for processing short
ﬁber-reinforced thermoplastics [100–107]. Injection molding is accomplished by
large injection molding machines such as that shown in Fig. 6.23. Resin is fed to the
machine through the hopper. Colorants are usually fed to the machine directly after
6.5
Closed Molding Process
225

the hopper. The resins enter the injection barrel by gravity though the feed throat.
Upon entrance into the barrel, the resin is heated to the appropriate melting
temperature.
The ﬁber/resin mixture, whether it is preblended or fed as a physical mixture, is
fed into the hopper and transferred into the heated barrel. The material softens by
heat transfer from the barrel wall. At the same time, the screw rotates to apply high
shear to further heat the material and ﬁll the barrel. The molten material is collected
in front of the screw by the rotation of the screw and then injected at high pressure
into the mold cavity through the runner and the gate. The mold is cooled below the
solidiﬁcation temperature of the resin in case of thermoplastic composites. The level
of automation of this method is the highest among many processing methods.
Because of intensive mixing with high shear and passage through a narrow gate,
extensive ﬁber damage occurs; therefore, injection molding of composite materials
is suitable only with short ﬁber-reinforced or particulate-ﬁlled polymers.
There is a critical length of ﬁbers below which the ﬁber length does not degrade.
The critical length is determined by the rheological properties of the composite
mold, ﬁber properties, and instrument factors [108–110]. Less ﬁber damage occurs
when a plunger-type injection molding machine is used rather than a screw-type
injection molding machine. Because the plunger-type injection molding machine
does not achieve a high degree of mixing in the machine, the raw materials must be
thoroughly mixed prior to feeding.
6.5.9 Reaction Injection Molding (RIM)
RIM is widely employed in processing of various thermoset polymers. It usually
contains two or more liquids that are accumulated in a high-pressure mixing unit
and then injected into a mold, where they are polymerized or cured to form a
desired part. Hence, it presents a typical example of a complex nonisothermal and
compressible ﬂow of liquid with reaction taking place at high pressure and high
temperature. Being mostly motivated by practical applications, many researchers
Fig. 6.23 Schematic of
injection molding process
226
6
Manufacture of Carbon Fiber Composites

have made many attempts to describe the residual stresses remaining in the injec-
tion-molded parts experimentally or theoretically.
RIM is one of the more recent processing methods (Fig. 6.24). Instead of using
already polymerized materials such as matrices, highly reactive monomeric or
oligomeric ingredients are placed in two tanks, which are then quickly mixed by
impingement and injected into the mold cavity. As soon as the two materials are
mixed, chemical reaction begins to form a polymeric matrix, which completes
typically within 5–30 s. Thus, the major portion of the RIM machine is a high-
pressure pump and a metering system. Again, with highly intense shear, only short
ﬁbers and ﬁllers can be used as reinforcements. However, RIM uses low-viscosity
chemicals and this allows the preplacement of continuous ﬁber-woven fabrics in the
mold in a manner similar to RTM. The distinction between these two methods lies
in the preparation of the resin precursor. When the resin formulation is already
made, the method is called RTM, while if the resin is prepared in situ by an
impingement or static mixer, the method is termed as RIM.
6.5.10 Extrusion
In a thermoplastic process, pellets, granules, or powder are melted and forced
through a die under pressure to form a given continuous shape. Typical shapes
extruded are ﬂat ﬁlms and sheets, ﬁlaments and ﬁbers, strands for pelletizing, and
webs for coating and laminating. The technique is also used for forming composite-
preformed materials from mixtures of a matrix powder and short ﬁbers and is
suitable for metal–matrix composites. The method is widely used for continuous
production of ﬁlms, sheets, tubes, and other proﬁles and is also used in conjunction
with blow molding. A thermoplastic or thermoset molding compound is fed from a
hopper to a screw and barrel in which the molding compound is heated to plasticity
and then forwarded usually via a rotating screw, through a nozzle possessing the

desired cross section. Production lines require input and takeoff equipment that can
be complex.
The advantages include low tool cost, the possibility of numerous complex
proﬁle shapes, very rapid production rates, the possibility of applying coatings, or
jacketing to core materials (such as wires). Familiar products manufactured by
extrusion include pipes, ingots, guttering, window sills, and insulation on wires.
6.6 Understanding Manufacturing Process of Composites
6.6.1 Focusing on the Most Common
As mentioned above, the most common applications of composite are in automo-
tive, marine, industry, and recreational markets. The volume needs of the auto-
motive industry for OEM production product generally leads to the need for SMC
process, yet for low-volume niche vehicle applications. Often, the volume is too
low to justify the expenses of steel tooling needed for SMC. Hence, the total overall
volume in automotive industries excluding the SMC process is the focus of interest
here.
6.6.1.1 Raw Materials
In comparison, each of the focused processes and applications have commonalities
in terms of the materials used for composite molding. Each process typically uses a
polyester or vinyl ester resin, most often ﬁberglass reinforcement, with a ﬁber
loading of 25–30 wt% of the total laminate in comparison with the resin. The resin-
to-ﬁber ratio is most interesting and determines the strength and performance of the
ﬁnal molding.
It is to be understood that the corrosion, heat distortion temperature, and general
surface ﬁnish are driven primarily by the selection of the resin, while the
mechanical strength is mostly attributed to the ﬁber reinforcement. It is also to be
noted that the ﬁber length is a factor that determines the strength and short ﬁbers,
typically less than 1″ in length, impart poor strength, in comparison with the same
ﬁbers of lengths ranging from 1″ to 3″. The ﬁber distribution in the cross section of
the molded laminate is another critical factor determining the strength and perfor-
mance. If the ﬁber is heavily loaded to one side of the laminate, the remaining
laminate thickness will be made up of just the resin, which is bound to be unre-
inforced and prone to cracking if ﬂexed. It is to be noted that a ﬁber loading of
30 wt% equates to only approximately 17 vol%, and hence, it is technically for
more than 80 % of the laminate cross-sectional thickness to be attributed to only the
resin, which results in a laminate, which is weak when ﬂexed.

6.6.1.2 Comparison of Process Methods
It can be understood that the most common applications using composites have the
same basic resins and reinforcements in common. Hence, in effect, there is no real
difference between the materials used in a part molded by open mold or contact
molding and the materials used in a part made by RTM, LRTM, or VARTM/
vacuum infusion molding. However, the resin and the ﬁber are the same for each
process, and if the ﬁber-to-resin ratio in the laminate was the same when the cross-
sectional ﬁber distribution is consistent, then each of the process methods would
yield a molded part with the same performance in the end. Bearing the commonality
of the materials in mind, it is essential to understand the differences in the parts
molded using each of the different process methods.
Again, the open mold processes, as well as the RTM and LRTM processes, have
the same ﬁber loading ratio, i.e., typically 30 wt% of ﬁber and 70 wt% of resin. The
variant to the process methods is the VARTM or vacuum infusion process. In these
methods, the ﬁber loading increases to typically 60 wt% and to as high as 70 wt%
of the laminate, with the remaining 40–30 wt% attributed to the resin. Hence, if in
the case of the VARTM/vacuum infusion process, the much higher ﬁber volume
and the mechanical strength primarily originate from the reinforcement, it is then
logical to expect the performance of the parts obtained by VARTM/vacuum infu-
sion to be different and indeed, and marked differences have been observed. Yet,
before the differences are considered, it is key to review the differences in the
tooling used in VARTM in comparison with RTM or LRTM.
6.6.1.3 Comparison of Actual Mold Cavity of Each Process
In the open molding process, there is only one mold surface, and hence, the actual
part thickness is totally under the control of the operator. The part thickness is in
fact determined by how much resin and ﬁber is applied to the surface of the mold.
The operator can also control the ﬁber-to-resin ratio by manually adjusting the resin
content in relation to the ﬁber. RTM and LRTM both possess ﬁxed cavity cross
sections, which is inherent to the build of their match mold set. Hence, the glass-to-
resin ratios are the controlled by the type/amount of the ﬁber loaded and the
distribution of the ﬁber in the laminate cross section. In the VARTM process, there
is one rigid mold surface and the opposing mold half is a ﬁlm on top of the ﬁber.
The actual cavity is determined by the ﬁber thickness once the outer atmosphere
compresses the ﬁber when a vacuum is created between the rigid mold surface and
the ﬁlm over the ﬁber.
6.6.1.4 Required Strengths
Bearing in mind that over the years, the vast majority of molded parts have adopted
a typical ﬁber loading of 30 wt% deemed as sufﬁcient for most applications,
6.6
Understanding Manufacturing Process of Composites
229

variations of resins have then enhanced the ﬁber properties for speciﬁc needs of
heat or corrosion and surface ﬁnish. The other factor that is common to most
applications is the need for stiffness or ﬂexure modulus. Because in the VARTM
process, there is only one mold surface and the amount of ﬁber loaded upon the
surface sets the part thickness, using the same ﬁber loading value per square area in
the VARTM process as that used in other molding processes, yields a much thinner,
and thus, a more ﬂexible laminate.
6.6.2 Distinguishing the Differences
The SMC process produces the highest productivity with the highest surface ﬁnish
quality. The expected tooling life for a steel tool as that used in the SMC process is
greater than 100,000 moldings.
Open molding offers the lowest cost tooling and an exterior ﬁnish directly from
the mold, which meets the needs of a high-gloss smooth surface, which is normally
well suited for most marine and general nonautomotive surface needs. The lower-
quality surface achieved in comparison with that achieved in SMC can be attributed
to the mold materials (composites versus steel in SMC). Those in the automotive
industry, as well as others who need to meet a “Class A” exterior surface ﬁnish in
the absence of the volume to justify the use of the SMC process, can use the open
molding process, provided the surface of the molding is sanded, primed, and ﬁnish
painted to meet the ﬁnish speciﬁcations of the product needs. Additionally, in the
open mold process with only a single mold half, the back side of the molding is
fully dependent on the skill of the operator to maintain the part thickness and ﬁnish
smoothness. This requires many industries to grind the individual parts by hand to
ﬁt because of the variance, which is common to the manufacturing process.
RTM can enjoy the beneﬁts of steel tooling to achieve the true “Class A” surface
ﬁnish standards; however, the economics would be more viable if the mold is
placed in a press to form SMC so that the RTM process is typically performed using
composite tooling construction materials, such as the open molding process. The
advantage of having two mold halves eliminates the variance in part thickness,
which is common in the open mold method, making the RTM part very comparable
in dimensional accuracy and repeatability to that obtained by the SMC process.
6.6.3 Why Is Thickness an Issue?
The thickness sets the stiffness when all other factors are identical. For instance, in
an “I” beam, the top and bottom rails are separated by a web. The wider the web,
the greater is the load the “I” beam can withstand without deﬂecting. The same
holds true in a laminate; that is, the thicker the laminate is with an equal area
volume of ﬁber, the stiffer will be the laminate. This has been the major stumbling
230
6

block for the VARTM process from the beginning. By reducing the resin content,
the laminate becomes thinner when compared to those obtained in an open mold or
in the ﬁxed cavity of the RTM and LRTM processes. This thinner laminate then is
far lower in ﬂex modulus or much easier to bend. This issue makes the use of
VARTM in the marine market difﬁcult because the ﬁber is the most costly com-
ponent of the resin and glass makeup from a volume standpoint, in addition to being
the greatest contributor to the ﬁnal laminate weight. In order to regain the stiffness
achieved in the VARTM process, the laminate needs to be “bulked up” with either
more ﬁber or by adding some form of “core” each add cost.
6.6.4 Process Evolution
During the late 1960s through to the early 1970s, the composite industry experi-
enced signiﬁcant growth, which was driven by the marine industry (as the boats
converted fully from previously used wood materials) and the automotive industry
(to meet both styling needs and weight reduction of the various exterior body panel
components).
To meet the rapid market growth, the suppliers of the primary polymer resins and
ﬁber reinforcements developed their products to support SMC as required by the
automotive industry and the open molding process as required by the marine
manufactures. It should be noted that generally, the resins and reinforcement for both
SMC, open molding, and RTM are nearly identical. Hence, the primary differences
lie in the actual molding process methods and not in the materials involved.
6.6.4.1 Orphan Alternative Method: RTM
Throughout the evolution of the open mold and SMC processes, the closed molding
process has existed as an alternative. Like the SMC process that uses a matched set
of tooling (an upper and lower mold half), the RTM process has been available for
use in both the automotive and marine markets.
The RTM process was not accepted by the automotive markets because of their
demands of rapid or high-volume production. Also, the marine market also did not
accept RTM because of the added cost in tooling because two mold halves are needed,
while in the open molding process, only a cavity or single half-mold is needed.
6.7 Summary
The use of composites in space and aerospace applications continues to grow.
However, the vast majority of composite molding is used in automotive, marine,
industrial, and recreational applications. In the automotive industry, the typical
6.6
Understanding Manufacturing Process of Composites
231

composite molding is supplied through the use of SMC and the group of remaining
applications listed all rely on the open molding (spray-up or hand layup) process
often referred to as contact molding.
The trend toward the increased use of closed molding such as VARTM or RTM
(with its most recent innovations such as LRTM) has been inﬂuenced in recent
years by both an interest in the reduction of VOC emission and to lower the labor
content in the production processes, which currently rely on the open molding
technology.
At the time of writing this chapter, while there is a strong interest toward the use
of low-pressure closed molding methods to avoid excessive VOC emissions and to
reduce the need for skilled workers, the majority or the highest volume of parts
produced still rely on the open molding methods. However, the future clearly lies
with the closed molding processes, although the lack of practical experience on the
part of the molders and the added cost of tooling and raw materials used in pro-
ducing the closed molded parts have continued to slow the conversion from open
molding to closed molding over the years.

Abstract In recent decades, the carbon ﬁbers have found wide applications in
commercial and civilian aircraft, recreational, industrial, and transportation markets.
This chapter will be focused on the applications of virgin carbon ﬁbers and carbon
ﬁber-reinforced composites including adsorbents, molecular sieves, electrodes,
catalyst, and biomedical applications. In addition, for various applications, the
applications of the carbon ﬁber-reinforced composites applied in various industries
will be covered. Finally, we will discuss the carbon/carbon composites, which have
attracted considerable attention in the aerospace and braking systems with excellent
thermal properties.
7.1 Introduction
Carbon ﬁbers are a new breed of high-strength materials. Carbon ﬁbers contain at
least 90 % carbon through the controlled pyrolysis of appropriate ﬁbers [1]. The
carbon ﬁber came into being in 1879 when Edison took out a patent for the
manufacturing process of carbon ﬁlaments for use in electric lamps [2]. However, it
was only in the early 1960s when the successful commercial production was
started, as the requirements of the aerospace industry, especially for military air-
craft, for better and lightweight materials became of paramount signiﬁcance [3–5].
In recent decades, the carbon ﬁbers have found wide applications in commercial
and civilian aircraft, recreational, industrial, and transportation markets. Carbon
ﬁbers are used in composites with a lightweight matrix. Carbon ﬁber composites are
ideally suited to applications in which strength, stiffness, low weight, and out-
standing fatigue characteristics are critical requirements [6]. They also can be used
for applications in which high temperature, chemical inertness, and high damping
are important. The suppliers of Advanced Composites Materials Association

released the 1997 industry statistics on the worldwide shipments of carbon ﬁbers for
composites [7]. However, from 1997 to 1999, there was a global slowing in the
demand for carbon ﬁbers. According to Mitsubishi Rayon Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan),
a carbon ﬁber producer, the worldwide consumption for sporting goods is nearly 11
million lb of carbon ﬁbers [8].
As the political situation in the world has changed, the requirement for carbon
ﬁbers in military applications has decreased owing to major defense cuts. The
emphasis has shifted to commercial applications, which have grown extensively.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the carbon ﬁbers are involved in a whole gamut
of new applications. Developments do occur very rapidly in the area of composites,
and although some of these applications may now have been discontinued or
replaced, they serve to illustrate the diverse applications of carbon ﬁbers [9, 10].
This chapter is focused on the applications of virgin carbon ﬁbers and carbon
ﬁber-reinforced composites. First, virgin carbon ﬁbers are widely used as adsor-
bents [11], molecular sieves [12], electrodes [13], catalysts [14], and in biomedical
applications [15]. For various applications, carbon ﬁbers are generally used as the
activated forms through either chemical or physical activation process because of
their high speciﬁc surface area and superior electrical properties with strong
physicochemical properties [16–19]. In this section, we concentrate on the appli-
cations of carbon ﬁbers in adsorbents and electrodes. Second, carbon ﬁber-rein-
forced composites were recently applied to aircraft, vehicle, sporting goods, and
construction. The carbon ﬁber-reinforced composites can reduce the weight by over
30 % while retaining high strength. In this section, we will review the applications
of the carbon ﬁber-reinforced composites applied in various industries. Also, we
will discuss the carbon/carbon composites, which have attracted considerable
attention in the aerospace and braking systems with excellent thermal properties.
7.2 Applications of Virgin Carbon Fibers
In general, activated carbons are made by the carbonization of a product such as
coconut shells and polymer precursors via the controlled heat treatment and either
chemical or physical activation. First, carbon precursors are carbonized up to
approximately 800–1,000 °C in N2 atmosphere. Second, carbonized samples are
activated by chemical method using either activation agents such as KOH and ZnCl
or physical methods such as steam or CO2 [20–30]. The activation process leads to
the formation of the meso- and micropores and can yield a high pore volume of
approximately 0.5 cm3/g.
In 1976, Toho Beslon [31] developed the method for preparing activated ﬁbers
from PAN using an Fe salt in air or O2 at lower temperatures (150–300 °C) for
preoxidation. The oxidized ﬁber was then either activated using a chemical reagent
or by physical activation at 700–1,000 °C. The product has a high speciﬁc surface
area of approximately 300–2,000 m2/g [32, 33].

Recent Uses of Carbon Fibers

Later, various studies were carried out on the preparation of activated carbon
ﬁbers (ACFs) based on PAN, ciscoes rayon, phenolic resin ﬁber (Kynol), pitch
ﬁber, and hybrid resin, i.e., PAN and phenolic ﬁbers [34, 35]. The typical properties
of ACC are listed in Table 7.1.
In general, the ACC could be used as adsorbents for many organic molecules,
including organic vapors and impurities, i.e., phosphates and nitrates, and bacteria and
viruses, and in defense applications such as face masks, respirators, and ﬁlters in
closed air-conditioning systems, protective clothing, and combat gear [36]. In addi-
tion, they are used in industrial applications such as air conditioning, odor control,
solvent recovery, liquid puriﬁcation, enzyme and catalyst support, and medical
applications such as bandages, face masks, and blood puriﬁcation. In this section, we
focus on the adsorbents such as hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and organic molecules.
ACFs have unique characteristics compared to those of either granular or
powder-activated carbons [37–41]. Thin-ﬁber shape clearly assures fast intraparticle
adsorption kinetics compared to that of either pelletized or granular-activated car-
bons commonly employed in gas- and aqueous-phase adsorptions [42]. This
becomes more important in designing adsorption units in which intraparticle dif-
fusion resistance is the most signiﬁcant factor, resulting in a considerable decrease
in the size of adsorption units. The ﬁbrous form is also favored because of ease in
handling when it is used in felt or fabric forms and availability in the consolidated
forms by newly developed molding techniques. Because ACFs are considered to
have rather deﬁned pore structures and surface characteristics, fundamental studies
on adsorption have been tried from various angles.
7.2.1 Activated Carbon Fibers as Adsorbents
The development of the efﬁcient hydrogen storage technology is important for the
use hydrogen as future fuel. For application in the industry, the amount of hydrogen
storage of 6.5 wt.% at desirable conditions is required by DOE (US). Recently,
well-known storage systems are compression, liquefaction, or storage as metal

hydrides. Nowadays, the use of solid sorbents has been studied as a potential
alternative method to store the cryogenic liquids and compressed gases [43–49].
Among various hydrogen storage systems, the metal-hydride-based hydrogen
storage systems can provide excellent safety with higher volumetric density com-
pared to that afforded by conventional methods. However, this method requires a
heavy reservoir to store hydrogen in metal hydrides. Thus, this method is limited to
mobile applications.
Hydrogen physisorption is considered as one of the most promising storage
technologies to meet the DOE goals. In contrast to the chemisorptions in metal
hydrides, the phenomenon of physical adsorption of the undissociated hydrogen
molecules on the surface of microporous carbon ﬁbers or particles could improve the
situation. This possibility to reach high sorption capacity is because of the ability of
carbon to exist in either a ﬁnely powdered or ﬁbrous form with highly porous struc-
ture, and the speciﬁc interactions between the carbon atoms and gas molecules. The
total amount of stored hydrogen strongly depends on the pore geometry and pore size
distribution as well as the storage pressure and temperature. The sorption of hydrogen
usually takes place in the micropores. Macropores have no practical inﬂuence on the
sorption capacity because they are only important for the gas compression and
sorption/desorption reaction rate. Owing to its low density, high surface area and
micropore volume, low cost, and accessibility at the industrial level, activated carbons
are considered as good candidates for hydrogen storage systems [50].
Previously, Kunowsky et al. [51] reported the effect of the carbonization tem-
perature on the activation of hydrogen storage of carbon ﬁbers. They prepared two
carbon ﬁbers carbonized at 973 and 1,273 K, and then, the carbon ﬁbers were
activated with KOH and NaOH to obtain the optimized pore structures for hydrogen
storage.
We found that the highly microporous ACFs were obtained at the lower car-
bonization temperature and KOH was more effective in developing the micropore
structure as an activation agent, as shown in Fig. 7.1.

H2 adsorption was measured at 298 K up to 20 MPa, and at 77 K up to 4 MPa.
The maximum adsorption of hydrogen was 1 wt.% at room temperature and 3.8 wt.
% at 77 K, respectively. The total volumetric storage capacity was 17 g/L at 298 K
and 32 g/L at 77 K. Thus, the prepared ACFs showed good hydrogen storage with a
well-developed porous structure. Economically, the prepared carbon ﬁbers had the
following advantages: (1) low carbonization temperature; (2) low activation agent
content with KOH for developing a porous structure; and (3) high carbon yield after
carbonization and activation (Fig. 7.2).
Park et al. [52] studied the effect of copper electroplating on high-pressure
hydrogen storage of ACFs. In this work, the copper nanoparticles were plated onto
the surfaces of ACFs in order to improve the hydrogen storage capacity at 100 atm
and 298 K.
The pore structures of Cu/ACFs and total pore volumes were analyzed with
reference to N2 = 77 K adsorption isotherms, and surface morphologies were
characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively, as shown in
Fig. 7.3. In Fig. 7.3 (left), Cu-10 was partially covered with Cu particles and Cu-30
was fully covered. The sizes of the observed copper particles was over the range
200–300 nm, indicating that some ACF pores could be blocked in the presence of
Cu particles, speciﬁcally affecting the decreased surface area. As mentioned, the
speciﬁc surface area and total pore volume decreased with increasing electroplating
time (see Fig. 7.3 on the right).
However, the hydrogen storage capacity was enhanced in the presence of Cu
nanoparticles for Cu-10 and Cu-30 samples, and then began to decline. These
results indicated that the surface properties were weakened owing to the Cu
nanoparticles but that the hydrogen storage capacity increased by the modiﬁed
spillover of hydrogen molecules into the carbon structures (Fig. 7.4).
Air we breathe is polluted with contaminants such as toxic gases, dust, and some
volatile organic solvents. It is well known that acidic gases such as HCl, SOx, and
NOx are major air pollutants. HCl gas poses the highest risk when exposed to

human body, and it can threaten human life even when present in very small
amounts in air.
ACFs are widely used in applications such as air and water puriﬁcation and
solvent recovery. It is recognized that the pore structure and surface functional
groups are the most important properties of ACFs, which make them suitable for
applications such as adsorption processes. Park et al. studied the effect of oxygen

plasma treatment on the removal of hydrogen chloride from the ACFs. In this work,
the oxygen plasma treatment of the ACFs was carried out to introduce oxygen-
containing groups onto the carbon surfaces. The surface properties of the ACFs
were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Table 7.2), while
the SEM images before and after plasma treatment are displayed in Fig. 7.5.

The surface atomic compositions obtained using XPS analysis are presented in
Table 7.2. It can be seen that the surface of the ACFs is mainly composed of
carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. The carbon and oxygen contents of the as-received
sample are 90.4 and 7.8 %, respectively; however, those of P-O-4 are 80.7 and
17.2 %. The O1S/C1S ratio of plasma-treated ACFs increased with the treatment
time owing to the conformation of oxygen-containing surface functional groups on
the carbon surfaces.
To study the changes of the surface morphologies of the as-received and P-O-4,
SEM images were used at a resolution of ×50,000, as shown in Fig. 7.5. We found
that many macropores appeared after the oxygen plasma treatments by the
destruction of the carbon surfaces, and it could lead to a decrease in the speciﬁc
surface area and total pore volume.
N2/77 K adsorption isotherms were investigated using BET and D–R plot
methods to characterize the speciﬁc surface area, pore volume, and pore size dis-
tribution. The efﬁciency of hydrochloride removal was conﬁrmed using two types
of methods: detecting tubes (range: 1–40 ppm) and gas chromatography. As
experimentally found, the hydrochloride-removal efﬁciency of the ACFs increased
with the number of plasma treatment times up to approximately 300 %, resulting
from the newly formed oxygen-containing functional groups (especially, phenolic
and carboxylic) on carbon surfaces, in the decreased speciﬁc surface areas or pore
volumes. These results indicated that the plasma treatment led to an increase in the
hydrochloride removal owing to the improvement of the surface functional groups
containing oxygen on the carbon surfaces.
Setoyama et al. [53] tried to determine the micropore distributions of ACFs
using a helium adsorption technique and compared the distributions with those
determined using the conventional nitrogen adsorption method for three types of
ACFs. They excluded the effect of wider pores and assumed the Gaussian distri-
bution for micropore size, and determined the parameters shown in Table 7.3. The

portion of wider pores was rather small, and helium was able to better detect the
existence of smaller pores compared to nitrogen in ACFs.
Mochida et al. [54, 55] found that the sulfuric acid-treated PAN-based ACF had
a high catalytic effect on the reduction of NO by ammonia. The active sites were
estimated to be oxygen-containing functional groups on ACF surfaces. They also
prepared copper acetate supported on ACF and found that PAN–ACF showed good
dispersion ability as a support of copper acetate.
Kim et al. [56] studied the adsorption behavior of propylamine on ACFs induced
by oxygen functional complexes. The rayon-based ACFs (KF-1,500, approximately
1,420 m2/g of speciﬁc surface area) were used as the initial materials, and the ACFs
were subjected to acid treatment in 1.0 M of HNO3 solution for 1 h at 373 K. The
ACFs before and after the acid treatment were named virgin ACFs (V-ACFs) and
acidic ACFs (A-ACFs), respectively, which, after PA adsorption, were renamed
PA-V-ACFs and PA-A-ACFs.
To facilitate detailed understanding, the O1S peaks before and after the treat-
ments were deconvoluted into surface oxygen complex contributions, as shown in
Fig. 7.6, and the speciﬁc ratios of the contributions were also provided. The O1S
peaks of the ACFs showed four line shapes with binding energies of 530.9, 532.4,
533.8, and 535.2 eV assigned to C=O, C–O, O–C=O, and chemisorbed O2 (or
H2O), respectively. It was found that the ratios of C=O and O–C=O increased,
whereas that of C–O decreased. This result indicated that severe oxidation led to a
decrease in the ratio of C–O, resulting in an increase in those of C=O and O–C=O.
Figure 7.7 illustrates the adsorption isotherms of PA on the V-ACFs at 298 K. It
was found that the amount of adsorbed PA rapidly increased as a result of the
micropore ﬁlling effects under 0.1 relative pressure, and then reached a plateau at
1.0 of relative pressure, as representative of a typical Type I isotherm. The PA
adsorption curve for the A-ACFs showed a pattern similar to that of the V-ACFs;
however, the total PA adsorption amount was larger than that of the V-ACFs. It was
noteworthy that the amount of PA adsorbed on the A-ACFs increased, whereas the

speciﬁc surface area decreased, after the acid treatment. This result clearly showed
that the PA adsorption was largely affected not only by the textual properties of
adsorbents but also surface oxygen complexes (or functionalities) (Fig. 7.8).
7.2.2 Carbon Fibers for Energy Storage
1. Fuel cells
A fuel cell is a device that converts the chemical energy from a fuel into electricity
through a chemical reaction with oxygen or another oxidizing agent [57]. Hydrogen
is the most common fuel but hydrocarbons such as natural gas and alcohols,
including methanol, are sometimes used. Fuel cells are different from batteries in

that they require a constant source of fuel and oxygen to run, but they can produce
electricity continually for as long as these inputs are supplied [58]. William Grove, a
Welsh physicist, developed the ﬁrst crude fuel cells in 1839 [59]. The ﬁrst com-
mercial use of fuel cells was in NASA space programs to generate power for probes,
satellites, and space capsules. Since then, fuel cells have been used in many other
applications. Fuel cells are used for primary and backup power for commercial,
industrial, and residential buildings and in remote or inaccessible areas. They are
also used to power fuel cell vehicles, including automobiles, buses, forklifts, air-
planes, boats, motorcycles, and submarines [60–62].
There are many types of fuel cells but they all consist of an anode (negative
side), a cathode (positive side), and an electrolyte, which allows charges to move
between the two sides of the fuel cell. Electrons are drawn from the anode to the
cathode through an external circuit, producing direct current. As the main difference
among fuel cell types is the electrolyte, fuel cells are classiﬁed by the type of
electrolyte involved. Fuel cells come in a variety of sizes. Individual fuel cells
produce small amounts of electricity, approximately 0.7 V; therefore, cells are
“stacked,” or placed in series or parallel circuits, to increase the voltage and current
output to meet the power generation requirements of applications [63]. In addition
to electricity, fuel cells produce water, heat and, depending on the fuel source, small
amounts of nitrogen dioxide, and other emissions. The energy efﬁciency of a fuel
cell is generally between 40 and 60 %, or up to 85 % if the waste heat is captured
for use.
Nowadays, many researchers have attempted to improve the efﬁciency of fuel
cells. In this regard, carbon ﬁbers have been widely used as electrode materials,
electrical reinforcements in bipolar plates, substrates for metallic catalysts, and so
on. In this section, we review certain applications of the carbon ﬁbers for fuel cells.
With the development of electric vehicles, studies on fuel cell and its component
materials have been the main focus for researchers all over the world [64]. Materials
used as fuel cell electrodes should be light, highly conductive, porous, inert, and
stable. In proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), carbon ﬁber paper (CFP)
and carbon cloth are now used effectively as electrode substrates to support the
catalyst, conduct current, and allow gases to pass through. The properties of the
substrate have an important effect on the performance of the fuel cells [65, 66].
CFP, made of carbon ﬁber through wet paper-making method [67], has better
processing properties than that made of pulp and carbon black or graphite powder.
However, it is difﬁcult to disperse the carbon ﬁber evenly in the pulp, and the
resistance of the resultant CFP is high. To reduce the resistance, the paper needs to
be treated at high temperatures. Zhang and Shen [68] studied the effect of heat
treatment temperature on the mechanical and electrical properties of CFP. CFP was
prepared using pitch-based carbon felt through impregnation with resin, molding,
and heat treatment at different temperatures.
Table 7.4 showed that both speciﬁc resistance and tensile strength of CFP greatly
decreased with the increasing heat treatment temperatures. However, at tempera-
tures higher than 2,273 K, the change decreased. The change of resistance indicated
that the removal of noncarbon atoms and rearrangement of carbon network was
7.2

almost complete up to 2,273 K. The smaller the speciﬁc resistance, the better the
electrical conductivity; this meant that electrical conductivity increased with
increasing temperature. However, the amount of resin carbon from resin decom-
position at higher temperature decreased; therefore, adhesion between the CFP
became weak, leading to lower tensile strength. The SEM images indicated that the
carbon ﬁbers were arranged randomly in the paper, which contributed similar
conductivity in every direction to the paper [68]. There were many pores between
the carbon ﬁbers, which made CFP porous. The sections between the carbon ﬁbers
were weaker than the carbon ﬁbers, so they were the key drawbacks of CFP. By
keeping the resistance of CFP acceptable, forming adequate resin carbon in between
the carbon ﬁbers could improve the tensile properties of CFP. Molding is the key
step to determine the thickness of the CFP. The density, speciﬁc resistance, and
tensile strength of CFP decreased with increasing heat treatment temperature while
the electrical conductivity increased. The SEM images indicated that the carbon
ﬁbers coated with carbon ﬁlms were arranged randomly in the paper. CFP with
thickness of 0.3 mm, bulk density of 0.4–0.5 g/cm3, and speciﬁc resistance of
200–300 mV m was produced after heat treatment above 2,273 K.
Proton electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are able to efﬁciently generate
high power densities, making the technology potentially attractive for certain
mobile and portable applications. Because the bipolar plate is a major part of the
PEMFC stack both in weight and volume, the bipolar plate should be developed
with its weight and thickness in mind.
Hwang et al. [69] reported the carbon ﬁber-reinforced epoxy composite-based
bipolar plate for PEMFCs. In this study, a bipolar plate for automotive fuel cells
was developed using carbon ﬁber composites by compression molding owing to the
fact that carbon/epoxy composites showed not only high electrical and thermal
conductivities, but also high speciﬁc stiffness and strength. The mechanical and
thermoelectrical properties of the developed composite bipolar plate were measured
to investigate its suitability for the automotive fuel cells. The ﬂexural strengths of
the previous composite bipolar plates were primarily signiﬁcantly lower than the
target value of approximately 59 MPa. However, the composite bipolar plate
without the corrugated ﬂow channels had a ﬂexural strength of 316 MPa at both
room temperature and operating temperature, and the composite bipolar plate with
corrugated ﬂow channels had a ﬂexural strength of 195 MPa at room temperature
and 180 MPa at operating temperature. In addition, the in-plane electrical

conductivity of the cross-ply composite used for this work was 300 S/cm, which
was much higher than the DOE target of 100 S cm−1. This was because the pitch-
based continuous carbon ﬁbers showed high electrical conductivity.
The area speciﬁc resistance is an important property of the fuel cell stack
because the energy loss in the fuel cell is proportional to the value of ASR. The
values of ASR for the composite bipolar plate were 42 and 58 mΩ cm2 when the
compaction pressures were 1.0 and 0.5 MPa, respectively. Both the high carbon
ﬁber volume fraction and strong bond between the carbon ﬁber and epoxy resin
induced low gas permeability in the composite. The measured permeability was
approximately 1.4 × 10−8 m3 m−2 s−1, which was smaller than 2 × 10−8 m3 m−2 s−1
for the bipolar plate application.
Kim et al. [70] have studied the effect of nickel coating on improving the
electrical conductivity of carbon ﬁbers for applying such a coating on the electrode
or bipolar plate of the fuel cell. In this work, nickel/carbon hybrid ﬁbers were
prepared by the electrolytic plating on carbon ﬁbers in order to improve the elec-
trical conductivity of the carbon ﬁbers; the effects of nickel content and coating
thickness on the electrical conductivity of the ﬁbers were studied. As for the
experimental results, it was observed that the electrical conductivity of the nickel/
carbon hybrid ﬁbers was dramatically increased in the presence of metallic nickel
particles, with the best result observed with a thickness of over 0.75 μm owing to
the minimization of the inner pores, as shown in Table 7.5.
Table 7.5 lists the average coating thickness of nickel/carbon hybrid ﬁbers as a
function of plating time from 5 to 60 s. The measurement of layer thickness was
possible after 10 s of plating time. The thickness increased linearly up to 30 s of
plating time and then increased rapidly. In the interval of 10–30 s, the average
plating speed was 0.025 μm/s, and then increased to 0.03 μm/s after 60 s of plating
time.
To conﬁrm the effects of nickel layer thickness on the electrical resistance of the
nickel/carbon hybrid ﬁbers, the four-point probe method was employed; the results
are shown in Fig. 7.9. It was found that the speciﬁc resistance decreased with
increasing plating time. Also, it was observed that the speciﬁc resistivity of the as-
received sample was over 0.80 × 10−3 Ω cm but that this value decreased dra-
matically with increasing plating time up to 60 s. From the good linearity of results
over the range 5–30 s, it was found that there was a strong correlation between the
electrical conductivity and plating time. In the case of electric conductivity after
60 s of plating time, the conductivity was not signiﬁcantly enhanced. This meant

that a perfect Ni layer could be formed over the range 30–60 s of plating time,
resulting in a saturation state of electrical conductivity owing to the minimization of
inner pores (or contact loss between nickel particles).
2. Supercapacitor
Recently, EDLCs have shown new and promising applications in the capacitive
deionization of water and as pulse power sources for digital communication devices
and electric vehicles. The popularity of these devices arises from their higher
energy density relative to the conventional capacitors as well as their longer cycle
life and higher power density relative to batteries [71–75].
In recent years, activated carbon materials, including activated carbons, glassy
carbons, carbon nanotubes, carbon aerogels, and carbon ﬁbers, have attracted
considerable attention as electrode materials for supercapacitors because of their
high speciﬁc surface areas of up to 500–3,000 m2/g and excellent microstructures
and electrochemical properties with low costs. In particular, using ﬁbrous materials
yields an additional proﬁt from the construction point of view and thus offers a
number of advantages over conventional powdered activated carbons [76–79].
Babel and Jurewicz [80] reported the electrochemical performance of the ACF-
based electrode for supercapacitors. Carbon fabrics from viscose ﬁbers activated
with KOH have been investigated as possible electrode materials for electro-
chemical capacitors. The ﬁbers were ﬁrst pyrolyzed at 400 or 600 °C, then saturated
with KOH at C/KOH ratios from 1:3.5 to 1:5 and treated over the temperature range
700–800 °C. The carbon ﬁbers saturated with KOH were analyzed using thermo-
gravimetric and differential thermal analysis in order to obtain information on the
temperature dependence of the KOH reaction with carbon. The textural properties
of each sample are shown in Table 7.6. The porous features of ACFs were
dependent on the KOH activation conditions. A distinct hysteresis of the curves
conﬁrmed that the ﬁbers contained considerable volumes of mesopores. The mi-
cropores/mesopores ratio slightly exceeded 1, with a high micropore volume of

above 0.85 cm3, which revealed deeply activated carbons. A speciﬁc surface area
close to 2,000 m2/g was mainly the result of microporosity.
The electrochemical properties of the activated carbons were determined using
three-electrode Swagelokw-type capacitors both in 4-M H2SO4 and 7-M KOH
aqueous electrolytes. Speciﬁc capacities of 340 and 270 F/g were determined in
acidic and alkaline media, respectively. The electrical capacity for both negative
and positive electrodes depended on the treatment method. The capacitance values
were discussed taking into account the porous texture, elemental composition, and
surface functionality of the ACFs.
Leitner et al. [81] have studied the Nomex-derived ACFs as electrode materials
in carbon-based supercapacitors. The SEM micrograph of sample NP1-90 showed
that the diameter of the ﬁbers was in the order of 10 μm. The ﬁbers showed a
bilobular section, which was more easily appreciated over the high-resolution
image of a single ﬁber [81]. The bilobular morphology was already present in the
parent Nomex polymer, and maintained along with pyrolysis and activation treat-
ments. Depending on the burn-off owing to the activation, the BET surface area of
the carbons was in the order of 1,300–2,800 m2/g, thereby providing an extensive
network of micropores. The electrochemical characterization was carried out for the
electrodes prepared using several ACF samples in an aqueous solution. Their
capability as active materials for supercapacitors was evaluated using cyclic vol-
tammetry and impedance spectroscopy. NP1-90 showed the highest capacitance
value (175 F/g) in sulfuric acid, indicating that the NP1-90 was the most suitable
sample for application in supercapacitors and exhibited excellent capacitive
behavior. Furthermore, it was observed that the speciﬁc capacitance and perfor-
mance of the electrode increased signiﬁcantly with the increasing burn-off degree.
This fact could be attributed to an increase in the surface area and porosity with
increasing burn-off. Contrary to all the other samples, N-42 ﬁbers showed a lesser
increase in capacitance at lower frequencies compared to those of the other samples
indicating again that the accessibility of the electrolyte to this carbon was minor. As
the burn-off increased, an increase in the capacitance was detectable. Also, an
increase in the capacitance shifted to the higher frequency domains, which con-
ﬁrmed that the electrolyte penetration into the pores of the electrode improved at
higher burn-off degrees.

3. Lithium battery
Carbonaceous materials have been adopted as the prospective alternate anode for
lithium metal in lithium rechargeable batteries [82–86]. Several types of carbon
materials show better electrode performance compared to the other intercalation
compounds such as transition metal oxides, lithium alloys, and lithium metal; they
have high speciﬁc capacity, low electrode potential, high coulombic efﬁciency, long
cycle life, and high level of safety because of lack of dendritic lithium metal during
charge–discharge cycles [87].
Industrialized mesophase pitch-based carbon ﬁbers have distinctive morphology
and several macroscopic transverse textures. Consequently, these materials have
attracted much interest and many researches have investigated their electrode
characteristics. The pitch-based carbon ﬁbers could also have unique “skin-core”
structures consisting of two different crystal structure regions in addition to the
morphology and transverse textures [88].
Suzuki et al. [89] used the pitch-based carbon ﬁber as an anode in lithium
rechargeable batteries. Two types of mesophase pitches, A and B, were used for
spinning. The physical properties and elemental analysis data of the mesophase
pitches used are listed in Table 7.7. The relation between the electrode character-
istics and structures or textures of pitch-based carbon ﬁbers controlled by spinning
or stabilization conditions was investigated. The graphitized ﬁber spun at a lower
viscosity had a higher degree of graphitization and higher discharge capacity. The
graphitized ﬁber spun at a higher viscosity exhibited a higher rate capability,
thereby suggesting that the lithium ions could diffuse more easily in a ﬁber com-
posed of smaller crystallites compared to the larger ones. The graphitized ﬁber
stabilized at a higher temperature, showed a lower irreversible capacity, which
might be owing to the relatively less developed graphite structure in the surface
region. The graphitized pitch-based carbon ﬁber prepared with optimum conditions
achieved a maximum discharge capacity of 315 mAh/g, an initial irreversible
capacity of 10 mAh/g and an initial coulombic efﬁciency of approximately 97 %.

The particle size of metallic tin in this composite was 20–40 nm and controlled by

posite cycled versus Li metal showed a ﬁrst discharge capacity as high as 200 mAh/
g compared to that of the pristine ACF, which showed only 87 mAh/g. Excellent
cyclability with these composites was obtained with ACF BET SSA as large as

2,000 m2/g and 30 wt.% Sn. After 20 cycles, the Sn-impregnated OG-7A prepared
via aqueous/nonaqueous route showed higher discharge capacities compared to
those showed by pristine OG-7A, despite the gradually decreasing capacity owing
to the degradation of tin particles especially prepared in a nonaqueous solution. The
nonaqueous preparation might provide a larger amount of tin particles, which
showed considerable capacity in the ﬁrst cycle and degraded its reversible capacity
during subsequent cycles, on the outer surface of ACF. Tin-impregnated ACF
negative electrode was expected to have good cycle capability when many tin
nanoparticles were trapped inside the ACF surface structure. Therefore, an ACF
with a larger surface area compared to OG-7A would be expected to have a larger
pore volume and bring a greater number of tin nanoparticles [90].
7.2.3 Molecular Sieves
Carbon molecular sieves (CMS) are widely used in gas separation processes
[91–96]. The unique property of CMS to separate gases based on the different sizes
and shapes of molecules has been exploited in commercial applications. The most
important feature of CMS is that they have narrow pore size distribution accom-
plished either by controlled activation or employment of pore narrowing techniques
in an inherent pore structure [91]. Freitas and Figueiredo [97] reported that the
modiﬁcation of two activated carbons of different textures by the pyrolysis of
benzene could yield the CMS for O2/N2 separation. The results showed that this
objective could be attained when the carbon precursor had been activated only to a
limited extent, and when the carbon deposition was carried out in the proper kinetic
regime. Vyas et al. [98] obtained the CMS by methane cracking on bituminous coal
and coconut shells, and subsequently, the O2/N2 uptake ratio of the best CMS
produced was 2.667. Cabrera et al. [99] described the preparation of CMS for air
separation using a two-step hydrocarbon deposition with a single hydrocarbon.
They found that the concentration of the carbon-containing compound used in the
ﬁrst step should be larger than that in the second step, so that the pore openings of
the micropores of the support narrowed gradually, avoiding pore plugging.
7.2.4 Catalysts
A porous carbon ﬁber also exhibits catalytic activities [100, 101]. For example, the
porous carbon ﬁbers might be used as a catalyst in the oxidation of SO2 and NO.
The catalytic activities are attributed to the surface functional groups such as
hydroxyl, carboxylic, and quinone, which are incorporated during the activation
stage. Depending upon the type of adsorbate (basic or acidic, anionic or cationic),
the surfaces of the porous carbon ﬁbers might also be accordingly functionalized.
The surface groups of porous carbon ﬁbers containing electronegative oxygen

atoms adversely affected the adsorption of VOCs. On the other hand, the adsorption
of SO2 and NO was found to be primarily controlled by the extent of the surface
oxygen functional groups. The results of the surface characterization analysis in
relation to those of breakthrough analysis showed that the extent of oxygen func-
tional groups on the surface of porous carbon ﬁbers was less, while the extent of
adsorption or oxidation of SO2 and NO was high [100].
7.3 Applications of Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Composites
The use of ﬁber-reinforced composites has become an increasingly attractive
alternative to the conventional metals for many aircraft components mainly owing
to their increased strength, durability, corrosion resistance, resistance to fatigue, and
damage tolerance characteristics. Fiber-reinforced composites also provide greater
ﬂexibility because the material can be tailored to meet the design requirements and
they also offer signiﬁcant weight advantages. At present, carefully designed indi-
vidual composite parts are approximately 20–30 % lighter than their conventional
metal counterparts. Although all-composite airplanes are now available in the world
market, advances in the practical use of composite materials should enable further
reduction in the structural weight of airplanes. The ﬁber-reinforced composites used
in the aircraft industry are generally either reinforced ﬁbers or ﬁlaments embedded
in a resin matrix. The most common ﬁbers are carbon and their hybrids. The resin
matrix is generally an epoxy-based system requiring curing temperatures between
250 and 350 °F [102–104].
Fiber-reinforced composites used for aircraft structural applications are generally
fabricated using sandwich construction having face sheets of either carbon ﬁbers or
carbon ﬁbers combined with aramid or glass ﬁbers with a honeycomb core [105].
For interior aircraft applications, composite parts are required to meet the requisite
mechanical properties and process abilities. In addition, materials used within the
pressurized portion of aircraft must have ﬂammability resistance. Interior parts such
as overhead bins, sidewall panels, ceilings, ﬂoor boards, galleys, partitions, and
cargo ﬂoor board liners are made of composite materials, which are generally ﬁber-
reinforced epoxy or phenolic resin. For interior applications, phenolic resin systems
are mainly used because of their excellent ﬁre-resistant properties, including low
ﬂammability and low smoke and low toxic gas emission [106].
7.3.1 Aircraft
The application of ﬁber-reinforced composites to aircraft can be traced back almost
three decades to the F-14 (US Navy) and F-15 (US Air Force) ﬁghters, which used
boron/epoxy skins in their empennages [107–110]. Later, the use of carbon ﬁber-
reinforced composites in military and transport aircraft increased resulting from
254
7
Recent Uses of Carbon Fibers

their high performance. The initial applications of carbon ﬁber-reinforced com-
posites to aircraft structures included secondary structures such as fairings, small
doors, and control surfaces. As the technology advanced, the use of carbon ﬁber-
reinforced composites for primary structures such as wings and fuselages increased
[107]. The applications of the current aircraft along with the general uses of
composite materials in each aircraft are shown in Table 7.8.
The aircraft industry chooses to use carbon ﬁber-reinforced composites not only
to reduce weight, but also because these materials are corrosion and fatigue resis-
tant. The limiting factor in the widespread applications of these materials has been
their high cost compared to that of the conventional metals.
1. Fighter aircraft
The trends in the use of ﬁber-reinforced composites for ﬁghter aircraft are shown in
Fig. 7.10. The percentage by weight of composite materials used initially (e.g., F-
15E) was small at 2 %, but this percentage has since grown to more than 25 % for
F-22, which is the designated replacement for the F-15E. The F-22 has demon-
strated the feasibility and beneﬁts of introducing processes such as resin transfer
molding (RTM) to improve the affordability of composite materials in ﬁghter air-
craft applications. The use of carbon ﬁber-reinforced composites in the US Navy’s
F/A-18E/F equals nearly 20 % of its structural weight in ﬂight critical parts, as
shown in Fig. 7.11. The choice of composite materials in the F/A-18E/F was
dictated by the need to reduce weight and improve strength, reliability, and
maintenance in an aircraft carrier environment. The center and aft fuselage skins
and other ancillary structures, such as speed brakes and dorsal covers, are all-
carbon/toughened-epoxy construction in the F/A-18E/F. Carbon ﬁbers such as
Hexcel’s IM7 with improved strength and stiffness properties are used in the wing
and tail skins. Although composite materials, in general, are sensitive to impact
damage, toughened materials such as Fiberite’s 977-3 toughened epoxy system

used in the F/A-18E/F have successfully addressed this threat in operations. The
AV-8B uses nearly 25 % by weight of composite materials in its airframe [111]
(Fig. 7.12).
2. Transport aircraft
Airbus industry used advanced composites in the Airbus A300 aircraft, which ﬁrst
ﬂew in 1972. The composite material was used in ﬁn leading edge and other glass
ﬁber fairing panels. In 1979, the in-service evaluation of the Airbus A300 aircraft
led to the further use of composite components in the Airbus A300, namely CFRP
spoilers and rudders, air brakes, and CFRP landing-gear doors. The use of com-
posites was extended to the Airbus A310 aircraft during 1980–1985, and thereafter,
to the Airbus A320 aircraft in 1987. In the Airbus A300B2/B4 aircraft, only glass
ﬁber structures have been used. AFRP and CFRP structures have been used in the
Airbus A310-200 aircraft. For the Airbus A320 and Airbus A330/340 aircraft,
GFRP, CFRP, and AFRP have been used for the composite structures. The use of
composites in the Airbus family of aircraft has consistently increased since the
making of the Airbus A300 aircraft. The composites account for approximately
15 % of the structure of the Airbus A320 aircraft. Although the total weight of the
composite structures is relatively much higher in the Airbus A330/A340 aircraft,
the percentage of weight in relation to the total weight of aircraft is nearly 12 %.
The use of composites on the A320 aircraft is shown in Fig. 7.13 [111].
The Boeing 777, whose maiden ﬂight was 10 years ago, is approximately 20 %
composites by weight with the composite materials being used for the wing’s ﬁxed
leading edge, trailing-edge panels, ﬂaps and ﬂaperons, spoilers, and outboard
ailerons. They have also been used for the ﬂoor beams, wing-to-body fairing, and

landing-gear doors. Using composite materials for the empennage saves approxi-
mately 1,500 lb in weight. The Boeing 787 will average the extensive use of
composite materials (estimates are as high as 50 %) in the quest for high efﬁciency
and performance with reduced weight. The composites are also used in major
structural elements of modern helicopters, which are approximately 50 % com-
posites by weight (Fig. 7.14). The formability of composites has been used to
particular advantage in helicopter manufacturing to reduce the number of compo-
nent parts and therefore, costs [112].
7.3.2 Automobiles
The automotive companies in the today’s world are forced to look for new ways
and innovations in manufacturing cars/trucks owing to ﬁerce competition. The cars
today should have all the features demanded by the customers at low cost. This has
led to the use of composite materials in the construction of parts such as the body,
interiors, chassis, hoods, and electrical components. The composite materials have
the desired properties to suit the requirements of the car manufacturers. Hence, the
composites are more signiﬁcant today and will continue to be in future in the

automobile industry. The recent innovations in the sphere of advanced composites
in the automotive manufacturing industry have led to the use of carbon ﬁber-
reinforced plastic (CFRP) with the various thermosets of thermoplastic composites
[113] (Figs. 7.15, 7.16, 7.17, 7.18, 7.19).

In recent years, compressed natural gas (CNG) has become an attractive alter-
native as a fuel for automobiles such as public buses. Compared to oil-based fuels,
the use of CNG reduces the emission of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides.
Furthermore, the use of carbon ﬁber-reinforced composites in the design of CNG
cylinders has led to attractive lightweight solutions. For the safety of the users, the
structural integrity of such composite cylinders must be accurately checked.
Fig. 7.16 CNG cylinders manufactured using ﬁber-reinforced composites
260
7
Recent Uses of Carbon Fibers

Nevertheless, the actual inspection techniques, derived from the techniques used for
steel cylinders, might not be well adapted for the composite materials [114].
CNG is an alternative fuel, which is stored under high pressure (3,600 psi) in the
vehicle [115]. The use of natural gas as an alternative fuel in automotive applica-
tions is not widespread primarily because of the high cost and durability of the
carbon ﬁber composite storage tanks. Carbon ﬁber composites are relatively
expensive because of the raw material cost of the carbon ﬁber, which accounts for
approximately 40 % of the total tank cost. By introducing large tow-size carbon
ﬁbers in the tank design, there exists potential for tremendous cost savings. The cost
of large tow-size carbon ﬁber is approximately one-half the cost of conventional
tow-size carbon ﬁber. However, not all of these savings re realized in the ﬁnal

overall tank cost because of the low ﬁber strength and low strength translation,
which has been demonstrated in large tow-size carbon ﬁber composite structures
[116, 117].
Composite CNG tanks are typically fabricated using the wet-ﬁlament winding
process. This is a process wherein the ﬁber tow is passed through a resin bath to
impregnate the tow and then wrapped around a mandrel prior to curing in an oven at
elevated temperatures [118].
7.3.3 Marine Applications
Recently, the carbon ﬁber-reinforced composites have been used widely in the
marine sector because of their excellent resistance to the marine environment [119].
Complex conﬁgurations combined with the advantages of seamless hulls drove the
development of CFRP boats. The racing power-boats employed advanced and
hybrid composites for high-performance craft and driver safety. Major structural
elements, viz. deckhouses, hatch covers, king posts, and bow modules, appeared to
be well suited for CFRP construction. Composite applications in the marine seg-
ment have been employed in high-speed boats, naval vessels, sail boats, ﬁshing
boats, high-capacity trawlers, barges, and other ship components since the begin-
ning of the last decade. The marine industry mainly consumed the carbon ﬁber-
reinforced epoxy as the composite material. The advanced composite materials in
vessels have the potential to reduce fabrication and maintenance costs, enhance
styling, reduce outﬁt weight, and increase reliability [120, 121].
7.3.4 Wind Turbine Blades
Wind turbine blades convert mechanical energy provided by wind into electrical
energy. They are used in machines designed for directing and concentrating energy
Fig. 7.19 Carbon ﬁber/PEEK/ceramic composite for turbine blades
262

from the air into a wire that connects the turbine generator to an electrical grid
[122]. The cost of energy is dependent on advanced and cost-effective solutions for
manufacturing enormous composite structures such as wind blades. The composites
are cost-effective materials for large diameter blades and provide the requisite
strength and stiffness in structures [123].
Wind turbine blades must be lightweight, rigid and show fatigue resistance
throughout a typical 10-year service life. Such requirements favor advanced com-
posites as the material of choice. A typical wind turbine blade consists of an outer
shell supported by a main spar. Traditional materials of the spar used E-glass
reinforcing ﬁbers bound in an unsaturated polymer resin matrix. Epoxy as a matrix
resin offers better tensile and ﬂexural strength, while the carbon ﬁbers have an
extremely high stiffness to density ratio, allowing for longer, lighter turbine blades.
Therefore, newer wind turbine blades have been manufactured using carbon ﬁber-
reinforced composites [124, 125].
7.3.5 Sports Applications
Sports serve as the test platform for carbon ﬁbers. Carbon ﬁbers are relevant for the
sporting goods market as well as commercial applications. With the advanced in the
production and applications of technologies, carbon ﬁbers frequently appear in the
sporting goods. Over the years, carbon ﬁbers have been used to make golf clubs,
hockey sticks, and bicycle stands. Carbon ﬁbers are also found in rackets, ﬁshing
rods, snowboards, windsurﬁng masts, marine hulls, backpacks, tent poles, softballs,
and baseball bats [126, 127].
1. Rackets in CFRP
The relative importance of the basic elements of racket constructions, shaft and
head-string system, varies with the sport—the head-string system being more
dominant wherein the ball momentum is high (tennis) and shaft action being more
important, for example, in badminton. High-speed photographic analysis of a ball
hitting a squash racket, with a synchronized strain recording on the shaft, has shown
that at impact (zero ball velocity), the kinetic energy of the ball was absorbed in the
racket and distributed between shaft strain energy and head-string energy in the
ratio 1/10. This ratio varied with different shafts, decreasing for more ﬂexible shafts,
but it indicated the smaller contribution of the shaft in the energy exchange. In the
various racket types, head and shaft need to be appropriately matched. The principal
function of the head frame is to provide a stable structural form that will coun-
terbalance the string tension without distortion. Because the stressing will be pri-
marily compressive, high stiffness as well as strength will be important, and hence,
CFRP is likely to be advantageous in this region, especially in badminton, wherein
a minimum weight is required. The principal problem in ﬁber design is the holding
of the strings without introducing drilled holes into CFRP and this can be achieved
7.3
Applications of Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Composites
263

in various ways, including the use of material sandwich constructions. Attention
must also be paid to the torsion requirements at the shaft-head transition [128].
Because steel-like mechanical properties can be attained in CFRP, it is a
tempting starting point simply to replace a tapered high-strength steel tube with an
equivalent CFRP element. This approach was used in the racket shown in Fig. 7.20
with shafts formed in unidirectional high-modulus carbon ﬁber and epoxy resin.
These lightweight rackets have satisfactory playing characteristics and endured an
18-month assessment period of severe and varied play. Despite their relatively low
torsional rigidity, surprisingly little effect was observed during play [129].
Other types of rackets, particularly badminton and tennis, will undoubtedly
beneﬁt from the use of carbon ﬁbers. In both these cases, the latest design devel-
opments have involved all-metal tubular construction in an attempt to establish a
technically efﬁcient design. In the tennis racket, the modiﬁcation of wood con-
structions with CFRP will strengthen and produce lighter designs. The tennis racket
manufactured from the carbon ﬁber-reinforced plastic is shown in Fig. 7.21.

2. Golf shaft
It is generally agreed that it is desirable to aim for minimum-weight shafts that have
sufﬁcient stiffness, strength, and impact resistance to fulﬁll the basic shaft function
of accelerating and positioning the club-head; a typical mean value of a medium-
stiffness shaft is 50 Nm2. Large weight savings (50 % is easily attainable) are
possible in CFRP shafts and this results in a calculable hitting advantage but it is
more likely that the appeal of the CFRP as a shaft material will be in its unique
design possibilities with a more modest weight reduction.
These basic requirements have been adequately met by CFRP shafts of various
constructions, using both low-modulus and high-modulus carbon ﬁbers, and
worthwhile weight reductions gained. The CFRP shafts (Fig. 7.22) have satisﬁed
basic playing needs and indicated that the use of CFRP is feasible and likely to be
advantageous. Reﬁnement of design is possible, including accurate matching of head
to shaft and controlled variation within sets, because precise material formulations
can alter the static and vibrational characteristics of shafts. The balance between the
torsional and ﬂexural stiffness, for example, is a design parameter [130, 131].

7.3.6 Construction
In recent decades, material development in response to a call for more durable
infrastructures has led to many exciting advancements. Fiber-reinforced composite
designs with unique properties are now being explored in many infrastructural
applications. Even concrete and steel are being steadily improved to have better
properties and durability.
Fiber-reinforced cement–matrix composites are structural materials, which are
gaining importance rapidly owing to the increasing demand of superior structural and
functional properties. In particular, the carbon ﬁbers are one of the most common
components for reinforcing cementitious materials because of their excellent
mechanical properties [132, 133]. When carbon ﬁbers are incorporated into the
cementitious matrix, some properties of the carbon ﬁber-reinforced cement–matrix
composites (CFRCCs) are improved, including the tensile strength, ﬂexural strength,
compressive strength, toughness, and drying shrinkage [134, 135]. Therefore, the
carbon ﬁbers are generally used as a reinforcement material to enhance the mechanical
properties of a brittle matrix such as cement paste and especially nonround carbon
ﬁbers are more effective for strengthening compared to the round ones [136, 137].
Parketal.[138]usedcarbonﬁbersforthereinforcementofcement.Inthiswork,the
effect of different cross section types on the mechanical properties of carbon ﬁber-
reinforced cement composites was investigated. To study the effect of shape factor, the
mechanical properties of three types of carbon ﬁbers, round, H-shaped, and C-shaped
randomly oriented CFRCCs, were investigated. As a result, C-shaped CFRCC
showed higher tensile and ﬂexural strength compared to any other shape of carbon
ﬁber-reinforced composites. It was observed that the C-shaped CFRCC presented
stronger ﬁber-matrix interfacial adhesive forces owing to the mechanical anchorage
into the matrix. However, the compressive strength of the CFRCC decreased with the
increasing aspect ratio andﬁbervolume fraction. Thiswas probablybecause ofthefact
that the amounts of entrained air contents increased during the mixing of each ﬁber.
Also, both the tensile and ﬂexural strengths of the CFRCC were signiﬁcantly
increased by the additions of fumed silica to the composites. Figure 7.23 shows the
ﬂexural strength of CFRCC as a function of the ﬁber volume fraction. The ﬂexural
strength of CFRCC increased with the increasing ﬁber volume fraction and the
CFRCC containing fumed silica showed higher ﬂexural strength compared to that
of the CFRCC without fumed silica because of the increasing interfacial areas
between the ﬁbers and matrix, resulting from the densiﬁcation of the microstructure
[139, 140]. Also, the C-CFRCC showed higher ﬂexural strengths compared to those
of R- or H-CFRCC, regardless of the presence of fumed silica, as shown in
Fig. 7.23. In particular, the C-CFRCC containing fumed silica showed the highest
ﬂexural strength, approximately 40 % higher compared to those of R- and H-
CFRCC in a ﬁber volume fraction of 3 %. This was probably because of the fact
that the inside space of the C-shaped carbon ﬁbers was compacted by the matrix
and the ﬁbers, thus, acted as mechanical anchors, resulting from the C-shaped
carbon ﬁbers having a large interface between the ﬁbers and matrix.

Recent Uses of Carbon Fibers

The SEM micrographs for C-shaped carbon ﬁbers distributed in the cement
matrix are shown in Fig. 7.24. The ﬁbers were distributed homogeneously in the
cement matrix and in good contact with each other within an individual cluster,
although the clusters were separate.
Cement reinforced with short carbon ﬁbers is attractive owing to its high ﬂexural
strength and toughness and low drying shrinkage, in addition to its strain-sensing
ability [141–144]. Xu and Chung [144] reported the silane-treated carbon ﬁber-
reinforced cement, which showed improved properties. In this work, the isotropic

pitch-based and unsized carbon ﬁbers (length: *5 mm) were used and their
properties are listed in Table 7.9.
Tables 7.9 and 7.10 show the tensile strength and modulus, respectively, of 12
types of cement pastes. The strength slightly increased while the modulus slightly
decreased owing to the addition of methylcellulose and defoamer. However, both
strength and modulus increased owing to the addition of ﬁbers. The effectiveness of
the ﬁbers in enhancing the strength and modulus increased in the following order:
as-received < O3-treated < dichromate-treated < silane-treated. This trend was
indifferent to the use of either as-received or silane-treated silica fumes. For all the
formulations, the silane-treated silica fumes yielded substantially higher strength
and modulus compared to that yielded by the as-received silica fumes. The highest
tensile strength and modulus were exhibited by the cement paste with silane-treated
silica fumes and silane-treated ﬁbers; the strength was 56 % higher, while the
modulus was 39 % higher than those of the cement paste with as-received silica
fumes and as-received ﬁbers. The strength was 26 % higher, while the modulus was
14 % higher than those of the cement paste with as-received silica fumes and silane-
treated ﬁbers. Hence, the silane treatment with both silica fumes and ﬁbers was
nearly equally valuable in enhancing the overall strength.

Recent Uses of Carbon Fibers

7.4 Applications of Carbon/Carbon Composites
Unlike many high-temperature alloys and ceramics, carbon/carbon composites (C/C
composites) do not undergo degradation in strength above 2,000 °C in inert
environments. They have excellent thermal stability coupled with high mechanical
performance either in an inert atmosphere or vacuum. However, the main drawback
of carbon-based materials is low oxidation resistance. Although the high speciﬁc
strength and speciﬁc stiffness, and strength retention at elevated temperatures make
C/C composites an attractive structural material, the issue of carbon oxidation limits
their use [145].
Carbon oxidizes readily at temperatures above 400 °C. Therefore, numerous
investigations attempted to protect the C/C composites from oxidation. Park and Seo
[146] reported the effect of oxidation inhibitors, i.e., MoSi2, on the oxidation behavior
of C/C composites. In this work, the PAN-based carbon ﬁbers impregnated with
phenolic resin used as a precursor of the carbonized matrix were modiﬁed by the
addition of molybdenum disilicide (MoSi2) at different concentrations, i.e., 0, 4, 12,
and 20 % by weight for improving the antioxidation properties of the composites. In
this work, the oxidation behavior of C/C composites made using MoSi2 as an oxi-
dation inhibitor in ﬂowing air has been studied over the temperature range
600–1,000 °C. The results showed that the oxidation behavior of the composites
made without the use of MoSi2 differed from those of the composites made using
MoSi2 and involved a degradation mechanism of its own, resulting in the highest
oxidation rate during the initial phase of the oxidation. The composites made using
MoSi2 led to a signiﬁcantly improved oxidation resistance owing to both the
reduction of the crack in composites and the formation of a mobile diffusion barrier
for oxygen when compared to those made without using MoSi2. Hence, the carbon
active sites were blocked and the oxidation of carbon was limited. This was probably
owing to the effect of the inherent MoSi2 properties, resulted from the formation of
the protective layer against oxygen attack above 800 °C.
The composites consisting of different contents of the oxidation inhibitor MoSi2
displayed an increase of the work of adhesion between the ﬁbers and matrix, which
improved both the fracture toughness and impact properties of the composites. The
12 wt.% MoSi2 composites exhibited the strongest mechanical and mechanical
interfacial properties. This was probably because of the improvement of the London
dispersive L component, WLA, of the work of adhesion, resulting in an increase in
the interfacial adhesion force among the ﬁbers, ﬁller, and matrix in this system.

Carbon Fibers and Their Composites
Soo-Jin Park and Byung-Joo Kim
Abstract Traditionally, the application of carbon ﬁbers has been limited to very
special ﬁelds such as aerospace and military because of their high cost. However,
various techniques for low-cost carbon ﬁbers are under development in terms of
using low-cost precursors, low-cost manufacturing processes, and even functional
coating methods. Moreover, future applications of carbon ﬁbers can widen not only
as structural reinforcements but also in information technology-based applications
such as housings for electric devices, smart cloths, and healthcare items. In this
chapter, we will cover the carbon ﬁbers and their composites in recent various
applications. In particular, there are classiﬁed as a low-cost production technique of
carbon ﬁbers for general industries, thin carbon ﬁbers for extreme industries, and
functional carbon ﬁbers for smart composites.
8.1 Low-Cost Production Technique of Carbon Fibers
for General Industries
Carbon ﬁbers are ultralight and show high conductivity and high thermal resistance.
It is used as a core material in composites in aerospace, sports, automotive, defense,
and semiconductor industries. However, commercial carbon ﬁbers are excessively
expensive ($33/kg) to be widely used in the automotive and construction industries.
Recently, there have been extensive efforts to produce low-cost (<$11/kg) carbon
ﬁbers with excellent properties.
Figure 8.1 shows the price structure of carbon ﬁbers. As shown in Fig. 8.1, the
precursors contribute to the largest proportion of cost (51 %), while the oxidative

stabilization step accounts for 18 % of the cost. Therefore, low-cost precursors and
oxidative stabilization for low energy consumption are essential (Fig. 8.2).
In this chapter, we explain the use of low-cost precursors for the production of
biomass-based low-cost carbon ﬁbers by low-cost manufacturing processes.
Lignin is the most abundant natural polymer and exists in the walls of plant cells
as a main ingredient [2–13]. It is readily available and relatively cheap and is
structurally appealing as a precursor for carbon ﬁbers. It is a high molecular weight
polyaromatic macromolecule with a reported total worldwide production of
approximately 26 million ton/year [2]. Kadla et al. [3] reported the production of
the ﬁrst lignin-based carbon ﬁbers from commercial kraft lignin using a thermal
extrusion process. Fusible lignin was used to form a ﬁne ﬁlament of carbon ﬁber by
a thermal pretreatment under vacuum. Figure 8.3 shows the carbon ﬁbers produced

form hardwood kraft lignin. The carbon ﬁbers were produced at an overall yield of
45 %. The tensile strength and modulus increased with decrease in the ﬁber
diameter, and the values are comparable to those of much smaller-diameter carbon
ﬁbers produced from phenolated exploded lignin. The ﬁbers show a promising
tensile strength of 400–550 MPa and a modulus of 30–60 GPa, and hence, kraft
lignin should be further investigated as a precursor for general-grade carbon ﬁbers
(Table 8.1).
Qin et al. [4] investigated the effect of organoclay on lignin-based carbon ﬁbers.
Table 8.2 shows the textural properties of carbon ﬁbers with and without organo-
clay reinforcement. The tensile strength of pyrolytic lignin-based carbon ﬁbers was
improved by organoclay reinforcement at loadings below 1.0 wt%. Increasing the
organoclay content above 1.0 wt% resulted in a drop in the tensile strength of
carbon ﬁbers, although this was also accompanied by an increase in the ﬁber
diameter, which is known to decrease the tensile strength. The addition of or-
ganoclay to pyrolytic lignin can improve the mechanical properties of the lignin-
based carbon ﬁbers.
Maradur et al. [5] have made attempts to develop lignin-based carbon ﬁbers
made of a copolymer of lignin with acrylonitrile. Using a wet spinning process, the
PAN–lignin copolymers were then spun into ﬁbers. The carbon ﬁbers were

prepared by the subsequent thermal treatment of the spun ﬁbers. A variety of
physical changes were observed to occur during the thermostabilization process,
which cause the initial changes in the color of the spun ﬁbers from pale yellow to
dark brown (Fig. 8.4).
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the as-spun, stabilized, and
carbonized ﬁbers obtained at low and high magniﬁcations are shown in Fig. 8.5.
The average diameter of the ﬁbers decreases from 20 to 15 to 11 μm with increase
in heat treatment. The drastic volumetric changes involved complex physical and
chemical reactions, such as carbon densiﬁcation and gas evolution. At high

magniﬁcation, the surface of the carbonized ﬁbers became rougher and developed
striped patterns, and the carbonized ﬁbers appeared more porous than the ﬁbers
stabilized through the pyrolysis process at high temperature.
An increased awareness that nonrenewable resources are becoming scarce and
our dependence on renewable resources have increased. This century could be
called the cellulosic century because more and more renewable plant resources for
products are being discovered. It has been generally stated that natural ﬁbers are
renewable and sustainable. The living plants from which the natural ﬁbers are taken
are renewable and sustainable, while the ﬁbers themselves are not renewable.
Table 8.3 shows the main ﬁbers used commercially in composites, which are now
produced worldwide [6]. Also, the natural ﬁber types are listed in Table 8.4 [7].
If carbon ﬁbers can be prepared from biomass-based natural ﬁbers, which are
abundant in nature and less expensive, it would be desirable and useful, although
the ﬁbers are not continuous, limited in ﬁber length, and show relatively low
mechanical properties in comparison with conventional rayon-based and PAN-
based carbon ﬁbers.
Cho et al. [8] investigated the effect of alkali pretreatment of jute-based carbon
ﬁbers. Figure 8.6 displays the SEM images of the cross sections of jute ﬁbers before

and after carbonization. Raw jute ﬁbers consist of a number of cells, typically found
in cellulose-based natural ﬁbers. After carbonization, clearly the inner structure
(struts between the cells) of the ﬁber became dense and showed the presence of
smaller cells with different sizes. It seemed that some cells were fused or combined
together, indicating that reorganization of the inner structure may have occurred
during carbonization.
8.2 Thin Carbon Fibers for Extreme Industries
In Sect. 8.1, the low-cost techniques of production of carbon ﬁbers were over-
viewed for applications in general industries. In this section, carbon ﬁbers with
remarkable physical performances will be focused on for applications in extreme
industries. Normally, T-1000-grade carbon ﬁbers from Toray Co. Ltd are recog-
nized as high-performance carbon ﬁbers. However, in this section, super-perfor-
mance carbon ﬁbers, which can be used in space or deep seas or those that can be
applied in parts where normal high-performance carbon ﬁbers cannot be applied,
will be discussed. Practically, after the proposal of building a space elevator made
of carbon nanotubes, many researchers have been trying to evaluate a variety of
materials for their suitableness. However, the limitation of normal carbon ﬁbers
with respect to physical strengths for extreme applications has urged many scien-
tists to research the production of super carbon ﬁbers. Among many research topics,
high-strength carbon ﬁbers with nanometric diameters have gained much attention.
Carbon ﬁbers with nanometric diameters can be typically divided into two types.
The carbon ﬁbers can be manufactured by electrospinning. In this process, poly-
meric long ﬁbers or nanoﬁber webs are slit, twisted, oriented, and ﬁnally carbon-
ized. The other types of carbon ﬁbers can be produced by wet or dry yarning of
carbon nanotubes. The carbon ﬁbers made by these methods cannot be produced at

suitable costs and failed to show the physical performance as super carbon ﬁbers,
although it may be possible to produce super carbon ﬁbers for application in
extreme industries by dry or wet yarning.
8.2.1 Continuous Carbon Nanoﬁbers
8.2.1.1 Submicron Carbon Fibers
The diameter of commercial carbon ﬁbers is in the range 6–12 µm [9]. The ﬁber
diameter determines the speciﬁc surface area of the ﬁber and the ﬁber–resin
interfaces. Normally, mechanical and interfacial properties of composites reinforced
with carbon ﬁbers depend on the interfacial adhesion between the ﬁber surface and
the matrices [10]. Therefore, smaller ﬁber diameter can lead to higher interfacial
adhesion because of the increase in the interface of the ﬁller matrix. Hence, several
carbon ﬁber manufacturers speciﬁcally focus on submicron carbon ﬁbers.
In submicron carbon ﬁbers, the ﬁber diameter ranges from several hundred
nanometers to three micrometers. These carbon ﬁbers can be produced from very
ﬁne polymer ﬁbers obtained by high orientation process. However, it is challenging
to apply these thin carbon ﬁbers to general industries because of their high man-
ufacturing cost, low production scales, low carbonization yields, and large fraction
of worsted ﬁbers [11−15].
However, various methods (some of which are listed below) have been devel-
oped for precursor treatment.
1. Bicomponent spinning
The formation of nanoﬁbers by bicomponent spinning is a two-step process,
which involves (1) spinning islands-in-the sea (INS) or segmented pie bicom-
ponent ﬁbers and (2) the removal of one component [16, 17]. INS ﬁbers, ﬁrst
created by Toray Industries, typically consist of a large number of individual
“islands” of one polymer surrounded by a “sea” or matrix of another polymer
[18–22]. The sea polymer is removed by dissolution with a solvent or by melting
to leave ultraﬁne ﬁlaments. The most frequently investigated approach is to spin
INS ﬁbers using melt spinning processes. Figure 8.7 shows nanoﬁbers obtained
by bicomponent spinning. Several hundreds of nanoﬁbers are observed [23].
2. Melt-blowing technique
Today, melt-blowing [24] is the primary production technique used to obtain
small-diameter ﬁbers. The melt-blowing technique developed in the 1950s [25] at
the Naval Research Laboratory is a nonwoven manufacturing process, in which a
polymer melt is extruded through dies, attenuated by heated high-velocity air
streams (typically at the same temperature as the molten polymer) and spun into
8.2

281

ﬁbers. Nonwoven webs composed of 500-nm ﬁbers were produced in a melt-
blowing process using different combinations of primary plates and secondary
plates in a modular die plate assembly. Polypropylene nanoﬁbers with an average
diameter of 250 nm were melt-blown using a special die. Melt-blowing may be
used to produce INS ﬁbers containing more than 600 island ﬁbrils with diameters
as low as 50 nm [26].
3. Flash spinning technique
Flash spinning is a modiﬁed version of the spunbonded technology in which a
polymer such as polypropylene is dissolved and extruded and the solvent is
made to rapidly evaporate at the spinneret, which causes the individual ﬁlaments
to be disrupted into a highly ﬁbrillar form, which collected on a moving screen
to form a web. As a further development to the melt-blowing process, ﬂash
spinning has been used to produce plexiﬁlamentary ﬁlm-ﬁbril strands consisting
of ultraﬁne ﬁbers from a spin ﬂuid. Flash spinning processes [27] developed to
date do not produce ﬁbrous webs composed completely of nanoﬁbers, though a
polyoleﬁn nonwoven ﬁbrous structure comprising both micrometer ﬁbers and
sub-micrometer ﬁbers is available.
4. Electrospinning
Electrospinning [28–32] has received much attention as a technique to produce
various ultraﬁne polymeric ﬁbers, which are otherwise difﬁcult to fabricate by other
methods. It has been demonstrated to be a simple and viable method to produce
Fig. 8.7 Nanoﬁbers obtained

282

Carbon Fibers and Their Composites

ﬁbers with diameters in the range of nanometers to submicrometers from polymers,
ceramics, composite materials, and metals in the form of solution or melt [30].
8.2.1.2 Long Carbon Fibers by Electrospinning
Several types of methods such as vapor-grown method, laser ablation, arc plasma,
and electrospinning followed by carbonization have been developed for the prep-
aration of carbon nanoﬁbers [33–35]. In addition to these, the electrospinning
method can produce polymeric nanoﬁbers of various sizes ranging from ten
nanometers to a few micrometers. Moreover, essential equipment is less expensive
than that used in other methods. In electrospinning, the applied electric ﬁeld and
solution conductivity are important parameters, which inﬂuence the ﬁber diameter
during spinning in addition to parameters such as the surface tension of solution, jet
length, solution viscosity, surrounding temperature and humidity, solution feeding
rate, collector materials, and collection speed. Figure 8.8 shows the electrospinning
apparatus and mechanism [36].
Various polymers such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN) [37, 38], polyvinyl alcohol
(PVA) [39, 40], and polyimide (PI) [41, 42] can be electrospun when the viscosity is
controlled by heat or solvent. To make continuous carbon ﬁbers, electrospun
polymeric nanoﬁbers are carbonized at temperatures exceeding 1,000 °C. Contin-
uous carbon nanoﬁber is a long thin strand of material with a diameter of approxi-
mately 5–200 nm, composed mostly of carbon atoms bonded together in
microscopic crystals and aligned parallel to the long axis of the ﬁber. Among various
polymers, PAN is a predominant candidate to obtain carbon materials because of
possibility of obtaining a high carbon yield after the carbonization process.
The preparation of continuous carbon ﬁbers from PAN nanoﬁbers involves three
main stages, i.e., electrospinning, oxidative stabilization, and carbonization [43].
Suitable stabilization of the electrospun PAN nanoﬁbers is essential for high carbon

yields and good physical strength. Stabilization involves heating PAN nanoﬁbers in
an air atmosphere. During the stabilization process, cyano groups (–C≡N) undergo
cyclization and N-containing benzene-like structures are formed (as shown in
Fig. 8.9). This is why PAN is used as a carbon precursor [44]. This process prevents
melting during subsequent carbonization, resulting in high carbon yield and good
ﬁber shapes. In the next step, stabilized nanoﬁbers are carbonized in an inert
atmosphere to increase the carbon content by removing noncarbonized components
in the form of gases such as H2O, NH3, CO, HCN, CO2, and N2 with a yield of
approximately 50–60 % [45, 46].
Fibers and yarns have a long history, although remarkable progress has been
achieved in the technology in the last few decades. The applications of ﬁbers and
yarns have move beyond traditional textiles, and the materials are increasingly used
in high value-added applications, as in composites, ﬁltration media, gas separation,
sensors, and biomedical engineering. However, according to process requirements,
single nanoﬁbers cannot be used directly in weaving, knitting, and embroidery partly
because of their fragile nature. It is more convenient to handle linear nanoﬁber
assemblies such as nanoﬁber bundles or yarns instead of a single nanoﬁber [47].
Though electrospun carbon nanoﬁbers show many merits for easy commer-
cialization, several bottlenecks still remain. Among others, electrospun nanoﬁbers
are in weblike form and a postprocess is required for the production of continuous
carbon nanoﬁbers. In the traditional textile engineering, a nonwoven web can be
transformed into continuous ﬁbers by the processing steps consisting of the ori-
entation of the web, slitting of the web, and then twisting of the slit web. Yarn twist
reduces the strength variability by increasing the interﬁber lateral interaction and
friction [48]. An examination of the mechanical properties of dried and twisted
yarns of electrospun PAN nanoﬁbers has shown that the initial modulus and the
ultimate strength increase with increase in the twist angle. Properties, including
yarn diameter, ﬁber count, and twist per unit length, can be adjusted by the rotation
rate of the collector disk. Twist also lowers the strength, which can be attributed to a
number of factors, including the increased ﬁber angle relative to the yarn axis. The
frictional and normal forces arising from twist may damage or roughen the surface
of PAN nanoﬁber in yarns.

A series processing steps can be also accomplished with other types of ﬁbers
such as polymer and ceramic ﬁbers acting as core ﬁbers. Figure 8.10 shows the
process of transforming electrospun nanoﬁber webs into continuous nanoﬁbers.
In order to avoid complex transform manufacturing, the development of a direct
long nanoﬁber electrospinning has been researched. These processes are basically
based on the collecting techniques, which result in highly oriented continuous
nanoﬁbers. Figure 8.11 shows a modiﬁed centrifugal electrospinning device [49].

This electrospinning device is composed of a high-speed rotatable polymer
feeder and a round metal collector. The conventional electrospinning device can
produce nonoriented polymer nanoﬁber webs. However, this device can produce
unidirectionally oriented nanoﬁber webs (or bundle) because of the high rotation
speed of the polymer feeder during the spinning process.
Figure 8.12 shows the SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
of the nanoﬁbers electrospun by the modiﬁed centrifugal electrospinning device. The
nanoﬁbers and CNTs in the ﬁbers were observed to be well aligned along the axis of
the electrospun nanoﬁbers. Because of the elongation of the ﬂuid jet, the nanotubes
were oriented along the streamlines of the electrospinning solution [49].
Figure 8.13a illustrates the setup used for the electrospinning experiments. The
conﬁguration is essentially the same as that used in a conventional setup except for
the use of a collector containing a gap in its middle. Such a collector could be
simply fabricated by putting two stripes of electrical conductors together or by
cutting a piece of aluminum foil. The width of the gap could be varied from

hundreds of micrometers to several centimeters. Figure 8.13b shows a cross-
sectional view of the electric ﬁeld strength vectors between the needle and the
grounded collector calculated using the Student’s Quick Field program. Unlike the
conventional system, the electric ﬁeld lines in the vicinity of the collector were split
into two fractions pointing toward the opposite edges of the gap. Figure 8.13c
illustrates the electrostatic forces acting on a charged nanoﬁber spanning the gap.
The as-spun ﬁber can be considered to be a string of positively charged elements
connected through a viscoelastic medium [50].
In general, the charged nanoﬁber should experience two sets of electrostatic
forces, the ﬁrst set (F1) originating from the splitting electric ﬁeld and the second
one between the charged ﬁber and image charges induced on the surfaces of the two
grounded electrodes (F2).
Meanwhile, two separate collectors can produce uniaxially aligned polymer
nanoﬁbers. Figure 8.14a shows a typical optical micrograph of polyvinylpyrroli-
done (PVP) nanoﬁbers electrospun from a solution containing 0.5 g of PVP and
4.2 mg of tetramethylammonium chloride in a mixture of 8 mL of ethanol and 4 mL
of water and collected over a gap formed between two stripes of silicon substrates.
Figure 8.14b shows the SEM images of the same sample, which displays nanoﬁbers
deposited across the gap and on top of the silicon stripe. These images clearly
indicate that the polymer nanoﬁbers were uniaxially aligned across the gap with
their longitudinal axes oriented perpendicular to the edges of the gap [50].

Figure 8.15 shows a rotatable net cylindrical collector. This collector combines
each merit of other collectors mentioned above. This collector can lead to uniaxially
aligned and highly oriented nanoﬁbers [51].
As shown in the SEM images (Fig. 8.16), good alignment could be achieved up
to approximately 15 min of electrospinning. After 15 min, the mat of ﬁbers begins
to thicken and entanglements form. However, decent alignment could still be
achieved present up to 40 min, as shown in Fig. 8.16g–h. After longer periods of
time, the ﬁbers spin in random patterns and the alignment is gradually lost as the
thickness of the ﬁber mat increases, as shown in Fig. 8.16i after 2.5 h of elec-
trospinning. Figures 8.16a–c show that excellent alignment is observed after only
ﬁve minutes of electrospinning. Figure 8.16g shows an example of how the ﬁbers
can entangle or be disturbed if not carefully collected, vastly changing the prop-
erties of the aligned ﬁbers [51].

Carbon Fibers and Their Composites

Recently, novel electrospinning processes have been researched. However, the
mechanical performances of continuous carbon nanoﬁbers obtained from electro-
spun continuous nanoﬁbers are insufﬁcient for these materials to be used as ﬁllers in
composites. Many problems such as full orientation, advanced twisting, or
hybridization with other ﬁbers still remain.
Mass production of continuous electrospun nanoﬁbers is now possible, and
hence, obtaining super carbon nanoﬁbers by electrospinning techniques with very
high mechanical properties and optimized carbonization process is foreseeable.
The investigation of fabrics of nanoﬁber yarns is very much in its infancy, given
that nanoﬁber yarns have not yet been produced on a commercial scale. Nanoﬁber
woven fabrics can be used in artiﬁcial leather, ﬁlters, diapers, sanitary pads, sutures,
antisetting agents, wiping cloths, artiﬁcial vessels, bone-ﬁxing devices, and so on.
Nanoﬁber fabrics with simple structures have been woven in recent years for a new
generation of textiles such as scaffold fabrics, electronic fabrics, and responsive
fabrics.
Nanoﬁber yarns with excellent mechanical properties have at least sufﬁcient

generally recognized that both the inner structures of the ﬁbers and the alignment
between ﬁbers play a key role in the mechanical properties of yarns.
8.2.2 Carbon Nanotube (CNT) Yarns
In addition, an aspiring manufacturing method for super carbon ﬁbers is using
CNTs to form long ﬁber yarns. The ﬁrst generation of CNT yarns was produced by
wet spinning process using polymer binder and CNT ﬁllers. After the development
of vertically grown CNTs, the CNTs were processed into ﬁbers by the dry method,
which is very much similar to pulling cotton yarns. Finally, the dry CNT yarning
technique has evolved such that the CNT synthesis and yarning are concerted. The
mechanical properties of CNTs vary depending on the arrangement of hexagonal
rings constituting them and the number of walls, and the properties of individual
CNTs are superior to commercialized high-performance ﬁbers [52–60].
8.2.2.1 Carbon Nanoﬁbers from CNT Yarns by Wet Methods
The ﬁrst critical challenge in the development of this method is the difﬁculty of
processing CNTs in liquid state. CNTs are inert in pristine state and tend to bundle
together because of the strong van der Waals interactions, making them difﬁcult to
disperse uniformly in aqueous or any organic solvents. Some special methods
involving oxidation and grafting with different functionalities [61–65] have been
used to overcome this issue; however, these methods normally destroy the intrinsic
structure and properties of the CNTs. Thus, these methods are unfavorable for ﬁber
spinning. Shaffer and Windle [66] have previously suggested that CNTs can be
viewed analogously with high-aspect-ratio rigid-rod polymers. According to this
analog, CNTs can be used in two types of solution-based spinning methods, i.e.,
coagulation spinning and liquid crystal solution spinning. Figure 8.17 shows how
CNT yarns can be produced by using the wet method.
Generally, the principle of the coagulation spinning used for synthetic ﬁber
processing involves the extrusion of a polymer solution through a thin capillary
tube and injection of the extruded material into a bath containing a second liquid,
which removes the solvent, leaving behind the polymer, which condenses and
forms a ﬁber because of phase separation. To employing the coagulation spinning
method for CNT ﬁber fabrication, the CNTs need to be dispersed into a liquid
solution at an almost molecular level so that they could be manipulated and aligned
well. Surfactants are widely used for this purpose because of their ability to absorb/
wrap at the surface of individual CNTs and prevent them from rebundling. This
spinning approach was initially adopted by Vigolo et al. [67]. Their processes
consisted of dispersing the CNTs in solution and then recondensing them in a
stream of another solution, which served as the coagulant [67].

SWNTs produced by arc discharge were ﬁrst dispersed in an aqueous solution
using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as surfactant. The dispersion was then injected
into a rotating bath of aqueous polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution, which served as
the coagulant. During this process, PVA displaced the surfactant, causing CNTs to
collapse and form ribbon-like elastomeric gel ﬁbers. These fragile ﬁbers were
pulled from the coagulation bath at a rate of approximately 0.01 m/min to form
solid ﬁbers. These ﬁbers were washed by immersing in a water container to remove
excess PVA and surfactant residues and were dried by pulling them out of water
bath. The amount of SDS was one critical parameter determining the making of a
good dispersion of CNTs. When the concentration of SDS was excessively low,
large and dense clusters of CNTs remained in solution even after sonication,
indicating that the amount of surfactant was excessively low to produce an efﬁcient
coating and induce sufﬁcient electrostatic repulsion, which could counterbalance
van der Waals attractions. On the other hand, when the concentration of SDS was
excessively high, the osmotic pressure of the excess micelles caused depletion-
induced aggregation. An optically homogeneous solution could be formed with
0.35 wt% of CNTs of a particular diameter and length and 1 wt% of SDS. In
addition, ﬂow-induced alignment could lead to the preferential orientation of CNTs
in ﬁbers [67−69]. The coagulant is required to ﬂow faster than the gel ﬁber to
stretch the ﬁber along the axial direction and promote alignment of the CNTs in the
ﬁber. This could be accomplished by rotating the coagulant container. This coag-
ulation-based ﬁber spinning technique is exciting because of its simplicity and
ability to produce ﬁbers with very high CNT loadings (60 wt%). The ﬁnal CNT/
PVA composite ﬁbers exhibited a tensile strength in the order of 0.1 GPa, and the
Young’s modulus varied between 9 and 15 GPa. In contrast to most ordinary
carbon ﬁbers, the CNT ﬁbers could be heavily bent and even tightly tied without
breaking. The main challenges existing in this method include the dispersion of
SWNTs at high concentrations, low processing rate, and the poor ﬁber perfor-
mance. To improve the mechanical performance of the as-spun CNT ﬁbers, various

modiﬁed methods have been developed. By drying CNT ﬁbers under load,
improved mechanical properties were obtained and a tensile strength of 230 MPa
and a Young’s modulus of 45 GPa was achieved [70, 71].
By hot drawing the ﬁbers, Miaudet et al. [71] drew such PVA ﬁbers at elevated
temperatures and the ﬁbers yielded strength of 1.8 GPa, modulus of 45 GPa, and
toughness of 55 J/g at 11 % strain. Dalton et al. [72] further advanced the spinning
apparatus to spin ﬁbers continuously by injecting CNT dispersions into a cylinder
with the coagulant ﬂowing in the same direction. They were able to spin a reel of
CNT gel ﬁbers and then converted it into 100 m of solid CNT composite ﬁbers at a
rate of more than 0.70 m/min. The ﬁnal ﬁbers exhibited an increased mechanical
performance with a tensile strength of 1.8 GPa and a Young’s modulus of up to
80 GPa. Coagulation spinning has also been carried out with solutions other than
PVA. For example, Lynam et al. [73] produced CNT bioﬁbers based on a wet
spinning process in which biomolecules acted as both the dispersant and the
coagulant. These ﬁbers possessed strength of 0.17 GPa and modulus of 0.146 GPa.
Because the existence of the second component polymer can be expected to add
complicity of processing and this second component is usually an insulator, which
will compromise the conductive property of the as-spun ﬁbers, pure CNT ﬁbers are
favorable in some circumstances. Kozlov et al. [74] developed a polymer-free
solution spinning method. Pure CNT ﬁbers could be produced from CNT/surfac-
tant/water solutions. However, the mechanical properties of the as-spun ﬁbers with
speciﬁc strength of 65 MPa/g cm3, speciﬁc modulus of 12 GPa/g cm3, and electrical
conductivity of 140 S/cm were not impressive.
8.2.2.2 Carbon Nanoﬁbers from CNT Yarns by Dry Methods
To eliminate the challenges encountered in making dispersions in the case of solu-
tion-based spinning methods, spinning CNT ﬁbers directly from as-grown CNT
materials seems to be a more convenient way. A breakthrough was made by Jiang
et al. [75] in 2002 when a neat CNT yarn could be simply drawn from a vertically
superaligned CNT array. The CNTs could be self-assembled into yarns of up to 30 cm
in length. Subsequently, Zhang et al. [76] produced highly orientated free-standing
CNT transparent sheets using a similar method and further assembled CNTs into
ﬁbers by using a draw-twisting spin method [77]. The typical SEM images of the ﬁber
spinning processes are shown in Fig. 8.6. Many applications of these ﬁbers were
proposed and demonstrated [78–82], and different postspinning methods were
developed to improve their performances. Jiang et al. [75] found that the strength and
conductivity of their yarns could be improved after heating at high temperatures.
By introducing twist during spinning, multiple torque-stabilized yarns could be
obtained by Zhang et al. [77] who achieved yarn strengths greater than 460 MPa.
They emphasized that the load could be transferred effectively between CNTs
because of the twisting. In a twisted ﬁber, individual CNTs are inclined at an angle ɑ
with respect to the ﬁber axis, generating transverse forces, which lock the ﬁbers
together as a coherent structure. They also found that these twisted yarns deformed
292
8

hysterically over large strain ranges from 0.5 to 8 %, providing up to 48 % energy
damping. These yarns could also retain their strength and ﬂexibility even after being
heated in air at 450 °C for an hour or being immersed in liquid nitrogen. In addition to
using postspinning methods, Zhang et al. [83–85] observed that mechanical prop-
erties could be signiﬁcantly improved by using longer CNT arrays. The tensile
strength and stiffness of their ﬁbers spun from a 1-mm-long CNT array were mea-
sured to be in the range 1.35–3.3 and 100–263 GPa, respectively. These values are
many times higher per weight than the values shown by the best existing engineering
ﬁbers and CNT ﬁbers reported previously. It is clear that the strength of the CNT
ﬁbers increased with increase in the CNT array length, which yields a much larger
friction between CNTs. In the case of longer CNTs, there are fewer mechanical
defects (like the ends of CNTs) per unit ﬁber length [86–89]. Other factors such as
structure, purity, density, alignment, and straightness of CNTs [90] have all been
investigated. For instance, to obtain densely packed CNT ﬁbers, surface tension-
driven densiﬁcation [91, 92] was employed during ﬁber spinning. Zhang et al. found
that after the CNT yarn was pulled through droplets of ethanol, the several centimeter-
wide yarn shrank into a tight ﬁber, typically 20–30 µm in diameter, and the strength of
the CNT yarn dramatically improved. The CNT alignment was found to be crucial for
ﬁber properties [93, 94] and could be measured by Raman and X-ray diffraction
(XRD) [95, 96]. Zheng et al. [97] observed a strong correlation between the array
morphologies (the straightness of CNTs) and the ﬁber properties and well-aligned
arrays yielded high performance, while wavy arrays led to poor performance.
Because CNTs in a yarn are nearly parallel aligned, the CNT yarn is intrinsically
an anisotropic material and has a special axis along the drawing direction, which
demonstrates many fascinating properties and applications. However, some key
issues need to be solved in advance to realize their practical applications. Currently,
the growth of CNT arrays is easy, but not all CNT arrays could be spun into yarns
or ﬁbers. Zhang et al. found that strong van der Waals interactions exist between
individual CNTs within superaligned arrays, and this van der Waals force makes
the CNTs join end to end, resulting in the formation of a continuous yarn during
pulling. Meanwhile, Zhang et al. claimed that the formation of yarn was due to the
disordered regions at the top and bottom of the CNT arrays, which entangled
together to form a loop. Further investigation is required to understand the
underlying spinning mechanism [98].
8.3 Functional Carbon Fibers for Smart Composites
8.3.1 Metal-Coated Carbon Fibers and Their Applications
Traditionally, carbon ﬁbers were used as good reinforcements for metals [99],
ceramics [100], and polymers [101]. To increase the physical properties of carbon
ﬁber-reinforced metal (CFRM), carbon ﬁber-reinforced ceramic (CFRC), and
8.2

carbon ﬁber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) matrix composites, various surface treat-
ments such as thermal oxidation, electric oxidation, ozone treatments, plasma
treatments, and even metal coating were developed [102–110]. Among these,
metal-coating methods lead to very interesting interfacial and electrical properties
between carbon ﬁbers and matrices. The adhesion of metal/carbon ﬁber composites
has been shown to be excellent when the metal coating is grown from the carbon
ﬁber surfaces. In particular, polymer/metal interaction is strong, mainly because of
the high metal surface energetics, which allows extensive wetting with the polymer.
According to Park’s report [111], metal deposition on carbon ﬁbers can lead to
high surface free energy, resulting in good mechanical and interfacial properties of
CFRPs. Figure 8.18 shows the surface free energy of Ni-plated carbon ﬁbers [111].
The Ni plating on carbon ﬁber surfaces at a current density range 5–60 A/m2 leads
to better wetting levels than that of untreated carbon ﬁbers. To improve the wet-
tability, the surface free energy of the treated carbon ﬁbers needs to be made larger
than that of the matrix in a real composite system. When a current density of 10 A/
m2 was used, the surface free energy, γS, reached the highest value of approxi-
mately 67 mJ/m2. Thus, it is expected that the degree of adhesion between met-
allized carbon ﬁber surfaces and epoxy resin can be enhanced, because the surface
free energy of the metallized carbon ﬁbers does allow extensive wetting with the
epoxy resin (45 mJ/m2).
It is well known that the resulting mechanical properties of the composites
strongly depend on the ﬁber–matrix interfacial adhesion, which affects the ease of
load transfer from one matrix to the other via the ﬁbers. Figure 8.19 shows the
interlaminar shear stress (ILSS) of the Ni-plated CFRPs as a function of the current
density. All metallized CFRPs showed higher ILSS values than those of the
untreated CFRPs. Further, the maximum strength was observed at a current density
of 10 A/m2 [111].

8.3.2 Electroless Metal Coating for Electric Devices
All electric devices and systems such as television transmitters, police radios, and
cellular phones can cause electromagnetic interference (EMI) because of the fre-
quencies of their switching rates [112]. It is a well-known fact that EMI can cause
monitors and other medical devices such as pacemakers to malfunction. To shield
EMI, traditionally, the use of antistatic or electric materials has been strongly
pursued [113]. In practical application, some composite materials, which have
ﬁllers with low electric resistance, can partially shield EMI in the case of electric
devices. This is the reason for the extensive efforts of many researchers toward the
development of highly conductive ﬁbers or powders [114, 115].
Composites reinforced by conductive ﬁllers can be actively applied in PTC
materials, stealth aircrafts, sensors, and other many electric devices. The method to
reduce the electric resistance of conductive ﬁllers at room temperature is regarded
as one of the key technologies in the composites.
Carbon ﬁbers are widely used as reinforcements in polymer matrix composites.
Because of good mechanical properties and the wide areas in which the carbon
ﬁber-reinforced composites can be applied, carbon ﬁbers are still attractive mate-
rials to researchers. If carbon ﬁbers have a very high electric conductivity, the
application of carbon ﬁbers is bound to increase. Highly conductive carbon ﬁber-
reinforced composites can be easily applied in EMI shielding or stealth materials.
To decrease the speciﬁc electric resistivity of carbon ﬁbers, various metal plating
techniques have been applied using Ni, Cu, Zn, Pt, and Ag [116–121]. Among
these techniques, electroless Ni plating is a viable method to produce low resistive
ﬁllers for EMI shielding. Electroless Ni plating offers advantages of good metal
deposition, very low electric resistivity and shielding effectiveness, and applica-
bility to nonconducting materials with complicated shapes [122, 123].

The nickel plating process is based on a redox reaction in which the reducing
agent is oxidized and Ni2+ ions are reduced on the substrate surface. When the ﬁrst
layer of nickel is deposited, it serves as a catalyst for the process. As a result, a
linear relationship between the coating thickness and time normally occurs. During
electroless plating, carbon ﬁber surfaces are metalized when exposed to plating
solutions, coating molten salt in the presence of a reductant.
Electroless Ni plating, in contrast to nickel electroplating, does not require an
external electric current to produce a deposit. Deposition occurs in an aqueous
solution containing metal ions, a reducing agent, and catalysts. Chemical reactions
on the surface of the catalytic part being plated lead to deposition of the metal or
alloy. The most common reducing agent used (also used here) is sodium hypo-
phosphite, which leads to two types of simultaneous reactions.
The ﬁrst reaction involves the cathodic reaction of Ni2+, H+, and H2PO2
−or the
deposition of Ni–P alloy and the production of hydrogen.

The Ni2+ ions adsorbed in the presence of the activated ﬁber surfaces are reduced
by the adsorbed H+ ions, and the plating proceeds as long as there is sufﬁcient
availability of metal ions and reducing agent. The reduction of nickel is conﬁrmed
by the formation of hydrogen from the ﬁber surfaces. In this case, a very vigorous
reaction is observed during the plating initially.
Figure 8.20 shows the SEM micrographs of the Ni/carbon ﬁbers as a function of
plating time. Figure 8.20a, b, c shows the side view of the as-received and carbon
ﬁbers plated with Ni for 5 and 10 min, respectively. Figure 8.20d, e shows the
cross-sectional images of the ﬁbers plated for 10 and 30 min. The as-received
carbon ﬁbers (a) showed a smooth surface and uniform diameters. In case of the
sample plated for 5 min (b), Ni particles were deposited irregularly. Perfect Ni
layers were coated on carbon ﬁbers in the sample shown in Fig. 8.20c, and the
thickness of the Ni layer increased in the sample shown in (e) in comparison with
the sample shown in (d). These results are in good agreement with the data shown
in Fig. 8.20. In Fig. 8.20, the Ni content rapidly increased up to 10 min and then
gently increased to 30 min. Abraham et al. [124] reported that metal plating on
carbon ﬁbers began at scratches and ﬁne cracks existed on the surface of carbon
ﬁbers were connected to each other. Ni plating in this system is understandable
through a similar mechanism of Ni loading, which can be applied on carbon ﬁbers.
In the sample plated for 5 min, an island-like Ni layer was observed, as shown
296
8
Carbon Fibers and Their Composites

Fig. 8.20b. On the other hand, in the sample plated for 10 min (c), a very smooth
surface similar to that observed in the case of the as-received samples was observed.
This result indicates that the island-like Ni clusters merged together and formed a
layer. In the sample plated for 30 min (e), the diameter of the ﬁbers is approxi-
mately 6–7 µm and the thickness of the nickel layer is 2–3 µm. As a result, perfect
Ni layers formed and fully covered the carbon ﬁber surfaces.
Wide-scan spectra in the binding energy range 0–1,200 eV were obtained to
identify the surface elements present and to conduct a quantitative analysis. The
XPS wide-scan spectra of the two carbon ﬁber samples (as-received and samples
plated for 30 min) are shown in Fig. 8.21. The spectra distinctly show the carbon,

oxygen, and nickel peaks of the samples. The peak intensity of the O1s
(BE = 532.8 eV) and the Ni2p (BE = 857.6 eV) peaks of the Ni-plated carbon ﬁbers
was higher than that of the as-received carbon ﬁbers. The enhancement of the O1s
peaks on the carbon ﬁber surface can be explained on the basis that severe plating
conditions such as high pH and temperature may affect the surface structures and
chemical compositions, resulting in an introduction of oxygen-containing groups on
the carbon surfaces. Figure 8.22 shows the expanded scale of the O1s XPS proﬁles
of the (a) as-received and (b) electroless Ni-plated carbon ﬁbers after 30 min of
plating. The O1s proﬁle of the as-received sample reveals the presence of two peaks.
Peak 1 (binding energy, BE = 530.6 eV) corresponds to the C=O group (ketone,
lactone, and carbonyl) or the –OH group, and peak 2 (BE = 532.6 eV) corresponds
to the O–C–O group. The spectra of the Ni-plated carbon ﬁbers reveal the presence
of three peaks corresponding to the NiO group (BE = 527.8 eV), C=O or –OH
groups (BE = 531.6 eV), and O–C–O groups (BE = 532.6 eV). The center of the
C=O or –OH peak was shifted to the high BE region after Ni plating [124].
This indicates that the BE between elements oxygen and carbon is enhanced
because of the introduction of Ni particles on the carbon surfaces. As is shown in
Fig. 8.22b, the NiO peak was newly formed and it can be understood that the source
of elemental oxygen is the O–C–O, C=O, or –OH of the as-received carbon ﬁbers.
From Fig. 8.22, the O–C–O peak decreased in intensity and the C=O or –OH peak
was enhanced after the Ni plating. Hence, it can be concluded that the introduction
of Ni particles helps the formation of C=O or NiO by reducing O–C–O. In addition,
some of the C=O also contributes to the formation of NiO, resulting in an increase
in the binding energy of the C=O peaks. The experimental XPS results show that
the carbon content of the Ni-plated ﬁbers decreased when they were plated with
nickel, whereas the oxygen and nickel contents of the plated ﬁbers were higher in
comparison with those of the as-received ﬁbers. These active groups on the carbon
ﬁber surfaces produced through nickel plating may help change the polarity and the
functionality of the ﬁber surfaces [124].

Figure 8.23 shows the speciﬁc electric resistivity of the electroless Ni-plated
carbon ﬁbers as a function of the plating time. The electrical conductivity increased
proportionally with the Ni-electroplating time. It was also found that the speciﬁc
electric resistivity was signiﬁcantly reduced after 10 min of plating, after which no
additional decrease occurred up to 30 min of plating. This can be ascribed to the
formation of perfect Ni layers on the carbon ﬁbers after a speciﬁc point of the
process.
Normally, electroless plating is achieved through three steps: (1) the introduction
of nuclei, (2) the formation of metallic islands (or particles), and (3) the formation
of perfect layers. In Fig. 8.23, the speciﬁc resistance of the sample subjected to
plating for 1 min was decreased in comparison with the value shown by the as-
received sample, indicating that the electric network on the ﬁber surfaces was
highly enhanced in the sample plated for 1 min. It can be understood that the island-
like Ni loading in the sample plated for 1 min strongly leads to a reduction in the
electric resistivity of the carbon ﬁbers, though the metallic layer on the ﬁber sur-
faces has not yet formed.
From the results, it is concluded that the electric resistivity can be controlled by
electroless Ni plating when a perfect layer is formed. Excessive plating conditions
make the microstructure of the Ni layers and the crystal sizes of the nickel particles
dense and small, resulting in superlow speciﬁc electric resistivity and saturation
state.
8.3.3 Electrolytic Metal Coating for Electric Devices
All carbon ﬁbers must be pretreated before metal coating to remove the polymeric
sizing materials. The electric resistance of the heat-treated carbon ﬁbers (350 °C,
10 min) and the chemically treated ﬁbers (acetone, 30 min) is 0.75 × 10−3 and
0.81 × 10−3 Ω cm, respectively, while the value shown by the as-received carbon

function of Ni-plating time
[124]
8.3

ﬁbers is 0.94 × 10−3 Ω cm. Heat treatment was more effective for removing sizing
polymers than the chemical treatment. However, the heat treatment caused many
partial defects in the carbon ﬁbers because of the occurrence of burning. In con-
clusion, to avoid defects in carbon ﬁbers, we chose the chemical method as a
pretreatment even though the electric resistivity was slightly higher than that of
carbon ﬁbers subjected to heat treatment.
As shown in Fig. 8.24, the nickel particles grew gradually and formed a metallic
layer on the ﬁber surface. Nickel particles formed a perfect nickel layer after 10 s of
plating, and then, the thickness of the nickel layers increased with increase in the
plating time. From the SEM analyses, a mechanism of formation of nickel-coated
carbon ﬁbers can be proposed. Normally, there are many gaps or cracks on the top

surface of the as-received carbon ﬁbers. In the initial state of plating, ﬁne nickel
particles are introduced at these points, which form an island-like state, which
constitutes the ﬁlling step. These metal particles combine and become big clusters
during the “large-cluster formation” step. Each cluster grows, and the clusters meet
each other and form a metallic layer, during the layer formation step. Then, the
thickness of the nickel layer grows with plating time, which is called the thick
coating step. In this study, the large-cluster formation and layer formation steps
were observed at 10–30 s of plating (Fig. 8.25) [125].
XRD analysis was employed to observe the microstructures of the nickel/carbon
hybrid ﬁbers, and the results are shown in Fig. 8.26. The characteristic peaks of
nickel, such as Ni(111) at 44° (2θ), Ni(200) at 52° (2θ), and Ni(220) at 76° (θ),
were found in all the Ni-plated carbon ﬁbers. It was also found that all the Ni peaks
increased in intensity with increase in plating time. In case of C(002) at 25° (2θ),
the characteristic peak signiﬁcantly decreased in intensity with increase in plating
time, indicating that metallic Ni formed perfect layers and covered the outer surface
of carbon ﬁbers. Figure 8.26b, c, d shows the magniﬁed peaks of Ni(111), Ni(200),
and Ni(220), respectively. It is interesting to note that each characteristic peak was
shifted to the right side with increasing plating time, indicating that the high amount
of nickel loading affected the microstructures of the nickel layers.
In the case of Ni(111), the peak position altered from 44.39° to 44.50°. Nor-
mally, the peak position in a material indicates the distance between standard
crystals, and the change in the peak position indicates a change in the distance
between the crystals, resulting in a change in the material density. In all the Ni
peaks, the peak position shifted to a high value, indicating that the distance between
the crystals became narrow, and the nickel layer formed on the ﬁbers became dense.

The nickel layer is composed of nickel particles. Hence, the gaps between the
nickel particles are present. The results of the XRD analysis prove the occurrence of
changes in the packing density with plating time. The average particle size
decreased with increase in plating time, resulting in the enhancement of electric
conductivity of the ﬁbers. Figure 8.27 is a schematic of the nickel particle depo-
sition behaviors on carbon ﬁbers. The change in the particle size and packing

density can indicate a decrease of inner pores, which results in the reduction of
contact loss between nickel particles.
Figure 8.28 shows the electric resistance of the nickel-coated carbon ﬁbers. The
speciﬁc resistance decreased with increase in plating time. Also, the speciﬁc
resistivity of the as-received sample exceeded 0.80 × 10−3 Ω cm, although this
value decreased dramatically with increase in plating time up to 60 s. From the
good linearity of results in the range 5–30 s, a strong correlation was observed
between the electrical conductivity and plating time. In the case of samples sub-
jected to plating for more than 60 s, the conductivity did not signiﬁcantly enhance.
Hence, a perfect Ni layer can be formed in the range 30–60 s, resulting in the
saturation of electrical conductivity due to the minimization of inner pores (or
contact loss between nickel particles) [125].
8.3.4 Nanocarbon Coating on Carbon Fibers
Recently, carbon/carbon composites (CCCs) have stimulated intense scientiﬁc
research on account of their exceptional physical and chemical properties such as
excellent high-temperature resistance, mechanical properties, durability, and elec-
trical conductivity [126–138]. Examples of CCCs include carbon nanoﬁbers/acti-
vated carbon ﬁbers (CNFs/ACFs), carbon nanotubes/carbon ﬁbers (CNTs/CFs),
carbon nanotubes/carbon black (CNTs/CB), carbon nanotubes/carbon papers
(CNTs/CPs), and graphene/CNTs [134–138]. These CCCs have been used in a
wide range of applications, i.e., in polymer composites, in electromagnetic inter-
ference shielding materials, in electrode materials, and in thermal conductivity
materials.
The growth of CNTs or CNFs on the surface of CFs has speciﬁcally attracted
enormous attention as model systems for nanoscience and nanotechnology

[131–147]. CNTs or CNFs are a highly important class of carbon materials with
novel properties, particularly high aspect ratios, small radius of curvature, high
mechanical strength, unique electrical properties, and chemical stability [148, 149].
By far, some studies have been reported about the growth of CNFs on the surface of
CFs. Kim et al. [142] reported a simple method for the preparation of ACFs coated
with graphite nanoﬁbers to enhance the electrical conductivity of ACFs. Because of
the unique electrical properties of the CNFs, the volume resistivity of CNF-coated
ACFs was twofold greater than pristine ACFs. Mathur et al. [143] reported that the
mechanical properties of CNT/CF–resin composites increase with the increase in
the amount of deposited CNTs. Hsieh et al. [147] fabricated superhydrophobic
carbon fabric with micro/nanoscaled two-tier roughness by decorating CNTs onto
microsized CFs, using catalytic chemical vapor deposition and a subsequent ﬂuo-
rination surface treatment.
While the growth of CNTs or CNFs on the CF substrate can further improve the
properties of the CFs, there are some challenges encountered in the synthesis of
CNFs or CNTs on the CF substrates by catalytic chemical vapor deposition
(CCVD). For example, the metal catalysts (e.g., Ni, Fe, and Co) easily aggregate
into large particles and form mixed phases of carbon materials (CNFs, CNTs, and
amorphous carbon), and the formation of CNTs or CNFs is not uniform on the CFs,
requiring puriﬁcation processes. Previous researches have reported that the particle
size of the catalyst is the factor determining the diameter of the CNFs grown on the
substrates and the key is to control the morphology of the obtained nanoparticles
[150–153].
To synthesize CNFs with a given diameter, it is necessary to stabilize their sizes
on the supporting substrates. Therefore, the preparation of catalyst nanoparticles has
played an important role in the growth of CNFs on the CF substrate. Several
catalyst preparation methods have been reported in the literature [139, 141, 152].
Sun et al. reported the growth of CNTs on carbon paper by ohmically heating
silane-dispersed catalytic sites [152]. This method helped to prevent catalyst pre-
cursors from diffusing into the carbon matrix and allowed them to play a similar
role of the catalysts used in the growth of CNTs on the CFs. As many research
studies have reported, ordered mesoporous silica materials are excellent catalyst
supports and have been used in the growth of carbon nanomaterials [153–155].
Zheng et al. reported that mesoporous silica ﬁlms can direct the growth of well-
aligned CNTs perpendicular to parallel to the substrate surface through the control
of the distribution of catalysts [155]. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to use
different methods of uniformly dispersing Ni catalysts on the CF substrate so that
dense carbon nanomaterials can grow on the CF surfaces. Thermal CVD was used
for the subsequent growth of carbon nanomaterials.
1. Preparation of nanocarbon coated on CFs
In order to prepare nanocarbon-coated CFs, three steps are required, which
include (1) surface treatments of CFs, (2) catalyst coating on CFs, and (3) direct
nanocarbon synthesis on CFs. CFs (Tairyﬁl, TC36-3 K) used in our experiments
304

Carbon Fibers and Their Composites

consist of ﬁlaments with a diameter of 3–7 lm. Before being used, the CFs were
desized by ultrasonically cleaning in acetone and ethanol and drying at room
temperature. Then, the CFs were subjected to thermal debinding at 723 K for
30 min in air to burn the organic binder. Finally, they were immersed in a
methyl ethyl ketone solution (butanone) to dissolve the burnt carbon and clean
the CF surfaces. The desized CFs are immersed in a solution of HNO3/H2SO4
(with a volume ratio of 1:3) for 12 h at room temperature and then washed with
water to obtain a pH level of 7 [156].
The Ni-containing catalysts supported on CFs were prepared via three methods.
In the ﬁrst method, the acid-treated CFs were impregnated with a 5 wt% nickel
nitrate solution and dried in air. The CF samples collected before the CNFs were
grown on the CF surfaces are designated as CF-1, while the CF samples collected
after the CNFs were grown on the CF surfaces are designated as CF-1-CNF.
In the second method, the acid-treated CFs were impregnated with mesoporous
silica sol and dried at 353 K. Mesoporous silica precursor solutions were prepared
by mixing tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, Aldrich), surfactant (Pluronic P123,
EO20PO70EO20, Mav = 5800, Aldrich), distilled water, ethyl alcohol, and
hydrochloride at a molar ratio of 1:0.0103:9.36:21.4:0.04. The CFs were then
calcined at 723 K for 2 h. Finally, the CFs coated with mesoporous silica ﬁlm were
impregnated with a 5 wt% nickel nitrate solution for 12 h and dried in air. The
samples collected before the CNFs were grown on the CF surfaces are designated
CF-2, while the CF samples collected after the CNFs were grown on the CF
surfaces are designated as CF-2-CNF.
In the third method, the acid-treated CFs were impregnated with a Ni-doped
mesoporous silica precursor solution. The solution was prepared by mixing TEOS,
P123, distilled water, ethyl alcohol, hydrochloride, and nickel nitrate in a molar
ratio of 1:0.0103:9.36:21.4:0.04:0.47. The CFs were then calcined at 723 K for 2 h.
The samples collected before the CNFs were grown on the CF surfaces are des-
ignated as CF-3, while the CF samples collected after the CNFs were grown on the
CF surfaces are designated as CF-3-CNF.
The CFs were placed in an alumina boat located in the middle of a ﬂow through
a tube furnace and heated to a certain temperature (1,023 K) in 200 ccm of ﬂowing
Ar. At the same temperature, they were then subjected to a reduced ﬂow of 5 % H2/
Ar (150 ccm) for 30 min to obtain the reduced Ni nanoparticles. Acetylene (30 ccm)
was then introduced into the furnace for 30 min to help the CNFs grow on the
surface of the CFs. Figure 8.29 illustrates the process of growth of CNFs on the
surface of the CFs the three methods.
2. Characteristics of nanocarbon coated on CFs
Figure 8.30 shows the SEM images of CFs treated with the three methods. As
shown in Fig. 8.30a, the surface of the CF is very smooth. However, after the
CFs are immersed in a solution of Ni(NO3)2, the surfaces of the CFs contain Ni
(NO3)2 particles with sizes ranging from approximately 10 to 100 nm
8.3
Functional Carbon Fibers for Smart Composites
305

(Fig. 8.30b). As shown in Fig. 8.30c, some Ni(NO3)2 particles with different
sizes are adsorbed on the CF surfaces coated with the mesoporous silica ﬁlm;
the particles are bigger because some of the Ni(NO3)2 particles are supple-
mented in the mesoporous silica layer. In Fig. 8.30d, the CF surfaces are coated
with a smooth Ni-doped mesoporous silica thin ﬁlm. It can be seen that the
surface of CF-3 is covered by a smooth thin ﬁlm, which can be attributed to the
catalysts incorporated into mesopores with a molecularly well-deﬁned structure
[155, 157]. The successful coating of this ﬁlm on the CF surfaces can directly
facilitate the uniformity and density of the CNFs that grow on the CFs through
strong interactions with the Ni catalyst [158–160]. A comparison of the CNFs
grown on the CF surfaces via the various methods leads to the conclusion that
the content and size of Ni particles distributed on the CF surfaces can be
correlated with the density and structure of the CNFs [150].
To understand how the CF pretreatment affects the growth of CNFs, we used
SEM to analyze the morphology and microstructure of the obtained CNFs. For the
growth of CNFs, the CFs were ﬁrst reduced by hydrogen gas. Because of the
growth of carbon materials on the CFs without hydrogen, Ni(NO3)2 did not play the
role of catalyst [147, 160]. Figure 8.31 shows the SEM images of CNFs grown on
the CF surfaces with various types of pretreatment. As shown in Fig. 8.31a, b, the
heterogeneous anchoring of CNFs on the CF-1 surfaces produces CFs with a
thickness of 10 lm and a diameter in the range 60–120 nm. This outcome can be
attributed to a weak interaction of the active components with the CFs, in which
case the Ni particles easily aggregate to bulk particles on the CF surface. In
Fig. 8.31c, d, the growth of the CNFs on the CF surfaces is nonuniform. The
diameters and thicknesses of the CNFs are in the range 20–200 nm and 12–20 µm
Fig. 8.29 Preparation process of CFs coated with CNFs by various methods [133]

because the active component of Ni particles is more uniformly distributed in the
mesopores and the mesopores limit the catalysts from aggregating into a bulk
particle [24]. As shown in Fig. 8.31e, f, after the Ni-doped mesoporous silica thin
ﬁlms have been wash-coated, the CF surfaces are covered entirely by the uniform
growth of CNFs with a thickness of up to 52.5 µm. The diameters of the CNFs are
in the range 20–50 nm. The formation of straight CNFs may be related to the pore
structure of the mesoporous silica. Because the Ni nanoparticles are distributed in
the mesopores structures, the Ni catalyst incites the growth of the CNFs on the top
of the CF surfaces coated with mesoporous silica ﬁlms. Hence, the content and size
of Ni particles adsorbed on the CF surfaces are correlated with the density of CNFs,
and Ni nanoparticles are well dispersed within the pore channels of the mesoporous
silica ﬁlm for the growth of CNFs.
The morphology of the CNFs was also analyzed using TEM and is shown in
Fig. 8.32. Figure 8.32a, b shows the entangled bundles of CNFs with different sizes.
Impurities such as carbon nanotubes, CNFs, amorphous carbon, and Ni particles are
present in the sample. The grown CNFs show a range of diameters (20–400 nm). In
Fig. 8.32c, d, the grown CNFs are more uniform and have a herringbone-type
alignment in which the graphene planes are at an angle to the ﬁber axis [161, 162].
Our results conﬁrm that the structure of the CNFs can be correlated with the Ni
catalyst size, and the results also conﬁrm that interactions of the CNFs with the CFs

and the mesoporous silica ﬁlms are an excellent catalyst support for the growth of
CNFs on CF surfaces.
N2/77 K isotherms were used to measure the pore structures of the pristine CFs,
CFs coated with Ni-doped mesoporous TiO2 ﬁlm, CF–GNF, and CF–GNF–FP, as
shown in Fig. 8.33. It was found that CF–GNF shows a typical type IV isotherm.
There is a measurable increase in the speciﬁc surface area and the total pore volume
of CF–Ti because the mesoporous TiO2 ﬁlm is calcined at 723 K in air to remove
any surfactant (Pluronic P123), and this process produces a mesoscopically porous
layer. It is noteworthy that the Ni particles are uniformly dispersed in the TiO2
framework in the case of CF–Ti [160].

The speciﬁc surface area and total pore volume of CF–GNF are 248 m2/g and
0.293 cm3/g, respectively. The result demonstrates that the Ni-doped mesoporous
TiO2 ﬁlm leads to the growth of 3D GNF network on the CF surfaces. It also shows
that the adsorbed N2 volume of CF–GNF–FP is less than that of CF–GNF. The

decrease in the adsorbed volume for the GNF-coated CFs was approximately 32 %.
The surface area and total pore volume of the CF–GNF–FP are 169 m2/g and
0.240 cm3/g, respectively. This indicates that the ﬂuoropolymer coating did not
seriously diminish the pore structures of CF–GNF.
The surface morphology of the CF surfaces was examined by SEM. Fig-
ure 8.34a, c shows the diameter of a single ﬁlament of CFs measured from this
micrograph, and the ﬁlament diameter is 6 µm. As shown in Fig. 8.34d, the CF
surfaces are coated with a smooth Ni-doped mesoporous TiO2 thin ﬁlm. The suc-
cessful coating of this ﬁlm on the CF surfaces can directly facilitate the uniformity
and density of the GNFs grown on the CFs through strong interactions with the Ni
catalysts [133]. After catalytic C2H2 decomposition at lower temperature, the CF
surfaces are covered entirely by the uniform growth of GNFs with a thickness of up
to 15.4 µm, as shown in Fig. 8.34e–h. Figure 8.34e, f shows entangled bundles of
GNFs, and the diameters of the GNFs range from 60 to 80 nm. The morphologies
of the grown GNFs have also been analyzed using TEM and are shown in
Fig. 8.34i, j. The GNFs are uniform and show a herringbone-type alignment in
which the graphene planes are at an angle to the ﬁber axis [148].
Figure 8.35 shows the changes in the contact angle (CA) and the surface
properties of the CFs. As shown in this Fig. 8.35, without any treatment, the water
droplet retains an ellipsoidal shape on the CFs, with a CA of 27.2°, suggesting that
the raw CF surfaces exhibit a hydrophilic character. Interestingly, the water drop
rapidly passes through the CFs and then completely wets the CFs, as illustrated in
Fig. 8.35a. The CA of CF–FP increases to 121.5° after being coated with a ﬂu-
oropolymer because of the hydrophobic CF3 groups, which mimic the wax epi-
cuticular on the surface of a lotus leaf to decrease the surface free energy
(Fig. 8.35b). Previous studies have reported that F-coated CF surfaces are hydro-
phobic (CA > 90°) [167]. The sharp increase of the CA from 27.2° to 145.3° in the
case of CF–GNF (Fig. 8.35c) originates from the 3D GNF networks. As many
works have revealed, surface roughness plays an important role in determining the
wetting behavior of solid surfaces [133, 163, 164]. Generally, ﬂuorinated com-
pounds and silanes are typically low surface energy compounds and can endow
various substrates with high hydrophobicity [165, 166]. In accordance with this, the
CA of CF–GNF–FP after treatment with ﬂuoropolymer increases to 153.5°, and the
surface shows superhydrophobicity (Fig. 8.35). The falling water droplet could
bounce up from the CF–GNF–FP surfaces, indicating the low contact angle hys-
teresis. The superhydrophobic CF–GNF–FP surface is believed to be caused by the
presence of synergistic binary geometric roughness at the micro/nanometer scale
and the low surface energy functional groups, which reduce the surface energy.
The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatical charge/discharge test in a KOH
electrolyte is considered as a suitable tool for estimating the electrochemical
properties of CFs before and after the chemical treatment. Figure 8.36a shows the
cyclic voltammetry curves of pristine CFs and CFs coated with GNFs at a voltage
scan rate of 20 mV/s. It shows the voltammetry proﬁles of all the carbon samples.
CF–GNF and CF–GNF–FP show marked deviation from the ideal rectangular
shape, which is typical and is ascribed to the formation of many micro- or

mesopores. The GNFs show the graphite-like structure, in which the stacking of
nanosized graphene is quite uniform along the whole ﬁber axis [163]. An evident
increase in the current density of CF–GNF composites is clearly observed because
of the higher speciﬁc surface area and higher electrical conductivity enhanced by
the growth of GNFs [165]. The galvanostatical charge/discharge curves of CFs and
CFs coated with GNFs tested at a current of 2 A/g are also shown in Fig. 8.36b. It
can be seen that the charge/discharge curves of CFs were very symmetrical and
triangular. After the growth of GNFs on the CF surfaces, the times required for both
charge/discharge processes are longer than those observed for pristine CFs. The
speciﬁc capacitance of CF–GNF composites was 19 F/g, which is more than that of
the pristine CFs (2 F/g) and CF–GNF–FP (15 F/g). After chemical treatment with a
ﬂuoropolymer, the speciﬁc capacitance of CF–GNF–FP is lower than that of
CF–GNF because of the lower speciﬁc surface area and higher ionic transfer
resistance. The results indicate that the more nanoporous structure of GNFs can
effectively reduce the diffusion length and the diffusion time of ions and thus lead to
rapid charge–discharge characteristics at the same scanning rate.
The future of carbon ﬁbers is bright. Traditionally, the application of carbon
ﬁbers has been limited to very special ﬁelds such as aerospace and military because
of their high cost. However, various techniques for low-cost carbon ﬁbers are under
development in terms of using low-cost precursors, low-cost manufacturing pro-
cesses, and even functional coating methods. Moreover, future applications of
carbon ﬁbers can widen not only as structural reinforcements but also in infor-
mation technology-based applications such as housings for electric devices, smart
cloths, and healthcare items. In particular, EMI shielding can be a new ﬁeld because
EMI shielding materials normally need high mechanical strength, good electric
conductivity, and good EMI absorbability. In this respect, carbon ﬁbers coated with
functional materials can be optimal materials.

However, the bottleneck inhibiting the real application of carbon ﬁbers is its
price. The price of carbon ﬁbers is approximately $25–80/kg. For automobile
applications, the price of carbon ﬁbers must be under $15/kg. The price in the case
of application in electric devices must be under $30/kg.
Hence, continued research on carbon ﬁbers is necessary to achieve the goal of
producing low-cost and highly functional future carbon ﬁbers.
