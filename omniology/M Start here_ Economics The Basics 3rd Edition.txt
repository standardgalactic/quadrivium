ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Michael Mandel
Michael Mandel delights in translating complex eco-
nomic concepts into understandable, relevant, and excit-
ing examples for a broad audience. He received his PhD 
in economics from Harvard University, where he studied 
the intricacies of game theory. He is currently Senior Fellow at the Mack Institute for 
Innovation Management at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, as 
well as Chief Economic Strategist at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington, DC. 
He regularly testifies before Congress and writes about the policy implications of 
­innovation, regulation, and growth, both domestically and internationally.
Previously, Mandel was Chief Economist of BusinessWeek (now Bloomberg Business-
week), where he regularly tackled such hot topics as the economics of immigration, 
the power of technological innovation to drive growth, the importance of foreign 
trade, and consequences of tax policy.
Mandel’s columns and cover stories have won numerous awards, including the Excel-
lence in Economic Journalism Award from the Institute on Political Journalism, given 
to the writer “who has done the most to shape public opinion by giving the public a 
better understanding of economic theory and reality”; the Gerald Loeb Award, the 
most prestigious prize for economic and financial journalism; and the Economic Jour-
nalist of the Year Award from the World Leadership Forum. He was also named one of 
the top 100 business journalists of the 20th century.
Mandel is the author of several books, including Rational Exuberance: Silencing the 
Enemies of Growth and Why the Future Is Better Than You Think and The High-Risk 
Society. He also helped revise the 1995 edition of Paul Samuelson’s classic econom-
ics textbook.
His economics news blog, designed especially for intro-level economics students, 
can be found at economicsthebasics.com. Mandel lives in Washington, DC, not far 
from the White House and the Capitol.

PREFACE
When I started developing the first edition of this textbook, I had two goals. First, I 
wanted to clearly explain basic economic principles, using the tools that I learned 
during my years as an economist and as an economic journalist. Second, I aimed to 
provide an introduction to the forces of globalization, technology, and financial mar-
kets that are driving the vibrant, but increasingly perplexing economy that we all 
live in.
	 This edition adds an additional goal—to help provide an economic context for the 
Great Recession and the recovery that followed. This event, or rather series of 
events, has had an enormous impact on everyone. 
	 What you see here is the result of my effort to achieve these three goals. The first 
half of the textbook, which includes the introduction and 11 core chapters, pres-
ents the essential economic concepts. I designed this section to be accessible to 
people with a wide range of economic and mathematical backgrounds. The second 
half of the textbook covers topics such as financial markets, globalization, techno-
logical change, health care, and environmental economics.
	 In this edition, I consistently use fresh examples from today’s global economy. 
The textbook is intended to provide a window into what is happening in the econ-
omy right now, including globalization, innovation, and the aftermath of the finan-
cial crisis.
Fundamental Goals
To summarize, I want to accomplish three goals with this textbook:
• To help you acquire the basic tools of economics, enabling you to understand 
today’s world in a new way. 
• To give you better insights into the forces of globalization, technology, and 
­financial markets that are so important for today and our future.
• To provide an economic context for the Great Recession, and how it affected 
the economy for years afterward.
Distinguishing Features and Organization
This textbook emphasizes the main forces shaping today’s economy: technological 
change, globalization, and the evolution of financial markets. The basic tools of 
economics are presented in the first 12 chapters to lay a foundation for under-
standing how the economy evolves and changes.

Preface
Current and Real Examples  Economic concepts and ideas are illustrated in re-
cent newsworthy events to help you see that economics is in action everywhere 
around you. Each chapter starts with a brief vignette that applies the concept to be 
learned to real-world events so you can see how the chapter concept relates back 
to everyday life.
Clear and Simple Graphs  This book’s simple, easy-to-follow graphs translate 
complex economic concepts into effective visual tools for the beginning student.
Historical Context  Economic Milestone boxes sprinkled throughout each chapter 
provide interesting historical facts and references that relate to the material at hand.
Assurance of Learning Ready  Many educational institutions today are focused 
on the notion of assurance of learning, an important element of many accreditation 
standards. Economics: The Basics, 3/e is designed specifically to support your 
­assurance of learning initiatives with a simple yet powerful solution.
	 Each chapter in the book begins with a list of numbered learning objectives, 
which appear throughout the chapter as well as in the end-of-chapter assignments. 
Every Test Bank question for Economics: The Basics, 3/e maps to a specific chapter 
learning objective in the textbook as well as topic area, Bloom’s Taxonomy level, 
and AACSB skill area. You can use our Test Bank software, TestGen, or Connect 
Economics to easily search for learning objectives that directly relate to the learn-
ing objectives for your course. You can then use the reporting features of TestGen 
to aggregate student results in similar fashion, making the collection and presenta-
tion of assurance of learning data simple and easy.
AACSB Statement  McGraw-Hill/Irwin is a proud corporate member of AACSB 
­International. Understanding the importance and value of AACSB accreditation, 
Economics: The Basics, 3/e recognizes the curricula guidelines detailed in the 
AACSB standards for business accreditation by connecting selected questions in 
the Test Bank and end-of-chapter material to the general knowledge and skill 
guidelines in the AACSB standards.
	 The statements contained in Economics: The Basics, 3/e are provided only as a 
guide for the users of this textbook. The AACSB leaves content coverage and as-
sessment within the purview of individual schools, the mission of the school, and 
the faculty. While Economics: The Basics, 3/e and the teaching package make no 
claim of any specific AACSB qualification or evaluation, we have, within Economics: 
The Basics, 3/e, labeled selected questions according to the six general knowl-
edge and skills areas.
Changes in the Third Edition
M Series  Mandel’s 3rd edition is now part of the M Series at McGraw-Hill. These 
products are unified through a magazine-like layout, succinct coverage, student-
friendly examples, and innovative digital support. M: Economics, The Basics is written 
specifically for the one semester survey course, designed to convey core concepts 
and principles at a level that is approachable for the widest possible audience.

	 The narrative in all chapters has been completely evaluated and reworked where 
necessary. Content and data updates to the figures, tables, and chapter narrative 
have been made throughout the book to reflect news events. In addition, select 
Spotlight and How It Works boxes have been updated or replaced to provide sce-
narios from today’s economic landscape. Additionally, all of the end-of-chapter 
problems are assignable through McGraw-Hill Connect, and select problems are 
available as algorithmic variations (for more information on Connect please refer to 
pages xiv–xv. Chapter-by-chapter changes are as follows:
Chapter 1 Introduction was substantially revised to reflect the events of the Great 
Recession and the recovery that followed. Figure 1.1 was updated, as were all of 
the figures and tables in the appendix (“The Basics of Graphs”). Problems were up-
dated with new, real-world data. 
Chapter 2 Demand and Supply: The Basics of the Market Economy now uses up-
dated examples and boxes, including the Spotlight “The Great Ethanol Boom.” New 
examples were added to the section on “New Markets.”
Chapter 3 Market Equilibrium and Shifts contains an updated chapter-opening vi-
gnette that details several economically significant events of April 2016. A box on 
highway construction was replaced by one on Atlantic City and excess supply of 
casinos. More material was added on the recent changes in the housing market. 
Figure 3.2 was updated, as were several problems. 
Chapter 4 How Businesses Work updates all the company examples in the text and 
in the boxes, such as the Spotlight boxes “Cut Your Tree, Mister?” and “Boeing’s 
Long-Term Decision.”  
Chapter 5 Competition and Market Power features data updates to the Spotlight 
boxes on the furniture and auto industries. Additionally, the How It Works boxes on 
well-known brand names and performers as monopolistic competitors have been 
updated. Problems were updated to include current data. 
Chapter 6 Government and the Economy was systematically updated, including 
boxes and problems. Figures 6.1 and 6.2 were updated. Coverage of government 
intervention in response to the Great Recession is now scattered throughout the 
chapter. 
Chapter 7 The First Step into Macroeconomics was revised to reflect the economy 
since the Great Recession. Table 7.1 and Figures 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4 were up-
dated to the most recent data. Boxes such as “Tracking the Global Corporation” 
were updated. Problems were updated to include the most recent data. 
Chapter 8 Inflation has substantially revised data throughout to reflect changes in 
the economy. Additionally, updates have been made to the How it Works boxes to 
accurately reflect changes in the economy to housing, air travel, and oil. The Spot-
light box “Which Movie Earned the Most Money” was updated to reflect 2015 hit 
movies such as Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The problems were extensively 
revised to reflect new data. 

Chapter 9 Growth features updated charts and tables, to reflect the Great Reces-
sion and its aftermath. Various boxes were updated and revised, including the Spot-
light “Community Colleges and Economic Growth,” Spotlight “Capital Investment in 
the Age of the Internet” and Spotlight “The Chinese Government and Growth.” The 
section on productivity, including Figure 9.9, was extensively modified to reflect the 
recent productivity slowdown.
Chapter 10 Business Cycles, Unemployment, and Inflation has been extensively 
updated and revised to reflect the post-recession performance of the economy. In 
particular, Figures 10.3, 10.5, and 10.6 have been updated with the latest data, as 
has the How It Works box on local unemployment. 
Chapter 11 Fiscal Policy has been updated to reflect the post-recession fiscal en-
vironment. The “How It Works” box on levels of government and the Spotlight on 
the impact of ARRA were both revised, as were Figures 11.3, 11.5, and 11.6.
Chapter 12 Monetary Policy has been substantially revised to feature the changes 
in monetary policy and the Federal Reserve in the aftermath of the recession, includ-
ing Janet Yellen installed as the new head of the Fed. The chapter includes a new 
section on quantitative easing, which now seems to be a permanent part of the Fed 
toolkit. A new section on the timing of rate increases has been added as well. Table 
12.2 has been revised to include quantitative easing, and Figures 12.3 and 12.5 
have been updated. The appendix on aggregate supply and aggregate demand has 
been revised as well to reflect recent events, including the falling price of oil. 
Chapter 13 The Financial Markets was revised to reflect the many changes in the 
financial markets since the Great Recession, focusing in particular on increased 
regulation and Dodd-Frank. We talked to the family highlighted in the Spotlight box 
“One Family’s Loans” and found out how they are doing today. Table 13.3, on how 
credit scores affect the interest rates borrowers pay, was updated, as were Table 
13.4 and Figure 13.6. The text was modified to take account of recent bond ­defaults 
by municipalities such as Detroit. Finally, the problems were updated. 
Chapter 14 International Trade has been substantially revised to take into account 
the current policy debates over trade. The section on “Winners and Losers” was 
greatly expanded, including a new Spotlight on states that have been hit hard and

pletely redone, and Figures 14.2a, 14.2b, 14.4, 14.5, 14.7, and 14.8 were revised 
with recent data. The Spotlight on how a German company creates American jobs

SUPPLEMENTS
Economics: The Basics, 3e comes with a complete array of instructor and student 
tools that make both teaching and learning easier.
Test Bank
Available in Connect, as Microsoft Word files, and via TestGen, the test bank includes a full comple-
ment of multiple-choice and short answer/essay questions to choose from. Created by Paul Fisher 
of Henry Ford Community College, the test bank is composed of more than a thousand unique 
questions that serve as a barometer of student mastery. 
	
The Test Bank is also now available in TestGen. TestGen is a complete, state-of-the-art test genera-
tor and editing application software that allows instructors to quickly and easily select test items from 
McGraw Hill’s test bank content. The instructors can then organize, edit and customize questions and 
answers to rapidly generate tests for paper or online administration. Questions can include stylized 
text, symbols, graphics, and equations that are inserted directly into questions using built-in mathe-
matical templates. TestGen’s random generator provides the option to display different text or calcu-
lated number values each time questions are used. With both quick-and-simple test creation and 
flexible and robust editing tools, TestGen is a complete test generator system for today’s educators.
PowerPoint Presentations
Learn as graphs come alive! Developed by Cynthia Foreman the PowerPoint presentations that ac-
company Mandel’s text incorporate both the fundamental concepts of each chapter and the graphs 
essential to each topic. Where appropriate, the graphs themselves are animated to demonstrate 
movement within a coordinate axis—something printed figures simply cannot do. The PowerPoint 
presentations successfully enhance the lessons in the text without providing a substitute for chapter 
reading or class attendance. 
Instructor’s Manual
Authored by Paul Fisher of Henry Ford Community College, the Instructor’s Manual includes pop 
quiz resources, common student stumbling blocks, and lecture notes. The manual is an invaluable 
resource for professors new to the course, as well as for TAs or other graduate instructors.
Solutions Manual
Suggested answers to the end-of-chapter questions are provided in this manual.

I want to thank Albert Kleine for his expert research assistance on the third edition of the text. I want to thank Richard Bur-
ton, Lili Chen, Peter Cunningham, Joseph Euculano, Paul Fisher, Cindy Foreman, Scott McGann, John W. Green, and Greg 
Obi for their time giving feedback on the previous edition. A special thanks to Ellen Mutari, Joe Euculano, and Mark Wilson 
for their contributions to the Connect offer that accompanies this edition.
	
I also want to thank the following people who were good enough to read and comment on chapters from the first and 
second editions of this text, including Chris Farrell, Sue Helper, Elliot Mandel, Judy Scherer, and Robert Stavins.

INTRODUCTION
was hit by the Great 
­Depression, an economic 
crisis that was far 
deeper than the recent 
Great Recession and 
lasted much longer. At the low point of the 
Great Depression, roughly one-quarter of 
the American workforce was unemployed. 
Construction came to a halt, farmers were 
desperate, and banks were closing. That 
terrible period—which seemed like it 
would never end—lasted a full decade.
	
But surprise! The Great Depression 
was followed by 75 years of strong eco-
nomic growth and rising living standards. 
Someone who graduated from high 
school during the Great Depression may 
have had a miserable time finding a first 
job but probably ended up enjoying a life-
time of rising wages, improved health, 
bigger homes, better education, and far 
more options for travel and entertain-
ment. One example: In 1929, air travel 
was a rarity, available only to a few peo-
ple. Today, traveling by air across the 
B
etween 2000 and 2015, the U.S. 
economy added more than 11 million 
jobs of all types, from well-paid software 
developers to medical technicians to fast-
food workers. In many ways, the economy 
looked like it was fully healed from the eco-
nomic downturn now known as the Great 
Recession. As of early 2016, the number of 
­unemployed Americans—people looking for 
a job but unable to find one—was almost 
down to pre-­recession levels. 
	
Yet the economic recovery still felt un-
even. While some parts of the country 
were thriving, like the area around San 
Francisco, other regions continued to suf-
fer. Manufacturing jobs were especially 
tough to find, and wages for many jobs 
were barely rising.
	
The economic picture was equally mixed 
in much of the rest of the world. Countries 
such as Germany and the United Kingdom 
were thriving as of early 2016, but Spain and 
Greece were still struggling. Young people, 
especially, had a hard time finding work in 
these countries. 
	
The question now is what the future will 
bring. Despite the apparent recovery, in 
early 2016 many Americans were pessi-
mistic. They worried that they would have a 
lower standard of living than their parents 
and that their kids would have an even 
tougher time. These concerns played an 
important role in the presidential campaign 
of 2016, which put Donald Trump into the 
White House.
	
But here, history offers a reason for op-
timism. Back in 1929, the United States

CH 01 
Introduction
­disagreement about whether the right solution is to 
get the government more involved or to rely more 
on private businesses. This question will continue 
to come up in the future—not just in the United 
States, but in the rest of the world as well.
THE BIG PICTURE  LO1-1 
This textbook will accomplish three goals for you. First, you’ll 
get the basic tools of economics, starting in Chapter 2 with sup-
ply and demand. When you’re finished, you won’t be an econo-
mist, but you will have learned a new way of thinking about 
today’s world.
	
Second, using these tools of economics, you can begin to 
understand markets and the 21st-century global market 
economy. In a market, buyers and sellers come 
together—not necessarily in the same place—
to voluntarily exchange goods and services for 
money. It may be the smallest of transactions, 
such as downloading an iPhone app for 99 
cents, or the $200 million purchase of a passen-
ger jet from Boeing by an airline or a wealthy 
individual. The market economy consists of all 
the different markets going on simultaneously.
	
Today the vast majority of economic activity worldwide 
is organized by market transactions: activities that produce 
and exchange goods and services that other people are will-
ing to pay for. From poor rice farmers in Cambodia to multi-
millionaire investment bankers on Wall Street, markets are 
essential, and this book will show you how they work.
	
Third, you’ll see the ways in which the possibilities of 
today’s economy are expanding. More precisely, at any mo-
ment households are limited in what they can purchase by 
their income and by the range of products and services avail-
able (you can’t yet buy your own spaceship). Businesses are 
limited in what they can produce by technology and by their 
past investments in factories, processes, and materials. Many 
countries remain poor and thus limited in their economic 
capabilities.
	
But these constraints change every day. Some things that 
were impossible or very expensive a few years ago have now 
become commonplace. New technologies let us communicate 
United States or to other countries 
is common. Or consider health: 
People are far more likely to live 
65 years or more today than they 
were in 1929, when illnesses such 
as diphtheria and tuberculosis 
were major causes of death.
What will the next 75 years 
bring? Change happens so quickly 
now that even 5 or 10 years can 
dramatically alter our lives. By 
some forecasts, China could pass 
the United States as the world’s 
largest economy within the near 
future. The Internet brings us more 
entertainment and in-
formation every day, as 
well as increasing 
amounts of misinformation and opportu-
nities for fraud. Advances in health tech-
nology may significantly advance our life 
spans, bringing all the societal implica-
tions of a large elderly population. The 
threat of global climate change has increased pres-
sure to move away from fossil fuels such as coal and 
oil to other energy sources such as solar, wind, and 
nuclear power. We could see cities built in space, or 
underwater.
	
As the global economy speeds into the future, the 
big question is: Who is steering? Or to put it another 
way, how much should governments intervene in the 
economy? Consider, for example, the key question of 
immigration. How many immigrants should the fed-
eral government let into the United States, and what 
qualifications should they have?
	
Or take health care—one of the biggest and fast-
est-growing sectors of the economy. President 
Barack Obama signed a major health care reform 
bill in spring 2010 that improved access to health 
insurance for many Americans. Yet there is still 
Economic Milestone
THE FIRST 
MICROPROCESSOR
1971
The first microprocessor—a “computer on a chip”—was created in 1971 by Intel. 
At the time, Intel was a small start-up company, and the tiny chip, called the 4004, 
was designed to run a Japanese calculator. What was new, though, was that the 
4004 could be programmed to do a wide variety of tasks. This was the true 
beginning of the Information Age. Today, Intel is one of the best-known 
companies in the world, and microprocessors are found in everything from 
computers and cell phones to televisions and cars.

World’s Fair in New York City. This was the 
AT&T Picturephone, and it was a commercial 
failure. It wasn’t until many years later that 
videoconferencing became available—first, 
for businesses, and then for individuals 
through programs such as Skype and 
FaceTime.
	
Most products take multiple attempts to become practi-
cal. For example, the Apple iPhone was introduced in 2007. 
Before that, mobile phones could be used to talk with other 
people, but they had far less usefulness in terms of down-
loading information, entertainment, or games.
	
Technological change is uneven, moving much faster in 
some industries than others. Although information technol-
ogy has evolved rapidly in recent decades, the pace of 
change in energy technologies has been much slower. De-
spite the rise of electric cars, virtually all cars sold in the 
United States are still powered by internal combustion 
­engines—a technology first invented in Germany in the 
1880s. Nuclear power has turned out to be far more expen-
sive and troublesome than expected, and the 2011 disaster at 
Japan’s Fukushima nuclear power plant has raised more 
questions about safety. Meanwhile renewable energy 
sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, still provide 
only 9.4 percent of U.S. energy needs as of 2013.
	
However, with global climate 
change on everybody’s minds these 
days, and the price of oil so high, com-
panies and governments have more in-
centive to invest in developing new 
energy technologies that either are 
cheaper or emit fewer greenhouse 
gases. As a result, the pace of energy-
related technological change may 
accelerate.
globally far more cheaply than ever before. Countries that 
were once poor, such as China and India, have become produc-
tive dynamos. The stock market and other financial markets 
are now far more accessible to ordinary people and small 
businesses.
	
For all these reasons, we’ll pay special attention to the 
main forces driving change in today’s economy.
KEY FORCES SHAPING TODAY’S 
ECONOMY  LO1-2 
Let’s look individually at three of the main forces shaping 
today’s economy: technological change, globalization, and 
the evolution of financial markets.
Technological Change
The forward progress of technology and sci-
ence is the primary force for economic 
growth—not just in the United States, but ev-
erywhere. From the development of the steam 
engine, the automobile, and electricity through 
the creation of computers and the Internet, 
technological change has been the critical factor 
in raising living standards.
	
Technological change, broadly speaking, is any improve-
ment in knowledge that increases the ­quantity and range of 
goods and services the economy can deliver. One example of 
technological change is the introduction of a new electronic 
product, such as the first microprocessor or the first mobile 
telephone, that lets people do things they couldn’t do before 
(see the “Economic Milestone” box on page 4). Other 
­examples of technological change include the invention of 
decaffeinated coffee in 1903 in Germany and the 2013 intro-
duction of a new cure for Hepatitis C, the most common 
bloodborne infection.
	
The term “technological change,” as economists use it, also 
applies to new ways of organizing work. For example, in the 
1950s, McDonald’s became immensely profitable by adapting 
assembly-line methods to the restaurant industry. The result 
was “fast food” mass-produced at low prices. Technological 
change includes creativity in entertainment as well. Walt Dis-
ney, who died in 1966, created the animated feature film. 
Originally hand-drawn by teams of animators, those early 
films evolved into the computer animation we know today. 
Early video games, too, represented a form of technological 
change.
Successful technological change or innovation is much 
more difficult than it looks. Plenty of ideas look promis-
ing at first, but they take years or decades to get turned 
into successful products or businesses. For example, the 
first video telephone, which allowed you to see the person 
on the other end of the call, was demonstrated at the 1964

knowledge that in-
creases the quantity 
and range of goods 
and services an econ-

CH 01 
Introduction
Companies such as Boeing and Intel, the giant U.S. semi-
conductor manufacturer, get much of their revenue from  
outside the United States.
	
Globalization also acts as a reality check. In an economy 
walled off from the global economy, it’s easy for companies 
and workers to grow complacent and sluggish. Foreign com-
petition shakes things up, forcing everyone to try harder and 
to look for better ways of doing things.
	
Of course, the impact of the global economy is not all posi-
tive. Foreign competition can wipe out jobs at home, force 
down wages and profits, and cause deep-seated insecurity. The 
flood of cheap imports in recent years, while clearly benefiting 
American consumers, has ravaged manufacturing industries in 
the United States, eliminating millions of domestic jobs.
	
In response to such effects, it’s tempting to pull up the 
drawbridge, close the gates, and pretend the outside world 
doesn’t exist. The United States is a big country; in theory, 
U.S. factories could produce almost everything we import 
today, from toys to clothing to computers. Moreover, the 
stunning rise in domestic oil production in recent years has 
greatly lessened the U.S. dependence on oil imports.
	
Yet today, every successful national economy is tied into 
the broader global economy. Closed economies—that is, ones 
that are cut off from the rest of the world—may do better in 
the short run, but history shows they quickly lose their vitality 
and fall behind. Over time it has become clear that countries 
that are open to international trade do better than those that 
are isolated (see “Spotlight: The Chinese Economy”).

The third force driving today’s economy forward is the evolu-
tion of the financial markets. The ­financial markets (some-
times also called the ­financial system) encompass all parts 
of the economy that have to do with borrowing, investing, or 
transferring money. That includes the stock market, where 
investors can buy and sell shares of companies; the residen-
tial mortgage market, where people can borrow money to 
buy homes; and the venture capital market, where start-up 
companies can raise funds to finance their early years. The 
financial markets also include banks, brokerage firms, mu-
tual funds, credit card providers, and financiers. Government 
regulators, which in the United States include such agencies 
as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal 
Reserve Board, are part of the financial markets as well.
Globalization
Globalization is the increasing exchange 
of goods, services, ideas, and people 
among countries. To a greater extent 
than ever before, we live in a global 
economy. The United States imports 
cheese from New Zealand, television 
sets from Taiwan, fish from Ecuador, 
tires from Romania, clothing from  
Turkey . . . the list is almost endless.
But trade in manufactured goods and 
foodstuffs is only one aspect of globaliza-
tion. More and more international trade—
both exports and imports—consists of 
intangible services. For example, when 
you call customer support for your new 
computer, you may get routed to a call center in India. The ser-
vices of those Indian customer representatives are being imported 
into the United States or wherever you might be located.
	
Global flows of information—ideas, research, entertain-
ment, and other forms of communication—have vastly in-
creased as well. Many more people are also crossing 
international borders for business, for tourism, or to immi-
grate permanently. The number of international travelers—not 
including immigrants—rose by 79 percent from 1998 to 2013. 
	
Why are countries so much more interconnected these 
days? Technological change is one reason. It is now possible 
to communicate from virtually any spot on the globe to virtu-
ally any other spot at almost no cost. If a retailer like Walmart 
in the United States is running low on, say, size 12 jeans, it 
can immediately flash a new order to a clothing factory in 
China, Thailand, or wherever the production is done.
Technology by itself, however, is not enough to explain 
the pull of globalization. Most people accept that being open 
to the global economy brings enormous advantages. In-
comes in countries such as Korea, China, and ­India started 
rising at a rapid rate only when they focused on becoming 
­exporters—that is, when they produced what the rest of the 
world wanted.
	
For a rich country like the United States, a big benefit of 
foreign trade is access to cheaper goods and services. The 
price of clothing to American consumers has fallen by 5 per-
cent since 1995, mainly because of soaring imports from 
low-cost producers overseas. In addition, a global economy 
greatly expands the size of the potential market for exporters.

crisis later in the textbook, but here we will give a quick 
summary. Between 2000 and 2007, many Americans bor-
rowed more money than their incomes could support. In par-
ticular, they borrowed money to buy homes because the prices 
of homes were rising and seemed like a sure investment.
But when housing prices in much of the country peaked 
in  2006 and started plunging in  2007, suddenly many 
Americans found that they owed more money than their 
homes were worth. The problems hit many financial institu-
tions as well, which had lent large sums of money under the 
assumption that home prices would keep going up. The re-
sult: billions of dollars of losses at big financial institutions. 
Moreover, there was a danger of a chain reaction, where the 
losses at one big bank or other financial institution would 
cause it to fail, and pull down other companies with it. 
That’s why the government had to intervene to keep the 
­financial markets from collapsing in fall 2008.
THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT  LO1-3 
In response to the Great Recession and the financial crisis, 
the U.S. government took aggressive steps to fight unem-
ployment and the economic slowdown. Yet Washington 
policymakers were criticized both for not doing enough and 
for interfering too much in the economy.
This debate is an example of a more general concern: 
Should the economy be guided by politicians and govern-
ment regulators, or should individuals and private busi-
nesses be allowed to make business decisions as they 
please? This question comes up in all sorts of situations. At 
one extreme is a centrally planned economy, in which 
most economic activities are controlled by the 
government. In the past, the ­Soviet Union—
which collapsed in 1991—approached this 
mode. The government owned all the factories 
and decided what they would produce, how 
much, and at what selling price. At the other 
extreme would be an imaginary economy with 
few or no government 
regulations or laws at 
all—what economists call 
a laissez-faire economy.
	
Obviously, neither of these two ex-
tremes is workable. But virtually every 
debate over economic policy boils 
down to finding the right balance be-
tween government intervention and 
free competition. Let’s get a better idea 
of what these terms mean.
Economic Competition
The common definition of competition 
is “a rivalry between contestants to 
achieve a goal or reward.” Workers 
	
Over the long run, the spread of financial 
markets has helped fuel economic growth. 
Companies, individuals, and governments can 
use financial markets to raise money for useful 
activities. As just one example, Facebook, the 
social networking company, was able to ex-
pand faster because it received venture capital 
funding.
	
Most people justifiably have mixed feelings 
about financial markets, which can experience violent 
swings. For Americans who have invested their retirement 
savings in the stock market, these downturns can seem dev-
astating. Over the long run—say, 20 years—the stock mar-
ket has historically almost always gone up. But in the short 
run, it is subject to wide swings that can create large for-
tunes or steal hard-earned investments. Pick the right stock, 
and you can turn a small stack of money into a much larger 
pile. But make a bad investment or get caught in a stock mar-
ket crash, and you can see your life savings disappear.
	
This popular distrust toward the financial markets was 
aggravated over the past decade by some particularly vio-
lent gyrations in the markets that badly damaged the rest of 
the economy. We will read much more about this financial 
SPOTLIGHT: THE CHINESE 
ECONOMY
If you check the label on your clothing, there’s a good 
chance it will say “Made in China.” Your iPhone, if you 
own one, probably says “Assembled in China” on the 
back. The same is true for many laptop computers, toys, 
motorcycles, ­appliances, and all sorts of other goods.
	
Thirty years ago, it would have been almost impossi-
ble for you to find anything in the United States that 
was made in China. In 1978, China was the most popu-
lous country in the world, with a billion people. But it 
was also one of the poorest countries, barely able to 
feed itself and certainly possessing no ability to com-
pete economically with the United States.
	
Since then, China has undergone one of the great 
economic transformations in history. Starting in the late 
1970s, the government relaxed some aspects of its 
control over the economy, encouraged markets, and 
took steps to foster trade with the rest of the world.
	
The result: China is now the largest global exporter 
of goods. Perhaps more important, many Chinese are 
far better off than their parents were 30 years ago. The 
country still has poor regions and political unrest. The 
rapid growth has also caused problems like severe air 
pollution in Beijing and Shanghai. But China, at least, up 
to this point, is a global economic success story.

Introduction
­economic competition seems to leave behind large pock-
ets of poverty—people who are jobless and homeless.
Government Intervention
Government intervention represents the actions taken by 
government to affect the economy. Indeed, it would be im-
possible to do business without basic laws governing fraud 
and contracts. The government issues money, insures bank 
deposits so people can trust banks, and regulates the banks 
and the financial system. Regulations govern the ­details of 
daily life. They dictate how our homes are wired and whether 
our cars have seat belts or airbags, and they ensure that you 
can use your computer in the same room as your television 
without the signals creating interference on the screen. The 
Food and Drug Administration must approve new drugs for 
safety and usefulness before they can be sold in the United 
States, and the Federal Aviation Administration certifies 
new aircraft before they can be flown.
	
Moreover, the government generally takes responsibility 
for making sure the economy doesn’t fall into deep slumps 
in which millions of people lose their jobs. This role has 
been highlighted during the Great Recession. In 2008, the 
Federal Reserve—the central bank of the United States—
lent financial institutions billions of dollars to ensure that 
they would not fail and drag down the economy when the 
overheated housing market crashed. Also in 2008, President 
George W. Bush signed into law the Troubled Asset Relief 
Program (TARP), which made $700 billion available to help 
prop up the troubled financial sector. After President Obama 
took office in 2009, he signed the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act (ARRA), which spent almost $800 billion 
in an effort to create jobs across the whole economy. After 
the Great Recession ended, the Federal Reserve kept interest 
rates low for many years to ensure that the economy did not 
slip back into a downturn again.
	
Even during normal times, every country draws a different 
line between the appropriate role of the government and the 
appropriate role of private businesses and individuals. In 
­Canada and the United Kingdom, health care is provided by 
the government. And the Chinese government regularly exer-
cises control over where its citizens live and how many chil-
dren they can have. For years, families in China were limited to 
only one child. That “one-child” policy was changed to a “two-
child” policy in 2016, but the government control still exists.
In practice, centrally planned economies seem to do poorly 
over the long run. Top-down management reduces insecurity, 
but at the cost of reducing incentives to innovate and make 
improvements. In a competitive economy, businesses react 
quickly to changing conditions; they don’t have any choice if 
they want to stay in business. And unlike businesses in 
planned economies, they can use new technology without 
waiting for permission from a central authority.
Over the past 30 years, most countries have moved in the 
direction of less intervention by government, a process 
known as deregulation. For example, in the United States, 
compete for jobs and promotions. Universities compete to 
attract good students. Companies compete for customers or 
for market dominance. States compete to attract new 
businesses.
	
Economic competition is the effort by people and busi-
nesses to achieve a desirable outcome, given what everyone 
else is doing. The most important economic competition 
happens within the context of a market. Buyers compete to 
get the best deals at the lowest prices; sellers compete to sell 
the most products for the highest prices. McDonald’s com-
petes with Wendy’s to sell hamburgers, while Boeing com-
petes with the European company Airbus to sell passenger 
airplanes.
	
History suggests that economic competition—conducted 
within a fair set of rules—is the most consistent force for 
growth and progress. A company has a much stronger incen-
tive to innovate and to produce a better and cheaper product 
if it knows that its rival down the block or across the ocean is 
trying to take its customers. The influx of inexpensive, reli-
able cars from Japan in the 1980s forced General Motors, 
Ford, and Chrysler to improve the reliability of their own 
cars and to come up with a whole new type of vehicle—the 
minivan. More recently the success of the hybrid gas–
electric cars from Toyota and Honda compelled U.S. auto 
manufacturers to move more quickly to introduce their 
own hybrid models.
	
The most competitive large economy in the world, by 
most reckonings, is the United States. ­Developing countries 
such as China and India have prospered by introducing more 
elements of a U.S.-style economy, including more competi-
tion, start-ups of new companies, and much less top-down 
management by government.
	
What is the attraction of the U.S. economic model? The 
simplest answer is that it has a long track record of success. 
Despite recent problems, the United States has enjoyed con-
sistently strong economic growth over time. Most people 
living in the United States enjoy a high living standard, 
meaning they have ample access to necessities such as food, 
clothing, and shelter and luxuries such 
as entertainment and travel. U.S. com-
panies and workers have also shown a 
remarkable ability to adapt to new tech-
nologies and a changing global econ-
omy, in part because they have always 
been used to competing.
Still, the idea of unbridled eco-
nomic competition with no govern-
ment intervention troubles many 
people because it seems to lead to in-
security, waste, and unnecessary hos-
tility. After all, if there is a winner, 
there must be losers. If companies are 
competing for the same customers, 
the one who comes in second may 
be  forced to lay off workers. And

Indicators of Prosperity
Economics is always concerned with what can be done to 
improve people’s lives, keeping in mind the need to make 
trade-offs. Ultimately, we judge the success or failure of an 
economy by the prosperity of its inhabitants. Of course, this 
leaves open the question of precisely how to measure pros-
perity. As you will see in this textbook, economists like to 
quantify (or put numbers on) the things they study, and there 
are lots of different ways to measure how well an economy 
and its members are doing.
	
For example, we can look at the total output of an econ-
omy, also called its gross domestic product (see “How It 
Works” on page 10). In an important sense, the more goods 
and services an economy can produce, the better it is doing. 
That’s why ­economists want to make sure the total output of 
the economy keeps growing.
But economists look at other measures as well to gauge 
economic success. For example, government statisticians 
produce reams of data on wages and benefits. That’s cer-
tainly one indicator of how well people are doing. Another 
important statistic is annual household income, which in-
cludes pay for workers plus other sources of money such as 
Social Security and income from investments. Economists 
also keep an eye on household consumption, which is the 
amount of goods and services a typical household consumes 
in a year.
	
Depending on which indicator you look at, there can be a 
big difference in a person’s prosperity. For example, a stu-
dent in college may have no income but may still have a 
good standard of living, including travel and entertainment. 
A rich person who is not working won’t receive any wage 
payments but may still have plenty of money from 
investments.
	
Then there are non-monetary measures of prosperity. 
We can survey people and ask them how happy they are. 
We can look at whether life expectancy—the 
number of years that people are expected to 
live—is rising. And we can ask whether the 
quality of the environment is getting better or 
worse. Although these indicators are not 
purely economic, they are 
still important to an over-
all feeling of prosperity.
The Safety Net
Any successful modern economy 
must allow all its members to share in 
its prosperity. It’s not politically or 
morally acceptable for most of the 
population to live good lifestyles 
while a smaller number are much 
worse off.
	
That’s why the United States and 
other industrialized countries have a 
President Jimmy Carter started reducing government control 
over the airline and trucking industries in the late 1970s. 
That process was greatly accelerated by President Ronald 
Reagan when he took office in January 1981.
	
About the same time on the other side of the globe, 
­Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping began the process of shifting 
China away from a centrally planned economy. Today, China 
still has many people working in state-owned factories, but it 
also has a vibrant private business sector that has made 
China the largest exporter in the world.
Finding a Balance
In practice, both competition and government are present in 
every part of the economy. The housing market is a good 
example. Most homes are built by private developers, not by 
the government. But developers and builders must work 
within a framework of zoning rules and construction codes 
set by the government.
	
When people want to borrow money to buy a home, they 
usually go to a private lender (a bank) or a mortgage broker. 
But the government has arranged the tax code to benefit 
home buyers who take out mortgages: Mortgage interest 
payments are typically tax deductible, which helps save 
households billions in taxes. And in the aftermath of the 
Great Recession, the government intervened to ensure that 
mortgage money would keep flowing.
THE DEFINITION OF  
ECONOMICS  LO1-4 
Economics is a very broad subject that covers everything 
from global growth to the price of apples at a local super-
market. That’s why we need a broad definition. From a wide 
perspective, economics is about how we make 
decisions, given that we can’t have everything. 
To put it more precisely, economics is the study 
of how individuals, businesses, and govern-
ments make decisions and trade-offs in the face 
of scarce resources.
	
You could be a home owner trying to de-
cide whether to allocate your money to buying 
a new car or to fixing the roof. Or you could 
be a business manager trying to decide whether to open a 
new store or put money into fixing up an existing one. Or 
you could be a government official choosing whether to 
create educational scholarships or fund health care for the 
elderly. In each of these cases, it’s necessary to make a 
trade-off because only a limited amount of money is 
available.
This way of thinking about economics will be very im-
portant in this textbook, especially when we consider the 
behavior of consumers, workers, and businesses in the early 
chapters. It reflects the reality of the world.

Introduction
Suppose you had to fill out a government form that asked, 
“How big are you?” You could give your height, your 
weight, your waist size, your shoe size, your hat size, or 
any other possible physical measurement.
	
Similarly, there are plenty of ways to measure an econ-
omy. But one key indicator is known as gross domestic 
product (GDP), which is the dollar value of the total output 
of a national economy over a year.1 GDP includes the 
value of all the food produced in the country, the value of 
its cars and trucks, and the amount of money spent on 
health care plus more. GDP also includes the value of tick-
ets for sporting events, the money paid by consumers for 
phone service, and the cost of all the goods and services 
provided by federal, state, and local governments, such as 
defense, education, and road repair.
	
In the United States, the value of GDP is calculated by 
the Bureau of Economic Analysis, one of the major statisti-
cal agencies of the federal government. For 2015, the 
GDP of the United States was $17.9 trillion, an almost un-
imaginably large number. This comes to roughly $58,000 
for every woman, man, and child in the country. (We’ll look 
at GDP in more detail in Chapter 7.)
	
Other countries calculate GDP as well, using roughly 
the same set of rules as the United States. Figure 1.1 
shows the 10 largest economies in the world in 2015, 
measured by GDP.

Likewise, although everyone agrees 
that education is crucial, there is no 
consensus among ­economists—or 
anyone else, for that matter—about 
how best to improve the educational 
system. Many economists argue that 
“money talks,” so spending more re-
sources on education, especially for the younger grades, is 
the right thing to do. But an influential group of econo-
mists believes, based on empirical studies, that spending 
money to reduce class size has little impact on educational 
achievement.
	
And then there’s higher education. Some economists 
want the federal government to provide more scholarship 
funds, enabling more poor children to go to college. Others 
argue that if the government provides more scholarship 
funds, colleges will simply cut their financial aid packages 
or raise tuition by the same amount, leaving poor students in 
the same quandary.
	
What about the government’s role in determining the 
course of technology? Right now cable companies and phone 
companies are vying to provide broadband connections to 
homes. Will market forces produce the best solution, or could 
government intervention improve the outcome? Should Con-
gress pass legislation to force auto manufacturers to sell more 
fuel-efficient vehicles, or would that deprive us of our right to 
drive gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles?
	
Perhaps most important is the ongoing controversy about 
the right level of federal taxes. Should federal taxes be 
higher, lower, or completely revamped to make them sim-
pler? President Bill ­Clinton raised federal income taxes in 
1993 to reduce the federal budget deficit, and his actions 
were applauded by many well-known economists. But when 
President George W. Bush sharply cut taxes in 2001 and 
2003, he received applause from equally well-known econo-
mists. Today, the big question is whether taxes should be 
raised on high-income households. There is simply no con-
sensus in the economics profession about this question (and 
don’t let anyone tell you there is).
	
Why do economists disagree about so many vital policy 
questions? In many cases, we don’t have enough data to be 
sure of the right answer. In other cases, the controversy is ag-
gravated by the political agendas of those who stand to gain 
or lose from policy changes. In this textbook, we will present 
both sides of controversial issues and help you 
understand the reasoning behind each of them.
Economics is a dynamic subject, always 
evolving to keep up with changes in the econ-
omy. With any luck, this textbook will help you 
better understand both the subject of econom-
ics and the economy we live in.
safety net, the government programs that provide a measure of 
security for the poor, the sick, and the vulnerable. In the United 
States, the safety net consists of a wide array of programs with 
familiar names: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, unem-
ployment insurance, food stamps, housing subsidies, and tax 
credits for low-income wage earners.
	
The safety net makes an enormous difference in the well-
being of low-income households. The food stamp program, 
for example, provided low-cost food to roughly 47 million 
Americans in 2014, with the average person getting $1,500 
in benefits. The Medicaid program helped about 54 million 
low-income people with medical costs. And the earned in-
come tax credit—a tax program designed to help low-­
income wage earners—gave an average benefit of roughly 
$2,500 to 27 million U.S. tax filers.
	
Still, there is widespread disagreement about whether the 
U.S. government is doing enough to help the poor. The in-
come and wealth gap between rich and poor has increased in 
recent years, so that the top 20 percent of U.S. households get 
about half the country’s income. In 2014, the Census Bureau 
reported that there were 47 million Americans who were 
­officially designated as living below the poverty line.
	
By comparison, European countries such as France and 
Germany pride themselves on the strength of their social 
safety nets, which offer comprehensive medical care, better 
retirement benefits, and more job security than in the United 
States. Yet, until very recently, these countries have also 
consistently suffered from a worse unemployment problem 
than the United States has. For all its shortcomings, no one 
has yet come up with an economic model clearly superior to 
that of the United States.
DISAGREEMENTS IN  
ECONOMICS  LO1-5 
In some areas of economics, there is little disagreement. 
However, plenty of important policy questions divide econo-
mists when it comes to the right amount of government 
­intervention in the economy. For example, reputable econo-
mists disagree about whether the government’s response to 
the Great ­Recession was too big, too small, or just right.
	
Then there is the debate over how big the government’s 
role should be in health, education, and retirement. How can 
we pay for Social Security and Medicare as the 
baby boom generation retires? Some critics of 
President Obama’s health care reform argued 
that it called for too much government interfer-
ence in the private sector. Meanwhile, other 
economists thought that health care should be 
completely paid for by the government.

SUMMARY
	 1.	The basic tools of economics developed in this text-
book, such as supply and demand, are essential for un-
derstanding markets and the global market economy 
that we all live in. (LO1-1)
	 2.	Three key forces shaping today’s economy are tech-
nological change, globalization, and the evolution of 
financial markets. Technological change is an im-
provement in knowledge that increases the range of 
products and services the economy can deliver. Glo-
balization is the increasing exchange of goods, ser-
vices, ideas, and people among countries. And 
financial markets affect any person or business who 
borrows, invests or, spends money. (LO1-2)
	 3.	An important economic policy debate is the appropri-
ate role of government in the ­economy—that is, the 
degree to which individuals and private businesses 
can make decisions as they please without interfer-
ence from politicians and government regulators. 
Most economists believe that economic competition—
conducted within a fair set of rules—is the most con-
sistent force for growth and progress. (LO1-3)
	 4.	Economics is defined as the study of making deci-
sions in the face of scarce resources. The goal of eco-
nomic policy, broadly defined, is to raise the prosperity 
of the inhabitants of a country. (LO1-4)
	 5.	Economists often disagree about the right way to 
raise prosperity. Important economic policy debates 
include the level of taxes, and the nature of the gov-
ernment’s role in such areas as health care and edu-
cation. (LO1-5)

THE BASICS OF GRAPHS
In this textbook, we use several different kinds of graphs. But 
don’t be scared: The purpose of graphs is to help you by giving a 
visual representation of economic concepts or numerical 
relationships. For example, we can compare the sizes of two 
economies with numbers, or we can use the visual representation 
of a bar graph, like Figure 1.1. We also use graphs to plot the 
behavior of individuals or firms in markets, or to help understand 
the behavior of the whole economy.
READING DATA FROM 
GRAPHS  LO1A-1 
Graphs can be used to convey economic infor-
mation visually. Figure 1.1, reproduced here as 
Figure 1A.1, is a bar graph that compares the 
size of different economies, measured in dol-
lars. A bar graph conveys information using 
vertical bars. This graph has a horizontal axis 
(sometimes called the x-axis) and a vertical 
axis (sometimes called the y-axis). In this 
graph, the horizontal axis contains a list of 
countries, and the vertical axis reports on the 
size of each country’s economy. The height of 
the bars ­represents the size of each economy. 
So the United States has a bigger economy than 
France, measured in dollars.

per person in the household on entertainment. (This includes 
teenage children, of course!) Entertainment spending in-
cludes tickets for sporting events, movies, and 
concerts; purchases of consumer electronics, 
sports equipment, and 
toys; and spending on pets.
How do we turn this 
into a graph? The first 
­column of ­categories—in 
this case, the different age 
	
We can read the size of each economy off the graph. For 
example, the bar labeled “Japan” goes a bit over the line la-
beled 4.0. That means Japan’s economy is slightly higher 
than $4.0 trillion (actually, it was $4.1 trillion).
	
Another type of data graph is a line graph. A line graph, 
as the name shows, conveys information using a line. For 
example, Figure 1A.2 shows the population of the United 
States since 1990. To determine, for example, the population 
of the United States in 1999, we start from 1999 on the hori-
zontal axis and trace straight up until we reach the line. Then 
we look to the vertical axis and see that there were just under 
280 million Americans in 1999.
PLOTTING GRAPHS  
FROM DATA  LO1A-2 
With the data graphs just described, you can read the data 
from the graph. But often in economics, you will be asked to 
go the other direction: Given a table of numbers, you have to 
be able to graph it. That is, you plot the data 
points on the graph, one by one. Then if neces-
sary you connect the points.
	
Consider Table 1A.1, which reports on en-
tertainment spending per person in 2014 for 
households headed by people of different ages. 
For example, a household headed by a person 
45–54 years old will spend $1,200 on average

groups—goes along the horizontal axis. Then for each 
number, we go to the corresponding level of the vertical 
axis. So for a household headed by a 45–54-year-old, we 
run our finger up until we get to the $3,200 level, and that’s 
where we put our point. We do that for each category on the 
horizontal axis, as shown in Figure 1A.3.
	
We can leave those points like that, or we can connect 
them with lines, as in Figure 1A.4.
	
One thing to notice about Figure 1A.4 is that the line is 
upward-sloping from the category “under 25 years” to the 
category “35–44 years.” That means the line goes from the 
bottom left to the top right, so that higher values on the hori-
zontal axis are generally associated with higher values of on 
the vertical axis. An upward-sloping line means, in this case, 
that entertainment spending per person increases as the age 
of the head of household increases from under 25 years old 
to 35–44 years old.
Let’s look at another graph. Since 
1950, the population of the city of 
Cleveland, Ohio, has been steadily fall-
ing, as shown in Table 1A.2.
We will graph these data in Figure 
1A.5. The first column, which is the 
years, goes on the horizontal axis. The

vertical axis is the population. As before, we begin by plotting 
each data point, starting from the horizontal axis and moving 
up. For example, the population of Cleveland in 1990 was 
roughly 500 thousand people, so we go up from 1990 to the 
line labeled 500 and put a point there. Then we connect the 
points in sequence.
This graph is downward-sloping, which means that 
higher values on the horizontal axis are generally associated 
with lower values on the vertical axis. In this case, the popu-
lation of Cleveland decreases as we move to the right along 
the graph to later years.

CH 02 DEMAND AND 
SUPPLY: THE 
BASICS OF  
THE MARKET 
ECONOMY
This chapter intro-
duces the basics of the 
market economy. First 
we’ll explore the differ-
ences among local, na-
tional, and global markets. Next we’ll look 
separately at ­demand and supply in 
­markets—that is, the behavior of buyers and 
sellers. Then we’ll briefly discuss the cre-
ation of new markets.
R
emember Legos, those little plastic 
building blocks? In June 2015, the 
world’s then-tallest Lego tower was built 
in Milan, Italy. Constructed from 550,000 
Lego bricks, the tower stretched an im-
pressive 114 feet high.
	
A market economy, such as that of the 
United States or Italy, is a bit like a Lego 
tower. It’s an economic system made up of 
smaller “building blocks” of individual mar-
kets for trading all the different goods and 
services used in a country.
	
The variety of different markets is al-
most too big to grasp. It ranges from the 
market for homes in Chicago, to the on-
line market for video games, to the market 
for airline tickets between London and 
Shanghai (an 11-hour flight!), to the mar-
ket for pizza in Missoula, Montana (which, 
in late 2015, included 38 pizza stores, ac-
cording to the Yahoo! yellow pages).

are unlikely to travel to a different part of the country to have 
your teeth cleaned. Similarly, many personal services such 
as haircuts, dry cleaning, and shoe repairs are handled in 
­local markets. Even in today’s global economy, no one is go-
ing to ship their dresses or shirts to ­India to be dry-cleaned, 
even if it’s cheaper there!
	
In contrast, a national market lets buyers and sellers 
conduct transactions across the country. Thanks to the Inter-
net and fast transportation, an increasing number of goods 
and services are traded in national markets. Do you want to 
open a stock account? No matter where in the United States 
you live, you can buy those stock-trading ser-
vices from a broker anywhere else in the coun-
try. You can go house-hunting on the Internet 
and buy books, clothes, electronics, and music 
online. You can hire professionals in other parts 
of the country to improve your résumé or do 
your taxes.
Similarly, global markets allow buyers and 
sellers to be anywhere in the world. Crude oil 
has been sold on global markets for decades, as have steel, 
fish, natural gas, and memory chips. Global markets are of-
ten the province of globe-spanning companies called multi-
nationals, which have operations in multiple countries. The 
giant oil company ExxonMobil, for example, does energy 
exploration and production in 36 countries and sells oil, nat-
ural gas, gasoline, and lubricants almost everywhere around 
the globe.
	
One of the most remarkable changes in recent years is the 
seemingly overnight transformation of some local markets 
into vibrant national or global markets. The creation of the 
online auction site eBay in 1995 in the living room of 
founder Pierre Omidyar enabled the traditional yard sale to 
reach a national audience. Rather than simply advertising in 
a local paper, individuals can now sell their antique lamps or 
comic book collections to buyers around the country. And to 
an increasing degree, services that used to be done locally in 
the United States can now be outsourced to other countries. 
Preparing tax returns, for example, used to be the classic lo-
cal service: You brought your box of receipts to your local 
accountant, who put your tax return together. Now the infor-
mation can be transmitted to India, where the return is pre-
pared at a much lower cost and transmitted back to the 
United States.
The Market Price
In economics, we balance the wonderful complexity of the 
real world with the useful simplicity and clarity of eco-
nomic models. In the previous section, for example, we 
talked about the price of a good or service as if there were 
only one price. In the real world, however, even identical 
cars may sell at different prices depending on which deal-
erships they are bought from and how well the buyers 
negotiate.
PRICES, BUYERS, AND  
SELLERS  LO2-1 
Any market has one or more buyers and one or more sell-
ers. In the market, the buyer pays money in exchange for a 
product—a good or service. The sellers receive money in 
exchange for supplying the product. The rate at which the 
buyer and seller exchange money for the good or service is 
known as the price.
A simple example is the market for apples, say, in your 
town. There may be several sellers—the local supermarkets, 
the organic food store, and the corner deli. 
There are generally many 
buyers, such as people 
who enjoy eating apples 
and restaurants that make 
apple pie. The price is the 
amount a buyer pays per 
pound of apples (in 2014, 
the average price of a 
pound of Red Delicious apples was 
$1.35).
It’s usually easy to figure out who 
are the buyers and sellers in a market. 
The individuals or businesses with the 
cash or credit cards in their hands, or 
writing the checks, are the buyers. The 
people or businesses collecting the 
money are the sellers.
But keep in mind that each individual 
or business is typically a buyer in some 
markets and a seller in others. For exam-
ple, the typical worker is a seller in the 
labor market. That is, workers sell their 
time on the job for money. Meanwhile, 
they are buyers in most other areas of 
their lives, purchasing food, coffee, video 
games, and other necessities and luxu-
ries. A business such as Starbucks is a 
seller in the market for premium cups of 
coffee—but it’s also a buyer of coffee 
beans, coffee cups, espresso machines, 
office computers, and the labor of its 
workers.
Local, National, and  
Global Markets
Buyers and sellers who are geographi-
cally close to each other are part of a 
local market. For example, certain per-
ishable food products like milk are gener-
ally sold in local markets (see “Spotlight: 
The Milk Market” on page 23). Dental 
services are typically local because you

­negotiation, after which different buyers may pay hundreds 
of dollars more or less for the same model car. Negotiated 
prices are more common in markets for big-ticket items 
like cars or homes.
In some markets, buyers may be offered a volume dis-
count, or a lower price for making a large purchase. For ex-
ample, a hospital may charge an individual patient one price 
for an operation such as an appendectomy. But insurance 
companies may be able to negotiate a much lower price for 
the identical procedure, based on the large volume of opera-
tions they pay for on behalf of their customers—firms and 
individuals who buy medical insurance.
In other markets, an advance purchase discount means 
that prices differ according to when purchases are made (see 
“Economic Milestone” on next page). In air travel, two iden-
tical seats on the same plane may sell for different prices de-
pending on how far ahead of the departure date the travelers 
purchased them. If you want to buy a ticket to a comic book 
conference, there’s often a cheaper price 
for people who register early.
HOW PRICE AFFECTS  
THE QUANTITY 
DEMANDED  LO2-2 
Some words in economics have mean-
ings different from ordinary usage. 
Usually, a demand refers to a forceful 
request, with the threat of conse-
quences if the request is not met. Bank 
robbers demand money; babies demand 
their bottles.
	
Demand in a market, though, is a 
gentler concept. The quantity de-
manded by a particular buyer is the 
amount that a buyer is willing to pur-
chase at a given price. For example, the 
weekly quantity demanded for gasoline 
at $3.00 per gallon is the amount a con-
sumer is willing to buy at that price 
over a week.
	
To really understand a market, 
though, it’s not enough to know what 
consumers are buying today. We also 
need to know what would happen to 
quantity demanded if the 
price of a good or service 
went up or down. In the 
market for gasoline, for 
example, it’s extremely 
important for government 
agencies and oil compa-
nies to know how much 
the quantity of gasoline 
SPOTLIGHT: THE MILK 
MARKET
When you drink a glass of milk, there is a good chance it 
hasn’t traveled more than a few ­hundred miles from the 
cow. Virtually every state has its own dairy industry, with 
distinctively named brands of milk from Shamrock Farms 
in Arizona to Trickling Springs Creamery in Pennsylva-
nia. As a result, the market for fluid milk is mainly local.
© S. Meltzer/PhotoLink/Getty Images
In theory, refrigerated milk could be safely shipped 
much farther than current distribution ­patterns. But a 
complicated set of government ­regulations—in place 
since the 1930s—discourages but does not prohibit 
long-distance shipments of fluid milk.
In contrast, the market for dairy products such as 
cheese and butter is clearly global. The butter you put 
on a piece of bread may have come from as far away as 
New Zealand, and the cheese you eat may have come 
from France or even from Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Poland.
	
That’s why we define the market price as the typical price 
at which a good or service sells in a market. In many cases the 
price for a good or service may be obvious and easy to iden-
tify. For ­example, the covers of most newspapers and maga-
zines list their newsstand prices.
	
But sometimes, identifying the price of a good or ser-
vice is not as easy as reading it off a printed list. Sellers 
are always adjusting their prices to pull in more custom-
ers. A sale price, for example, is intentionally 
set below the market price to stimulate 
purchases.
	
Then there are negotiated prices, which 
are determined by individual buyer and seller

demanded will increase if the price 
drops from $3.00 a gallon to $2.00 a 
gallon or even lower, all other things 
being equal.
The link between a buyer’s quantity 
demanded and the price is called the de-
mand schedule. For example, consider 
how many songs a person—call him 
Sam—might download from an online 
music site in a month. If the price is 
$0.50 per song, Sam might download 20 
songs and try out some unusual ones. If 
the price is $2.00 per song, Sam might 
download only the three songs he really 
likes. At $4.00 a song, Sam might de-
cide not to download any songs.
Table 2.1 shows what Sam’s demand 
schedule might look like. The first col-
umn is the price per song, and the sec-
ond column is the number of songs Sam 
would be willing to buy at that price.
	
In theory, we can build a demand schedule for every pos-
sible good or service that someone could buy. For example, 
your demand schedule for basketball tickets would reveal 
how many basketball games you might attend over the next 
year, depending on the price. Even if you are a vegetarian, 
we could construct your demand schedule for hamburgers. It 
would show zero quantity demanded at every price because 
no matter how low the price of hamburgers, you wouldn’t 
buy any.
	
The market demand schedule sums the demand sched-
ules for all the individual buyers in a market. So the market 
demand schedule in a town for hamburgers, for example, 
tells us how many hamburgers will be bought by the people 
in that town at any given price. That includes vegetarians 
who never buy hamburgers and people who eat a cheese-
burger every day for lunch.
	
One final note: When we think about a demand schedule 
for a market, we are implicitly assuming that everything 
else about the buying situation stays the same when the 
price changes. For example, the market demand schedule 
for basketball tickets assumes that key factors like the qual-
ity of the team, the cost of the concessions, and the ease of 
traveling to the arena don’t change when the price goes up 
or down. This assumption is called ceteris paribus—Latin 
for “all other things equal.” Economists often use this sim-
plifying strategy to determine the effect of a single change 
on a complex system.
The Law of Demand
When a local supermarket wants to bring in more shoppers, 
it advertises a sale—lower prices for detergent, say, or for 
lamb chops. And when Ford wants to attract more buyers for 
its cars or SUVs, it lowers its prices or offers rebates. The 
sellers expect that a lower price will increase the quantity 
demanded.
	
Alternatively, as the price of a good or service goes up, 
some people will simply stop buying the item, especially if it 
is a luxury and not a necessity. For example, if the price of a 
basketball ticket goes up enough, some people will simply 
cut basketball games out of their budgets and stop going.
	
Generally speaking, the lower the price, the greater the 
quantity demanded. This relationship between price and 
quantity demanded is known as the law of demand. Here’s a 
good way to think about it: If the price of a good goes up, you 
look at your spending and ask yourself, “Is this the best use 
of my money?” If it’s not, you spend a little bit less on the 
item that has gone up in price, and a little bit more on some-
thing else.
	
Suppose you drink three cups of coffee a day at $1 a cup. 
The local coffee vendor raises the price of a cup of coffee to 
$1.50 a cup. Now you have to ask yourself whether that third 
cup of coffee is still worth it, or whether you want to spend 
that $1.50 on a pack of gum or a piece of fruit. The principle

works on a bigger scale as well. If tuition per class goes up, 
you may cut back on the number of college courses you take 
at a time.
	 Keep in mind that the law of demand is a 
general tendency, not an ironclad rule. In 
some cases, rising prices will increase de-
mand. For example, when the prices of 
homes in a city are rising rapidly, buyers 
sometimes feel that they have to jump in 
quickly before the prices go even higher. 
Conversely, when the prices of homes start to 
fall in a market, buyers sometimes hold back 
from purchases hoping that home prices will 
decline further. However, despite such ex-
ceptions, you can usually expect that demand 
will fall as prices rise, and vice versa. 
The Special Case of Zero Price
Economists will be the first people to tell 
you that there’s no such thing as a free 
lunch. And, in fact, almost everything in life 
seems to come with a price tag attached. 
But there actually are a few products that 
come with a zero price so that you can get 
an additional unit of a good or service at no 
extra charge.
There is no trick. In today’s technology-
based economy, we consume plenty of 
goods and services in unlimited quantities 
without paying anything beyond an initial 
fee. For example, most cable television plans 
allow you to watch as many shows as you 
want without paying extra, and many cell 
phone plans offer unlimited calling to other 
cell phones on the same network. Similarly, 
at least for now, most broadband Internet 
plans to your home allow you to connect for 
as long as you want for a fixed monthly 
charge (though virtually all mobile data 
plans do charge more if you go above a cer-
tain amount of data used during the month).
Zero prices sometimes occur outside the 
technology sector as well. Some restaurants 
offer unlimited refills on coffee, and all-you-
can-eat buffets are not uncommon. So if the 
price is zero, why don’t you consume an in-
finite amount?
First, you generally 
reach satiation at some 
point, meaning that 
eventually the value to 
you of consuming any 
more of the good disap-
pears. You can drink 
only so much free coffee at one sitting 
before you get full or you start to shake 
from too much caffeine.
Not even Apple, the creator of the iPhone, can break the law of demand. 
When Apple released the first iPhone in June 2007, the new phone was 
universally acknowledged as a great breakthrough. Still, it sold for a stun-
ning $599—beyond the budget of most people. Two months later, Apple 
reduced the price to $399. The result? Demand jumped. At the higher 
price, Apple sold just under a million iPhones, or about 14,000 per day. 
But after the price cut, average sales over the next 4 months were 
20,000–25,000 per day. The price cut may not have been the only 
­reason for the increase in sales, but it certainly helped.
© leonardo255/123RF 
	
When Apple announced the price cut, many people who had rushed  
to buy iPhones at the earlier higher price felt cheated. As a result, Steve 
Jobs, then CEO of Apple, was forced to write a letter on Apple’s website 
apologizing and offering a $100 credit to those who had bought the 
phone at the higher price.

This demand schedule represents how many cups of coffee 
Sally will want to buy in a week, depending on the price.
There’s another consideration as well. 
Many products and services require some 
time to consume. For example, if you are 
sitting in front of the television, you are 
not doing something else like taking a 
walk, going to the mall, or spending time 
with friends. And no matter how adept you are at multitasking, 
you cannot talk on the cell phone while you are sleeping.
In other words, even at a zero price there’s an opportu-
nity cost to consuming more of a good or service if it re-
quires some of your time. In doing one thing, you are giving 
up the opportunity to do something else. In a world in which 
there are only 24 hours to the day, that’s a real cost. So the 
opportunity cost of watching television is not zero; it’s the 
value to you of the other activities you could be doing in-
stead. Your long-distance calls on your cell phone may be 
free, but if you spend all your time on the phone, you are not 
studying for exams, earning money at work, or taking a walk 
in the park. Such trade-offs will limit how much you con-
sume, even at a zero price.
	
Opportunity cost is an important concept in economics. 
In general, the opportunity cost of a choice or action is 
­defined as the value or benefit of the next best alternative. 
This embodies the basic principle that individuals have to 
choose between different uses of their time and money. 
We’ll meet this idea again.
Graphing the Demand Curve
Now let’s look at the demand schedule for coffee consump-
tion in a week for an individual—call her Sally. For many 
people, drinking a cup of coffee is an essential part of their 
day. However, one principle of economics is that even the 
demand for necessities responds to price.
	
In Table 2.2, the first column is the price per cup, and the 
second column is the number of cups demanded during the 
week. For example, if the price is $1.00 per cup, Sally may 
consume 18 cups per week. But if she must pay $5 a cup, 
she will ­restrict herself to only six cups a week.
	
This demand schedule for coffee can be represented visu-
ally on a graph (shown as Figure 2.1). ­Going up the vertical

Suppose you were running a record company. You 
want to sell music online, but how much should you 
charge for each song? $0.99? $0.75? $1.50?
	
Obviously the answer to this question depends on 
how many songs will be purchased at each price—the 
market demand schedule. For example, if the quantity 
demanded drops little when the price goes from $0.99 
to $1.50, then it makes sense to charge the higher price.
	
But knowing the demand schedule for a market is 
often not easy, especially with a new product. One way 
to uncover a demand schedule is to survey consumers 
and ask them how much they would pay for a new 
product. Companies regularly show new products to 
groups of selected people and ask their opinions. The 
problem, though, is that consumers may say they highly 
value a product and then spend their money on some-
thing else.
	
For established products, one way to see a ­demand 
schedule is to actually look at how much consumers 
buy at various prices. This is most useful for widely 
used products, like gasoline, where economists can re-
view how buyers have reacted to past price increases 
in order to predict the ­response to future price in-
creases or decreases.
HOW IT WORKS: 
UNCOVERING THE DEMAND 
SCHEDULE
axis of the graph are the different prices Sally could pay. Go-
ing across the horizontal axis of the graph are the different 
quantities she could demand. To plot the demand schedule on 
the graph, we start from a price on the vertical axis and 
move right until we get to the corresponding quantity.
We do this for every price, and then we connect the points 
in a line, called a demand curve. The demand curve shows 
the link between price and quantity demanded. It is the 
graphical counterpart to the demand schedule.
For example, when the price is $2 per cup, the quantity 
demanded is 15 cups. So we find that price on the vertical 
axis, and go from left to right until we reach 15 cups per 
week (point A on graph). That becomes a point on the de-
mand curve. Next, when the price is $3 per cup, 
the quantity demanded is 12 cups. We find the 
price $3 on the vertical axis and move right un-
til we reach 12 cups (point B).
The result is known as a downward-­
sloping ­demand curve because the curve we 
plotted from our data starts at the top left side 
of the graph and slopes downward to the 
right. The law of demand suggests that most 
demand curves will slope downward because price in-
creases reduce the quantities demanded, all other things 
being equal.
HOW PRICE AFFECTS THE 
QUANTITY SUPPLIED  LO2-3 
Now we turn our attention to the supply side of markets. 
Let’s start by looking at the market for new homes. In 2000, 
the average sale price of a new single-family house in the 
United States was $207,000. By 2005, the average sale price 
of a new single-family home had risen to $297,000, a big 
jump in only 5 years. 
How did home builders react to this enor-
mous increase in the price of their product? 
They began constructing a lot more houses in 
every part of the country. The pace was fre-
netic: In 2005, home builders started almost 
1.7 million new homes, up from 1.2 million in 
2000. With prices so high, they built homes 
wherever they could find the space—even in 
the middle of deserts. 
The process worked in reverse as well. When housing 
prices began to plummet in 2007, it became a lot less worth-
while for home builders to put up new homes. By 2009, new 
home construction had almost completely dried up. Then 
when prices for homes in most parts of the country started to 
rebound, so did the pace of home construction.
	
In any market, the quantity supplied 
by a particular seller is the amount of 
goods and services that the seller is 
willing to provide at a given price. As 
the price changes, the quantity sup-
plied changes as well. The supply 
schedule for a good or service reports 
the quantity supplied at different sell-
ing prices.
	
Let’s think about the supply sched-
ule for women’s haircuts. A hair salon 
hires hairstylists, who are available to 
shape, trim, and dry the hair of anyone 
who walks through the door. For sim-
plicity, assume it takes an hour to give a 
good haircut. So the quantity supplied 
of haircuts at any price in this market is 
determined by the number of hairstyl-
ists employed.
	
Notice that the quantity supplied of 
haircuts can exceed the quantity de-
manded. What does this mean? The 
stylists may spend part of the day not 
giving haircuts but reading the newspa-
per next to an empty chair or sweeping 
the floor while waiting for customers.

Demand and Supply: The Basics of the Market Economy
Suppose the market price of a haircut goes up. That will 
make it more attractive for a hair salon to hire more stylists. It 
will also increase the willingness of would-be entrepreneurs 
to open up their own businesses. But if the price goes down, 
haircutting will be less profitable; some hairstylists will be let 
go or be given reduced hours; and some existing salons may 
close. The quantity supplied will drop along with the price. 
This is part of the natural ebb and flow of markets.
But as long as they are available if and 
when someone comes in wanting a 
haircut, their time at work is part of the 
supply of haircuts.
	
Let’s take a look at a hypothetical 
supply schedule for Helen’s Haircut-
ting ­Salon, as shown in Table 2.3. At a 
price of $5, there are only 40 haircuts 
available per week, with perhaps one 
hairstylist working full-time. As the 
price per haircut rises, however, run-
ning a hair salon becomes much more 
lucrative. At $10 per haircut, the num-
ber of haircuts available is 60 (perhaps because the existing 
stylist works extra hours during the week). As the price 
rises further, more people are put to work. At $35 per 
­haircut, 160 haircuts are available, which ­reflects employ-
ment of perhaps four stylists, each working a 40-hour week 
and taking 1 hour for each haircut.
	
The market supply schedule adds up the quantity sup-
plied by all the sellers in a market. For example, suppose 
there are 10 haircutting salons in a town, all with the same 
supply schedule as Table 2.3. Then, if the price per haircut 
is $20, there will be a total of 1,000 haircuts supplied 
(100 haircuts × 10 stores).
The Law of Supply
The law of supply says that higher prices tend to increase the 
quantity supplied of a good or service, assuming nothing else 
changes. If the price a business can get for its goods and ser-
vices rises, it has an incentive to increase production. There 
are plenty of ways to do that. It can hire more workers; it can 
have existing workers put in longer hours; it can open up a 
new store or a new factory; it can buy new computers or new 
machinery to beef up its productive capabilities.

SPOTLIGHT: THE GREAT 
ETHANOL BOOM
In 2005, the federal government mandated that most 
gasoline sold in the United States had to contain some 
ethanol alcohol, a fuel that is usually made from corn. In 
2007, that requirement was increased, with the goal of 
decreasing the country’s dependence on ­foreign oil.  
	
As a result, the demand for corn ethanol soared, and 
so did the demand for the corn used to make the ethanol. 
The price of corn skyrocketed as well, from roughly $2 
per bushel in 2005 to almost $5 per bushel in 2008.
	
Here’s where the law of supply came into effect. 
Farmers, the main suppliers of corn, ­responded to the 
rising price by increasing the quantity supplied. They 
planted more corn—a lot more corn. The result was the 
largest corn crop in history at the time.
	
Consumers were not happy about the higher price of 
corn, however. Not only was corn in the store more ex-
pensive, so was pork and beef, because pigs and cattle 
are often fed corn. The situation got even worse in 2012, 
when a drought hit the Midwest, cutting corn production 
and raising corn prices even higher. 
	
As of 2016, there was continuing debate about whether 
the government should reduce the ethanol mandate. If that 
happens, we would see the law of supply in action again. 
Less demand for ethanol would mean lower prices for corn, 
which would mean that farmers would switch to other 
crops, lessening the quantity supplied.

The market price per lawn determines the quantity of 
lawn-mowing services supplied. If the price is high, then 
teenagers tear themselves away from their video games and 
offer to mow their neighbors’ lawns, and landscape ser-
vices hire more workers.
Table 2.4 shows a hypothetical market supply schedule 
for the lawn-mowing market in a town. As the market price 
per lawn increases, so does the quantity supplied.
	
Now let’s plot this supply schedule on a graph (Fig-
ure 2.2). Going up the vertical axis are the various prices 
that could be charged per lawn. Going across the horizonal 
axis is the quantity supplied—the number of lawns mowed. 
To plot the supply schedule, we start with a price on the ver-
tical axis and move right horizontally until we come to the 
number of lawns mowed.
For example, if the market price is $10 per lawn, the sup-
ply schedule tells us that the quantity supplied is 15 mowed 
	
The law of supply operates in global markets as well. 
Suppose a department store chain is selling blue shirts im-
ported from China. If the price of that kind of shirt goes 
up—perhaps because men are dressing ­better—the depart-
ment store chain will order more shirts from its supplier in 
China. The ­Chinese factory will need a little time to respond 
because it must first hire more workers and train them. But 
higher prices will generally lead to an increase in the quan-
tity supplied, even though it may take a while.
	
A key market where the law of supply generally holds is 
the labor market. The price of labor is the wage rate—that is, 
the price per hour a worker gets paid. Generally speaking, a 
higher wage rate will not have much effect on the labor sup-
plied by people who are already working full-time. How-
ever, economic research generally shows that higher wages 
do increase the labor supply of people who are less commit-
ted to working, such as teenagers.
	
Like the law of demand, the law of supply does not hold 
true in every circumstance. In some cases, an increased price 
can lower supply. For example, suppose your goal is to work 
enough hours during a semester to pay your expenses—let’s 
say $2,000. If you earn $10 an hour, you will have to work 
200 hours to achieve your goal. But if you earn $20 an hour, 
it will take only 100 hours to earn enough to pay your ex-
penses—so a higher price for your labor will decrease, not 
increase, the amount of labor you supply. However, in most 
situations the law of supply does hold.
Graphing the Supply Schedule
Just as we plotted the demand schedule from Table 2.2 in 
Figure 2.1, we can plot the supply schedule for a market on a 
graph. Let’s think about a suburban town where home own-
ers hire other people to mow their lawns. They might be pay-
ing neighborhood teenagers or a landscape service.

As the price to mow a lawn rises, so does the quantity 
supplied. For example, if the going market price for mow-
ing a lawn in a town is $15, then suppliers make them-
selves available to mow 25 lawns.

Some goods and services we buy today were not available 
10, 20, or 30 years ago or were not available in the same 
form. We’re surrounded by new technologies and new 
­products—everything from the iPad to the latest product for 
hair straightening to remote-controlled drones. New types of 
services, too, have proliferated, such as web design—a new 
market that didn’t exist before the mid-1990s. New jobs are 
common as well, such as “social media manager,” “informa-
tion security specialist,” and “genetic counselor.”
	
New markets also arise as incomes rise in developing 
countries like China. For example, as recently as the early 
1990s, few families owned cars in China. But as the country 
grew richer and incomes soared, the market for automobiles 
in China went from minuscule to enormous almost 
overnight.
We will return to the notion of new markets 
in Chapters 13, 14, and 15 when we look at 
­financial markets, globalization, and techno-
logical change in more detail. For now, keep in 
mind that one of the biggest positives of a mar-
ket economy is its ability to adapt quickly to 
changing circumstances.
lawns. That’s point A in Figure 2.2. 
Plotting all the combinations of price 
and quantity supplied and connecting 
the points gives us the supply curve. 
The supply curve shows the link be-
tween the price and the quantity 
supplied.
The result is an upward-sloping 
supply curve that starts at the lower 
left corner and goes to the upper right 
corner of the graph. We have drawn it 
as a straight line, but real-world supply 
curves are generally not straight.

SUMMARY
	 1.	Markets are composed of buyers and sellers who ex-
change goods and services for money at a rate called 
the price. Markets can be local, national, or global. 
(LO2-1)
	 2.	A demand schedule describes the behavior of buyers in 
a market. For each price, the demand schedule reports 
the quantity demanded at that price. A demand curve is 
usually downward-sloping, which means that the quan-
tity demanded drops as the price increases. (LO2-2)
	 3.	A supply schedule describes the behavior of sellers in 
a market. For each price, the supply schedule reports 
the quantity supplied at that price. A supply curve is 
usually upward-sloping, which means that the quantity 
supplied increases as the price increases. (LO2-3)
	 4.	The number of markets is not fixed. New markets can 
provide new goods or services or bring in new buyers 
and sellers. (LO2-4)

prepared to consume. Then, we’ll ­outline 
the key concept of market equilibrium—
that special point where both buyers and 
sellers are satisfied and supply equals de-
mand. We’ll see how buyers and sellers 
react to events, or shifts, that can push 
markets away from equilibrium. Finally, 
we’ll discuss the basics of elasticity of 
­demand and supply, which tell us how 
much buyers and sellers react to changes 
in their economic environment.
T
he economy is always changing in 
ways large and small. Consider one 
month: January 2016. In that month, driv-
ers enjoyed declining gas prices, as the 
­average price of a gallon of gasoline fell 
below $2.00 nationally for the first time 
since 2009. Residents of New York, 
­Washington DC, and other East Coast cities 
dug out from a record-breaking snow-
storm. And the population of China grew 
by about 540,000 people.
	
Each of these events affected at least 
one market. American drivers spent less 
on filling up their cars with gasoline, leav-
ing them with more money to purchase 
food and entertainment. The blizzard 
boosted the demand for snow shovels 
and salt for sidewalks and roads. And the 
number of consumers in China rose, 
­affecting global demand.
	
In this chapter, we will look at how mar-
kets react to change. First, we’ll examine 
what might happen when buyers want more 
than sellers are prepared to produce or 
when sellers produce more than buyers are

country, customers are walking into stores 
and walking out unhappy because the dress 
or sneaker they wanted was out of stock. On 
the other hand, sometimes businesses spend 
millions advertising products—a new type 
of fitness gadget, perhaps—that no one 
wants to buy.
MATCHING SUPPLY  
AND DEMAND  LO3-1 
Recall from the previous chapter that markets 
have two sides: buyers and sellers. Each side 
makes decisions independently, so in theory, the 
amount buyers wish to purchase may be very dif-
ferent than the amount sellers wish to provide. But as we 
will see in this section, one of the great strengths of a market 
economy is that quantity demanded tends to roughly equal 
quantity supplied most of the time.
The Case of Excess Demand
A market has excess demand if buyers desire to purchase a 
greater quantity than sellers are prepared to supply at the 
current market price. In other words, quantity demanded ex-
ceeds quantity supplied at the current market price. During 
the housing boom of 2003–2006, home buyers in hot cities 
like Boston, New York, San Francisco, and San Diego lined 
up to make competing bids whenever a desirable property 
came on the market. Often, the final selling price of a home 
was higher than the original price it was listed for—a clear 
sign of excess demand.
The employment market for nurses also occasionally 
shows signs of excess demand in some regions. The combi-
nation of an aging population’s need for more medical care 
and health care providers’ unwillingness to raise nursing 
wages means hospitals sometimes have a hard time finding 
all the nurses they need.
The Case of Excess Supply
Other markets may suffer from excess supply when sup-
pliers are willing to sell more at the market price than 
buyers are prepared to pay for. Quantity supplied then 
­exceeds quantity demanded at the current market price. 
After the housing market collapsed in 2007, there were 
far more homes for sale than there were buyers in most 
parts of the country.
But it’s not just housing. If the restaurant around the 
corner from you has few customers for dinner—perhaps 
because it serves overpriced bad food—that’s a situation of 
excess supply. This is why thousands 
of restaurants go out of business each 
year. Similarly, changes in vacation or 
travel patterns can leave a formerly 
popular hotel with perpetually empty 
rooms (as we see in “Spotlight: Excess 
Supply on the Boardwalk”).
The Invisible Hand
Situations of excess demand and ex-
cess supply disappoint buyers and 
frustrate sellers. Every day around the 
SPOTLIGHT: EXCESS SUPPLY 
ON THE BOARDWALK
The first legal casino outside of Las Vegas opened in 
Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1978. Gamblers from both 
New York City and Philadelphia immediately flocked to 
the new casino in the seaside resort town, with its fa-
mous boardwalk. Very quickly, developers such as 
Donald Trump built more and more casino hotels to 
take advantage of the untapped demand for legal 
­gambling. To attract visitors to Atlantic City, the casinos 
staged high-profile boxing matches, featuring fighters 
like Mike Tyson. The town glittered.

But then Atlantic City began to face competition—first 
from casinos on Indian reservations in ­Connecticut and 
then from legalized gambling in nearby states such as 
Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and upstate New 
York. The number of visitors to Atlantic City peaked in 
2005 and 2006. When the national recession hit in 
2007, many hotel rooms in Atlantic City were left empty, 
and the amount gambled plunged. In the end, this situ-
ation of excess supply was partly resolved by the clo-
sure of four casinos in 2014.

difficult. Yet one of the truly distin-
guishing features of a market econ-
omy is that eventually the forces of 
supply and demand are enough to 
overcome such inertia and restore the 
balance.
	
The price at which the quantity sup-
plied equals the quantity demanded is 
the equilibrium price. At 
the equilibrium price, 
there’s a match between 
how much buyers want 
and how much sellers are 
willing to supply: the 
equilibrium quantity, 
which is the quantity sup-
plied and demanded at the 
market price. For exam-
ple, the market for hotel 
rooms would be at equi-
librium if all hotel rooms were filled, 
but there were no potential guests 
standing outside in the cold with no 
place to sleep.
In the real world, few markets are 
exactly at the equilibrium price. 
There might be some excess demand 
or some excess supply. However, 
most markets, left to their own de-
vices, will tend toward the equilib-
rium price that balances supply and 
demand. As a result, most markets 
either are near equilibrium or are try-
ing to get there.
MARKET MECHANISM
The process by  
which a market 
reaches equilibrium 
without a central  
planner. See  
invisible hand.
INVISIBLE HAND
A term to describe a 
situation in which indi-
vidual actions of buy-
ers and sellers tend to 
result in a positive  
social outcome.
MARKET EQUILIBRIUM
A situation in which 
the quantity supplied 
and the quantity de-
manded in a specified 
market are equal. See 
equilibrium price and 
equilibrium quantity.
EQUILIBRIUM PRICE
The price at which the 
quantity supplied in a 
market equals the 
quantity demanded.
EQUILIBRIUM  
QUANTITY
The quantity corre-
sponding to the equi-
librium price. At that 
price, there’s a match 
between what buyers 
want and what sellers 
are willing to supply.
How do markets react to a gap between quantity sup-
plied and quantity demanded? The difference between 
the two is usually closed by what economists call the 
market mechanism—or, more poetically, the invisible 
hand.
	
The reason the mechanism is “invisible” is that no central 
planning agency has to issue explicit orders to close the sup-
ply–demand gap; buyers and sellers act on their own. Excess 
supply usually puts downward pressure on prices. For ex-
ample, when retailers have too many shirts or big-screen 
televisions in their store, or too many new cars in the lot, 
they run a sale. Motels with spare rooms offer them at cut-
rate prices to tour operators or online resellers. Hair salons 
may trim their prices by offering newspaper coupons or spe-
cials on coloring.
	
A lower price simultaneously increases the quantity de-
manded and reduces the quantity supplied. A reduced price 
for hotel rooms, say, increases quantity demanded by en-
couraging tourists to stay longer and enticing local parents 
to take a quick weekend break from their kids rather than 
just going out to eat. The lower price also eventually de-
creases the quantity supplied of hotel rooms. Fewer new  
hotels get built, and some existing ones may go out of busi-
ness or get turned into apartments.
	
Similarly, excess demand usually puts upward pressure 
on prices. Just like a price decline, a price increase affects 
both buyers and sellers. It decreases the quantity de-
manded by buyers, who buy less or substitute cheaper 
goods. At the same time, a higher price is a lure for sellers 
to increase production and add capacity by 
building a new store or a new factory. When 
there is excess demand in the real estate mar-
ket, several people bid for the same house, 
and the price rises. The high selling prices of 
homes in 2004, 2005, and 2006 led to the con-
struction and sale of a record number of new 
single-family houses because builders could 
sell new homes at a high price just as fast as 
they could put them up. Then in 2014 and 
2015, high rents for apartments led to builders 
putting up a rising number of buildings with 
multiple units. 
MARKET EQUILIBRIUM  LO3-2 
Left to themselves, most markets will eventually reach a 
market equilibrium, where the quantity supplied and the 
quantity demanded are equal. Prices move up or down, 
buyers change the quantity they demand, and sellers adjust 
the quantity they supply. True, the process of adjustment 
may be stop-and-go (prices may go up and down and then 
up again), and it may take a long time, perhaps years. Con-
sumers and businesses get accustomed to their routines 
and the way they’ve done things in the past, and change is 
Sometimes, home builders overestimate the demand for new 
homes, leaving some new homes empty.

Equilibrium in Numbers
Sticking to the theme of vehicles, let’s look at a numerical 
example of market equilibrium. Think about the market for 
go-karts—small, gasoline-powered vehicles that look like the 
one pictured here. Made today mostly by Asian companies, 
they range in price from roughly $500 to over $2,000, with a 
maximum speed of 35 to 40 miles per hour. Some are made 
for kids; some are driven by adults in go-kart races (including 
“endurance karting,” where the races can last up to 24 hours).
	
Both the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded of 
go-karts are sensitive to price. On the demand side, go-karts 
are strictly a discretionary purchase; if the price rises too 
The Basic Supply–Demand Diagram
We can depict the market equilibrium by drawing the market 
supply and ­demand curves on the same graph. The price at 
which the two lines intersect is the equilibrium price. At that 
price, quantity supplied is equal to quantity demanded: the 
equilibrium quantity.
	
Figure 3.1 is perhaps the most famous—and useful—dia-
gram in economics. In this figure, the equilibrium price is P, 
and the equilibrium quantity is Q. Think about it this way: 
buyers and sellers make decisions independently from each 
other. However, at the equilibrium price, it happens that the 
quantity picked by suppliers is equal to the quantity chosen 
by sellers.
	
To make the idea of market equilibrium a bit more 
concrete, let’s look at the market for new motor vehicles. 
We know that the demand curve for motor vehicles is 
downward-sloping because consumers will buy more 
cars, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and other vehicles if 
they are less expensive. And the supply curve for vehicles 
is upward-sloping: if dealers can get more money for each 
car or SUV, manufacturers hire more workers, run the as-
sembly lines longer, or bring in more vehicles from 
overseas.
	
Figure 3.2 illustrates the 2014 market equilibrium in 
the new car and light truck market. At an average price 
of $32,600, vehicle manufacturers were willing to sup-
ply 16.4 million vehicles to the market. At the same 
price level, buyers were willing to shell out enough 
money to take home 16.4 million vehicles. Quantity 
supplied and quantity demanded are equal, making this 
an equilibrium.

much, buyers will put off the purchase. On the supply side, 
the same Asian factories that make go-karts can also make a 
wide range of other products, including small scooters and 
golf carts. That makes it easy to switch workers to making 
more go-karts if their price should rise—or to making other 
products if the price of go-karts should suddenly drop.
	
Table 3.1 shows hypothetical market supply and 
­demand schedules for the go-kart market; the left column 
of the table lists the price per go-kart. For any price, if you 
read across the table, the second column reports the quan-
tity demanded at that price, and the third column reports 
the quantity supplied. For example, if the price per go-kart 
is $800, the market quantity demanded is 5,500 go-karts 
and the market quantity supplied is 3,500. In other words, 
we have a situation of excess demand: More people want 
go-karts than are able to get them at the going price. But if 
the price is $1,800 per go-kart, the quantity demanded is 
3,000 go-karts and the amount supplied is 6,000 go-karts: 
a situation of excess supply. Producers are willing to make 
more go-karts at this price than buyers are willing to 
purchase.
	
The equilibrium for this market, as for every market, oc-
curs at the price where quantity demanded equals quantity 
supplied. For this example, the equilibrium price is $1,200, 
where both quantity supplied and quantity demanded equal 
4,500 go-karts.
	
We can also draw the corresponding supply and demand 
curves on a graph, just as we did in Chapter 2. Look at Fig-
ure 3.3. The upward-sloping line is the market supply

curve. For example, start at a price of $1,600 per go-kart 
and move right. The first line we run into is the demand 
curve, which shows a demand of 3,500 go-karts at this 
price. If we keep going right, we run into the supply curve 
at 5,500 go-karts.
	
On the diagram, we can immediately identify the point A

Market Equilibrium and Shifts
­clothing to the United States. The increase in imports means 
the supply curve for clothing shifted to the right, as Figure 3.5 
shows. For any given price, more clothing is supplied.
Demand Shifts and Market Equilibrium
A market shift will change the market equilibrium. After a 
market experiences a demand or supply shift, it eventually 
finds a new equilibrium. For example, if the demand curve 
shifts to the left—as in the case of the market for 
music CDs—that will temporarily create a situa-
tion of excess supply, which tends to drive down 
the price until a new equilibrium is reached.
Looking at Figure 3.6, we see that the original 
equilibrium in the music CD market was at point 
A, where the pre-Internet demand curve and the 
supply curve cross. When music downloads re-
duced demand for CDs, the demand curve shifted 
to the left and the equilibrium shifted to point B, with a lower 
price and a lower quantity supplied and demanded.
Supply Shifts and Market Equilibrium
Let’s look now at the impact of a supply shift on market 
equilibrium. Suppose the supply curve shifts to the right, as 
in the case of the clothing market. That will temporarily cre-
ate a situation of excess supply, which tends to drive down 
the price until a new equilibrium is reached.
	
Looking at Figure 3.7, we see that the original equilib-
rium in the clothing market was at point A, where the 
­original supply and demand curves cross. The combination 
of fewer restrictions on clothing imports and improved 
manufacturing capabilities overseas caused the supply curve 
MARKET SHIFTS  LO3-3 
Markets are continually being bombarded by outside 
forces, large and small, that affect buyers or sellers or 
both. As one example, the once-huge market for music 
compact disks (CDs) was dramatically affected by the 
­expansion of the Internet. When songs became widely avail-
able online, potential music purchasers could download de-
sired songs for a low price. Now individuals can sign up for 
a “music-streaming” service such as Spotify or 
Apple Music, which gives access to millions of 
songs at a fixed monthly fee. As a result, music 
lovers are buying fewer and fewer music CDs, 
even if the average price 
of the CD didn’t change.
Economists call the 
changes caused by such 
forces market shifts. A 
demand shift is a market shift that af-
fects buyers, changing the amount buy-
ers want to purchase at any given price. 
For example, when music became 
widely available online, the demand 
curve for music CDs shifted to the left, 
as Figure 3.4 shows.
Similarly, a supply shift affects sell-
ers, either raising or  lowering the 
amount they supply at any given price. 
For example, a loosening of restrictions 
on clothing imports, combined with im-
proved manufacturing capabilities, has 
allowed countries like China, Vietnam, 
and Indonesia to ship a lot more

An Example of an Increase in Demand
Let’s look at a demand shift in a market that few people 
think much about: the market for cement. Cement, a pow-
dery mixture, is used to make concrete for construction ev-
erywhere around the world. Starting around 2004 or so, 
there was a dramatic construction boom in China—factories, 
office buildings, apartment buildings, and highways. This 
surge in Chinese construction moved the global demand 
curve for cement to the right (see the arrow in Figure 3.8) 
to shift to the right. The new equilibrium is at point B, with 
a lower price of clothing and a higher quantity supplied and 
demanded.
	
Even though these supply and demand curves are hypo-
thetical, they accurately convey what happened. Between 
2000 and 2015 the average price of clothing and footwear 
fell by 5 percent, even while the prices of all sorts of other 
goods and services were rising. Meanwhile, American con-
sumers dramatically increased their purchases of clothing 
over this stretch.

the equilibrium labeled A. The aver-
age national price of gasoline was 
$2.36 in July 2005. After the hurri-
cane, the supply curve for gasoline 
shifted to the left. That is, at the same 
price, the quantity of gasoline sup-
plied fell. As a result, the new equilib-
rium price was much higher. In 
September 2005 the average price of 
gasoline was $2.97. 
Shifts versus Movements
So far in this section, we’ve considered several different 
examples of changing markets. In two of these examples—
the market for clothing and the market for cement—the 
equilibrium quantity increased. In the other two of these 
examples—the market for gasoline and the market for mu-
sic CDs—the equilibrium quantity decreased. Yet the rea-
son was different in each case.
	
In the clothing example, the equilibrium quantity in-
creased because the supply curve shifted and the demand 
curve stayed the same. This is an example of a movement 
along a demand curve. You can see in Figure 3.7, on page 
42, that the equilibrium just slides along the demand curve 
from A to B as the supply shifts.
On the other hand, in the cement example, the equilib-
rium quantity increased because the demand curve shifted 
and the supply curve stayed the same. This is an example of 
a movement along a supply curve. You can see in Figure 
3.8, on page 42, from that the equilibrium just slides along 
the supply curve A to B as the demand shifts.
demanded was Q. Everyone was getting their needs met: 
The buyers of ­cement—construction companies—were get-
ting enough to fulfill their needs, and the sellers of cement 
were keeping their plants running.
	
After China started exerting its cement-buying muscles, 
the demand curve shifted to the right. The new equilibrium 
point B—where the old supply curve crosses the new ­demand 
curve—has a higher price and a higher quantity Q′. A de-
mand shift to the right generally leads to higher prices and 
eventually higher output. And, in fact, that’s what happened.
	
Remember that excess demand in a market creates pres-
sure to raise prices. So higher prices encouraged cement 
producers to build new cement manufacturing plants in the 
United States and around the world.
	
Indeed, China built many cement production facilities 
and actually began exporting cement. In fact, Chinese ce-
ment helped to rebuild New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina 
nearly destroyed the city in August 2005. 
An Example of a Decrease in Supply
When Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in 2005, it 
closed down refineries and oil rigs both onshore and in the 
Gulf of Mexico. As a result, the price of gasoline jumped 
almost instantaneously around the country. Newspapers 
wrote about service stations boosting prices by $1 or more 
per gallon within a short period. In New Jersey, the state at-
torney general charged 20 gas stations with violating a 1938 
law prohibiting them from raising prices more than once in a 
24-hour period.
	
Figure 3.9 shows the impact of Hurricane Katrina on 
the gasoline market. Before Katrina hit, the market was at

Market Equilibrium and Shifts
Technological Change
We already mentioned the impact of the Internet on the de-
mand for music CDs. Historically some of the biggest mar-
ket shifts have been created by technological breakthroughs. 
Looking back a century, Henry Ford introduced the first 
mass-produced automobile, the Model T, in 1913. That 
caused the supply curve for automobiles to shift dramati-
cally to the right, driving down prices and boosting quanti-
ties sold. Because his factories were so productive, Ford 
could sell cars for under $300 each—far less than the 
$1,000 his competitors were charging. (In Chapter 8, we 
will learn how to adjust historical prices for inflation. A car 
sold for $300 in 1913 would cost the equivalent of about 
$5,000 today—still not expensive.) The dramatically lower 
prices for cars enabled many more families to afford them, 
so the shift in the supply curve led to a movement along the 
demand curve.
Of course, we don’t have to look back a hundred years to 
see technology-driven shifts. When the Internet first starting 
becoming popular in the early 1990s, customers had to pay 
high hourly rates for a very slow dial-up connection. Since 
then, the supply of telecommunications services has been rap-
idly shifting to the right, in part because of advances in com-
munications technology and in part because of hundreds of 
billions of dollars of investment by telecom companies. As a 
result, the price of an online connection, measured as the cost 
per unit of data transferred, has dropped sharply. 
Globalization
By introducing new buyers and sellers into a market, global-
ization can create shifts on either the demand or supply side 
of a market, or both. We already mentioned the 
impact of China on cement demand and the im-
pact of China and other countries on the supply 
of clothing. Now let’s consider the impact of 
globalization on the supply of furniture. Be-
tween 2000 and 2007, U.S. furniture companies 
started making more furniture in China because 
	
The music CD market is also an example of a movement 
along a supply curve, as the demand curve shifts to the left 
(Figure 3.6). And the gasoline market after Katrina is an ex-
ample of a movement along a demand curve, as the supply 
curve shifts to the left (Figure 3.9).
SOME CAUSES OF MARKET 
SHIFTS  LO3-4 
We’ve now seen several examples of how supply and de-
mand shifts can affect market equilibrium. Table 3.2 sum-
marizes the impacts, which depend on whether the 
demand or supply curve is shifting, and in which direc-
tion it shifts.
In fact, many economic changes can be 
­described in terms of shifts in supply and 
­demand, including the key forces driving today’s 
economy, described in Chapter 1: technological 
change, ­globalization, and the evolution of 
­financial markets. Other major causes of market 
shifts include changes in the prices of raw mate-
rials and changes in tastes. Let’s look at these.

Finally, market shifts can also be 
caused by changes in loan standards. 
During the housing boom, lenders 
­offered “easy credit” for mortgages, 
car loans, and credit cards, making it 
easier for many Americans to borrow 
even if they didn’t have much income. 
These easy loan standards helped shift 
the demand curve for houses, motor 
vehicles, and many other purchases to the right. The result 
was higher quantities purchased. Then, during the Great 
Recession and afterward, financial institutions tightened 
up on their standards for lending, making it harder for a 
few years to get mortgages and other loans, so demand 
curves shifted to the left.
Government Action
Any type of government action—such as the creation of new 
rules that businesses or consumers have to follow—can 
cause a significant market shift, changing supply and de-
mand in a market almost overnight. For example, if a state 
legislature passes a law requiring that drivers use child 
safety seats or booster seats for passengers through age 7 (as 
New Jersey did in 2001), the demand curve for child car 
seats and booster seats immediately shifts to the right. Simi-
larly, if a state requires that hands-free headsets be used for 
cell phones while people drive, that shifts the demand curve 
for headsets to the right.
	
Government action can also affect the supply side of 
markets. Suppose a town decides to change its land use 
regulations—say, by requiring builders to leave 100 feet 
it was considerably less expensive to produce there. As a 
result, the supply curve for furniture shifted to the right. The 
price of dining room and living room furniture dropped, and 
the amount of furniture purchased by American households 
increased, as we will see in Chapter 5.
Changes in Financial Markets
One important cause of market shifts is a change in the cost 
of borrowing money. Most of us don’t have enough cash on 
hand to pay for the car or home we want or to pay for our 
education. So we take out loans—auto loans, home mort-
gages, education loans. The price of a loan is its interest 
rate, which says how much we have to pay the lender in ex-
change for the use of the money. For example, a 5 percent 
annual interest rate means we owe the lender an extra 5 per-
cent of the original loan value (the amount we borrowed) in 
return for using the money for a year. (Interest rates and 
loans are discussed further in Chapter 13.)
	
If interest rates rise, then cars, homes, and education be-
come harder to pay for. So higher interest rates mean we per-
haps stick with our old houses or cars for a while, or we go 
to school only part-time. In other words, a rise in interest 
rates causes demand to decline: the demand curve for autos, 
homes, or education shifts to the left.
	
Figure 3.10 shows the result of an increase in interest 
rates on auto loans. At any price for cars, the quantity de-
manded falls because potential customers are paying more 
for their loans. The result is that the equilibrium quantity 
falls, and so does the price. We’d see the same basic pattern 
in other markets in which many consumers use loans to buy 
a product or service (like education and housing).

has to pay a lender

which will affect temperature and rainfall patterns in differ-
ent parts of the world. By some estimates, global warming 
may reduce food production in countries near the tropics, 
which are already hot. Areas that start off cooler—such as 
the northern United States, Canada, and ­Russia—may see a 
shift to the right in the supply of grain and other agricultural 
products. (The economic implications of environmental 
change and global warming are explored more deeply in 
Chapter 19.)
Shifts in Tastes
Often markets are rocked by nothing more or less than a shift 
in tastes—that is, an unexplained shift in the consumer de-
mand curves for various products and services. One day real-
ity shows are all the rage; the next day television viewers don’t 
care for them. If every family needs a minivan today, next year 
minivans may be completely out of fashion. One month kids 
may want a certain brand of clothing; the next month they’re 
onto something else.
	
Businesses learn to live with these essentially unpredict-
able changes. In some industries, like fashion and entertain-
ment, the whole game is to catch these shifts in taste as they 
occur. But changes in consumer tastes also regularly affect 
more mundane industries such as food. (See “How It Works: 
The Fall of the Red Delicious Apple.”)
THE EFFECT OF INCOME  
ON DEMAND  LO3-5 
One important influence on demand deserves special 
­attention: income. A family earning $50,000 a year will 
have a very different demand curve than one earning 
$500,000 a year. For most goods and services, an increase 
in income will shift a family’s demand curve to the right. 
For example, at price P a low-income household might 
consume Q of a good. But the demand curve for a high-
income household is shifted to the right, so 
their quantity demanded is higher at Q′, as 
Figure 3.11 shows.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks con-
sumer spending by households with different 
income levels. For every major category of 
consumption—food, clothing, housing, trans-
portation, health care, and entertainment—
higher-income households spend more.
But if we look more closely within the spending catego-
ries, it’s not simply that high-income families buy more; 
their whole pattern of consumption is different. For exam-
ple, a family earning $50,000 a year might own a modest 
used car and a small house and eat out at the local pizzeria. 
Does a family earning 10 times as much own 10 modest 
used cars and 10 small houses and order 10 pizzas a week? 
Of course not—that would be absurd.
between new homes rather than only 10 feet. 
That causes the supply curve for new homes in 
that town to shift left because now fewer 
homes than before can be built on the same 
amount of land.
Changes in Raw Material Prices
Shifts in the price of raw materials can be a major 
cause of supply shifts across a wide range of markets. Frost can 
wipe out an orange crop, shifting the sup-
ply curve to the left and driving orange 
prices up. Discovery of a major new oil 
field in Africa would cause the oil supply 
curve to shift to the right.
One important future cause of sup-
ply shifts may be global climate change, 
Go to your local grocery store, and you might see 20 
different varieties of apples, from Granny Smith and Gala 
to Jazz, Cameo, and Pacific Rose. It wasn’t that way a 
few years ago. Red Delicious apples—bright, firm, and 
easy to store—used to be the clear favorites. As recently 
as 1998, Red Delicious apples ­accounted for 40 per-
cent of all the apples ­produced in the United States.
	
The problem was that consumers found them taste-
less. Growers had spent years breeding Red Delicious 
apples that looked good and stood up well to shipping—
but lost flavor in the process. “They eventually went too 
far and ended up with apples the public didn’t want to 
eat,” Lee Calhoun, an apple historian, told the Washing-
ton Post in 2005. The Red Delicious “is an apple that has 
done its duty and is on its way out.”
	
With consumers tiring of the Red Delicious, the de-
mand curve for that variety of apple shifted left. As a 
­response, production and sales have been dropping, 
even though the apple’s price remained more or less 
flat. As of 2013, Red Delicious apples made up less 
than 25 percent of all U.S. apple production.
	
However, not all is lost for growers of Red ­Delicious 
apples. They are still finding a good market for their fruit 
abroad, where China has become a major buyer.

general, to which higher-income 
households devote a much larger per-
centage of their income. Another 
luxury good, of a sort, is education. 
High-income families are more likely 
to send their kids to expensive pri-
vate schools and colleges rather than 
free public elementary and second-
ary schools and low-cost public uni-
versities and community colleges. As 
a result, high-income families put a 
much bigger share of their budgets 
toward education.
	
How much? Take a look at Fig-
ure 3.12, which reports education spend-
ing as a share of overall budgets. As of 
2014, a family in the $40,000–$50,000 income range spent 
1.1 percent of its budget on education. In contrast, a family 
with an income of more than $70,000 devoted 2.7 percent of 
its budget to education—quite a difference!
There’s one more category of goods whose demand 
changes with income, called inferior goods. Inferior 
goods are those whose demand might actually fall as in-
comes increase. In most cities, for example, public trans-
portation—bus and rail—is an inferior good used mainly 
by people who cannot afford cars. In Los Angeles, a city 
that revolves around its cars and freeways, the great ma-
jority of the people who use public transportation to get to 
	
As their incomes rise, then, people don’t just consume 
more of the same goods. They shift their consumption pat-
terns to other goods. Instead of a small used car, they buy a 
luxury automobile. They live in a bigger home, with more 
bedrooms and more land, and eat at expensive restaurants. 
They take long vacations overseas and send their kids to 
­expensive colleges.
	
This shift in spending patterns holds true for countries as 
well. Take China, for example. As the incomes of its citizens 
have risen, they have bought a lot more cars and taken a lot 
more vacations to places like Australia and the United 
States. Energy use has shifted from wood stoves to electric-
ity, and food consumption has shifted from staples such as 
rice to more expensive items such as meat and even im-
ported apples.
	
It’s helpful to classify goods and services into three dif-
ferent groups according to how their consumption changes 
with income. A normal good is one whose demand rises 
more or less in step with income, which includes a wide va-
riety of goods and services such as housing, medical care, 
and motor vehicles. As you earn more, you buy more of 
these goods, though perhaps of different types. (By goods, 
of course, we mean goods and services.)
	
A luxury good is one whose demand rises very sharply 
as income increases. Some examples of luxury goods in-
clude restaurant meals, travel abroad, and air travel in 
NORMAL GOOD
A good whose de-
mand rises more or 
less in step with 
income.
LUXURY GOOD
A good whose de-
mand rises sharply as 
income increases.

quantity demanded 
falls as income 
increases.

doesn’t change much even if the price changes a lot. Other 
examples of inelastic supply include the number of golf 
courses in California and the amount of land in New York 
City. Of course, eventually new golf courses can be built 
and new land might be added by landfill—but it’s a long 
process.
	
Similarly, inelastic demand means that the quantity 
demanded doesn’t change much even if the price changes 
a lot. For example, let’s suppose a lot of visitors are com-
ing to a town for a big event—the Olympics, say, or a 
political convention. Now suppose a hotel burns down (of 
course no one is hurt), which is equivalent to a decrease 
in supply. The price of hotel rooms is likely to skyrocket, 
but the quantity of rooms demanded is not likely to 
change much.
	
On the other hand, elastic demand means that a small 
change in price has a big impact on quantity demanded. For 
example, the demand for orange juice is elastic because 
many people are willing to switch to other kinds of juice or 
to other beverages when orange juice is too expensive. Look-
ing at the other side of the market, elastic supply implies 
that a small price change has a big impact on quantity sup-
plied. (The appendix to Chapter 6 defines the concept of 
elasticity more precisely.)
The use of the word elastic for this economic 
idea makes sense when you think of a rubber 
band that’s elastic: you can stretch it a long way 
without much effort—like demand or supply 
that changes readily with only a small change 
in price. A steel bar, by contrast, is inelastic and 
can’t be bent without a great deal of effort or 
special machinery.
CONCLUSION
We’ve covered a lot of ground in this chapter. We started with 
the basics of market equilibrium, examined the different kinds 
of supply and demand shifts, and finished up with a short dis-
cussion of elasticity. Along the way, we gained better insight 
into how we can think about the impact of some of the most 
important changes in the economy, including the expansion of 
the Internet, the rise of China, and the large fluctuations in raw 
material prices.
	
In the next chapter, we will look more closely at the sup-
ply side of markets. In particular, we will consider how busi-
nesses make their production decisions. How do they decide 
how much to produce, how many people to hire, how many 
machines to buy, or how many stores to open? These are the 
key questions we will address next.
work—mainly buses—earn $25,000 
or less a year. Once people can afford 
a car, they stop riding public transpor-
tation. Other U.S. ­cities—with a few 
exceptions like New York—have much 
the same pattern.
Other inferior goods include cheap 
beer, shoddily made clothing, and 
rental housing. Corporations often tar-
get different products toward low-­
income and high-income consumer 
sectors. The automakers, for example, 
have a range of models that run from 
relatively inexpensive to very pricey as 
a way to appeal to the widest possible 
array of purchasers.
A BRIEF LOOK AT  
ELASTICITY  LO3-6 
We’ve seen that equilibrium price and 
quantity change in response to supply 
and demand shifts. Let’s finish up by 
asking which will change 
more—price or quantity? 
If frost suddenly destroys 
a big portion of the or-
ange crop—a supply 
shift—does that create a 
small increase in orange 
juice prices or an enor-
mous one? A small change in the 
quantity of orange juice demanded or 
a big one? If Chinese consumers sud-
denly develop a desire to vacation in 
Hawaii—a demand shift—do hotel 
prices there jump a lot or a little? Does 
the quantity supplied of hotel rooms 
change a little or a lot?
The answers depend on the supply 
and demand curves. In some markets, 
shifts show up mainly in price rather 
than quantity. For example, in the case 
of the Chinese tourists in Hawaii, the 
number of hotel rooms in Hawaii won’t change much, at 
least until new hotels can be built, so a sudden increase in 
Chinese tourists will cause hotel prices to rise.
	
In the language of economics, hotel rooms in Hawaii 
have an inelastic supply—that is, the quantity supplied 
LO3-6
Review the basics 
of elasticity.
INELASTIC SUPPLY
A sitution where the 
quantity supplied of a 
good does not change 
much even if the price 
changes significantly. 
More precisely, a situ-
ation where the price 
elasticity of supply is 
less than 1.
INELASTIC DEMAND
A situation where the 
quantity demanded 
does not change 
much even if the price 
changes significantly. 
More precisely, a situ-
ation where the price 
elasticity of demand is 
less than 1.
ELASTIC DEMAND
Intuitively, a situation 
in which a small 
change in price has a 
big impact on quantity 
demanded. More pre-
cisely, a situation in 
which the price elas-
ticity of demand is 
greater than 1.
ELASTIC SUPPLY
Intuitively, a situation 
in which a small 
change in price has a 
big impact on quantity 
supplied. More pre-
cisely, a situation in 
which the price elas-
ticity of supply is 
greater than 1.
ELASTICITY
The responsiveness of 
quantity supplied or 
quantity demanded to 
changes in price, in-
come or other eco-
nomic variables.

SUMMARY
	 1.	Excess supply in a market means that quantity sup-
plied is greater than quantity demanded. Excess de-
mand means that quantity demanded is greater than 
quantity supplied. The gap between quantity supplied 
and quantity demanded is usually closed over time by 
the market mechanism, also known as the invisible 
hand. (LO3-1)
	 2.	Left to themselves, most markets eventually reach an 
equilibrium, which means that the quantity supplied and 
quantity demanded are reasonably in balance. At the 
equilibrium price, quantity supplied equals quantity de-
manded. On a graph, the market equilibrium is the point 
where the supply and demand curves cross. (LO3-2)
	 3.	The market equilibrium changes when either the sup-
ply or demand curve shifts. If supply increases, equil-
brium price falls and equilibrium quantity rises. If 
supply decreases, equilibrium price rises and equilib-
rium quantity falls. If demand increases, equilibrium 
price and quantity both rise. If demand decreases, 
equilibrium price and quantity both fall. (LO3-3)
	 4.	Important causes of market shifts include technologi-
cal change, globalization, changes in financial mar-
kets, government action, changes in raw material 
prices, and shifts in tastes. (LO3-4)
	 5.	Increases or decreases in income can exert a major 
influence on demand. Consumption patterns differ for 
low-income and high-income households. (LO3-5)
	 6.	If supply is inelastic, then the quantity supplied 
doesn’t change much even if the price changes a lot. 
If demand is inelastic, then the quantity demanded 
doesn’t change much even if the price changes a lot.

money, with the goal of making the big-
gest possible profit.
	
In this chapter, we study the basics of 
business, including production, cost, reve-
nue, and profit maximization. Because busi-
nesses are the key source of production 
and supply in the economy, this will help us 
understand how supply works in markets.
M
ost U.S. employees work in a busi-
ness that has profit maximization as 
its main goal. Some work in megacorpora-
tions like the giant retailer Walmart, the 
largest private employer in the world with 
2.2 million workers (called “associates”) in 
the United States and around the globe. 
That’s as many people as live in Philadel-
phia plus Las Vegas.
	
At the other extreme are more than 
3 million U.S. businesses with fewer than 
five employees. Almost every town has its 
local hairdresser, a small law office with 
one lawyer, a receptionist and a legal as-
sistant, and a two- or three-person web 
design firm run from home. Such small 
businesses are the heart and soul of any 
modern economy.
	
Obviously, Walmart and the neighbor-
hood hair salon are different. Yet every 
business, large or small, runs on the same 
economic principle: turning inputs into 
goods and services and selling them for

How Businesses Work
	
Profit is the difference between revenues and costs. In 
2015, Caterpillar reported a profit of about $3 billion, which 
was the difference between its revenues ($47 billion) and its 
costs ($44 billion).
	
On a smaller scale, your favorite restaurant collects reve-
nues from customers paying for meals, and it uses that 
money to pay its workers and suppliers. With any luck, rev-
enues will exceed costs, so the restaurant will 
make a profit and be able to stay in business. 
Figure 4.1 shows the basics of how a business 
operates.
Profit Maximization
For better or worse, the main objective of any 
business in a market economy is profit maxi-
mization. That is, the people running a busi-
ness want to operate it in a way that yields the largest 
difference between revenues and costs. True, a business 
might have all sorts of goals, including providing jobs for 
the local population, giving the lazy son of the founder 
something to do, or being a socially responsible corporate 
citizen. But any business must try to make a good profit—
defined as the difference between the revenue of the busi-
ness and its total cost of production—or it will have trouble 
surviving in a competitive world.
	
Profit maximization is shorthand for “trying to produce 
something with the biggest difference between the costs and 
what someone is willing to pay.” In the real world, maximiz-
ing the profit of a business is difficult. Running even a small 
business requires a multitude of large and small decisions. 
Managers have to deal with a constantly changing world, 
tough competitors, tougher employees, machines that break 
down, products consumers don’t want to buy,  corporate 
scandals, and natural disasters.
	
Businesses in the United States make a very wide range 
of profits. For example, Apple reported $52 billion in profits 
in 2015. That same year, many businesses large and small 
reported losses—that is, their costs exceeded their revenues. 
The energy production company Apache had a loss of 
$23 billion in 2015, because of low oil prices.
	
The difficulty of consistently producing a good profit is 
the reason successful chief executives of large corporations 
get paid so handsomely—and it is also why the typical CEO 
lasts only 5 years in their job. 
	
Of course profit-maximizing businesses are not the only 
source of production because there are productive enter-
prises with other goals. Private universities and hospitals, 
for example, are sometimes set up as nonprofit organiza-
tions, which means they focus on providing useful services 
to society rather than maximizing profit. Similarly, govern-
ments are not profit-maximizing, but they provide services, 
such as sanitation, national security and education. And 
most child care activities are still done by parents or other 
household members; most families are not run as profit-
making enterprises.
THE NATURE OF BUSINESS  LO4-1 
Let’s start with the big picture of how businesses operate, 
from an economic perspective. The outputs of a business 
are the goods and services it sells to customers. The inputs 
are the goods and services the business uses to produce the 
outputs. Production is the process of turning inputs into 
outputs.
For example, think about your favorite res-
taurant. The outputs of the restaurant are the 
meals it feeds its customers. The inputs re-
quired to ­produce the meals include workers: 
chefs in the kitchen and staff to bring you the 
food and clean the restaurant. Other inputs in-
clude the food ingredients and the physical ob-
jects that make up the restaurant: the oven and 
refrigerators in the kitchen, the chairs 
and tables, and the roof over the whole 
thing. A final but important input is the 
book of recipes for the dishes on the 
menu; the recipes are essential because 
without them the dishes would come 
out different each time.
Let’s consider a much bigger busi-
ness: Caterpillar, the world’s largest 
maker of construction and mining 
equipment. Caterpillar’s output in 2015 
included bulldozers, excavators, paving 
equipment, and all sorts of other heavy 
machinery, sold in virtually every 
country. The company is based in 
­Peoria, Illinois, but its products were 
made in manufacturing facilities around 
the world, using labor and other inputs 
such as buildings, steel, rubber, elec-
tronics, and energy. In 2015, Caterpillar 
employed 110,800 full-time workers 
around the world.
The Flow of Money
In a market economy, a business does 
not simply produce outputs using 
­inputs—it also collects and spends 
money. Revenue is the money a busi-
ness receives from the sales of its out-
puts to customers. Cost is what the 
business pays for its inputs.
For example, in 2015 Caterpillar re-
ceived roughly $47 billion in revenues 
for all the bulldozers and other prod-
ucts it sold. Caterpillar’s costs were 
roughly $44 billion to pay its workers, 
to build and maintain its factories, and 
to pay for the raw materials it used, like 
steel and electricity.

phones for the reservation agents, and office 
buildings for the airline managers. A television 
station may have its own studios, complete with 
cameras, props, and equipment for transmitting 
its signal. And, of course, an amusement park 
needs its roller coasters and haunted houses. 
All these physical goods are part of the capital 
used in production.
A business need not own all the capital it 
uses, however. For example, a law firm can ei-
ther own its office building or rent it. Similarly, an airline can 
either own the commercial aircraft it operates, like a Boeing 
747, or lease it from some other company that actually owns 
the plane. For example, the AerCap—a company you likely 
have never heard of—owned about 1100 
commercial aircraft as of 2015, leasing 
them out to carriers around the world.
LAND  Another input to most produc-
tive activities is land, the actual ground 
used by a business. Factories need land, 
as do office buildings. Shopping malls, 
of course, require large amounts of land. 
Even Internet retailers such as Amazon.
com require land for their warehouses, 
offices, and computer facilities.
	
Agriculture and mining are espe-
cially land-intensive. It’s not possible to 
grow wheat or extract oil from the 
ground without plenty of land. In fact, 
in these industries land can be the ma-
jor input.
INTERMEDIATE INPUTS  Interme-
diate inputs is really a catch-all 
­category that refers to any goods and 
services purchased from other businesses 
PRODUCTION  LO4-2 
At the core of any business is production—­
turning inputs into outputs that customers will 
buy. In this section, we take a deeper look at 
these inputs and production.
Types of Inputs
The inputs used by a business in the production 
process can be divided into five big categories—
labor, capital, land, intermediate inputs, and business know-
how. Let’s take a closer look at each one.
LABOR  Labor, of course, refers to the inputs supplied by 
the various types of workers that enable a business to func-
tion. At an airline, for example, labor might include the hours 
of work put in by pilots, flight attendants, ticket agents, me-
chanics, crew schedulers, gate agents, menu planners, ac-
countants, and so forth. At a television station, the labor 
inputs include the work time of the camera crews, the 
makeup staff, the public relations people, the newswriters, and 
of course the high-priced on-air talent.
We can measure labor inputs either by the number of 
workers a business employs or by the total number of hours 
worked. Measuring labor input by number of workers is es-
pecially common when the labor comes from executives and 
professionals because most businesses do not track the hours 
of their more educated workers.
CAPITAL  Capital, the second input, is another name for 
all the long-lived physical equipment, software, and struc-
tures a businesses uses in its production process. For exam-
ple, an airline needs at least one airplane (usually many 
more) to accomplish its most important function, which is to 
fly passengers from one point to another. But most airlines 
generally also need hangars to keep the planes in, tools for 
the mechanics who service the planes, computers and 
FIGURE 4.1

ers to produce 
outputs to sell 
to its buyers. In 
return, it re-

from the buy-
ers, and it pays 
its suppliers.

How Businesses Work
success by ensuring that customers are satisfied enough to 
come back or recommend the restaurant to their friends.
	
Business know-how can be why a company succeeds or 
fails. For example, the success of Google rests on two cru-
cial pieces of business know-how. The first is its search al-
gorithm, invented by founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, 
which typically gives users better results than any of its 
competitors. The second piece of business know-how is a 
proprietary method for pricing and selling search-based ad-
vertisements (those little ads that pop up next to Google 
searches). That’s how the company makes most of its money. 
Other companies have tried to duplicate the success of 
Google’s search ads, but this hasn’t been easy.
The Production Function
Economists sometimes like to think of a business as a sort of 
machine—a giant black box. At one end of the machine, we 
put in the inputs—the labor, the capital, the intermediate in-
puts, the land, and the business know-how. From the other 
end, come the outputs—the goods and services the business 
produces, whatever they may be.
	
Economists give this machine a catchy name: the production 
function. A production function tells you, given the inputs, 
what the output is going to be. In practice, a major corporation 
may have hundreds of thousands or even millions of different 
inputs and outputs, making it nearly impossible to write down 
its production function. For example, General Electric makes 
everything from jet engines to locomotives to geothermal 
power plants to digital mammography equipment.
	
It’s much easier to think about the production function for 
a small business that has only one or two inputs and one out-
put. Consider a lawn-mowing business, which for a small fee 
will take care of that green expanse in front of your house 
(as mentioned in Chapter 2). The simplest such business is 
one consisting of your next-door neighbor’s son or daughter, 
who for a fee will cut your lawn. This business has two in-
puts: cheap labor and the old push mower from the garage. 
The output is the number of lawns cut in a day. If you know 
how many hours the teenager works, you can calculate the 
output of the business.
	
Table 4.1 shows a simple production function that re-
lates the amount of labor to the amount of output. For a 
given number of hours worked, it tells you how many 
lawns will be mowed. Figure 4.2 graphs the same produc-
tion function. For example, if the workers put in 2 hours of 
and used up in production. For exam-
ple, almost every business needs to 
buy electricity and telephone services; 
these are intermediate inputs. A pizze-
ria must buy flour, cheese, tomato 
sauce, pepperoni, anchovies, and all 
the other ingredients for its pizzas. A 
steel mill buys either iron ore or scrap 
metal as an input to its production pro-
cess. A construction company buys ce-
ment, steel beams, rivets, and hard hats 
for its workers.
	
In fact, much economic activity in the United States 
consists of business-to-business (B-to-B) transactions like 
these, in which businesses buy and sell intermediate in-
puts. When you, as a consumer, go into a store to buy an 
article of clothing, that simple sale is just the visible strand 
of a broad web of B-to-B transactions. The store has to pay 
the local electric utility for power, an accounting firm for 
managing its books, and a wholesaler for the clothing it 
sells. It pays a trucking company to bring the clothing to 
the store. The trucking company, in turn, pays for gasoline, 
truck repairs, the drivers’ salaries, accident insurance, and 
so forth.
BUSINESS KNOW-HOW  One underappreciated input is 
business know-how, which includes all the knowledge and 
technology necessary for the production process. An auto-
maker, for example, must know how to design, build, and 
market cars. That includes knowledge of everything from 
how internal combustion engines work to the wind resis-
tance that a car encounters on the highway.
	
In many cases, the necessary knowledge or technology 
is built into or embodied in the equipment a company 
buys. For example, a company that buys a computer can 
use its capabilities without knowing the details of how 
the hard disk works. Similarly, the computer may come 
with accounting and word processing programs already 
installed.
	
Sometimes, necessary know-how is less tangible and 
much more specific to a particular business. A restaurant, for 
example, has recipes for each dish on its menu. It likely also 
has rules, either explicit or implicit, for how and when to 
clean the tables, how to manage the cash register, and what to 
do with unruly customers. These contribute to the business’s

Sam Walton opened the first Walmart in 1962 in Rogers, Arkansas, a town that, at 
the time, had a population of only 6,000. From these humble beginnings, Walmart 
has grown into the world’s largest retailer. How did that happen? Walmart’s executives 
have consistently made better use of business know-how than have their competitors. 
For one thing, Walmart was a pioneer in harnessing computers to track and order 
goods. The company was also one of the earliest retailers to extensively import 
cheap goods from China.

(or simply marginal product for short) 
is the extra amount of output the firm 
can generate by adding one more hour 
of labor or one more worker.
This is the first time in this textbook 
that we have encountered the idea of a 
marginal change, but it won’t be the 
last. Economists often think about deci-
sion making in terms of small incremental steps.
	
We can apply this idea to the small lawn-mowing busi-
ness of the previous section. The first hour of labor yields 
two lawns mowed. That means the marginal product of the 
first hour is 2, as shown in the third column of Table 4.2. 
labor, move along the horizontal axis until you get to 12. 
Then move vertically until you get to the output—four 
lawns mowed, in this case. As the number of hours worked 
rises, so does the output.
The Marginal Product of Labor
The production function gives an important piece of infor-
mation: how much output the business can produce given 
its inputs. But the production function also answers an-
other question: If the business expands by adding more 
workers or by having them work more hours, how much 
does its output increase? The marginal product of labor 
MARGINAL PRODUCT

erate by adding one

more hour of labor.

This table gives the production function for a small lawn-

hours worked; the second column is the number of lawns 
mowed. For example, 2 hours of work will result in four 
lawns mowed.

obviously limits the output of meals. Adding a second 
cook will likely double the output of meals just by divid-
ing the labor. But eventually, if we add enough cooks, they 
will get in each other’s way because the kitchen offers 
only limited space. As the old saying goes, too many 
cooks spoil the broth.
	
Table 4.3 shows diminishing marginal product for the ac-
counting firm. Perhaps there isn’t enough room in a small 
office for all the workers, or perhaps they have to wait for 
the single copy machine, or perhaps they spend more time 
chatting with each other. 
The Production Function with Capital
Now let’s look at what happens when we add another input: 
capital. In this case, capital comes in the form of a gasoline-
powered mower, which cuts grass a lot faster. Table 4.4 
shows the production function of the lawn-mowing business 
both with and without the gasoline-powered mower. With 
more capital, the same number of labor hours will result in 
The second hour of work yields another 
two lawns mowed, so the marginal 
product is still 2.
But what happens when the teenager 
works a third hour? By that time, he or 
she is tiring, so the marginal product of 
the third hour is only 1. To put it a dif-
ferent way, going from 2 hours worked 
to 3 hours worked yields only one ad-
ditional lawn mowed, so the marginal product is 1.
	
Let’s consider a business trying to hire a worker. When a 
potential employee is interviewed for a job, the manager 
may ask, “Why should I hire you? What will you add to my 
company?” In effect, what the worker will add to the com-
pany is his or her marginal product—the additional output 
from one more worker.
	
Think about an accounting firm that does tax returns. The 
marginal product of an additional accountant is the number 
of tax returns he or she can complete. Table 4.3 shows the 
production function for this accounting firm. The first col-
umn is the number of accountants, the second column is the 
output of those accountants, and the third column is the mar-
ginal product.
	
For example, the marginal product of the third accoun-
tant is nine tax returns. That’s because the first two accoun-
tants can produce 20 returns without him and 29 returns 
with him. The difference, 9, is the marginal product of the 
third accountant.
	
In general, as a business adds workers without changing 
the amount of capital or other inputs, each additional 
worker will have diminishing marginal product. That is, 
the marginal product will fall as the number of workers 
rises, holding other inputs constant. To see this, consider a 
restaurant. The inputs are cooks, kitchen equipment, and 
ingredients, and the output is the number of meals cooked. 
If there’s only one cook, he or she has to do everything—
cut the onions, fry the potatoes, watch the pasta—which

SPOTLIGHT: “CUT YOUR 
TREE, MISTER?”
Utility companies are supposed to be good at running 
power-generating plants cheaply and safely and deliver-
ing an uninterrupted supply of electricity. An important 
part of that task is trimming the trees and vegetation that 
grow alongside overhead power lines, so that they don’t 
fall in a storm.

However, tree-trimming is a very specialized skill, so 
utilities often outsource their tree work to experts. One 
of the biggest companies, Asplundh Tree Expert Com-
pany, reported in 2015 that it had more than 34,000 
workers around the world.

Average Product
The production function also gives us a third piece of infor-
mation: average product, which is the output divided by the 
number of labor hours or by the number of workers—in 
other words, output per hour or output per worker. For a 
lawn-mowing service, this would be lawns mowed per 
worker. For an automaker, the average product is vehicles 
manufactured per worker, perhaps with some adjustment so 
that big sport utility vehicles count more than compact cars. 
For an electric utility, the average product is megawatts of 
energy delivered per worker.
	
A business can raise its average product by investing in 
new equipment, or by reorganizing work to become more 
efficient. If one automaker could produce more vehicles 
than another automaker using the same number of work-
ers, the first company would have an 
advantage. 
	
Businesses can also raise their aver-
age product by outsourcing part of 
their operations, either within the 
United States or overseas. That is, they 
hire outside sellers to handle tasks their 
own employees once did. In the 1970s 
and 1980s, for instance, many busi-
nesses decided they didn’t want to run 
their own cafeterias or vacuum the of-
fice floors in the evening. Instead, they 
contracted out housekeeping and food 
services to specialized firms.
more lawns mowed. Figure 4.3 graphs the production func-
tion with and without the power mower.
	
What is the marginal product of an additional hour of 
work, assuming that the power mower is being used? Sup-
pose the teenager goes from working for 1 hour to working 
for 2 hours. Then his or her output goes from three lawns to 
six lawns, so the marginal product is 3.
	
Similarly, Table 4.4 shows that the marginal product is 3 
for 3 hours of work as well. Eventually, though, the teen-
ager starts to get bored and a bit tired, even using the power 
mower. That’s why the marginal product of the fourth hour 
of work is only 2.

How Businesses Work
pay rent monthly. But what happens if you buy a truck or a 
building yourself? There will be a big up-front cost—thou-
sands for the truck, hundreds of thousands or even millions for 
the building—but you expect to use that truck or building over 
several years. As the business owner, you want to figure out 
the annual cost of your purchase and spread the initial cost 
over the projected life of the physical capital. If 
you buy a $40,000 truck and you expect it to last 
10 years, you can look at your $40,000 cost as 
being spread over 10 years, or $4,000 a year. If 
you take out a loan to make your purchase, you’ll 
also have to figure the ­interest on the loan as part 
of your costs. We’ll go into this in more detail in 
Chapter 13.
COST OF INTERMEDIATE INPUTS  The 
cost of intermediate inputs is the money a busi-
ness pays for goods and services purchased from 
other companies. For example, a restaurant buys 
ingredients for making meals—vegetables, 
meats, spices, and the like—from its suppliers. For many 
businesses, the cost of intermediate inputs can be quite large.
COST OF ACCUMULATING BUSINESS KNOW-HOW  
Finally, let’s look at the cost of accumulating business 
know-how. Any outlays that increase a company’s knowl-
edge and capabilities are part of the cost of accumulating 
business know-how. This includes the cost of setting up 
­scientific laboratories to research new technologies, hiring 
engineers and designers to develop new products, conduct-
ing marketing studies to see what customers want, bringing 
in management consulting firms to tell you how to run your 
business better, sending your workers to conferences to learn 
the latest techniques, paying other companies for the right to 
use their technologies, and so on. 
	
Most companies do not officially report all their business 
know-how costs. However, they usually report their spend-
ing on research and development (R&D) on their annual 
­financial statements. In 2015, for example, chip giant Intel 
spent more than $12 billion on research and development, 
with the goal of producing faster, cheaper, and more energy-
efficient semiconductor chips.
	
In some cases, the cost of getting smarter is simply mak-
ing mistakes and figuring out how to do things better. This is 
known politely as learning by doing. For now, however, we 
will focus on the monetary costs of accumulating business 
know-how.
Total Cost of Production
The total cost of production is the sum of costs for each of 
the inputs:
Total cost = (Cost of labor) + (Cost of capital and land) 
+ (Cost of intermediate inputs) + (Cost of accumulating 
business know-how)
	
More recently, businesses have systematically sent their 
manufacturing and customer service processes overseas. Call 
centers and customer support operations have moved to India, 
the Philippines, and other low-wage, English-speaking coun-
tries. Computer companies have outsourced production of many 
laptop and desktop computers to Asian manufacturers. That 
means businesses have been able to lower their 
employee counts without cutting their output. 
This boosts the average product.
COST  LO4-3 
So far, our discussion of business has mostly 
omitted any mention of money. We’ve focused 
on the process of production, turning inputs 
into outputs. But every input has a cost—that’s 
the nature of a market economy. If a business 
wants to make the best profit-maximizing deci-
sions, it has to know how its costs vary with its 
production decisions. We’ll start by looking at the cost of 
each input and then at how they are put together.
Types of Cost
COST OF LABOR  The cost of labor of a business is its 
monetary outlays for workers. In the simplest case, it is the 
price of labor per unit times the amount of labor used, where 
the price of labor is the workers’ wages—either hourly wages 
or monthly salaries, depending on the jobs. On top of that, 
many businesses provide additional benefits at their own cost, 
such as vacation days, retirement bene-
fits, and medical and dental insurance. 
Top managers at large companies often 
get a wide variety of other types of com-
pensation, ­including use of corporate 
jets, health club memberships paid for 
by the company, and sometimes even 
paid housing.
COST OF CAPITAL AND LAND  
The cost of capital and land is the out-
lay for buying or renting equipment, 
structures, and land. Businesses can 
generally either buy or rent physical 
capital—like a building, a truck, or a 
computer. The same is true for land: A 
copper mining company will either buy 
land with copper ore or rent the right to 
mine from the owner of the land.
If a business rents a truck, the truck’s 
cost per period is (not surprisingly) the 
price of the rental for that period. Simi-
larly, if your business occupies space in 
somebody else’s building, you generally

tells you the ­total cost of producing each level of output, 
using the cheapest and best methods known to the com-
pany at the time.
	
The cost function for your candy company might look 
something like Table 4.5. The left column of this table 
gives the possible levels of output for the company, while 
the right column reports the total cost for that level of out-
put. The right column says, for example, that producing 
3,000 pieces of candy will cost $3,600, producing 7,000 
pieces of candy will cost $10,100, and 
producing no candy will cost $500 
(the wages for the security guard, per-
haps, to watch the empty factory).
	
We can also graph the cost function, 
as shown in Figure 4.4. If you want to 
	
Here’s one way to think about total cost. If you own and 
operate a McDonald’s restaurant, your ­labor cost is wages and 
benefit payments to your hamburger flippers and cashiers. 
Your cost of capital and land is the rent on your store plus the 
cost of the food preparation equipment. The cost of intermedi-
ate inputs includes the money you pay for the beef patties, the 
buns, and the employees’ uniforms. And the cost of accumulat-
ing business know-how is the time and money you need to go 
through McDonald’s extensive training program for prospec-
tive owner–operators, including a stint at “Hamburger Univer-
sity.” All of these added together make up your total cost.
The Cost Function
Imagine for a moment that you work for a company that 
makes candy. The members of the National Confectioners 
Association include candy manufacturers such as the Ameri-
can Licorice Company and Tootsie Roll Industries. The top 
company managers are going to decide how many thousands 
of pieces of candy to make in their factory, and they want to 
know how much each production level will cost.
	
So, you spend a week doing the calculations for each po-
tential level of output: how many workers and candy ma-
chines are needed, the cost of the sugar and the wrapping 
paper, whether the company will need extra security guards 
if the factory has to run an extra shift at night. When you’re 
done, you know the total cost of producing 1,000 pieces of 
candy, 2,000 pieces, and so on. (The appendix following 
Chapter 6 goes deeper into the economics of the cost func-
tion and profit maximization.)
	
Your bosses don’t need to know all the details of the 
calculation, though. All they need is the summary. The 
cost function summarizes the results of your calcula-
tions. That is, the cost function is like a calculator that

How Businesses Work
Figure 4.5 graphs the marginal cost curve. We can see from 
both the figure and the table that the marginal cost rises as the 
plant’s production increases. Why should each additional piece 
become more expensive? Workers have to be paid overtime, 
machines break down more often if they run all the time, and 
the factory has to hire inexperienced workers who make more 
mistakes and require training. Generally speaking, economists 
tend to assume that marginal cost rises with quantity produced.
Variable versus Fixed Costs
So far we’ve discussed the cost function as if we could 
change every input equally easily. In reality, however, 
managers typically find some inputs easier to change than 
know the cost of produc-
ing 5,000  pieces of 
candy, move across the 
horizontal axis ­until you 
come to 5,000. Then, 
the graph tells you the 
total cost is $6,350. The cost function is up-
ward-sloping because it costs more to pro-
duce more candy.
Marginal Cost
Knowing the cost function for different lev-
els of output is useful. But for profit maxi-
mization, what’s more important is 
marginal cost. The marginal cost, or MC, is 
the added expense of producing one more 
unit of output. To put it a slightly different 
way, if a company decides to ­expand output 
by one unit, the marginal cost is the 
­additional total cost. More precisely,
Marginal cost = (Added total cost of producing 
additional units of output) ÷ (Number of additional units 
of output)
Table 4.6 shows how we can calculate the marginal cost 
for the candy factory. Notice that the first two columns re-
peat Table 4.5. For example, the cost of producing 1,000 
pieces of candy is $1,500, and the cost of producing 2,000 
pieces of candy is $2,500. The added cost to produce an ex-
tra 1,000 pieces (2,000 − 1,000) is $1,000 ($2,500 − 
$1,500), so the marginal cost in the third column is $1.00 
per piece ($1,000 ÷ 1,000).

For example, as the business increases production from 1,000 to 2,000 pieces 
of candy, the total cost rises from $1,500 to $2,500. The marginal cost is  
$1 per piece (the additional total cost divided by the additional number of 
pieces of candy).

On the other hand, outsourcing turns 
some decisions that used to be about 
fixed costs into decisions about variable 
costs. Suppose a U.S. company designs 
a new laptop ­computer and hires a 
­Taiwanese company to make it. The cost 
of building and operating the computer 
factory—which is owned by the Taiwan-
ese company—is now a variable cost for 
the U.S. company instead of a fixed cost.
	
We can distinguish between the 
short-term cost function and the long-
term cost function. The short-term cost 
function assumes fixed costs can’t be 
changed. If you own a building or a fac-
tory or have a long-term contract with 
your workers, you can’t easily alter 
these inputs in the short term.
	
The long-term cost function, in 
contrast, puts everything up for grabs, 
including all the fixed costs (which are 
not so fixed in the long run). For ex-
ample, the short-term cost function for 
Starbucks assumes all its retail loca-
tions are fixed. The long-term cost 
function, though, assumes the coffee 
chain can open new stores and close 
those that are not making a profit.
REVENUE  LO4-4 
Now we come to the final piece of the 
business: revenue. Once we understand 
revenue, we can understand the basics of 
how companies maximize their profits.
A Simple Example
Revenue is the amount of money companies get 
from selling their products or services. In the 
simplest case, a business sells only one product at 
a fixed price. Then the revenue is equal to the 
number of units sold times the price per unit.
For example, a hot dog stand cooks hot dogs 
and then sells them. If the price is $1.50 each, 
the revenue equals the number of hot dogs sold times $1.50. 
Table 4.7 shows the revenue, given the number of hot dogs 
sold (assuming that all the hot dogs can be sold). If the price 
per hot dog were higher, the revenue would be higher too.
	
More generally, a business may have several different ways 
to bring in money, beyond just selling a single product. Banks, 
for example, take in money by charging interest on the loans 
they make. But they also may charge people fees for withdraw-
ing money from their automated teller machines. (For other 
examples, see “How It Works: Finding More Revenue.”)
others. For ­example, if business at a restaurant suddenly 
increases, it’s easier to add more waiters and cooks to pre-
pare and serve the meals than it is to add another dining 
room to the restaurant.
	
We can think of businesses as having two types of costs: 
variable costs and fixed costs. Variable costs, also known as 
short-term costs, are those that managers can quickly raise 
or lower by decisions they make today. For example, it’s 
easy for a retailer to adjust the number of hours its sales-
people work. Similarly, advertising is a variable cost for a 
retailer, who can decide week to week how much advertising 
to buy in the local newspaper or on the Internet.
	
By contrast, fixed costs, also known as long-term costs, 
are harder to change; more precisely, a decision by a busi-
ness to change its fixed costs will take longer to have an ef-
fect. For example, the rent a retailer pays for its building is a 
fixed cost. The business can certainly change that cost—but 
it takes a lot longer to open a new location somewhere else 
than it does to hire a new worker.
	
There’s one quirk you should remember about this termi-
nology of fixed and variable. Fixed costs, of course, are not 
really fixed forever. The retailer could close down the store, 
for example. But, in the short run, it’s much easier to change 
variable costs than fixed costs.
	
For that reason, variable costs are more relevant for short-
term, everyday decision making, whereas fixed costs are 
properly the domain of long-term strategic planning. An ex-
ample of variable costs can be found in your local newspa-
per. Each day, the publisher of the newspaper has to decide 
how many pages the paper should include. A thick paper 
with more pages has more room for news, for advertise-
ments, and for humorous feature stories. But a thick paper 
costs more money—for printing, for ink, and for workers to 
run the printing presses. Including the additional pages is a 
variable cost. In contrast, buying the printing presses is a 
fixed cost.
	
Or consider retailers such as Starbucks, 
Walmart, and Home Depot. Each day or week, 
their managers decide how to staff their 
stores—how many workers to have on each 
shift. That’s a short-term decision. A key long-
term decision for these companies is how many 
new stores to open and where. In 2015, for ex-
ample, Starbucks added new company-operated 
stores in the United States and China, while re-
ducing the number of company-operated stores in the United 
Kingdom and France. Such long-term decisions alter the 
fixed costs of doing business.
	
In some parts of the economy, hiring decisions may actu-
ally be tougher to reverse than brick-and-mortar investments. 
In the government sector, many workers are protected by 
unions and civil service rules, which make it tough to fire 
them except in cases of severe misconduct. On many college 
campuses, it is easier and faster to put up a new building than 
it is to fire a tenured professor.

CH 04 
How Businesses Work
A profit-maximizing business will increase production 
as long as marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost.
That is, as long as the added revenue from an additional unit 
of output is greater than the additional cost of producing that 
unit, expansion will earn more profit for the business. For 
example, suppose the cost of hiring an additional landscape 
worker is $300 for a 40-hour week. Now suppose the extra 
worker can mow enough lawns to produce an additional 
$500 of revenue. Adding this extra worker makes sense be-
cause she can produce an additional $200 in profits over the 
$300 cost of hiring her.
	
For most businesses, marginal cost increases as output 
rises. Such a business will keep expanding up to the point 
that marginal cost is equal to marginal revenue (think about 
walking up to a line but no further). So the profit-maximiz-
ing rule is sometimes written this way: At the profit-maxi-
mizing output, marginal cost is equal to marginal revenue.
An Example
Let’s look at an example in detail. Let’s revisit 
the candy factory discussed earlier in this 
chapter.
Table 4.8, on page 65, is probably the most 
complicated table you’ll see in this textbook, so 
Marginal Revenue
Revenue typically goes up when a busi-
ness expands production and sales. The 
question is: By how much?
The marginal revenue is the addi-
tional money a business gets from pro-
ducing and selling one more unit of 
output (we’re assuming at this point that 
the business sells everything it makes). 
In the simplest case, the business can 
sell as much as it wants at the going 
market price. This usually reflects the 
business ­being small relative to the total 
market. (We will see in Chapter 5 that 
this kind of market is known as perfect 
competition.) 
In this case, the marginal revenue 
from selling one more unit—that is, 
the extra revenue from the additional unit—is equal to the 
price. The more the business produces, the more it can sell 
at the same price. For our hot dog vendor, the marginal 
revenue is $1.50 per additional hot dog cooked and sold.
PROFIT MAXIMIZATION  LO4-5 
Now we get to the bottom line of this chapter: If profit de-
pends on the difference between revenue and cost, both of 
which are affected by production, how does a 
business owner or manager decide how much to 
produce? The answer is that once we have both 
the cost and revenue functions, we can slowly 
increase the output of the business until we find 
the level that maximizes profit.
	
The profit-maximizing rule is a simple 
one:
TABLE 4.7

Hot Dogs Cooked and 
Sold in a Day

All Hot Dogs Can Be 
Sold at $1.50 Each)
	
$15
	
$30
	
$45
	
$60
	
$75
The first column gives the output of the hot dog stand, and 
the second column gives the revenue amounts, assuming 
the price per hot dog is $1.50. Assuming all hot dogs that 
are made can be sold, the revenue is simply the number of 
hot dogs times $1.50.
One of the most important tasks of a business is finding 
new ways to make money from the same products. That 
requires figuring out what people are willing to pay for.
	
For example, electronics retailers get revenue from 
selling customers a big-screen television or computer. 
In addition, they get quite a bit of money from selling 
buyers an extended warranty—that is, a promise to fix 
the TV or computer if something goes wrong over the 
next few years.
	
Airlines generate revenue from ticket sales, but 
they’ve increasingly moved toward charging for food 
on board, more spacious seats, and extra baggage. 
Movie theaters sell access to films, of course, but they 
also generate revenue by selling giant candy bars, 
huge bags of popcorn, and cups of soda so large they 
could swallow a small dog.
	
Sports teams have had great success broadening 
their sources of revenue beyond game tickets. They 
sell parking, food, and drink. Television rights are a big 
money maker for most teams. And looking for more 
revenue, sports teams turned to selling the naming 
rights for their stadiums and arenas.

let’s take it step by step. We’ve seen the first three columns 
before in Tables 4.5 and 4.6—the output of the factory, the 
cost of production, and the marginal cost. The fourth column 
is total revenue, assuming each piece of candy sells for $1.50 
(perhaps a chocolate bar or a whole pack of gum). For ex-
ample, 4,000 pieces of candy bring in $6,000 in revenue.

The candy company will increase output as long as marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost. At an output of 4,000 pieces, the 
marginal revenue of $1.50 per piece is greater than the marginal cost of $1.25 per piece. At an output of 6,000 pieces, the mar-
ginal revenue of $1.50 per piece is less than the marginal cost of $1.75 per piece. The profit-maximizing level of output is 5,000 
pieces, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost.
Suppose a business makes a million dollars in profit. 
Who gets it? The short answer is that the profit belongs 
to the owners of the business, but they may not always 
be able to take it home with them.
	
A small business may be owned by one person or a 
small number of partners. They can choose to take the 
profit out of the business and use it to send their kids 
to college. Alternatively, they can pay higher wages to 
their employes. Finally, they can reinvest the earnings 
to expand the business. Their hope in doing so is that 
their investment will make the business worth even 
more in the future.
	
The situation is similar for a large company. As we 
will see in Chapter 13, a large public company may 
have millions of shareholders who are all part owners 
of the company. The company will typically distribute 
some profit to them in the form of dividends, which are 
quarterly payments of cash per share of stock. The 
managers of the company can then use the rest of the 
profits to raise wages for the company’s workers or  
reinvest it in expanding the business.
HOW IT WORKS: WHO GETS 
THE PROFIT?

How Businesses Work
The Law of Supply Revisited
Suppose that in Table 4.8, the price was $2.00 per piece 
rather than $1.50. What would happen to production? Ac-
cording to the profit-maximizing rule, the company will in-
crease production as long as marginal revenue exceeds 
marginal cost. If the price is $2.00 per piece, the company 
will want to increase production up to 7,000 pieces of candy. 
In other words, a higher price leads to increased production 
because the company wants to maximize profit.
	
Now we can better understand the law of supply de-
scribed in Chapter 2, which said that the quantity supplied in 
a market generally rises as the price increases. Because busi-
nesses are profit-maximizing, they can generally make more 
money by expanding production when the market price in-
creases, assuming they are able to sell all they make.
Short-Term Profit Maximization  
and Long-Term Decisions
We can distinguish between short-term and long-term profit 
maximization. In short-term profit maximization, we fo-
cus on achieving the highest profit, assuming that fixed costs 
cannot be changed. The managers of the candy company 
make their production decisions taking the current size of 
the factory as a given.
	
In contrast, when we consider long-term profit maxi-
mization, we assume a business can vary all its inputs, even 
The fifth column, marginal revenue, is 
the extra money the company earns by 
selling one more piece of candy. The 
final column, profit, is revenue minus 
costs.
Following our profit-maximizing 
rule, we expand production as long as 
marginal revenue exceeds marginal 
costs. For example, at the 2,000-piece 
level of production, marginal revenue is 
$1.50 and marginal cost is $1.00, so it 
makes sense to produce and sell more 
because the extra revenue exceeds the 
extra cost.
The expansion continues up to  
the 5,000-piece level of production 
(bolded in the table). This is the profit-
maximizing level of production be-
cause, up to that point, we can still earn extra revenue. At 
higher levels of output, marginal cost rises to $1.75, which 
is more than marginal revenue. Thus, profit falls if output 
goes above 5,000 pieces.
One final note: It is sometimes true that there is more 
than one level of output that maximizes profit. In this ex-
ample, an output of 4,000 pieces gives the same profit as 
5,000 pieces. In such a situation, choose the output where 
marginal revenue equals ­marginal cost.
SPOTLIGHT: BOEING’S LONG-TERM DECISION
The long-running competition between Boeing and Airbus, 
two giant commercial airplane manufacturers, offers a clas-
sic example of long-term decision making. Designing and 
testing a new commercial airplane is an expensive proposi-
tion requiring billions of dollars. Airplane manufacturers 
make investments like this in the expectation that the pay-
off will come over decades. For example, Boeing started 
developing the 747 in 1963; its first flight was in 1969; and 
the model is still being sold as of 2015.
	
In the mid-1990s, both plane makers had to place bets 
for the future. The executives leading Airbus chose to build 
the giant A380, capable of carrying up to 800 people (and 
requiring landing strips to be strengthened at airports 
around the world). So far most airlines have been reluctant 
to buy such an enormous plane.
	
On the other hand, Boeing designed a smaller, more fuel-
efficient plane called the Dreamliner, or the 787. Boeing had 
a ton of orders for its new plane as of mid-2008, with the ex-
pectation that the first 787s would soon be carrying passen-
gers. However, a series of production problems meant that 
the new planes did not debut until late 2011. A 3-year delay 
in introducing a new product would probably be disastrous 
for many companies. However, because the 787 will likely 
be sold for many years into the future, Boeing still expects to 
make good profits on the new model.

wait for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to 
approve the drug for sale. At each step along the way, the 
drug company has to decide, based on its analysis of costs 
and revenues, whether it makes sense to keep funding the 
new drug.
	
Long-term decisions are inherently uncertain ones. Espe-
cially when companies are committing themselves to new 
technologies and new markets, it’s tough to know what is go-
ing to happen. (For an example of long-term decision making 
in the airplane industry, see “Spotlight: Boeing’s Long-Term 
Decision.”)
CONCLUSION
We started this chapter with Walmart and ended it with 
­Boeing. In between, we looked at candy makers, lawn-mowing 
enterprises, giant oil producers, and fast-growing Internet 
search firms—all examples of profit-maximizing businesses 
with production, revenues, and costs. The basic logic of 
profit maximization that we saw here is essential for under-
standing how today’s economy works.
	
In Chapter 5, we will show how competition—or the lack 
of competition—affects the production and pricing behavior 
of businesses, and what that means for the broader 
economy.
going as far as shutting down. The candy company can expand 
its factory; close part of it down; or move its operations to 
Canada, Mexico, or China.
	
Long-term profit maximization also includes the results 
of a company’s big strategic decisions, like coming up with 
new products or entering new markets. Some companies, 
like Apple, maximize their profits by innovating. Others do 
it by offering low prices and trying to get maximum effi-
ciency from their workforce.
	
For an automaker like Ford or Toyota, long-term deci-
sions are connected with the design and development of 
new models—what they will look like, what performance 
characteristics they will have, and what market segments 
they will address. Take Toyota’s development of the 
Prius, the first widely selling hybrid car, able to run on 
both gasoline and electricity. A team of Japanese engi-
neers started designing the hybrid car in 1993. The 
­biggest decision—what kind of engine to use—wasn’t 
made until 1995. The Prius was first offered for sale in 
December 1997.
	
For executives at big drug companies, two key decisions 
are how much to invest in developing new drugs and where 
the most profitable opportunities might be. It can take up to 
10 years to develop a new drug in the laboratory, test it on 
animals, make sure it is safe for humans, run some large-
scale studies to see whether it actually is beneficial, and then

SUMMARY
	 1.	A business buys inputs from its suppliers. It uses those 
inputs to produce output—the goods and services it 
sells to its customers. The money the business pays 
for the inputs is its cost, and the money it receives 
from its customers is its revenue. Profit is the differ-
ence between revenue and cost. (LO4-1)
	 2.	The inputs to production include labor, capital, land, 
intermediate inputs, and business know-how. The pro-
duction function summarizes the output of a business, 
given the levels of its inputs. The marginal product of 
labor is the extra amount of output a business can 
generate by adding one more hour of labor or one 
more worker. (LO4-2) 
	 3.	The total cost of production is the sum of the costs for 
all of the inputs. The cost function for a business 
­reports how much it will cost to produce a given level 
of output. Marginal cost is the added cost to produce 
one more unit of output. Variable costs can be quickly 
changed by the decisions of managers. Fixed costs 
take longer to change. (LO4-3)
	 4.	Revenue is the amount of money companies get from 
selling their products or services. Marginal revenue is 
the added revenue from producing and selling one 
more unit of output. In perfect competition, the mar-
ginal revenue will be equal to the price. (LO4-4)
	 5.	A profit-maximizing business will increase production 
as long as marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost. 
Short-term profit maximization holds fixed costs con-
stant. Long-term profit maximization allows all inputs 
to vary. (LO4-5)

to operate, what they could produce, what 
raw materials they could use, and so on. 
Competition was discouraged. The prob-
lem was that this system of direct control 
did not result in a rising living standard. 
­After an economic crisis in 1991, India’s 
political leaders changed course, embrac-
ing competition and a market economy, 
leading to faster economic growth, a ris-
ing living standard, and millions of Indians 
escaping deep poverty. 
	
In this chapter, we begin by examining 
how perfect competition works in a single 
market. Then, we’ll examine alternatives 
to perfect competition and where they fall 
short. Finally, we’ll explain the benefits of 
perfect competition, which are a key justi-
fication for the market economy.
W
e’ve all been brought up on the idea 
of competition in sports and in life. 
I win, you lose; you win, I lose.
	
Yet competition plays a very different 
role in a market economy. What economic 
theory says—and experience confirms—is 
that under the right circumstances, com-
petition is a win–win proposition. Compa-
nies compete against each other to 
deliver to consumers what they want at 
the lowest cost. In the short run and the 
long run, competition in the market leads 
to more production, more innovation, and 
higher standards of living.
	
These benefits of competition are the 
key reasons the market economy remains 
the best way to organize an economy, 
even after the Great Recession and the 
slow recovery that followed. If competi-
tion did not deliver a higher standard of 
living, there would be much more political 
opposition to all the insecurity and turmoil 
that inevitably come along with a market 
economy.
	
India offers a good illustration of the im-
pact of competition on the standard of 
­living. Until 1991, the Indian government 
exerted direct control over its economy. 
For example, government ­bureaucrats 
­determined which factories were allowed

Competition and Market Power
Under what circumstances will we expect to see price-tak-
ing behavior? First, products have to be standardized so buy-
ers can readily compare them. Standardized products differ 
in a small number of easily identifiable features. In the United 
States, corn comes in five grades, depending on factors such 
as the percentage of broken kernels. So commercial purchas-
ers of corn know that one bushel of “U.S. No. 2 corn,” say, 
will be roughly the same quality as any other 
bushel of No. 2 corn. 
Likewise, it’s now easier to compare the 
price of different desktop computers because 
computer capabilities are becoming increas-
ingly standardized. Two computers with the 
same microprocessors, random access memory, 
and hard disk space are pretty much equivalent, 
so a purchaser can choose the cheaper one. 
(Laptop computers, by contrast, are not so easily standard-
ized.) Similarly, memory chips are standardized according 
to size and response time.
Second, for price-taking behavior to occur, sellers and 
buyers must be well informed about what all the sellers are 
charging. That means if any seller lowers its prices, buyers 
immediately know and flock there. Similarly, if a seller 
raises its price, buyers immediately know they have better 
alternatives, and they quickly leave.
Third, and perhaps most important, a market with perfect 
competition will typically have many sellers and many buy-
ers. They don’t all have to be in the same place, however. In 
national or global markets (defined in Chapter 2), buyers 
and sellers may be in different parts of the country or differ-
ent parts of the world.
Examples of Perfect Competition
Most markets do not meet all three conditions of perfect 
competition. Products may not be standardized; one dress, 
for example, is not exactly like another. It may not be easy to 
compare prices charged by different suppliers. And there 
PERFECT COMPETITION  LO5-1  
Let’s start by looking at perfect competition, which is some-
times also called a competitive market. Perfect competition 
is, in some sense, an extreme type of market that is rarely 
found in the real world. Nevertheless, it is a useful bench-
mark for understanding how real market economies behave.
What makes perfect competition special is 
that all buyers and sellers are price takers. ­Being 
a price taker means just what it sounds like—
buyers and sellers take the market price as given 
and make their buying and production ­decisions 
accordingly. Imagine that as the manager of a 
grocery store you are trying to decide what price 
to put on your all-beef frankfurters. Your com-
petitors are selling frank-
furters for $3.00 per pound. 
If you are a price taker, you charge the 
going rate in the market—$3.00 per 
pound, the same as your competitors. If 
you are a price taker, you’d be foolish to 
charge more than $3.00 because all your 
customers would buy their frankfurters 
elsewhere. And you’d be foolish to 
charge less because you can sell all your 
frankfurters at the (higher) going rate.
If you are a buyer of the frankfurt-
ers, being a price taker means that you 
accept the posted price as given with-
out trying to bargain it down. In perfect 
competition, buyers and sellers bow to 
the will of the market. No seller can 
boost its price above the market with-
out losing its customers to competitors. 
No buyer can push the price below the 
market because there are plenty of 
other buyers willing to pay the going 
rate.
PERFECT

A situation in which all 
buyers and sellers in a 
market are price takers.
COMPETITIVE MARKET

acterized by perfect 
competition.

identifiable features.
Economic Milestone
FIRST STANDARDIZED 
ENERGY USE LABELS
1980
It’s hard for a consumer to look at a refrigerator or air conditioner and know 
how much electricity it uses. In 1980, the Federal Trade Commission started 
requiring makers of major appliances to label their products with estimated 
consumption or efficiency. Since then, energy labeling requirements have been 
refined and expanded several times. Such standardized information brings the 
market closer to perfect competition by making it easier for consumers to 
decide whether they are getting a good deal.

­competition, the business can sell as much as it wants at the 
market price (P), so the marginal revenue from selling an 
extra unit of output is just equal to P.
In general, marginal cost rises as production increases. 
Thus, in perfect competition, a profit-­maximizing busi-
ness will expand until its marginal cost equals the price 
(P = MC). Once we know the market price, we also know 
the level of production for the firm in perfect 
competition.
For example, a company producing low-
end desktop computers today is in a market 
that’s close to perfect competition because 
the machines’ capabilities are so similar. 
Suppose the company can sell its computers 
for $500 each. Then it will produce up to 
the point where its marginal cost of produc-
ing the next computer is equal to $500 (see 
­Table 5.1).
For an individual business in a competitive 
market, the supply curve is the same as the marginal cost 
curve. Look at Figure 5.1. To see how much the business 
will produce at a market price of $500, we find the point A 
where marginal cost is equal to $500. That gives us the 
profit-maximizing output of 4,000 units.
As we saw in Chapter 2, the market supply curve is the 
sum of the individual supply curves. For example, if there 
are 10 identical businesses with the same marginal cost 
schedule shown in Table 5.1, then at each price the quantity 
supplied to the market will be 10 times the individual quan-
tity supplied. Figure 5.2 shows the market supply curve. 
Note that at a market price of $500, the quantity supplied is 
40,000 computers (10 × 4,000). 
may be relatively few buyers or sellers; in any area, there are 
usually few providers of cell phone service, for example.
However, in some ways, today’s economy is moving closer 
to perfect competition with the rise of the Internet and global-
ization. As markets become global, individual businesses, no 
matter how large, are less able to affect prices. Buyers have 
access to many more potential suppliers—not just in their town 
or their state, but around the world. And many businesses in 
the United States have to worry about matching prices charged 
by Asian or European competitors.
Some markets that are close to perfect com-
petition include basic foods such as wheat and 
corn. There are many suppliers and buyers in 
the United States and around the world, the 
products are standardized, and the current mar-
ket price can be seen by anyone with access to 
a computer. For example, on November 20, 
2015, the price for No. 2 yellow corn (a partic-
ular grade of corn) was $3.60 per bushel.
Some manufactured products also trade in markets that are 
close to perfect competition, with many suppliers and many 
buyers, and standardized products. For example, memory 
chips for personal computers are made by many companies, 
the chips are standardized, and it’s possible to find the cur-
rent market price for memory chips of different sizes.

Let’s stick with the example of the market for computers. 
Take a look at Figure 5.3, which shows the market supply 
curve that we have already seen in Figure 5.2. In addition, 
Figure 5.3 includes a possible market demand curve. The 
market equilibrium is the point A where quantity supplied 
equals quantity demanded—that is, the point where the two 
curves cross.

Market Equilibrium in Perfect Competition
As in any other market, equilibrium for a perfectly com-
petitive market occurs where market quantity supplied 
equals market quantity demanded. At the market equilib-
rium, price equals the marginal cost of production for each 
business. If price were greater than the marginal cost, the 
business would have an incentive to expand production. If 
price were less than the marginal cost, the business would 
reduce production. As a result, all businesses end up

demanded is 40,000 computers and so is the quantity sup-
plied. But we know even more than that. Each of the 10 
computer manufacturers produces 4,000 computers—and at 
that level of production, their marginal cost is $500, accord-
ing to Table 5.1. In perfect competition, marginal cost is 
equal to the market price.
PERFECT COMPETITION IN  
THE LONG RUN  LO5-3 
What happens in a competitive market in the long run? If 
businesses in a market are making a profit, those profits 
attract new entrants to the market, just as sugar attracts 
ants. New entrants are just what they sound like—new 
businesses competing in the same market or existing busi-
nesses in other markets that are expanding into a new mar-
ket. In fact, if there is nothing to stop them—such as 
government regulations or high start-up costs—a market 
will have new entrants as long as it looks profitable. Fig-
ure 5.4 shows how the market equilibrium changes with 
new entrants.
What happens when a new electronics store opens in a 
small town? Let’s assume all the stores sell the same brand-
name laptops, big-screen televisions, smartphones, and 
drones. Each new store increases the supply of electronics 
and causes the supply schedule to shift to the right. That 
drives down the price for everyone. Eventually, profits fall 
low enough that no one else is willing to take the plunge and 
enter the market.
Let’s call this the Big Squeeze. As 
more and more competitors move 
into a market, any business with a 
higher-than-average cost function gets 
forced out. For example, in the laptop 
computer industry, many computer 
manufacturers that couldn’t match 
low-cost producers such as Dell, Asus,

and Acer have been squeezed out. In retailing, Walmart’s 
ability to consistently offer low prices has put the squeeze on 
higher-priced competitors. Eventually, those that cannot 
make a profit are forced out of business.
In a market with perfect competition, as long 
as there is enough time and there are no barri-
ers to entry, profits will tend toward zero. A 
barrier to entry is anything that might make it 
difficult for a competitor to enter a market. For 
example, if Best Buy or Walmart wanted to 
open a new store in a town, it might need ap-
proval from the town government, especially if 
it needed a change in zoning laws. In this case, government 
regulation is a barrier to entry. Another barrier to entry is the 
lack of a key resource. Perhaps not enough land is available 
in town to put up another big store, or it might take a long 
time for a large enough parcel of land to become available.
Long-Term Survival
The Big Squeeze leads us to another 
implication of perfect competition. If 
there are no barriers to entry, only the 
lowest-cost producers survive over the 
long run. Let’s suppose you’d like to 
buy a tuna sandwich from a local res-
taurant or some other store that sells 
food. Thus, you are a buyer in the mar-
ket for tuna sandwiches. Now suppose 
there are two types of restaurants. One type—the high-cost 
producers—can make a tuna sandwich at a marginal cost of 
$3 per ­sandwich (ingredients and labor). The second type of 
restaurant—the low-cost producers—can make the sand-
wich at a marginal cost of $2 (using the same ingredients but 
a much faster, more efficient sandwich-making technique).
Over the long run, the low-cost providers will consis-
tently be able to drive down the price below $3, and at that 
price, the high-cost providers won’t be able to make a profit. 
After they lose enough money, they will have to close or 
adopt the same sandwich-making techniques as their rivals. 
Indeed, in the long run, a market with perfect competition is 
driven by survival of the fittest.
This process by which the low-cost producers drive out 
the high-cost producers over the long run occurs in any in-
dustry in which there are no barriers to entry. Consider de-
partment stores. Remember Marshall Field’s? How about 
Stern’s? Or Bradlees? Probably not—but all these were de-
partment store chains that either closed or were sold since 
2001. That period saw massive consolidation in the depart-
ment store industry—the result of intense competition from 
online retailers such as Amazon and discount chains such as 
Walmart and Target. Many existing retailers 
simply could not cut costs low enough to com-
pete. As a result, employment at non-discount 
department stores dropped by more than 40 
percent since then.
The long-run shift to low-cost producers is a 
central trend in manufacturing as well, espe-
cially for such products as basic clothing. As 
mentioned in Chapter 3, most apparel manufacturing has 
moved to low-cost countries like China and Vietnam be-
cause United States–based factories simply can’t match the 
prices of the imports. More recently, furniture manufactur-
ing has been moving to lower-cost producers overseas (see 
“Spotlight: The Furniture Industry”).
The Shutdown Decision
Not only do new businesses enter markets, but existing busi-
nesses also close down. Let’s take a closer look at the 
­shutdown decision—the decision of whether a business 
will keep operating. A shutdown decision involves closing a 
store, factory, or office and letting workers go. Usually, the 
decision to shut down is irreversible, and it can seriously 
harm employees and the local community, depending on the 
size of the business.
IF THERE ARE NO BARRIERS TO ENTRY, ONLY THE LOWEST-COST 
BUSINESSES SURVIVE OVER THE LONG RUN IN A MARKET  
WITH PERFECT COMPETITION.

CH 05

Businesses shut down because their costs exceed their 
revenues. However, they don’t make shutdown decisions 
simply because they lose money for one or two years. New 
businesses almost invariably lose money at first, and even 
many established ­companies record losses during economic 
downturns. For example, American Airlines reported big 
losses in 2008, 2009, and 2010, yet its planes continued to 
fly and carry passengers. Businesses shut down because it 
becomes clear that they are going to keep losing money—or 
they simply run out of cash to pay their bills.
Escaping Perfect Competition
Perfect competition is good for consumers because it drives 
down prices. But before finishing this section, let’s note 
there’s a force pushing against perfect competition over the 
long run. When businesses find themselves stuck in any-
thing that looks like a perfectly competitive market, they try 
to escape it. They want to show potential customers that they 
are different and better than the competition in order to 
charge higher prices.
How can a business escape perfect competition? The 
best way is to build a better product—or at least do some-
thing that differentiates your product from those of your 
rivals. Consider, for example, the mobile phone. When 
Apple introduced the first iPhone in 2007, there were al-
ready plenty of mobile phones on the market. But Apple 
was able to differentiate itself through better design, more 
powerful chips, better access to the Internet, and ease of 
writing third-party applications (“apps”). As a result, the 
iPhone quickly became the market leader and the standard 
to beat.
Another way to differentiate a product is through 
­advertising. Advertising, of course, is paid communica-
tion with potential customers through a public medium, 
such as television, the Internet, a magazine, or a billboard. 
One role of advertising is to provide information about 
what a product does and how much it costs, but good ad-
vertising also has an emotional impact. It gives potential 
buyers a sense of comfort or excitement, along with a rea-
son to buy. Advertising is especially valuable for brand 
names such as Crest, Tide, and Coke, to which consumers 
can become intensely loyal (see “How It Works: Well-
Known Brand Names”).
For example, if you go into a drug-
store, you will find perhaps 40 differ-
ent kinds of shampoo for men and 
women. They all accomplish the same 
thing—cleaning hair. However, they 
have ­different ingredients and per-
haps different levels of effectiveness. 
They all have different brand names

SPOTLIGHT: THE FURNITURE 
INDUSTRY
Few parts of the U.S. economy have been affected so 
quickly or so completely by Chinese competition as the 
furniture industry. In 1998, the United States imported 
only $2 billion worth of furniture from China. By 2000, 
furniture imports from China had risen to $5 billion; by 
2015, furniture imports from China totaled $23 billion.
	
U.S. furniture makers located in states such as North 
Carolina found themselves suddenly competing with lit-
erally thousands of Chinese furniture factories, all vying 
to offer anything consumers wanted at the lowest pos-
sible cost.
	
In effect, the market moved much closer to perfect 
competition. That benefited consumers because the 
price of furniture in the United States fell by 15 percent 
from 2000 to 2015. In other words, consumers could 
buy a lot more furniture for the same money. 
	
The downside? The furniture manufacturing industry 
in the United States lost about 44 percent of its jobs over 
the same period. North Carolina has seen more than half 
of its furniture-making jobs disappear. Competition, for-
eign or domestic, is a tough taskmaster.

and brand images, aided by copious 
amounts of advertising. And unlike 
goods in a perfectly competitive mar-
ket, they can sell for very different 
amounts, ranging from $2 to $20 for 
16 ounces.
Some economists argue that con-
sumer devotion to a well-advertised 
brand name is justified because all 
that advertising creates a reputation 
effect. This means a company that 
spends millions of dollars advertising 
a product—especially one that is used 
repeatedly like shampoo or razors—
will want to make sure its financial investment in the ad 
campaign will pay off and not be eroded by consumer 
complaints or well-publicized problems with the product. 
So economists argue that heavy advertising often means a 
product does indeed deliver what its producer promises. 
(By contrast, heavy advertising of a single-use product 
like a new movie may just be a way of getting people into 
the theater before they hear how bad the film is.)
MARKET STRUCTURE  LO5-4 
If a market does not operate under perfect com-
petition, how do we describe it? Economists 
have classified markets into several different 
types, or market structures, according to the 
number of buyers and sellers and the intensity 
of competition. Other than perfect competition, 
the main types of market structure are monopo-
listic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly.
Monopolistic Competition
Perhaps the most common market structure in today’s econ-
omy is monopolistic competition. This type of market is 
characterized by a large number of sellers with similar, but 
not standardized, products.
A good example of monopolistic competition consists of 
restaurants in a neighborhood. There may be 5 or 10 restau-
rants within a short distance of each other, all offering the 
basics—a meal and a clean place to sit. But some may be 
quiet, others noisy. Some may offer pizza, others Thai food. 
And some may be expensive, while others serve meals for a 
few dollars.
These restaurants are competitors in the sense that they 
are all trying to attract the same pool of potential diners. 
However, it is not perfect competition—no market price ap-
plies to all the restaurants. Each offers a different meal or 
dining experience from the others, so each can charge a dif-
ferent price.
What’s more, the restaurants are not price takers. If a res-
taurant lowers its prices, it knows it will take business away 
from the other restaurants and boost its number of diners. If 
it raises its prices, its quantity demanded will fall, but it will 
still keep the customers who really like its food. In other 
words, monopolistic competitors each face a downward-
sloping demand curve.
PROFIT MAXIMIZATION WITH MONOPOLISTIC 
COMPETITION  The rule for profit maximization from 
Chapter 4 was that a business boosts output as long as mar-
ginal revenue exceeds marginal cost. For perfect competi-
tion, marginal revenue is equal to price because a business 
can sell as much as it wants at the market price.
But for a monopolistic competitor, marginal revenue is 
typically less than the price. The reason is that if the business 
wants to sell another unit of output, it will have to cut the 
price it is charging everyone. That means it will lose some 
revenue from the goods and services it was originally selling, 
even as it gets additional revenue from the added sales.
Think about a restaurant serving 100 meals a night at 
$20 each. To increase sales to 101 meals a night, it will 
have to lower the menu price of the meals below $20. It gets 
additional revenue from the extra meal, but it loses some 
from the lower price for the first hundred meals it was 
­already selling.
Auto dealers face the same problem. Typically, auto deal-
ers are monopolistic competitors. They compete with other 
dealers in the same area selling other models of 
cars. The Ford dealer competes with the GM 
dealer and the Toyota dealer, who may be on 
the same block or even across the street.
To make things simple, imagine that the 
dealers post prices for the cars on their lots, and 
they have to offer these prices to everyone 
(there’s no individual negotiation). The price 
A well-known and respected brand name helps differ-
entiate a product and allows a company to charge 
higher prices and earn higher profits compared to per-
fect competition. In 2015 Interbrand published a list of 
the “most valuable” brands—that is, products whose 
brand names helped boost sales and profits. The list 
was led by Apple, Google, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, and 
IBM. In all these cases, the companies’ names convey 
positive messages about their products and services.

Table 5.3 gives an example of a revenue function, a mar-
ginal revenue function, and a marginal cost function for a car 
dealer. If the dealer sets the price at $30,000 per car, he or she 
can sell one car per day. But to sell two cars, the dealer must 
lower the price to $29,000 for both cars. How much extra 
revenue comes in? The original revenue from selling one car 
was $30,000. The revenue for the two cars is $29,000 per car, 
or $58,000 in total. Hence, the marginal revenue is $28,000 
($58,000 minus $30,000).
So the marginal revenue from selling the second car 
($28,000) is lower than the price ($29,000). You can see 
from the table that it’s true at every level of sales—the mar-
ginal revenue is less than the price.
How many cars will the dealer sell? The dealer will expand 
output until marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In this ex-
ample, the profit-maximizing output is three cars sold per day.
MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION IN THE LONG 
RUN  Generally, monopolistic competitors compete not 
only on price but also on other attributes of their products. 
For example, restaurants may try to distinguish themselves 
by quality of food or by friendliness of service. The more 
successful they are in differentiating themselves positively 
from their rivals, the more they can escape perfect competi-
tion, and the more they can raise their prices without fear of 
losing customers.
But here’s a big problem for a business in monopolistic 
competition: if you successfully differentiate yourself from 
your competitor, what’s to stop your competitor, or a new en-
trant, from imitating you? Suppose you run a restaurant, and 
you have been successful with your “Hawaiian Pizza.” For a 
while that draws big crowds, but soon the other restaurants in 
town are offering their own versions, and your competitive 
edge disappears.
In the long run, monopolistic competition starts looking 
more and more like perfect competition as more businesses 
enter the market. The big challenge for successful businesses 
is to continually come up with new ways of defending their 
competitive advantage or creating new points of difference.
each dealer picks depends on how many cars he or she wants 
to sell—that is, on the output of the dealership. To attract 
more customers, the dealer has to set a lower price, which 
lures customers away from the dealers across the street.
However, two things happen when a dealer sells one more 
car. The dealer gets the revenue from the additional car, but 
the lower price means he or she also has to give up a bit of 
revenue from the other cars that were already selling. As a 
result, the marginal revenue will be less than the price.
Musicians and actors—or indeed any kind of performers—
are great examples of monopolistic competition. Per-
formers who play the same type of music—whether 
classic rock, hip-hop, or country—obviously compete 
for the same audience. Listeners have only a limited 
amount of money and time, and the more they spend 
on concerts and music downloads for one performer, 
the less money and time they have for others. If too 
many performers are giving concerts in the same city 
at the same time, it becomes harder for any of them to 
sell out their shows.
	
If the market for music were perfectly competitive, all 
performers would have to charge the same price for 
their concerts. (Or perhaps they would charge by the 
hour so that longer concerts would cost more!) And it 
wouldn’t matter to you which performer you went to see.
	
In reality, performers do not produce a standardized 
product. No one would ever mistake Taylor Swift for 
Drake (or substitute any two performers of your choice). 
So some performers can charge much higher prices 
than others without losing all their ticket sales.

A car dealer who is a monopolistic competitor knows that selling more cars requires lowering the price. The profit-maximizing output 
comes where marginal revenue equals marginal cost—in this example, at three cars sold per day.

Competition and Market Power
In fact, this is one of the great ad-
vantages of a market economy. The 
pressure to escape perfect competition 
forces successful companies to devote 
considerable resources to creating new 
products and services or to refining and 
upgrading their existing ones. In a mar-
ket economy, standing still is a sure 
way to lose ground.
Oligopoly
Oligopoly occurs when a small number 
of sellers in a market produce similar 
products. (Small is usually defined in 
this context as four or fewer.) For ex-
ample, except for the most heavily trav-
eled routes, most cities are served by 
only a few air carriers. These suppliers 
are oligopolists.
In some situations, oligopolists can 
compete intensely. They can wage price 
wars to lure each other’s customers 
away. Such intense rivalry can make an 
oligopoly look much like perfect com-
petition, at least for a time.
Alternatively, two or more oligopo-
lists can engage in illegal collusion, 
working together to keep the prices of their products artifi-
cially high and to split the market. For instance, two local 
drugstores could agree that they’ll both sell shampoos or tis-
sues at a higher price and neither will try to undercut the other.
Sometimes, oligopolists engage in implicit collusion. 
That means they do not communicate directly about price; 
however, they let one company—the market leader—set 
prices in the market. Whatever price the leader sets, the oth-
ers follow. For example, two or three airlines may fly be-
tween the same two cities. When one airline raises ticket 
prices by $10, the other two follow immediately. This is not 
officially collusion, but it has the same effect of keeping 
prices higher than they would otherwise be.
In practice, however, it’s difficult for oligopolists to col-
lude effectively without talking to each other. There will 
always be temptation for one party to cheat, which means 
undercutting the oligopoly price by a bit to sell a lot more. 
Supplier cheating in an oligopoly actually benefits consum-
ers by lowering prices.
Monopoly
At the opposite extreme from perfect competition is a 
­monopoly. A monopoly is a market in which there is only 
one seller, and buyers have no good alternatives. As you 
might expect, a profit-­maximizing monopolist will push up 
its price to take advantage of its control over the market. If 
you own the only gas station for miles around, you can 
charge more than if you face a lot of competition.
But to charge a higher price, a monopolist has to restrict 
its output. That’s because buyers generally obey the law of 
demand—higher prices mean lower quantity demanded. 
­Because quantity supplied equals quantity demanded in 
equilibrium, higher prices mean supply has to be reduced.
How high can a monopolist raise prices? It depends in part 
on the elasticity of market demand, as defined in Chapter 3. 
If demand is inelastic—that is, if buyers don’t react much to 
price changes—then the monopolist can raise the price high 
above the competitive level. Suppose on an island, only one 
store sells food. This store can push prices up a lot because 
there are no alternatives for food buyers.
But in a monopolistic market in which demand is elastic, 
consumers will significantly reduce their purchases when 
prices go up even a little. Then the monopolist won’t be able 
to boost prices much above the competitive level. For ex-
ample, suppose you have exclusive rights to sell something 
few people want, such as land in the middle of the desert. 
Your monopoly on the land won’t do you much good; if you 
try to raise prices much above the competitive level, your 
potential buyers will look elsewhere.
True monopolies are even harder to find than markets 
with perfect competition. For example, the National Basket-
ball Association is the only professional men’s basketball 
league in the United States, so it has a monopoly on provid-
ing professional men’s basketball games. But there are 
plenty of close substitutes for your sports entertainment dol-
lar, including women’s professional basketball, other major 
league men’s sports, and college games. For that reason,

For many years the title of the biggest oligopoly went to OPEC, the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC started with 5 members and now has 13, led 
by Saudi Arabia, which has one-fourth of the world’s proven oil reserves. Historically, 
OPEC members met regularly to set the price of oil and to allocate quotas for how 
much each country will produce. However, several large oil-producing countries, 
including the United States, Russia, Norway, and Mexico, are not part of OPEC. 
Moreover, the United States has been able to use new technologies to boost oil 
production in recent years. As a result, OPEC has lost much of its power to control 
the international price of oil.

monopoly: There were high fixed costs to develop the soft-
ware, making it difficult for a new company to enter into the 
market, and customers were generally locked into their soft-
ware (people within the same company all had to use Micro-
soft Office so their documents would be compatible).
Yet technological change eroded Microsoft’s command-
ing position. The focus of digital innovation has shifted from 
the desktop computer to the Internet and to the smartphone. 
Companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple 
compete to offer new services.
Still, probably the simplest way to keep a monopoly these 
days is to have the government protect it for 
you. For example, the Post Office still has a 
monopoly on home delivery of first-class mail. 
Occupations such as manicurists and beauti-
cians are licensed by the government in many 
parts of the country, which means they are pro-
tected against competition from people who 
don’t have the right licenses. 
PERFECT COMPETITION VERSUS 
MARKET POWER  LO5-5 
Why have we made such a big deal about the difference be-
tween perfect competition and other types of market struc-
ture? Why does it matter how many competitors are in a 
market and whether they are price takers?
The Benefits of Perfect Competition
The essence of a market economy is that all economic ac-
tivities in a market are voluntary. Businesses choose to pro-
duce and sell because they benefit by earning the highest 
profit possible. Buyers make purchases because the value of 
the goods or services to them is greater than the prices they 
pay. In a market, all trades of money for goods and services 
are mutually beneficial—both buyers and sellers win.
But perfect competition goes further. In a market with 
perfect competition, businesses are price takers. As long as 
the market price exceeds the marginal cost, businesses auto-
matically choose to increase output. To put this another way, 
as long as buyers are willing to pay enough to cover the extra 
costs of production, suppliers will oblige them.
To better understand the benefits of perfect competition, 
think again about that tuna sandwich you might buy at a ­local 
restaurant. Suppose you are willing to pay $3 or less for it. 
Now suppose its marginal cost—the cost of the ingredients 
and of the cook’s time to make it—is only $2.50. As long as 
the price of the sandwich is between $2.50 and $3.00, the 
restaurant can profitably sell the sand-
wich, and you will be willing to buy it.
In perfect competition, that tuna 
sandwich will always be made and 
eaten. If a restaurant is not willing to 
make it for you, the one next door will. 
there’s a limit to how far NBA teams can raise their ticket 
prices despite their monopoly power in men’s basketball.
Most monopolies have been undermined, to a large extent, 
by globalization and technology. The local department store 
in a small town, which once was the main source of clothing 
and hardware, now faces competition from online sellers 
such as ­Amazon.com that ship anywhere in the world. People 
have access to nearly infinite sources of news, classified ads, 
and other information, rather than just the local newspaper. 
And even when only one company manufactures a product in 
a country (Boeing is the only manufacturer of commercial 
airliners in the United States), it is not a monop-
oly because it must contend with competition 
from overseas companies, like Airbus.
Even so-called natural monopolies have been 
eaten away by technological change. A natural 
monopoly is an industry in which it may make 
economic sense to have only one supplier. The 
classic example is the old AT&T (known origi-
nally as American Telephone & Telegraph), 
which for most of the 20th century, was the sole provider of 
telephone service to most of the United States. At that time, 
all telephones had to be physically connected to each other by 
wires that ran from people’s homes to central switching of-
fices. That was an expensive investment; once the wires were 
installed, it didn’t cost the phone company much to provide 
the service. Moreover, everyone had to be tied into the same 
network. As a result, it didn’t make economic sense to have 
more than one provider of telephone service.
Today, of course, there are multiple sources of tele-
phone service in your home. You can use a cell phone, get 
your phone service from your cable company, or make 
calls over the Internet. As a result, the conditions for a 
natural monopoly no longer exist.
Other natural monopolies used to include the local electric 
power company, cable company, and water company. These 
all shared two characteristics with the old telephone company. 
First, they had large fixed costs for infrastructure (wires, pipes, 
power stations, water filtration equipment) and low variable 
costs for providing service. Second, customers had to be tied 
into physical networks, so they could not easily switch.
Technological advances have made it possible to choose 
which company generates the electricity you use, even 
though there is still generally only one supply conduit to 
your home. And you can get your television shows from the 
local cable company, the local phone company, or a satellite 
TV company. 
The 1990s witnessed wide debate about whether technol-
ogy was creating new natural monopolies. Microsoft, in par-
ticular, seemed to control two large markets. Microsoft 
Windows had a very large share of the operating system mar-
ket for personal computers, and Microsoft Office dominated 
the market for word processing, spreadsheets, and other busi-
ness productivity programs. What’s more, these markets 
seemed to have the two characteristics essential for a natural

Competition and Market Power
market equilibrium is point B on the graph, and the new quan-
tity supplied is less than the original quantity supplied.
Suppose a town has lots of restaurants engaged in cut-
throat competition. As a result, the restaurants charge $10 
per person for their meals, just enough to cover the cost of 
the ingredients in the meals plus the labor required to pre-
pare and serve them. Everyone in this town, even relatively 
poor people, can afford to eat out once a week. The restau-
rants are not making much money—just enough to stay in 
business. This is point A in the diagram.
Now imagine that the restaurant owners get together and 
agree to raise the prices they charge for their meals. So in-
stead of charging $10 per person for dinner, they charge $15. 
What happens? In the diagram, the new market equilibrium 
corresponds to point B. The poorer people in this town stop 
eating out. The middle class eats out less often. The number 
of meals served drops significantly.
The restaurant owners are making more money—or they 
wouldn’t have raised their prices. The people of the town are 
worse off—paying more and eating out less. But perhaps 
most important, dinners that could have been served aren’t. 
This decrease in production and consumption represents a 
real loss to society.
Market power has other consequences, in addition to 
higher prices for buyers. Managers at a business with market 
power have little incentive to cut costs. As a result, they can 
choose to raise wages for themselves or for their employees 
above what similar workers are getting paid. This helps work-
ers at those businesses at the expense of consumers. Market 
power can make work easier for managers and workers—but 
it may not be the best thing for society.
In essence, that’s what perfect competi-
tion means—there are plenty of poten-
tial suppliers.
This idea holds not just for sand-
wiches but for any other type of good 
or service sold in perfect competition. 
Perhaps you want to buy an office 
chair. As long as the marginal cost of 
producing that chair is less than the price you are willing to 
pay, in perfect competition you will be able to find a busi-
ness willing to make and sell the chair to you.
The Downsides of Market Power
A profit-maximizing monopolist will always charge a higher 
price than a perfect competitor would. More generally, mo-
nopoly, monopolistic competition, and oligopoly all feature 
sellers with some degree of market power. Market power is 
the ability to raise prices above the level that perfect compe-
tition would produce—by restricting the quantity supplied.
Higher prices and lower quantities supplied lead to higher 
profits for a business with market power. These higher prices 
hurt customers, of course. What’s more, businesses with 
market power have to artificially hold down production and 
sales to keep up their prices.
Let’s examine the general problem of market power using 
Figure 5.5. In perfect competition, suppliers and buyers reach 
the market equilibrium A where price equals marginal cost. 
Now let’s suppose suppliers have some degree of market power. 
They band together and raise the price a bit to boost their prof-
its. Buyers cut back on purchases because of the higher price 
(the result of a downward-­sloping demand curve). The new

Alternately, businesses with market power have some-
times used their high profits to research new products and 
technologies with long-term payoffs. The classic example is 
the old AT&T, which had a near-monopoly on telephone 
service in the United States until 1982. It used its powerful 
position to do some of the most important research in the 
country such as the invention of the transistor and the laser. 
Businesses with market power have also been big contribu-
tors to charity and cultural institutions—once again drawing 
on their higher profits. 
Nevertheless, most economists believe that an economy 
with more competition performs better in the sense that it 
has higher production levels and lower costs. As we proceed 
through this textbook, we will return to this theme.
CONCLUSION
This chapter could be summarized with the phrase “why 
competition among sellers is (usually) a good thing for 
buyers.” Competition yields lower prices and more produc-
tion. Lack of competition leads to higher prices and, some-
times, a lack of incentives for businesses to try as hard as 
they might.
Yet there are economic situations for which competition 
and markets are not the right solution. That’s why the next 
chapter is devoted to the role of government in the economy.
SPOTLIGHT: THE AUTO 
INDUSTRY
For many years after World War II, the Big Three auto-
makers—GM, Ford, and Chrysler—controlled the U.S. 
auto market. They were able to keep prices high 
enough to earn good profits and often made local car 
dealers wealthy. Autoworkers did well too. They were 
among the best-paid factory workers, with generous 
benefit packages that included free health care even 
after retirement.
	
The market power of U.S. automakers began disap-
pearing in the 1970s, when competition arrived in the 
form of Toyota and other foreign automakers selling 
small, fuel-efficient cars that the Big Three didn’t have. 
Detroit’s market power gradually ebbed, and the Big 
Three could no longer boost prices as fast as overall 
inflation. In fact, from 1997 to 2015, the average price 
of new vehicles sold in the United States, adjusted for 
quality, didn’t rise at all, which benefited car buyers. 
The market power of U.S. automakers had virtually 
vanished.

SUMMARY
	 1.	In perfect competition, buyers and sellers are price 
takers. Perfect competition is more likely if products 
are standardized, if buyers and sellers are well in-
formed about what other sellers charge, and if there 
are many buyers and sellers. (LO5-1)
	 2.	In perfect competition, a profit-maximizing business 
will set its output level so that price (P) is equal to mar-
ginal cost (MC). (LO5-2)
	 3.	In a market with perfect competition and no barriers to 
entry, profits will tend toward zero in the long run. New 
entrants will come in and drive down prices. Only the 
lowest-cost businesses will survive over the long run. 
Businesses with higher costs will shut down if they 
keep losing money. Businesses try to escape perfect 
competition by differentiating their products from 
those of their rivals. (LO5-3)
	 4.	Perfect competition is just one type of market struc-
ture. The other types are monopolistic competition, 
­oligopoly, and monopoly. Monopolistic competition is 
characterized by many sellers with similar but not 
­standardized products. Oligopoly features a few sell-
ers with similar products. Monopoly has one seller with 
no good alternatives for buyers. (LO5-4)
	 5.	In monopolistic competition, profit-maximizing busi-
nesses choose an output level so that marginal reve-
nue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC). Prices in markets 
with monopolistic competition are often driven down 
in the long run by the entry of other competitors. 
(LO5-4)
	 6.	A business with a monopoly will also choose an out-
put level so that marginal revenue equals marginal 
cost. That means a higher price and a lower quantity 
supplied and demanded than in a comparable market 
with perfect competition. This is true whenever busi-
nesses have market power. (LO5-4)
	 7.	In general, markets that are closer to perfect competi-
tion perform better than markets where suppliers 
have more market power. As markets have more com-
petition, production rises and costs fall over the long 
run. (LO5-5)

CH 06 GOVERNMENT 
AND THE 
ECONOMY
Generally, economists 
start from the belief that 
markets are innocent un-
til proven guilty. That is, 
providing goods and ser-
vices through the ­private 
­sector—which includes ­privately owned 
businesses—is preferable to taking govern-
ment action unless there’s a good reason to 
think ­otherwise. Hamburgers should be sold 
by privately owned restaurants and fast-
food chains, not by the U.S. government. 
­Similarly, it would be absurd to expect that 
consumer electronics—smartphones, big-
screen TVs, and the like—should be sold or 
subsidized by the government.
I
n the presidential election of 2016, won 
by Donald Trump, one of the most contro-
versial ­issues was immigration: How many 
immigrants, from which countries, should 
the federal government allow into the 
United States?  And what should the gov-
ernment do about the undocumented 
immigrants who are already in the country? 
	
Another hotly debated issue was 
health care. In March 2010, President 
Barack Obama signed legislation to reform 
the entire United States health care sys-
tem. The goals were admirable: to provide 
health care coverage for many uninsured 
Americans and to hold down medical costs.
	
But to accomplish these goals, the 
­government had to take a much more 
­active role in guiding and controlling the 
health care system, including requiring 
most people to purchase some sort of 
­insurance. The legislation was intensely 
controversial as soon as Obama pro-
posed it, in large part because many 
­opponents objected to the increased role 
of government. 
	
The fight over health care reform is just 
one example of a long-running debate: 
How big a role should the government 
play in the economy?

ing privately owned 
businesses.

Government and the Economy
1953. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission 
(CPSC) administers this standard, giving detailed direc-
tions for manufacturers to test each mattress for resistance 
to ­burning when exposed to cigarettes. For example, the 
standard specifies how many cigarettes will be used to test 
for flammability, exactly how they should be placed, and 
how badly a mattress can be charred and still pass the test. 
The standard even explains what testers should do if a test 
mattress ignites (see “Spotlight: The Cigarette Test for 
­Mattresses”). An additional regulation, approved by the 
CPSC ­commissioners in 2006, ensures that new mattresses 
will be less likely to burst into flames when exposed to 
candles or matches.
Or consider your car, which has to meet a long list of 
federal and state regulations. The gas mileage it gets, the 
pollution that comes out of its tailpipe, the composition of 
the gasoline in its tank, the seatbelt that fits securely 
around you—all are influenced or controlled 
by government action. In 2014, for example, 
the National Highway Traffic Safety Adminis-
tration  issued a rule requiring all cars and 
other light vehicles built after May 2018 to 
come equipped with “rear visibility technol-
ogy” to enable drivers to see children and 
adults behind the vehicle. And let’s not forget 
that the highways and streets you ride on are 
almost all built and maintained by local or 
state governments, using tax dollars or the 
proceeds from tolls.
You can’t avoid government regulation when 
you go to the bank or use your credit card. Your deposits are 
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to 
$250,000, so your money is safe even if your bank goes 
­under. The Federal Reserve regulates how the bank pro-
cesses your canceled checks, including whether it is obliged to 
provide you with paper copies. The new Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission help 
protect you against abusive practices by lenders. And, of 
course, the $10 and $20 bills you use are printed by the 
­Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which is part of the 
­Treasury Department.
Finally, higher education is a mixture of private and 
­public, with the public predominating. About 75 percent of 
college students attend public institutions: four-year or two-
year colleges that are funded and run primarily by state and 
local governments. Even at many private institutions, a sig-
nificant chunk of funding comes from public sources.
The Great Depression  
and the New Deal
Today, the hand of the government is apparent in every 
corner of the economy. But if we look back about 80 years 
or so, we see a much different world in which the govern-
ment played a considerably smaller role. The dividing line 
But it’s also true that markets 
alone are not enough: Every suc-
cessful country has a large public 
sector. In the United States, the 
public sector includes the federal, 
state, and local levels of govern-
ment, which collect taxes, employ 
workers, allocate money, regulate industries, and 
participate actively in the economy. The public sector 
provides goods and services such as police, border 
control, and national defense. After all, no one would 
seriously contemplate the idea of a nuclear weapon 
being privately owned.
	
However, the right place to draw the line be-
tween the public and private sectors is often the 
subject of vehement debate. Should passenger 
trains be partly funded by the govern-
ment, as they are in the United States 
and in most European countries, or 
should train transportation be left to the 
private sector? Should foreign students 
who get degrees from American univer-
sities be allowed to ­remain in the coun-
try? Should state governments run liquor 
stores, as they do in Pennsylvania and 
Utah? And should the federal govern-
ment be able to regulate the gas mile-
age of sport utility vehicles?
	
Then there’s the government response to the 
Great Recession. After the financial crisis hit, the fed-
eral government took a very active role in propping 
up the economy and the financial system. As one 
example, the government bailed out General Motors 
and Chrysler, propping up the ailing automakers 
with loans and direct aid until they could get back on 
their feet again. (In Chapter 11, we’ll examine fiscal 
policy during the Great Recession, and in Chapter 
18, we’ll take a closer look at health care reform.)
	
In this chapter, we’ll explore the history of gov-
ernment intervention in the economy. We’ll consider 
the advantages and disadvantages of the public 
sector. Then we’ll explore the different ­justifications 
for a public sector role in the economy, including 
public goods, externalities, regulation, and redistri-
bution.

the federal government do something—anything—to get 
the economy moving again. In an amazingly short span of 
time, the Roosevelt administration passed a flurry of legis-
lation to help U.S. families and businesses. This collection 
of public programs to alleviate economic suffering was 
called the New Deal.
The New Deal included almost any program the Roos-
evelt administration thought might work. For example, the 
Works Progress Administration (WPA), approved in 1935, 
was designed to put the unemployed to work building 
bridges, highways, and airport landing fields, as well as 
painting murals on public buildings. At its peak, the WPA 
employed 3.4 million people, or more than 5 percent of the 
total labor force.
The WPA and similar New Deal work programs faded 
away as the economy gradually recovered at the end of the 
1930s. However, many New Deal programs became a per-
manent part of the economic landscape and are still with us 
today. Social Security, for example, was a New Deal pro-
gram. So were unemployment insurance, the federal mini-
mum wage, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(see Table 6.1).
The Era of Government Growth
The Depression and its subsequent economic recovery were 
followed by World War II, which pushed government 
spending and employment even higher as the United States 
geared up for war against Japan and Germany. After the war 
ended in 1945, government spending and employment 
dropped, but they did not return to their low pre-1929 levels 
(see Figure 6.1). In fact, after a short pause in the late 
1940s, the government’s role in the economy gradually 
­expanded through the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.
It is interesting that during these three decades, the ex-
pansion of government’s economic roles took place during 
the terms of both Republican and Democratic presidents. 
For ­example, the interstate highway program was started 
by President Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican who took 
office in 1953. Under this program, 
the federal government poured huge 
sums of money into one of the largest 
public works projects in history, even-
tually leading to the construction of 
almost 50,000 miles of high-speed, 
limited-access highways.
Eisenhower’s successor, President 
John F. Kennedy, a Democrat who took 
SPOTLIGHT: THE CIGARETTE 
TEST FOR MATTRESSES
Through the Consumer Product Safety Commission,  
the government gives detailed instructions for how 
the potential flammability of mattresses should be 
tested, ­including how many cigarettes to use and 
how long they should be allowed to burn. Here’s 
one example:
Place at least 18 ignited cigarettes on each mattress sur-
face. At least nine cigarettes are placed on the “Bare” 
mattress test surface, and at least nine cigarettes are 
placed on the “Sheet” test surface. Position the cigarettes 
at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) apart on the mattress surface. 
Do not ­allow more than 4 mm (0.16 inch) of the length of 
the cigarettes to burn before placing them on the mattress 
surface.
And of course, the government is concerned about the 
safety of testers: 
It is imperative that a test be discontinued as soon as 
­ignition has definitely occurred. Immediately wet the 
­exposed area with a water spray (from water bottle), cut 
around the burning material with a knife or scissors, and 
pull the material out of the mattress with tongs. Make sure 
that all charred or burned material is removed. Ventilate 
the room.

was 1929—the year the Great Depression began. We’ll dis-
cuss this period in more detail in Chapter 10, which covers 
the ups and downs of the business cycle. However, the key 
point is that economic conditions were so bad during the 
Depression that everyone was hoping the government 
could help. At the low point, one of ­every four workers was 
out of a job. There were widespread bank failures, the col-
lapse of crop prices sent many farmers into bankruptcy, 
and it looked like the entire economy was about to come to 
a shuddering halt.
As a result, after President Franklin Roosevelt was 
elected in 1932, businesses and voters demanded that

ROLE IN THE ECONOMY.

resources. In fact, between 1961 and 1972, the federal gov-
ernment spent as much on space exploration as it did on 
building highways.
President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat who became 
president when Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, made his 
mark with the Great Society programs, which were designed 
to help poor Americans. These included Head Start, which 
funds early childhood education for low-income children; 
Medicare, which provides medical care for senior citizens; 
and Medicaid, which does the same for poor Americans.
Under Johnson, the federal government also increased 
its involvement in other ways. This period saw the creation 
of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National 
office in 1961, did not stint on spending either. This is what 
Kennedy said in a May 1961 speech:
I believe that this nation should commit itself to 
achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of 
landing a man on the moon and returning him safely 
to the earth. . . . This decision demands a major na-
tional commitment of scientific and technical man-
power, materiel and facilities, and the possibility of 
their diversion from other important activities where 
they are already thinly spread.

sive and required an enormous commitment of people and

will be discussed in Chapter 17. The economics of the en-
vironment will be discussed in Chapter 19.)
Perhaps most notably, Nixon aggressively used the power 
of government to control rapid price and wage increases. In 
an August 1971 speech he said the following:
I am today ordering a freeze on all prices and wages 
throughout the United States for a period of 90 days. 
In addition, I call upon corporations to extend the 
wage–price freeze to all dividends.
	
I have today appointed a Cost of Living Coun-
cil within the government. I have directed this 
council to work with leaders of labor and business 
to set up the proper mechanism for achieving con-
tinued price and wage stability after the 90-day 
freeze is over.
This was an amazing exercise of government control over 
the economy. The federal government actually told busi-
nesses what prices they could charge, and it told unions what 
wages they could ask for. These directives would be almost 
inconceivable today.
The Era of Deregulation
Starting in the mid-1970s, the public began to feel that gov-
ernment interference in the economy had gone far enough. 
The defining moment was the oil price shock of 1973. In 
October of that year, the Organization of Petroleum Export-
ing Countries (OPEC) put an embargo on oil shipments to 
the United States and several European countries that sup-
ported Israel. The result of the cutback in oil supplies was, 
not surprisingly, a sharp run-up in the price of gasoline and 
other petroleum products, which is exactly what you’d 
­expect from a competitive market.
Americans, long used to low gaso-
line prices, had a strong negative reac-
tion. President Nixon and Congress, 
then run by the Democratic party, 
­responded quickly, but everything the 
government tried to do seemed to make 
things worse. For example, the govern-
ment implemented odd–even gasoline 
rationing. If your license plate ended in 
an odd digit, you could buy gasoline 
only on odd-numbered days.
This rationing plan seemed to make 
sense, but in practice it worked badly.

legislation authorizing the nonprofit, government-funded 
television and radio networks, Public Broadcasting 
­Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR). (Today, 
PBS still receives a substantial portion of its revenue from 
the government, whereas NPR receives little government 
funding.) When Richard Nixon, a Republican, took over 
as president in 1969, government involvement in the 
­economy continued to grow. Nixon signed legislation 
­approving the creation of the Environmental Protection 
Agency, which focuses on preserving the environment; the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which 
monitors and improves worker safety; and the Equal 
­Employment Opportunity Commission, which tries to reduce 
labor market discrimination. ­(Labor market discrimination

offer a high interest rate on its savings accounts, it wasn’t 
allowed to do so.
In 1980, Congress—then controlled by ­Democrats—
passed legislation that called for the elimination of interest 
rate ceilings, but it did not give a timetable for doing so. The 
Reagan administration aggressively took up this mandate, 
and by 1986 virtually all interest rate ceilings were a thing of 
the past.
Still, for all the deregulation, the antigovernment move-
ment was a slow and moderate one rather than a revolution. 
Take another look at Figure 6.1. In the mid-1970s the gov-
ernment employed about 19 percent of the total workforce, 
the high-water market for public-sector hiring in the past 
half century. In 2009, government employed 18 percent of 
the U.S. workforce; this is a drop, but is still way above the 
pre-Depression level.
Over the past 20 years, we’ve seen what’s essentially a 
stand-off between supporters of an increased role for the 
public sector and those who think the public sector should 
shrink. Indeed, this public debate looks much like a ter-
ritorial battle between two neighboring countries, in 
which the border shifts back and forth without much real 
change.
International Comparisons
Among industrialized countries, the United States has one 
of the smallest public sectors when we measure the ratio of 
government spending to the size of the economy. In 2015, 
U.S. government spending at all levels was 36 percent of 
gross ­domestic product according to the International 
Monetary Fund. (Remember from Chapter 1 that gross do-
mestic product, or GDP, measures how much an entire 
economy produces.) In contrast, several large European 
economies—France, Italy, Sweden, Germany, and Spain—
have government spending that exceeds 43 percent of GDP, 
as shown in Figure 6.2. In part, that’s because these gov-
ernments handle most of the health care spending for the 
countries. They also tend to offer more generous govern-
ment benefits for citizens, such as better unemployment 
insurance.
Still, all the industrialized countries, without exception, 
qualify as mixed economies; that is, they are mainly mar-
ket-based but also include a significant role for govern-
ment. Moreover, the most successful developing economy, 
China, offers support for both private-sector and public-
sector advocates. The country encourages business owners 
to be entrepreneurial and make money exporting. On the 
other hand, China’s economy looks nothing like the hands-
off, perfect competition ideal. Businesses owned by the 
government—also called state-owned enterprises—still 
make up a big chunk of the Chinese economy. Thus, the 
Chinese government has a bigger role in its economy than 
suggested by the relatively low figure for Chinese govern-
ment spending in Figure 6.2. 
they didn’t run out of gas, they started 
trying to keep more gasoline in their 
tanks than usual. Thus, the demand for 
gasoline actually grew. And because 
people were scared of running out of 
gas on the “wrong” days, motorists 
made sure to stop at a service station on 
their “right” days. As a result, gasoline 
stations were likely to have long lines 
of customers and sometimes to run out 
of fuel.
At the same time, the economy 
turned sluggish, and consumer prices rose a lot. Americans 
began to feel the United States had taken the wrong path—
not just in response to the oil embargo, but more generally. 
President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, made the first at-
tempts at deregulation—the ­reduction of government 
­control over markets. In particular, he rolled back govern-
ment oversight of the airline and trucking industries. The 
Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 ­allowed existing airlines 
to change fares, abandon old routes, and start new ones 
without asking for government permission. New airlines 
could enter the industry as well, subject only to safety 
regulations.
However, the antigovernment movement did not get into 
full swing until the 1980 election of Republican President 
Ronald Reagan. In his first term, Reagan dramatically cut 
personal taxes, reduced government spending on job train-
ing programs, and generally tried to restrict the govern-
ment’s role in the economy. Philosophically, the idea at the 
time was that less government was better.
Here’s one example of deregulation. From 1933 to 
1980, a government rule—called “Regulation Q”—had 
put a ceiling on the interest rates banks could pay on sav-
ings and checking accounts. That artificially limited the 
interest rates small ­depositors could get: if a bank wanted to

Sometimes, the best government action is to do less. Until 1978, the federal government 
controlled what routes airlines could fly and how much they could charge. But the 
deregulation of the airline industry after 1978 allowed the entry of new carriers that could 
offer cheap tickets. 
	
The first of these discount airlines was People Express, which started flying in 
1981. Operating from a dingy terminal at Newark Airport just outside New York City, 
People Express offered air fares as low as $19 off-peak to Washington, DC, and $29 
to Boston. Unfortunately, this “bus in the sky” lasted only six years because such low 
fares did not allow enough profits.

wind and solar power. The government 
can encourage immigration of educated 
workers by making it easier for foreign 
students to remain in the country after 
their degrees are done, or 
discourage immigration by 
setting quotas on the num-
ber of people who can move to the United States. 
The Benefits of the Command- 
and-Control Approach
Such a command-and-control approach to social and eco-
nomic goals directly specifies certain market outcomes and 
activities to achieve desirable goals. This approach can seem 
appealing. For example, most people agree that it’s desirable 
THE BENEFITS OF GOVERNMENT  
ACTION  LO6-2 
What’s the biggest strength of the public sector? The govern-
ment can identify a social or economic goal and, in theory, take 
action to achieve it directly. If it is important to improve educa-
tion, then the government allocates more funds 
for teachers, schools, and college scholarships. If 
a country needs a stronger defense against exter-
nal threats? Spend more on spy satellites, jet 
fighters, and tanks. If legislators decide that peo-
ple should drive slower and waste less gasoline? 
Pass a law that sets the national speed limit at 
55 miles per hour, as Congress did in March 1974 
­after OPEC cut off oil supplies in December 1973. That law, of 
course, is no longer in effect. Instead, the federal government 
sets fuel economy standards for cars and other vehicles.
The list of public-sector initiatives is nearly endless: It

Chapter 14, these agreements set trading rules that the pri-
vate sector has to follow.
Similarly, government funds the basic research that un-
derlies many technological advances. For example, the 
­Defense Department sponsored much of the original re-
search that led to the development of the Internet. And long 
experience has shown that financial markets work best when 
they are tightly supervised and regulated.
Finally, government action is also a remedy for defi-
ciencies in private markets. The Environmental Protec-
tion Agency (EPA) sets pollution exhaust standards for 
passenger vehicles. Without government reg-
ulation, it’s unlikely that new car buyers 
would spend several hundred dollars for pol-
lution control equipment despite its benefits 
for overall air quality. We’ll discuss the dif-
ferent types of government action later in this 
chapter.
THE DOWNSIDES OF 
GOVERNMENT ACTION  LO6-3 
So why don’t we just let the government control every-
thing? One reason is that for every clear example of the 
need for the public sector, there’s an equally convincing 
case of government waste and foolishness. Most of us 
have had the experience of dealing with an unresponsive 
or obstructive government bureaucracy (such as the 
­Department of Motor Vehicles).
There are several disadvantages to government interven-
tion in the economy. First, public sector managers face an 
for everyone to be able to receive at least a high school edu-
cation. In the United States, this goal was mostly achieved 
by the middle of the 20th century because local governments 
built and staffed elementary and high schools using public 
money.
In other words, the goal of giving everyone at least a 
high school education was achieved by government action 
rather than by relying on markets. These public schools 
were open to everyone, without regard to income, family 
background, or gender. Such mass education caused the 
percentage of high school graduates to rise dramatically, 
with ­beneficial effects for the economy. This 
shift could not have happened so quickly or 
so completely if schooling had been left pri-
marily in the hands of the private sector. 
What’s more, every state passed a compul-
sory attendance law requiring children to at-
tend school up to some level. Such laws were 
especially important in agricultural regions, 
where families could be tempted to rely on 
older children to work on farms instead of sending them 
to school.
Figure 6.3 shows the spending that resulted from these 
government education policies. First, government spending 
on public elementary and secondary schools soared, going 
from 1.2 percent of GDP in 1920 to around 4 percent in 
1970, staying roughly at that level through today.
Government also plays an essential role in managing 
globalization, encouraging technological change, and shap-
ing financial markets—the forces that guide today’s econ-
omy. For example, the U.S. Trade Representative negotiates 
the treaties that control trade with other countries, which 
then have to be approved by the Senate. As we will see in

causes less to be produced and sold than 
would be the case otherwise. This is 
known as the inefficiency of taxation.
Let’s see how this works. If there is a 
tax on hotel rooms, a tourist might pay 
$230 a night, but the hotel keeps only 
$200 and must give the other $30 to the 
local government. (As of 2016, for ex-
ample, San Francisco had a 14 percent 
hotel tax, which comes to $28 per night 
on a $200 per night room.) If there is a 
tax on income, the seller of labor (the 
worker) takes home less than the buyer 
of labor (the employer) pays. So if a 
person’s yearly salary is $50,000, and 
she pays an income tax of $10,000, her 
take-home pay is $40,000.
Imposing a tax on a market typically 
hurts both buyers and sellers. Adding in 
the tax, buyers pay more than they 
would in competitive equilibrium. That 
causes them to reduce their quantity de-
manded (remember the law of demand 
from Chapter 2). After taxes, sellers re-
ceive less than they would in competi-
tive equilibrium, so they reduce their 
quantity supplied (according to the law 
of supply in Chapter 2).
Let’s look at the effect of a simple tax 
on the market for chairs in Figure 6.4. 
The market equilibrium without a tax 
occurs where the original supply and de-
mand lines intersect (labeled A). Let’s 
suppose the government imposes a tax—say, $20—on the 
sale of every chair. After the tax is imposed, there is a gap 
between what sellers receive and buyers pay. Whatever the 
buyers pay, the sellers will receive $20 less, with the differ-
ence going to the government.
incentive problem. Because governments don’t need to 
make a profit, and because they can always raise more 
money through taxes, there’s little pressure on them to be 
efficient. That means a government agency can overspend 
unless closely watched. In contrast, private-sector managers 
are judged on the profits they produce, which means they 
have an incentive to hold down costs.
Second, the bigger the role played by government in the 
economy, the more businesses and individuals lobby public 
officials. This lobbying is what economists call rent-­
seeking behavior. If you need a license to open a super-
market, and there are only a limited number available, you 
will probably hire lobbyists, give campaign contributions, 
initiate lawsuits, take the appropriate politicians and bu-
reaucrats to lunch, ­offer their relatives jobs, start malicious 
rumors about their opponents, and otherwise try to influ-
ence government decisions. In fact, there’s an entire indus-
try of lobbying firms in Washington, DC, devoted to 
persuading legislators and government officials to do spe-
cial favors for their clients.
The problem with rent-seeking behavior is that an enor-
mous amount of talent, time, and resources goes into beat-
ing or influencing the system rather than improving the 
production of existing ­businesses or inventing new prod-
ucts or ­services. In 2015, lobbyists in Washington spent 
more than $3 billion trying to influence government 
decisions.
Rent-seeking behavior can also cross the line into 
­corruption: illegal activities intended to influence govern-
ment action. Bribery and other forms of political corrup-
tion are pervasive features of many economies around the 
world. Economists generally agree that government cor-
ruption slows economic growth because special favors go 
to businesses that are willing to cheat rather than to those 
offering the best products and services. (See “Spotlight: 
Corruption.”)
Third, government often suffers from a lack of flexibility 
and innovation. The government can make investments in 
far-sighted research and development, including such break-
throughs as the Internet. The problem, though, is that the 
public sector has little incentive to put breakthroughs into 
widespread use because the government can’t make a profit. 
As a result, the private sector is far better at commercializ-
ing new technologies.
But a big argument against government intervention 
has to do with taxation. Let’s look at that next.
The Inefficiency of Taxation
Any government, whether it’s your local town or Washington, 
needs money to function, and that money usually comes from 
taxes: payments from individuals or businesses to the govern-
ment. When the government imposes a tax on a ­market, the 
seller receives less than the buyer pays, so the tax pushes the 
market away from the competitive equilibrium. That is, it

Government and the Economy
Where is the new equilibrium for this market after the tax 
is imposed? It still has to be true that quantity supplied and 
the quantity demanded are equal. But the new equilibrium 
quantity after the tax is imposed will be less than the old 
quantity. Buyers pay more (see the point labeled B), and sell-
ers receive less (see the point labeled C) after transferring the 
tax money to the government.
It makes sense that a tax on something will reduce the 
quantity supplied and demanded. A tax on chairs makes 
them more expensive to buyers, which reduces the de-
mand. The same tax, by reducing the price received by 
furniture manufacturers, causes them to cut back the pro-
duction of new chairs.
The bigger the tax, the bigger the reduction in supply and 
demand in that market. At the extreme, the power to tax can 
be the power to destroy. Suppose every time you went to a 
movie theater you had to pay a $100 movie tax to the gov-
ernment. You would quickly stop going to the movies, and 
stay home and watch television. If the government raises the 
tax on a good or service high enough, it can drive the quan-
tity demanded down to zero.
Governments can impose taxes in many different ways 
(see Table 6.2). Each type of tax affects a different aspect of 
FIGURE 6.4

equilibrium quantity in the market.

private purchases, such as a car or a 
house, benefit only the buyer and his or 
her family.
The classic public good is national 
defense because armed forces protect a 
whole country rather than any particu-
lar person. Fire departments generally 
protect all the buildings in an area because if one goes up in 
flames, the others are in danger too. And most roads are 
available for anyone to drive on for free (only 
about 5,000 miles of U.S. highways have tolls 
on them, out of 4 million total miles of road 
across the country). After all, it wouldn’t do 
you any good to be able to drive on the road in 
front of your house if you couldn’t drive by 
your neighbor’s as well.
Why does it make sense for the government 
to provide public goods? Think about the police 
patrolling your neighborhood and keeping your 
street safe. It would almost never be worthwhile 
the economy. An excise tax, for example, is imposed on a 
specific good such as cigarettes or alcohol, and it reduces the 
consumption of that good. An income tax, as the name im-
plies, lets the government take a percentage of pay. Because 
wages are the price of labor, an income tax reduces the 
amount of labor supplied and demanded, though the precise 
size of this effect is subject to controversy among econo-
mists. And a carbon tax, as we will discuss in Chapter 19, 
gives utilities, businesses, and individuals an incentive to 
use fuels that put fewer greenhouse gases into the 
atmosphere.
But no matter which tax the government uses to raise 
revenue, the implication is the same: the larger the gov-
ernment, the more revenue it needs to raise, and the 
greater the impact on the economy. The inevitable result 
of “too much” government intervention in the economy is 
a slowing of growth and a lower standard of living. But 
how much is “too much”? That’s the question economists 
disagree on.
THE RIGHT ROLE FOR 
GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC 
POLICY  LO6-4 
In the previous section, we saw that there are arguments for 
and against government intervention in the economy. So now 
we come to the critical question of economic policy: What is 
the right balance between the public and private sectors? We 
want to identify situations where markets fail to work as well 
as they might and where the pluses of government action out-
weigh the minuses.
Obviously, this is a question about which reasonable people 
might disagree. However, from an economic perspective, there 
are four main circumstances in which government economic 
intervention might be appropriate: public good provision, mar-
ket regulation, externalities, and income redistribution.
Public Good Provision
In the United States and most other developed countries, a 
long list of goods and services are provided to citizens, 
primarily by the government. These include national de-
fense, police and fire protection, the road system, ­primary 
and secondary education, and public health efforts such as 
clean water. Individuals and businesses can add extra 
goods and services to these if they want—say, 
by hiring private security or by paying to go 
to private schools—but the major responsibil-
ity for national security, minimum education, 
and the other items on this list falls to the 
government.
These expenditures provide what economists 
call public goods. Public goods are goods and 
services that benefit many people in a city, 
­region, or country—perhaps not equally, but 
to some degree. In contrast, the usual sorts of 
PUBLIC GOODS
Goods and services

region, or country.
SPOTLIGHT: DID THE 
GOVERNMENT CREATE  
THE INTERNET?
It’s hard to remember a time when the Internet didn’t ex-
ist. We take it for granted that we can turn on our comput-
ers and connect with other computers anywhere else in 
the world. Yet the communication protocols and stan-
dards enabling that miracle were encouraged and 
funded, in good part, by the federal government.
	
The key agency was the Advanced Research Proj-
ects Agency of the Defense Department, which first 
went by the acronym ARPA and then DARPA. Starting in 
the 1960s and continuing through the 1970s, DARPA 
funded the development of packet switching and the 
TCP/IP standards, which is the main way information is 
transmitted across the Internet. Then in the 1980s, the 
National Science Foundation helped fund the first large-
scale network, called NSFNET, and ensured that all 
computers followed the same communication protocol.
	
Today, of course, the physical elements of the Inter-
net—the fiber-optic cables, the network routes, the 
computers—are mostly privately owned and operated. 
Yet the standards that let all computers on the Internet 
communicate with each other are a public good that 
would have had a much tougher time coming into exis-
tence without government leadership.

invest in it. As a result, most spending on basic research 
comes from the government.
Once we get beyond a list of basic public goods, it be-
comes harder to find a political consensus about what the 
government should pay for. Here’s one controversial exam-
ple: education. Most people believe it’s appropriate for the 
government to provide at least a high school education for 
everyone. However, there is intense dispute about whether 
the government needs to actually run the schools or whether 
for you to pay $60,000 a year to hire 
that officer. However, you might be 
willing to band together with 100 
neighbors and pay $600 each. A public 
good needs to be paid for collectively 
because it benefits everyone.
But suppose you form a voluntary 
association to hire a police officer and 
one of your neighbors refuses to pay his share. After all, 
the cop on the corner will deter criminals whether or not 
your neighbor contributes anything. This is the free-rider 
problem. You can’t stop people from benefiting from a pub-
lic good even if they don’t pay and thus get a free ride from 
everyone else’s contributions. After a snowstorm, plowing 
the road benefits everyone who uses that road. National de-
fense benefits everyone who lives in a country; it’s not pos-
sible to selectively defend one person and not another.
The solution to the free-rider problem is government, 
which has the power to compel people to pay via taxes. Thus, 
instead of private associations paying private security guards, 
the local government generally supplies police, supported by 
taxes. Fire departments, highway departments, and many 
other collective activities are also supported by taxes.
Another government activity that falls into the class of a 
public good is the collection of weather data and basic 
weather forecasting. Because it benefits everyone to know 
when a hurricane or blizzard is coming, it makes sense for 
the government to handle this activity. (See “Economic 
Milestone: The First Weather Satellite.”)
Similarly, collecting basic economic data, such as the 
­unemployment rate, benefits everyone. A private company 
would never be able to make enough profit to cover the costs 
of surveying 60,000 households every month to get this 
­information. However, the benefits to society as a whole are 
high enough to make it worthwhile for us to allow the gov-
ernment to use tax revenues to provide this service.
One of the most important public goods the government 
provides is basic research. As we will see in Chapter 15, basic 
research—money spent on investigating fundamental 
­questions such as those in physics, chemistry, biology, or 
mathematics—is essential for the progress of science. 
­However, such basic research usually has no direct application 
in commercial products, so it’s hard for private companies to 
Economic Milestone
THE FIRST WEATHER 
SATELLITE
1960
One example of a public good is the collection of basic data about weather. 
The two cameras in the first weather satellite, TIROS-1, launched by the 
government on April 1, 1960, supplied the first continuous observations of 
global weather. Alas, TIROS-1 was not to have a long life, failing after only  
77 days. Today, the U.S. government has several civilian weather satellites in 
orbit, and their pictures and data are freely available to anyone. There are 
worries, however, that some of the satellites will soon fail, making it harder to 
forecast weather patterns.
SPOTLIGHT: PRIVATE  
TOLL ROADS
We’re used to thinking of highways as public goods, 
built and operated by state and local governments. Yet 
more and more states and municipalities, strapped for 
cash, are thinking about selling their toll roads to pri-
vate companies that will collect the fees and handle 
maintenance. For example, New Jersey at one point 
considered selling either the New Jersey Turnpike or 
the Garden State Parkway—two of the most heavily 
traveled roads in the country. In October 2012, a Span-
ish company opened up a private toll road near Austin, 
Texas, with an 85 mile-per-hour speed limit. 
	
The allure of private ownership is not only financial 
but also political. These roads need intensive mainte-
nance, which must be paid for with tolls. But a politician 
who tried to raise tolls would become the immediate 
target of irate voters, most of whom drive. A private 
owner, the theory goes, would find it easier to take the 
unpopular step of raising tolls.
	
Unfortunately, the high tolls on private roads have 
discouraged drivers and truck traffic, at least for now. 
The private toll road near Austin filed for bankruptcy in 
2016 (although it stayed open for use). No one yet 
knows whether private toll roads will turn out to be 
­politically acceptable in the long-run.

research at the Better Business Bureau 
or on the Internet.
But, in practice, it’s more workable 
for the government to provide and en-
force market regulation: the basic rules 
companies and industries have to follow. 
For example, ­consider things as simple 
as commercial transactions ­between 
companies and sales to consumers. Almost every state gov-
ernment has adopted some variant of the Uniform Commer-
cial Code (UCC), which lays out the basic rules for such 
transactions; these rules are enforced by the courts. The UCC 
includes ­important provisions such as the requirement that 
any goods sold be “fit for the ordinary purposes for which 
goods of that description are used.” In other words, if some-
one sells you something, it has to do what was promised.
The government regulates, loosely or tightly, virtually every 
aspect of the economy. As we will see in Chapter 13, govern-
ment regulators keep a close watch on the financial system, in-
cluding banks, insurance companies, and investment banks. 
State and federal regulators try to monitor the safety of products 
ranging from toys to cars (at the federal level, that’s the job of 
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration). The mar-
keting and development of new drugs and medical devices, the 
allocation of frequencies for different wireless devices, and the 
negotiation of trade treaties with other countries all fall under 
the jurisdiction of one or more regulators, as Table 6.3 shows.
it should just provide funding that families could use to pay 
for either a public or a private education for their children.
Or consider the public provision of wireless broadband 
service. Many cities and towns have considered setting up 
their own free or low-cost mobile broadband networks for 
residents. However, it’s not clear whether it makes sense for 
a city to spend taxpayer money to compete with the private-
sector telecom companies.
Finally, the question of how much of basic health care 
and retirement needs should be funded by the government 
will continue to be controversial. We will examine this ques-
tion in Chapter 18.
Market Regulation
Markets don’t govern themselves. They run by rules that de-
termine which actions are legal and fair—and which count 
as unfair or against the public interest. For example, it’s il-
legal for a supermarket to use scales that give the wrong 
weights. It’s also illegal for pharmaceutical companies to 
sell drugs that have not passed government safety standards. 
And “lemon laws” let buyers return cars that have to be re-
peatedly repaired for the same problems.
In theory, markets can enforce their own rules, up to a 
point. Trade associations can set rules that member compa-
nies have to follow. Consumers can choose not to patronize 
supermarkets that use unfair scales. Companies that make 
­unsafe products acquire a bad reputation that consumers can

Government and the Economy
ANTITRUST LAW
Government regulation 
intended to maintain 
competitive markets 
and discourage unfair 
accumulation of mar-
ket power.
EXTERNALITY
The impact that the 
actions of an individ-
ual or business can 
have on others.
NEGATIVE 
EXTERNALITIES
An undesirable impact 
that an economic activ-
ity can have on others.
Is it legal to own a nuclear power plant in your base-
ment? What rules govern private space travel? If you 
copy music onto your phone, are you breaking the law? 
What are the rules for drones? Should humans be al-
lowed to clone themselves?
	
One of the toughest tasks for government is regulat-
ing new technology. Economic progress is driven by 
technological change. But the dangers of new technol-
ogy are usually unknown and potentially serious.
	
Everyone agrees that the government has the right 
to regulate technologies that could harm others—that 
nuclear power plant in your basement, for example, 
which could affect your neighbors. People also accept 
that the government needs to be able to control which 
new pharmaceuticals can be sold to patients. The Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all drugs to 
pass safety tests and to be shown to actually work on 
people as promised.
	
Or take drones—small “unmanned aircraft systems,” 
as they are called by the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion (FAA). As drones have become more popular, the 
FAA has been issuing safety and operating regulations. 
One goal: to keep drones away from areas where they 
could be a danger to aircraft.
HOW IT WORKS: REGULATING 
NEW TECHNOLOGY
Let’s focus on two particular in-
stances of regulation. The Federal 
Trade Commission (FTC) and the De-
partment of Justice enforce antitrust 
law. Antitrust law is designed to ensure 
that companies don’t unfairly try to get 
market power or reduce the amount of 
competition in a market or industry. 
These agencies have to approve large 
mergers and acquisitions that compa-
nies want to make so the government 
can ensure that the number of competi-
tors in a market doesn’t get too small. 
They watch for signs of collusion, a 
scheme in which competitors get to-
gether and try to push up prices. In 
other words, these government agen-
cies are the defenders of competition.
For example, in 2011, the Department of Justice filed to 
block AT&T’s proposed purchase of T-Mobile USA, a large 
national provider of mobile phone service. In addition, the 
FCC was also worried about the competitive implications of 
the purchase. As a result of the government opposition, 
AT&T withdrew the purchase offer.
While the government monitors the fairness of domestic 
markets, it is also responsible for keeping an eye on interna-
tional markets. The central government of each country has 
the primary responsibility for negotiating its own rules for 
trade—which types of beef can be imported, which airlines 
can fly from London to New York, and whether foreign 
banks can buy up domestic banks.
The regulatory role of government is always changing 
with the economy. The Great Recession brought new calls 
for regulation of home mortgages, and the development of 
new technologies requires new types of regulation as well. 
(See “How It Works: Regulating New Technology.”) In ev-
ery case, however, the need is to balance the benefit of regu-
lation with the harm it might cause.
Externalities
The basic logic behind the success of a market economy is 
that when consumers and businesses strive to do the best for 
themselves, they benefit the entire economy. Thus, a profit-
maximizing company competes by cutting costs, introducing 
better products, and otherwise behaving in a way that im-
proves the output of the economy.
That reasoning breaks down, however, if individual actions 
have side effects on others. For ­example, if you put a 20-foot-
high flamingo statue in your front yard, it may please your 
artistic sensibilities. But it will negatively affect the views of 
your neighbors and perhaps reduce the values of their homes.
Economists call such secondary consequences of actions 
externalities. More precisely, an externality is the impact 
that the actions of an individual or business can have on 
­others. Externalities can be either bad (negative) or good 
(positive). The classic example of a negative externality is 
pollution. A factory that emits noxious fumes is imposing a 
negative externality on nearby neighborhoods. In the 2011 
Fukushima disaster in Japan, a tsunami from a strong earth-
quake caused several nuclear reactors to melt down. This 
imposed a negative externality on people living in a wide 
Pollution is a negative externality.

POSITIVE EXTERNALITY
A desirable impact that 
an economic activity 
can have on others.
NETWORK

How the decision of a 
person to use a net-
work affects the value 
of that network to 
other people.

ring income from

households to low- 
income households.
area around the affected areas, who were forced to perma-
nently evacuate. On a more mundane level, if you insist on 
playing loud music late at night, you are imposing a negative 
externality on your neighbors. An airport imposes a negative 
externality on nearby residents in the form of noise from air-
planes taking off and landing.
One of the most annoying externalities is an out-of-con-
trol car alarm. People buy alarms to deter thieves, which is 
an individual benefit. However, when a car alarm goes off in 
the middle of the night, it imposes negative externalities on 
everyone around—especially if it continues for a long time.
Positive externalities come about when your actions ben-
efit other people. Suppose you have a sidewalk in front of 
your house that your neighbors also use. If you shovel your 
walk when it snows, that helps not just you but your neigh-
bors, too. Similarly, if you paint your house, its added attrac-
tiveness helps increase the property values of your neighbors.
Here’s another example of a positive externality. In the 
early days of the Internet, only a few people had e-mail ac-
counts, and they could send e-mail only to each other. Now 
suppose you’ve just signed up with an Internet service pro-
vider for the first time. Suddenly, your friends and business 
associates who already have accounts can e-mail you, so 
their connections have become more valuable to them. In 
effect, your decision to pay for an Internet account has a 
positive impact on the people already on the Internet. This is 
what is known as a network externality: your decision to 
use a network affects the value of that network to other peo-
ple. Social media such as Facebook show the same positive 
network externalities. 
There can be negative network externalities as well. If you 
decide to drive on a crowded highway during rush hour, the 
additional congestion you create may slow down other cars on 
the highway. This can be a big deal. If a road is close to capac-
ity, then just a few additional cars can sharply slow down traf-
fic and turn an orderly flow of cars into a traffic jam.
One important purpose of government is to convince peo-
ple and businesses to do fewer of the things that create nega-
tive externalities and more of the things that create positive 
externalities. For example, environmental regulations limit 
the amount of pollution a factory or a car can produce. 
(We’ll talk more about the environment in Chapter 19.) 
­Zoning regulations prevent ugly industrial buildings from 
being constructed in residential neigh-
borhoods. Building codes that reduce 
the risk your house will catch fire in-
crease your safety, as well as the safety 
of your neighbors. Some highways im-
pose higher tolls during rush hour as a 
way of persuading drivers to use the 
road at a less congested time. In effect, 
the higher tolls represent the extra costs 
each driver imposes on other vehicles.
Income Redistribution
A final important economic function of 
government is income redistribution—
shifting money from rich to poor to 
close big income differences. Redistri-
bution can take place through the tax 
system, through the distribution of ben-
efits such as Medicare and food stamps, 
or through direct transfer of money such as unemployment 
insurance payments or income support for poor children.
This is one of the most controversial economic policy 
topics. Should the government help the poor? Some say, of 
course. Others say government’s main responsibility is to 
provide opportunities for people who are willing to work 
hard, not to provide handouts. There are good arguments on 
both sides. In Chapter 17, we will look at income inequality 
and redistribution in much more detail.
CONCLUSION
As we’ve gone through this chapter, we’ve given the argu-
ments, pro and con, for government intervention in individ-
ual markets. It’s not a debate that can end in a clean knockout 
for either side. Each individual case, whether it’s tighter 
regulation of the mortgage market or requiring more tests for 
new drugs, has advantages and disadvantages.
However, taking a broader perspective, there’s one area 
where everyone can agree government has a key role: pro-
viding the economic statistics that enable policymakers, 
politicians, and businesses to know how the economy is do-
ing. The next chapter begins our study of macroeconomics 
by looking at how we measure the size of the economy.

SUMMARY
	 1.	Today, the hand of the government is apparent in every 
corner of the economy. But before the Great Depres-
sion started in 1929, government had a much smaller 
role. During the Great Depression, President Franklin 
Roosevelt put into place a wide variety of new programs 
under the collective name of the New Deal. (LO6-1)
	 2.	After the Depression and World War II ended, govern-
ment spending and employment dropped but did not 
return to their pre-1929 share of the economy. In fact, 
government’s role in the economy gradually ex-
panded through the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Start-
ing in the mid-1970s, the public began to feel that

PROBLEMS
government intervention in the economy had gone far 
enough. This was the beginning of the era of deregu-
lation. (LO6-1)
	 3.	The advantage of government intervention in the 
economy is that it directs economic activities to 
achieve desirable goals. This is often called the com-
mand-and-control approach to social and economic 
goals. (LO6-2)
	 4.	The disadvantages include the incentive problem, 
rent-seeking behavior, and corruption. In addition, 
­using taxes to raise revenues causes fewer goods and 
services to be produced and sold than would other-
wise be the case. This is known as the inefficiency of 
taxation. (LO6-3)
	 5.	The critical question of economic policy is finding the 
right balance between the public and private sectors. 
There are four circumstances when government inter-
vention in the economy might be appropriate: public 
good provision, market regulation, externalities, and 
income redistribution. (LO6-4)

b)	 Charging a fee for use of a park.
	
c)	 Raising taxes to pay for a new bridge.
	
d)	 Offering low-interest loans to students.
	 5.	The local government needs to replace all its traffic signals. Two companies are competing for this 
business. Company A spends $100,000 on buying a new, more efficient machine to make traffic sig-
nals. Company B spends $100,000 on campaign contributions for the city council. (LO6-3)

seeking behavior, or monopoly?
	
b)	 Is Company B likely to charge a higher or a lower price for the traffic signals than Company A?
	
c)	 Would the taxpayers of the town prefer that Company A or Company B win the contract? Would 
the city council prefer that Company A or Company B win the contract?
	 6.	Suppose the government taxes food according to its fat content. That is, the more fat a food contains, 
the higher the tax on it. (LO6-3)

goods and services. (LO6-3)
	
a)	 Suppose a student sends 10 e-mail messages, 15 text messages, and 25 instant messages each 
day. How much tax would be paid?

tion? (More than one reason might apply in each case.) Explain your answers. (LO6-4)
	
a)	 New York City bans smoking in restaurants.
	
b)	 Congress renews the food stamp program, which gives poor people access to groceries at a discount.
	
c)	 Local governments open libraries that are available to anyone.
	 9.	Communities sometimes take on large amounts of debt to build a new baseball or football stadium. 
The expectation is that a professional sports team can help create new jobs, give an area more visibil-
ity, and attract new businesses. (LO6-4)
	
a)	 Is this example of government action—taking on debt to pay for a sports stadium—an example of 
a public good, an externality, regulation, or redistribution?
	
b)	 Using the concepts in this chapter, explain why government funding of a new sports stadium might 
not produce the desired results.
	10.	In 2008, then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed congestion pricing for New York City streets. Con-

d)	 Under what conditions is a congestion tax a good idea?

E
arlier in this textbook, we laid out the basics of microeconomics: supply and 
demand, market equilibrium, profit maximization, and competition and mar-
ket power. In this appendix, we will explore several key topics in consumer 
choice and business decision making in more depth. These will help us under-
stand some important issues and problems in today’s economy.
First, we will lay out the logic of utility maximization, which helps explain where 
the demand curve comes from and how consumers react to price changes. That 
will give us some insight into how consumers change their behavior in response 
to big changes in prices for items such as food and energy.
We’ll also take a deeper look at demand elasticity.
In the second half of this appendix, we’ll examine the process of profit 
maximization, including how managers choose the best production techniques 
and where the cost function comes from. This will give us some insight into how 
companies make crucial production decisions, such as whether to move their 
operations to other countries.
We will finish the appendix by using the concepts of demand and supply 
elasticities to better understand who bears the burden of different taxes. In other words, when a tax is raised or lowered, 
who benefits and who loses? This is an important question as politicians debate future changes in the tax code.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After you read this appendix 
you should be able to: 
LO6A-1	Explain the role of 
utility maximization in 
consumer choice, and 
use the concept of 
price elasticity of 
demand.
LO6A-2	Explain the role of 
cost minimization in 
producer decisions, 
and use the concept 
of price elasticity of 
supply.
LO6A-3	Explain the incidence 
of a tax.
APPENDIX
DELVING DEEPER INTO 
MICROECONOMICS
CONSUMER  
CHOICE  LO6A-1 
We will start by developing a framework for un-
derstanding consumer choice. Recall that in 
Chapter 2, we described the demand schedule for 
buyers in a market. But now we are asking an ad-
ditional question: Where does a demand schedule 
come from? Getting the answer to this question is 
important for any company 
that makes or sells a con-
sumer product such as 
shampoo, sports equipment, or motor ve-
hicles. More importantly, it also helps us 
better understand the economy we live in.
The Utility Function
To understand consumer decision mak-
ing, economists generally start with the 
idea that each person has a utility 
function. You can think of a utility function as 
a little internal computer that accurately re-
flects a person’s likes and dislikes. Given the 
actual goods and services the person is con-
suming, the utility function spits out a number 
that reflects the physical and emotional bene-
fits the person gets—in other words, the utility 
of the person’s consumption. A higher number 
is preferable, of course.
Each person’s utility function is likely to be 
different. So, for example, if you like football 
games but don’t care for opera, your utility func-
tion will give a strong positive weight to attendance at this 
weekend’s football game and a negative weight to attendance 
at the opera. 
The utility function also tells us how much benefit a 
person gets from purchasing and consuming more of the 
same thing—say, one car versus two cars or one television 
versus two televisions. For example, we can write a utility 
function for a typical coffee drinker in Table 6A.1. The 
first column of the table shows the number of cups of

his or her utility.

physical and emo-

MARGINAL UTILITY
The added amount of 
utility an individual 
gets from one more 
unit of consumption of 
a good or service, 
holding everything 
else constant.
DIMINISHING 
MARGINAL UTILITY
The tendency for mar-
ginal utility to decline 
as the consumption of 
a good or service 
increases.
BUDGET CONSTRAINT
The combinations of 
goods and services an 
individual is able to 
buy, given prices and 
the amount of money 
available to spend.
RATIONAL INDIVIDUAL
A person who maxi-
mizes his or her utility, 
subject to a budget 
constraint.
­coffee the person drinks in a day. The second column 
shows the utility she derives from those cups of coffee.
One cup of coffee might give the person four units of util-
ity (which economists sometimes call utils). Two cups a day 
give her seven total units of utility, and three cups give her 
nine units of utility.
We define marginal utility as the added amount of utility 
an individual gets from one more unit of consumption, hold-
ing everything else constant. For example, in Table 6A.1 the 
marginal utility from the third cup of coffee is two, which is 
the difference between the utility for the third cup (nine) and 
the second cup (seven). Similarly, the marginal utility from 
the fourth cup of coffee is one.
Table 6A.1 also illustrates the concept of ­diminishing 
marginal utility—the tendency for marginal utility to de-
cline as consumption increases. That’s typical for most 
goods and services: the more of a good you consume, the 
less added benefit from increasing your consumption.
The Budget Constraint
Your utility function is important to your spending deci-
sions, but it’s certainly not the only factor that determines 
what and how much you buy. Your ­budget constraint tells 
you what combinations of goods and services you are able to 
buy, given the prices and the amount of money you have 
available to spend. The rational individual maximizes her 
utility, subject to her budget constraint.
For example, suppose your entertainment budget for 
the month is $60. You are going to spend that on some 
combination of going to the movies and eating out.  
The local movie theater charges $10 per ticket, whereas 
the local restaurant charges $20 for a dinner. Given the 
amount of money you have available, you want to make 
choices that give you the highest util-
ity. For example, if you love movies, 
you might decide to go to one movie 
every week of the month ($10 × 4  
= $40) and go out to eat once ($20), 
thus using your budget of $60. Some-
one else with the same ­budget con-
straint might decide to go to the 
movies twice ($10 × 2 = $20) and go 
out to eat twice ($20 × 2 = $40).
The budget constraint changes 
when the prices do. If the restaurant 
in Table 6A.2 were to cut its price to 
$15 per meal, your set of affordable 
combinations would expand. If you 
didn’t go to any movies, you could go 
out to eat four times a month rather 
than three. Or if you had been eating 
out twice and seeing two movies, now 
you could eat out twice and see three 
movies and still stay within your 
budget.
The budget constraint also changes 
when the amount of money you can 
spend goes up or down. If you had $80 
available for movies and eating out, 
that would give you a different set of 
choices.

Government and the Economy
Now we need to make these concepts more precise by as-
signing a number to elasticity. The price elasticity of demand 
is the percentage change in quantity demanded that results 
from a 1 percent change in price. This will almost always be 
a negative number because an increase in price reduces the 
quantity demanded. But, by convention, economists usually 
just drop the negative sign and talk about price elasticity as a 
number.
For example, a price elasticity of 1 means that a 10 per-
cent price increase leads to a 10 percent decrease in quantity 
demanded. An elasticity of 2 means that a 10 percent price 
increase leads to a 20 percent decrease in quantity ­demanded. 
An elasticity of 0.5 means that a 10 percent price increase 
leads to a 5 percent decrease in quantity demanded. In 
­general, a good or service has inelastic demand if its price 
elasticity is less than 1, and has elastic demand if its price 
elasticity is greater than 1. (If it’s exactly 1, we say that it has 
unit elasticity.)
Economists have estimated price elasticities for various 
goods and services. According to the Department of Agri-
culture, the price elasticity of food in the United States is 
close to 0.1, which makes it highly inelastic. That means if 
the price of food goes up by 10 percent, the quantity of food 
demanded decreases by less than 1 percent. As a result, 
changes in the price of food do not have very much impact 
on the overall consumption of food.
Most studies find that the price elasticity of gasoline is 
around 0.25. That is, if the price of gasoline goes up by 
10 percent, the quantity demanded drops by about 2.5 per-
cent. (That’s over about a year or so. There’s a bigger impact 
if we look further out because people switch to cars with 
lower fuel consumption.)
The price elasticity of demand can be applied to either an 
individual demand curve or a market demand curve. Table 
6A.3 illustrates how a single individual’s consumption of 
gasoline changes with price.
Utility Maximization
A rational individual will choose goods and services to max-
imize utility, subject to his or her budget constraint. Because 
of diminishing marginal utility, you are likely to choose a 
combination of goods and services rather than blowing all 
your money on one item. To put it a different way: even if 
you enjoy riding roller coasters, and even if you say that rid-
ing roller coasters is your favorite thing to do, you are un-
likely to want to ride roller coasters 12 hours a day, seven 
days a week. Diminishing marginal utility sets in quickly.
So the utility-maximizing decision is really about trade-
offs, taking your budget constraint into account. Do you 
want to spend $5 on riding the roller coaster one more time, 
or would you rather use that money for two ice cream cones? 
Would you rather buy a used car or have enough money to 
take a trip? Would you rather spend money on a textbook or 
spend the same money on an extra cup of Starbucks coffee 
each week?
In each such case, you are weighing the marginal utility 
of spending your last dollar on one good or service versus 
another. If you can raise your utility by switching to another 
combination of goods and services while sticking to your 
budget constraint, you will.
The utility-maximizing decision depends on the prices of 
the goods and services you are ­considering. If a price of a 
good or service changes, so will the budget constraint and 
the trade-offs that you have to make.
Price Elasticity of Demand
One of the key elements of economics 
is being able to quantify behavior. 
Among other things, we can measure 
the size and growth of the economy, the 
rate of change of prices, and the ups 
and downs of the stock market.
We can also quantify the reaction of 
consumers to big changes in prices. 
That’s critical these days, when we 
have seen big swings in the price of es-
sentials like food and gasoline. How 
much will the quantity demanded 
change when prices go up or down?
In Chapter 3, we examined the link 
between a price change and the reac-
tions of buyers and sellers. We said that 
demand is elastic if a small price change 
produces a big change in quantity de-
manded. One example is restaurant 
meals, for which demand drops sharply 
as price increases. Demand is inelastic 
if a big price change produces only a 
small change in quantity demanded, as 
is true of gasoline. (We’ll consider elas-
ticity of supply later in this appendix).
PRICE ELASTICITY  
OF DEMAND
The percentage 
change in quantity de-
manded that results 
from a 1 percent 
change in price.
INELASTIC DEMAND
A situation where the 
quantity demanded 
does not change much 
even if the price 
changes significantly. 
More precisely, a situa-
tion where the price 
elasticity of demand is 
less than 1.
ELASTIC DEMAND
Intuitively, a situation 
in which a small 
change in price has a 
big impact on quantity 
demanded. More pre-
cisely, a situation in 
which the price elas-
ticity of demand is 
greater than 1.

Economic studies suggest that the price elasticity of gasoline 
in the short run is 0.25. That means a 10 percent increase in 
price will lead to a 2.5 percent decrease in the quantity de-
manded. In this example, the price increases by 10 percent 
from $3.00 to $3.30. The quantity demanded decreases by 
2.5 percent from 800 gallons per year to 780 gallons.

minimization. In fact, often the biggest 
difference between a successful busi-
ness and an unsuccessful business is 
which one does a better job of cost 
minimization.
Remember that a business usually 
has more than one way to produce the 
same output. For example, if you have a lawn-
mowing business, you can use an army of 
workers equipped with hand mowers or one 
worker with a tractor. So your first step is to 
figure out which combination of inputs pro-
duces the desired output at the lowest cost. This 
cost-minimizing choice depends on the wages 
of the workers and the cost of the tractor and 
the gasoline needed to run it.
Or imagine you are the top executive of a 
small company creating and selling funny 
greeting cards. You have to ask the cost minimization ques-
tions first: Is it cheaper to print the cards in the United States 
or overseas? Is it cheaper to have a staff of trained greeting 
card writers, or should you buy the copy inside the cards 
from freelancers? Obviously, the answers to these questions 
depend on the prices of inputs such as labor, printing, and 
international shipping.
We will first consider how businesses achieve cost mini-
mization. Then in the next section, we will look at pricing 
and output decisions.
Starting from a particular combination of price and quan-
tity, inelastic demand results in a more vertical demand 
curve than elastic demand. To see this, let’s start with Fig-
ure 6A.1, which shows the demand curve that corresponds 
to Table 6A.3. Starting from the price of $3.00 per gallon 
and 800 gallons consumed, a 10 percent increase in the price 
results in a 2.5 percent decrease in the quantity demanded. 
This represents a price elasticity of 0.25, which indicates in-
elastic demand.
Now let’s assume that the price elasticity of 
gasoline suddenly jumps from 0.25 to 2—that is, 
from inelastic to elastic. Starting from the same 
combination of $3.00 per gallon and 800 gallons 
consumed, a 10 percent increase in price now re-
sults in a 20 percent decrease in the quantity de-
manded. Consumption of gasoline now drops 
from 800 gallons per year to 640 gallons per year, 
as shown in Figure 6A.2, and the demand curve 
is less vertical.
PRODUCER DECISIONS  LO6A-2 
Now we shift our analysis from the demand side of the mar-
ket to the supply side. In Chapter 4, we described the cost 
function, which reports how much it costs to produce each 
level of output. We used that information to analyze the pro-
cess of profit maximization.
But where does the cost function come from? For any 
given level of output, managers have to figure out the least 
expensive production method. That process is known as cost

ing the lowest-cost 
way of producing a 
given level of output.
This figure shows the demand curve corresponding to Table 
6A.3. With a price elasticity of demand of 0.25, a big percent-
age change in price produces a small change in quantity.

example, historically trucks were complements to truck driv-
ers. If the price of trucks fell, freight companies would buy 
more trucks, which would increase the demand for truck 
drivers. But going forward, it’s only a matter of time before 
we see self-driving trucks. As the price of self-driving falls, 
the demand for truck drivers will fall as well. 
A Cost Minimization Example
Let’s work through a simple example of cost minimization: 
If you are running a business, should you buy your own 
copy machine or send your documents out to a local copy 
shop? That’s a decision many small businesses must make. 
If you buy a copy machine, you have to lay out anywhere 
from $200 to $1,200, depending on the speed and capacity 
of the machine you choose. And then there’s the cost of the 
toner and paper, which could be 2–4 cents per copy. The al-
ternative, of course, is to send the copying out, which could 
cost 10 cents or more per copy, depending on the quantity.
To make this decision, of course, we need to know the 
actual cost of the machine and the price per copy. Table 
6A.4 works through the cost minimization decision, 
­assuming the cost of a copy machine is $300, the per-page 
Choosing the Right Inputs
To see a simple example of cost minimization, let’s think 
about a lawn-mowing service (also discussed back in Chap-
ter 4). Suppose the business owner has agreed to cut 20 
lawns a day in the neighborhood. Now he has a choice: He 
can hire five workers at the minimum wage (roughly $60 per 
day for each) with push mowers to do the task. Or he can 
hire one worker and rent a riding mower to cut the same 
20 lawns. Which method should he choose?
The answer depends on the price of renting the riding 
mower. The option of hiring the five workers will cost $300 
per day ($60 × 5). The option of renting the riding mower will 
be the daily rental cost of the mower plus the labor cost of one 
worker, which is $60. So renting the mower will be the pre-
ferred option as long as its rental cost is less than $240 per day 
($300 − $60). But if the mower costs more than $240 per day, 
it’s not worth it.
In general, a producer’s choice of inputs depends on its 
relative prices. As an input becomes more expensive, all 
other things being equal, a business will want to use less of it. 
If you are running a factory and the cost of providing health 
care for your U.S. workers goes up, you’re likely to reduce 
the number of U.S. workers by automating the assembly line 
or by moving the operation to China or Vietnam. If the cost 
of renting office space rises compared to other inputs, you’ll 
put your workers in cubicles rather than offices, or you’ll buy 
your workers laptops and have them work from home.
Substitutes and Complements  
in Production
We say that one input is a substitute for another if, when the 
price of one goes up, a cost-minimizing business uses more 
of the other (holding output constant). For example, factory 
workers in China are generally thought of as substitutes for 
factory workers in the United States. Voice-mail systems are 
substitutes for secretaries. Teleconferencing is a substitute 
for air travel.
Sometimes, though, two inputs work together, so if you use 
less of one, you will use less of the other as well. We say that 
one input is a complement for another if when the price of 
one goes up, a cost-minimizing business 
will use less of the other (holding output 
constant). For example, freight transpor-
tation is a complement for foreign work-
ers because, if the price of shipping 
freight across the ocean goes up, there is 
less incentive to move production over-
seas. Cement is a complement for con-
struction workers because as the price of 
cement goes up, less building occurs, 
and therefore, fewer workers are needed.
Sometimes, technological changes 
may change two inputs from being 
complements to being substitutes. For 
SUBSTITUTE
Two inputs are substi-
tutes if a business will 
use more of one when 
the price of the other 
rises.
COMPLEMENTS
Two inputs that are 
used together, such 
that when the price of 
one goes up, a cost-
minimizing business 
uses less of the other.
TABLE 6A.4
The Copier Decision
Few small businesses can avoid the important copier deci-
sion: should they buy their own copy machines, with big up-
front outlays and low per-page costs? Or should they use a 
local copy shop, with no start-up cost but a high per-page 
cost? The answer depends on the relative costs of the two 
options and the number of copies needed. The shaded re-
gions represent the low-cost choices for selected copy vol-
umes. For low volumes, the outside copy shop is preferable. 
For high volumes, buying a copier is better.

Price Elasticity of Supply
In Chapter 3, we said that supply is elastic if a small price change 
leads to a large change in the quantity supplied. Similarly, supply is 
inelastic if a big price change leads to only a small change in the 
quantity supplied.
However, just as in the case of demand elasticity, we can be 
more precise. The price elasticity of supply is the percentage 
increase in the quantity supplied, given a 
1 percent increase in the price. The price 
elasticity of supply is generally a posi-
tive number because the supply curve is 
usually upward-sloping. For example, if 
the price elasticity of supply is 3, a 10 
percent price increase will lead to a 30 
percent increase in the quantity sup-
plied. Elastic supply means that the 
price elasticity of supply is greater than 
1, and inelastic supply means that the 
price elasticity of supply is less than 1. 
Perfectly inelastic supply refers to the 
situation where the price elasticity of 
supply is zero—that is, if the quantity 
supplied doesn’t change, no matter how 
the price changes.
Figures 6A.3, 6A.4 and 6A.5 show, 
respectively, elastic supply, inelastic 
supply, and perfectly inelastic supply. 
Each figure starts from the same com-
bination of price P and quantity Q, 
and shows the reaction to the same 
price change P to P′. The change in 
quantity is biggest in Figure 6A.3, 
smaller in Figure 6A.4, and 
­nonexistent in Figure 6A.5. Starting 
from the same P and Q, the supply 
curve is more vertical when elasticity is 
smaller. In the case of perfectly inelas-
tic supply, the supply curve is vertical.
cost if you own the machine is 2 cents per copy, and the per-
page cost if you go to an outside shop is 10 cents per copy.
The calculations in the table show that for low volumes of 
copies, it’s cheaper to use an outside copy shop. But once the 
volume gets high enough, buying a copy machine makes sense. 
The result is a cost function: For any level of output, we can tell 
what the cost will be. Producing 3,000 copies, for example, will 
cost $300. Producing 4,000 copies will cost $380.
In general, the best choice of inputs depends on the price 
of inputs and on a producer’s expected scale of output. In the 
example just given, the decision of whether to buy a copy 
machine depends on how many copies you plan to make, 
holding input prices fixed. Similarly, in the case of the 
­lawn-mowing company, the decision of whether to buy a 
tractor depends on how many lawns you need to mow, as well 
as on the relative prices of buying a tractor and renting it.
It’s not unusual for the right mix of inputs for a small 
business to change as the business expands. A very small 
business may operate out of a spare bedroom, but a business 
with 10 employees needs its own office. A small business 
hires a part-time accountant; a bigger business has an in-
house finance and legal department. These sorts of transi-
tions make operating a business challenging.

prices by the amount of the tax because drivers won’t have 
any choice but to pay the higher prices.
To put this a different way, if demand is inelastic, buyers 
have few alternatives, and they won’t be able to object if 
sellers try to boost prices to pass along a tax. On the other 
hand, if supply is inelastic, sellers will be forced to absorb a 
tax themselves.
Figure 6A.6 shows the effect of taxing a 
market in which demand is inelastic and sup-
ply is elastic, as is true for gasoline. In other 
words, purchasers don’t have other choices, 
but sellers do. The tax shows up as the differ-
ence between what buyers pay and what sell-
ers ­ultimately receive. But the impact is bigger on buyers 
than on sellers. In Figure 6A.6, the after-tax price to buyers 
rises a lot, whereas the after-tax price paid to sellers barely 
drops.
However, this may not be the final word on the inci-
dence of the tax. There can be a difference between short-
run and long-run elasticity in a market. Even if buyers 
don’t have many options in the short run, in the long run, 
they may be able to make big changes. Faced with higher 
gas taxes, for example, drivers will eventually buy more 
fuel-efficient cars, take public transportation, switch jobs 
to avoid long commutes, or move closer to their jobs. So, 
in the short run, a gasoline tax falls on drivers, but in the 
long run, it may fall on the sellers of gasoline.
CONCLUSION
The fundamental lesson of this appendix is that as prices 
change, so does the behavior of consumers and businesses. 
The better we can understand these reactions, the better we 
can understand the economy around us. That’s the virtue and 
importance of a deeper look at microeconomics.
TAX INCIDENCE AND  
ELASTICITY  LO6A-3 
Politicians are always talking about raising or cutting taxes. In 
fact, Congress seems to pass some kind of tax change every 
year, which affects the amount that businesses and households 
have to pay the government.
But one of the big surprises of economics is 
that the ultimate incidence or burden of the tax 
may not fall on the ­person or company writing 
the check. Instead, it depends on the elasticity 
of supply and the elasticity of demand.
For example, suppose a local government 
levies a $5 tax per pair of shoes sold, to be collected from 
shoe stores. It might seem at first that shoe stores are being 
hurt by the tax. But the stores may try to pass the tax on to 
consumers by raising the prices of shoes by $5. If they are 
successful, consumers will pay the shoe tax. Tax incidence 
identifies the individuals or businesses that ultimately have 
to bear the burden of a tax, whether or not they are the ones 
that actually write the checks to the government.
But here’s the question that elasticity can help us answer: 
When can we pass a tax on to someone else? If you were the 
one being taxed, when could you get someone else to pay? 
The ultimate incidence of a tax depends on which side of the 
­market—buyers or ­sellers—is more inelastic. For example, 
suppose the product is something buyers absolutely need, at 
least in the short run—say, gasoline to drive their cars to 
work. Now suppose the government in-
creases the tax on gasoline (as of late 
2015, the average tax on gasoline in the 
United States, a combination of federal 
and state taxes, was about 49 cents per 
gallon). Then, in the short run, gas sta-
tions will be able to simply boost their

SUMMARY
	 1.	A utility function reports a number that reflects the phys-
ical and emotional benefits a person gets from consum-
ing different combinations of goods and services. Every 
person’s utility function is different. Typically, people get 
diminishing marginal utility from increasing consumption 
of the same good or service. (LO6A-1)
	 2.	A budget constraint tells you what combinations of 
goods and services you can buy, given their prices 
and the amount of money you have available to 
spend. A rational person maximizes his or her utility 
subject to the budget constraint, which requires mak-
ing trade-offs between different goods and services. 
(LO6A-1)
	 3.	The price elasticity of demand measures the response 
of quantity demanded to price changes of a good or 
service. It is the percentage change in quantity de-
manded that results from a 1 percent change in price. 
Demand is inelastic if the price elasticity is less than 1, 
and it’s elastic if the price elasticity is greater than 1. 
(LO6A-1)
	 4.	For any given level of output, the managers of a busi-
ness have to figure out the least ­expensive produc-
tion method. The cost-minimizing combination of 
inputs depends on the prices of the inputs. Two inputs 
are substitutes if raising the price of one increases the 
use of the other, holding output constant. Two inputs 
are complements if raising the price of one decreases 
the use of the other, holding output constant. 
(LO6A-2)
	 5.	The price elasticity of supply is the percentage in-
crease in the quantity supplied, given a 1 percent  
increase in the price. Supply is elastic if the elasticity 
is greater than 1, and it’s inelastic if the elasticity is less 
than 1. Supply is perfectly inelastic if the elasticity is 
zero—that is, if a change in price does not change the 
quantity supplied. (LO6A-2)
	 6.	The incidence of a tax reflects who ultimately absorbs 
the burden of the tax. In general, the incidence of a 
tax depends on which side of the market—buyers or 
sellers—is more ­inelastic. (LO6A-3)
PROBLEMS
	 1.	Diminishing marginal utility means that  
 (LO6A-1)
	
a)	 marginal utility falls as consumption increases.
	
b)	 marginal utility gets smaller over time.
	
c)	 utility falls as consumption increases.
	
d)	 utility gets smaller over time.

d)	 What was the original revenue of the auto dealership from sports car sales? What is the new

	 5.	The price of homes affects the number of new homes built—the higher the price rises, the more new 
homes are built. Economic literature suggests that a reasonable value for the price elasticity of supply 
for home construction is 3, so a 1 percent price increase generates a 3 percent increase in new home 
construction. (LO6A-2)
	
a)	 Suppose the average price of homes in a town is $300,000, and 200 new homes are constructed 
in the town each year. Now suppose the average price of homes goes up to $330,000. What is 
the new rate of home construction per year?
	
b)	 Instead of rising, suppose the average price of homes in the town falls from $300,000 to

result of inelastic demand, elastic supply, elastic demand, or inelastic supply? Explain your answer.
	
b)	 Now suppose the town is in the middle of a densely populated region of the country, so it’s easy for 
food shoppers to go to stores in other towns. Is the burden of the tax more likely to fall on food stores 
or food purchasers? Is this the result of elastic demand, elastic supply, inelastic demand, or inelastic 
supply? Explain your answer.
	 7.	Economists disagree about the magnitude of elasticity of labor supply. The labor market is a key part of the 
economy. Workers choose how many hours they will work, or even if they are going to take a job at all, de-
pending on the wage they can get. The elasticity of labor supply tells us how much labor supply responds 
to changes in the wage. Some argue that it is quite low; others say that the elasticity of labor supply is much 
greater than 1.

have more effect on the wage received by workers, or on the quantity of labor supplied?

tention on the behavior of individual 
markets. We considered supply and demand 
in a single market, looked at profit-maximizing 
businesses, and discussed how government 
can affect a market.
	
Now we are going to take our first steps 
into macroeconomics—the study of the 
whole economy. This is the big picture that 
we read about online or see on television. 
What’s happening to unemployment? Is 
the economy heating up or slowing down? 
Are we slumping into a recession or going 
into a boom? And what should Congress, 
the president, or the chair of the Federal 
Reserve do about it?
	
Macroeconomics addresses these ques-
tions and more. Over the next six chapters, 
we will look at the core concepts of output, 
inflation, growth, and unemployment. We 
will discuss the Great ­Recession, how it hurt 
Americans, and what has happened since 
then. Then we will examine how govern-
ment spending and taxation can influence 
the economy and the impact the Federal

amount of freight being hauled by railroads or the amount of 
canned corn coming out of the nation’s factories (a whop-
ping 100 million cans in 1893, for those of you taking notes). 
But there was nothing anyone could point to and say, “This 
is how big the economy is.”
When the Great Depression arrived in 1929, it suddenly 
became more important for us to know how the economy 
was doing. As we saw in the previous chapter, the economy 
was very sick during that time. There were loud calls for the 
government to do something about it, and economists were 
forced to come up with new tools and new ways of thinking. 
For the first time we needed an overall measure of the econ-
omy to see how bad economic conditions were and whether 
they were getting better. In the 1930s, economist Simon 
Kuznets, who later won the Nobel Prize in Economics, 
worked with a small staff to construct the first overall mea-
sure of the U.S. economy.
Kuznets’s work represented a major breakthrough in eco-
nomics. However, it was just the start. Over the next 10 
years, the nation’s economic statistics steadily improved. 
One major motivation for improving economic analysis was 
the international conflict with Germany and Japan in the 
early 1940s. Government military planners needed to know 
how big the economy was so they could figure 
out how many tanks, ships, and planes it could 
produce.
By the time World War II ended in 1945, 
the foundations for the current system of gath-
ering economic statistics were in place. Today 
the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the 
Census Bureau, and the Federal Reserve are 
the main statistical agencies in Washington. 
They conduct surveys, collect information, 
and regularly publish reports on the key 
spend billions on new fighter planes can affect em-
ployment in the states where the planes are built. 
That increase in employment may affect the demand 
for new homes, which in turn may boost the demand 
for mortgage borrowing. Every part of the economy 
is interconnected.
	
The other reason for disagreement is the in-
tensely political nature of many macro policy deci-
sions. Republicans and Democrats in Washington 
differ on how much to spend, what kind of taxes to 
increase or cut, and how actively the government 
should intervene in the economy. As a result, dis-
putes about macroeconomic policy quickly turn 
into political conflicts. President George W. Bush, a 
Republican who took office in 2001, was repeat-
edly attacked by congressional Democrats for run-
ning big budget deficits. Then, after President 
Barack Obama took office in 2009, Republicans at-
tacked the Obama administration for running a big 
budget deficit.
	
This chapter, however, will examine a relatively 
noncontroversial topic: the basic measure of the size 
of the economy, which is the gross domestic product, 
or GDP for short. We mentioned GDP in Chapter 1, 
but we will look at it more closely now. GDP is the 
starting point for all macroeconomics—and for any 
discussion of the overall economy. We will discuss 
the different components of GDP and will finish by 
comparing the size of the U.S. economy with the 
economies of other countries.
MEASURING THE ECONOMY  LO7-1 
When you visit a hospital or a doctor’s office, a nurse gener-
ally takes your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature; 
weighs you; and perhaps draws blood samples. These mea-
surements have three purposes. First, if anything has 
changed since your last visit, that could indicate a problem. 
Second, if you have a complaint, the measurements help pin-
point the cause. Finally, the information helps 
guide your treatment.
Measuring the economy has the same pur-
poses: to identify economic problems, diagnose 
their causes, and figure out the right policy 
fixes. But taking the temperature of an econ-
omy as big as that of the United States is not an 
easy job. In fact, before the mid-1930s, econo-
mists had no systematic way of measuring or 
tracking the economy as a whole. Government 
statisticians and industry trade associations 
could provide some information, such as the 
LO7-1

domestic product 
(GDP), and distin-
guish between  
final goods and 
services and inter-
mediate inputs.

• Change in private inventories: 
goods produced by businesses that 
are not immediately purchased.
• Government consumption and in-
vestment: goods and services pur-
chased by the government.
• Net exports: the difference be-
tween exports and imports.
Each of these amounts is measured in 
dollars, and gross domestic product 
consists of the sum of all of these:
GDP (in dollars) = Personal 
consumption + Nonresidential 
investment + Residential 
investment + Change in private 
inventories + Government 
consumption and investment + 
Net exports
Table 7.1 shows how the different com-
ponents of GDP added up in 2015. For 
example, residential investment totaled 
$610 billion. Note that net exports were 
negative because the United States im-
ported more than it exported (we’ll dis-
cuss imports and exports later in the 
chapter).
No Double-Counting
We’ve listed the main components of 
GDP, but we seem to have left out some 
economic activity. For example, no cat-
egory of GDP corresponds to, say, the 
spending by a business on janitorial ser-
vices or electricity. In fact, all the inter-
mediate inputs of businesses (described 
in Chapter 4) appear to be left out.
	
There’s a reason for that. To elimi-
nate double-counting, BEA statisticians 
count only the purchases of final goods 
and services—that is, goods and ser-
vices that are bought by their ultimate 
users. Purchases of intermediate inputs 
are left out of GDP. Intermediate 
­inputs include any goods and services 
bought by a business that are com-
pletely used up in production in less 
than a year.
Why do statisticians leave out inter-
mediate inputs? Think about a restau-
rant that buys apples to make apple pie, 
­economic statistics, such as unemployment, inflation, 
productivity, and foreign trade.
The Basics of Gross Domestic Product
The BEA is charged with estimating output of the U.S. econ-
omy. The gross domestic product or GDP is the dollar 
value of the total output of the economy in a year. Collec-
tively, all the statistics that feed into this process of estimat-
ing GDP are known as the system of national accounts. 
(The BEA also estimates quarterly GDP, which is economic 
output in each quarter of the year.)
Measuring the output of the largest economy in the 
world is a complicated task. GDP includes a wide range of 
goods and services—we’ll explain next which ones belong 
and which ones don’t. For now, think of that range as a 
long list going from automobiles and light trucks (17.4 mil-
lion sold in 2015) to baseball games (74 million fans 
­attending in 2015), to college classes (an estimated 19 mil-
lion students enrolled in higher education), to military 
strategy (896 generals and admirals in the U.S. armed 
forces as of the end of 2015), to haircuts (59,000 barbers 
and 597,000 hairdressers, hairstylists, and cosmetologists 
hard at work cutting hair in 2014), to paintball (an esti-
mated 3.4 million people participated in 2014). No one re-
ally knows just how many different items this list contains, 
but it’s certainly well into the millions for the United 
States, depending on how finely we cut it.
Such a list, even if we could compile it, would be interest-
ing but not terribly useful. The different types of goods and 
services are all measured in different units. What have auto-
mobiles to do with admirals besides beginning with the 
same letter? Not much. And there’s no easy way to add them 
all up.
But here’s the key: If we can express each item on the 
output list as a dollar amount, the statisticians at the BEA 
can sum them into a figure for the total production of the 
economy. For example, in 2015 U.S. households spent 
$39 billion on veterinary and other services for pets. We 
can add that to the billions spent for haircuts, the total 
amount spent on knee replacements, and the revenues col-
lected by zoos and aquariums. After we have added our 
entire list of products and services, we have the output of 
the economy!
The Components of GDP
What goes into GDP? Here are its components:
• Personal consumption: goods and services for household 
use.
• Nonresidential investment: the long-lived buildings, 
equipment, and software that businesses purchase to use 
in production.
• Residential investment: the construction of new homes 
and the renovation of existing homes.

CH 07 
The First Step into Macroeconomics
However, a business can make some purchases that are 
included as part of GDP, like nonresidential investments in 
buildings, equipment, and software. What makes these dif-
ferent is that they are long-lived—that is, they don’t get 
used up within a year. When the printing company buys 
a  printing press—which may have a useful lifetime of 
10 years—that’s counted as a nonresidential investment. 
Similarly, the purchase of a commercial oven by the restau-
rant to bake the apple pies is a nonresidential investment 
and is included in GDP.
UNDERSTANDING GDP  LO7-2 
Let’s take a closer look at each component of GDP in more 
detail.
Personal Consumption
The biggest category of GDP is personal consumption, 
which accounted for $12.3 trillion in 2015. This enormous 
sum includes all sorts of goods that households spend money 
on, such as food, telephone services, personal computers, 
automobiles, and gasoline.
The category of personal consumption also includes the 
money consumers spent on pet food and on greeting cards. 
So when you buy holiday cards, you are contributing toward 
personal consumption and GDP. Religious intangibles—
contributions to your local church, synagogue, or mosque—
are counted as part of personal consumption. So are spending 
which it then serves to customers. The apples are an inter-
mediate input, and the apple pie is part of personal con-
sumption expenditures. We don’t want GDP to include both 
the apples and the apple pie because that would count the 
apples twice. Similarly, a printing company uses paper and 
ink to produce a book for sale to readers—say, a textbook. 
To avoid double-counting, only the purchase price of the 
book is counted as part of GDP.
Total GDP of the United States in 2015 was roughly 
$17.9 trillion. None of us sees a trillion of anything in 
our daily lives, so it’s hard to get our arms around a 
number that big. Let’s figure out how big it really is.
	
The thickness of a $1 bill is roughly .0043 inch. If we 
piled up 17.9 trillion dollar bills, they would make a pile 
more than a million miles high. That’s four times the dis-
tance to the moon.
	
By contrast, if you make $50,000 per year, those 
dollars bills piled up would be 18 feet high−not nearly 
as impressive.

­computers on workers’ desktops, office chairs, 
factory machinery, ­office buildings, power 
plants, wires to power plants, hospitals, medi-
cal equipment, and airplanes—anything that is 
used in production and that lasts for more than 
one year.
The pattern of nonresidential investment has 
changed over time. In the 1950s and the 1960s, 
U.S. businesses put their money mostly into industrial and 
transportation equipment. Manufacturers were building and 
expanding factories, making everything from steel and cars 
to clothing and toys; as a result, they needed heavy machin-
ery. At the same time, transportation companies were buying 
truck fleets to carry the raw materials to the factories and 
then shipping the finished goods customers across the 
country.
The pattern of nonresidential investment has changed over 
time, reflecting the shift to a more global and information-
based economy. Now many factories that feed U.S. stores 
on education and contributions or bequests to 
universities. Gambling losses count as personal 
consumption, too, as does the latest mobile 
game app.
One oddity of GDP statistics is that medical 
spending counts as part of personal consump-
tion even if a health insurer or the federal Medi-
care system pays the bill. The reason is that the 
individual is the ultimate consumer of medical spending. If 
Medicare pays for your grandfather’s heart surgery, that 
counts as personal consumption for him even though the 
money never touched his hands.
Nonresidential Investment
Another important GDP spending category is nonresiden-
tial investment. That’s the total of outlays by businesses on 
the structures, equipment, and software they need to run 
their operations. Nonresidential investment includes

the components  
of GDP.
SPOTLIGHT: CONSPICUOUS SPENDING
When the BEA totals up spending on personal consump-
tion or residential investment, it makes no judgment 
about an item’s usefulness or social value. For example, 
in 2015 the residential investment component of GDP 
included initial construction costs for an enormous man-
sion being built in the ritzy Bel Air section of Los Ange-
les. The home will include more than 100,00 square 
feet, including a 30-car garage and four swimming 
pools. 
	
Meanwhile, the personal consumption component of 
GDP includes spending on flashy jewelry, plastic surgery, 
expensive parties, and all the champagne that profes-
sional athletes pour on each other when they win the 
championship. If you can spend it, the BEA can count it.

Economic Milestone
AUTO’S SHARE OF 
SPENDING HITS PEAK
1950
Following World War II, factories switched from making tanks and planes to 
producing cars—lots of them. In 1950, spending on motor vehicles and parts 
exceeded 7 percent of personal consumption, an all-time record, as Americans 
started new households, moved out to the suburbs and adopted a car-oriented 
lifestyle. Today, we are still driving, but spending on motor vehicles and parts has 
gone down to less than 4 percent of personal consumption. Instead, Americans 
have boosted their spending on items such as medical care, while adding new 
products such as personal computers. The car is no longer king.

are in China. As a result, U.S. companies have much less 
need to invest in industrial equipment at home.
Instead, the biggest category of business investment 
spending today is software, which counts as investment 
even though it is usually not a physical product. The next 
biggest category is trucks, ­followed by communications 
equipment and computers. Altogether, information technol-
ogy spending—computers, communications equipment, and 
software—accounted for roughly 28 percent of nonresiden-
tial investment spending in 2015, up from  6 percent in 1950 
(Figure 7.1).
Keep in mind a couple of important points. First, business 
investment counts toward U.S. GDP only if it happens in this 
country. So when a United States–based company like Intel 
spends billions to build a factory in Ireland, that does not 
count toward U.S. GDP. In contrast, when a ­foreign-based 
company such as Toyota lays out billions to build factories in 
Kentucky and ­Indiana, that does count toward ­nonresidential 
investment and GDP. ­Location—not ownership—matters for 
the calculation of GDP.
The other point is that most outlays by businesses are 
for intermediate inputs, so they don’t count as part of non-
residential investment. When Walmart buys socks and 
sells them to consumers, the socks count as personal con-
sumption. Only when Walmart builds a new supercenter 
are its construction expenses part of nonresidential invest-
ment. Similarly, purchases of food by restaurants are not 
counted in GDP, but the meals bought by diners count as 
personal consumption.
Residential Investment
Spending on the building of new homes and the renovation 
of existing ones is called residential investment. If you just 
rebuilt your kitchen for $50,000, that’s part of residential in-
vestment. The construction of that eyesore of a home down 
the street also counts as residential investment. However, if 
you buy an existing home for $500,000, that does not count 
as residential investment because no actual production or 
construction occurred—the house was already there. Re-
member, GDP calculates production of new goods and 
services.
Residential investment is highly volatile, which means it 
can quickly swing from high to low. Take a look at Fig-
ure 7.2, which measures residential investment as a share of 
GDP. Residential investment was very strong in the early 
1950s, when builders put up millions of homes for the 
­generation of families formed after World War II, creating 
whole new suburbs across most of the country.  Then resi-
dential investment gradually slowed, hitting a trough in the 
recession of 1981–1982, when mortgage interest rates 
jumped so high that no one could afford to build or buy a 
home. Then we see on the chart the housing boom years of 
the mid-2000s, followed by a deep bust and a slow 
recovery.

benefits. Government social benefits in-
clude Medicare, Social Security, unem-
ployment insurance, education grants, 
veteran benefits, food stamps, welfare 
payments, and housing subsidies.
Government social benefits are typi-
cally used to fund personal consumption 
by individuals, or perhaps residential 
­investment. Veteran benefits, Social 
­Security and unemployment insurance 
provide cash that can be used for food, 
televisions or to pay for rent or even 
home renovations. Medicare and food 
stamps are used to fund particular types 
of consumption.
The other big category of govern-
ment spending is called government consumption and in-
vestment, which includes all government purchases of goods 
and services, such as salaries paid to government employees. 
These goods and services are also called the output of 
­government. In 2015, government consumption and invest-
ment totaled $3183 billion, as shown in Table 7.1.
Government consumption includes all the salaries paid 
to government workers, such as teachers, police, military 
personnel, U.S. senators, and the president. It also counts all 
purchases by the government for immediate use, including 
food for government cafeterias, pencils for government 
­offices, and fuel for nuclear submarines.
Government investment, on the other hand, reports all 
purchases of long-lived assets such as tanks and planes, gov-
ernment buildings, and software. It also includes money the 
government spends on building and maintaining highways 
and airports. The purchase of a new fire truck is investment 
by your local government, but the salaries paid to firefight-
ers are government consumption.
Government Consumption and Investment
Now we come to government. Clearly the federal, state, and 
local governments in the United States are an important part 
of the economy, spending a total of $6 trillion in 2015. A bit 
less than half that sum is paid out directly to individuals in the 
form of transfer payments, also known as government social

The output of government is thus equal to government 
consumption plus government investment. One major output 
of government is spending on national defense. Fig-
ure 7.3 shows how government’s outlays for defense goods 
and services, nondefense goods and services, and govern-
ment social benefits have changed over time. Since the 
1950s peak of the ­Korean War, defense spending has 
dropped as a share of GDP. Nondefense government spend-
ing on goods and services, measured as a share of GDP, has 
been more or less flat since the mid-1970s. Government so-
cial benefits—propelled mainly by Social Security and gov-
ernment health care spending—have steadily risen as a share 
of the economy.
Change in Private Inventories
The change in private inventories is a small but important 
component of GDP. This ­category represents the increase or 
decrease of inventories held by manufacturers, wholesalers, 
and retailers. Goods that are produced but are not immedi-
ately sold—like cars—go into inventories. When companies 
add to their inventories, this change contributes positively to 
GDP because the goods count as production even if no one 
has bought them yet. When companies draw down their in-
ventories by selling goods, the change in this category is 
subtracted from GDP.
Inadequate inventory management used to play a sig-
nificant role in making economic downturns worse. Before 
the information revolution, companies had a hard time

SPOTLIGHT: A DAY IN  
THE LIFE OF GDP
As you move through your day, almost everything you 
do is counted in GDP in one way or another. Consider 
the Bedell family in Catonsville, Maryland, a suburb of 
Baltimore. When we looked in on them in 2008, the 
family had three boys and two girls, ages 2 to 15. Most 
mornings, the kids ate cereal for breakfast (that counts 
as personal consumption). Then two of the children 
were picked up by school buses (the buses, owned 
and operated by a private company, were counted as 
nonresidential investment when they were purchased). 
The salaries of their teachers, of course, counted as 
government consumption.
	
Both parents, John and Lisa, worked. Lisa was a 
nurse at a private nonprofit hospital in Baltimore. All the 
hospital equipment counted as nonresidential invest-
ment when it was purchased.
	
When the Bedell children came home, they often 
played video games (personal consumption) in the 
basement, which was just refinished in 2007 (the cost 
of the renovation counted as residential investment). 
And most components of the video game ­console were 
made overseas, so they counted as imports.

one country—in this case, the United States—and sold out-
side that country, so they count as part of gross domestic 
product. If a company builds a tractor in the United States for 
sale overseas, that’s part of gross domestic product.
In contrast, imports, which are goods and services 
produced outside a country and consumed within that 
country, are considered in the GDP calculation with a 
negative sign. If you buy a toy from China that was im-
ported into the United States for $5, that’s $5 of personal 
consumption spending that wasn’t for goods or services 
produced at home.
In 2015, the United States imported about 
$2782 billion of goods and services, and ex-
ported $2253 billion of goods and services. Be-
cause imports today exceed exports, net exports 
are negative (–$529 billion). Let’s stop here for 
a moment. The fact that net exports are nega-
tive doesn’t mean that global trade is bad for 
the United States. As we will see in Chapter 14, the United 
States benefits in many different ways from trade, including 
lower prices and faster innovation.
However, the fact that net exports are negative means that 
the United States is consuming more than it produces. Gross 
domestic purchases indicate the amount spent within the 
United States on final goods and services by consumers, busi-
nesses, and government. That is, it represents the spending ac-
tivity of the whole country. In comparison, GDP is the amount 
of final goods and services produced in 
the United States. When gross domestic 
purchases are greater than gross domes-
tic product, as is the case now, that means 
net exports are negative.
WHAT GDP DOES NOT  
INCLUDE  LO7-3 
GDP focuses primarily on the market 
economy—the part of the economy in 
which people get paid for the work they 
do. However, it does not cover the 
­nonmarket economy, in which people 
may work just as hard but not get paid. 
For example, a stay-at-home parent is 
not given credit in the national income 
accounts for all the time and effort that 
go into raising children, cleaning 
house, and cooking food. That nonmar-
ket labor disappears completely from 
GDP as if children magically raise 
themselves and homes stay clean with-
out effort. All the hard work put in by 
volunteers at hospitals, schools, and 
­religious organizations is not counted 
as part of GDP either.
tracking sales and inventories in real time. In fact, it was a 
ritual for many manufacturers and retailers to physically 
count their inventory once a year. The problem was that 
when the economy slowed, inventories would build up un-
recognized. And when manufacturers finally realized their 
mistakes, they would need to work off these inventories by 
cutting back production and laying off factory workers.
But today, information technology lets companies keep 
much better track of their inventories. In addition, many firms 
now manufacture cars, computers, or other products only 
when they actually have customer orders in hand and thus 
build up little or no unsold inventory. What’s 
more, many goods consumed in the United 
States are now imported. As a result, when sales 
slow, inventories build up in foreign factories, 
where they do not count as part of U.S. GDP. As 
a result, inventory swings have become less im-
portant to the overall U.S. economy.
Net Exports
In this era of globalization, foreign trade is more important 
than ever. One measure of the contribution of the global econ-
omy to GDP is measured by net exports, which equal exports 
minus imports. Exports are goods and services produced in

The goods and ser-
vices produced in a

Successful United States–based companies such as 
­Apple, Google, Pfizer, IBM, Boeing, Intel, and GE have 
become increasingly global in recent years. For example, 
in 2015 aircraft maker Boeing got 59 percent of its reve-
nue from customers located outside of the United States.
	
The planes that Boeing sells are assembled in the 
United States and exported to other countries. How-
ever, Boeing uses a global ­supply chain, so parts for  
its planes come from many different countries. For 
­example, the 787 Dreamliner included major parts from 
­Japan, Italy, England, France, and Sweden. That’s not 
unusual. Many products that are exported from the 
United States contain parts that were originally made  
in other regions of the world.
	
Similarly, a product imported into the United States 
may contain parts from multiple countries. One famous 
study took apart the Apple iPhone 4, assembled in 
China, and found that it contained components from 
­Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Europe, and the United States. 
The interconnection of the global economy is a reality.

nanny to watch the children, those child care activities move 
from the unpaid to the paid sector and now show up on the 
GDP ledger.
One final note: GDP also does not measure the under-
ground economy, the portion of the economy that does not 
pay taxes or otherwise get reported to the government. That 
includes illegal activities such as drug dealing and off-the-
book transactions such as the babysitter or the landscaper 
who gets paid in cash and does not report it to the Internal 
Revenue Service. Estimates vary widely, but the size of the 
underground economy in the United States could be as large 
as 10 percent of GDP.
INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS 
OF GDP  LO7-4 
So far we’ve been looking at the gross domestic product of 
the United States, which has the largest economy in the 
world. Other countries calculate their own GDP using 
roughly the same rules and principles. That allows us to see 
how the U.S. economy stacks up against the production of 
other countries.
An international comparison of GDP tells us which coun-
tries have the most production. It can also indicate which 
The annual time use study by the 
­Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that 
on average, U.S. adults spent 2.8 hours 
per day on unpaid work in 2014. That 
includes housework, child care, and 
­volunteering. By comparison, Americans 
devote an average of 3.25 hours per day 
to paid work. (The reason that number 
seems low is that it includes weekends and the time of people 
who don’t hold paid jobs, such as stay-at-home parents and 
the retired.)
If we counted those hours of unpaid work in GDP, how 
much would they be worth? Let’s suppose we compen-
sated all the unpaid hours at the low figure of $7 per hour. 
Then unpaid work would be worth roughly $20 a day 
($7.00 times 2.8  hours). With 365 days in a year, that 
means the unpaid work is worth about $7,200 per person, 
or about $1.8 trillion for the 250 million people in the 
United States who are 16 and older.
The omission of unpaid work from GDP creates some 
odd situations. For example, if a hospital moves an unpaid 
volunteer worker onto the payroll, GDP goes up even if the 
person is doing ­exactly the same amount of work as before. 
Similarly, if a mother who has been staying home to take 
care of her children takes a job outside the home and hires a

countries have the highest living standards. 
And of course we can still fulfill one of the 
original purposes of gross domestic product, 
which is to calculate military capabilities 
(countries with higher GDP can generally pro-
duce more military ships, planes, and other 
equipment). Today, the largest economy in the 
world still belongs to the United States, 
­followed by China, Japan, and Germany. 
GDP per Capita
GDP tells you how big an economy is—that is, how much it 
can produce. However, if we want to know which countries 
have higher living standards and which have lower, we need 
to look at population too. India, for example, has a bigger 
gross domestic product than does Sweden, but India also has 
many more people.
The key concept here is GDP per capita, or GDP per 
person. GDP per capita is the economic output of a country 
divided by the size of its population. In other words, GDP 
per capita measures the amount of output each person would 
get if the economic pie were sliced evenly.
Figure 7.4 shows the GDP per capita for selected coun-
tries, adjusting for different price levels in different coun-
tries. At the top are Norway, Switzerland, the United States, 
and Sweden. Other industrialized countries such as 
­Germany, Canada, France, the United King-
dom, Japan, and Korea trail somewhat behind, 
followed by middle-income countries such as 
Russia, Mexico, Brazil, and China. Bringing 
up the rear are poor countries such as Bangla-
desh and Ethiopia.
These numbers should be viewed a bit 
skeptically because it’s hard to make eco-
nomic comparisons across countries. What is true, though, 
is that looking at GDP per capita tells us that much of the 
world still has a long way to go before reaching the living 
standards of the United States and the big European 
countries.
CONCLUSION
Measuring the size of the economy is the essential first 
step in macroeconomics. The key measure is gross domes-
tic product (GDP), which enables us to put a dollar value 
on the output of the economy. We can 
also use GDP to compare different 
economies.
However, GDP is just a snapshot at a 
moment in time. In the next two chap-
ters, we will go further and look at how 
the economy changes over time.

SUMMARY
	 1.	The Great Depression and World War II forced econo-
mists to invent new tools for measuring an economy. 
They came up with gross domestic product (GDP), 
which is the dollar value of the output of an economy. 
Gross domestic product counts only purchases of final 
goods and services, not purchases of intermediate 
­inputs. (LO7-1)
	 2.	Gross domestic product includes personal consump-
tion, nonresidential investment, residential investment, 
government consumption and investment, inventory 
investment, and net exports. (LO7-2)
	 3.	GDP does not include the nonmarket economy, such 
as the work done by stay-at-home parents and volun-
teers. It also does not include the underground econ-
omy of illegal and off-the-book activities. (LO7-3)
	 4.	GDP and GDP per capita allow economists to com-
pare living standards across countries. (LO7-4)

After reading this chapter, you should be able to:
LO8-1	
Define inflation, and calculate the 
inflation rate using the consumer 
price index (CPI).

Explain the difference between 
relative price shifts and the overall

run the central banks of each country—is 
to keep inflation under control.
	
In this chapter, we take the next big 
step into macroeconomics by defining the 
idea of an average price level for a whole 
economy. We’ll explain how we can use 
this average price level to calculate the 
­inflation rate. We’ll also compare a rise in 
the overall price level and a shift in rela-
tive prices, and show how inflation is 
­adjusted for changes in quality. We’ll look 
at the difference between expected and 
unexpected inflation and identify who 
gets helped or hurt by each. Finally, we’ll 
end with a discussion of falling prices, 
which is known as deflation.
E
verything has a price—that is, every-
thing that is bought and sold in a mar-
ket economy. In the United States, there 
are billions of different prices. Some busi-
nesses, like airlines, change their prices 
every day, raising ticket prices on some 
routes and lowering them on others. Other 
businesses operate for years without 
changing their prices. Electronics stores 
always seem to be cutting their prices on 
computers, whereas colleges always 
seem to be raising tuition. However, in 
2015 college tuition and fees rose by only 
3.5 percent, the smallest increase in at 
least 35 years. 
	
To get a clearer picture of what’s hap-
pening to prices in the economy as a 
whole, we need to be able to average 
those billions of prices together. We want 
to know whether the overall level of prices 
is falling or rising, and how fast.
	
That rise in overall prices—also known 
as inflation—is a key measure of the 
health of an economy. If prices are rising 
too fast (rapid price declines do happen, 
though rarely), that’s bad news for con-
sumers and businesses. In fact, a main 
goal of economic policymakers around 
the world—particularly the people who

THE BASICS OF INFLATION  LO8-1 
Suppose you were walking down the street, and every 10 
feet a thief stole a nickel or a dime out of your pocket. The 
first few times it might be funny, but then you would start 
getting annoyed. After a while you’d realize that the steady 
theft of nickels and dimes was really making 
you poorer.
That, in a nutshell, is how inflation works. As 
prices rise, it’s as if the money in your pocket 
were shrinking and ­becoming capable of buying 
less. Over the past 40 years, the overall price 
level in the United States has more than quadru-
pled. That means $25,000 
in 1975 had the buying 
power of $110,000 today. 
It’s as if each dollar today has become 
less valuable and is worth less than a 
quarter of what it was worth 40 years 
ago. Or to put it a different way, if your 
parents earned $25,000 in 1975, and you 
are earning $110,000 today, you are not 
doing any better than they were.
The Average Price Level
At any moment in time, consumers 
will see the prices of some goods and 
services rising while other items are becoming cheaper. In 
October 2015, for instance, the prices of clothing, new cars, 
and oil all fell. In the same month, the prices of food, rent, 
transportation, and medical care, among other things, rose. 
In other words, that month was good for someone who was 
buying a new shirt and bad for someone who had to shell out 
bucks to cover a medical expense.
When we talk about inflation, though, we’re 
concerned with what is happening to prices 
across the entire economy, not to any particular 
item or even category of items. The average 
level of prices in the economy measures how 
much it costs to buy a market basket of com-
mon goods and services. The U.S. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics (BLS) picks the contents of the 
market basket to represent the pattern of expen-
ditures by a typical U.S. household and gives each item a 
certain weight to represent its relative importance in the 
typical budget (see Table 8.1).
The single biggest part of the market basket is “owners’ 
equivalent rent of primary residence,” which is a measure of 
the cost of owning your home. (see “How It Works: Measuring 
the Price of Housing”). The second largest part of the mar-
ket basket is food consumed at home, followed by medical 
care. Some items that get the most attention in the media, 
such as gasoline, account for only a small portion of the 
market basket.

much it costs to pur-
chase a market basket

Any particular person or household 
may have a pattern of expenditures dif-
ferent from the market basket. For ex-
ample, if you are young, you will tend 
to spend more on education and less on 
health care than an elderly household. 
But the basket is reasonably representa-
tive of the typical expenditures of an 
average U.S household.
To make comparisons between years 
easier, the BLS has chosen 100 to repre-
sent the average 1982–1984 price level, 
and it now measures all other years rela-
tive to this base year. This measurement 
gives us the consumer price ­index or 
CPI, which tracks the average price level in the United States. 
For example, the CPI in 1985 was 107.6. That means the 
average price level in 1992 was 7.6 percent above the average 
price level in 1982–1984. In Figure 8.1, we can see the con-
sumer price index for the United States from 1950 to 2015.
For another example, we will look at two years. The CPI 
was 107.6 in 1985 and 237.0 in 2015 (both are marked in the 
figure). That means the average price level rose about 2.2 
times between 1985 and 2015 because 237.0 divided by 
107.6 is roughly about 2.2. This in turn means $2,200 today 
has roughly the buying power of $1,000 in 1985.
The Inflation Rate
We formally define inflation as a sustained upward move-
ment in the average level of prices. The inflation rate is the 
annual percentage change in the average price level, or a

We all know what the price of a home means. Then why 
does the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measure the 
price of housing with the complicated phrase “owners’ 
equivalent rent of primary residence”?
	
What the BLS is trying to measure is the price of  
a year’s worth of housing services, rather than the 
price of owning the whole home forever. So rather 
than looking at the sale prices of homes, the BLS 
­statisticians look at the price of renting similar homes 
for a year. They use that rental price as the “owners’ 
equivalent rent of primary residence.” The rent paid 
for a home is a pure measure of how much people 
are willing to pay, per month or year, for the privilege 
of living in that home for that period.
	
Usually the owners’ equivalent rent is less volatile 
than home prices. For example, home prices soared 
by 80 percent between 2000 and 2006, but the 
­owners’ equivalent rent went up by only 20 percent. 
Then during the Great Recession, housing prices 
plunged by 30 percent between 2006 and 2010. 
However, the owners’ equivalent rent actually rose 
by 8 percent because rents on comparable homes 
continued to rise.

Inflation
measure of how much the average price level changes over a 
year. Because the CPI tracks the average price level, the in-
flation rate is also the annual percentage change in the CPI. 
For example, the inflation rate for 2015 is the percentage 
change in the CPI from 2014 to 2015. 
As Figure 8.2 shows, the annual inflation rate was low 
through most of the 1960s. In 1962, for example, the infla-
tion rate was 1 percent, equivalent to the price of a $1.00 
soft drink today going up by a penny in one year. On the 
other hand, the figure shows that inflation skyrocketed in the 
late 1970s and early 1980s, hitting 13.5 percent in 1980. In 
fact, inflation was generally identified as the biggest eco-
nomic problem in those years. (Later in this chapter, we’ll 
explain why high inflation is so disturbing.)
Since 1990, the annual inflation rate has remained under 
4 percent. In 2009, the annual inflation rate was actually 
negative: the CPI fell from 215.3 in 2008 to 214.5 in 2009. 
(See “How It Works: Calculating Percentage Change.”) In 
2015, the inflation rate was only 0.1 percent.
The CPI and the consumer inflation rate are published 
each month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which surveys 
23,000 retail establishments and 50,000 households to up-
date the prices in its market basket. The BLS then calculates 
how much the average price level changed that month. The 
BLS also calculates how much the av-
erage price level changed over the past 
year. For example, in October 2015, the 
CPI increased by 0.2 percent. In the 
previous 12 months, prices had risen by 
0.2 percent as well.
A related measure, also published 
by the BLS, is core inflation. That’s

Economics is concerned, in part, with how rapidly the 
economy changes over time. For example, the inflation 
rate indicates how fast the price level is rising. And in 
the next chapter, we’ll see that the growth rate indi-
cates how fast the economy is expanding.
	
In both cases, we measure the speed of change as 
an annual percentage change. A 1 percent inflation 
rate, for example, is a relatively small rise in the price 
level, whereas a 20 percent rise would be quite large.
	
Here’s the formula for calculating percentage 
change when we know the original level of a measure, 
such as prices, and a new level measured later:
Percentage change = [(New number – Original number)/ 
Original number] × 100
	
Suppose, for instance, that the price of dinner for 
two at your favorite restaurant goes from $50 to $55. 
How big a percentage change is that? The percentage 
change from the original level of 50 to the new level 
of 55 is
[(55 − 50)/50] × 100 = [5/50] × 100 = 0.1 × 100 = 10%
	
Notice that multiplying by 100 in the last step simply 
converts the answer to a percentage.
HOW IT WORKS: 
CALCULATING  
PERCENTAGE CHANGE
CORE INFLATION
A measure of con-
sumer inflation that 
omits the changes  
in food and energy 
prices.

the consumer inflation rate without taking food and en-
ergy into account. Why would we want to leave out food 
and energy? One reason is that those two categories hap-
pen to be volatile, sometimes spiking and then coming 
back down again. For example, if there’s a frost in Florida, 
the prices of vegetables and fruit can jump and push up 
the overall inflation rate. But when the next growing 
­season starts, those prices drop. Similarly, we’ve seen 
large fluctuations in energy prices that quickly reversed 
themselves.
These big movements in food and energy prices can 
sometimes obscure what’s happening to inflation in other 
goods and services. For example, from October 2014 to 
­October 2015, the overall inflation rate was 0.2 percent, but 
the core rate was 1.9 percent. 
Which number matters more? If we expect food and en-
ergy prices to come back down to “normal,” then we should 
keep an eye on the core inflation rate. But if we expect food 
and energy prices to stay low, then the overall inflation rate 
is the one to watch.
RELATIVE PRICE SHIFTS  LO8-2 
The inflation figures that get the most attention each month 
are the overall inflation rate and the core inflation rate. The 
Bureau of Labor Statistics also reports the inflation rate for 
subcategories of goods and services, narrowing the figures 
down to such individual fruits as apples, bananas, and 
­oranges (including tangerines). Funeral expenses get their 
own price index, as do college textbooks, food from vending 
machines and mobile vendors, and “beer and other malt 
­beverages away from home.”
A relative price shift happens when the inflation rate 
of a good or service is significantly higher or lower than 
the overall inflation rate. If it’s higher, then that good or 
service is getting more expensive over time 
relative to other possible purchases. If the in-
flation rate of a good or service is lower than 
the overall inflation rate, it’s getting relatively 
cheaper.
If we look at the long-term inflation statistics 
in Table 8.2, we can see some large relative 
price shifts in items important to college stu-
dents. The annual inflation rate for all items av-
eraged 2.2 percent in the 15 years between 
2000 and 2015. But the prices of goods such as 
apparel, toys, televisions, sports equipment, and automotive 
vehicles actually dropped over the same period. These goods 
have become relatively cheaper.
What other items have become relatively cheaper? The 
biggest declines have come in the technology area (not sur-
prisingly), where televisions, wireless telephone services, 
personal computers, and related items have dropped dramat-
ically in price. 
In contrast, the relative prices of many services have risen 
as well; their inflation rates have been significantly higher 
than overall inflation. For example, looking at 
Table 8.2, we see that admissions to sporting 
events rose at a 4.2 percent annual rate be-
tween 2000 and 2010—far faster than the 
overall inflation rate and probably due to the 
soaring pay of athletes. Other services with 
fast-rising prices ­included medical care and 
college tuition. (For an example of a recent 
relative price shift, see “Spotlight: The Price 
of Air Travel.”)
Globalization and Inflation
One key reason some goods have be-
come relatively cheaper is globaliza-
tion. The production of many goods 
has shifted from the United States and 
the developed countries of Europe to 
lower-cost developing countries such

This table shows some goods and services where prices 
have been rising much faster than the overall rate of infla-
tion, and some for which prices have been rising much 
more slowly or even falling.

as China. That’s certainly kept down prices for things like 
clothing and consumer electronics, which are mostly 
imported.
In contrast, it is much harder to shift the production of 
services overseas. When you get your hair cut, the person 
holding the scissors generally has to be at the same loca-
tion as you. As a result, it is difficult to import haircuts. 
Medical care, too, has proven tough to outsource because 
much of it, from surgery to nursing to physical rehabilita-
tion, has to be delivered in person.
But gradually companies are figur-
ing out how to “offshore” parts of ser-
vice industries. In theory, for example, 
you could do your homework assign-
ments online and they could be graded 
by someone in India or the Philippines. 
Your X-rays can be read by technicians 
overseas, though that is still not com-
mon. As events like these become fea-
sible, the trend for goods to become 
cheaper relative to services could slow 
down—or even reverse if the prices of 
services were to fall low enough.
Quality Improvements and Inflation
When is a price increase not really a price increase? The in-
flation rate is supposed to measure price changes of a fixed 
market basket of goods and services. But in the real world, 
products are always changing. Companies introduce new 
products and improve their old ones.
Sometimes, the price of a good or service rises because 
of an improvement in quality, which is a change in the na-
ture of a good or service that increases its value for buyers. 
In that case, we don’t count that price increase as part of the 
inflation rate. Suppose a car manufacturer decides to install 
antilock braking as a standard feature in all its cars and raises 
prices by $100 at the same time. According to BLS statisti-
cians, that price increase should not enter into the calcula-
tion of inflation because it represents a quality improvement 
and not merely a price change.
When the quality or features of a product change slowly 
over time, it’s relatively easy for the BLS to get a sense of 
how much of a price increase is related to changes in the 
product and how much represents a pure price change. A 
pure price change is simply a change in price without any 
change in the quality or nature of a product.
However, in areas of the economy where rapid techno-
logical change is taking place, an existing product or ser-
vice can be replaced by one that’s different and hard to 
compare to the original. For example, each generation of 
personal computers is faster than the one before. That 
makes the job of measuring inflation more difficult because 
even when the price seems to stay the same, the actual 
power of the computer is increasing, which makes computer 
power cheaper over time.
The same is true of consumer electronics. Consider, for 
example, the Sony Walkman, which was an enormous hit 
when it was introduced in 1979. It retailed for about $200 and 
held one audiocassette’s worth of music, or roughly 15 songs. 
For the first time, people could bring their music with them.
Compare that to the first iPod, which sold for $399 but 
held about 1,000 songs when Apple introduced it in 2001. If 
we are calculating the inflation rate for consumer electron-
ics, should the difference between the Walkman and the 
iPod be counted as a price increase or a price decrease? The 
first iPod cost a lot more than the first Walkman; but the 
iPod had a much lower price per song (roughly 20 cents 
compared to about $1.30 for the Walkman).
Economic Milestone
THE GREAT 
COFFEE CRUNCH
1994
Coffee drinkers were hit by a very large relative price shift in 1994 because of a 
spate of natural disasters in coffee-growing countries that made coffee beans 
scarce: insects in Colombia, frost in Brazil, civil war in Rwanda. A pound of ground 
roast coffee rose from $2.50 in January of that year to $4.50 by August—a much 
bigger rise than the overall price level.
SPOTLIGHT: THE PRICE  
OF AIR TRAVEL
Air travel has become more popular in recent years. 
Planes are packed full, and delays are common 
­because airports are so congested.
	
But have airplane tickets become cheaper or more 
expensive? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
the average price of plane tickets rose by 22 percent 
between 2000 and 2015. However, over the same 
­period, the overall price index rose by 38 percent. In 
other words, air travel became a lot cheaper during that 
stretch compared with other goods and services. That 
helps explain why the number of air passengers in-
creased over the period.

The price comparison between the Walkman and the iPod 
is difficult enough, but at least they perform the same func-
tion: playing music on a portable device. Measuring infla-
tion is even harder when technological change is 
disruptive—that is, when it enables us to do things that 
weren’t realistically possible before, like having a GPS sys-
tem in a car or taking a college course online.
ADJUSTING FOR INFLATION  LO8-3 
In 1979, the typical U.S. household had an income of about 
$16,461. As of 2014, the typical household had an income 
of about $53,657 (where typical is defined as the median 
household, so half of U.S. households receive less than this 
household and half receive more). At first glance, it looks as 
though incomes have more than tripled over this 35-year stretch.
But, in fact, almost all that apparent gain in income is 
canceled out by inflation. Over that same 35-year period, the 
average price level has more than tripled as well. Some items 
have risen even more. ­College costs have sky-
rocketed: A year of tuition, room, and board at 
Yale University was $8,140 in the 1979–1980 
school year. As of the 2015–2016 school year, 
it was $62,200, an increase of ­almost eight 
times.
So, if you merely compared household 
­income over time without looking at changes in 
prices, you would run the risk of suffering from 
money illusion. Money illusion is the mistake 
that we make when we compare dollar 
amounts in different periods without 
adjusting for inflation.
Here’s an example of money illusion. 
From 1955 to 1960, on a television show 
called The Millionaire, an eccentric old 
industrialist supposedly gave away a 
million dollars each week to a lucky per-
son (it was staged, though). In 1999, a 
new television show called Who Wants 
to Be a Millionaire debuted, on which 
contestants answered Regis ­Philbin’s 
questions with the ultimate goal of win-
ning a million dollars. But when we look 
at the statistics published by the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics, we see that inflation 
has taken its toll on the prize: the aver-
age price level rose by more than six 
times between 1955 and 1999. So Regis 
would have to have given away more 
than $6 million to match the purchasing 
power of that anonymous (and fake) 
1955 millionaire. 
Avoiding Money Illusion
Suppose we have a quantity measured in dollars over time, 
such as our salary, the budget of our city or state, the price of 
our home, or the amount of money we have in the bank. To 
avoid money illusion, we must compare the change in these 
dollar figures with the inflation rate.
For example, suppose you are working and earning 
$50,000 per year. Your boss offers you a 3 percent raise of 
$1,500. Is that good news? It depends on the inflation rate. If 
inflation is running at 2 percent per year, then your 3 percent 
raise gives you an increase in purchasing power. But if the 
inflation rate is 4 percent, you are actually losing purchasing 
power because even with the increase, your income is going 
up more slowly than the average price level.
To avoid money illusion, the solution is to use the real 
change, which is the change in the money value after re-
moving the effects of inflation (this is also sometimes called 
the inflation-adjusted change). A good rule of thumb for 
calculating the real change is to take the percentage change 
in dollars minus the inflation rate (there is a more precise 
formula for calculating the real change, which 
we show in the next section). We call the in-
crease or decrease in a money value without 
adjusting for inflation the nominal change. So, 
if your nominal percentage change in wages is 
3 percent, and the inflation rate is 2 percent, 
then your real increase in wages is 3 percent 
minus 2 percent, or 1 percent. 
We can apply the same principle to any other 
economic quantity measured in dollars. For

CH 08 
Inflation
money illusion is to transform the original dollar figures 
(also called nominal dollars) into real dollars (also called 
inflation-adjusted dollars).
How do we do this? We pick a base year—say, 2015. We 
then use the consumer price index to adjust the nominal dol-
lar figures for any other year to get real figures that eliminate 
the effects of inflation. The result is reported in “2015 dol-
lars” or whatever the base year is.
Let’s give a simple example first. Suppose that you earned 
$100,000 in 2015. Your boss decides to give you a raise of 
3.2 percent in 2015, or $3,200 (that’s 3.2 percent × $100,000). 
That seems like a fair amount of money.
But then you realize that the inflation rate in 2016 is 3.2 per-
cent also, which cancels out your entire raise. In other words, 
your 2016 salary, expressed in 2015 dollars, is still $100,000. 
There’s been no change in the your real salary at all!
Here is a formula for transforming a nominal amount into 
a real amount:
Real money amount = Nominal money amount × 
(Consumer price index for base year/Consumer price 
index for current year)
For example, suppose we wanted to calculate real 
wages in 2015 dollars. According to the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, in 2007 the average hourly wage for all workers 
was $20.92. By 2015, the average hourly wage had risen to 
$25.03. At first glance, that seems like a pretty good 
increase.
But, over the same stretch, the consumer price index rose 
from 207.3 in 2007 to 237.0 in 2015. So the real hourly wage 
in 2007, expressed in 2015 dollars, is: 
Real hourly wage in 2007 = $20.92 × (237.0/207.3)
This calculation is outlined in Table 8.3. The third ­column 
reports the nominal wage for the two years. The fourth 
­column reports the real wage, which is obtained by multiply-
ing the second column—the inflation adjustment—by the 
nominal wage in the third column.
SPOTLIGHT: WHICH MOVIE 
EARNED MORE MONEY?
Every year, Hollywood proudly announces that a new 
blockbuster movie has broken all records. In 2015, 
for example, the top-grossing film was Star Wars: The 
Force Awakens, which had domestic ticket sales of 
$936 million (as of April 2016). By comparison, in 
1977 the first Star Wars film earned a seemingly far 
less impressive $461 million in domestic ticket sales. 
	
But it turns out that when we adjust for rising ticket 
prices, the young Han Solo beat the old Han Solo with 
no problem. Measured in 2015 dollars,  the first Star 
Wars took in an astounding $1,500 million in domestic 
ticket sales.

­example, it’s important to adjust for inflation when we’re look-
ing at government budgets. Spending by a government agency 
may rise—but if it doesn’t go up as fast as inflation, then the 
real value of the budget is falling and the agency is actually 
spending less, not more.
One example is federal spending on elementary and 
­secondary education, which includes direct grants to the 
states, as well as things like the early education program 
Head Start, which assists children from low-income fami-
lies. Federal spending on elementary and secondary educa-
tion rose from $39.7 billion in 2006 to $40 billion in 2007; 
that was an 0.8 percent increase. But with inflation running 
at about 2.5 percent, real federal education spending actually 
declined by 1.7 percent (0.8% − 2.5%).

As shown in Table 8.3, the real hourly wage in 2007 was 
$23.92, measured in 2015 dollars. That’s just a bit lower than 
the $25.03 average hourly wage in 2015. So shifting to real 
dollars has shown us that wages, adjusted for inflation, went up 
between 2007 and 2015, but far less than it appeared at first.
EXPECTATIONS  
AND INFLATION  LO8-4 
So far, we’ve been discussing how the average price level 
has changed over time. In effect, we’ve been looking back-
ward and comparing different years. Now we will look for-
ward into the future and introduce the intriguing idea of 
expected inflation. Expected inflation, as the name implies, 
is the inflation rate that consumers and businesses expect will 
happen over the next year or even further into the future.
Expected inflation forms the basis for pricing and wage 
­decisions that businesses make. For example, if you are a com-
pany manager, and you expect a 1 percent inflation rate over 
the next year, you know your workers will need a 
1 percent raise to stay even with inflation, and 
you will need to raise your prices by 1 percent to 
cover your increased costs of doing business. Or 
if you are proposing a budget for a government 
agency and the expected rate of inflation is 3 per-
cent, you start with the assumption that the 
agency will need a budget increase of 3 percent if 
it is to deliver the same ­services next year.
Businesses and individuals form their inflation expecta-
tions based on their recent experience. So if inflation has 
been running at only 2 percent a year, 
people generally ­expect that low rate to 
continue. If inflation is 10 percent a 
year, that gets built into expectations as 
well. There’s a ­certain amount of iner-
tia in expectations. 
Expected inflation can be changed 
by events. For example, if the price of 
gasoline soars from, say, $2 a gallon to 
$6 a gallon, there’s a risk that people 
will now expect that this higher rate of 
inflation will continue. A wage–price 
spiral occurs when businesses and 
workers boost prices and wages faster 
and faster to stay ahead of higher ex-
pected inflation. An economy stuck in 
a wage–price spiral is like a dog chas-
ing its own tail. Expected inflation 
rises, so everyone boosts prices and wages more, which 
drives up ­expected inflation even faster.
Hyperinflation
In the extreme case, inflation turns into  
hyperinflation—where prices soar at 20 per-
cent, 50 percent, or more per year. The 
United States has not seen hyperinflation in 
recent memory, but other countries have. 
When hyperinflation hits, businesses and 
workers have no choice but to start building 
expected inflation into prices and wages, and inflation 
gets deeply embedded into the economy. If you were

SPOTLIGHT: THE OIL TRIGGER
What starts a wage–price spiral? One cause, at least in the 
United States, is a sharp rise in oil prices. Because every 
industry needs energy, an oil price increase affects every 
part of the economy. That puts pressure on many compa-
nies to raise prices.
	
As mentioned in Chapter 6, the 1973 oil price shock 
happened in October after Egypt and Syria invaded ­Israel. 
While the war was still going on, the Arab oil-­producing 
countries—led by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, and Iraq—­
announced a sharp cut in oil production. In addition, these 
companies put an embargo on oil ­exports to the United 
States and some other western European countries that 
were supporting Israel.
	
The oil embargo sent prices leaping—not just the prices 
of gasoline and heating fuel, but all sorts of other prices, too. 
Businesses of all kinds had to pay higher energy costs to run 
their factories, heat and cool their offices, and transport their 
goods. As a result, they hiked the prices for their products. 
On top of that, companies had to invest a lot of money to buy 
more energy-efficiency equipment to try to use less energy.
	
The results were a big jump in the general price level 
(inflation) and a corresponding rise in expected ­inflation. 
What followed was a wage–price spiral that sent the infla-
tion rate over 10 percent. Another oil price shock in 1979 
followed the Iranian Revolution that ­deposed the Shah of 
Iran. Again, energy prices soared, and both inflation and 
inflation expectations rose. As we will see in Chapter 12, 
the wage–price spiral did not end until the Federal Re-
serve took drastic action.
	
More recently, oil prices spiked in mid-2008 without 
causing a wage–price spiral. The jump did not last very 
long, so businesses and workers did not raise their ­inflation 
expectations. Indeed, the price of oil has fallen sharply 
since then, helping keep inflation ­expectations low.

Inflation
running a restaurant, you would no longer print menus. 
Instead you might put up a chalkboard with prices on it 
and raise the prices every day—or even twice a day.
Governments fervently want to avoid hyperinflation be-
cause it completely undercuts citizens’ faith in the value of 
their money. In this situation, if workers are paid for their 
jobs in the morning, the value of the money has substantially 
fallen by the afternoon. People stop thinking about the 
future.
The most famous hyperinflation ­episode occurred in 
Germany in the 1920s. In 1919, one dollar was worth 8.9 
­German marks (a mark was the German currency at the 
time). By 1923, one dollar was worth 1 trillion marks. In  
effect, German money was worth nothing, and barter became 
the order of the day. ­People’s savings, pensions, and life  
insurance became valueless. Most economic historians be-
lieve that the economic devastation from this hyperinflation 
was one factor that, by disrupting the German economy and 
undermining faith in the government, laid the groundwork 
for the Nazi takeover of Germany in the 1930s.
More recently, several South American countries have 
experienced hyperinflation, though not as bad as the ­German 
case. From 1989 to 1994, Brazil endured several years of 
inflation greater than 1,000 percent, which means that prices 
rose by 10 times in a year. In 1985, Bolivia’s inflation rate 
went more than 11,000 percent. That means average prices 
went up by more than 100 times over the year. Or to put it a 
different way, a dollar would be worth a penny by the end of 
the year, and if a newspaper cost $1 at the beginning of the 
year, it would cost $100 by December.
To cope with hyperinflation, countries have to keep 
­issuing currency in bigger and bigger denominations. For 
example, during its period of hyperinflation, Bolivia issued 
currency bills worth 10 million bolivianos each (the boliviano 
was the Bolivian currency then). Another alternative is to 
change the name of the currency and 
replace old bills with new ones. For  
example, in 1986 Brazil replaced its 
former currency, the cruzeiro, with the 
cruzado. The conversion formula was 
that each cruzado replaced 1,000 
cruzeiros (in 1986, $1 was worth about 
13 cruzados).
The Harm from Unexpected Inflation
What damage does inflation do? We’ll examine two different 
cases. In this section, we’ll look at the impacts of unexpected 
inflation, when the actual inflation rate is much higher than 
expected. In the next section, we’ll consider more downsides 
of expected inflation.
Unexpected inflation happens when the rate of price in-
creases suddenly accelerates well above what businesses and 
individuals were expecting. For anyone who is locked into a 
long-term contract of any sort, that makes a big difference. If 
you are supposed to receive money, unexpected inflation is 
bad for you. If you are supposed to pay money, unexpected 
inflation is good for you.
For example, consider the situation of lenders. A loan 
­involves a transfer of money from lender to borrower, plus a 
To understand how unexpected inflation hurts lenders, 
let’s consider the simple example of a candy economy. 
Amanda has $10, which can buy a nice box of choco-
lates. But, instead, she lends Sam the $10 for a month, 
expecting to get back $10 plus $2 in interest (she figures 
the $2 will allow her to buy a soda to go along with the 
chocolate).
	
Unfortunately, over the month, there is a sudden 
shortage of cocoa, and the price of a box of chocolate 
doubles to $20. So at the end of the month, when Sam 
gives Amanda $12 (the $10 plus interest), she can no 
longer afford the nice box of chocolates. Instead, she 
has to settle for some M&Ms. As a lender, she has 
­become the victim of an unexpected surge of candy 
­inflation. If she had known this was coming, she would 
have asked for more interest or simply bought the 
chocolate before its price went up.

promise from the borrower to pay back the money with 
­interest some time in the future. For example, the bank 
might lend you $100 with the requirement that you will pay 
back the money, plus $10 in interest, next year.
The problem for the lender is that if the price level unex-
pectedly jumps, that means borrowers get to pay back their 
loans with less valuable dollars. Suppose inflation unex-
pectedly turns out to be 10 percent for the year. When the 
bank receives repayment of its loan, the repayment is worth 
10 percent less. In fact, if the inflation rate is high enough, 
the bank may actually lose money on the loan. Unexpected 
inflation helps borrowers, at least temporarily, because they 
are paying back their loans with inflated dollars. (See “How 
It Works: Why Unexpected Inflation Hurts Lenders.”)
But the benefits to borrowers from unexpected inflation 
evaporate as soon as lenders realize that prices are rising. At 
that point, they start raising their interest rates to compen-
sate for the fact they are getting paid back in inflated dollars. 
That’s what happened in the early part of the 1980s, when 
lenders kept interest rates high because they worried about a 
recurrence of the inflation of the 1970s.
The Harm from Expected Inflation
What happens if everyone expects the same rate of infla-
tion that actually occurs? What is the harm from expected 
inflation? We’ve already mentioned hyperinflation. But 
what if inflation were only 7 percent or so? It might seem 
that expected inflation would be harmless if wages and sala-
ries rise at the same rate as prices. If prices go up by 7 per-
cent and wages go up by 7 percent, everyone is in the same 
relative situation they were in before, and nothing has really 
changed. In fact, one response to the high-inflation era of the 
1970s was to put cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) into 
many union contracts and government programs such as 
­Social Security. A COLA automatically raises wages to 
compensate for inflation so that if inflation is 7 percent, 
wages rise by 7 percent. Similarly, Social Security recipients 
have been protected from inflation since 1972: their pay-
ments rise along with consumer prices.
However, over time, even expected inflation is a problem. 
First, if employers automatically bump up wages for infla-
tion, they will have to raise prices to compensate for their in-
creased costs. Thus, cost-of-living adjustments build inflation 
into the economy and make a wage–price spiral more likely.
Second, economists have learned that higher levels of 
­inflation are less predictable. If inflation is running at 2 per-
cent this year, you can be pretty sure it will be close to 2 percent 
next year. But an inflation rate of 7 percent could be 12 per-
cent or 3 percent next year. This makes it hard for businesses 
and households to make good decisions.
Finally, high levels of inflation increase the cost of 
transactions—the time and effort that go into managing your 
spending. If inflation is low, you can keep spending money in 
your checking account, where it is easy to get to, because you 
don’t have to worry about it losing value. But if the average 
price level is rising quickly, you don’t want to keep much money 
in cash or checking accounts because it 
quickly loses value. So, you have to spend 
a lot of time making sure your money is 
in money market funds or someplace else 
where it will earn a high enough return to 
compensate for inflation.
The consensus among most econo-
mists is that policymakers should aim 
to keep inflation low—in the words of 
former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan, “so low and stable over 
time that it does not materially enter 
into the decisions of households and 
firms.” That level is generally accepted 
to be around 2 percent a year.
Deflation
If inflation is undesirable, why not 
strive for deflation? Deflation is an 
­actual fall in the average price level. 
Don’t confuse it with disinflation, 
which is a reduction in the inflation rate. If the inflation rate 
is 5 percent one year and 4 percent the next, that’s disinfla-
tion. But if the inflation rate is −1 percent, that’s deflation.
After the inflation shocks of the 1970s, economists were 
much more worried about inflation than deflation. How-
ever, in recent years, inflation has slowed in most industri-
alized countries, in some cases getting close to zero. In 
Japan, the average price index in early 2016 was barely 
above 2000 levels.
Economists generally agree that sustained deflation is not 
good for an economy. First, deflation usually means demand 
is so weak that businesses cannot raise their prices and 
workers cannot ask for higher wages. In order words, defla-
tion is a sign of a poorly functioning economy. 
The second problem with deflation has to do with loans. 
Remember that inflation hurts lenders because borrowers 
pay back loans in dollars that are worth less than expected. 
In the same way, deflation hurts borrowers because they are 
paying back loans with dollars that are worth more than 
­expected. Indeed, if deflation hits wages as well as prices, 
your income may drop, but the size of that loan you took out 
stays the same. That’s not a recipe for a happy life.
In the aftermath of the Great Recession, avoiding defla-
tion became a major goal for economic policymakers in the 
United States, Japan, and Europe. As this text is being 
­revised in 2016, that effort is still under way. 
CONCLUSION
We’ve seen how inflation can change our picture of the econ-
omy. A high rate of inflation can eat away at the value of 
household income, wages, and any other monetary quantities. 
But prices are not the only things that change over time. 
In the next chapter, we will see how the economy’s output 
changes over time as well.

SUMMARY
	 1.	Inflation is a sustained upward movement in the 
­average level of prices. The inflation rate is the annual 
percentage change in the average price level or its 
equivalent, the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The infla-
tion rate in 2007, for example, was the percentage 
change in the CPI from 2006 to 2007. (LO8-1)
	 2.	A relative price shift happens when the inflation rate 
of a good or service is significantly higher or lower 
than the overall inflation rate. Some goods or services 
have been getting relatively cheaper over time, 
whereas others have been getting relatively more 
­expensive. (LO8-2)
	 3.	Money illusion occurs when we compare dollar 
amounts in different periods without adjusting for 
­inflation. To avoid money illusion, we need to adjust 
nominal changes in dollar amounts by the rate of infla-
tion to get real changes. (LO8-3)
	 4.	Expected inflation is the inflation rate that consumers 
and businesses expect will hold over the next year. 
Unexpected inflation happens when the rate of price 
increases suddenly accelerates above expected infla-
tion. Unexpected inflation hurts lenders and anyone 
who is supposed to receive money under a long-term 
contract. Unexpected inflation helps anyone who is 
supposed to pay money under a long-term contract. A 
high level of expected inflation is harmful because it 
makes a wage–price spiral more likely, because it is 
unpredictable, and because it increases the cost of 
transactions. (LO8-4)

In this chapter, we will look at the ben-
efits of economic growth. We will explore 
how growth is defined and measured. 
­Finally, we will look at the key factors that 
help drive a country’s economic growth 
over the long run.
H
ere’s the most important fact about 
modern economies: almost without 
exception, they grow over the long run. 
True, the United States was recently hit by a 
deep economic downturn that cut the pro-
duction of goods and services for several 
years. But the general trend is still upward 
in most countries. For example, as of 2015 
the global economy was about 40 percent 
larger than it was in 2005, ten years earlier. 
	
This record of success is encouraging 
and challenging at the same time. It’s en-
couraging because when a country pro-
duces more goods and services, almost 
everyone is better off. An expanding econ-
omy almost always boosts living standards 
for the poor, frees up resources for the 
public sector, and lets the middle class 
­enjoy more luxuries. But it’s challenging 
because economic growth in a market 
economy often requires change and tur-
moil that make people uncomfortable.

CH 09 
Growth
THE SIGNIFICANCE  
OF GROWTH  LO9-1 
What does it mean for an economy to grow 
from one year to the next? Simply put, an econ-
omy experiences economic growth if its pro-
duction of goods and services increases. For 
example, suppose we have a simple economy 
that produces only one product: haircuts. This economy 
grows if its barbers and hairdressers begin providing more 
haircuts than in the past. (When an economy is growing, we 
also say it is “getting bigger.”)
Improved Living Standards
Of course, actual economies usually produce a much 
wider range of goods and services than just haircuts. In 
general, a growing economy usually 
produces more necessities, such as 
more food, better housing, and easier 
access to education and health care. A 
growing economy also generates more 
resources for leisure, recreation, and 
entertainment. In other words, eco-
nomic growth makes most people bet-
ter off in many different ways, both 
tangible and intangible.
What does this mean in concrete terms? 
Here’s a simple comparison. Today, thanks to 
economic growth, virtually all homes in the 
United States have complete plumbing facili-
ties (defined as hot and cold running water, a 
bathtub or shower, and a flushable toilet). But 
as recently as 1940, almost half of all U.S. 
homes lacked one or more of these essentials. 
That means a big change has occurred in the quality of 
daily life.
Or take something essential like the survival rate of new-
borns. In 1950, there were 29 infant deaths for every 1,000 
live births in the United States. Over the next half century, 
the U.S. economy grew enough to make it possible to devote 
more resources to better health care for pregnant women and 
newborns. As a result, the infant mortality rate plunged to 
only 5.9 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015. That’s 
still not as low as in some other industrialized countries, but 
it’s far better than in the past.
On the lighter side, a bigger economy can also provide 
more variety in entertainment. In the 1960s a typical house-
hold had access to fewer than 10 broadcast television chan-
nels. Then cable television raised the number of available 
channels to 100 or more. Today, the Internet opens a vast 
number of entertainment choices. And people are not just 
sitting in front of screens—they are going more places as 
well (see “Spotlight: Growth and Travel”).
ECONOMIC GROWTH
The increase in an 
economy’s production 
of goods and services. 
Usually measured by 
the growth in gross 
domestic product 
­adjusted for inflation.
LO9-1
Explain the 
­benefits of 
­economic growth.
SPOTLIGHT: GROWTH AND TRAVEL
Have you traveled abroad recently? In 2014, U.S. residents made 
31 million plane trips overseas (that includes all countries except 
­Mexico and Canada).
	
But it isn’t just U.S. residents who are flying around the globe. 
Overseas travel is expensive, requiring enough money for a plane 
ticket, hotel rooms, and shopping. So, a sure sign of economic 
growth in a country is when ordinary people have enough money 
and leisure time to travel overseas.
	
In the 1980s, a wave of Japanese tourists hit the shores of the 
United States and other countries, reflecting increased prosperity in 
Japan. More recently, there has been an explosion of tourists from 
eastern Europe, China, and India as economic growth has boosted the 
number of people who can afford to travel. All across the ­country, from 
New York to San Francisco, tourist destinations are experiencing 
­sky-high levels of foreign tourists.
	
Looking globally, international tourist trips increased by 66 per-
cent between 2000 and 2014—much faster than the 19 percent 
growth of the world population (see Figure 9.1). As long as the world 
economy continues to expand, this trend of rising tourism should 
continue.

Growth versus the Zero-Sum Economy
If there is no growth, we have a zero-sum economy. 
This means if we want the economy to produce more of 
something—say health care—we have to accept less of 
something else—perhaps entertainment. In Figure 9.4, if we 
are stuck on the same production possibility frontier (that is, 
no growth), then moving from point A 
to point C gives us more health care 
and less entertainment.
In contrast, a growing economy is 
non-zero-sum. So as the production 
possibility frontier moves outward, we 
could potentially get more of both 
health care and entertainment (point B 
in Figure 9.4).
This argument can be extended to 
income distribution. In an economy 
without growth, the only way for some-
one to get more goods and services is 
for someone else to get less—like kids 
squabbling over a piece of cake. More 
specifically, without growth, the only 
way to make low-income households 
better off is to take money away from 
middle-income or high-income house-
holds. (We’ll examine income distribu-
tion in more detail in Chapter 17.)
On the other hand, it is possible for 
everyone to see their incomes rise if

As the economy grows, the production possibility frontier

Production Possibility Frontier
One consequence of economic growth is that it gives us 
more choices. To see this, we will define the production 
possibility frontier (PPF) as all the combinations of differ-
ent goods and services the economy is capable of producing 
at a particular time, assuming full use of all resources. To 
illustrate, let’s look at a production possibility frontier for 
two outputs: health care and entertainment, shown in Fig-
ure 9.2. The PPF shows the different combinations of health 
care and entertainment the economy can achieve given our 
current state of knowledge and physical inputs. (Of course, 
we could draw a PPF with any other two goods and services 
the economy can produce, like food and cars, or haircuts 
and homes.)
In this figure, the vertical axis measures the amount of 
entertainment the economy can produce, whereas the hori-
zontal axis measures the amount of health care the economy 
can produce. The curved line shows all the different combi-
nations of health care and entertainment that are possible. 
We can build hospitals, or movie studios, or some combina-
tion of them. Point A on the figure shows one possible com-
bination of health care and entertainment that the economy 
can produce in a year.
If the economy grows, the PPF moves outward, as shown 
in Figure 9.3. That is, the economy has a greater capability 
of producing more health care, or more entertainment, or 
both. Point B is one possible combination of health care and 
entertainment, but the economy is capable of producing any 
other combination on the PPF.

the economy gets bigger. In a growing economy, both rich 
and poor can enjoy a rising standard of living.
In fact, that is what has happened in the United States 
over the past 50 years. As the U.S. economy expanded after 
World War II, the living standard of poor people in the 
United States improved as well. Fewer people went hungry, 
the quality of housing rose, and virtually everyone acquired 
a television set. Now cell phones and access to the Internet 
are fast spreading into low-income households. As of 2015, 
81 percent of U.S. households had a broadband connection 
at home.
In the poorest countries, economic growth can make a 
tremendous difference for the people at the bottom of the 
income ladder—even in something as basic as whether they 
have enough food to eat. As we will see later in this chapter, 
China has been able to maintain strong growth since the 
early 1980s, and India since the early 1990s. The result has 
been a sharp fall in the proportions of their populations that 
are undernourished.
What Growth Doesn’t Buy
To finish this section, let us be clear: Economic growth is 
not the only measure of a successful society. As we saw in 
Chapter 7, growth has not necessarily made us happier, at 
least judging by recent surveys. No one did such surveys 
back in 1900, but we cannot dismiss the possibility that peo-
ple then were poorer than we are now but just 
as happy.
Moreover, there are other ways in which 
growth may have negative effects. Economic 
research suggests that the falling relative prices 
of food over time have increased food con-
sumption. This may contribute to obesity—one 
of the key health issues ­facing the United States today. 
(We’ll discuss the economics of health care in Chapter 18.)
Finally, as we’ll see in Chapter 19, published figures on 
economic growth leave out the issue of its impact on the en-
vironment, including global warming. Some of the impacts 
are quite serious, but we do not account for them when mea-
suring growth.
Still, all other things being equal, economists generally 
believe that economic growth is a positive event. Few people 
cheer if government statisticians announce a low growth 
number.
MEASURING GROWTH  LO9-2 
A typical economy produces a wide variety of goods and 
services, such as food, homes, cars, haircuts, and television 
shows. From Chapter 7, we already know we can combine 
these different goods and services into one number, gross 
domestic product (GDP), which measures the output of an 
economy in dollars. An increase in GDP over time can indi-
cate economic growth.
However, we have to be careful here. There are two 
­reasons the dollar amount of output might rise, and only 
one of them counts as economic growth. First, an economy 
may ­actually be producing more food, homes, cars, hair-
cuts, and so forth. Or it may be producing the same amount 
of goods and ­services—or even less—but 
prices have gone up. That is, inflation may 
make it look as though the economy has 
grown more than it really has. How do we 
know the truth?
The solution is to adjust GDP growth for in-
flation. In practice, that’s a challenging task.

the prices of all items that go into GDP, including business

The Bureau of Economic Analysis regularly reports the 
growth rate of the U.S. economy, which represents the 
percentage increase in real gross domestic product. 
For example, in 2003 real GDP was $13,271 billion, 
measured in 2009 dollars. In 2004, real GDP was 
$13,773 billion, measured in 2009 dollars. The growth 
rate from 2003 to 2004 was 3.8 percent.

­investment, government consumption 
and investment, and foreign trade.
The BEA then adjusts GDP for in-
flation, using its estimate of the average 
price level for the whole economy. The 
result is called real GDP, which is 
gross domestic product adjusted for inflation. It is usually 
measured in 2009 dollars (as we defined in Chapter 8). 
When real GDP is increasing, that means that the output of 
the economy, adjusted for inflation, is increasing as well. As 
a result, economic growth is measured by the growth in real 
GDP over time.
When real GDP growth is positive, the economy’s pro-
duction of goods and services is increasing, and the econ-
omy is growing. For example, in 2004 the economic growth 
rate of the U.S. economy was 3.8 percent. That means the 
economy produced 3.8 percent more goods and services in 
2004 than in 2003.
Looking at Figure 9.5, we can see clear signs of the Great 
Recession. Real GDP growth was negative in both 2008 and 
2009. When growth is negative, that means the economy is 
shrinking.
GDP versus Real GDP
Let’s make a clear distinction between GDP and real GDP. 
The growth rate of GDP includes both economic growth and 
the effects of inflation. In contrast, the growth rate of real 
GDP removes the effects of inflation. (See “How It Works: 
Calculating the Growth Rate.”) Table 9.1 shows the relation-
ship between GDP and real GDP in recent years.

Growth
A Word of Warning
Keep in mind that a rise in real GDP for a 
whole economy doesn’t mean the quantity of 
any particular good or service is also rising. It’s 
possible for some parts of the economy to be 
shrinking while other parts are expanding. In 
2007, for example, residential investment 
dropped sharply because fewer new homes 
were built. At the same time, though, house-
holds and businesses were spending more on 
computers and health care than ever before, 
helping real GDP rise overall.
THE INCREASE IN LIVING 
STANDARDS  LO9-3 
So far in this chapter, we’ve been talking about the growth 
rate of real GDP—that is, the rate at which the production of 
the whole economy is expanding. Now let’s bring growth 
down to the level of the individual consumer. Remember 
that Chapter 7 defined GDP per capita as the gross domestic 
product divided by the population of the country—in other 
words, the amount of economic output each person would 
get if we split up the entire economy evenly and gave every-
one a piece. As we saw, this is a rough measure of the aver-
age standard of living in the economy.
Now we can ask, “How fast is the 
average standard of living rising?” To 
answer this, we want to look at the 
change in GDP per capita. Of course 
we have to adjust for the effects of in-
flation. That means we’re interested in 
the growth in real GDP per capita.

Real GDP is measured in 2009 dollars, which removes the effects of inflation. The third column shows the growth rate of GDP,

Dividing real GDP by the size of the population gives us real 
GDP per capita. From 2013 to 2014, real GDP per capita 
grew by 1.9 percent.
For example, in 2013 real GDP was $15,583 
billion measured in 2009 dollars, as shown in 
Table 9.1 and reproduced in Table 9.2. The U.S. 
population was 316.8 million. Thus, the real 
GDP per capita in 2013 was $49,190 (in 2009 
dollars). If we divided real GDP equally among 
every man, woman, and child in the country, 
that’s how much each person would get. In 
­Table 9.2, we also do the same calculation for 
2014 and come up with a real GDP per capita 
equal to $50,000 in year 2009 dollars. The 
growth rate of real GDP per capita equals the percentage 
change from 2013 to 2014, which in this case is 1.6 percent.

Short-Term versus Long-Term Growth
So far we have been looking at yearly growth, which falls 
into the category of short-term growth. But it’s also useful 
to look at long-term growth, which is the average growth 
rate over 5 or 10 years or longer. In particular, we can look 
back and see how real GDP per capita has changed over his-
tory, which gives us some insight into how the standard of 
living has changed. The chart of U.S. real GDP per capita in 
Figure 9.6 shows how much living standards have risen over 
more than two centuries.
With only a couple of major interruptions, real GDP per 
capita has been on a steady upward climb since the United 
States was founded. For example, let’s look at 1915 on the 
chart. The president was Woodrow Wilson, Russia was still 
ruled by a czar, and India was a British colony. Back then, 
real GDP per capita in the United States in inflation-adjusted 
2009 dollars was $6,113. Jump forward a cen-
tury: In 2015, real GDP per capita was $50,820 
in 2009 dollars. That’s an eightfold increase in 
a century, or an average real growth rate of 
roughly 2.1 percent per year.
Here’s another way to think about this. The 
much lower real GDP per capita in 1915, com-
pared to 2015, reflects the lack of many goods 
and services that we take for granted today. In 1905, you 
couldn’t take an airplane trip, ­listen to the radio, watch tele-
vision, or use a computer ­because none of these technolo-
gies were in commercial use or even existed. Automobiles 
were rare, and antibiotics were not 
part of the medical toolkit. In effect, 
the ­productive capability of the econ-
omy was far lower—and so were liv-
ing standards.
WHAT DRIVES 
GROWTH  LO9-4 
What forces drive economic growth? 
What determines whether growth is 
fast or slow? In Chapter 4, you learned 
the production function of a business 
has five inputs: labor, capital, land, 
intermediate inputs, and business 
know-how. Given the levels of the different inputs, the 
production function tells us the output level 
of the business.
Similarly, the aggregate production function 
tells us the output, or GDP, of the economy, given 
its inputs. The list of inputs for the aggregate pro-
duction function includes the number of workers 
in the country (labor); the education and skill 
levels of these workers (what economists call hu-
man capital); equipment and structures (physical capital); raw 
materials, such as oil and iron ore (which come from the land); 
and a final category we will call knowledge (which includes 
both technology and business know-how).

CH 09 
Growth
The economy grows when these in-
puts grow. That is, as the number of 
workers increases, the output of the 
economy tends to rise. Similarly, output 
rises as workers become more educated 
and skilled, as more physical capital is 
used, as more raw materials are mined 
and used, and as the economy accumu-
lates more knowledge, as shown in Fig-
ure 9.7. In other words, the forces driving 
growth are the increases in the five dif-
ferent inputs to the ­aggregate production function.
Increase in Labor
As the number of workers increases, output increases, too, 
even if nothing else changes. That makes sense. A country 
like the United States experiences some growth simply be-
cause the number of workers generally increases over time.
In 2005, for example, the U.S. labor force—the number 
of people either working or actively looking for jobs—was 
149.3 million. In 2015, the labor force was 157.1 million. 
On average, the U.S. labor force has grown roughly 0.5 per-
cent per year over the past decade. 
The Census Bureau—the government agency that does 
population projections—expects the working-age population 
of the United States to keep growing as the country contin-
ues to attract immigrants and as today’s young people reach 
working age. 
Increase in Education and Skills
Another way to boost aggregate production is to increase 
the skills or education levels of the workforce—that is, to

SPOTLIGHT: COMMUNITY 
COLLEGES AND ECONOMIC 
GROWTH
One essential force in the growth of human capital over the 
past several decades has been the community college 
system. Community colleges have been around for at least 
a century, but enrollments soared in the 1960s and 1970s. 
In 1963, enrollment in two-year colleges was 850,000. By 
1973, this figure was 3 million, and by 1983, it had risen to 
4.7 million. As of 2014, ­almost 7 million students were  
enrolled in two-year ­colleges across the country.
	
The top fields for associate degrees in 2013–2014 
were liberal arts, health professions, and business. 
These three fields together accounted for nearly 70 per-
cent of all associate degrees nationally. ­Following far 
­behind are protective services (such as law ­enforcement 
and homeland security) and computer and information 
sciences. As people graduate from community colleges 
and enter the workforce, their new education and skills 
contribute directly to the growth of GDP.
increase human capital. In general, better-trained and 
educated ­workers can produce more. Education helps 
­future workers develop critical skills. Equally important, 
educated workers seem to have an easier time adapting to 
new technology.

 	
CH 09 
Growth	
157
The education level of the U.S. workforce is much higher 
than it was in the past. Figure 9.8 shows that in 1965, only 
about 13 percent of U.S. adults between the ages of 25 and 
29 had a college education. Back then, it was more common 
for people to graduate from high school and go directly into 
a factory job. As of 2015, 35.6 percent of U.S. adults aged 
25–29 had at least a bachelor’s degree.
Equally important, it’s become far more common to have 
at least some exposure to post–high school education. This 
change is related to the dramatic rise of two-year colleges, 
which today enroll almost 7 million students (see “Spotlight: 
Community Colleges and Economic Growth”).
Investment in Physical Capital
Economists have long focused on investment in physical capi-
tal—firms’ purchases of equipment and buildings for produc-
tion—as an essential ingredient for growth. Amost nothing 
can be done in today’s economy without relying on or using 
physical capital in some way. You can’t take goods or passen-
gers across the ocean without a ship or a plane; you can’t em-
ploy workers comfortably without putting a roof over their 
heads; and you can’t build computers without factories to 
make microprocessors, memory chips, and video screens.
Generally, if we give a worker more and better equipment 
to use, we can assume that once the worker learns which 
buttons to press, he or she will be able to produce more out-
put than with less useful equipment. A driver with a truck 
can deliver more packages than a messenger on a bicycle. A 
construction worker with a giant crane can lift more material 
faster than the same worker with a hand truck.
The positive impact of increased investment in physical 
capital is very strong in poor countries, where rural farmers 
and low-end workers have poor access to any machinery or 
equipment, and adding even a little can make a big difference. 
But investment in new equipment, software, and buildings is 
also an important driving force for growth in a developed 
country such as the United States. For example, if you order a 
shirt online, you are relying on the wires and fiber optic con-
nections that link you to the retailer. You are also relying on 
the retailer’s computers, which are housed in a building some-
where; on the designers and marketers of the shirt, who pre-
sumably work in an office building in the United States; and on 
fleets of ships and trucks that eventually bring the shirt from 
the factory, which may be located in another country. Without 
all this physical capital, none of this would happen. (See 
“Spotlight: Capital Investment in the Age of the Internet.”)
An increase in physical capital can help an economy grow.

SPOTLIGHT: CAPITAL 
INVESTMENT IN THE AGE  
OF THE INTERNET
We usually think of the Internet as the ultimate intangi-
ble service. After all, the steady stream of data that 
feeds our mobile apps and laptop screens can’t be 
seen or touched. 
	
But it turns out that telecom companies such as 
AT&T and Comcast spend billions each year on building 
and maintaining the cables and cell phone towers that 
connect us to the Internet. Meanwhile, “edge providers” 
such as Google and Microsoft spend billions each 
year to build massive data centers around the world to 
execute nearly instantaneously all those searches its 
users request. In fact, these data centers are essential 
for competing in today’s information economy—even 
if your product is as intangible as an Internet search.
	
All told, in 2014 the information sector of the econ-
omy, including telecom and Internet companies, spent 
$110 billion on equipment and buildings. All that 
money shows up in faster Internet connections, better 
coverage for mobile phones, and a wider variety of 
useful Internet services.

Growth
Increase in Raw Materials
One essential input to growth is raw materials, which in-
clude everything from oil to iron ore to water. The impor-
tance of raw materials is obvious: you can’t put up a building 
without iron ore, which is used to make the steel beams that 
hold up the building. Water is essential for drinking and for 
agriculture. The list goes on and on.
Historically, economies have consumed 
more raw materials as they have grown. For 
example, the United States used roughly 
7 billion barrels of crude oil and petroleum 
products in 2015, up from 5.9 billion barrels 
in 1981. It’s possible, however, that environ-
mental considerations may slow this increase 
in raw material use in the future.
Increase in Knowledge
Increase in knowledge plays a crucial 
role in economic growth, especially in 
developed countries such as the United 
States. Why? Because better knowl-
edge means we have learned how to do 
something new, or learned how to pro-
duce something faster, better, or 
cheaper. In other words, we get smarter: 
we can produce more goods and ser-
vices with the same amount of re-
sources. For instance, food production 
has dramatically improved over the past 
50 years because of enhancements in agricultural tools and 
techniques, seeds, fertilizers, and all sorts of related things.
Increases in knowledge include progress in science and 
technology, by which we learn more about the laws of nature 
and how to apply them. The results include better medicine, 
faster computers, and quieter airplanes that use less fuel.
Increases in knowledge also include improved 
business know-how: our greater understanding 
of how to arrange economic activities. For ex-
ample, the invention of the credit card is impor-
tant to our daily lives—but this has less to do 
with technology and more about realizing that 
people needed an easy way to make purchases 
on credit. As knowledge expands, more things 
become possible, and the economy grows.
GOVERNMENT AND  
GROWTH  LO9-5 
As we saw in Chapter 6, the market economy does not func-
tion in a vacuum. The government plays an important role, 
setting laws and rules for everything from foreign trade to 
how mortgages are issued. (Laws are the actual legislation 
passed by Congress and state and local governments, 
whereas rules are the regulations issued by various govern-
ment agencies.)
Some laws and rules encourage growth by making mar-
kets work better. On the other hand, some laws and rules,

even if well-intended, can end up discouraging growth by 
making markets work less efficiently. 
Most economists favor less government interference in 
the marketplace as the strategy most likely to produce steady 
growth. The idea behind this preference is that corporations 
and individuals are in a better position than the government 
to know what kinds of investments are most likely to pay off. 
After all, they reason, the government should not tell Apple 
what kind of phones to make.  
Sometimes, it’s pretty clear that government 
is on the right track, exercising its power for the 
greater good. For instance, when a company is 
putting up a new structure such as an office 
building or a factory—an investment in physi-
cal capital—local governments often impose a 
long list of building code requirements, such as 
mandating a certain degree of resistance to fire, earthquakes, 
and storms. These requirements increase the cost of build-
ings and, therefore, slow down investment, but most people 
would agree that they are necessary.
Or consider the example of education. By law, everyone 
has to get an elementary and a high school education. That’s 
the minimum amount of human capital that U.S. families are 
required to invest in. However, legislators could just as easily 
require everyone to pass at least two years of college—if they 
were willing to spend billions of dollars to build and staff new 
community colleges. For now, however, most people agree 
that completion of high school is an acceptable minimum.
In many cases, however, exactly where we want to draw the 
line on government interference is a subject of intense political 
dispute. Immigration is one example. At 
one extreme, the government could step 
completely out of the role of controlling 
the movement of labor across the border. 
Then, immigration would be completely 
open. In the short run, this might have a 
positive ­effect on growth because the population and the work-
force would rise. But that’s clearly unacceptable to a large pro-
portion of citizens—and it would probably 
impose much bigger costs on local governments 
for education and health care.
We could keep offering examples because 
almost everything the government does—or 
doesn’t do—can affect growth. But as we pro-
ceed through the following chapters, we will 
see other ways in which the government has an 
­impact on growth. (For an example, see “Spotlight: The 
­Chinese Government and Growth.”)
PRODUCTIVITY  LO9-6 
How can we summarize all these forces driving economic 
growth? Remember from Chapter 4 that we defined the 
average product for a business as output per worker. 
­Productivity is the equivalent concept for the whole econ-
omy. That is, the productivity of an economy is its output 
for a given year divided by the total number of hours 
worked in that year, counting all workers. We use total 
hours, rather than number of workers, to adjust for the fact 
that not everyone puts in the same amount of time on the

SPOTLIGHT: THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AND GROWTH
China illustrates how a shift in government policy can  
alter the long-term growth rate of a country. Until the 
late 1970s, the Chinese economy was tightly run by the 
Communist Party. Farms were managed collectively, which 
means farmers did not own their production; instead, it 
was owned by the whole group. Most manufacturing was 
done in state-run factories with names like Beijing No. 7 
Paper Mill. The combination of the largest population in 
the world and an inefficient economy made China one of 
the poorest countries in the world. In 1980, its GDP per 
capita was only about $400, which ranked China 144 out 
of around 150 countries.
	
All that changed under Deng Xiaoping, leader of the 
Chinese Communist Party from 1978 to the early 1990s. 
Deng instituted a series of economic reforms that in-
cluded a move away from collective agriculture to more 
autonomy for individual households, such as deciding 
what to plant, choosing where to sell it, and getting 
much of the gains. Local officials and plant managers 
were given more freedom to run factories and 
­businesses for profit instead of producing to meet gov-
ernment quotas.
	
The Chinese government still plays a very important 
role in that country’s economy. Nevertheless, the increas-
ing importance of markets in China is a good example of 
the kinds of changes in laws and regulations that make an 
economy work better. In addition, the Chinese have been 
investing in human capital at a high rate. For example, they 
geared up their higher education system to produce more 
than 7.5 million college graduates in 2015, up from about 
1 million in 2001. That’s an astounding jump that will pay 
off in faster economic growth in China’s future. And China 
has been investing in knowledge: Today it ranks below 
only the United States in spending on research and 
development.
	
As a result, the Chinese economy has grown at an av-
erage rate of 10 percent per year for the past 25 years. It 
has struggled in recent years to maintain its rapid pace of 
growth. But at least for now, it’s a role model for other 
­developing countries.

job. A sales clerk in a department 
store may work 20 hours in a week, 
whereas a highly motivated factory 
worker may put in overtime and work 
60 hours a week; a corporate lawyer 
might work 90 hours.
Productivity is a key concept for 
measuring the health and prosperity of 
an economy. The higher the productiv-
ity, the more output an economy can 
produce with the same number of work-
ers. For example, China has more work-
ers than the United States does, 
especially if we count farmworkers. But 
the United States has a much bigger 
economy because U.S. workers are 
more productive—they can ­produce 
more with the same or fewer inputs as 
Chinese workers can.
The growth rate of productivity is 
the percentage increase in productivity 
over a year, and it is among the economic statistics that 
economists watch most closely. If productivity growth is 
rapid, the same number of workers can produce more goods 
and services. That’s good news: Companies can afford to 
pay higher wages and still make a profit. Periods of solid 
productivity growth are usually also periods of rising living 
standards.
In contrast, persistent low productivity growth is bad 
news for workers. Without productivity gains, businesses 
can’t afford to raise real wages. Eras of slow productivity 
growth are generally dismal. 
The History of U.S. Productivity Growth
Since the end of World War II, the United States has experi-
enced periods of both strong and weak productivity growth. 
Look at Figure 9.9, which shows the average rate of produc-
tivity growth for four different periods since 1947. One 
­important note here: the productivity number reported by 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics focuses on the output of the 
­“nonfarm business sector,” which leaves out government, 
housing, agriculture, and nonprofits.
The first period, from the end of World War II to roughly 
1973, was the Golden Age of U.S. growth. Productivity—
output per hour—rose at an average of 2.8 percent per year. 
Not surprisingly, with that kind of productivity growth, 
­everyone prospered. Real wage growth was strong, inflation 
was low, and living standards rose rapidly for most people.
This stretch of rapid productivity growth was also the ­period 
of government expansion described in Chapter 6. The 
­construction of the interstate highway system, the massive 
­program to put people on the moon, the creation of ­Medicare—
it’s no coincidence that these massive federal spending efforts 
came while productivity was growing quickly. With output per 
hour rising steadily, the economy was producing enough spare 
resources to expand government spending into new areas.
The era of rapid productivity growth ended around 1973. 
The immediate cause was the big jump in oil prices we 
­described earlier, which made energy a lot more expensive 
and hurt the transportation and utility industries. But even 
after businesses learned to cope with more expensive en-
ergy, the earlier rate of productivity growth did not return.
Economists suggested a variety of possible explanations 
for the productivity slowdown of 1973 to 1995. One theory 
FIGURE 9.9

United States experi-

1970s. Then, productiv-
ity growth slowed for 
roughly two decades, 
followed by a speed-up 
as businesses learned 
how to use information 
technology and global-
ization. Finally, in recent 
years, productivity 
growth has slowed, for 
as yet unexplained 
reasons.

was that as the baby boom generation entered the workforce, 
these workers were young, inexperienced, and not highly 
productive. Another theory was that the environmental regu-
lations passed in the late 1960s and early 1970s—such as the 
creation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970—
were dragging down growth. Yet another theory proposed 
that U.S. workers were not saving and investing enough, 
which was holding back productivity. And still another the-
ory suggested that there simply were not enough new prod-
ucts and innovation. Businesses were churning out the same 
old cars and washing machines.
All of these factors probably contributed to the productiv-
ity slowdown. But no matter which reason was the most im-
portant, the total impact was clear: From 1973 to 1995, 
productivity growth slowed to only 1.4 percent per year, 
which was roughly half the previous rate. This meant that 
real wage gains for many workers were much smaller or 
even nonexistent. It also meant that U.S. consumers, strapped 
for money, were much less willing to pay high tax rates.
This productivity slowdown lasted until around 1995, 
when two things happened more or less simultaneously. 
First, the information revolution finally kicked in. Busi-
nesses learned how to use computers to produce more output 
with fewer workers, even as the rise of the Internet helped tie 
all those computers together. At the same time, there was a 
great expansion of globalization as businesses learned how 
to use foreign suppliers to cut their costs (we’ll discuss 
­globalization more in Chapter 14).
Together, the combination of the information revolution 
and globalization propelled a new productivity boom. 
­Between 1995 and 2005, productivity growth rebounded to 
3.0 percent, almost to where it was during the Golden Age.
Unfortunately, that stretch of strong productivity growth 
did not last. Productivity growth started weakening after 
2005 and then slumped further in the 
years after the Great Recession. All 
told, productivity growth only averaged 
1.2 percent annually from 2005 to 2015. 
As of mid-2016, economists did not 
have a satisfactory explanation for this 
new productivity slowdown. Some saw 
it as merely a temporary pause. Other 
economists worried that the forces that 
had driven growth in the past—specifi-
cally, investment in physical capital, 
human capital, and knowledge—had 
run out of steam. Meanwhile, others 
pointed to the possibility that govern-
ment was overregulating the economy. 
Still, the fact remains: Unless pro-
ductivity growth picks up speed again, 
the U.S. economy will remain stuck in a rut. 
CONCLUSION
Economic growth is one of the most important things we 
can know about an economy. If we can measure how fast 
real GDP is rising, then we can tell whether the typical stan-
dard of living in the country is increasing. Rapid economic 
growth cannot be taken for granted—it depends on increas-
ing the inputs to the aggregate production function.
However, in any particular year, the economy may shrink 
rather than grow. That means economic growth is negative 
rather than positive, and it’s bad news for consumers and for 
businesses. As we will see in the next chapter and afterward, 
trying to avoid periods of negative economic growth—a 
shrinking economy—is one of the main goals of economic 
policymakers.

SUMMARY
	 1.	Economic growth leads to higher living standards. It 
also offers more choices. By pushing out the produc-
tion possibility frontier, economic growth increases 
the productive capabilities of an economy. (LO9-1)
	 2.	As we saw in Chapter 7, gross domestic product mea-
sures the output of an economy. Economic growth, or 
real GDP growth, is the increase in nominal GDP, 
­adjusted for inflation. (LO9-2)
	 3.	An increase in living standards can be measured by 
the increase in real GDP per capita, which is real GDP 
divided by the size of the population. In the United 
States, real GDP per capita has risen more or less 
steadily since the founding of the country. (LO9-3)
	 4.	Economic growth is driven by several factors, includ-
ing the number of workers, their education and skill, 
the amount of equipment and buildings, the availabil-
ity of raw materials, and the amount of knowledge. In-
creases in any of these can help propel growth on a 
macro level. (LO9-4)
	 5.	Government has an important role in promoting 
growth through laws and rules. However, there’s much 
disagreement about where to draw the line between 
government and the private sector. (LO9-5)
	 6.	Productivity is the average output per hour of work. 
Fast productivity growth is an indicator of the health 
and prosperity of an economy. (LO9-6)

closed down, the nation looked to econo-
mists to take a central role in setting gov-
ernment policy. They had to explain why 
the Depression happened, how it could 
be ended, and how the United States 
could prevent something similar from hap-
pening in the future.
	
Since the 1930s, there have been plenty 
of economic downturns or recessions in the 
United States and other industrialized coun-
tries. However, one of the great triumphs of 
modern economics is that no industrialized 
country has ever again suffered a depres-
sion of the same horrifying magnitude. Even 
the latest downturn, as bad as it was, was 
far less nasty than the Great Depression.
L
ife would be much easier if everything 
were predictable. We could plan a trip 
to the beach and know it wouldn’t rain. We 
could drive to work and pick the highway 
that didn’t leave us stuck in traffic for an 
hour behind a stalled truck. And best of all, 
in an ideal and stable world, we could be 
sure we’d never unexpectedly lose our job.
	
But as we have all learned, market econo-
mies are subject to distressing turbulence. 
During the Great Recession that started in 
2007, unemployment soared, millions of 
Americans lost their jobs and homes, banks 
were closed, and major companies such as 
General Motors were forced to declare 
bankruptcy. Some state and local govern-
ments had trouble paying their bills. The 
­crisis was worldwide, hitting Europe and 
­Japan as well as the United States. 
	
Over the years, economists have de-
voted enormous time and effort to under-
standing what causes economic fluctuations. 
In some ways, modern economics began 
with the Great Depression of the 1930s 
(described in Chapter 6), when production 
and employment plunged in a very short 
time—not just in the United States but 
around the world. With one out of every 
four workers jobless and many factories

In this chapter, we will look at the ups and downs 
of economies. We will show how an economy can 
deviate from a smooth upward path of potential 
gross domestic product (GDP). We will define unem-
ployment, one of the key measures of an economy’s 
health, and examine the balance between unem-
ployment and inflation. And we will look at reces-
sions: what they are, what kind of damage they can 
do, and what causes them. Then in the two chapters 
that follow, we will show how a government can use 
the tools of fiscal and monetary policy to help moder-
ate the swings of an economy.
POTENTIAL VERSUS  
REAL GDP  LO10-1 
Imagine you’re driving along a smooth highway, moving at the 
same speed as the other cars on the road, so there’s no pressure 
to speed up or slow down. You’re listening to music, talking 
with your friends in the car, and enjoying the ride. Life is good.
Or you could be driving like a maniac—
speeding up to 90 miles per hour to pass other 
cars, then suddenly jamming on the brakes just 
before you crash into the back of a truck or run 
into a pothole.
An economy is not a car, but it is useful to 
think about what it would mean for an economy 
to move along a smooth and sustainable path. If 
an economy is not jarred by outside shocks, if workers are fully 
employed but not overworked, if companies can sell every-
thing they make without strain, and if there are no sudden stops 
and starts, then output will ­generally rise smoothly over time. 
­Potential GDP is the output of an econ-
omy along this smooth path of growth, 
which assumes no strains on production 
or unused resources (a bit later in this 
chapter, we’ll explain more precisely 
what we mean by this). Potential GDP is 
measured in inflation-adjusted dollars 
like real GDP, and the rate at which it 
rises is the ­potential growth rate.
Potential Growth
The potential growth rate is driven by 
the factors we saw in the preceding 
chapter: growth of the labor force, 
availability of better-educated and more 
highly skilled workers, investments in 
physical capital, availability of raw ma-
terials, and increases in knowledge. We 
can also think of the potential growth 
rate over the long run as the combina-
tion of the long-term growth rate of the 
labor force and the long-term growth rate of 
productivity:
Potential growth rate = Long-term labor 
force growth rate + Long-term productivity 
growth rate
So if the labor force is growing at 1 percent 
per year, and productivity per worker is rising at 2 percent 
per year, then potential GDP (which is adjusted for inflation) 
is rising at 3 percent per year.
Estimating potential GDP is like drawing a line on a 
map to show where you are going. Economists project po-
tential GDP into the future to forecast the sustainable 
growth path for an economy. If we plot potential GDP on a 
graph (see Figure 10.1), it generally looks like a smooth line.
The Output Gap
But the real GDP of an economy need not follow the same 
smooth path as potential GDP at all. At any moment, real 
GDP may be higher or lower than potential GDP, just as a 
car may be moving faster or slower than the flow of traffic 
on a road. The output gap is the difference between real and 
potential GDP. The output gap is negative when real GDP is 
less than potential GDP, and it is positive when real GDP 
is greater than potential GDP (see Figure 10.2).
Real GDP can be lower than potential GDP if there are 
unused resources in the economy, such as workers who don’t 
have jobs, or workers who have jobs that don’t use their edu-
cation (like a PhD flipping hamburgers). Other unused 
­resources include idle machines and empty office buildings.
During the Great Recession year of 2009, the output gap 
was around 6 percent of GDP. This was a negative output 
gap—that is, real GDP was less than potential GDP.
FIGURE 10.1 The Path of Potential GDP
As time goes on, potential GDP rises smoothly, reflecting the 
growth of productivity and the growth of the labor force.

But it’s also possible for real output to exceed potential 
GDP. How? Imagine an economy consisting of five students. 
In theory, they can study at an even pace all semester. That 
would be the path of potential GDP. However, in reality, 
three of these students don’t work very hard—they wake up 
late and spend more time at parties than they do studying. In 
this economy, the actual output of work will fall short of 
potential, and the output gap will be negative.
Then comes the end of the semester. Suddenly, the 
three slackers pump themselves full of caffeine and stay 
up around the clock to finish their assignments and study 
for exams. The output gap is positive during this period 
because their output exceeds their potential. As a result, 
their output is very high, but it’s not sustainable. As we 
will see, there is a parallel between these students and the 
economy.
UNEMPLOYMENT  LO10-2 
When real GDP drops below potential GDP, it 
means economic activity has slowed. Compa-
nies lay off workers or just don’t hire. As a re-
sult, more workers become unemployed—that 
is, they don’t have jobs but are actively looking 
for work.
Unemployment is a key measure of the ups 
and downs of an economy. The Bureau of 
­Labor Statistics (BLS) ­estimates the number 
of unemployed workers each month based on 
a nationwide survey of 60,000 people of 
­various demographic characteristics. 
The BLS also estimates the number of 
employed workers each month. The 
labor force is the sum of the em-
ployed workers and the unemployed 
workers.
The unemployment rate is the per-
centage of the labor force that is unem-
ployed. Note that the unemployment 
rate doesn’t count people who are not 
looking for jobs because they have 
­become discouraged and given up. Nor 
does it count people who are not work-
ing because they are going to school, 
taking care of children, or simply goof-
ing off. Finally, the unemployment rate 
does not count the underemployed—
people who are working part-time 
­because they can’t find a full-time job 
or people who take jobs below their 
skill or education levels while they look 
for something better.
In April 2016, the unemployment 
rate was 5.0 percent, meaning that 
5.0 percent of the labor force did not 
have jobs.  With almost 160 million 
people in the U.S. labor force (as of April 
2016), a 5.0 percent unemployment rate 
translates into almost 8 million unemployed Americans.  
Figure 10.3 shows how the unemployment rate has varied 
since 1960. Over that stretch, the annual average unemploy-
ment rate has gone as high as 9.7 percent in 1982 and as low 
as 3.5 percent in 1969. Despite the severity of the Great 
­Recession, the annual unemployment rate hit only 9.3 per-
cent in 2009 and 9.6 percent in 2010. (These are the annual 
averages; in particular months, the unemployment rate may 
have been higher or lower.)
Types of Unemployment
As we saw in Chapter 3, markets typically tend toward an 
equilibrium in which the quantity supplied equals the quan-
tity demanded. If that were true in the labor market, every-
one would have a job who wanted one. But the unemployment 
rate never falls to zero in this way—not in the 
United States or in any other country.
Economists have long puzzled over this fact 
and have come up with a variety of explanations. 
One reason unemployment is never zero is that 
the unemployment rate includes frictional 
­unemployment—periods of temporary unem-
ployment that correspond to short gaps between 
jobs. Frictional unemployment arises because 
there are usually at least a couple of weeks 
­between the end of one job and the beginning of 
FIGURE 10.2 Potential versus Real GDP
The output gap measures the difference between potential 
and real GDP. When real GDP is greater than potential GDP, 
the output gap is positive. When real GDP is less than potential 
GDP, the output gap is negative.

the next one or between graduating from 
school and finding your first job. Even 
in the tightest labor market—or maybe 
especially in a tight labor market—peo-
ple who are searching for work may ac-
tually turn some jobs down in hopes of 
getting a better one. This type of unem-
ployment is also considered frictional 
unemployment.
Another reason unemployment per-
sists is structural unemployment. 
Structural unemployment occurs when 
there is a mismatch between the skills 
of unemployed workers and the needs 
of employers with unfilled jobs. For ex-
ample, if a local factory is closing, the 
laid-off workers are probably not imme-
diately qualified to take jobs as nurses 
even if the local hospital is hiring. The 
faster the economy changes, the more 
structural unemployment there will be.
But frictional and structural unemployment do not fully 
explain some of the big swings we see in the unemployment 
rate. Especially striking are the big jumps upward in some 
years, which we call cyclical unemployment—large jumps 
in unemployment tied directly to slowdowns in economic 
growth. For example, in Figure 10.3 we see the annual un-
employment rate remained above 6 percent for six years, 
from 2009 to 2014. 
The Unemployment Puzzle
In general, when the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity 
demanded in a market, the price falls. In the labor market, 
the price is the wage. So the unemployment ­puzzle is really 
a wage puzzle: When the unemployment rate is high, why 
doesn’t the wage drop? One possible answer is sticky wages. 
That is, wages are sticky when they don’t change much in 
the short-term in response to economic conditions. For one 
thing, workers might not want to accept wage cuts in peri-
ods of high unemployment because they expect the labor 
market to quickly recover. In Figure 10.3, we see that the

Sometimes, a milestone is negative; the biggest one-year loss in private-sector jobs 
since the Great Depression came in 2009. In that year, private businesses reduced 
their employment by almost 6 million jobs. Roughly 1.6 million of those cuts came from 
manufacturing and another 1.1 million were in construction.
	
What’s more, these were not temporary layoffs: Many of those jobs were gone  
for good because companies permanently closed factories and moved production 
overseas. The result was an increase in structural unemployment.

case? As actual GDP rises above poten-
tial GDP, economic activity increases 
and unemployment falls. That’s good. 
But the problem with increased eco-
nomic activity is that inflation can rise; 
that is, prices and wages can start 
­increasing at a faster rate.
Why should high GDP and low 
­unemployment be linked to rising in-
flation? Here’s one way to think about this: If the number 
of unemployed workers is low, it’s harder for employers to 
find people to fill job openings. As a result, workers feel 
they have more power to ask for wage increases. Those 
wage increases drive up costs for companies and force 
them to raise prices. The higher prices eat away at the 
value of wages, and workers have to demand even bigger 
wage increases to keep up with inflation. The result is the 
sort of wage–price spiral described in Chapter 8.
In other words, if an economy runs too “hot”—that is, if 
GDP is too high relative to potential GDP—we get rising 
inflation. If an economy runs too “cold”—if GDP is too low 
relative to potential GDP—we get unemployment. As we 
will see in Chapters 11 and 12, one of the most important 
tasks for economic policymakers such as the chair of the 
Federal Reserve is to find the right balance between infla-
tion and unemployment.
Inflation and Potential GDP
Earlier in this section, we gave a basic description of poten-
tial GDP. Now that we have seen the link among inflation, 
GDP, and unemployment, here is a more precise definition:
Potential GDP = The maximum economic output 
an economy can sustain without increasing the 
inflation rate
When the economy is operating at potential, the rate of 
inflation is neither rising nor falling. This level of potential 
GDP is the point at which the forces of supply 
and demand are well balanced, given the 
­existing labor force, technology, and stock of 
capital. That is why the potential growth rate 
is sometimes called the speed limit of the 
economy. If actual growth exceeds potential 
growth for too long, the economy overheats 
and inflation rises.
The unemployment number that’s usually quoted is the 
unemployment rate for the entire country. But the 
­Bureau of Labor Statistics also publishes the unemploy-
ment rates for many local areas. These give the 
percentages of the local labor force who are out of 
work and looking for a job.
	
Some areas have unemployment rates that are 
much lower than the national average. For example, in 
October 2015, the unemployment rate in Bismarck, 
North Dakota, was only 1.7 percent. Bismarck has a re-
cession-resistant economy because it is the state capi-
tal of North Dakota and because of the oil boom.
	
In contrast, El Centro, California, a poor metropolitan 
area near the border with Mexico, had an unemploy-
ment rate in excess of 20 percent from 2008 through 
the beginning of 2016. El Centro didn’t lose that many 
jobs in the recession, but its labor force kept growing, 
sending unemployment higher.

gov/news.release/pdf/metro.pdf).

HOW IT WORKS: LOCAL 
UNEMPLOYMENT
unemployment rate often goes up and then does, in fact, come 
down within a couple of years. Another reason for sticky 
wages is that roughly 11 percent of the workforce belongs to 
unions, which are organized groups of workers that bargain 
collectively with employers. The contracts set the wages for 
the workers, making them harder to cut if things turn down. 
(We will further discuss labor markets in Chapter 16.)

UNEMPLOYMENT AND  
INFLATION  LO10-3

falls below potential GDP and more people end 
up without jobs. But what about the opposite

Business Cycles, Unemployment, and Inflation
The Natural Rate of 
Unemployment
We can watch the unemployment rate 
to see whether ­economic output is ap-
proaching a level that causes inflation 
to accelerate. Milton Friedman, a Uni-
versity of Chicago economist who 
won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 
1976, defined the natural rate of 
­unemployment as the level at which 
inflation is more or less stable. When 
the unemployment rate is below the 
natural rate, inflation tends to increase, 
and when the unemployment rate is 
above the natural rate, inflation tends 
to fall. Another, rather long name for 
the natural rate of unemployment is the 
nonaccelerating inflation rate of un-
employment, or NAIRU for short.
The NAIRU, or natural rate, is a key 
indicator of how hot an economy can 
run without pushing up inflation. As of 
late 2015, the NAIRU was 5.0 percent, 
as estimated by the Congressional 
­Budget Office.
For example, in 1983, the NAIRU 
was about 6 percent and the actual un-
employment rate was 9.6 percent. With 
so many people out of work and cutting 
back on their spending, demand was 
weak and businesses found it difficult 
to raise prices. In fact, the inflation rate 
fell sharply in 1983.
On the other hand, in 2000 the ac-
tual unemployment rate was 4 percent, 
lower than the NAIRU, which was 
about 5 percent. With lots of people 
employed and spending their wages, 
demand was strong and businesses were able to raise prices. 
As a result, the inflation rate rose in 2000.
When the unemployment rate is at or near the NAIRU, 
then it is likely that the economy is operating at potential. 
That’s one reason the unemployment rate is such a closely 
watched economic number.
RECESSIONS  LO10-4 
Small deviations of real GDP from potential 
GDP or of the unemployment rate from the 
NAIRU don’t matter much—just as you can drive 
slightly faster or slower than the flow of traffic on 
a highway without causing any big problems.
But large deviations from the potential growth 
path—especially deviations downward—are a 
problem. Think about what happens if your car stalls in the 
middle of a busy highway. Similarly, if GDP is running 
­below its potential, everything in the economy suffers. It’s 
harder to find a job, profits aren’t as high, malls are empty, 
and tax revenues fall short of predictions. The world is a 
gloomier place.
If a downward deviation from potential growth becomes 
bad enough, an economy can actually shrink. A recession is 
defined as a significant decline in economic activity spread 
across an economy, lasting more than a few months. (Who 
identifies the official date when a recession starts? See 
“How it Works: Calling the Recession.”)
The Business Cycle
Although all recessions are different, all display similar pat-
terns. The peak is the date on which a recession starts—
that’s when the economy hits a high point and starts heading 
downward. The date on which the recession ends and the 
economy starts heading up again is called the trough. The 
expansion is the time from the trough, through recovery, and 
all the way to the next peak. This pattern of recession and 
expansion is known as the business cycle; see 
Figure 10.4 for a closer look at a typical cycle.
Despite its unusual severity, the Great 
­Recession shows the same basic pattern as past 
downturns. The Great Recession officially 
started in December 2007, even though hous-
ing prices started dropping as early as 2006. 
The recession officially ended in June 2009, 18 
months after it started, making it the longest, 
nastiest downturn since the Great Depression.

is a decline in the nation’s economic activity significant 
enough to qualify for this official designation? Oddly, 
government statisticians do not make this decision. In-
stead a private research group—the National Bureau of 
Economic Research (NBER)—decides the official dates 
on which a recession starts and ends.
	
The NBER is a Cambridge, Massachusetts–based or-
ganization that was founded in the 1920s to study the 
ups and downs of business cycles. Today, whenever 
there is an economic downturn, the Business Cycle 
Dating Committee of the NBER—made up of several 
prominent economists—meets to decide the official 
­beginning and end dates of a recession, based on key 
figures like employment and retail sales.

Figure 10.5 tracks real GDP through the recession, with 
the peak in the fourth quarter of 2007. The graph shows us 
that the initial stages of the downturn were fairly mild. But 
after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in mid-September 
2008, the U.S. economy went into a steep plunge.
As we will see in the next two chapters, this was the 
­period when the Federal Reserve, under Chairman Ben 
­Bernanke, and the federal government, under President 
George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, took unprec-
edented monetary and fiscal policy measures to prop up the 
economy. During this stretch, there was widespread concern 
that even enormous government intervention was not going 
to be enough.
However, Figure 10.5 shows us that the government 
­actions eventually seemed to be effective in stopping the 
plunge. The low point for real GDP came in the second 
quarter of 2009. We can see that real GDP, a measure of 
the output of the economy, did not exceed its previous peak 
until 2011.
The Impact of Recession on Workers
Who suffers the most from a recession? Without question, 
unemployed workers and their families suffer the most pain, 
especially those who do not have a savings cushion. From 
economic, political, and human points of view, a lengthy and 
deep recession can be a major disaster for individuals who 
lose their jobs.
The reason is simple: During a recession, if you lose your 
job, it’s hard to find a new one. As the economy shrinks, 
factories close and companies stop hiring. And even after a 
recession is over, it can take months or years for the labor 
market to revive. As a result, people who lose their jobs in 
recessions can find themselves unemployed for months or 
even years. That’s long enough to outlast their savings and 
their ability to hold onto their homes (see Figure 10.6).

The Impact of Recession on Businesses
Recessions hurt businesses as well as workers. As an econ-
omy slows, the demand schedules of most businesses shift to 
the left. For the same price, the quantity demanded falls, and 
therefore the quantity supplied also falls.
Figure 10.7 shows the supply and demand schedules for a 
typical market in an economy—say, for cars. During a reces-
sion, consumers have less money to spend on new cars, and 
that causes the demand schedule to shift to the left. As a result, 
production of cars falls from Q to Q′. The auto companies are

SPOTLIGHT: RECESSION-RESISTANT INDUSTRIES
In any recession, a few sectors usually avoid the general 
downturn and keep expanding. For example, entertain-
ment spending is somewhat ­recession-resistant because 
people want to have fun to take their minds off their 
­economic problems. Movie ticket sales held up well during 
the recession years of 2008 and 2009, spurred by the 
­release of films such as The Dark Knight (though ticket 
sales did fall off in 2010, when the top-grossing film 
was the less-than-stellar Toy Story 3).
	
Another recession-resistant industry is health care. Peo-
ple keep ­getting sick whether the economy is up or down. 
Moreover, much of health care spending is funded by the 
federal government, which can keep spending even in a 
downturn by borrowing money.
	
As a result, health care employment typically keeps in-
creasing even when other parts of the economy are 
shrinking. From December 2007 to December 2010, for 
example, hospitals, physicians’ offices, and other health 
care businesses added roughly 800,000 jobs, while the 
rest of the private sector lost 7.5 million jobs.

forced to offer discounts and special deals, so 
the price falls from P to P′. In fact, this is ex-
actly what happened in the Great Recession. 
Motor vehicle sales collapsed to the point 
where General Motors and Chrysler were 
forced to declare bankruptcy and accept bail-
outs from the federal government.
But companies don’t simply cut back on current produc-
tion. In fact, all sorts of businesses—big banks, the mom-
and-pop store at the corner—also cut back sharply on 
expansion and their plans for upgrades in recessions. Any 
spending they can postpone, they will.
That’s why recessions are usually accompanied by a rapid 
drop in purchases of capital equipment, such as machinery 
and computers, and an equally noticeable decline in the con-
struction of commercial office buildings, factories, and other 
nonresidential structures.
In fact, an essential characteristic of a recession is that it 
is broad based, so that the slowdown is spread across most 
of the economy. Table 10.1 lists some of the typical areas 
that are hit by recessions, including home construction and 
business profits. True, some industries tend to hold up 
­better than others in recessions (see “Spotlight: Recession-­
Resistant Industries”). Nevertheless, these are the exception, 
not the rule.
WHY DO RECESSIONS  
HAPPEN?  LO10-5 
If you see a car broken down by the side of the road, you 
don’t know what happened. It could be that the driver was 
unlucky and hit a bad pothole. Or perhaps the 
driver neglected essential maintenance and the 
vehicle overheated. Or maybe the car simply 
ran out of gas.
We face the same uncertainty when it comes 
to recessions. An economy may stall for a num-
ber of different reasons. The question of what 
causes recessions is one of the longest-running 
FIGURE 10.7

debates among economists, going back to the Great Depression. 
For our purposes here, we just need to realize that recessions 
can have different triggers, as Table 10.2 shows. Let’s look at 
some of these: problems in financial markets, negative supply 
shifts, negative ­demand shifts, and inflation fighting.
Problems in Financial Markets
Recessions caused by a financial crisis are rare but challeng-
ing. Financial markets let individuals and businesses borrow 
money to finance everything from homes and cars to college 
educations. When financial markets stop working well, it 
­becomes harder to borrow. When it becomes harder to bor-
row, the economy slows.
The Great Recession was caused, in large part, by prob-
lems in financial markets. As we’ll see in Chapter 13, many 
consumers borrowed more than they should have, especially 
to buy homes. In particular, low-income homebuyers 
­borrowed more than they could afford to pay back—the 
­so-called subprime loans. And many banks lent more than 
they should have, helping fuel the housing boom.
But, eventually, the boom came to an end and was 
­followed by a bust. Several big Wall Street firms either failed 
or were forced to sell themselves. Many homebuyers could 
not pay their mortgages.
After the bust, most banks tightened up their lending 
standards. As it became harder for consumers to borrow, 
there was less money available to buy homes and cars. It 
became harder for small businesses to raise the money they 
needed to operate and expand. The result was a sharp slow-
down in the economy.
Negative Supply Shifts
Another significant cause of recessions is an unexpected 
negative supply shift, which moves the supply curve to the 
left for a broad array of markets. The classic example of 
such a negative shock is a sudden rise in the price of oil. For

The Impact of a Negative 
Supply Shift
A rise in the price of oil can increase transportation costs for 
groceries and cause a shift in the supply curve to the left. 
That, in turn, reduces the quantity demanded and supplied. If 
this affects enough markets, it can cause overall economic 
output to decline.

example, the 1973 oil price shock, described in Chapter 6, 
helped trigger the recession of 1973–1975. Similarly, Sad-
dam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which pushed oil 
prices up, was one of the main reasons the U.S. economy 
slipped into recession that year. And the oil price increase of 
2007 and 2008 helped slow the U.S. economy going into the 
early stages of the Great Recession.
An oil price increase is particularly harmful because it is 
a broad supply shift that affects most markets in an econ-
omy. By making energy and transportation more costly, the

higher price of oil causes the supply schedule in many indi-
vidual markets to shift left.
Consider, for example, the market for grocery items. 
These items are shipped to supermarkets from all over the 
country, so an increase in the cost of fuel translates directly 
into rising costs for supermarkets. As Figure 10.8 shows, a 
negative supply shift in a market tends to decrease the quan-
tity demanded and increase the price.
If the higher price of oil affected only the grocery market, 
that would not cause a recession by itself. After all, grocery 
purchases, even though they account for billions of dollars 
of sales each year, are just a small part of the economy.
To cause a recession, a negative shift has to affect many 
markets simultaneously. In that case, it can decrease the out-
put of the whole economy and push up inflation. That’s ex-
actly what happened after the oil price shock of 1973: The 
economy went into a combination of recession and inflation 
called stagflation. In every market where energy was an im-
portant cost, the supply curve shifted to the left—including 
the labor market because higher gasoline prices made com-
muting more expensive for most people.
Another example of a negative supply shift is a terrorist 
attack that forces businesses and governments to adopt 
tighter security measures. For example, suppose every box 
and container imported into the United States had to be 
checked for bombs. Such measures would make both ship-
ping and transportation more expensive. The result would 
be a leftward shift in supply schedules over a broad range 
of markets, with the resulting fall in quantity and increase 
in prices that precipitate a recession. (To see an example 
of a narrow supply shift, take a look at “Spotlight: Do 
Hurricanes Cause Recessions?”)
Negative Demand Shifts
A sudden and unexpected drop in demand can also cause a 
recession. Possibly the best example of a recession driven by 
a negative demand shift was the recession of 2001, which 
was caused primarily by a decline in business spending on 
computers, communications equipment, and other informa-
tion technology gear. Until 2000, companies’ spending on 
computers and information technology had been soaring for 
several different reasons. First, the dawning of the Internet 
age had created a surge of start-up dot-com companies, all of 
which had to spend heavily on computer equipment to get 
their operations up and running.
Second, businesses were scared of the “Y2K bug,” which 
was the threat that older computer systems and programs 
would crash when the clock turned to January 1, 2000. As a 
result, many companies spent large sums of money replacing 
their old computers and programs. Third, telecom compa-
nies were spending billions laying down new fiber-optic 
­cable to handle all the future online traffic they expected.
But these sources of demand evaporated. Most dot-com 
companies failed. January 1, 2000, came and went (without a 
major hitch, as it turned out), and the need to fix the Y2K 
problem was over. And it turned out that the telecom compa-
nies had overspent because Internet traffic did not rise as fast 
as they expected (though Internet traffic did eventually soar). 
So businesses, which spent $225 billon on computers and 
communications equipment in 2000, cut back sharply in 
2001 and kept cutting. By 2003, their spending on informa-
tion technology hardware was down to $160 billion.
This decline in demand helped trigger widespread lay-
offs. The unemployment rate in the San Jose, California, 
area—where major Silicon Valley tech companies such as 
Sun and Cisco are based—jumped from 2.5 percent in 2000 
to 8.5 percent just two years later. Worldcom, a major tele-
phone and Internet provider, went bankrupt in 2002, along 
with a host of smaller companies. All told, the “tech bust,” 
as it was called, led to the 2001 recession. It was not a 
lengthy recession—only eight months—but it took a long 
time for jobs to recover.
We can imagine other scenarios for a recession driven by 
a decline in demand. For example, a deadly flu epidemic that 
kept people from shopping would reduce demand sharply, 
though it would probably also cut supply because many 
workplaces would close down as employees became ill.
Inflation Fighting
Let’s come now to the final important cause of the reces-
sion: inflation fighting. If you run too fast and get over-
heated, you have to slow down for a while to catch your 
SPOTLIGHT: DO HURRICANES 
CAUSE RECESSIONS?
Can a natural disaster such as a hurricane or an earth-
quake cause a recession? Perhaps, but history sug-
gests that it is not likely in the United States. The worst 
recent natural disaster to hit the United States was 
­Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which almost completely 
flooded New Orleans and much of the Mississippi 
coast. The storm caused at least $40 billion in losses 
and perhaps a lot more. At the same time, damage to 
the oil wells and refineries along the Gulf Coast drove 
gasoline prices up across the country.
	
But despite the devastation in New Orleans, GDP 
growth for the United States barely slowed in the third 
and fourth quarters of 2005. There are several reasons 
for the lack of overall economic impact. First, New 
­Orleans, ­although a major city, contributed only a relatively 
small share to the whole U.S. economy. Second, many 
businesses with operations in New Orleans were able to 
move their production to other parts of the country. And 
third, the rebuilding effort, which included billions for re-
pairing and upgrading dikes and levees, actually added  
to the level of economic activity in the United States.

breath. Sometimes, the economy gets into a similar situa-
tion: If output runs above potential for too long, the econ-
omy overheats and inflation rises, as discussed earlier. When 
that happens, economic policymakers at the Federal 
­Reserve—the country’s central bank—have to take inflation-
fighting steps to slow growth. Sometimes, they slow growth 
so much that the result is a recession.
For example, in 1980 and 1981, the inflation rate was 
running at 13.5 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively. That 
was way too high. So Paul Volcker, who was chairman of the 
Federal Reserve at that point, applied the brakes. To bring 
down inflation, he needed to get the unemployment rate 
above the NAIRU—which was about 6 percent at the time. 
That is, he had to intentionally force unemployment way up 
to reduce inflation.
That’s exactly what Volcker did. He raised interest rates 
so high that businesses and consumers pulled back from bor-
rowing. Purchases of homes and cars plunged, and the un-
employment rate skyrocketed. He achieved his goal of 
reducing inflation—but the result was a deep recession that 
put millions of people out of work.
We have not had a recession caused by inflation fighting 
since 1981–1982. But if prices start to increase at a rapid 
rate, the Federal Reserve could very well raise interest rates 
to slow the economy.
CONCLUSION
Market economies don’t always grow at a steady rate. Some-
times, they grow too fast for a period, creating the conditions 
in which inflation can get out of control. Other times, market 
economies shrink, turning into the unpleasant stretch that 
economists call a recession.
The ups and downs of economies described in this chap-
ter will never go away. But they can be made less harmful 
by appropriate policy responses, as we will see in the next 
two chapters.

SUMMARY
	 1.	Potential GDP is the output of an economy along a 
smooth path of growth, which assumes no strains on 
the economy or unused resources. Real GDP can be 
higher or lower than potential GDP. The difference 
­between the two is known as the output gap. (LO10-1)
	 2.	When real GDP drops below potential GDP, businesses 
cut back on hiring. The result is a rise in the unemploy-
ment rate—the percentage of the workforce that wants 
to work but cannot find jobs. Three types of unemploy-
ment are frictional, structural, and cyclical. (LO10-2)
	 3.	If the unemployment rate rises above the natural 
rate of unemployment—also called the NAIRU—the 
­inflation rate falls. If the unemployment rate drops be-
low the NAIRU, the inflation rate rises. (LO10-3)
	 4.	A recession is a significant decline in economic activ-
ity spread across an economy, lasting more than a 
few months. The beginning of a recession is called 
the peak, and the end of a recession is the trough. 
Recessions can hurt both workers and businesses. 
(LO10-4)
	 5.	Recessions can have several different causes. These 
include problems in financial markets, negative supply 
shifts, negative demand shifts, and inflation fighting.

of individuals and com-
panies that donated 
money to campaigns.
	
But leaving politics 
aside, reputable econo-
mists disagree about the 
right way to run fiscal policy. Some favor a 
larger role for the government, especially 
when the economy is in a slump. Others ar-
gue for shrinking government spending and 
taxation because they prefer less govern-
ment interference and oversight. And a third 
group of economists focuses on reducing 
the size of the budget deficit, which is the 
difference between spending and revenue.
	
In this chapter, we will lay out the basics 
of fiscal policy. We will discuss both the 
positive and negative impacts of govern-
ment spending, taxes, and borrowing on 
the rest of the economy, presenting the 
different perspectives in an unbiased 
fashion. We will end this chapter by exam-
ining long-term fiscal policy.
I
n 2008 and 2009, the federal government 
used its financial muscle to combat the 
Great Recession. President George W. Bush 
signed a bill to help prop up the failing bank-
ing system, and President Barack Obama 
followed with legislation that pumped $787 
billion worth of federal spending and tax 
cuts into the faltering economy. 
	
These increases in federal spending 
and cuts in taxes helped prevent the Great 
Recession from turning into something 
worse. But it also left the United States 
with a huge budget deficit as spending far 
exceeded tax revenues.
	
In this chapter, we will analyze the eco-
nomic effects of fiscal policy—that is, de-
cisions about government spending, 
taxes, and debt in both the short run and 
the long run. In the short term, fiscal policy 
consists of the government’s budget deci-
sions that affect employment, output, and 
inflation over the next couple of years. 
That includes the spending increases and 
tax cuts that the government enacted to 
fight the Great Recession. In the long 
term, fiscal policy creates the link between 
government spending and taxation deci-
sions and the country’s economic growth.
	
Fiscal policy is probably the most politi-
cally charged area of economics. Each year, 
lawmakers and government officials in 
Washington decide how to allocate trillions 
of dollars. The result is a federal budget 
hundreds of pages long in which every sen-
tence can make a big impact on someone’s 
life or company. And of course, members of 
Congress get elected in part because of 
their ability to influence the budget in favor

THE GOVERNMENT AND 
THE ECONOMY  LO11-1 
Imagine an armored car filled with a million 
dollars, making a pickup from a local bank. 
Now imagine a fleet of 3.9 million armored 
cars, each with a million dollars in it. That’s 
what you would need to carry the $3.9 trillion 
the federal government spent in 2015.
If we add in the spending of state and local governments, 
the total would be even higher. In 2015, government at all 
levels—federal, state, and local—spent almost $6 trillion. 
Of that amount, $2.6 trillion paid for 
the salaries of government workers and 
for goods and services provided to the 
government. This is what we called 
“government output” in Chapter 7. 
­Another $600 billion went for interest 
payments on government, while the re-
maining $2.7 trillion went to transfer 
payments—government payments to 
individuals such as Social Security, 
Medicare, welfare, and other payments 
such as subsidies to businesses. In 
other words, one of government’s most 
important roles is to act as a pipeline, shifting 
money from some people to others.
In many ways, a dollar spent by the govern-
ment contributes as much to economic output as 
a dollar spent in the private sector. Paying a 
schoolteacher’s salary, fixing a bridge, or pro-
viding medical care for the elderly can be just as 
important—or perhaps even more important—
to the economy than your neighbor’s purchasing an expen-
sive sports car.
However, there is a big difference between government 
and the private sector. In the private sector, businesses and 
individuals collect and spend money by means of market 
transactions. They exchange money either for goods and ser-
vices, in the case of businesses and their customers, or for 
labor, in the case of workers and employers. All transactions 
are voluntary, so presumably all parties benefit.
What’s more, as we saw in Chapter 5, private businesses 
are always under pressure to cut costs and find ways to 
­become more efficient. If they don’t do that, they are at risk 
of being put out of business by competitors.
Governments, in contrast, are under no such economic 
pressure to be efficient and innovative. Nobody is going to 
put the federal government out of business or take away its 
customers. Instead, the level of government spending is set 
by the political system rather than the economic system, and 
that spending is funded through a combination of taxation 
and borrowing. Taxation, the main way the government 
raises money, is a legally required transfer of funds from in-
dividuals and businesses to the government. Governments 
also raise money by borrowing. Like private borrowers, 
­governments have to pay interest on their debts. But unlike 
private borrowers, they can pay back their debts by raising 
taxes if necessary. For these reasons, the government has a 
special role in the economy.
THE SHORT-TERM IMPACT OF 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING  LO11-2 
Each year, the federal budget is set through a complicated and 
exhausting process beginning in February, when the president 
proposes a budget for the next fiscal year (which starts on 
­October 1 of each year). For the next nine months, various 
congressional committees and the executive branch wrangle 
over everything from the overall level of spending down to the 
smallest details, such as the funding for the ­Marine Mammal 
Commission (total 2015 budget: $3.3 million). Eventually, 
Congress and the president agree on how much is to be spent 
and what the tax rules will be.
What’s important here is that the level of spending is set 
through the political system. Congress and the president can 
decide to either increase or decrease government spending.
When Congress and the president decide to boost or cut 
federal spending, what happens to the rest of the economy? 
In this chapter, we talk about government as if it were 
one big entity. But there are three separate levels of 
government, each of which has different patterns of 
spending and taxation. The federal government, based 
in Washington, DC, spends mostly on national defense, 
Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.
	
In contrast, the 50 state governments and the 
more than 30,000 county and municipal governments 
have different sets of priorities. Their big expenses 
are education and local services such as police, fire 
protection, and waste collection. State governments 
also pay quite a bit toward Medicaid—the medical 
care for the poor.
	
Take the city of Springfield, Massachusetts, which 
has a population of 150,000 and is also home of the 
Basketball Hall of Fame (which, naturally, is shaped a  
bit like a basketball). In 2015, the city had a budget of 
$582 million. Out of that, 63.5 percent was spent on 
education and 10.7 percent on public safety (police 
and fire). This is a very different spending pattern from 
that of the federal government.

To make this more concrete, let’s say they 
choose to boost spending by allocating an extra 
$10 million dollars for repairing a bridge that is 
about to collapse. We’ll ignore for the moment 
the important question of where the added 
$10 million comes from (though we’ll see later 
in the chapter that this makes a big difference 
to the economy).
The government spends some of the money 
on labor: architects and engineers to draw up the 
plans, truck drivers to move the supplies, con-
struction workers to assemble the parts, police 
officers to supervise the site. It spends some 
money on equipment: cranes, drilling equipment, trucks. 
Other money goes for materials: steel, concrete, paint.
As you can see, repairing the bridge creates more demand 
for labor, materials, and equipment. In other words, the de-
mand schedule for labor and the demand schedule for con-
struction materials and equipment both shift to the right, as 
we see in Figures 11.1 and 11.2.
The effect of the increase in government spending is to 
push up the quantity of labor from L to L′ and to push up the 
quantity of construction materials from Q to Q′. In other 
words, unemployment falls because more workers are em-
ployed. And production increases because more construc-
tion materials are being demanded and supplied.
This brings us to the following general principle: In the 
short term, an increase in government spending lowers un-
employment and increases GDP, all other things being equal. 
This principle is the essence of the Keynesian approach to 
macroeconomics, which uses increases in gov-
ernment spending and cuts in taxes (as we will 
see later in this chapter) to combat the effect of 
recessions. Such increases in government 
spending and cuts in taxes are called fiscal 
stimulus because they involve changes in fiscal 
policy. Economist John Maynard Keynes origi-
nally proposed the use of government spending 
to stimulate the economy in the 1930s during 
the Great Depression. He argued that the reason 
for the steep decline in GDP during the Depres-
sion was the lack of demand—a problem the 
government could correct by spending more.
Since then, economists have had long and complex 
­disputes about the validity of the 
Keynesian approach. Over time, they 
have come to better understand many 
of its limitations, which we will dis-
cuss later in this chapter. However, fac-
ing a worsening recession in late 2008 
and early 2009, most economists 
agreed that it was important for the 
government to support demand. The 
American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act (ARRA) signed by President 
Obama in February 2009 was intended 
to stimulate growth and job creation by 
boosting demand (see Table 11.1).

Spending on the Labor Market

The Multiplier Effect
Now let’s continue our story of repairing the bridge. With 
more workers employed, the demand for consumer products 
goes up. Workers now have money to buy necessities like 
food, consumer durables like cars, and luxuries like occa-
sional dinners out. That boosts spending, which increases 
sales across the whole range of businesses, including gro-
cery stores, auto dealers, and restaurants.
Think about auto dealers, for example. Remember, the 
government itself doesn’t buy any extra cars because it’s re-
pairing the bridge, but the newly hired construction workers 
do. If the government hires 1,000 construction workers, and 
100 of them buy new cars with their 
paychecks, that’s 100 cars that weren’t 
sold before.
The rise in sales across the board en-
courages private-sector businesses to 
hire more workers as well: more car 
sales staff, more supermarket checkout 
clerks, more restaurant cooks. What’s 
more, if sales go up enough, the auto 
dealers may be tempted to add another 
building to accommodate the new de-
mand. And guess what? The construc-
tion company that builds the new auto 
dealership probably has to hire new 
workers too.
In other words, the initial government 
hiring effort creates enough additional 
purchasing power in the economy to induce another round of 
hiring in the private sector. And those extra workers, in turn, 
boost the economy with their purchases as well.
Taken together, this multiplier effect is the short-term 
boost in economic activity that flows from the government’s 
spending increase (or tax cut, as we will see later in the 
chapter). A similar multiplier effect occurs for any type of 
government spending. For example, giving food stamps to 
poor households raises the demand for food, leading grocery 
stores to hire more cashiers. A purchase order for military 
submarines increases employment at the shipyards that 
keeps local stores humming, boosts construction of new 
homes for the shipyard workers, and perhaps even increases 
jobs at beach resorts as the workers can afford more family 
vacations.
We can state the multiplier as a job multiplier, which 
gives the total number of jobs created by one additional gov-
ernment-funded job. A job multiplier of 2 means that each 
new government job creates one new private-sector job. A 
job multiplier of 1 means no additional private-sector jobs 
are created.
Alternatively, we can state the multiplier as a spending 
multiplier, which gives the increase in GDP created by one 
additional dollar of government expenditures. Suppose the 
government spends an additional dollar on hiring workers or 
buying supplies. By itself that would boost GDP by $1 
­because government spending on goods and services is one 
component of GDP (as we saw in Chapter 7). But that dollar 
could have an additional effect as that new worker uses the

new income to increase his purchases. A spending multiplier 
of 1.4 means that GDP goes up by $1.40 in response to the 
initial spending increase: $1 from the bigger government 
component and $0.40 extra in the private sector.
To put things in a wider perspective, suppose the govern-
ment boosts spending by $100 billion. If the spending multi-
plier is 1.4, GDP will rise by $140 billion, including both the 
initial spending and its follow-up effects. That seems like a 
lot of money. However, with national GDP in early 2016 
running at about $18 trillion per year, a $140 billion increase 
is equivalent to only about a 0.8 percent increase in GDP 
(0.8 percent = $140 billion/$18 trillion).
Economists use the multiplier to help estimate the impact 
of fiscal stimulus (see “Spotlight: The Impact of ARRA”). 
The multiplier can work at either the national or the local 
level. One of the best examples of the multiplier effect on 
the local level plays out in Washington, DC. The main em-
ployer in the District of Columbia is, of course, the federal 
government, which accounts for about 30 percent of all the 
area’s workers. In fact, if it weren’t for the federal govern-
ment, most private-sector businesses in Washington 
wouldn’t be there, including many law firms and trade asso-
ciations that lobby legislators and regulators. Without the 
government and the multiplier effect, Washington might be 
a small and sleepy village.
The Marginal Propensity to Consume
What determines the size of the multiplier? One factor is the 
marginal propensity to consume (MPC), which is the por-
tion that households spend of each additional dollar they re-
ceive. Think about a construction worker being hired to build 
the bridge. When she gets the pay from her new job, she has 
the choice to spend the money or put it in the bank. If her 
marginal propensity to consume is .6, she’ll spend 60 cents of 
that additional dollar and save the remaining 40 cents.
The higher the marginal propensity to consume, the 
bigger the multiplier will be, all other things being equal. 
If those newly hired construction workers run right out 
and buy cars, they’ll give a big boost to the rest of the 
economy. More autoworkers will be hired, who in turn 
will go out and spend their wages on renovating their 
homes, say. That will lift the employment of carpenters, 
and so forth.
But if the newly hired construction workers sock all 
their money away in the bank, the short-term boost to the 
economy will be much smaller. Car sales won’t go up, ex-
tra autoworkers won’t be hired, and employment won’t 
rise as much.
At one end of the scale, poor individuals typically have a 
marginal propensity to consume of close to 1. They are gen-
erally short of money for necessities. So, given an extra dol-
lar, they are forced to spend it all (a survey by the Federal 
Reserve suggests that only about one-third of low-income 
households do any saving).
In contrast, the richest individuals don’t spend all their 
income, so if you give them an extra dollar, it’s not likely to 
affect their spending habits much. ­Indeed, if you give Mark 
Zuckerberg of Facebook an extra $100, he’s not likely to go 
on a buying spree. As a result, the rich 
have a very low marginal propensity to 
consume—perhaps close to zero.
The implication? The multiplier is 
higher if government spending goes, di-
rectly or indirectly, to people with a high 
marginal propensity to consume. A gov-
ernment project that hires unemployed 
SPOTLIGHT: THE IMPACT  
OF ARRA
From the beginning, President Obama and his team 
tried to track the impact of the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) on jobs. They required 
recipients to report on job creation and set up a 
­website, www.recovery.defense.gov, to offer the 
­public this information.
	
Tracking the job creation, though, turned out to be 
more difficult than expected. Part of the problem was 
the sheer diversity of projects. ARRA-funded projects 
included everything from $23 million to help complete 
biking and walking trails near Philadelphia and Camden, 
New Jersey; to $73 million for the construction of 
­“Warriors in Transition Barracks” for military personnel 
who were wounded in Iraq or Afghanistan; to $1.6 billion 
for cleaning up the Savannah River nuclear weapons 
site in South Carolina.
	
In the end, the best estimates of the job impact of 
ARRA came from the spending and job multipliers used 
by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). For example, 
in a February 2015 report, CBO estimated that spend-
ing on infrastructure had a spending multiplier of as little 
as 0.4, or as much as 2.2, spread over several quarters.
	
Based on this assumption, CBO estimated that the 
stimulus program raised GDP by as little as 0.4 percent 
or as much as 1.8 percent in 2009, by 0.7 percent to 
4.1 percent in 2010, and by 0.4 percent to 2.3 percent 
in 2011. Similarly, CBO estimated that the stimulus 
raised employment by 200,000 to 900,000 jobs in 
2009, by 700,000 to 3.3 million jobs in 2010, and by 
500,000 to 2.6 million jobs in 2011.
	
What’s remarkable is how wide these ranges are. 
Despite the best efforts of economists, macroeconomic 
policy is still an inexact science.

Fiscal Policy
workers into long-term jobs generally 
has a big multiplier effect because 
these workers are likely to spend a lot 
of their wages. But a program that 
hands out money to rich Americans is 
unlikely to have the same immediate 
impact on GDP.
Overseas Leakage
Another factor affecting the multiplier is the amount of 
money that’s spent on goods and services produced in the 
United States versus the amount spent on imports. Govern-
ment spending, if it is to boost output, needs to encourage 
production and employment in the United States. But in a 
world where so many products are made overseas, it be-
comes more likely that fiscal stimulus will lead to increased 
imports rather than to faster growth at home. This transfer of 
domestic economic stimulus to foreign markets is known as 
overseas leakage.
Leakage was less important in the past. In the 1960s, for 
example, imports of goods and services equaled only 4 per-
cent of gross domestic purchases. As of 2015, imports of 
goods and services made up almost 16 percent of gross do-
mestic purchases. For some types of goods, such as cloth-
ing and toys, imports supply more than half of all U.S. 
purchases.
As overseas leakage grows, the multiplier from fiscal 
stimulus shrinks. That’s especially true when the govern-
ment purchases directly from overseas suppliers, which 
completely skips any job creation in the United States 
(see “Spotlight: Fiscal Stimulus and the Buy American 
Provision”).
The Size of the Multiplier
With all the different factors affecting the impact of govern-
ment spending on the economy, there is much disagreement 
among economists about the size of the job and spending 
multipliers. 
But as the next section shows, the exact size of the multi-
plier usually depends on where we are in the business cycle. 
What’s more, the use of government spending to boost the 
economy comes with some troubling negative consequences, 
including inflation and debt. These, too, will be discussed in 
the next section and the rest of the chapter.
THE LIMITATIONS OF SPENDING 
STIMULUS  LO11-3 
So far, we’ve focused on one aspect of fiscal policy: how 
increased government spending can boost employment and 
GDP. In the short run, this seems to imply that if the spend-
ing and job multipliers are greater than 1, a clear strategy 
exists for creating widespread prosperity: Ramp up govern-
ment budgets and watch the economy improve.
In fact, in the 1960s many economists and politicians be-
lieved that the government could get rid of unemployment 
and reduce poverty by stimulating the economy. In August 
1964, for example, President Lyndon Johnson signed a bill 
that created the Job Corps, an agency that trained and found 
jobs for poor young people who might otherwise not be em-
ployed. The stated goal was to drive the unemployment rate 
down to 4 percent or less.
But economists gradually learned that there were plenty 
of downsides to stimulating the economy through fiscal pol-
icy. In fact, those downsides greatly limited the situations in 
which the government could use spending as an economic 
strategy.
SPOTLIGHT: FISCAL 
STIMULUS AND THE BUY 
AMERICAN PROVISION
ARRA, the 2009 stimulus legislation, was intended to 
create jobs for Americans. To that end, Congress wanted 
to discourage the stimulus funds from being used to buy 
imported goods. So, the legislation contained a “Buy 
American” provision—public works projects funded by 
the legislation had to be built only using “iron, steel, and 
manufactured goods . . . produced in the United States.”
	
Seems clear, right? Except that the legislation con-
tained several large exceptions to the Buy American 
rule. The government is allowed to waive the rule if it 
costs too much to buy American, if American-made 
goods are not available in sufficient quantities, or if 
the agency overseeing a project says that requiring 
American-made products would be “inconsistent with 
the public interest.”
	
For example, ARRA included funding for making high-
speed broadband available to more people. But because 
most broadband equipment uses components from all 
over the world, the government had to issue a broad 
waiver of the Buy American requirement to achieve its 
goals. Another example: The Air Force wanted to con-
struct housing for military families at an Alaskan base 
­using ARRA funds. But the Air Force waived the Buy 
American requirements when it couldn’t find domestic-
made versions of a “Residential Style Polished Chrome 
Toilet Paper Holder” and other similar items.
	
In the end, it’s hard to say how much impact the Buy 
American requirements had or how much of the fiscal 
stimulus leaked overseas. In a global economy, buying 
American is easier to say than to accomplish.

The Perils of Inflation
Let’s start with inflation. In the previous section, we showed 
how the bridge repair effort by the government would in-
crease the quantities demanded of labor, construction mate-
rials, and all sorts of other goods and services. But if we 
look again at Figures 11.1 and 11.2, we also see something 
else: an increase in wages and prices.
In other words, an attempt to use govern-
ment spending to boost the economy also tends 
to create inflation. The extra government 
spending pushes up demand, and prices and 
wages rise faster than they would otherwise.
This makes sense. In the bridge example, 
the government would need to hire a lot of 
skilled construction workers. If they already 
had jobs in the private sector, the government 
would need to offer higher wages to lure them 
away. Similarly, the need for steel for the 
bridge is likely to raise the price of steel. As a result, in the 
short term, an increase in government spending raises 
wages and prices.
Which effect of government spending is likely to be 
stronger—the impact on output or the impact on inflation? 
It depends on where we are in the business cycle. Re-
member from Chapter 10 that the business cycle consists of 
recession and expansion. During a recession, the unemploy-
ment rate rises above the natural rate. Real GDP drops and 
falls beneath potential GDP until the economy reaches a 
trough. Then the process reverses itself.
In the depths of a recession, when things seem miserable, 
there are plenty of underutilized resources—workers, facto-
ries, buildings, equipment. At that point, an increase in gov-
ernment spending can provide an effective boost to the 
economy. The job and spending multipliers will be relatively 
high, and the effect on inflation will be relatively low. For 
example, if there are many unemployed skilled construction 
workers, a new government bridge-building project can 
lower unemployment without depriving private companies 
of their workforce.
But what if the economy is already doing very well? 
Then, most available resources and workers are already be-
ing used by private industry. So, if the government comes in 
and boosts spending, there will be a big effect on inflation 
and relatively small job and spending multipliers. Returning 
to the bridge example, if most skilled construction workers 
are already employed in private jobs, the government’s need 
for help with the new bridge will bid up the cost of workers 
rather than adding to employment.
In other words, an increase in government spending is 
more likely to have a positive impact on jobs and output 
when the economy is well into a recession so that the unem-
ployment rate is above the natural rate and real GDP is be-
low potential GDP. An increase in government spending is 
more likely to lead to higher inflation when the unemploy-
ment rate is below the natural rate and real GDP is above 
potential GDP.
Here’s another way to think about it: In some 
respects, a recession is like a big pothole in a 
highway. It makes the ride bumpier, slower, and 
more dangerous. And just as a paving crew fills 
in the pothole with asphalt, the government can 
fill in the recession “pothole” by increasing 
spending. That gives business and individuals a 
smoother ride.
But what if the paving crew keeps pouring 
on asphalt after the pothole is filled? The cars 
don’t move faster. Instead, we just get a big bump in the road 
that may even cause more problems than the original pot-
hole did. Similarly, if the government continues to boost 
spending after the recession is over, we get more inflation 
rather than faster growth.
Indeed, this explains why President Johnson’s attempt to 
push the unemployment rate down below 4 percent in the 
1960s didn’t work over the long run. He could boost govern-
ment spending, and he did, to create additional jobs at a time 
when the economy was already doing well. But that also led 
to an acceleration of inflation—not a good thing.
Lags in Policy
That brings us to the next problem: figuring out the right 
time for the government to spend. When an economy goes 
into recession, unemployment rises and 
real GDP falls ­below potential GDP. 
So, according to the analysis we’ve just 
seen, boosting government spending in 
a recession should be stimulative—
that is, it should have a good chance of 
pushing up output and reducing unem-
ployment in the short run. But now 
here’s a question: When an economic 
downturn hits, can ­Congress and the 
president increase government spend-
ing quickly enough to do any good?
This may seem like an odd issue, but 
it’s tougher for them to do so than you 
might think. There are big lags in the

government response. First, it takes time to recognize that the 
economy is in a recession. Moreover, any major project—like 
a new bridge—takes months or years to get going. The money 
has to be approved by Congress and signed by the president, 
which does not happen quickly. Then the construction con-
tracts have to be given out, which is also not a quick process. 
Given that the recession of 1990–1991 and the recession of 
2001 both lasted only eight months, the stimulative spending 
may not actually take effect until after the recession has ended.
If the spending comes when the economy is already out 
of recession, it is worse than simply being late: It adds to 
inflation. For that reason, in past downturns, recession-
fighting policy has focused on tax cuts (to be covered in the 
next section) and changes in monetary policy (to be covered 
in the next chapter).
Of course, the Great Recession lasted long enough for 
Washington to react with fiscal stimulus. The downturn 
started in December 2007, and ARRA was not passed until 
February 2009, 14 months later. However, the recession was 
still going on, and the stimulus was much welcomed.
TAXATION  LO11-4 
Up to this point, we’ve focused on the impact of 
government spending. But remember that the 
money the government spends has to come 
from somewhere. Either the government raises 
funds through taxes, or it 
borrows.
Let’s first look at the 
economic effects of tax in-
creases or tax cuts. Then in the next 
section we’ll examine government 
borrowing.
The Basics
The main source of money for govern-
ment spending is taxation. Taxes in-
clude a diverse collection of ways in 
which the government raises money: 
income tax, property tax on the value 
of homes and commercial buildings, 
payroll tax that funds Social Security 
and Medicare, corporate income tax, 
sales tax on retail purchases, and excise 
tax on gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol. 
In addition, there are all sorts of 
smaller taxes, such as taxes on hotel 
rooms, airline tickets, and sporting 
events (often called an amusement 
tax). Table 11.2 lists the major taxes in 
the United States.
We often complain about being over-
taxed, and certainly the government 
­collects a lot more tax than it used to. But 
­compared to the size of the economy, tax 
­collections have not changed much in the past 
30 years or so.
In 1970, governments at all levels collected 
taxes and fees totaling roughly 27 percent of 
GDP. Surprisingly,  taxes and fees were only 
29  percent of GDP in 2015—taking just a 
slightly larger share of the economy compared 
to their level 45 years earlier. The reason? Tax collections 
have risen enormously since 1974, but so has GDP.
Changes in the Tax System
The single biggest tax is the federal personal income tax. 
Figure 11.3 shows the income tax as a share of GDP, along 
with key changes in tax policy.
When the tax share rises, as it did in the late 1970s and 
the late 1990s, political pressure for tax cuts mounts. For 
example, the federal income tax as a share of GDP peaked 
at 9.3 percent in 1981, the year President Ronald Reagan 
proposed and got Congress to approve deep tax cuts. Simi-
larly, the federal income tax share of GDP reached a peak 
of 10.0 percent in 2000, making it easy for ­President 
George W. Bush to make a case for cutting taxes.
But when the income tax share falls as it did in the early 
1990s, it becomes easier for the legislature to pass tax in-
creases. For example, the tax share reached a low of 
7.5 percent in 1992, the year Bill Clinton was elected presi-
dent. Once in office, Clinton proposed an income tax 
increase.
The big exception to this general pattern, however, is 
2009. Despite the relatively low share of GDP going to the

personal income tax, President Obama did not push to raise 
tax rates because of the weakness of the economy. Instead, 
he waited until 2013, when the economy had improved, to 
raise taxes on top earners. 
So far, we have focused on the personal income tax. 
However, big shifts have occurred in other kinds of taxes. 
For example, the corporate income tax has shrunk as a 
share of the total tax pie. In part, that’s because corpora-
tions have good lobbyists, who help rewrite the tax code to 
favor them. But it’s also the result of globalization, which 
means companies earn more of their money overseas. That 
makes it much harder for the U.S. government to tax com-
pany profits.
In comparison, a much bigger proportion of tax revenue 
now comes from payroll taxes—the taxes on wages that pay 
for Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance, and 
the like. Payroll taxes have been hiked several times as poli-
cymakers struggle to ensure that these programs are well 
funded. Currently, employees pay 6.2 percent of their wages 
for Social Security, on income up to a maximum of $118,500 
in 2016, and 1.45 percent of wages for Medicare, with no 
upper limit. Employers chip in the same amount. (We will 
discuss Social Security and ­Medicare further in Chapter 18.)
The Direct Impact of Taxes
Obviously, if you pay a dollar to the government in taxes, 
that’s a dollar you don’t have available to spend. Disposable 
income is defined as the amount of income people have left 
after paying taxes.
Naturally, tax cuts tend to boost disposable income, 
whereas tax increases tend to lower it (leaving out the effect 
of anything else the government might do). As a result, an 
increase in taxes will generally dampen spending, and a de-
crease in taxes will boost spending. In other words, tax cuts 
are stimulative, meaning that they 
lower unemployment and increase 
GDP in the short run, all other things 
being equal. By contrast, tax increases 
are contractionary, meaning they tend 
to reduce output and employment, all 
other things being equal.
Changes in taxes also have an impact 
on inflation. In particular, a decrease in 
taxes will boost wages and prices in 
the short term, all other things being 
equal. To see why, look at ­Figure 11.4, 
which shows the short-term impact of

a reduction in income taxes on the market for cars. As taxes 
are cut, disposable incomes go up, which shifts the demand 
curve for cars (as well as for other goods and services) to the 
right. As a result, the new quantity demanded in the market 
is higher, and so is the price of cars.
Using Tax Cuts to Fight Recession
If the economy goes into recession, the government can cut 
taxes as a way of putting money into the hands of people who 
may otherwise be struggling financially and unable to spend. 
In some ways, this is similar to the argu-
ment in favor of boosting spending to 
fight recessions. As shown in Fig-
ure 11.4, a tax cut is stimulative.
What’s more, as the effect of a tax 
cut spreads through the economy, econ-
omists can estimate the tax multiplier, 
which is the increase in GDP from a 
$1 cut in taxes. The tax multiplier de-
pends on the marginal propensity to 
consume and overseas leakage, among 
other things.
However, for fighting recession, a 
tax cut has a big advantage over a 
spending increase: The tax cut can be 
put into effect more quickly. For exam-
ple, in January 2008, President George 
W. Bush proposed a tax rebate—a type 
of one-time tax cut. The rebate was 
quickly passed by Congress. The first rebate checks were in 
the hands of Americans by May 2008, while the economy 
was still struggling. That’s fast enough to be effective.
Incentives and Taxes
However, fighting recession is not the only reason why 
some economists and politicians favor lowering taxes. In 
the 1970s a group of economists began to focus on the neg-
ative incentive effects of taxes. That is, higher taxes dis-
courage whatever activity is being taxed. So, if labor 
income is heavily taxed, you are less likely to work hard. A 
high sales tax on clothing would make you less likely to buy 
clothing and more likely to buy something else. And a 
heavy tax on profits, which lessens the benefit of being suc-
cessful in business, would make it less likely for you to start 
a new company.
This link between taxes and incentives is the essential 
­insight of supply-side economics. Supply-side economics 
focuses on the marginal tax rate: the tax you pay on the last 
dollar of income you earn. For example, when the marginal 
tax rate is 30 percent, if you earn an extra dollar, the govern-
ment gets 30 percent of it and you get 70 percent.
Different people may have different marginal tax rates, 
depending on their level of income and the tax code. The 
marginal tax rate is important because it determines your in-
centives for working a bit more. If your marginal tax rate 
were 95 percent, for example, it would not pay for you to 
increase your hours of work because the government would 
be taking 95 cents of every additional dollar you made. But 
if your marginal tax rate were 10 percent, the federal govern-
ment’s share would be close to zero.
Supply-side economics argues that cutting taxes gives 
people an incentive to work and invest more. Over the past 
30 years, many economists and politicians have accepted 
the proposition that cutting marginal tax rates can be bene-
ficial. In the 1950s, as shown in Figure 11.5, the top mar-
ginal tax rate (the rate paid by those in the highest income 
brackets) was actually around 90 percent. To pick just one 
year—say, 1955—the tax code called for a 91 percent tax 
rate on a married couple with a taxable income greater 
than $400,000 (adjusting for inflation, that $400,000 would 
be worth about $3 million today). That’s an amazingly high 
tax rate.
But the top marginal rate was repeatedly lowered over 
time. As of 2016, the top marginal rate for the federal in-
come tax was down to 39.6 percent for married couples with 
taxable income greater than $466,950.
One extreme version of supply-side economics argues 
that cutting taxes can stimulate enough work and investment 
to actually increase tax revenues. That has been one argu-
ment given in favor of tax cuts, starting with Ronald 
­Reagan’s 1981 cuts and continuing through to George 
W. Bush’s tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. But most economists 
­today accept that cutting marginal tax rates simply decreases 
tax revenues.
FIGURE 11.4 
The Stimulative Effect  
of a Tax Cut
A tax cut boosts the disposable income of consumers, which 
causes their demand curve for goods and services (such as 
cars) to shift to the right. This boosts the quantity supplied

BORROWING  LO11-5 
If there is a gap between spending and tax rev-
enues—as there was in 2015—the government 
has to borrow money to make up the difference. 
On one level, borrowing by the federal, state, or 
local government is no different from an indi-
vidual or company taking out a loan. But the 
government borrows on a scale that is unimagi-
nable for an individual or a business—and this 
has an impact on the whole economy.
Budget Deficits and Surpluses
The excess of the federal government’s spending over its 
revenues is the budget deficit. In fiscal year 2015 (which 
ended September 30, 2015), the federal government spent 
$3.7 trillion and took in $3.3 trillion. The difference be-
tween the two ($3.3 trillion − $3.7 trillion) was the budget 
deficit, which totaled roughly $400 billion, coming to 
2.5 percent of GDP.
To pay for a budget deficit, a government borrows money 
from investors. (In Chapter 13, we’ll discuss government 
bonds, which are how the government borrows.) The total of 
all the government’s borrowing is called the 
public debt. If the government runs a deficit, 
then the public debt increases. As of 2015, the 
public debt was $13 trillion.
We see in Figure 11.6 that from year to year, 
the budget deficit rises and falls, getting as deep 
as 10 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2009 (in the 
figure, negative numbers represent deficits and 
positive numbers represent surpluses). There 
were several years, includ-
ing 1999 through 2001, 
when the budget was in surplus—that 
is, revenues exceeded spending. Over-
all, the budget has mostly been in defi-
cit in recent decades.
Why does the deficit swing so 
much? One reason is the state of the 
economy. Generally, the deficit widens 
during recessions because workers and 
companies earn less income. As a 
­result, less tax revenue comes in; be-
cause unemployment is higher, the 
government also has to pay out more

for unemployment insurance. During good times, the deficit 
narrows because tax revenues rise along with the economy.
The deficit is also affected by changes in tax rates. The 
big tax cut put through by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 
was one reason the deficit was so large in fiscal year 1983. 
Similarly, President George W. Bush’s tax cuts helped flip 
the budget from a surplus in 2001 to deficits in subsequent 
years. Finally, deficits usually rise during wars because the 
United States, like other countries, is willing to borrow to 
finance national defense.
The Stimulative Effect of Bigger Deficits
In the short run, increasing the federal budget deficit has a 
stimulative effect on the economy. A bigger deficit could 
occur if the government boosted spending without raising 
taxes by the same amount, or if it cut taxes without a 
matching cut in spending. In either case, more money 
would stay in the pockets of U.S. consumers, and the gov-
ernment would have to borrow more.
For example, in 2001 President George W. Bush proposed a 
sharp tax cut, which Congress passed. Three things happened 
as a result. First, the federal budget went from $128 billion in 
surplus in 2001 to $158 billion in deficit in 2002. Second, the 
disposable income of U.S. consumers—that is, the income 
they had left after taxes were taken out—rose in 2002, even 
though employment was weak and the economy was sluggish. 
Third, consumer spending continued to rise as well.
These three facts are related. In general, an increase or 
decrease in the budget deficit serves as a rough-and-ready 
measure of the amount of fiscal stimulus applied to the 
economy. In this case, the total fiscal stimulus was roughly 
equal to $286 billion ($128 billion plus $158 billion, or the 
size of the swing from surplus to deficit). 
Of course, the 2002 stimulus was dwarfed by the Great 
Recession, when the budget deficit went from $459 billion 
in 2008 to a staggering $1413 billion in 2009. This was an 
enormous stimulus to the economy.
During a recession, the budget deficit generally increases 
because tax revenues weaken while expenditures rise. That

increase in the deficit is known as an automatic stabilizer 
because the widening budget deficit pumps stimulus into 
the economy without the need for the government to change 
tax rates.
Crowding Out
However, government borrowing does have negative effects 
on the rest of the economy. When the budget deficit rises, 
the increased borrowing pushes the demand schedule for 
loans to the right, as we see in Figure 11.7. That, in turn, 
pushes the interest rate up from r to r′.
The law of demand tells us that if something is more expen-
sive, the market will buy less of it. So when the government’s 
increased borrowing makes capital more expensive, busi-
ness will be able to afford less investment in equipment and 
structures, and consumers can spend less on consumer 
­durables such as homes and cars.
This phenomenon is known as crowding out. In effect, 
the government competes with the private sector for capital 
and elbows the private sector out of the way. Crowding out 
is bad in the short run because it lessens the stimulative 
­effect of a bigger budget deficit. The fiscal stimulus may 
generate jobs and income, but it is accompanied by a 
­reduction in private investment. Crowding out is also bad 
­because with less capital investment, businesses are less 
productive. Over the long run, that means economic growth 
will be slower.
The damage done by crowding out is not as apparent as 
the pain of taxation. You can see how much the government 
is taking from you in taxes just by looking at your paycheck 
or tax returns. It’s much harder to see how much government 
borrowing has raised the interest rate.
The Impact of Budget Deficits in  
the Long Run
No discussion of the budget deficit would be complete 
without a mention of its long-run impact. As of 2015, the 
federal budget deficit has fallen to only 2.5 percent of 
GDP, as the economy has recovered and tax revenues rise. 
Out of that total, roughly half the deficit comes from in-
terest payments on federal debt. In other words, the fed-
eral government is borrowing in part to pay interest on 
existing debt. 
Going forward, the Congressional Budget Office projects 
that the deficit will steadily rise as a share of GDP. Part of 
that is due to increased obligations to care for an aging pop-
ulation. But the CBO also projects that the federal govern-
ment will get stuck in a self-feeding cycle, where it has to 
keep borrowing more money to pay interest on its debt—but 
the more money it borrows, the more interest it has to pay in 
the future.  
This is definitely not a desirable outcome. Therefore, it is 
necessary to get the long-term budget deficit under control, 
which means doing something about controlling the cost of 
Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. That’s an issue we 
will cover in more detail in Chapter 18.
Putting It All Together
As we have seen, there are a lot of things going on simulta-
neously in fiscal policy. Congress and the president can raise 
or lower government spending. They can raise or lower 
taxes. Then the combination of these 
two decisions can lead to a bigger or 
smaller budget deficit, which changes 
the amount of borrowing.
All the fiscal policy actions put to-
gether can affect employment, output, 
inflation, and interest rates. It’s useful 
to see all the impacts in one place. 
­Table 11.3 summarizes the positive and 
negative impacts of the different ac-
tions the federal government can take. 
For example, lowering taxes can create 
jobs, boost GDP, and provide incen-
tives for work and investment—but it 
can also widen the budget deficit and 
pump up interest rates.
The effects listed in the table work in 
the opposite direction as well. ­Suppose 
the government raised taxes. That would

Borrowing on Interest Rates

have a contractionary effect on employment and GDP while 
potentially reducing inflation and interest rates because the gov-
ernment would be borrowing less, all other things being equal.
What Table 11.3 does not include is a summary of the 
relative sizes of the different effects. That’s partly because 
they depend on where we are in the business cycle. It’s also 
because economists disagree about which impacts are bigger. 
Is the incentive effect of a tax cut more or less important than 
its direct effect on jobs and GDP? You could poll 10 econo-
mists and get 10 different answers. That’s what makes fiscal 
policy one of the most hotly disputed areas in economics.
CONCLUSION
We’ve seen in this chapter that fiscal policy can affect the 
economy. In the short run, the spending and taxation deci-
sions of the government can influence output, employment, 
prices, and wages. That’s especially important when the 
economy is going into a recession.
However, economists usually regard monetary policy—
which is controlled by the Federal Reserve—as a more 
­effective tool for adjusting the economy. That’s what we will 
discuss in the next chapter.

SUMMARY
	 1.	Fiscal policy is composed of decisions about govern-
ment spending, taxes, and borrowing. The level of 
government spending is set by the political system, 
and that spending is funded through a combination of 
taxation and borrowing. (LO11-1)
	 2.	In the short term, an increase in government spending 
lowers unemployment and increases GDP, all other 
things being equal. This is the essence of the Keynes-
ian approach to macroeconomics, which uses in-
creases in government spending and cuts in taxes to 
fight recessions. The multiplier effect is the overall 
boost in economic activity that flows from the spend-
ing increase. The size of the multiplier is determined, 
in part, by the marginal propensity to consume and 
the amount of overseas leakage. (LO11-2)
	 3.	Stimulating the economy by government spending 
has a downside as well. In the short term, an increase 
in government spending can raise wages and prices 
and boost inflation. That’s more likely if lags in policy 
make the fiscal stimulus show up after the recession is 
over. (LO11-3)
	 4.	In the short term, a decrease in taxes lowers unem-
ployment and increases GDP, all other things being 
equal. That same decrease in taxes tends to boost 
wages and prices, all other things being equal. Sup-
ply-side economics argues that changes in marginal 
tax rates affect incentives to work. In response to 
these arguments, marginal tax rates have come down 
substantially over time. (LO11-4)
	 5.	Increasing the budget deficit can stimulate the econ-
omy, boosting employment and GDP. However, gov-
ernment borrowing can push up interest rates and 
crowd out private-sector investment. (LO11-5)

We’ll explain the Fed’s 
main goals and how it 
conducts monetary 
policy, using control 
over interest rates, di-
rect lending to financial 
institutions, and other 
policy tools to influence the economy.
	
We’ll look at the economic conse-
quences of monetary policy, and we’ll 
discuss some recent issues and prob-
lems faced by the Fed, both during the 
Great Recession and in the recovery that 
followed. 
D
uring the financial crisis of 2007–
2009, the Federal Reserve, the na-
tion’s central bank, took unprecedented 
steps to keep the economy from collaps-
ing. Led by then-Chairman Ben Bernanke, 
the Federal Reserve—also known as “the 
Fed”—lent more than a trillion dollars to 
banks and other financial institutions that 
were in danger of failing. At the same 
time, the Fed cut its key interest rate, the 
fed funds rate, to nearly zero.
	
Since then, the Fed—first under 
­Bernanke and then led by Chair Janet

THE USES  
OF MONEY  LO12-1 
There are more ways to invest and 
make money today than ever before—
and more ways to lose it too. We’ll look 
at some of them in detail when we dis-
cuss the financial markets in the next 
chapter, but here we’re concerned with 
the question, What is money?
On the simplest level, money is 
made up of the bills and coins you have 
in your pocket, which have been printed 
or minted by the U.S. gov-
ernment (these are called 
currency). But money also 
includes the funds stored 
as electronic entries in your 
checking accounts and sav-
ings accounts.
Money serves three purposes. First, 
it is a medium of exchange. You can 
use money to buy goods and services 
and accept money in exchange for the 
goods and services you provide. A mar-
ket economy would be impossible 
without money.
Second, money is a store of value. 
You can hold onto money to use later. 
So, when you put your money into a 
bank, you expect that you will be able to take it out sometime 
in the future and that it will still be able to buy goods and 
services.
Third, money is a standard of value. It lets you make 
comparisons. If two houses sell for the same amount of 
money, then—at that moment—they are equally valuable. If 
you are willing to pay more for one car than another, then—
at that moment—the first car is more valuable to you.
For all three uses of money, it doesn’t matter whether you 
have cash in your pocket, write a check, or pull some money 
out of your savings account. All three are equivalent, which 
is why we call them all money. (See “Spotlight: How Much 
Money Is There?”)
However, money—whether it’s a $10 bill or 
an entry in a bank database—always has an 
­element of trust built in. When you work, you 
accept money for your labor, trusting that busi-
nesses you frequent will be willing to accept 
your tens and twenties in exchange for goods 
and services. And when you put your hard-
earned cash in the bank, you trust that it will be worth some-
thing in the future when you take it out. If we lose trust, 
money can turn worthless in a moment. Those bills in your 
pocket would be nothing but pieces of green paper, and 
those electronic entries at the bank would have nothing to 
back them up.
Maintaining public trust in the value of a currency is 
­paramount for a well-functioning economy. As a result, even 
the most free market–minded economists agree that a finan-
cial system needs a strong regulator with enormous powers. 
SPOTLIGHT: HOW MUCH MONEY IS THERE?
You might think it would be easy to figure out how much 
money there is. After all, the government knows the 
amount of currency—how many bills it prints and how 
many coins it mints. As of December 2015, there was 
about $1.4 trillion in currency in circulation. Out of that 
amount, roughly $1 trillion was in $100 bills. 
	
But the definition of money is actually broader than that 
because people generally have only a small amount of 
cash in their pockets. Instead, they keep their money in 
checking and savings accounts or earn interest in a certifi-
cate of deposit or a money market fund (we will describe 
these further in Chapter 13). Checking deposits are not 
much different from cash because they can be easily 
­accessed by writing checks or using a debit card. It’s a bit 
of a slower process to get at savings accounts, certificate 
of deposits, or money market funds, but the money is still 
accessible and spendable.
	
The Fed keeps track of two measures of the money 
stock, called M1 and M2. M1 includes currency and 
checking accounts, basically, whereas M2 adds in 
­savings accounts, certificates of deposits, and money 
market funds. As of December 2015, M1 was $3.1 trillion 
and M2 was $12.3 trillion. M1 and M2 used to be of 
great importance, but these days they are rarely 
­mentioned by economists or by members of the Fed.

Therefore, in most countries printing money is 
strictly a ­government monopoly. In theory, any-
one could print money. For example, Fred down 
the street could issue his own Fred money, and 
you’d have a choice about whether to accept it as 
legal tender.
Government-issued money has several ad-
vantages. First, everyone knows which bills are 
valid. There’s no need to worry about whether 
that “Bank of Fred” currency will be accepted at the local 
store, or whether the Bank of Fred will go out of business 
next year, leaving you with worthless bills. There’s also no 
need to try and figure out whether those twenties with a pic-
ture of Fred on them are worth more or less than the twenties 
issued by the “Bank of Sam.”
Second, having a single source of money under govern-
ment control makes it easier for policymakers to guide and 
control an economy. That is, the government can print 
money—and destroy it, if need be—to influence output, 
­employment, inflation, and interest rates. Finally, having 
control over the money supply helps a government maintain 
trust in its money. The U.S. dollar is backed by the “full faith 
and credit” of the U.S. government—and, ultimately, that is 
a very powerful thing.
THE HISTORY OF THE FEDERAL 
RESERVE  LO12-2 
In the United States, the prime guardian of the financial 
­system is the Federal Reserve System, also known as the 
country’s central bank. Congress founded the Federal 
­Reserve System in 1913 in response to a financial panic in 
1907. That panic—which few people except economists and 
historians remember today—wiped out several big banks 
and sent the stock market plummeting by nearly 50 percent. 
To avoid a repetition of this near disaster, it became clear 
that a strong central bank was needed to step in and help 
support the financial system when things went bad.
The creation of the Federal Reserve was a milestone in 
U.S. economic history. The Fed, as it is often called, had 
the power to issue currency, set key interest rates, and lend 
­directly to banks—the first time a government agency was 
given such strong tools for directly influencing the 
economy.
The Structure of the Fed
The Federal Reserve was set up as a system of 
banks, not as a single bank. At the head is the 
Federal Reserve Board, based in Washington, 
consisting of a seven-person Board of ­Governors. 
The Federal Reserve Board is housed in an im-
pressive building in Washington, DC, with very 
tight security. Congress also created 12 ­regional 
Federal Reserve Banks around the country, in 
part to gain the support of western and south-
ern politicians. But creation of the regional 
banks also reflects the fact that the Fed was set 
up in 1913, when communication and travel 
were not as easy as they are today. As a result, 
having local branches, so to speak, was 
essential.
As the country’s central bank, the Fed was 
designed to have quite a bit of independence. 
True, the U.S. president appoints the members of its Board 
of Governors, including the chair. But the Fed funds its own 
operations, so it doesn’t need budget allocations from 
­Congress. And members of the Board of Governors serve 
14-year terms, which end in different years, so a single 
president can’t replace the whole board. The chair of the 
board of governors, who holds most of the power, is 
­appointed for a four-year renewable term. Alan Greenspan, 
for example, was first appointed chairman in 1987 and, 
through reappointments, served until 2006. Greenspan was 
followed as chairman by Ben ­Bernanke, who was, in turn, 
followed by Janet Yellen as chair in 2014.
If the central bank were not independent, it could come 
under pressure to adopt monetary policies that benefit the 
political party in power but are not necessarily good for 
the country as a whole. For example, the central bank could 
cut interest rates just before an election to gain votes for the 
party in power.
THE GOALS AND TOOLS OF 
MONETARY POLICY  LO12-3 
The Federal Reserve was created in response to a crash in 
the financial markets. Not surprisingly, its original purpose 
was to maintain financial system stability and people’s trust 
in the currency. Although that aim is still important, over 
time the Fed has taken on a wider variety of objectives and 
concerns.
In 1978 Congress passed the Humphrey–Hawkins Act, 
which clearly specified a broad set of goals for the Fed:
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
­System and the Federal Open Market Committee 
shall maintain long-run growth of the monetary and 
credit aggregates commensurate with the economy’s 
long-run potential to increase production, so 
as to promote effectively the goals of maxi-
mum employment, stable 
prices, and moderate long-
term interest rates.
In other words, the Fed 
was supposed to strive for 
high job creation, low in-
flation, and low interest 
rates—something for 
everyone!

CH 12 
Monetary Policy
In reality, the Fed today does not follow the exact list 
of objectives in the 1978 legislation. Instead they have 
taken a slightly different form. Today the main goals of 
monetary policy are controlling inflation, smoothing 
out the business cycle, and ensuring financial stability 
(Table 12.1). We’ll look at each of 
these in turn.
Controlling Inflation
Under most circumstances the top 
goal of monetary policy is to keep 
­inflation under control. Central bank-
ers have always worried about infla-
tion because rising prices eat away 
at the value of money, as we saw in 
Chapter 8.
But that concern intensified after the 
experience of the 1970s, when the infla-
tion rate spiked into the double digits. 
When Paul Volcker became chairman 
of the Fed in August 1979, the inflation 
rate was almost 12 percent—far too 
high to be acceptable—and Volcker’s 
aim was to get it down in any way pos-
sible. As we will see later in this chap-
ter, he succeeded—but at the price of a 
deep recession.
Alan Greenspan, who followed 
­Volcker as Fed chairman in 1987, re-
peatedly argued that a low, stable 
­inflation rate was the best way to 
achieve strong economic growth. In 
1988, he told Congress, for example, 
that the right goal for monetary policy was to guide the 
economy to 
a situation in which households and businesses in 
making their saving and investment decisions can 
safely ignore the possibility of sustained, general-
ized price increases or decreases.
In other words, the Fed should keep the rate of inflation con-
tained so that no one really pays attention to it. How low a 
rate is that? Depending on whom you ask, it can be any-
where between zero and 2 percent per year.
One important point: You might think that if low infla-
tion is good, then deflation—falling prices—must be better. 
But central bankers see deflation as a bad thing. As we saw 
in Chapter 8, falling prices hurt debtors because loans 
­become harder to pay back.
Smoothing Out the Business Cycle
In the United States, the Federal Reserve has the primary 
responsibility for fighting recessions. So, when the economy 
slows and the unemployment rate starts to rise, economists, 
businesspeople, and politicians want to know what the Fed 
is going to do about it.
In response to rising unemployment, the main thing that 
the Federal Reserve can do is cut interest rates (we’ll see 
how that works in the next section). Lower interest rates 
stimulate purchases of things like cars and homes, thus 
boosting the economy.
Ensuring Financial Stability
Under ordinary circumstances, people don’t worry that 
their bank or other financial institution will go out of busi-
ness overnight. However, in times of crisis, there’s an 
­understandable fear that your investments could suddenly 
vanish. When that happens, the role of the Fed is to calm

GOALS OF MONETARY 
POLICY
The main goals of mon-
etary policy are control-
ling inflation, smoothing 
out the business cycle, 
and ensuring financial 
stability.
CONTROLLING 
INFLATION
One key goal of the 
Federal Reserve, which 
tries to keep inflation 
below a certain level.
SMOOTHING OUT THE 
BUSINESS CYCLE
One key goal of the 
Federal Reserve, which 
tries to keep the econ-
omy from dropping 
into a steep recession.
ENSURING FINANCIAL 
STABILITY
One key goal of the 
Federal Reserve, 
which tries to keep 
the financial system 
functioning well.
The Federal Reserve has been a role model for central banks in other 
parts of the world. The European Central Bank (ECB) was set up in 1998 
to manage the euro, the European currency. Based in Frankfurt, Germany, 
the ECB is independent of political control, like the Fed. However, the 
ECB places more emphasis on controlling inflation than the Fed does.

things down by making sure banks and other financial insti-
tutions have the money they need to function.
In fact, the Fed is the lender of last resort during a financial 
crisis. Having a lender of last resort is essential for a well-­
functioning market economy because a meltdown in the finan-
cial markets would bring most transactions to a halt. In the 
worst case, businesses wouldn’t be able to accept credit cards or 
pay their employees, individuals wouldn’t be able to get access 
to their stock market accounts or other investments, home buy-
ers wouldn’t be able to get mortgages, and state and local 
­governments might not be able to fund their daily operations. 
Unfortunately, this devastating scenario seemed possible 
in fall 2008 and early 2009. In one weekend in September 
2008, the Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers went bankrupt 
because of risky investments and real estate loans. And the 
giant insurance company AIG had to be rescued with an 
$85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve. Frederic ­Mishkin, 
an economist who served on the Federal Reserve Board until 
just before the collapse, wrote
The collapse of AIG therefore revealed how risky the 
financial system had become and that any further 
systemic shocks to the financial system could result 
in a complete breakdown. . . .
By March of 2009, the situation got downright terrify-
ing. . . . The fear was not unjustified. If another Lehman 
Brothers had occurred at that time, 
the financial system would have im-
ploded further, and it is likely that a 
depression would have ensued.

2009.
Figure 12.1 illustrates the impact of the financial crisis on 
stock prices and home prices.
Monetary Policy Tools
The Federal Reserve has four types of monetary policy tools 
available to help meet its goals (Table 12.2). For dealing 
with inflation and the normal ups and downs of the business 
cycle, the Fed can use its control over short-term interest 
rates. As we will see, this policy tool is effective for influ-
encing the behavior of both consumers and businesses. 
The second type of policy tool, called “quantitative eas-
ing,” or QE for short, is relatively new. In the aftermath of the 
financial crisis, the Fed faced a problem: It had already cut 
short-term interest rates as far as it could, but the economy 
was still struggling. QE provided a new way to pump money

into the financial system. 
Later in this chapter, we’ll 
discuss the policy actions 
that the Federal Reserve 
took to preserve the stabil-
ity of the financial system 
and to promote recovery. 
The third type of policy 
tool is direct lending to 
banks and other financial institutions. 
This is the big hammer in the Fed’s 
toolbox, and Chairman Bernanke used 
it to the full extent during the financial 
crisis. Indeed, being able to draw on 
funds from the Federal Reserve helped 
struggling financial institutions survive 
and kept the economy afloat. 
The final policy tool includes 
changes in the reserve requirement and 
other financial regulations. Tradition-
ally, the Fed has great regulatory power 
over many financial institutions, which 
it can use to influence the financial 
system. In 2010, Congress passed the 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act, designed to 
reduce the chances of another financial 
crisis. This legislation, usually just 
called Dodd-Frank, greatly expanded 
the Fed’s regulatory power in some 
ways and limited it in others. We will 
further discuss financial regulation in the next chapter. 
CONTROL OVER SHORT-TERM 
INTEREST RATES  LO12-4 
In this section, we will look at how the Fed controls short-term 
interest rates and the impact of this control on the economy.
Open Market Operations
The Fed’s most-used policy tool is its ability to control short-
term interest rates. You already know that interest rates affect 
the cost of borrowing. Short-term interest rates are relevant 
for loans with a relatively short length for repayment, like 
credit card balances and auto loans, and for adjustable-rate 
mortgages (these are home loans whose interest rates are al-
lowed to rise at set times). Long-term interest rates, on the 
other hand, are relevant for loans such as 30-year fixed-rate 
mortgages and long-term corporate borrowing.
The Federal Reserve can influence short-term interest 
rates via open market operations, which increase or de-
crease the amount of money available to banks for lending 
out. (See “How It Works: Behind the Scenes at the Fed.”)
Suppose the Fed wants to cut short-term interest rates. It 
executes an open market operation to make more money 
available for banks to lend. As a result, the sup-
ply curve for loans shifts right, as shown in Fig-
ure 12.2. The interest rate falls from r to r′, and 
the quantity of loans made increases. This 
works the opposite way, too, of course. If the 
Fed reduces the amount of money available to 
banks to lend, the supply curve for loans shifts 
left. Interest rates rise, and the quantity of loans 
made falls.
Historically, the Fed has not tried to directly control inter-
est rates on mortgages, credit cards, or auto loans. Instead 
the Fed targets a particular short-term interest rate called the 
fed funds rate. The fed funds rate is the rate banks charge 
each other for lending reserves overnight.
The fed funds rate is set by a vote of the Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC), which includes all seven 
members of the board of governors and presidents of 5 out 
of the 12 Federal Reserve banks on a rotating basis. The 
FOMC meets eight times a year, or roughly every six weeks 
or so, to discuss the economy and decide on monetary pol-
icy; it typically issues a short statement after each meeting 
explaining its decision.

CH 12 
Monetary Policy	
207
At each meeting of the Open Market Committee, the Fed 
tries to set the fed funds rate at a level that moves the economy 
in the right direction. Generally speaking, if the economy is 
running above potential GDP and inflation is too high, the 
Fed will raise the fed funds rate to slow the economy down. If 
the economy is running below potential and inflation is tame, 
the Fed will lower the fed funds rate to stimulate growth.
Which Interest Rates Can the Fed Affect?
You, as a consumer, will never pay the fed funds rate ­because 
it’s an interest rate that banks charge each other. However, 
the Fed’s control over the fed funds rate affects all other 
short-term interest rates, including those of credit cards, 
auto loans, and adjustable-rate mortgages, as well as rates on 
money market funds. True, they don’t necessarily move in 
lockstep with the fed funds rate. General Motors and Ford 
might offer their customers a better interest rate on their cars 
even if the fed funds rate goes up. But, in general, most 
short-term rates move more or less together.
For example, look at Figure 12.3, which reports two inter-
est rates: the fed funds rate and the average interest rate on 
new car loans. You can see that in the early part of the 1990s, 
as the Fed was raising the fed funds rate (bottom line), rates 
The Fed chairman doesn’t have two desk buttons that say 
“lower” and “raise” to control interest rates. Instead, when 
the Fed wants to change monetary policy by lowering or 
raising short-term interest rates, it takes a more round-
about route.
	
The first thing to realize is that banks are required to keep 
a portion of their deposits either in cash in their vaults or on 
reserve with the Fed (hence the name Federal Reserve). 
The more reserves they have, the more they can lend.
	
So, to lower interest rates, the Fed wants to make sure 
the banks have access to more reserves. That’s what an 
open market operation does. In an open market opera-
tion, the Fed buys government bonds or other securities, 
usually from a big bank or other financial institution, and 
electronically credits the financial institution with more re-
serves. The previous owner of the securities now has 
money that didn’t exist before, just as if the Fed had 
printed currency. The bank can now lend this extra money 
to borrowers, driving down short-term interest rates. Or it 
can lend the extra money to other banks, which then do 
more lending themselves.
	
Open market operations also work in reverse. If the Fed 
wants to raise rates, it sells some government securities it 
already owns. Then it reduces the money in the account of 
the purchaser. The net effect is that less money is avail-
able to be lent out and interest rates rise.

on auto loans went up as well. Then from 2000 to 2003, 
when the Fed was cutting the fed funds rate, auto loan rates 
dropped too. They rose again when the Fed raised the fed 
funds rate from 2004 to 2006. Finally, after the Fed cut the 
fed funds rate to nearly zero after the financial crisis, auto 
loan rates gradually declined as well.
The same pattern is seen for the interest rates on credit 
cards and many other types of short-term consumer and 
business loans. As the fed funds rate goes up and down, so 
do most other short-term interest rates.
Notice, however, that when the Fed cut the fed funds 
rate to nearly zero in 2008, the rate on new car loans took 
much longer to decline. In the immediate aftermath of the 
financial crisis, banks charged high rates on loans because 
they were reluctant to lend.
Effect of Rate Changes on the Economy
As the Fed pushes short-term interest rates up or down, the 
effects of its actions are felt most directly by interest rate-
sensitive sectors of the economy. These include motor vehi-
cles sales, housing, and anything consumers buy with credit 
cards. These are the sectors of the economy dependent on 
short-term borrowing, so a rate change by the Fed affects the 
cost of their purchases.
In general, a decrease in the fed funds rate boosts spend-
ing and GDP, whereas an increase in the fed funds rate di-
minishes spending and GDP. Let’s see how this operates; 
we’ll start with motor vehicle sales. Most car buyers finance 
their purchases either by borrowing money for their new ve-
hicles or by taking out leases. The monthly payments vary 
according to the prices of the cars, the length of the loans or 
leases, and the interest rates. The higher the interest rate, the 
higher the monthly payment; the lower the interest rate, the 
lower the payment. (See “How It Works: The Consumer 
Benefit from Rate Cuts.”)
Figure 12.4 shows what happens in the car market when 
there is a decline in the interest rates on auto loans. Even if 
the prices of cars don’t change, the quantity of cars de-
manded goes up when interest rates go down because the 
loan payments are lower. In the supply and demand diagram, 
that means the demand curve for cars shifts right when inter-
est rates fall.
The result of these lower interest rates is that the quantity 
of cars demanded rises from Q to Q′. Similarly, if interest 
When the Fed cuts the fed funds rate, other interest 
rates drop. And when other interest rates go down, you 
pay less if you need to borrow for a purchase.
	
Let’s work through an example. Suppose you buy a 
$30,000 new car and take out a loan for the entire 
amount. In 2000, a bank would have charged you a 
9.3 percent interest rate for a four-year (48-month) loan. 
But by 2004, the Federal Reserve had cut the fed funds 
rate 13 times, and the rates on auto loans had followed 
along. So in 2004, the comparable rate on the same 
auto loan was only 6.6 percent.
	
That rate decline would have reduced your monthly 
payment on the car from $751 to $713—roughly a 
5 percent decline. To think about this another way, that 
decrease in payments is roughly equivalent to paying 
$28,500 for the car rather than $30,000. That’s a big 
difference.

rates on auto loans rise, the demand schedule shifts left, and 
the quantity of cars sold drops.
Of course not only car sales are affected by changes in the 
Fed’s interest rate policies. Let’s think about credit cards, 
which consumers use to charge everything from groceries to 
tuition. Some people pay their charges off right away, but 
many others leave balances on their cards for a month or 
more. In fact, as of the end of 2015 U.S. consumers were 
carrying $900 billion in revolving (credit card) debt.
If you have credit card debt, you have to pay interest on it. 
As we will see in the next chapter, credit card companies 
vary the rates they charge according to the creditworthiness 
of borrowers. But on average, credit card rates move up and 
down when the fed funds rate increases or decreases. As a 
result, a decline in the fed funds rate is likely to reduce the 
cost of using your credit card, assuming you don’t pay off all 
of your credit card bills right away. So we could draw a dia-
gram like Figure 12.4 for all goods and services bought with 
credit cards. As interest rates fall, the demand schedule 
shifts to the right, boosting overall sales.
Finally, we come to housing, one of the most important—
and most complicated—markets in the economy. Most peo-
ple buy their homes by borrowing through either a fixed-rate 
or an adjustable-rate mortgage. Interest rates on fixed-rate 
mortgages are tied to long-term interest rates, which are not 
usually directly affected by the Fed. But the interest rate on 
a one-year adjustable mortgage (in which the rate can 
change once every year) moves up and down with the fed 
funds rate. When the fed funds rate heads down, so does the 
one-year mortgage rate. And when the fed funds rate rises, 
so does the one-year mortgage rate. As a result, the Fed can 
directly affect the affordability of housing through mone-
tary policy.
So taking it all together, the fed funds rate affects auto 
sales, retail credit card purchases, and the housing market. 
That explains why cutting the fed funds rate can boost GDP, 
at least in the short run. And it explains why raising the fed 
funds rate has the potential to significantly slow the econ-
omy. When it’s more expensive to borrow, people make 
fewer purchases that require borrowing.
It’s important to note here that monetary stimulus re-
quires about 12 to 18 months for its full effect. These 
monetary policy lags have a big influence on how mone-
tary policy is conducted. For example, if the economy is 
coming out of a recession, the Fed usually needs to start rais-
ing rates before the economy is back to full employment.
Effect of Rate Changes on Inflation
Take another look at Figure 12.4. When interest rates de-
crease, the demand schedule moves to the right. This pushes 
up the price of cars from P to P′ while the quantity de-
manded rises from Q to Q′. That means a price increase is 
associated with a monetary stimulus.
In general, cuts in the fed funds rate put upward pressure 
on prices. Increases in the fed funds rate put downward pres-
sure on prices. However, the exact link between monetary 
policy and inflation depends on the overall economic situa-
tion, just as we saw in Chapter 11 for fiscal policy. Suppose 
actual GDP is below potential GDP and the unemployment 
rate is above the NAIRU (the nonaccelerating inflation rate 
of unemployment). In that case an interest rate cut will likely 
boost output without much fear of triggering inflation.
However, if actual GDP is above potential GDP or if the 
unemployment rate is below the NAIRU, an interest rate cut 
runs the risk of encouraging inflation. That’s a great fear of 
central bankers.
Example: Volcker’s Fight against Inflation
The modern era of monetary policy began when Paul 
­Volcker became chairman of the Federal Reserve in 1979. 
Before that, the people who chaired the Fed did not fully 
understand that running an excessively loose monetary pol-
icy could lead to runaway inflation. Nor did they understand 
that the central bank had prime responsibility for bringing 
down high inflation.
In particular, Arthur Burns, who chaired the Fed from 
1970 to 1978, believed that monetary policy was not an ef-
fective tool against inflation. In 1979, after leaving the Fed, 
he gave a speech called “The Anguish of Central Banking,” 
in which he said,
It is illusory to expect central banks to put an end to the 
inflation that now afflicts the industrial economies . . . 
their practical capacity for curbing an inflation that is 
driven by political forces is very limited.
As a result, when inflation acceler-
ated in the mid-1970s after the oil price 
shock, Burns did not see it as the Fed’s 
role to stamp it out. Instead, he focused 
on cushioning the effects of the reces-
sion on unemployment—a seemingly 
compassionate maneuver that, instead, 
had the effect of letting inflation grow.
IN GENERAL, A CUT IN THE FED FUNDS RATE WILL PUT UPWARD 
PRESSURE ON PRICES, WHILE AN INCREASE IN THE FED FUNDS  
RATE WILL PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES.

Monetary Policy
Volcker came into office with a different perspective: 
that the central bank has not only the power but the re-
sponsibility to reduce inflation. He quickly tightened 
monetary policy, sending interest rates skyrocketing and 
throwing the United States into the short recession of 
1980 and the deep and nasty recession of 1981–1982 (see 
Figure 12.5).
But this shock therapy worked. Inflation, 
which had been running sky-high, plummeted 
faster than almost anyone expected. Core 
­inflation—leaving out food and energy—
dropped from about 12 percent in 1980 to only 
4 percent in 1983. The Fed’s single-minded 
focus on inflation paid big dividends.
Example: Greenspan’s Response 
to the 2001 Recession
Let’s look at an example of how interest rates can be used to 
fight unemployment and boost growth. From 2000 through 
2003, the United States experienced a sharp drop in business 
spending on information technology—the so-called tech 
bust. Over the same stretch, the stock market plummeted be-
cause people realized that the value of some stocks had 
raced too high. The economy was also buffeted by the ter-
rorist attacks of 2001, which destroyed the World Trade 
Center towers in New York.
In response, Greenspan cut the fed funds rate from 
6.5 percent in 2000 to only 1 percent in 2003. Other short-
term interest rates, such as auto loans, followed down as 
well. The point of such low rates was to encourage 
­businesses and consumers to borrow and to keep the econ-
omy going when it was sluggish.
Greenspan succeeded in the sense that the recession 
ended in 2001. The economy grew in every year that fol-
lowed. However, low rates did not help the job market much. 
The unemployment rate kept rising—from 5.3 percent in 
November 2001 to 6.3 percent by July 2003.
Example: Bernanke’s Response 
to the Financial Crisis
As we have described in early chapters, the 
U.S. economy sharply contracted in 2008 and 
2009. The response of Chairman Bernanke and 
the Fed was to rapidly cut the fed funds rate to 
effectively zero, as shown in Figure 12.5.
Unfortunately, the deep financial crisis meant 
that banks were reluctant to lend to consumers 
and businesses, even with the fed funds rate at nearly zero. 
The Fed’s control of short-term rates was not enough to en-
sure recovery. As we will see in the next section, the Fed had 
to develop a new tool to stimulate the economy.

Under ordinary circumstances, the Fed uses control of short-

Quantitative Easing
The Fed had cut the fed funds rate to near zero by the end of 
2008, but the economy kept deteriorating. Despite everything 
the Fed was doing, the unemployment rate continued to rise 
until well into 2009, and then stayed stubbornly high. 
The Fed was facing a tough problem: It couldn’t push 
short-term interest rates any lower than zero. What’s 
more, banks were reluctant to lend to businesses and 
consumers.
In response, the Fed employed a relatively new tool: It 
used open market operations, as described in the previous 
section, to influence long-term interest rates, such as mort-
gage rates, rather than short-term rates. This tool, known as 
quantitative easing (QE), is too complicated to describe 
here in detail. But it had the effect of pumping more money 
into the financial system, even with the fed funds rate at 
close to zero. As one Fed publication wrote: 
From the end of 2008 through October 2014, the 
Federal Reserve greatly expanded its holding of lon-
ger-term securities through open market purchases 
with the goal of putting downward pressure on lon-
ger-term interest rates and thus supporting eco-
nomic activity and job creation by making financial 
conditions more accommodative.
Source: Federal Reserve Bank, “Open Market Operations,”  
www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm
The current use of quantitative easing is unprecedented. 
Some economists worry that it will eventually lead to infla-
tion because so much money is being added to the economy. 
Others worry that long-term interest rates will rise sharply 
once the Fed reverses the quantitative easing. The next few 
years are likely to show whether quantitative easing becomes 
part of the permanent toolkit.  
DIRECT LENDING  When the two planes hit the World 
Trade Center on September 11, 2001, they destroyed the two 
towers and killed almost 3,000 people. The attack also shut 
down Wall Street, the biggest financial center in the world, 
and paralyzed the New York operations of many banks and 
other large financial institutions. The danger: A chain of mas-
sive bankruptcies that could devastate the global financial 
system.
To prevent this economic disaster from happening, the 
Federal Reserve immediately lent banks more than $45 bil-
lion to make sure they didn’t run out of money. In fact, no 
banks failed in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, and the 
economy kept functioning.
The response to the 9/11 attacks illustrates a crucial role 
of the central bank: to serve as the ultimate safeguard for the 
financial system when an unexpected crisis hits. To accom-
plish this role, the Fed can lend vulnerable financial institu-
tions as much money as they need—money that’s backed by 
the full faith and credit of the federal government. This usu-
ally ensures that banks and other financial institutions will 
have enough money to meet their financial obligations to 
depositors or to any other creditors.
To provide money to struggling financial institutions, the 
Fed has historically used a monetary policy tool called the 
discount window. (Although this isn’t what actually hap-
pens, you can think of bank executives lined up at a teller’s 
window.) In fact, a few hours after the ­September 11, 2001, 
terrorist attacks, the Fed announced, “The Federal Reserve 
System is open and operating. The discount window is avail-
able to meet liquidity needs.”
The purpose of the discount window is to give financial 
institutions access to funds if they run short. To use the 
discount window, a bank would come to the Fed and ask to 
borrow money. It would then be charged the discount rate. 
The Fed usually sets the discount rate for banks 3/4 to 1 per-
centage point higher than the fed funds rate and adjusts them 
both at the same time. (The bank also has to put up collateral 
to prove that it can pay back the loan.) Under normal cir-
cumstances, the use of the discount window is usually 
viewed as a sign that a bank is mismanaged, so banks are 
reluctant to use it. But in a financial crisis it is an indispens-
able tool for getting money into the financial ­system quickly.
Example: The Fed’s Response to the 
2007–2009 Financial Crisis
In 2007, the housing boom turned to bust—in part because 
too many homes had been built and because too many loans 
had been made to borrowers with low incomes or bad credit 
histories—the so-called subprime mortgages. Home prices 
started to plunge, and many people with subprime mort-
gages couldn’t afford to pay them back. The falling housing 
prices meant that residential construction dropped sharply. 
Homeowners also had to cut back on 
their spending because they could no 
longer easily borrow against the value 
of their homes.
The Fed addressed these problems 
by cutting the fed funds rate from 
5.25 percent in summer 2007 to 2.0 per-
cent by April 2008. That helped the 
economy by making borrowing cheaper.
But interest rate cuts weren’t enough. 
As people started to have trouble paying 
back their loans, banks and other large 
financial institutions began reporting big 
losses. People feared that the troubles 
would spread and that a big bank might 
fail. There was an enormous amount of 
worry in the financial markets.
In response, Fed Chairman Ben 
­Bernanke opened the discount window 
by encouraging financial institutions to 
borrow from the Fed as needed. But the 
discount window, in its usual form, was

not enough to deal with the developing 
financial crisis either.
So the Fed came up with several 
new ways to lend to financial institu-
tions, with complicated names like the 
term auction facility (TAF), the pri-
mary dealer credit facility (PDCF), the 
money market investor funding facility 
(MMIFF), and the term securities lend-
ing facility (TSLF). With one excep-
tion, these new ways of lending were 
all closed down by 2010 after the crisis 
subsided (so you don’t have to the re-
member the names). But while they 
were in place, they enabled the Fed to 
get financially stressed banks and other 
financial institutions the funds they 
needed to stay afloat. Figure 12.6 
shows the total of all the crisis-related 
lending by the Fed, which peaked at 
about $1.6 trillion at the end of 2008.
The Reserve Requirement and  
Other Regulations
Increasingly over time, the Federal Reserve has taken the 
lead role in setting the regulations by which financial institu-
tions can borrow and lend. By tweaking these, the Fed can 
exert control over the economy.
Three important regulations that the Fed controls are the 
reserve requirement, the interest on reserves, and the margin 
requirement. Remember from earlier in this chapter that 
banks have to keep a portion of their deposits either in cash 
in their vaults or on reserve with the Fed. For most banks, 
this reserve requirement is 10 percent of deposits (it’s less 
for smaller banks).
In theory, the Fed can exert influence over bank lending 
by controlling the reserve requirement. The more money 
they have to keep on reserve, the less money banks have 
available to lend. Less lending by banks means less spend-
ing by borrowers, which helps slow the economy. Alterna-
tively, cutting the reserve requirement could give an extra 
boost to borrowing and lending.
The Fed also controls the interest rate on reserves that it 
pays banks. This is a new policy tool, so it’s not clear how it 
will work in practice. However, cutting the rate on reserves 
should make banks more willing to use their funds for 
lending. 
The margin requirement determines how much people 
can borrow when they buy stock. The higher the margin re-
quirement (now at 50 percent for most stock purchases), the 
higher the percentage of cash down payment a purchaser 
must make when borrowing to buy securities. Raising the 
margin requirement makes it harder for investors to buy 
stock, and this has the effect of holding down the stock 
market.
However, changing either the reserve requirement 
or the margin requirement is a blunt tool for monetary

Fighting the Financial Crisis: The Fed Extends Credit to the United States 
and the World, 2007–2010
To fight the financial crisis, the 
Fed lent dollars to a wide variety 
of financial institutions, both in 
the United States and abroad. In 
addition, the Fed provided other 
central banks with dollars to 
help stem the crisis in other 
countries. The amount outstand-
ing peaked at about $1.6 trillion 
at the end of 2008. (The figure

ing programs, and lending to

policy that the Fed rarely uses. For example, 
the last time the Fed changed the reserve

are always available, though, if the Fed 
needs them.
THE PRACTICE OF 
MONETARY POLICY  LO12-6 
Some other important issues come up around monetary pol-
icy. These include how soon to raise rates after a deep reces-
sion, how monetary policy compares to fiscal policy, the 
debate over rules versus discretion, and the question of what 
monetary policy can do over the long term.
How Soon Should Rates Be Increased?
As this textbook is being revised in mid-2016, the fed funds 
rate has been near zero for about eight years. The Federal 
Reserve, led by Chair Janet Yellen, has lifted the fed funds 
rate once over that period, in December 2015, 
by a mere 0.25 percentage point. The issue is 
how soon to raise the fed funds rate back to a 
“normal” level of 4 or 5 percent. 
On the one hand, if the Fed lifts rates too 
soon, it risks choking off the U.S. recovery. On 
the other hand, if the Fed waits too long to lift 
rates, it risks triggering inflation or another bub-
ble in the housing market or in the stock market 
(see Spotlight: The Fed’s Biggest Mistakes.)
That’s why the Fed pays such close attention to the eco-
nomic data, attempting to understand how strong the economy 
is and whether another bubble is developing. We won’t know 
until afterward whether the Fed has made the right decision.  
Monetary versus Fiscal Policy
What are the similarities and differences between monetary 
and fiscal policy? Both can speed up or slow down the econ-
omy. The Fed can cut or raise rates, and Congress can boost 
or cut spending, or cut or raise taxes.
MONETARY POLICY IS MORE FLEXIBLE AND LESS POLITICAL THAN 
FISCAL POLICY.
SPOTLIGHT: THE FED’S BIGGEST MISTAKES
One problem with being the most powerful economic 
agency in the world is that when you make a mistake, it’s  
a big one. The Fed’s first mistake came during the Great 
­Depression, the first major crisis the Fed faced. After the 
initial stock market crash in October 1929, the Fed loos-
ened monetary policy, which was the right thing to do. By 
1931, when the economy was just starting to recover, the 
Fed decided it would be a good idea to raise interest 
rates. The tightening continued on and off until 1933, 
helping contribute to an enormous number of bank fail-
ures and a widespread industrial collapse.
	
From this mistake, the Fed learned its first important 
lesson: Don’t raise interest rates when the economy is 
­collapsing. In the 1970s, however, the Fed made the 
­opposite error. We saw in Chapter 10 how the oil price 
shock of 1973 helped create a deep recession. When that 
happened, the Fed cut rates, which was the right thing to 
do. However, it then made the mistake of keeping rates 
too low for too long after the recession was over. That 
­fueled a tremendous surge in inflation. So the Fed’s second 
lesson was this: Don’t cut interest rates when inflation is 
accelerating. Finally, many economists argue that the 
­Federal Reserve made a big mistake by keeping short-
term interest rates too low for too long after the 2001 
­recession. This enabled a bubble to develop in the housing 
market and set the stage for the financial crisis.
Fed mistakes contributed to bank failures in the 
Great Depression.

CH 12 
Monetary Policy
But several differences favor mone-
tary policy as a tool when it comes to 
fighting inflation or smoothing out the 
business cycle. In particular, monetary 
policy is both more flexible and less 
political than fiscal policy. First, the 
Fed can act more quickly than Con-
gress and the president because it 
doesn’t have to go through the lengthy 
political process of passing legislation. 
In fact, if the need is great enough, the 
top decision makers at the Fed can raise or lower interest 
rates with just a telephone conference.
A second advantage is that the Fed, when it does act, 
can take action in baby steps. That means it can cut or raise 
rates a little bit at a time and see how the economy reacts 
before it goes further. Between June 2004 and June 2006, 
for example, the Fed raised interest rates 17 times, each 
time by a quarter of a percentage point. In contrast, Con-
gress has to expend so much political energy to pass a big 
tax or spending bill that it can be done just once a year (or 
sometimes not at all). That makes monetary policy much 
more flexible than fiscal policy.
Finally, when the economy recovers from a downturn, the 
Fed can take back a monetary stimulus more easily than 
Congress can take back a tax cut or added spending. Think 
about it: When the Fed raises interest rates, making borrow-
ing more expensive, people may complain. But the chair of 
the Fed is not going to be fired because of that. In compari-
son, if a member of Congress votes to take back a tax cut, 
she can be sure her next election opponent will accuse her of 
having voted for a tax increase.
Discretion versus Rules
Economists now generally agree that central banks should 
focus on inflation. But there is still debate about whether the 
Fed should use a rules-based approach or an approach based 
on discretionary intervention. A rules-based approach does 
exactly what it says: It lays out a set of rules that clearly de-
scribe ahead of time what policies the Fed should follow, 
based on the state of the economy.
One example of a rules-based approach is inflation 
­targeting. Inflation targeting says the Fed should publicly 
announce its inflation target—perhaps around 2 percent—
and then commit itself to running monetary policy to hit that 
target. Both Bernanke and Yellen have been supporters of 
inflation targeting.
In contrast, the prime advocate of discretionary interven-
tion was Alan Greenspan, who preceded Bernanke and 
­Yellen as Fed chair. Greenspan believed that as the economy 
changed, monetary policy needed to adjust as well.
The clearest example of Greenspan’s discretionary inter-
vention came in 1996. That year the unemployment rate 
dropped below 5.5 percent, the level most economic 
­forecasters had previously pegged as the NAIRU. Based on 
historical evidence, the right move for the Fed would have 
been to start raising rates to avoid an inflationary surge.
However, there was no sign of inflation accelerating, 
which puzzled the members of the FOMC. The minutes of 
their August 1996 meeting reported,
Increases in prices had remained remarkably sub-
dued for an extended period in relation to measures 
of resource utilization, notably the rate of unemploy-
ment. Such behavior differed markedly from the his-
torical experience under similar circumstances. 
Meanwhile Chairman Alan Greenspan was giving 
speeches arguing that the economy was in the early stages of 
a productivity revival—the so-called New Economy. This 
productivity revival would enable the economy to grow 
faster without igniting inflation. As a result, Greenspan 
­advocated holding back on interest rate increases.
In fact, the Fed did not seriously start tightening mone-
tary policy with rate increases until 2000, as we saw in Fig-
ure 12.5. This was one case in which the usual rules-based 
approach would have cut off the boom of the second half of 
the 1990s well before it was necessary.
Long-Term Effects of Monetary Policy
So far, we’ve been discussing the short-term impacts of 
monetary policy. Can Fed actions have any long-term im-
pact on unemployment and growth? Can the Fed lower the 
NAIRU or raise the long-term potential rate of growth?
Economists generally agree that monetary policy affects 
the long-term rate of inflation but has little direct effect, 
over the long term, on the rate of unemployment or the po-
tential rate of growth. That is, if the Fed stimulates the econ-
omy in an attempt to keep unemployment below the NAIRU 
or actual GDP above potential GDP over the long term, the 
main result will be accelerating inflation. Workers will push 
up wages and businesses will push up prices, potentially 
leading to a wage–price spiral.
The best way to improve long-term growth has nothing to 
do with the Fed. Instead, the country has to invest in physi-
cal and human capital and in the creation of knowledge, as 
we saw in Chapter 9. These sorts of investments can help cut 
unemployment as well because firms that are growing and 
succeeding can hire plenty of workers and keep them 
employed.
However, there are two indirect pathways by which effec-
tive monetary policy can improve long-term outcomes. Low 
inflation makes the future more predictable, making it easier 
for businesses and individuals to plan and make good deci-
sions. That tends to improve growth and employment in the 
long run. So if the Fed can hold inflation to around 2 percent 
or so, that’s a plus for long-term growth.
In addition, if the Fed does a good job of smoothing 
out the business cycle, recessions will be few and mild. 
That makes it easier for businesses to take more risks in 
terms of investing in new technologies and opening up

new business lines. In other words, the Fed’s best long-
term contribution to the economy is to manage it well by 
minimizing its ups and downs rather than stimulating it 
excessively.
CONCLUSION
The U.S. Federal Reserve was founded in 1913. Since that 
time, economists have become much more adept at using 
monetary policy to accomplish important goals, such as 
­controlling inflation, smoothing out the business cycle, and 
ensuring financial stability. Most recently, to deal with the 
financial crisis, the Fed had to find new ways of getting 
funds to vulnerable financial institutions.
But the economy is still evolving. In the next three chap-
ters, we will explore the key driving forces for change in to-
day’s world: financial markets, international trade, and 
technological change.

SUMMARY
	 1.	Money includes currency as well as the contents of 
checking and savings accounts. Money serves three 
purposes: a medium of exchange, a store of value, 
and a standard of value. (LO12-1)
	 2.	The Federal Reserve was set up to support the fi-
nancial system when things go bad. It was given the 
power to issue currency and set key interest rates—
the first time a government agency was given such 
strong tools for directly influencing the economy. 
(LO12-2)
	 3.	The goals of monetary policy include controlling infla-
tion, smoothing out the business cycle, and ensuring 
financial stability. To accomplish these goals, the Fed 
has several policy tools, including control over short-
term interest rates, quantitative easing, direct lending 
to financial institutions, and changes in reserve re-
quirements and other financial regulations. (LO12-3)
	 4.	The main interest rate that the Fed controls is the fed 
funds rate, using open market operations. Changes in 
the fed funds rate influence other short-term interest 
rates, such as the interest rates on auto loans, credit 
card debt, and adjustable-rate mortgages. (LO12-4)
	 5.	The Fed uses its control over short-term interest rates 
to fight inflation and smooth out the business cycle. 
When the fed funds rate is cut, that encourages bor-
rowing and spending in the economy and puts upward 
pressure on prices. An increase in the fed funds rate 
discourages borrowing and spending in the economy 
and puts downward pressure on prices. (LO12-4)
	 6.	The Fed’s prime weapon against a financial crisis is its 
ability to lend vulnerable financial institutions as much 
money as they need. To do this, it uses the discount 
window. During the financial crisis, the Fed created 
several new ways to lend money to hard-pressed 
banks and Wall Street firms. The Fed also has the 
power to change the reserve requirement, the interest 
rate on ­reserves, and margin requirement, but it has 
not used that power recently. (LO12-5)
	 7.	The advantages of monetary policy over fiscal policy 
as a tool for influencing the economy are that mone-
tary policy is more flexible and less political. The Fed 
can react more quickly, take action in small steps to 
see how the economy reacts, and change direction if 
needed. (LO12-6)

DELVING DEEPER INTO 
MACROECONOMICS
AGGREGATE DEMAND 
AND AGGREGATE  
SUPPLY  LO12A-1 
So far in this textbook, we’ve used supply and 
demand diagrams to analyze individual mar-
kets. But economists also use supply and demand diagrams 
to think about the whole economy. In particular, we talk 
about aggregate demand and aggregate supply.
Aggregate Demand
Aggregate demand is the sum of the quantities demanded 
from the different sectors of the economy: personal con-
sumption (C), nonresidential investment (NR), residential 
investment (R), government consumption and investment 
(G), change in private inventories (I), and net exports (NX). 
These are the same sectors that make 
up gross domestic product, as we saw 
in Chapter 7, but now we have given 
them labels. The value of net exports, 
for example, is NX.
The equation for aggregate demand 
(AD) is, therefore:
AD = C + NR + R + G + I + NX
The aggregate demand curve links 
the average price level of the whole 
economy with the aggregate quantity 
demanded. Obviously, as we’ve seen in 
earlier chapters, both the price level and output 
are almost always rising over time. Thus, we 
can think of the aggregate demand curve as 
a  snapshot of the economy at a particular 
moment.
The aggregate demand curve is downward-
sloping (see Figure 12A.1), which means that a 
higher overall price level means a lower quantity demanded 
by consumers, businesses, and government. This seems to

make sense: We’ve seen over and over again in this textbook 
that in individual markets, higher prices mean lower quanti-
ties demanded.
But the aggregate demand curve really doesn’t work the 
same way as a market demand curve, even though it looks 
similar. The difference is that aggregate demand takes into 
account the price level for the entire economy. If that price 
level is higher, all prices are higher on average, including 
wages. Thus, while the price of a restaurant meal may have 
gone up by 10 percent, your wages have gone up by 10 per-
cent, too—so that increase wouldn’t stop you from buying 
a meal.
Economists have, instead, identified several other rea-
sons a higher price level means less aggregate quantity de-
manded. Two of these are the wealth effect and the interest 
rate effect. First is the wealth effect: If prices are higher, 
the cash in your pocket and your bank account is worth less. 
In other words, your real wealth (adjusted for prices) drops. 
If prices are lower, the cash in your pocket and your bank 
account is worth more. For example, if you have a $10 bill, 
and the price of a cup of coffee falls from $2 to $1 per cup, 
you can buy 10 cups with that money instead of only 
5 cups. So, a lower price level means that the buying power 
of your wealth increases, which in turn leads to more 
consumption.
Second, rising prices also boost interest rates, and higher 
interest rates hold down business investment, residential 
construction, and consumer spending on things like automo-
biles, which are usually bought on credit. The link between 
prices and interest rates runs something like this: If prices 
are higher, you need to keep more cash on hand and in your 
checking account to pay your month-to-month bills. But 
that’s money you can’t deposit in your savings account, so 
it’s not available for banks to lend out. With less money to 
lend out, the supply curve for loans moves to the left, and 
interest rates rise. This is the interest rate effect.
Aggregate Supply
Aggregate supply is the quantity of goods and services that 
the economy produces. Now let’s look at the aggregate 
­supply curve, which links the average price level of the 
economy with the aggregate quantity of goods and services 
produced. As in the case of the aggregate demand curve, we 
can think of the aggregate supply curve as a snapshot of the 
economy at a particular moment. In the long term, when 
prices rise, so do wages and all the other costs of production, 
such as rent and the costs of materials. From the perspective 
of a business, then, nothing much has changed—higher 
prices are balanced by higher costs. As a result, in the long 
run, a rise in the overall price level does not change the 
quantity supplied, so the long-term aggregate supply curve 
is vertical—that is, suppliers produce the same amount no 
matter what the price level is.
Here’s another way to think about the long-term aggre-
gate supply curve. In the language of Chapter 10, long-term 
aggregate supply Q at any moment is 
the same as potential GDP at that mo-
ment. Potential GDP does not depend 
on the price level—rather, it reflects 
the economy’s sustainable productive 
capacity.
However, the short-term aggregate 
supply curve is upward-sloping. If 
prices rise, it takes time for wages and 
other input prices to react. Here’s one 
way to think about this: In most busi-
nesses, salaries and wages are adjusted 
only once a year (and if there’s a union 
and a signed labor contract, it may be 
several years before the contract ex-
pires). In other words, wages are 
sticky, meaning that they don’t change 
right away.
So there’s a period—after prices 
start to rise, and before wages re-
spond—when labor gets relatively 
cheaper. During that period, a business 
can make more money by hiring addi-
tional workers and expanding. As a re-
sult, in the short run, businesses will 
boost their production in response to 
an increase in the overall price level. 
You can interpret this as real GDP 
temporarily exceeding potential GDP.
But, over time, wages catch up with 
prices, and the economy returns to the 
long-run aggregate supply curve. Fig-
ure 12A.2 shows both the short-term 
and long-term aggregate supply curves.
Long-Term Aggregate 
Equilibrium
In Figure 12A.3, the long-term aggre-
gate equilibrium occurs at the point 
where long-term aggregate quantity 
supplied is equal to aggregate quantity 
demanded—that is, where the aggre-
gate supply and demand curves cross. 
That gives us an equilibrium price level 
P for the economy and an equilibrium 
output Q.
In aggregate equilibrium, demand is 
just strong enough to get the maximum 
output from businesses without creating 
upward pressure on prices. An economy 
at long-term aggregate equilibrium is, 
therefore, on the path of ­potential GDP, 
where there are no strains on production 
or unused resources.

REACTING TO EVENTS  LO12A-2 
The whole point of developing 
the aggregate supply–­aggregate 
demand framework is to under-
stand what happens when the 
economy is hit by a big event, 
like a sharp rise in oil prices, a 
fall in housing prices, or a ter-
rorist attack. We can also use 
the aggregate supply–demand 
framework to ­assess the impact 
of different government policy actions.
Shifts in Aggregate Supply
Let’s look first at events that cause a shift in aggregate 
­supply—that is, a movement of the aggregate supply curve 
either left or right. The clearest example of a shift to the left 
is a terrorist attack that forces businesses and government to 
divert resources—money and people—to increased security. 
Every extra person working as a security guard or guarding 
the border is one less person available for productive work in 
a factory or an office. Every dollar put into security cameras 
is not available for new machinery and computers.
These resources are not available for production, which 
causes the long-term aggregate supply curve to shift to the left, 
as in Figure 12A.4. The result is that equilibrium output falls 
FIGURE 12A.3 
Aggregate Demand  
and Supply
The aggregate demand curve is downward-sloping, and the 
long-term aggregate supply curve is vertical. The equilibrium 
price P and output Q are shown at the point where the 
­aggregate supply and demand curves intersect.

A Decline in Aggregate Supply
An increase in antiterrorist security measures shifts aggregate

up the price level, increasing inflation.

time, however, output falls back to Q, which can be inter-
preted as a return to the path of potential GDP.

from Q to Q′. This decline can be interpreted as a reduction of 
potential output, which has the effect of slowing growth.
At the same time, all else being equal, the price level rises 
from P to P′. This can be interpreted as faster inflation 
­because the price level takes an extra bump up. In other 
words, anything that reduces the level of potential output 
pushes up inflation (by raising the general price level), 
which in turn holds down output and slows growth.
We would draw a similar diagram to illustrate the impact 
of rising oil prices, of the kind we saw in 2007 and 2008. 
The United States buys two-thirds of its oil consumption 
from overseas. So, as the price of oil rises, the amount that 
the United States has to pay oil-exporting countries goes up. 
That leaves less money to invest in new equipment at home. 
What’s more, some pieces of equipment that use a lot of 
­energy may be unprofitable to use with fuel prices so high. 
That’s why airlines cut back on their flights and took certain 
aircraft out of service.
As a result, rising oil prices cause the aggregate supply 
curve to shift to the left (similar to Figure 12A.4). That gives 
us what is known as stagflation—the combination of slow 
growth and inflation that we last saw in the 1970s. The 
­bigger the rise in oil prices, the further that the aggregate 
supply curve shifts to the left. That means a bigger rise in 
overall prices and a deeper slowdown in growth.
Conversely, falling energy prices cause the aggregate 
supply curve to shift to the right. That boosts growth, while 
keeping inflation low. Part of the recovery since the finan-
cial crisis has been fueled by a deep decline in the price of 
energy as new techniques were developed to locate and pro-
duce oil and natural gas, as described in Chapter 15 and 
Chapter 19.
Another change that has increased the level of potential 
output and shifted the aggregate supply curve to the right is 
the information revolution, described in Chapter 15. 
Broader use of computers, the Internet, and mobile com-
munications has led to an increase in productivity as more 
and more businesses integrated information technology into 
their operatios. This is illustrated in Figure 12A.5. As the 
aggregate supply curve shifts to the right, equilibrium output 
increases from Q to Q′, which can be interpreted as an 
­upward boost to potential output, increasing the growth rate.
Figure 12A.5 also shows a drop in the price level from P 
to P′. This does not indicate actual deflation, but rather 
should be seen as a slowing of the inflation rate. This is what 
happened in the second half of the 1990s—rapid growth 
without inflation, or the opposite of stagflation.
There might be other reasons the aggregate supply curve 
shifts to the right. Any significant technological change 
can increase aggregate supply. And many economists be-
lieve that cuts in marginal tax rates can increase the incen-
tives to work and invest (as discussed in Chapter 11). That 
would increase output and produce a diagram much like 
Figure 12A.5. However, there is great disagreement about 
how big an impact a marginal tax cut might have.
Shifts in Aggregate Demand
Many of the events that have hit the economy in recent 
years have affected the aggregate demand curve rather than 
the aggregate supply curve. Consider the financial crisis of 
2007–2009. As home prices dropped, many households 
saw a large part of their personal wealth evaporate. What’s 
more, it became harder for households to take out home 
equity loans because their homes were worth less and 
banks were more reluctant to lend. And falling home prices 
meant a lot less construction of new homes by builders.
The result is lower personal consumption (C) and resi-
dential investment (R)—and because personal consumption 
and residential investment are both components of aggre-
gate ­demand, that means the aggregate demand curve shifts 
to the left.
Take a look at Figure 12A.6. The first thing that happens 
when aggregate demand falls is that the equilibrium shifts 
from point A to point B along the short-term aggregate sup-
ply curve. Assuming nothing else changes, demand falls, 
the average price level decreases from P to P′, and busi-
nesses drop their output from Q to Q′ because they are less 
profitable. They hire fewer workers, 
the unemployment rate rises, and 
growth slows.
But over time, sticky wages and in-
put prices fall along along with the 
FIGURE 12A.5 
An Increase in Aggregate 
Supply
The information revolution shifted long-term aggregate  
supply to the right. That increased potential output at any  
moment, boosting growth. It also pushed down the price 
level, reducing inflation.

overall price level. Business profitability goes up because 
firms are paying lower wages, so they hire more workers. 
The result is that output (and the unemployment rate) returns 
to the original level of Q. This can be interpreted as a return 
to the path of potential GDP. But the price level P″ is now 
much lower than the original price level P.
The implication is that the fall in housing prices leads to 
slow growth and to less inflation, with the economy eventually 
recovering, which means a return to the path of potential GDP. 
What about events that increase aggregate demand? For 
example, in the second half of the 1990s, the information 
revolution caused businesses to spend heavily on informa-
tion technology, boosting nonresidential investment (NR) 
and lifting aggregate demand. The housing boom that ran 
until 2006 stimulated both personal consumption and resi-
dential investment. 
Aggregate demand can also be increased by government 
intervention. Using fiscal and monetary policy, as described 
in Chapters 11 and 12, government policymakers can increase 
demand by cutting interest rates, cutting taxes, or boosting 
government spending. For example, President Obama’s fiscal 
stimulus package of 2009 created jobs and put money into the 
pockets of Americans, much of which they spent.
Let’s see how we would represent a fiscal stimulus on an 
aggregate supply—aggregate demand diagram. Take a look 
at Figure 12A.7. The first thing that happens when aggregate 
demand rises is that the equilibrium shifts from point A to 
point B. Demand increases, the average price level increases 
from P to P′, and businesses boost their output from Q to Q′ 
because it’s profitable for them to do so. They hire more 
workers, and the unemployment rate falls.
But then wages rise, catching up to prices. Employers lay 
off some of their additional workers or cut back on hours. 
Output falls back from Q′ to the original Q, returning back 
to potential GDP, and a higher price level, P″. That’s a sign 
of potential inflation.
We can draw two conclusions from this analysis. First, 
attempts by the government to stimulate the economy and 
boost output above its long-term equilibrium level may 
­succeed temporarily. In the long run, however, the main out-
come of government stimulation is to increase prices 
(and inflation). In other words, there is no sustainable way to 
drive unemployment down below its natural rate.
The second conclusion, though, is more optimistic. 
­Suppose the economy suffered a negative demand shock, 
such as turmoil in the financial markets that made it hard for 
people to get mortgage loans. Then policies designed to 
stimulate demand—such as cutting interest rates, cutting 
taxes, or boosting government spending—could get the 
economy back to long-term equilibrium faster. 
FIGURE 12A.6 
A Decrease in Aggregate 
Demand
An event such as the housing bust shifts aggregate demand 
to the left. In the short run, the equilibrium moves from point 
A to point B, slowing growth. In the absence of any other 
negative shocks, the equilibrium would eventually move to C, 
on the long-term potential growth path but with lower levels 
of inflation.

	 1.	Aggregate demand is the sum of the quantities de-
manded from the sectors of the economy. The aggre-
gate demand curve links the average price level of 
the whole economy with the aggregate quantity 
­demanded. (LO12A-1)
	 2.	The aggregate supply curve links the average price 
level of the economy with the quantity of goods and 
services produced. The long-term aggregate supply 
curve is vertical, meaning that price changes have no 
effect on the quantity produced. The short-term ag-
gregate supply curve is upward-sloping because price 
increases will induce businesses to produce more and 
hire more workers. (LO12A-1)
	 3.	A shift of the long-term aggregate supply curve to the 
left will reduce output and boost the price level. This 
can be interpreted as a reduction in potential GDP 
and an increase in the inflation rate. A shift in the long-
term aggregate supply curve to the right will increase 
output and hold down the price level. This can be in-
terpreted as an increase in potential GDP and a de-
cline in inflation. (LO12A-2)
	 4.	In the short run, a rightward shift in aggregate demand—
say, because the government boosts spending—will in-
crease output and prices. This can be interpreted as a 
boost to growth and inflation. In the long run, output will 
fall back to the long-term aggregate supply curve, but 
the average price level will remain higher. (LO12A-2)

e)	 Based on your answers to (a) through (d), did the financial crisis raise the equilibrium price level, 
lower the equilibrium price level, or have an ambiguous effect?

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After reading this chapter, you should be able to:
LO13-1	
Discuss the demand and supply 
curves for loans, and list some factors 
affecting interest rates.
LO13-2	
Explain the role of a financial 
intermediary, and discuss how banks 
work.
LO13-3	
Describe the risk-return principle, and 
explain how it applies to the stock 
market.
LO13-4	
Review the benefits of the diversity of 
financial intermediaries.
LO13-5	
Summarize the key causes of the 
financial crisis.
the same microeconomics tools we’ve 
used already in this book. We will review 
some basics of borrowing and lending. 
Then we’ll introduce the important ideas 
of financial intermediaries, the risk–return 
principle, and diversification. (Don’t worry! 
We’ll explain all these terms.) Along the 
way, we’ll describe some key institutions 
of the financial markets, such as the stock 
market and the bond market. We’ll also 
explain how financial markets can go 
wrong, what happened in the 2007–2009 
financial crisis, and how regulations were 
tightened to reduce the chances of a 
­similar event happening. 
T
he first half of this textbook explored 
the basics of microeconomics and 
macroeconomics. Now we shift gears and 
focus on critical trends driving the econ-
omy into the future. This chapter and the 
next two will cover financial markets, tech-
nology, and globalization. The ups and 
downs of the stock market and other 
­financial markets; the rapid growth of 
technology companies such as Google, 
Facebook, Amazon, and Apple; and the 
huge volume of trade with countries such 
as China and India are economic events 
that influence each of our lives.
	
In this chapter, we will take a good look 
at financial markets. Over the past 25 years, 
the financial markets and the busi-
nesses that participate in them—including 
high-profile financial institutions such as 
JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs—
have taken an increasingly central role 
in  our economy. More and more, the 
­financial markets influence where we live, 
what we drive, and what our retirement 
will look like.

THE MARKET FOR LOANS  LO13-1 
In earlier chapters, we looked at simple lending and borrow-
ing. Let’s quickly review some terms and define some new 
ones. In any loan, a lender gives a borrower a sum of money 
called the principal. The price of the loan is its ­interest rate, 
which says how much the borrower has to pay 
the lender in exchange for the use of the money. 
For example, if the annual interest rate is 
5 percent, the borrower has to pay the lender 
5 percent of the principal in exchange for bor-
rowing the money for a year. After some period 
of time, the borrower repays the principal to the 
lender, in ­addition to the interest already paid. 
The length of a loan is called its term.
Suppose a real estate developer wants to 
make money by building and selling some new 
houses in a previously rural area. Before she 
can sell the homes, the developer has to lay out a lot of 
money buying farmland, clearing the land with bulldozers, 
putting in the infrastructure (electricity, water, roads, sewer 
system), and actually building the homes. The process might 
take $3 million and a year or more.
Rather than taking this money out of her own pocket, the 
developer takes out a $3 million loan from a local bank—
say, at a 5 percent interest rate—to finance the construction. 
A year later, she’s built and sold the homes and has made 
enough money to repay the $3 million principal to the bank. 
In addition, she has to pay the bank 5 percent interest on the 
$3 million, which amounts to $150,000. So, in total, she 
pays the bank $3,150,000.
Because the borrower is actually a type of buyer who pays 
the lender—the seller—for the use of the principal for some 
length of time, we can think about this 
transaction in terms of the supply–­
demand framework we developed in 
Chapters 2 and 3. The interest rate is the 
price of using the money. The higher 
the interest rate, the higher the price.
Why Borrow?
Before we go further in our examina-
tion of the market for loans, let’s ask a 
simple question: Why borrow? Most 
typical households don’t have enough 
cash on hand to afford the cars, the 
homes, the college educations, or the 
vacations they want. In theory, they can 
save until they have enough money to 
pay cash, though that could take a 
while. Or they can borrow the money 
now and pay it back over time, either by 
taking out loans or by charging the pur-
chases on their credit cards (this is just 
like taking out a loan from the credit card company, only 
usually at a higher interest rate than you would pay at a 
bank). About three of every four U.S. families have some 
debt. The biggest single type of debt by far is mortgage debt, 
used to buy homes.
When businesses borrow, their typical goal is to finance 
their expansion—another building, more ma-
chines, more workers. An airline, for example, 
might borrow money to buy more planes or 
spare parts. A doctor’s office might take out a 
loan to finance a new computer system. An 
electric utility might borrow to build a new 
power plant. These are all future-oriented 
­activities intended to bring in profits over the 
long term, as opposed to buying supplies for 
immediate use. (See Table 13.1 for some com-
mon types of loans.)

a lender gives a

SPOTLIGHT: ONE FAMILY’S 
LOANS
In 2008, we looked at Andrea Simmons and David 
­Telep, a typical married couple living in the small town 
of East Hampton, CT, with a typical amount of debt. 
When they bought their house in 1991, it cost them 
$130,000. Still, said David, who worked as a school-
teacher, the couple had to borrow $105,000 in order  
to afford the home. In 2008, they were paying a  
4.75 percent interest rate on the mortgage, which  
they expected to have paid off in 2018.
	
Andrea and David had some other loans outstanding 
as well. For example, “we borrowed to buy a used sail-
boat in 2002,” said David. That cost them about $8,000, 
but it enabled them to go sailing and vacationing with 
their three boys (aged 17, 15, and 11 in 2008). The next 
big question, of course: How much to borrow to pay for 
college? 
	
Update: We checked in with David in June 2016, 
and things are going well. “I paid off the mortgage in 
December,” he said, earlier than expected. Now the 
mortgage payment goes into retirement savings. He 
plans to retire in seven years, at age 65.
	
His oldest son received merit-based aid from the 
University of Connecticut and also lived at home for 
portions of his college years, so he was able to  
graduate without any student loan debt.
	
David’s youngest son plans to attend a community 
college in fall 2016 to enter an engineering program 
that will transfer to UConn, while his middle son is still 
deciding what to do. Said David: “One of our commit-
ments is to have them graduate without much, if any, 
student debt.”

The ability to borrow is important for healthy market 
economies. Without borrowing, there would be many 
fewer new businesses because potential entrepreneurs 
would have to save all the necessary money before their 
ideas could even get off the ground. Airlines could not buy 
new planes unless they had millions of dollars in cash to 
pay for them (which they almost never do). JetBlue, an 
airline that started flying in 2000, borrowed hundreds of 
millions of dollars to buy planes. Trucking companies 
generally take out loans to pay for their fleets. And most 
office buildings, warehouses, and factories would not be 
constructed without borrowed money. In fact, the flow of 
borrowed funds nourishes productive capacity in every 
part of the economy.
The Demand Curve for Loans
Interest rates matter. The willingness of consumers and busi-
nesses to borrow rises as the interest rate falls—that is, the 
law of demand holds for loans. If the interest rate is low, 
both businesses and consumers are more likely to take on 
debt. But if the interest rate rises, the quantity of loans 
­demanded will fall.
For example, the real estate developer in our previous ex-
ample has to pay interest on the money she borrows to pay 
for the land and the construction. If a bank is willing to lend 
her the money to buy the land at only 1 percent interest per 
year, she’ll probably have the bulldozers roaring tomorrow. 
But if the interest rate is 10 percent per year, she’ll be paying 
10 times as much interest, and the loan to buy the land looks 
much less attractive.
Table 13.2 illustrates in more detail how higher interest 
rates can discourage borrowing. As before, it costs the 
­developer $3 million to buy the land and construct the 
homes. As a result, she needs a $3 million loan. She hopes to 
sell the homes for $3.2 million, which will generate a 
$200,000 gain ($3.2 million minus her $3 million costs).
But wait! The developer also has to pay interest on the 
loan. If the interest rate is 1 percent, as shown in the first 
­column of Table 13.2, her interest payment is $30,000 (1 percent 
of $3 million). That gives her a net profit of $170,000, so it 
makes sense to take out the loan.
Now take a look at the second column, where the interest 
rate is 5 percent. The interest payments are higher, and the 
net profit is lower. Still, the developer will go ahead.
But if the interest rate is 10 percent, as shown in the third 
column of the table, the interest payment is $300,000. Even 
after earning revenue of $3.2 million, her total costs have 
gone up to $3.3 million, and she actually makes a net loss of 
$100,000 on the deal. So being a smart entrepreneur, she 
doesn’t take out the loan or build the homes. As others face 
the same situation, the higher interest rate ends up reducing 
the amount of borrowing.

An Example of the Law of Demand in a Loan Market
This example shows why the quantity of loans demanded falls as the interest rate rises. A real estate developer is considering 
borrowing $3 million to buy land and build new homes. The process would take a year, after which she would sell the homes for 
$3.2 million. Here are her calculations under three different interest rate scenarios. As the interest rate goes up, it makes less 
sense to pursue the project.

In November 2012, the average interest rate on 30-year home mortgages dropped 
to only 3.4 percent, the lowest since the mid-1960s. Shortly thereafter, housing 
prices rose for the first time in five years.
Economic Milestone
A LOW FOR THE 
MORTGAGE RATE
2012
Households have the same response to high interest rates. 
If you are considering buying a new car, you’re much more 
likely to go through with the purchase if you can get an auto 
loan at 1 percent per year rather than 10 percent. For exam-
ple, if the car costs $30,000, a loan at 1 percent per year will 
cost roughly $300 in interest payments the first year. If the 
loan is at 10 percent, the first year’s interest payments will 
come to $3,000. That’s a big difference.
Because borrowing follows the law of demand, the demand 
curve for loans is downward-sloping, as we see in Figure 13.1 
(we first saw the downward-sloping demand curve for loans in 
Chapter 3, but it’s worth repeating). As interest rates rise, the 
quantity of loans demanded falls, all else being equal.
The Supply Curve for Loans
Why should anyone lend money? On one level, the answer is 
obvious. Lenders have more money than they can use right 
away, so they lend it to someone else who is willing to pay 
for the privilege of using it.
But step back for a moment and imagine you have some 
spare money—that is, you are a potential lender. A friend or

a relative wants to borrow the money and is even willing to 
pay interest. Why might you be reluctant to lend? 
First, if you lend someone money, there’s a risk the bor-
rower may default, or fail to pay you back on time (or at all). 
The possibility of not getting paid back on a loan is known 
as the risk of default. (See “Spotlight: What Happens after a 
Borrower Defaults?”)
Second, if you make a loan to someone, you don’t have 
use of your money for the term of the loan. For example, if 
you lend your best friend or brother-in-law $10,000 to start 
a new business, that’s $10,000 you don’t have available for 
other purposes until he pays the money back. You may 
have unexpected medical costs, or you may want to buy a 
car, or you may want to put your money in a savings 
­account where it could earn interest—but that money is not 
available to you.
The opportunity cost of not having your money available is 
known as the time value of money. Charging interest on the 
loan to your friend or brother-in-law is compensation for 
the fact that you don’t have the money available for other uses.
For you to want to make a loan, the interest rate has to be 
high enough to compensate you both for sacrificing the time 
value of money and for bearing the risk of default. As a re-
sult, you are more likely to make a loan if you can charge a 
higher interest rate, all other things being equal. If rates get 
too low, it may be more worthwhile for you to put the money 
under a mattress or even spend it on yourself.
All lenders go through the same type of calculation. The 
result is an upward-sloping market supply schedule for lend-
ing, as shown in Figure 13.1. As the interest rate rises, lenders 
are willing to supply more loans, all other things being equal. 
This is the law of supply as applied to the loan market.
Some Factors Affecting Interest Rates
As we saw in Chapter 3, the price in any competitive market 
is set at the point where quantity supplied and quantity de-
manded are equal. The market for loans is no different. The 
interest rate in the loan market can be found at the point 
where the quantity supplied of loans is equal to the quantity 
demanded of loans. We look at the downward-sloping 
­demand schedule for borrowing and the upward-sloping 
supply schedule for lending. The point where these two lines 
cross is the market equilibrium.
The equilibrium interest rate is de-
termined by a host of factors. These 
­include monetary and fiscal policy, 
which we looked at in Chapters 11 and 
12. However, here we will pick out two 
other influences on rates: the strength 
of the economy and the borrowers’ risk 
of default.
When the economy is stronger, 
businesses are more likely to invest 
because they expect they can make 
AS INTEREST RATES RISE, LENDERS ARE WILLING TO SUPPLY MORE 
LOANS, ALL OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL.
SPOTLIGHT: WHAT HAPPENS 
AFTER A BORROWER 
DEFAULTS?
When a borrower can’t repay a loan, the lender will 
want to cut its losses. If the loan is a mortgage, the 
lender will foreclose on the home, which means it will 
take the property back from the owners, who will be 
forced to leave. The lender will then sell the home to 
get back whatever cash it can. If the loan is for a car, 
the lender will repossess the car and sell it. When 
­Enron, a giant energy company, defaulted on its loans 
in 2001, its creditors sold off everything, including the 
tilted “E” logo in front of its headquarters.

FIGURE 13.2 The Impact of a Stronger Economy on the Loan Market
If businesses are see-
ing their revenues rise, 
that pushes the de-
mand curve for loans 
to the right. The equi-
librium quantity of 
loans increases from Q 
to Q′, while the equilib-
rium interest rate rises

money. They anticipate rising demand for their output, so 
they borrow to build factories, open new offices, and buy 
more airplanes and trucks.
So a growing economy—or more precisely, an economy 
that is expected to keep growing—will cause the demand 
curve for loans to shift to the right. As we see in Figure 13.2, 
the equilibrium amount of loans increases from Q to Q′, and 
the equilibrium interest rate increases from r to r′. In other 
words, interest rates are more likely to be higher in good 
times and lower in tough times, all other things being equal.
In tough times, the process operates in reverse. If busi-
nesses are having trouble selling their products or services, 
they are less likely to borrow to expand. All other things 
­being equal, the interest rate will fall.
Now let’s look at a different factor influencing rates. Not 
every loan is paid back in full: Some borrowers default, 
which means they cannot pay back the full amounts of their 
loans. Some borrowers have a higher risk of default than 
others. For example, someone who has a hard time holding a 
job is more likely to default than someone with a steady em-
ployment history. A well-established firm is less likely to 
default than one just starting up. Some industries, like res-
taurants, are notorious for their high number of failures, 
which leads to a high number of defaults on loans.
All other things equal, lenders are less willing to advance 
money to borrowers who are more likely to default. After 
all, lenders are in business to make money, not lose it when 
a borrower defaults. As a result, at the same interest rate, the 
quantity of loans made to high-risk borrowers is lower than 
the quantity of loans made to safer borrowers. This is equiv-
alent to saying that the supply curve for borrowers at a high 
risk of default is left of the supply curve for loans to low-risk 
borrowers (as we see in Figure 13.3). As a result, the market 
equilibrium for high-risk borrowers has a higher interest rate 
(see “Spotlight: Credit Scores”).
FINANCIAL  
INTERMEDIARIES  LO13-2 
In the loan example we’ve been discussing so far, we did not 
ask one key question: Where does a lender get money to 
lend out? Or to put this in more specific terms, when a bank 
makes a $10 million loan to a real estate developer to build 
some new homes, where do those funds come from? After 
all, most of us don’t have $10 million in our pockets.
FIGURE 13.3 
Why High-Risk Borrowers Pay 
a Higher Interest Rate
The supply curve for loans to high-risk borrowers lies to the 
left of the supply curve for low-risk borrowers. Thus the equi-
librium interest rate r′ charged to high-risk borrowers is higher 
than the rate r charged to low-risk borrowers.

For the most part, the funds a bank lends come from its 
depositors. Individuals put their hard-earned cash into 
­savings and checking accounts and certificates of deposit 
(certificates of deposit, also called CDs, are similar to ­savings 
accounts except that you agree to keep your money in the 
bank for a fixed time). The bank then lends those ­deposited 
funds to other consumers and to businesses. The bank pays 
interest to its depositors and receives interest 
payments from its borrowers. The loans are 
mostly mortgages, loans to established busi-
nesses, and consumer credit such as auto loans.
How do banks make profits? They generally 
charge higher interest rates on their loans than 
they pay on their deposits. For example, sup-
pose a bank pays 3 percent annual interest on a 
$1,000 deposit, or $30 for a year (3 percent of 
$1,000). It then lends out that $1,000 and 
charges the borrower 5 percent interest, receiving $50 for a 
year (5 percent of $1,000). As a result, the bank makes $20 
in profit. In addition, banks often charge sizable fees for var-
ious services; for example, if you try to write a check when 
you don’t have enough money in your checking account, 
most banks will hit you with a fee of $25 or more.
Banks as Intermediaries
A bank, therefore, is both a buyer and a seller in the market 
for money. It collects money from depositors and funnels the 
funds to the individuals and businesses that 
borrow from the bank  
(see Figure 13.4).
A bank is one example 
of what economists call a 
financial intermediary. 
A financial intermediary 
is any institution that col-
lects money from people 
or ­organizations, such as 
SPOTLIGHT: CREDIT SCORES
How do lenders determine which borrowers are at high 
risk of default? Consumers receive a credit score based 
on payment history, amounts owed on other loans and 
credit cards, length of time those accounts have been 
open, and number of new accounts. Credit scores 
range from 300 to 850, with the highest numbers being 
the best. The safest households, with no history of late 
payments and not much debt, get offered the best 
rates. But even borrowers with spotty credit histories 
can usually get loans if they are willing to pay high 
enough rates. For example, in December 2015, the 
­interest rate on a car loan could run from as low as 
3 percent to roughly 15 percent, depending on your 
credit score, as Table 13.3 shows.

pension funds, with money to invest—what we will call the 
suppliers of capital. The ­financial intermediary then di-
rects the funds to users of capital—people, ­businesses, or 
governments that are willing to pay for its use. In the case 
of the banks, the depositors are suppliers of capital and the 
businesses and individuals that borrow from the bank are 
users of capital.
In the following sections of this chapter, we will talk 
about other financial intermediaries in the economy. But 
note here that banks have a special protected status. Banks 
are tightly regulated by the federal and state governments, 
and they are required to keep a certain amount of cash 
­reserves. What’s more, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
­Corporation (FDIC), a government agency created during 
the Great Depression, insures bank deposits up to a certain 
size (currently $250,000 per depositor). 
So even if your bank closed, the FDIC 
guarantees you would get your money 
back up to the insured limit. As a result, 
savings accounts and CDs have virtu-
ally no risk for the ordinary depositor.
Another Example:  
Venture Capital
Let’s look now at a very different kind 
of financial intermediary, venture 
­capital firms. Whereas banks lend 
money to established companies, 
­venture capital firms provide funds to 
risky start-ups in their early years when 
no one else will give them money. The 
investment in these new companies is 
called, naturally, venture capital.
Well-known companies that re-
ceived venture capital in their start-up 
days ­include Intel, Apple, Google, 
Facebook, Cisco, Federal Express, 
­Yahoo!, and Amazon. More recently, Twitter, ­Snapchat, 
­Instagram, Dropbox, Uber, and Airbnb all received venture 
capital funding. Such risky start-ups are the users of 
­venture capital, and many would not exist if they had not 
received critical money at an early stage.
Venture capital firms are sometimes willing to fund 
ideas that look crazy at the time. Take Instagram, for 
­example, the photo-sharing app now owned by Facebook. 
When Instagram was started in 2010, it had no users. But 
venture capitalists were still willing to invest money be-
cause it seemed like a good idea. Two years later, Facebook 
bought Instagram for $1 billion, making the founders—and 
early investors—rich.
Where does the money for venture capital come from? 
As shown in Figure 13.5, the suppliers of capital to the 
venture capital firms are pension funds, universities with 
big endowments, and other large institutions that can af-
ford to take chances, as well as rich individual investors. 
They invest in venture capital firms such as Benchmark 
Capital, Sequoia Capital, and Kleiner Perkins. These ven-
ture capital firms are the financial intermediaries—they 
take the money from their suppliers and decide which 
start-ups to invest it in.
Like banks, venture capital firms offer a path by which 
funds can move from suppliers of capital to users of capital 
(like a pipe for money). However, the goal of venture capi-
tal firms is to find new companies that are going to be big 
winners. A rule of thumb is that only 1 out of 10 venture-
funded start-ups will be a spectacular success. Only 3 out 
of 10 will even be profitable. The rest will fail or just 
barely continue to operate. Some well-known venture-
funded failures from the past include Pets.com (which sold 
pet supplies online, and was best known for its ­slogan, 
“Because Pets Can’t Drive”), Webvan (an online grocery 
store), and Global Crossing (a telecom company). Unlike 
banks, venture ­capital firms expect quite a few of their 
­investments to fail. That’s part of the cost of doing 
business.
SUPPLIERS OF CAPITAL
The investors who 
provide the funds. In 
the banking system, 
for example, the sup-
pliers of capital are the 
depositors in the bank.
USERS OF CAPITAL
The eventual recipients, 
such as borrowers, of 
funds from a bank or 
other financial 
intermediary.

RISK AND RETURN  LO13-3 
The difference between banks and venture capital illustrates a 
key principle of financial markets: the link between risk and 
return. Risk is the possibility that something unexpected, ei-
ther good or bad, will happen to your investment. Return is 
the gain on your investment in a year, measured as a percent-
age of the original investment. And expected return is the 
average return that you can expect over the long run.
For example, a savings account is a very low-risk invest-
ment, so you can sleep well without worrying about the 
safety of your funds. The return is the annual interest rate on 
the account (perhaps a tiny 0.06 percent as of April 2016). If 
you left $1,000 in a savings account for a year, it would earn 
just 60 cents in interest (0.06 percent = 0.0006 = 
$0.60/$1,000). That’s not even enough for a cup of coffee.
By contrast, venture capital is a much riskier investment, 
but it has a much higher expected return or average return 
over the long run. In any particular year, there’s a chance that 
start-ups will fail, leading to a very low return that year. But 
the average return on venture capital from 1995 to 2015 was 
about 30 percent per year. That means an investment of 
$1,000 would return $300 per year, on average, because the 
big winners, such as Facebook, more than compensate for the 
losses.
This is a specific illustration of a much more general rule: 
the risk–return principle, which says that the only way to 
get higher expected returns over the long run is to take more 
risks. The flip side is that safe investments will 
get lower expected returns, on average.
There are several different aspects to risk. 
First, an investment can be risky if there’s a sub-
stantial possibility of big losses. For example, if 
a bank lends to businesses in a flood-prone area, 
it will not be a surprise if the businesses get 
flooded occasionally. And someone who invests 
in start-up companies shouldn’t be surprised if a 
lot of them fail.
We can also think of risk as a mea-
sure of how much the value of your in-
vestment bounces around from week to 
week or month to month. If you buy the 
stock of a big company like Microsoft, 
there’s almost no chance it will com-
pletely fail. But a month from now, the 
value of your investment could be 
10 percent higher or 10 percent lower.
Finally, here’s a third way of looking 
at risk. An investment or loan is riskier 
if it is likely to lose value at the same 
time your other investments or loans 
do. That is, a bank that makes most of 
its mortgage loans in one city is proba-
bly exposed to higher-than-usual risk if 
the real estate market in that city 
crashes because so many loans might 
default at the same time.
Risk also has different sources. 
­Default risk is the possibility that a 
borrower won’t pay back a loan on time, 
or at all. Event risk measures the odds 
that a major event, such as a terrorist at-
tack, a big earthquake, or a hurricane, 
will affect the return on an investment. 
Inflation risk is the danger that infla-
tion will suddenly accelerate, so you are 
being paid back in dollars 
that are worth less, as we 
saw in Chapter 8.
Still, no matter what 
kind of risk we are talking 
about, the basic principle is 
the same: It’s tough to 
make big gains over the 
long run without taking risks. In economics, as 
we have mentioned before, there is no such thing

as a free lunch. We’ll return to this prin-
ciple later in this chapter when we dis-
cuss the causes of the financial crisis.
The Stock Market and the 
Risk–Return Principle
To see the risk–return principle in ac-
tion, we will turn our attention to the 
stock market. First we’ll discuss the ba-
sics of the stock market, including how 
to calculate the total return on a stock. 
Then we’ll show how the stock market 
offers both higher risks and higher ex-
pected returns than putting your money 
into a savings account or another safe 
investment.
A share of stock in a company is a 
piece of ownership in that business. 
Public companies are businesses that 
have sold shares of stock (also called 
equity) to the general public. Each 
share represents a very small piece of 
the company. Facebook, for example, 
now has more than 2 billion shares.
What does an investor get from buy-
ing a share of stock? Buying one share 
of Facebook, say, makes you a part 
owner of Facebook—of a very small 
part, certainly, but still an owner. 
Shareholders elect corporate boards of 
directors and vote on major actions 
such as mergers and acquisitions. If 
enough shareholders vote together, they 
can influence what a company does. 
Recent shareholder proposals at some 
companies have included limitations on 
the pay of top executives and requests 
for environmentally sound policies.
Share ownership also entitles you to 
a dividend, which is a portion of the 
company’s profits that it pays out to 
shareholders each quarter. Some com-
panies, like Facebook, are profitable 
but don’t pay their shareholders any 
dividends. Other companies may con-
tinue paying dividends even if they report a big loss in a 
quarter or a year.
Perhaps most important, owning a share of stock gives you 
the right to sell it to someone else for a higher price than you 
paid for it—and that’s where stock markets and stockbrokers 
come in. A stock market, as the name implies, is a market 
where shares of stocks are bought and sold. The main U.S. 
stock markets are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and 
the NASDAQ, but there are stock markets in most major 
countries. (See “How It Works: Initial Public Offerings.”)
At any given moment, the market price of a stock is the 
price at which it most recently traded. If there are many 
­potential buyers of a stock, they have to be willing to pay a 
higher price to get all the shares they want, and the market 
price rises. If there are many potential sellers of a stock, they 
have to be willing to accept a lower price to get rid of their 
shares, and the market price falls.

What do companies get by selling shares of them-
selves? The short answer is that they get money for 
­expansion or new equipment, or even for planned pur-
chases of other companies. The first time a company 
sells shares to the public, it’s called an initial public 
­offering or IPO. When Google had its IPO in August 
2004, it raised $1.2 billion from the sale of its shares, 
which it partly used to finance its acquisition of YouTube.
	
Sometimes, companies have secondary public offer-
ings in which they sell additional stock to raise money. 
In 2006, Netflix, which provides movies by mail and via 
online streaming, raised $105 million by selling stock to 
the public in a secondary public offering to expand its 
DVD library. It also needed funds to buy the equipment 
to provide movies online.
	
Investors don’t typically buy their shares directly 
from the company that issued them. Instead, they go 
through financial intermediaries such as investment 
banks, the stock market, and stockbrokers, which all 
make it possible for companies to sell their shares and 
for investors to buy and sell shares easily. Investment 
banks such as Goldman Sachs handle the initial public 
offerings and secondary offerings of companies. Stock-
brokers such as Merrill Lynch (now part of Bank of 
America), T.D. Ameritrade, and Charles Schwab handle 
the buying and selling of shares between investors.

Share prices also react to changes in the future prospects 
of companies. If you think solar power is going to be the 
next big thing in the energy industry, you’ll want to invest in 
companies that make solar cells because they’ll be doing a 
lot of business in the future. If you believe oil prices will 
keep going up, you might invest in oil companies because 
they’ll continue to be profitable. Rising share prices are 
therefore a guide—though an indirect and hardly a perfect 
one—to areas of the economy that investors expect to grow.
CALCULATING THE TOTAL RETURN  It should be ob-
vious that people buy stocks hoping to get back more than they 
put in. Price appreciation is the change that occurs in the price 
of a stock. The total return on a share of stock is the change in 
the stock price, plus the dividend, divided by the original price.
Table 13.4 shows how to calculate the total return on 
stock. For example, on the last trading day of 2014, the price 
of a share of Ford stock was $15.50. On the last trading day 
of 2015, a year later, the price had fallen to $14.17 per share, 
a loss of $1.33 per share. However, over the same period 
Ford had also paid out 60 cents in dividends per share during 
the year. That means price appreciation plus dividend in 2015 
equalled $0.73 per share. As a result, the return on the stock 
in 2015 was –$0.73 divided by the share price at the begin-
ning of the period, $15.50. That gives a return of –5 percent.
Table 13.4 also shows that Home Depot stock had a total 
return of 29 percent in 2015, including price appreciation 
and dividends. That means if you had invested $1,000 in 
Home Depot stock at the end of 2014 and sold at the end of 
2015, you would have received roughly $1,290 (less stock-
broker fees), a profit of $290.  
STOCKS AND RISK  The share price of any single company 
can swing widely from day to day or month to month. This un-
predictability makes an investment in the stock market much 
riskier than, say, depositing the same money in a savings ac-
count. But common sense and economic ­research suggests that 
holding a larger number of stocks, ­especially in a wide range of 
industries, may help smooth out the swings in the value of 
your overall investment because it’s unlikely your stocks will

On any day, some stocks are up while others are down. 
That’s why we use a stock index to summarize the per-
formance of the market. The two major stock indexes 
reported by the press and followed by financial profes-
sionals are the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the 
Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index. The Dow, as it 
called, is based on the average share price of 30 stocks 
including Microsoft, McDonald’s, and Home Depot. The 
S&P 500 Index, as the name suggests, includes 500 of 
the largest and best-known U.S. companies. The sets of 
companies in the two stock indexes are regularly read-
justed to account for mergers, acquisitions, and growth 
(remember, a company has to be big to be in the S&P 
500). Facebook, for example, was added to the S&P 
500 in December 2013, replacing Teradyne, an elec-
tronics testing company.
HOW IT WORKS: TRACKING 
THE MARKET
all rise or fall at the same time. In fact, 
­diversification—splitting your money 
across different investments—is a central 
principle of financial economics. Diver-
sification can help you reduce risk with-
out reducing expected return. We might 
also call this the “don’t put all your eggs 
in one basket” rule.
Economists have spent many years 
exploring which investment mix offers 
the best trade-off between risk and 
­expected return. One approach is to 
buy a wide basket of stocks, such as the 
500 large companies which make up 
the S&P 500 Stock ­Index (see “How It 
Works: Tracking the Market.”)

238	
CH 13 
The Financial Markets
But the stock market is still risky 
even if you diversify. In good years, 
investments in the stock market can 
­return 20 percent or more, as mea-
sured by the S&P 500. But in bad 
times the stock market can plunge quickly. Between Febru-
ary 2008 and February 2009, the market dropped by 
roughly 45 percent.
This unpredictability makes an investment in the stock 
market much riskier than, say, depositing the same 
money in a savings account. But as the risk–return prin-
ciple says, along with the risk comes a higher expected 
return, based on the long-run history. For example, if you 
look at the S&P 500 Stock Index in Figure 13.6, you see 
that it zigs and zags, but the general trend over time has 
been upward. From January 1961 to May 2015, the S&P 
500 Index rose an average of 6.6 percent per year. That’s 
just price appreciation. If we include dividends, the re-
turn on S&P 500 stocks has averaged a bit below 10 per-
cent per year.
One final point: As the financial markets be-
come more thoroughly international, diversifi-
cation increasingly means putting some money 
into foreign stock markets as well. While the 
New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ 
are still the largest stock exchanges in the world, 
they now ­account for roughly one-third of the 
market value of all the world’s stocks. Other 
large stock exchanges are found in ­cities such as London, 
­Tokyo, Hong Kong, Mumbai, and Shanghai. 
THE DIVERSITY OF FINANCIAL 
INTERMEDIARIES  LO13-4 
So far we’ve talked about three very different financial inter-
mediaries: banks, venture capital firms, and the stock mar-
ket. But the full list of financial intermediaries is much 
longer. For example, the mortgage market raises money for 
home loans and then funnels it to home buyers. This is the 
market that was hurt so badly by the housing crisis because 
so many mortgages went into default. Another crucial finan-
cial intermediary is the bond market, which is the main way 
that big companies and governments raise money. We’ll dis-
cuss this market in the next section.
The fact that there are so many different ways to raise 
money is one of the strengths of the U.S. economy. It leads to 
more choice and more competition. For example, if you wanted 
to start a new business, you could charge your 
credit cards up to the limit, as some entrepreneurs 
do. Or you could borrow against your home 
through a home equity loan. Or if you were start-
ing a technology business, you might be able to 
go to a venture capital firm for funds.
Visualize a large concert hall. If only one door 
is open, it will take a long time to get everyone in.

Opening more doors speeds the process. In effect, having 
multiple ways to raise money removes bottlenecks from the 
financial system by opening up routes for individuals and 
firms to get funds.
These gains in the financial markets help other sectors of 
the economy that need to raise money—and that includes 
nearly everyone. A corporation has more options for raising 
money to erect a new factory that is expected to earn profits 
in the future, or to put up a new office building that will be 
filled with rent-paying tenants. Producers will find it easier to 
raise money from private investors to ­finance multimillion-
dollar movies they hope will be big hits. Start-up companies 
will be more likely to get the money they need to develop 
new products. Airlines will be able to borrow money to buy 
new planes they expect to fly for years to come.
The Bond Market
Let’s apply the principles of risk, return, and diversification 
to one of the main ways that corporations and government 
borrow: the bond market. It’s essential to know at least a bit 
about the bond market if you want to understand how to-
day’s economy works.
Let’s start with some terminology. A bond is a loan that 
entitles the lender—the bondholder—to get regular inter-
est payments over time, and then to get back the principal at 
the end of the loan period. (The bond can be represented by 
an electronic notation or an actual piece of paper; in either 
case, the idea is the same.) We call the borrower the seller 
of the bond; thus selling bonds is the same thing as borrow-
ing money. The bondholder, or lender, is the purchaser of 
the bond.
Figure 13.7 shows how a bond works. At the beginning 
the borrower sells the bond and receives the loan (principal). 
The lender buys the bond and pays out the principal. Then, 
over time, the borrower pays interest and eventually repays 
the principal.
Most bond sellers promise to pay a fixed amount of inter-
est per quarter or per year for the length of the loan. For that 
reason bonds are also known as fixed-income securities. 
Bond terms usually range from 1 to 30 years, though some 
companies like Walt Disney and Coca-Cola have issued 
100-year bonds. 
The suppliers of capital in the bond market are gener-
ally big institutions such as pension funds, life insurance 
companies, and mutual funds. In addition, U.S. bonds are 
often bought by foreign investors. The users of capital in 
the bond market are the borrowers, 
the bond sellers. 
All other things being equal, borrow-
ing by selling bonds is typically cheaper 
than taking a loan from a bank. One rea-
son has to do with diversification. A 
bank that gives a big loan to a company 
has to consider the possibility, however 
minuscule, of a default. In the bond 
market, however, that big loan can be 
broken down into a lot of smaller bonds 
that are sold to many different investors. 
And each of those investors can hold 
bonds from different corporations. As a 
result, they are diversified, so any single 
default has only a small impact. That 
makes investors more willing to buy 
bonds of even riskier companies, so the 
supply curve is pushed to the right—
keeping the interest rate lower than it 
would have been. Thus companies have

Government Borrowing
In Chapter 11, we talked about govern-
ment borrowing and debt without dis-
cussing the precise way in which the 
federal government borrows. In fact, the 
federal government—or more specifi-
cally the Treasury Department—issues 
many securities each year to fund the 
budget deficit. It sells Treasury bonds 
with terms of 10 years and 30 years. The 
Treasury also issues securities with 
terms as short as one month; these are 
known as ­Treasury bills. When long-
term interest rates are quoted in the 
press, they are usually the interest rates 
on 10-year Treasury bonds. The U.S. 
federal government is the biggest bor-
rower in the world. 
However, the federal government is 
also probably the safest borrower in the 
world. Its power to tax allows it to draw 
on the wealth of the entire U.S. econ-
omy to pay back any bonds it sells. As a 
result, the interest rates on Treasury 
bonds are lower than the rates corpora-
tions or individuals pay to borrow 
money for a comparable term. This is 
another application of the risk–return 
principle.
Bonds are also issued by state and local governments. 
Typically, they borrow to fund long-term projects such as 
the construction and renovation of highways, airports, park-
ing lots, sports stadiums, and schools.
In the 40 years between 1970 and 2010, 
there were relatively few instances in which 
state and local governments defaulted on bonds. 
This track record of safety enabled them to pay 
relatively low interest rates as well, though not 
as low as the federal government. However, 
since 2010, several cities and counties have de-
faulted on their debt, including Detroit and 
Stockton (CA). If investors start worrying that more finan-
cially squeezed state and local governments won’t be able to 
make all the payments on their debt, state and local govern-
ments will have to pay higher interest rates to borrow.
THE CAUSES OF THE FINANCIAL 
CRISIS  LO13-5 
Now that we have developed an understanding of how financial 
markets work, we can ask some key questions: What caused the 
financial crisis? Why did the housing market, the stock market, 
and indeed the whole economy crash so suddenly? And can 
anything be done to avoid such crises in the future? 
The first thing to realize is that financial markets are his-
torically prone to bubbles. A bubble occurs when prices in a 
financial market rise for an extended period, and investors 
convince themselves that the increases aren’t going to stop. 
At that point the bubble becomes self-feeding—believing 
that prices will go up, investors put more money into the 
market, which drives the prices well above a level that is 
sustainable over the long run.
For example, in the late 1990s, there was a bubble in tech-
nology stocks. Many investors convinced themselves that the 
Internet was an unstoppable force that was going to keep 
driving up the stock price of both existing technology firms 
and start-ups. For example, the stock price of ­Corning—one 
of the world’s biggest makers of fiber-optic cable, used for 
high-capacity data transmission—went from $16 per share at 
the beginning of 1999, up to more than $100 per share in 
2000, and then down to less than $2 a share in 2002. Fortunes 
can be made—and lost—with price movements like this. 
The financial crisis of 2007–2009 was the result, in large 
part, of a bubble as well. This time, the bubble occurred in 
the whole U.S. housing market, which represents a large part 
of the wealth of the country. From 1997 to 2006, the in-
crease in housing prices far outstripped the rate of inflation. 
That increase, in turn, led to home buyers paying ridiculous 
prices for homes because they thought they would make a 
profit when they sold, home builders constructing more and 
more expensive new homes because they thought they would 
make a profit when they sold, and banks making question-
able mortgages because even poor people could pay back 
their loans if they sold their homes in a rising market. 
Weaknesses in financial regulation also helped contribute to 
the financial crisis. Regulatory agencies such as the Federal Re-
serve did not pay close enough attention to the rapidly evolving 
markets in complicated financial instruments 
known as derivatives. Using these derivatives, 
many large financial institutions were able to 
place big bets on the housing market, which 
would pay off as long as housing prices didn’t fall. 
The financial institutions thought they had history 
on their side, because housing prices hadn’t fallen 
nationwide since the Great Depression.
In the end, of course, the housing bubble burst, home 
prices went down, and everyone was left holding the bag. 
Some financial institutions, like Lehman, went bankrupt, 
while others came close. And the U.S. government had to 
borrow trillions of dollars to stimulate demand and keep the 
economy afloat.
In response, policymakers strengthened the regulation of the 
financial system. In particular, Congress passed the Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 
2010, which President Obama signed into law. Dodd-Frank, as 
it is commonly called, was 848 pages long and touched every 
aspect of finance and insurance, including mortgages, student 
loans, and credit cards. In particular, the new law made special 
provisions for dealing with very large banks in times of crisis.

government issues

budget deficit with

On net, Dodd-Frank probably reduces the odds of an-
other financial crisis. Nevertheless, there are no guarantees. 
Financial bubbles have happened before, and they will hap-
pen again.
CONCLUSION
The financial markets are extremely important to the econ-
omy. Without them, businesses would not be able to raise 
money for future-oriented activities, such as expansion. 
Governments would not be able to borrow to fund budget 
deficits and investment in infrastructure. Individuals would 
not be able to afford to buy as many big-ticket items such as 
homes and cars.
The next chapter will cover an equally critical feature of 
today’s world: globalization. While financial markets are 
about transactions involving money, globalization is about 
movements of goods, services, and money across national 
borders. As we will see, such international trade brings up a 
whole new set of issues.

SUMMARY
	 1.	The market for loans is essential for financing house-
hold consumption and business investment. The mar-
ket for loans typically follows the laws of demand and 
supply. Higher interest rates reduce the quantity of 
borrowing, all other things being equal. Higher interest 
rates also increase the quantity of lending. (LO13-1)
	 2.	Banks are examples of financial intermediaries. That 
means they collect money from suppliers of capital 
and funnel it to users of capital. Venture capital firms 
are other examples of financial intermediaries. They 
collect money from investors and funnel it to start-up 
companies. (LO13-2)
	 3.	The risk–return principle says that in a well-functioning 
financial market the only way to get higher ­expected 
returns over the long run is to take more risks. The flip 
side is that safer investments will get lower expected 
returns, on average. For example, an investment in 
the stock market, on average, has higher risks and 
higher expected returns than putting your money into 
a savings account. Diversification, which means 
­splitting your money across different investments, can 
help you reduce risk without reducing expected 
­return. (LO13-3)
	 4.	The U.S. economy has many different kind of financial 
intermediaries. That’s an advantage because it leads 
to more choice, more competition, and a lower cost of 
funds. One important financial intermediary is the 
bond market, which lets corporations and govern-
ments raise money by issuing bonds instead of bor-
rowing from banks. (LO13-4)
	 5.	The financial crisis of 2007–2009 was the result, in 
large part, of a bubble in the housing market. In 
­addition, weaknesses in financial regulation enabled 
financial institutions to take too many risks. Since then, 
improved regulation has lessened but not eliminated 
the possibility of another financial crisis. (LO13-5)

interest rate on a typical card can go up to 25 percent or higher. True, virtually all states have usury 
(excess interest) laws that appear to limit interest rates. For example, in Michigan the usury limit is 
7 percent. However, these laws are riddled with loopholes. They do not apply to national banks, in-
cluding the ones that issue most credit cards. Nor do they apply to car financing companies or to late 
fees. In fact, the usury laws generally apply only to loans made between individuals or nonfinancial 
businesses, which of course are relatively rare. (LO13-3)

more than 5 percent on any kind of debt? Would that restriction increase or decrease the quantity 
of loans demanded? Explain.

globalization, including the nature of international 
trade, the benefits from trade, the logic behind com-
parative advantage, and the winners and losers in 
globalization. We’ll finish with a discussion of the 
trade deficit and exchange rates.
THE NATURE OF  
INTERNATIONAL TRADE  LO14-1 
The current boom in international trade may be unprece-
dented in recent history. With almost no interruptions, global 
trade has more than quadrupled since 1989, as Figure 14.1 
shows. That’s equivalent to an average annual growth rate of 
5.6 percent. By comparison, the global population only grew 
at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent over the same stretch.
Both trade in goods and trade in 
services have been soaring. Trade in 
goods happens when items are physi-
cally shipped from one country to an-
other. These include commodities such 
as oil and copper; manufactured products 
such as clothing, furniture, 
and automobiles; and high-
tech products such as com-
puters and airplanes. When 
a product crosses the bor-
der, it becomes an export of 
the originating country and 
an import of the destination 
country.
Trade in services is becoming increasingly important to 
many countries. You might be wondering how we can trade 
a service. Service trade happens when a person or a com-
pany in one country provides a service to a resident of a dif-
ferent country. Let’s start with service exports. When a 
foreign student comes to study at a college in the United 
States, the tuition payments count as payments for a U.S. 
service export (because the student, although physically in 
the United States, is still a resident of a different country). In 
other words, the United States is exporting education to the 
foreign country. Here’s another example: When a television 
network in another country broadcasts a U.S. television 
show—say, NCIS, which in 2015 was named the most popu-
lar drama in the world—it usually pays a fee to the U.S. 
owner of the show. That fee is reported as payment for ser-
vice-sector exports. The service category of exports of U.S. 
TV shows and movies was worth about $16 billion in 2014, 
compared to $3 billion in imports in the same category.
What about service imports? One example of service im-
ports is spending by U.S. residents on foreign travel: If a 
U.S. consumer travels to Shanghai, her hotel and meals there 
count as payment for a service import to the United States. 
Another example: When you call the help desk 
of a computer company and are connected to a 
customer service representative in India, that’s 
a service export for India and a service import 
for the United States.
Health care services, too, can be exported or 
imported. If someone who lives in a foreign 
country travels to a top U.S. hospital for special 
treatment, that is an export of health care services

­important, as Figure 14.2a and Figure 
14.2b show. However, in 2015, China, 
on the other side of the globe, was the 
single biggest source of imports to the 
United States.
There are several reasons distance 
has become less important. One key 
factor is that the cost and time of ship-
ping have become less onerous. The 
use of shipping containers—those  
20-foot or 40-foot metal boxes that 
dominate ports—has dramatically re-
duced the amount of labor needed for 
ocean freight transportation (not to 
mention cutting the amount and cost of 
pilferage). The containers are packed at factories, trucked to 
ports, loaded onto ships, unloaded at their destinations, and 
trucked to stores or warehouses—all without needing to be 
unpacked again. Exporters and importers are also making 
much more active use of air freight to move high-value 
items such as semiconductors and perishable items such as 
seafood.
At the same time, the Internet and better technology have 
made communication over long distances much easier. 
When a factory in China or Germany is directly linked to the 
computer system of the U.S. retailer of its products, infor-
mation about customer tastes and preferences can flow in 
real time, and coordination of production becomes almost as 
easy as if the factory were down the block.
The same ease of communication means that increasingly 
we live in a single global culture. That makes it easier to 
overcome problems with selling to customers who have a 
different language and different preferences. Following the 
lead of MTV, many television networks, such as CNN and 
BBC, now offer international or foreign language versions 
from the United States. Alternatively, health care services 
are imported when more and more patients without medical 
insurance are trying to cut costs by having expensive proce-
dures performed in other countries. A knee replacement op-
eration, for example, might cost $10,000 to $13,000 in 
Singapore or even less in India or Mexico, compared to 
roughly $50,000 in the United States. Such medical tourism 
could be the wave of the future.
Falling Natural Barriers to Trade
Why has trade risen so much in recent years? To answer, we 
first have to understand why trade between countries is dif-
ferent from trade within countries. Historically, businesses 
that wanted to sell to buyers in another country faced both 
natural barriers to trade and legal barriers to trade. The 
natural barriers include such obstacles as distance, differ-
ences in culture and values, and the difficulty of delivering 
services remotely. The legal barriers include tariffs, quotas, 
and other government actions that limit trade or make it 
more expensive.
But both natural and legal barriers to trade have become 
less important in recent years. That’s due to technological 
advances, combined with a commitment among major coun-
tries to foster freer trade. In this new situation, global trade 
is feasible among a broader range of countries, involving 
more goods and services.
Let’s start with the most important natural barrier to 
trade: distance. Distance obviously raises the cost of ship-
ping. Distance also makes communication between buyers 
and sellers much more difficult. After all, if you have a prob-
lem with your purchase, would you rather be dealing with a 
seller in your town or 10,000 miles away?
As a result, countries have tended in the past to trade most 
with their close neighbors, which for the United States 
meant Canada and Mexico. These two countries are still

Economic Milestone
HOW TV WENT 
GLOBAL
1987
The music video channel MTV was the first TV network to make the big jump across 
borders, starting with its first broadcast on a European channel in 1987. The 
company’s channels now include MTV China, MTV Sweden, and MTV Vietnam, which 
have helped create a shared global youth culture. Thus, besides being a service 
export itself, MTV also was one factor in lowering the cultural barriers to trade.
(see “Economic Milestone: How TV 
Went Global”). Large tech companies 
such as Google, Facebook, Apple, and 
Amazon have a global presence. And 
because more and more people travel 
internationally, foreign countries are no 
longer as foreign.
As a result, cultural barriers are less 
of a problem for companies that want to 
move overseas. In the past, U.S. com-
panies often didn’t understand the  
peculiarities of local cultures. For ex-
ample, the Walt Disney Company 
stumbled badly when it built a theme park in France in the 
early 1990s. It didn’t serve wine at its Paris theme park—an 
unpleasant surprise to French tourists who expected a glass 
of wine with lunch. Similarly, for years people made fun of 
the badly written instruction manuals that came with many 
imported electronics products.
The Lowering of Legal Barriers
Another important reason for the increase in trade is the 
­reduction of legal barriers. Historically, countries have put 
tariffs and quotas on imported goods to raise money and pro-
tect their own industries. Tariffs are extra charges or taxes 
levied on imports by a country, whereas quotas are numeri-
cal limits on the number of imported products ­coming into a 
country. For example, at one time, it was not unusual for 
countries to impose tariffs of 50 percent or more on imports, 
meaning that a company importing a shirt worth $100 would 
have to pay an additional $50 to the U.S. government.
Since the end of World War II, most countries—led by the 
United States—have made a concerted global effort to reduce 
tariffs, quotas, and other legal trade barriers. The first step came 
in 1947, when 23 countries signed the ­General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Successive rounds of negotiations

reduced tariffs from an average of 50 percent to less than 
5 percent among developed countries. In the following years, 
more countries joined GATT as members.
In 1995, the members of GATT converted it into the World 
Trade Organization (WTO), with 150 members and a better 
procedure for resolving disputes. China joined the WTO in 
2001—a big step. The WTO’s rules governing world trade 
include about 550 pages of agreements, plus another 30,000 
pages (!) that spell out in detail what each country has agreed 
to do to reduce tariffs and make trade cheaper and easier.
Why did the reduction of tariffs increase trade? The effect 
of a tariff is similar to the effect of a tax. The difference be-
tween what the consumer pays and what the importer re-
ceives is the tariff—so a 50 percent tariff, for example, adds 
50 percent to the price of the import, and the consumer pays 
a higher price than the importer receives.
Another version of a tariff is a fixed dollar amount for each 
item imported. For example, a country could impose a $500 
tariff on each imported car. That would add $500 to the price of 
the car, over and above the amount received by the importer.
Take a look at Figure 14.3. In the presence of such a fixed 
tariff, a consumer pays more than he or she would other-
wise, which reduces the quantity demanded (point A in the 
figure). Meanwhile, the importer receives less than it would 
have received without the tariff (point B).
When the tariff is removed, the price the consumer pays 
goes down. The revenue the importer gets to keep increases, 
and the quantity of imports supplied goes up (point C).
Trade negotiators have also worked hard to get rid of quotas, 
which are numerical limits on imports. In effect, quotas artifi-
cially restrict the quantity supplied to below the equilibrium

COMPANY CREATES 
AMERICAN JOBS
To see another aspect of globalization, go to the little 
town of Fort Madison, Iowa, next to the Mississippi 
River. At a time when manufacturing jobs are disappear-
ing all over America, Fort Madison saw the opening of a 
new factory in 2007. The surprise: The plant is owned 
and operated not by a U.S. company, but by a large 
German company—Siemens AG.
	
The Siemens operation in Fort Madison makes the 
blades for “wind turbines”—the official name for the gi-
ant windmills that are increasingly generating electricity 
all around the country. The blades are an astounding 
148 to 160 feet long, depending on the model, and 
drive wind turbines in California, Washington, Iowa, 
North Dakota, and Texas. When in place, the turbines 
themselves are higher than a 20-story building.
	
Recent activity at the factory includes building the 
blades for a wind turbine project in Oklahoma and an-
other large wind turbine project in Kansas (announced 
January 2016). Other parts of the wind turbines are as-
sembled at a Siemens facility in Hutchinson, Kansas.

International Trade
United States is negotiating two large trade treaties: one with 
Pacific Rim countries such as Japan, Vietnam, and Mexico 
and the other with the European Union. The goal of these 
treaties is to encourage global trade even more.
THE GAINS FROM TRADE  LO14-2 
Now that we have seen the growing importance of trade, the 
next question is a simple one: Why do countries trade? Why 
go to all the trouble of hauling washing machines, cars, and 
all sorts of other goods halfway around the world?
Obviously, a small country cannot produce everything it 
needs, so it must trade with others. But why did a large coun-
try like the United States—which can produce almost every-
thing it needs within its own borders—import $2.8 trillion 
worth of goods and services in 2015? And why did countries 
from Austria to Zambia import $2.3 trillion worth of goods 
and services from the United States in the same year?
The answer is that there must be big enough gains from 
trade to justify the expenses and challenges of foreign trade. 
Let’s look at what some of these gains from trade might be.
Lower Prices of Goods and Services
The main reason we buy shirts or shoes made overseas is 
that they are less expensive than comparable domestic prod-
ucts. Thus, a key gain from trade is lower prices.
For example, in 2000, the United States imported $17 bil-
lion worth of furniture and related products from countries 
such as China, Canada, and Italy. By 2015, furniture imports 
had soared to $40 billion per year, with most of this increase 
coming from China. The reason? Chinese factories could de-
liver the same piece of furniture at a lower price than a U.S. 
furniture factory. Similarly, consumer items such as toys, 
clothing, and electronics are now mainly imported because 
they can be made much more cheaply outside the United 
States.
Look at Figure 14.4. It shows the consumer price index 
for furniture, compared to the consumer price index for all 
goods and services. Until the late 1990s, the price of furni-
ture rose at roughly the same rate as all consumer prices. But 
starting around 1997, something changed: The price of 
­furniture began to fall while overall consumer prices kept 
heading up.
What changed? Imports of furniture into the 
United States started skyrocketing. In particular, 
China became a much bigger source of every-
thing from tables to bedroom sets. The imported 
furniture was considerably less expensive than 
its domestic-made counterparts—perhaps about 
­two-thirds the price, according to people in the 
industry. As a result, consumers benefited.
In addition, the competition from imports forced domestic 
manufacturers to hold down their prices. Remember from 
Chapter 5 that a company with few competitors—a monopolist 
or an oligopolist—has market power and thus can keep prices 
higher than the competitive equilibrium. When an ­industry 
SPOTLIGHT: INTERNET 
GAMBLING AND TRADE
In the 1990s, the little island nation of Antigua and  
Barbuda in the Caribbean hit on a great idea for 
­economic growth: Internet gambling. The goal was  
to create jobs in Antigua while allowing customers—
many of them from the United States—to gamble from 
the comfort of their homes. It was the ultimate service 
export.
	
Antigua’s Internet gambling businesses thrived—until 
the United States put up new legal barriers to trade. To 
be more precise, in 1999, the U.S. government started 
a much-publicized crackdown on Internet gambling 
that, among other restrictions, made it harder to use 
credit cards online to gamble. That made it more diffi-
cult for U.S. residents to log onto gambling sites in  
Antigua. Antigua complained to the World Trade 
­Organization that the U.S. ban on Internet gambling was 
an unfair legal barrier to trade because it hurt Antigua’s 
ability to export “gambling services.”
	
In 2006, the United States went further, actually ban-
ning Internet gambling (with a few exceptions) on the 
grounds that it was a danger to minors and a potential 
haven for organized crime.
	
The WTO eventually ruled in favor of Antigua and 
denied the U.S. appeal. However, as of mid-2016, the 
United States has not yet complied with the WTO ruling, 
which would have allowed U.S. citizens to gamble 
­online at Antigua sites.

Free Trade,” BusinessWeek, August 13, 2007.
level; that drives up the price. For example, in 1981, Japanese 
car makers accepted a “voluntary restraint agreement” limiting 
the number of cars they could ship to the United States. Even 
though it was “voluntary,” this agreement was the equivalent of 
a quota because Japanese car makers abided by the limits. But 
because consumers were clamoring to buy Japa-
nese-made cars, a waiting list grew for the hottest 
models. With Japanese cars in short supply in the 
United States, dealers could sell them for more—
up to $1,000 more, by one estimate.
As tariffs and quotas have been reduced or 
eliminated, trade has become much easier. 
True, countries can still 
put up plenty of legal trade barriers if 
they want (see “Spotlight: Internet 
Gambling and Trade”). But the general 
trend is toward fewer trade restrictions. 
Indeed, as of the middle of 2016, the

faces competition from imports, however, it’s harder for busi-
nesses to exert market power.
Here’s another example. At one time, all the fresh flowers 
sold by florists, supermarkets, and gardening centers were 
grown in the United States. Today, however, about two-thirds or 
more of U.S. floral needs are imported, mostly from Colombia 
and Ecuador. The climate and long days in these countries, 
both of which are on the equator, let producers grow flowers 
such as roses and carnations all year long without expensive 
hothouses. In other words, these countries have relatively 
abundant resources of the type needed to grow flowers.
The United States could replace imports with domestic 
flowers—but that would require growers to build expensive 
hothouses to yield a similar supply of blooms year-round. Do-
mestic flowers would cost more, and the large investment of 
labor and capital required to build and maintain the hothouses 
would draw resources away from the rest of the economy.
Access to Natural Resources
Another gain from trade is access to natural resources that 
either are too expensive to be produced domestically or are 
not available in sufficient quantities. An obvious example is 
crude oil, which is essential for running a modern economy. 
As we will see in Chapter 19, the United States produces far 
more oil domestically than just a few years ago. Neverthe-
less, cutting off the flow of imported oil would be enough to 
send gasoline prices sky-high. Other industrialized coun-
tries, such as Japan and Germany, have no oil resources of 
their own and, therefore, have no choice but to import oil

from other countries where petroleum is abundant, no matter 
what the price.
Meanwhile, there is a long list of important minerals that 
the United States does not produce at all. Niobium, for ex-
ample, is a metal you may never have heard of. It’s used to 
make superconductors and heat-resistant steel for items like 
jet engines and rockets. The United States has some low-
grade niobium deposits in places like New Mexico, Idaho, 
and Alaska. But the last active U.S. niobium mine closed in 
1959 because production was so expensive compared to 
other countries. So, today, the United States imports all its 
niobium, mainly from Brazil.
Access to Global Markets
Yet another gain from trade is that it gives companies access 
to global markets. Why is this important? The global market 
is bigger than any single national market, including that of 
the United States. So if you are running a company that has 
spent a lot of money developing a new product, you want to 
get the maximum benefit from your investment by selling it 
in the biggest market possible—that is, the global one.
A good example is the film industry. Big-budget movies 
with famous actors and lots of special effects are generally 
very expensive to produce. But once a film is done, the cost 
of making copies and showing the film around the world is 
quite low. That’s why movie companies try as hard as they 
can to export movies to other countries—especially action 
films, which attract a broad global audience. As a result,  
a typical successful Hollywood movie earns 
60–70 percent of its box office revenues out-
side the United States, and its earnings from 
foreign distribution count as service exports.
For instance, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, 
released in December 2015, cost about $300 
million to produce. However, it took in $2 billion 
in ticket sales around the world, with the major-
ity of that coming from outside the United 
States.
Movies are an example of a business with high fixed costs 
and low marginal costs, as defined in Chapter 4. Such busi-
nesses make more profits by selling to a bigger market, so 
they are more profitable if they can sell globally. 
Other industries also have large development costs for 
new products, making a global sales strategy essential. 
Consider the commercial airplane industry. There are only 
two major competitors right now: Boeing, a U.S.-based 
company, and Airbus, based in Europe. Developing a new 
airplane that’s both safe and economical is an incredibly 
expensive proposition—it can cost as much as $15 billion. 
It would not be possible for either Boeing or Airbus to 
develop new planes if they restricted themselves to selling 
just to their home markets. As of November 2015, Boeing 
had unfilled orders for about 5,500 commercial airplanes, 
but only about one-quarter of these came from U.S. 
companies. 
Access to New Ideas
A final gain from trade is access to new ideas from outside a 
country. Remember from Chapter 9 that knowledge is a crit-
ical factor driving growth. When countries trade, they not 
only exchange goods and services, but they also trade ideas, 
information, and new ways of doing things. That accelerates 
the development of new products.
Today, many new U.S. products are either designed in 
countries other than the United States or are the result of 
cross-country collaboration. The first iPod, for 
example, was possible because Toshiba, a Japa-
nese company, had developed a miniature hard 
drive. New pharmaceuticals are often devel-
oped and tested globally. The flat-panel LCD 
television became a commercial product be-
cause of work done in multiple countries (see 
“Spotlight: The Development of the Flat-Panel 
Television”).
Some ideas that cross national borders are 
just fun. Many of the top mobile games originated outside the 
United States. For example, Angry Birds came from a Finn-
ish game developer, Rovio. Candy Crush Saga was devel-
oped by King Digital Entertainment, a Swedish-headquartered 
company with game developers in places like Barcelona, 
Berlin, Shanghai, London, and Bucharest. Pokemon Go was 
based on characters created in Japan, even though the game 
itself was developed by an American company, Niantic. 
ABSOLUTE ADVANTAGE VERSUS 
COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE  LO14-3 
Now that we understand the gains from international trade, 
let’s examine who produces what. For example, why is so 
much furniture produced in China, while aircraft are pro-
duced in the United States?

an absolute advantage over the United States in oil produc-
tion because U.S. oil reserves require much more compli-
cated and expensive methods of extraction. Colombia has an 
absolute advantage over the United States in flower produc-
tion because of location. Colombia is on the equator, with 
more hours of intense sunlight, making it easier to raise 
flowers there.
Let’s look at another example. If one country has better 
and faster software programmers than another country does, 
the first country has an absolute advantage in software. The 
same software project will require fewer people; that is, the 
first country has higher productivity in software (remember 
that productivity was defined in Chapter 9 as output per hour 
of labor).
Sometimes absolute advantage is something that can be 
held for a long time, as in the case of Saudi oil. Sometimes 
it’s fleeting. In the software example, it’s possible for an-
other country to train good programmers. If that happens, 
the absolute advantage disappears.
The Theory of Comparative Advantage
You might think that any country will produce and export 
the products in which it has an absolute advantage. Some-
times that’s true. Saudi Arabia exports oil, for example, and 
Colombia exports flowers.
However, in general, what gets exported is determined 
by a more complicated set of factors than simply absolute 
advantage. Patterns of trade are deter-
mined by comparative advantage. 
That means a country will tend to spe-
cialize in the goods or services in 
which it has the biggest productivity 
advantage compared to other coun-
tries, or the smallest productivity 
disadvantage.
The easiest way to understand com-
parative advantage is with a simple ex-
ample from daily life. Suppose that you 
are taking a car trip with a friend. You 
are slightly better at reading maps than 
your friend, but you are a lot better 
driver. In theory, you could take on 
both tasks: drive, and then stop occa-
sionally to read the map. But you will 
probably get to your destination faster 
if you take the role where you have the 
SPOTLIGHT: THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE FLAT-
PANEL TELEVISION
Walk into an electronics store and you’ll see row after 
row of flat-panel LCD (liquid crystal display) televisions—
all of them imported. The original idea for the flat-panel 
LCD screens was developed in the mid-1960s by a 
young U.S. researcher, George Heilmeier, who worked 
for RCA, the company that developed color TV.
	
Heilmeier thought then that a flat-panel TV that could 
hang on the wall was right around the corner. But the 
­design problems were much more difficult to solve than 
he thought. It took 25 years—and concentrated research 
efforts by major companies in the United States, Europe, 
and Japan—before a flat-panel TV became a reality.
	
The process of producing a workable LCD TV would 
probably have been much slower if U.S. researchers 
had tried to do it alone. For one thing, television makers 
like RCA were reluctant to invest in LCDs, which were a 
threat to their existing business of producing glass 
­picture tubes for televisions.
	
Moreover, the different countries had different 
strengths. One historian who looked at the history of 
the LCD screen wrote the following:
America’s strength was in its speed in creating new ideas 
and then demonstrating their feasibility. Europe’s strength 
was in fundamental science and synthesizing basic materi-
als. Japan’s strength was in perfecting the implementation 
and moving it to mass production.
Today, LCD screen manufacturers—mainly Japanese, 
Taiwanese, and Korean firms—are pouring billions of 
dollars into building mammoth TV factories in China and 
elsewhere. The result is that televisions keep getting 
cheaper, larger, and thinner.

biggest advantage—driving—and let your friend take care

Now let’s look at a similar sort of trade example. Imagine 
two countries. One country, D, has good dress designers and 
workers who are fast at sewing dresses. The other country, P, 
has poor dress designers and workers who are just a bit 
slower at sewing than their counterparts in country D. From 
this description, country D has an absolute advantage in 
both dress design and sewing.
The theory of comparative advantage says that a trade 
between the two countries will make both countries better 
off. In particular, country D will probably specialize in 
dress design, where it has a big advantage. Country P will 
probably specialize in sewing the dresses, where it has 
only a small disadvantage. Country D can export dress de-
signs to country P and get back inexpensive dresses in 
return.
Here’s another way to think about comparative advan-
tage. Suppose one country has a large pool of low-skilled 
labor. Another country excels at innovation and the creation 
of cutting-edge companies. And a third country has a history 
of solid manufacturing and engineering. Comparative ad-
vantage then suggests that each country should specialize in 
what they do best, relative to the other two.
These three countries, of course, are China, the United 
States and Germany, respectively. Consider Figure 14.5, 
which shows the hourly compensation for manufacturing 
workers around the world. In 2013, the average factory 
worker in China was paid $4.12 per hour, according to The 
Conference Board. Such a low wage has helped attract man-
ufacturing orders from elsewhere (see “Spotlight: 
Offshoring”).
At the same time, Germany, with a very high compensa-
tion for factory workers, is still a manufacturing powerhouse. 
German companies such as BMW, Mercedes, and Siemens 
are the envy of the world. 
The United States, by comparison, has specialized in the 
creation and nurturing of innovative companies such as 
Google, Apple, and Facebook. As we will see in Chapter 15, 
fostering innovation and technological change requires cer-
tain expensive investments that are not easy to duplicate, 
such as R&D and venture capital. 
One final note to emphasize: A country’s comparative ad-
vantage can change over time. Consider India, which got its 
start with customer call centers because it had a relative 
abundance of English-speaking college graduates who had 
no other good opportunities in the Indian economy. There-
fore, these skilled workers were relatively inexpensive to 
hire. However, as India develops other industries that em-
ploy college graduates, such as consult-
ing and programming, it may no longer 
have a relative abundance of college 
graduates. The wages of college gradu-
ates will go up, and India may lose its 
comparative advantage in call centers.
SPOTLIGHT: OFFSHORING
Every economic era has its own new vocabulary. The 
current surge of globalization has brought us a new 
word: offshoring. Offshoring means the movement of 
manufacturing and service sector jobs to lower-wage 
countries.
	
Economists who study offshoring have difficulty 
coming up with an estimate of the number of U.S. jobs 
affected. Overall, there were 17.3 million manufactur-
ing jobs in the United States in 2000, compared to 
12.3 million in 2015. Some portion of those 5 million 
lost manufacturing jobs certainly went to other coun-
tries, but we don’t know how many.
	
At the same time, however, new jobs have been 
generated in the United States by globalization. 
­Apple, for example, received more than half of its 
­revenues from outside of the United States in 2015. 
Those overseas sales of iPhones, iPads, and the like 
helped support 76,000 Apple employees in the 
United States.
	
Moreover, figures from the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis suggest that, as of 2013, affiliates of foreign 
multinationals employed more than 6 million workers 
in the United States who work in a wide range of in-
dustries from manufacturing, to professional services, 
to finance.
	
Overall, the real impact of globalization is that it 
changes the type of work that is rewarded. It’s hard to 
economically justify keeping low-skilled factory pro-
duction work in the United States that can be done 
equally well in a low-cost country.
	
But skilled, educated workers who can function 
well in the global economy are usually in high de-
mand. In the United States, the unemployment rate for 
college-educated workers was only 2.4 percent as of 
May 2016.
Similarly, China’s comparative advantage in low-cost 
manufacturing could be challenged by countries such as 
Vietnam. Meanwhile, Germany’s comparative advantage 
in high-end manufacturing and the United States’ compara-
tive advantage in innovation could slip away as well, 
as other countries get better. As we have seen from ear-
lier  chapters, the threat of competition is an important 
motivation.
WINNERS AND LOSERS  LO14-4 
One of the most politically contentious issues in the United 
States today is the impact of trade on individuals. The theory 
of comparative advantage says that international trade will

benefit an entire economy. However, nothing says that 
particular people or companies won’t be hurt by trade.
Both theory and experience strongly suggest that trade is 
beneficial for the economy as a whole. That is, on average, 
living standards should go up in an economy that is open to 
global markets. Consumers have access to cheaper goods 
and services, and workers who once might have 
toiled in factories are now available for other 
industries.
However, there’s no rule that all individuals 
have to benefit from globalization. In fact, there 
will almost always be losers, at least in the 
short run—the people whose jobs are displaced 
and who have to move to other parts of the 
economy. This sort of displacement and move-
ment is not just a side effect of trade, how-
ever—it’s part of the key mechanism by which 
trade raises overall living standards.
 In this section, we will look at the winners and losers 
from international trade, and we will consider the problems 
with protectionism.
Winners: Consumers
As we discussed earlier, many benefits of trade show up as 
lower prices for all sorts of goods and services. So, when 
you go to the store and buy an inexpensive shirt or a cheap 
piece of electronics, you are reaping the benefits of trade. 
An iPhone, if made in the United States, would be too ex-
pensive for most people to buy.
We already mentioned that inexpensive imports help hold 
down the price of furniture to consumers. Similarly, the av-
erage price of clothing actually fell from 2000 
to 2015, as did the price of electronics, appli-
ances, toys, and sports equipment. All told, the 
consumer price index for all goods, less food 
and energy, was basically flat from 2000 to 
2015, a tribute to the power of trade.
Equally important, these gains from trade 
are broadly distributed. Anybody who goes 
into a store or who purchases online—that is, 
basically everyone—is benefiting from low-
priced imports.
Winners: Workers Who Don’t Compete 
with Imports
 Let’s think about a consumer buying a new dining room ta-
ble that was made in a Chinese factory, not one in North 
Carolina. The table costs a lot less—let’s say, $500 less—
which is good news for the consumer.

International Trade
That’s not the end of the story, though. A household that 
buys an imported dining room table now has an extra $500 
to spend. Where does it go? Recreation, perhaps. Or eating 
out, college tuition, a massage, a visit to the doctor, or any 
one of a thousand different domestic goods and services. 
In other words, the money freed up by inexpensive imports of 
goods has enabled Americans to more than double their spend-
ing since 2000 on live entertainment and sports, health care, ca-
ble and satellite television and radio services, veterinary and 
other services for pets, hotels, cellular phone services, hairdress-
ing salons and personal grooming establishments, and higher 
education. All of these are primarily supplied domestically.
More importantly, no matter what the extra money is 
spent on, it generates new jobs in the United States. For ex-
ample, veterinary and pet care services have seen a 72 per-
cent increase in employment since 2000, far outstripping the 
8 percent gain in all private employment.
Winners: Innovative Companies  
and Their Employees
Earlier in this chapter, we gave examples of how entertain-
ment companies boosted sales and profits by selling their 
highest-rated shows and movies around the world. Similarly, 
U.S. technology companies have been able to prosper by in-
vesting in new products and innovative applications and then 
expanding to other countries.
And it’s not just the companies that benefit—workers 
gain as well. As innovative U.S. companies expand to take 
advantage of global markets, they hire workers at home. As 
we saw earlier a globally successful company like Apple 
will tend to add employment in the United States as well.
The rule of thumb is simple: All other things being equal, 
globalization benefits people whose skills are relatively 
scarce in world markets. It hurts people whose skills are rel-
atively common. In general, better-educated workers should 
do better in a globalized economy because most countries 
have a smaller proportion of college graduates among their 
citizens than the United States does.
Losers: Unemployed Workers 
Now we come to one of the most distressing aspects of inter-
national trade: the transition costs. In the short run, imported 
goods and services sometimes displace domestically produced 
goods and services, resulting in lost jobs. Factories close, 
­research facilities move overseas, and home-grown fruits and 
vegetables are replaced by ones from other countries.
As we have just seen, new jobs are created as well by 
trade. But that’s slender consolation to workers who have 
lost their jobs to overseas competitors and who may not have 
the skills to switch careers.
When a factory closes, some workers retire early; the rest 
have to retrain themselves for new jobs and move to other parts 
of the country if necessary. Many displaced workers have to re-
turn to school to qualify for new jobs, which can be an expensive 
and time-consuming proposition, even if the new jobs pay more.
Moreover, certain states and regions have taken a deeper 
blow than others (see “Spotlight: States That Have Been Hit 
Hard”). With many people in the same area suffering at the 
same time, it becomes harder to find new work. In the 2016 
presidential election, many of the states hit hard by imports 
voted for Donald Trump, who spoke about the negative im-
pact of trade on American workers.
SPOTLIGHT: STATES THAT 
HAVE BEEN HIT HARD
Between 2000 and 2015, the United States lost 5 mil-
lion manufacturing jobs, with trade being at least partly 
responsible. But the damage from trade has not been 
spread evenly around the country. Some states and  
regions were much more dependent on manufactur-
ing than others. Table 14.1 lists the 10 states that had 
the highest share of manufacturing jobs as a share of 
private employment in 2000 and their total private-
sector employment growth from 2000 to 2015.
	
For the most part, these manufacturing-dependent 
states have struggled economically, though some of 
them are finally starting to recover. All of them have  
underperformed the overall United States economy, 
which showed private-sector job growth of 7.8 percent 
over this period.

The Adjustment Process
Let’s step back and look at the big picture. Figure 14.6 traces 
the bad and the good sides of trade.
From the perspective of the factory workers displaced 
from their jobs, the import boom was terribly disruptive, 
forcing them out of work and requiring them to get added 
training or education to move into a new career. But from 
the perspective of the whole economy, the surge of imports 
lowered consumer prices and freed up millions of workers 
for gainful work in other parts of the economy.
To put this a different way, if the closed factories were to 
reopen tomorrow, millions of workers would have to be 
pulled from the rest of the economy to run them. Presum-
ably, they are working at new jobs and would be missed if 
they were gone. The gain from international trade is that we 
not only get to consume the imported goods—we also get 
the benefit of all the labor freed from the manufacturing 
sector.
But there are ways of easing the pain of transition. That’s 
why the government has a role in assisting people who have 
lost their jobs retrain for new ones (see “How It Works: 
Helping the Losers”).
Arguments for Protectionism
Economists believe, and the evidence shows them to be cor-
rect, that international trade is beneficial to any economy. As 
a matter of history, countries that have been open to interna-
tional trade seem to do better, in terms of growth, than ones 
that have been more closed off. 
For example, China, India, and Germany have done well in 
recent decades—largely because they are participating actively 
in the global economy. They followed different strategies: 
China has become an important source of manufacturing 
goods, shipping all sorts of toys, machinery, clothing, and 
other manufactured goods to the United States. India has con-
centrated on exporting business services, such as computer

programming and customer service call centers. Germany 
has gone for high-end manufacturing. But the continued 
growth of each rests on trade with the rest of the world.
Yet globalization is regularly attacked by politicians who 
believe it harms too many workers. There are often demands 
for a return to protectionism—the use of tariffs, quotas, or 
other trade barriers to protect domestic 
jobs and businesses.
Are there good arguments for protec-
tionism? Some economists point out 
that trade can sometimes be disruptive, 
which means that it can impose big eco-
nomic and social adjustment costs. In 
developed countries, small towns are of-
ten organized around local factories. So 
when that factory moves to Mexico or 
China, it affects everyone in the town, 
not just the workers in the factory.
The problem of disruptive trade is 
bigger in developing countries that 
have a large agricultural subsistence 
sector composed of poor farming 
households who survive by selling 
small amounts of crops locally. The 
danger here is that foreign competition 
in agriculture could leave whole vil-
lages and regions like these without a 
livelihood. For that reason, trade trea-
ties typically allow poor countries to 
protect at least some of their agricul-
tural industries.
Another reason given for protectionism, the infant  
industry argument, is simple: An infant industry is a new or 
a small industry in a country, which is vulnerable to being 
crushed by better-funded and more mature foreign competi-
tors. Given a chance to grow while protected, however, the 
new industry could be a viable global competitor. (See 
“Spotlight: How Canadians Nurture Their Music.”)
In theory, this argument makes sense. But in practice it 
rarely seems to work because it reduces competition. In the 
1980s, Brazil wanted to develop its own computer industry. 
So the government imposed restrictions on the use of imported 
computers and software and set up regulations that forced 
domestic computer makers to use domestically made parts.
The result was to cut Brazil off from the rapid technologi-
cal progress being made in the global computer industry. As 
a result, Brazil’s computers lagged several years behind 
those in the rest of the world and were more expensive, too. 
What’s worse is that the rest of the Brazilian economy suf-
fered because of the country’s inability to use the fastest, 
cheapest computers available.
Another justification for protectionism is unfair compe-
tition. This usually refers to cases in which a foreign country 
subsidizes its exporting industries by lowering their taxes, 
The overall economy benefits from trade, but some in-
dividuals and companies are almost inevitably going to 
be hurt. As a result, there’s a logical role for some form 
of trade adjustment assistance to compensate the losers.
	
Trade adjustment assistance can include support for 
retraining; income support during a transition from one 
career to another; relocation assistance; temporary 
government payments for health insurance; and incen-
tives to businesses to help create new jobs.
	
Since at least the 1970s, the United States has tried 
various forms of trade adjustment assistance. However, 
there’s little evidence that the programs have been suc-
cessful. Depending on which economist you talk to, the 
reason is either that the programs were underfunded or 
that it’s hard for the government to intervene in labor 
markets (or both).
HOW IT WORKS: HELPING 
THE LOSERS
SPOTLIGHT: HOW 
CANADIANS NURTURE 
THEIR MUSIC
The Canadian government has mounted a determined 
effort to protect and foster Canadian culture, which it 
regards as vulnerable to being overwhelmed by its giant 
U.S. neighbor. This effort includes setting rules for the 
kind of music radio stations can play to ensure that  
Canadian musicians get enough exposure to do well.
	
The regulations require that most broadcasters  
devote at least 35 percent of their popular music  
selections to Canadian songs. And what makes a song 
Canadian? Well, it’s not enough that the performer is 
Canadian—either the music or the lyrics have to be  
written by a Canadian as well, or the song has to be  
recorded in a Canadian studio. (There are other possi-
bilities, but that’s the basic idea.)
	
The biggest winners from the Canadian content rule 
are young bands who get more airtime than they would 
otherwise. Well-known bands that benefited from this 
exposure in their earlier days include Nickelback and 
Barenaked Ladies.

offering them low-cost loans, or just giving them money. 
Armed with such a subsidy, the foreign industry can afford to 
price its products more cheaply. The result is that subsidized 
industries can get a bigger share of the global marketplace.
For example, Airbus, the European airplane manufac-
turer, has access to low-cost loans from European govern-
ments. In effect, this is a subsidy because Airbus can borrow 
money at a lower interest than it could as a “normal” com-
pany. Boeing, its U.S. competitor, has complained that these 
loans give Airbus an unfair advantage.
On the face of it, unfair competition looks a bit like cheat-
ing. However, if one country subsidizes its exports, that may 
benefit consumers in other countries. Suppose the govern-
ment of Fiji decides to subsidize its tourist industry by giv-
ing anyone who comes to the island a free room and meals. 
Obviously, this will attract travelers who might have gone 
elsewhere. For example, some tourists who 
might have spent time in Hawaii will go to Fiji 
instead, hurting the Hawaiian tourist industry.
But the tourists themselves will be better 
off: Free room and meals in Fiji—what could 
be better? In fact, the gains to consumers will 
exceed the losses to domestic industries, as in 
any other form of trade. However, losing jobs 
to unfair competition seems, well, unfair, be-
cause it comes about as the result of government decisions 
rather than pure economic competition.
Probably the most compelling reason to maintain some trade 
barriers is concern about protecting important defense-related 
industries. During peaceful times, it doesn’t matter whether 
factories are in the same country as their goods’ ultimate con-
sumers. It’s in the interest of the exporting countries to keep 
shipping their goods. After all, what else are the factories for?
But a major war changes these calculations. Once shoot-
ing starts, you don’t want to find out that all your bullets are 
made in the country you’re fighting. Or that all the special 
steel in your missiles and all the electronics in your fighter 
planes are made in a neutral country that can’t provide any 
more supplies because the shipping lanes are closed by war. 
Or even that the supply of computer and communications 
equipment, so essential for running a modern economy, 
starts drying up because so much of it is produced abroad.
National security requires balancing the economic ben-
efits of trade against the potential vulnerabilities of a 
global supply chain during war. In ordinary times, out-
sourcing cuts costs and enables the defense dollar to go 
further. But it may take too much time to rebuild factory 
capacity during war.
For that reason, it’s generally accepted that countries can 
protect some portion of defense-related production. The U.S. 
Department of Defense, for example, has to get much of its 
specialty steel in weapons systems and military aircraft from 
domestic steel mills. Critical electronics must be made domes-
tically as well. However, the United States has still not figured 
out the right balance between low cost and national security.
EXCHANGE RATES  LO14-5 
If you travel outside of the United States, one of the first 
things that you notice is that the bills and coins are different. 
Mexico uses the peso, Canada’s currency is called the Cana-
dian dollar, while Costa Rica uses the colón.
The most important currencies today are the dollar 
(United States), the euro (which is used by 26 European 
countries including France and Germany), the yen (Japan), 
the pound (Great Britain), and the yuan (China). But there 
are currencies for small countries that receive almost no at-
tention, including the Albanian lek, the Bangladesh taka, 
and the Paraguay guarani.
For two countries to trade, they need to be able to convert 
one currency to another. Suppose Honda makes a motor 
scooter in Japan and ships it for sale in Los Angeles. The 
workers in Japan are paid in yen, but the U.S. 
consumers who buy the motorcycles pay dol-
lars for them. At some point, if Honda wants to 
keep operating its factories and paying its 
workers, it has to turn those dollars into yen.
The exchange rate is the rate at which one 
currency can be converted into another. For ex-
ample, on June 10, 2016, one dollar was worth 
107 yen. That same dollar could also be turned 
into 0.89 euro or 22,300 Vietnamese Dong.
These numbers can be flipped around. For example, if 
1 dollar is worth 0.89 euro, then 1 euro is worth 1.12 dollars 
(1.12 = 1∕0.89).
In most cases exchange rates between currencies are 
floating, which means they are set in the foreign exchange 
markets. Currency traders buy and sell dollars for yen, or 
yen for euros, or euros for the Thai baht or the Indonesian 
ringit. The exchange rate is determined by the outcome of 
market transactions, and it can swing dramatically.
Some currencies do not float; instead their exchange rate is 
pegged, which means the government of the country manages 
the exchange rate to keep it fixed relative 
to another currency. For example, some 
Caribbean countries, including Aruba 
and the Bahamas, peg their currencies to 
the dollar (e.g., one Bahamian dollar 
equals one U.S. dollar). Some African 
countries, such as Chad and Senegal, 
peg their currencies to the euro.
For many years, China pegged its 
currency, the yuan, to the U.S. dollar at 
a rate of 8.3 yuan to the dollar. As of 
July 2005, the Chinese government 
began allowing the exchange rate to 
change slowly (Figure 14.7). As of June 
2016, a dollar was worth only 6.6 yuan.
When an exchange rate changes 
so that one currency can buy more of 
another, we say the first currency is

verted into another.

appreciating and the second currency is depreciating. For 
example, based on Figure 14.7, we can say that the yuan ap-
preciated against the dollar between July 2005 and June 
2016. That’s equivalent to saying that the dollar depreciated.
Effects of Appreciation and Depreciation
What happens when one currency depreciates relative to an-
other? To make this concrete, let’s suppose the dollar depre-
ciates relative to the euro: One dollar buys fewer euros, and 
one euro buys more dollars. This affects the price of imports 
and exports.
Consider what happens when a U.S. maker of construction 
equipment ships a massive construction crane to Europe that 
is priced (in dollars) at $100,000. If the exchange rate is one 
dollar for each euro, that crane sells for 100,000 euros, as line 
A in Table 14.2 shows. But if the dollar depreciates to $1.30 
for each euro, the crane sells for roughly 77,000 euros (€) to 
European buyers. The crane is the same price in dollars, but 
it becomes cheaper for European buyers, as line B shows.
Here’s another example, also from 
Table 14.2. Consider a German-made 
car priced at 40,000 euros. If it is 
shipped to the United States at a time 
when the exchange rate is one dollar for 
one euro, its price would be $40,000, as 
shown in line C. Now suppose the dol-
lar depreciates, so one euro is worth 
$1.30. That same €40,000 car would 
cost roughly $52,000 in the United 
States, as shown in line D.
The bottom line is that imports be-
come more expensive when a currency 
depreciates. Similarly, exports become cheaper when a cur-
rency depreciates. If imports become more expensive, the 
law of demand suggests that purchases of imports will fall. 
And when exports become cheaper, purchases of exports 
should rise. As a result, when a currency depreciates, its 
trade deficit should eventually shrink over time, all other 
things being equal.
The other thing that happens when a currency depreciates 
is that assets in that country—real estate, stocks, and so

forth—become cheaper for foreign investors to buy. Think 
about this. Suppose you have a U.S. home selling for 
$300,000. If the dollar–euro exchange rate is one for one, 
then a European buyer would have to pay 300,000 euros (€). 
But if the dollar depreciates to $1.30 for each euro, the price 
of that home in euros falls to only 230,000. Suddenly, U.S. 
real estate looks much cheaper to European investors, even if 
nothing has changed about their price in dollars.
THE TRADE BALANCE  LO14-6 
Let’s finish this chapter by looking at the trade balance, the dif-
ference between exports and imports of goods and services. If a 
country’s trade balance is negative—that is, if imports exceed 
exports—we say that the country is running a trade deficit. As 
we will see in this section, the amount that the United States 
borrows is closely related to the size of its trade deficit.
The U.S. trade deficit as a percentage of GDP widened 
sharply in the 1990s and the first half of the 2000s as Fig-
ure 14.8 shows. Between 2006 and 2015, the trade deficit 
narrowed as a percentage of GDP, first because 
of the recession (which reduced the amount of 
imports) and then due to declining payments 
for foreign oil.
Still, as of 2015, the United States contin-
ues to run a substantial trade deficit that 
does not appear to be disappearing. Indeed, 
the U.S. trade deficit is by far the largest in 
the world, measured in dollars.

Some Explanations for the Trade Deficit
Let’s start with “It’s our fault.” Because the big trade deficits 
started in the 1980s, some economists have put the blame 
solidly on the actions of U.S. manufacturers, consumers, and 
governments. The deficit was caused, some say, because 
U.S. manufacturers are incompetent and unable to compete 
with overseas rivals, which is why U.S. consumers have 
been buying imports. Others blame the trade deficit on over-
spending by U.S. consumers. If consumers would cut back 
on their purchases instead of borrowing heavily to buy im-
ported goods such as cars, toys, and electronics, the trade 
deficit would shrink or even vanish. Along the same line, 
many economists argue that the big trade deficit is the result 
of overspending by the federal government. In other words, 
big budget deficits cause big trade deficits.
What about “It’s their fault”? Some economists, politi-
cians, and business leaders blame the trade deficit, at least in 
part, on decisions made by foreign countries. For example, 
during the 1980s, the United States ran big trade deficits 
with Japan, which seemed to be using nontariff barriers to 
keep out U.S. exports. More recently, the Chinese govern-
ment has been accused by some of making it harder for U.S. 
companies to sell to Chinese consumers.
Finally, some economists believe the United States trade 
deficit may simply reflect the strength of the U.S. econ-
omy, rather than its weakness. People in the United States 
have high enough incomes to be able to afford high levels 
of consumption, including imports. Moreover, the United 
States, the largest and most stable economy in the world, is 
a magnet for lending from other countries. Ask yourself 
this: If you were a Chinese billionaire, would you like to 
keep all of your wealth in China, or would you prefer to 
move half of it to the comparative safety of the United 
States?
The truth is, all these explanations have an element of 
truth. The trade deficit does reflect U.S. overspending in 
part, decisions by other countries in part, and the wealth and 
health of the U.S. economy in part.
Paying for Trade
But no matter what explanation for the trade deficit you ac-
cept, this is true: If you buy an imported toy, bottle of wine, 
or car, you have to pay for it, one way or another. As econo-
mists say, there is no such thing as a free lunch. A country 
must pay for its imports somehow. There are four ways to do 
this (see Table 14.4).
One way to pay for our imports is to send back exports of 
our own goods and services. The United Arab Emirates 
sends us oil, and we send commercial aircraft, military 
­aircraft, and drilling equipment. Australia sends us wine, 
uranium, and beef, and we send excavating machinery, agri-
cultural machinery, drugs, and medical equipment.
But what if we are running a trade deficit with a country? 
When China ships us a container ship full of toys, what do 
we send China in return? One possibility is that China and 
other countries can give us the goods and services on credit, 
like a bar that lets its patrons run tabs. As of the end of 2015, 
the United States owed more than $10 trillion to the rest of 
the world. The biggest chunk of that was roughly $6 trillion 
in borrowing by the federal government.
From one perspective, $10 trillion seems like a lot of 
money because it comes to roughly $31,000 per American. 
Paying back that much debt may decrease the amount of 
money available for our future consumption. 
On the other hand, if our economy is growing fast enough, 
even a high level of obligations may not be a problem. A fast-
growing country will likely have enough future income to 
pay back accumulated debt—much as a family with a rising 
income can pay back the mortgage it used to buy a house.
Alternatively, we can pay for imports by selling other coun-
tries valuable U.S. assets. These can be stock shares in U.S. 
companies, for example; as of the end of 2015, foreigners 
owned almost $6 trillion in U.S. stocks. Or we can sell some of 
our real estate to foreigners to help pay for our imports. In the 
late 1980s, for example, when the United States was running a 
large trade deficit with Japan, Japanese companies bought a 
chunk of Rockefeller Center in New York City and Pebble 
Beach Golf Club in California, among other purchases.
A fourth way of paying for imports is to encourage for-
eign companies to invest directly in the United States by 
building factories and office buildings here. Such foreign

THE LAST TRADE 
SURPLUS
1975
In 1975, the United States ran a small excess of exports of goods and services over 
imports, as a weak economy cut consumer demand. That was the last U.S. trade 
surplus. Since then, the United States has registered 40 straight years of trade 
deficits, with no end in sight.

CONCLUSION
In the past, you might not have given a moment’s thought to 
China, India, or any other faraway country. Today, however, 
globalization is one of the key driving forces of the econ-
omy, and there’s no way to understand your future without 
some knowledge of international trade.
Still, globalization would not be possible without break-
throughs in communication and transportation. That’s what 
has enabled national economies to be tied closer together. 
It’s these sorts of technological improvements that we will 
discuss in the next chapter.

SUMMARY
	 1.	The current boom in international trade may be unprec-
edented in recent history. Both trade in goods and trade 
in services have expanded. The increases are due to 
falling natural barriers to trade, such as distance, and 
falling legal barriers to trade, such as tariffs. (LO14-1)
	 2.	The gains of trade include lower prices of goods and 
services, access to natural resources, access to global 
markets, and access to new ideas. For example, inter-
national trade allows consumers and businesses to 
buy lower-priced imports. (LO14-2)
	 3.	If it takes fewer resources to produce the same good 
in one country than in another, the first country has an 
absolute advantage in that good. However, patterns 
of trade are determined by comparative advantage 
rather than absolute advantage. Comparative advan-
tage means that countries specialize in the products 
or services for which they have the biggest productiv-
ity advantage—or the smallest productivity disadvan-
tage. (LO14-3)
	 4.	The theory of comparative advantage says that there 
always is a trade between two countries that makes 
both better off. You cannot identify a country’s com-
parative advantage by just looking at its own economy. 
You also have to know how it compares to its trading 
partners. (LO14-3)
	 5.	Economists believe that the gains from trade are 
broadly distributed. However, particular people and 
companies may be hurt by trade. In the short run, the 
transition costs of adjusting to trade can be large. Ar-
guments for protectionism include the disruptive ef-
fects of trade, the desire to protect infant industries, 
concerns about unfair competition, and the need 
to  protect important defense-related industries. 
(LO14-4)
	 6.	The exchange rate is the rate at which one currency 
can be converted into another. If the exchange rate 
changes so that one currency can buy more of an-
other, we say that the first currency is appreciating and 
the second is depreciating. A depreciating currency 
makes imports more expensive to domestic buyers 
and exports cheaper to foreign buyers. (LO14-5)
	 7.	There are several explanations for why the United 
States has been running big trade deficits. These in-
clude overconsumption by the United States, policies 
by foreign countries that keep out U.S. exports, and 
the strength of the U.S. economy. (LO14-6)

to create and commercialize new technol-
ogy, and then technological change and 
innovation drive economic growth. In fact, 
one of the greatest advantages of the U.S. 
economy, compared to its rivals in Europe 
and Japan, has been its ability to take new 
ideas and commercialize them quickly.
	
In this chapter, we will use our tools of 
supply and demand to understand the 
economics of technological change.
	
We’ll describe the different kinds of in-
novation and look at the factors affecting 
the supply of and demand for innovation.

n August 2016, the government issued 
its first safety rules for the commercial 
use of “drones”—small unmanned aircraft. 
In the years ahead, we could see drones 
delivering packages, reporting on traffic 
jams, and watching for flash floods. 
	
Drones are just one new technology af-
fecting the economy and the way we live 
our lives. Indeed, the growth of the mod-
ern market economy is, in many ways, the 
story of technological change. Science—
the urge to understand nature—has been 
harnessed to the profit motive, and 
the combination has been exceptionally 
potent.
	
Finding the next big innovation is a 
good way to make money. James Watt in-
vented the steam engine in the 1700s to 
pump water out of mines and became 
rich in the process. Henry Ford invented 
the assembly line and the Model T auto-
mobile and created one of the greatest 
fortunes in U.S. history. Larry Page and 
Sergey Brin invented a better search en-
gine, and the result—Google—made them 
both billionaires.
	
It’s a virtuous circle. Economic incen-
tives encourage people and businesses

Technological Change
THE NATURE OF 
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE  LO15-1 
As we saw in Chapter 1, technological change is an im-
provement in knowledge that increases the range of goods 
and services that the economy can deliver. By definition, 
technological change expands the limits of what we can pro-
duce, given today’s natural resources and workforce. Tech-
nological change leads to innovations, which are new 
products and processes.
Without technological change, it’s impossi-
ble to get sustained increases in living stan-
dards. Imagine, if you would, today’s world 
with the technology from a century ago. No 
antibiotics or television—they didn’t exist in 
1915. No commercial air travel, although by 
1915 airplanes were playing a role in World 
War I, including the invention of the first 
fighter plane. The first transcontinental phone 
call came in 1915, but there was no Internet. 
Your life expectancy was only 53 years for men and 57 years 
for women, and air conditioning had not been invented.
Since those days, a century ago, technological progress 
has proceeded in waves. One wave came in the first half of 
the 20th century, with amazing breakthroughs like antibiot-
ics, radio, air travel, television, widespread use of electricity, 
cars, plastics, and other new materials that had never existed 
before. For example, nylon, the first synthetic fiber, was in-
vented in 1935.
The next stretch—from roughly 1950 to 1975—had fewer 
big breakthroughs. Instead, it was a productive period of 
building on earlier innovations. Companies refined and im-
proved their new products, in some cases in major ways. For 
example, the shift from black-and-white to color television 
happened in the 1960s and 1970s (in 1966, NBC became the 
first network to broadcast its shows in color). Airlines intro-
duced widespread use of jets, which 
replaced propeller-driven planes and 
improved speed and passenger comfort.
However, in the 1970s, it became 
clear that two highly touted break-
through technologies were failing to de-
liver much in the way of economic 
benefits. The first was space travel. Put-
ting a person on the moon in 1969 and 
making five additional landings over the 
next three years was a great public rela-
tions achievement. But ­despite all the 
hoopla, the manned space program, including today’s space 
shuttle launches, has generated relatively few economic re-
turns so far. Our major economic uses of space today, includ-
ing the launching of weather and communications satellites, 
mainly predate the beginning of the manned space program.
The second big failure from an economic perspective was 
nuclear energy, which was supposed to be a limitless source 
of cheap power. When the first nuclear power plants were 
built after World War II, utility companies expected the cost 
would fall, just as other new technologies had become 
cheaper over time. Instead, nuclear power plants 
became more expensive to operate and build, 
and safety considerations loomed larger—espe-
cially after the 1979 accident at Three Mile Is-
land in Pennsylvania and the 1986 Chernobyl 
disaster in Russia. U.S. utility companies, which 
stopped ordering nuclear power plants after 
Three Mile Island, have been planning to build 
more, but that will be slowed down by the 2011 
Fukushima incident in Japan.
The Information Revolution
While space travel and nuclear power have fallen short of 
expectations, there has been one source of innovation that 
has transformed our world: information technology. In 1971, 
Intel created the first microprocessor—a computer on a 
chip—for use in a Japanese calculator. Apple, led by Steve 
Jobs and Steve Wozniak, introduced the Apple II in 1977, 
the first real mass-market personal computer. IBM produced

the IBM PC in 1981, using an operating system from 
­Microsoft, then a small, unknown company.
These events created enormous excitement and press at-
tention at the time. The new companies and their inventions 
also produced a generation of billionaires and multibillion-
aires, led by Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft. Yet econ-
omists were justifiably skeptical about the impact of personal 
computers on the economy. At the time, there was no sign 
they were really changing how business was done or helping 
the United States compete better in global markets. They 
seemed more like toys.
But electronic devices grew smaller, faster, cheaper, and 
more powerful each year, following Moore’s law. Named

One of the most important uses of the Internet is for e-
commerce: buying and selling over the Web. More and 
more retail sales are conducted via the Internet, and vir-
tually every business of any size has a website. Even 
when actual sales are made in person, shoppers use 
the Internet to collect information beforehand.
	
Still, e-commerce is relatively small. According to the 
Census Bureau, e-commerce sales in the first quarter of 
2016 came to only 7.8 percent of total retail sales. That 
makes sense: There are so many things, such as gaso-
line, that simply can’t be bought online. Moreover, peo-
ple like to touch and see what they are buying.
	
But as e-commerce companies such as Amazon of-
fer a wider variety of goods, the role of e-commerce in 
the economy continues to grow.
HOW IT WORKS: 
E-COMMERCE
for Geoffrey Moore, one of the founders of Intel, Moore’s 
law says that microprocessors double their performance 
every 18–24 months. That is, with the same resources, over 
time, we can do a lot more computing. In rough terms, as 
Figure 15.1 shows, the personal computers of the 2000s 
were 10,000 times more powerful than the ones available in 
1980. Of course, smartphones are powerful computers in 
their own right.
Sometime in the early 1990s, computers became power-
ful enough to make a real difference in the economy. This 
advance ignited the information revolution, which means 
the application of the additional processing capacity of the 
new generation of computers to a wide variety of new uses. 
These included sophisticated financial models for banks and 
Wall Street firms, corporate databases for retailers and man-
ufacturers, and computer games of all sorts.
Perhaps most important, as computers became faster, they 
revolutionized communications. The Internet is based on the 
idea that information of any sort—a web page, an e-mail 
message, a picture—can be broken into 
little packets of information and routed 
to the right destination. This sort of net-
working would not be possible without 
very fast computers.
Similarly, fast and cheap computing 
was the essential factor behind the de-
velopment of the iPhone, which would 
not have been possible in 1985 or even 
1995. Nor would YouTube, which de-
pends on fast communications to let us-
ers upload and view online videos. And 
most important, globalization could not 
have come about without the fast, cheap 
communications that let customer ser-
vice representatives in India answer 
calls from customers in Idaho.

Technological Change
THREE TYPES OF  
INNOVATION  LO15-2 
Our society and our economy have been shaped 
by technological change and innovation. Yet 
not all innovations have the same degree of im-
pact. In fact, we can identify three different 
channels by which technological change and innovations can 
affect businesses and consumers—and thus the economy.
Productivity Enhancements
Suppose Toyota figures out how to produce cars with fewer 
parts or with fewer steps on the assembly line. Then it can pro-
duce and sell the same number of cars as before at a lower cost. 
This is an example of a productivity-enhancing innovation.
In general, a productivity-enhancing innovation in an in-
dustry gives you more of the same product, holding fixed the 
resources used. That has the effect of shifting the supply 
curve to the right. The reason is that businesses can afford to 
produce more output for the same cost, typically reducing the 
market price and increasing the quantity sold in the market.
Productivity-enhancing innovations can be small and 
gradual—or large and disruptive. The 
small ones are common because com-
panies are forever tinkering with their 
operations to cut costs or boost output. 
Such small innovations don’t change 
the nature of the final product or ser-
vice, though sometimes they reduce its 
cost a bit. The refrigerator that you buy 
today still performs basically the same 
functions  as the one your parents 
bought 30 years ago.
However, 
some 
productivity-­
enhancing innovations can have a major 
impact across the entire economy. Com-
puters and electricity are general-purpose 
technologies that we can apply in almost 
every industry to boost output and lower 
costs. Electricity enables energy to be 
generated in one place and distributed, 
quietly and safely, to light homes and of-
fices, to run labor-saving motors and ma-
chinery, and to power refrigerators. 
Computers and the miniaturization of 
data storage devices have changed almost every 
aspect of our public and private lives, from com-
munication to banking to entertainment.
New Goods and Services
A second kind of technological change yields 
the creation of new goods and services, en-
abling people to do things that weren’t possible before. 
These are not mere improvements but spectacular jumps for-
ward that change daily life. Television, for example—the 
beaming of live pictures into the home—had no analogue in 
the past. Now it eats up an average of more than two hours 
per day for adults (three hours per day on weekends!).
Or consider the cell phone. On one level, it’s just another 
way to make a phone call, something that has been possible 
since 1876. But on another level, the portability of the cell 
phone lets us be permanently connected to the communica-
tions grid no matter where we are. That’s a major change in 
how we live our lives, as evidenced by the number of people 
who walk through the streets with their phones pressed to 
their ears or eyes glued to their screens. Additionally, smart-
phones, such as the iPhone, are powerful enough to substi-
tute for computers in many applications.
And what about the combination of the Internet and a pow-
erful search engine such as Google? Together, the two enable 
you to do incredibly fast searches, at no cost, across an enor-
mous set of information. In theory, if you had enough money 
or time, you could have done something similar in the past by 
poring through library stacks and reading endless rolls of mi-
crofilm. But the truth is that the Google–Internet combination 
is a truly new service that was not available before.
Some innovations fit more than one category: They both 
enhance productivity and provide new goods and services. 
In the early part of the 20th century, as electricity became 
more common, it replaced other forms of power in factories. 
This was productivity-enhancing because electricity cut 
costs without changing what the factories produced. But 
electricity also created the opportunity for firms to produce 
new goods and services, such as elevators and escalators, 
that did not exist before.
Quality of Life
A qualify-of-life innovation does exactly what it says: en-
hance the quality of life for you and those around you. The

FIRST SYNTHETIC 
FIBER
1935
Chemists at DuPont learned how to turn coal into a silk-like fiber they called nylon. 
Within a few years, nylon and other synthetic fibers were being used in parachutes 
and women’s stockings. In toothbrushes, they replaced boar’s hair bristles. Soon, 
the production and use of synthetic fibers had become a multibillion-dollar industry.

SPOTLIGHT: THE BIOTECH REVOLUTION
The next big wave of innovation may come from  
biotechnology, which is the use of new techniques to 
modify living cells and biological molecules. Scientists 
have labored hard in recent years, and there have have 
been enormous advances in this area. These include the 
decoding of the human genome, a much deeper under-
standing of how the human body works, and the ability  
to manipulate the internal workings of cells. Stem cell  
research (an intensely controversial topic) is generally  
considered part of biotechnology as well.
	
Biotech has the potential to allow enormous break-
throughs in medical care, agriculture, and even energy.  
In theory, once we know the underlying workings of the 
human body, it should be possible for us to create drugs 
or treatments targeted directly at any medical  
or genetic problems. We could even create new plants 
that are more efficient at turning sunlight into usable fuel, 
or converting garbage into power.
	
However, so far biotech has promised a lot more than it 
has delivered. The first biotech drug arrived on the market 
in 1982, and since then, there have been a fair number of 
success stories but it has not yet transformed health care. 
There has been no biotech equivalent of Google.
	
Should we be pessimistic about this progress? Not nec-
essarily. Remember that the microprocessor was invented 
in 1971, and, for the next 20 years, economists regularly 
complained that it wasn’t having much of an impact on the 
economy. Indeed, Nobel Prize–winning economist Robert 
Solow wrote in 1987, “You can see the computer age  
everywhere but in the productivity statistics.”
	
It wasn’t until the mid-1990s—25 years after the first  
microprocessor was made—that the information revolution 
took off. The lesson is that new technologies mature slowly. 
Biotech, despite all its grandiose promises and failures, 
may only now be getting to the point where it will make a 
big difference.
Chapter 6, a quality-of-life innovation 
generates positive externalities or re-
duces negative externalities. Diminish-
ing pollution affects many people 
simultaneously. Similarly, an improve-
ment in the health of a parent will im-
prove our quality of life as well.
INNOVATIVE  
ACTIVITIES  LO15-3 
Where do innovations come from? They don’t simply fall out 
of the sky. Instead, innovation and technological change are 
the direct result of innovative activities. Those 
are any economic activities directed primarily at 
creating and developing new products, pro-
cesses, ideas, knowledge, and technology. One 
example of an innovative activity would be a 
scientist studying the biochemistry underlying 
cancer. Another example would be an automo-
bile company devoting resources to developing 
that lets you or your loved ones live longer or better. For 
­example, Alzheimer’s disease—a debilitating form of 
­dementia involving loss of memory and alterations to 
­thinking—­currently afflicts 4 million U.S. adults, mostly the 
elderly, and that number is likely to rise quickly as the popu-
lation ages. Right now, there is no cure. But if medical sci-
ence could produce a way of even reducing the severity of 
Alzheimer’s, that would be a tremendous quality-of-life in-
novation (for a source of possible innovations in health care, 
see “Spotlight: The Biotech Revolution”).
Technological advances that reduce pollution also fall into 
the category of quality-of-life innovations. Less pollution 
does not necessarily show up in any of the usual measures of 
economic output (as we will see in Chapter 19). Nevertheless, 
most people prefer a cleaner environment for its 
health benefits, for the beauty of nature and the 
safety of wildlife it enhances, and for its benefi-
cial impact on our planet’s ecology.
What’s the difference between a quality-­
of-life innovation you enjoy and an ordinary 
innovation that gives you pleasure—say a 
new generation of iPads? In the language of

The Bulova Watch Company ran a short ad before the television broadcast of a 
Brooklyn Dodgers–Philadelphia Phillies baseball game in 1941. Bulova paid less than 
$10 for the 20-second spot, which was the first TV commercial. By providing television 
stations with a source of revenue, commercials turned the innovation of television into 
a rapidly expanding business.

a fully electric car. Still another exam-
ple would be an entrepreneur starting a 
new company to develop a new type of 
microprocessor or a company employ-
ing programmers and artists to create a 
new video game.
The amount of money available for 
research and development (R&D) is 
the most important measure of the 
amount of innovative activities going 
on in an economy. R&D represents 
money and resources—particularly 
­human resources—that economies or 
businesses devote to science and tech-
nology. It can be undertaken by corpo-
rations, by the government, or by 
scholars in academic settings. Corpo-
rate funding for the development of a 
new drug, for example, comes under the 
heading of R&D. So does a government 
research grant to a physics professor for 
the study of superconductors. In sum, 
R&D is anything that moves the frontier 
of science and technology forward.
Figure 15.2 shows that in 2014, the 
U.S. public and private sectors spent al-
most $500 billion on R&D. The next largest is China, fol-
lowed by Japan and Germany, though there is debate about 
whether such Chinese spending is being correctly measured. 
Most countries spend little on R&D.
One category of R&D is basic research, which is de-
voted to scientific investigations that have no immediately 
obvious commercial applications. In the past, big companies 
like AT&T and IBM did basic research in their labs. For 
­example, two researchers at AT&T’s Bell Labs—Arno A. 
Penzias and Robert W. Wilson—won the 1978 Nobel Prize 
in physics for their discovery of faint background radiation 
remaining from the “big bang” explosion that is believed to 
have given birth to the universe.
Today, however, basic research is performed mostly in uni-
versities and nonprofit institutions and is funded primarily by 
the federal government. Corporations, under much more in-
tense competitive pressure, have focused their attention on ap-
plied research and development. Applied research is scientific 
research focused on solving real-world problems, while devel-
opment is aimed at creating commercial products. For exam-
ple, if a pharmaceutical company spends heavily to test 
different approaches for fighting cancer, that is applied re-
search. But testing a particular drug counts as development.
The Market for Innovative Activities
Traditionally, economists have treated technological change 
as a kind of black box, driven by nonmarket factors such as 
government funding for R&D. To some extent, that’s still 
true. In particular, spending on basic R&D, which has no 
immediate economic payoff, is money that must come 
mainly from the government or from universities.
But, in many other cases, we can think about innovative 
activity as a service that can be bought and sold in a market, 
just like any other service (Figure 15.3). First, innovative 
activities have a price. The price of research, for example, 
might be the salary for a scientist for the year and the price 
of renting or buying the equipment. Or imagine that rather 
than trying to create new products by itself, a frozen-food

business pays a scientific research laboratory to do its de-
velopment (such firms exist—e.g., SRI International, with 
more than $500 million in revenues per year). In that case, 
the price of innovative activities is the amount the frozen-
food company pays per month to the scientific research 
firm.
The supply curve for innovative activities tells us the 
quantity of innovative activities that are supplied, given 
their price. For example, given the wages paid to scientists, 
the supply curve tells us how many people will be available 
for science and engineering jobs, as opposed to law or other 
occupations.
Similarly, the demand curve for innovative activities 
tells us the quantity of innovative activities businesses will 
want to fund, given the price. For example, given the wages 
paid to engineers and scientists, the demand curve tells us 
how many resources a business is willing to devote to creat-
ing a new product. The willingness to spend on knowledge 
creation, of course, depends on how much profit the busi-
ness can expect to make from the new product and whether 
it’s easy for competitors to copy.
Consider, for example, the market for research into 
­cancer-fighting drugs. The price of research is the amount of 
money a business pays for, say, one year’s worth of research 
by a scientist. The greater the price, the more scientists will 
move into anticancer research, so the supply curve slopes 
up. Meanwhile, the higher the price of such research, the 
less of it drug companies will want to buy. Hence, the de-
mand curve for innovative activities slopes down. For an-
other example of the market for innovative activities, see 
“Spotlight: Private Space Tourism.”
How does this market-based view of innovation help us? It 
tells us that if we want more innovation, we should look at 
factors that shift the supply and demand 
curves. That’s what we will look at in 
the next two sections.

SPOTLIGHT: PRIVATE  
SPACE TOURISM
For an example of the market for innovative activities  
in action, consider private space travel. Since the first 
manned space flights in 1961, space travel had been 
solely the responsibility of government agencies, 
mainly in the United States and Russia. These agencies 
did not operate by markets. Instead, they were willing 
to spend tens of billions of dollars to put people into 
space for both prestige and research.
	
Private businesses could not afford that kind of 
money. For private space travel to become a reality, it 
had to become a lot cheaper than government-funded 
space travel—and just as safe. For years, that didn’t 
seem possible.
	
But recently, two sets of market forces converged to 
make private space travel possible. First, there is sud-
denly greater demand for private space travel by a long 
line of rich individuals willing to pay big bucks to go into 
space. That made it more attractive to research rela-
tively inexpensive space travel. Second, new materials 
made it possible to build a safe spacecraft more cheaply.
	
In other words, both the demand and supply curves 
for the development of relatively inexpensive space 
travel shifted to the right. The result was far more re-
search into private space travel. In 2004, a spacecraft 
called SpaceShipOne became the first privately funded, 
manned spacecraft to arrive in space at an altitude of 
more than 70 miles. (In the process, it won a $10 million 
prize.)
	
This showed that private space travel was possible. 
Now Virgin Galactic—a company started by Virgin  
Atlantic owner Richard Branson—has a waiting list of 
people willing to pay $250,000 for a short trip into 
space. Test flights have started, and a “spaceport” is 
being built in New Mexico.

venture capital, and location in an innovation 
cluster. In the next section, we’ll also examine 
the factors that can cause the demand curve for 
innovative activities to shift.
Availability of Scientists and 
Engineers
A key factor affecting the supply curve for in-
novative activities is the availability of scientists 
and engineers—the people who perform actual 
research and development. That’s consistently a problem in 
the United States because the number of people getting PhDs 
in science and engineering has not kept up with demand.
Part of the problem is simply that wages for scientists 
and engineers have not risen as fast as the wages for other oc-
cupations a highly educated person can enter. According to the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median salary of a biochemist 
or biophysicist was $82,000 in 2015, while the median salary 
for a chemist was $71,000. That’s quite low considering that 
these jobs usually required some sort of advanced degree. By 
contrast, the median salary of a lawyer was $116,000, while 
the median salary of a financial analyst was $80,000.
As a result, many members of the scientific and 
engineering workforce in the United States are 
originally from other countries. Some enter the 
United States as graduate students and remain here 
to work; others come because they are offered jobs.
There’s a heated debate about whether the 
immigration of skilled scientists and engineers is 
a good thing for the United States. On the one 
hand, it pushes the supply schedule of the market 
for scientists and engineers to the right, lowering 
the pay of U.S. scientists and engineers, as shown in Fig-
ure 15.4. On the other hand, it raises the number of engineers 
and scientists, which pushes the supply schedule for innova-
tion to the right and increases the amount of innovation, as 
shown in Figure 15.5. The net result, as is true for most types 
of foreign trade, is that the influx of foreign-born scientists 
and engineers is probably a good thing for the country as a 
whole but is problematic for a subgroup of the population.
Availability of Venture Capital
It doesn’t do any good to have a bright idea if you can’t sup-
port yourself and a small staff to develop it. And banks typi-
cally won’t lend money to brand new businesses without a 
track record of profits.
One solution to this problem is venture capital, which we 
discussed in Chapter 13. Venture capital funds collect money 
from insurance companies, pension funds, college endow-
ments, and wealthy individuals, and they invest those funds 
in high-risk technology start-up companies. Venture capital-
ists closely monitor the start-up companies they invest in, 
help them with key strategic decisions, and even replace the 
company founders if it looks like they are not up to the task.

Venture capitalists expect that most of their investments 
will not create successful companies. In fact, they accept a 
failure rate that would make a banker’s hair turn gray. Most 
companies funded by venture capitalists never become prof-
itable and eventually close.
However, the big successes—starting with Intel and run-
ning through Facebook and Google—are truly impressive 
and make up for many failures. Venture capitalists who in-
vested in Google, for example, made quite a bit of money. 
As noted in Chapter 13, the average return on venture capital 
from 1995 to 2015 was about 30 percent per year. But any 
particular deal is extremely risky. 
The availability of venture capital has the effect of shift-
ing the supply schedule for innovation to the right. What’s 
interesting is that venture capital itself is actually a relative 
innovation in the financial markets. The first modern ven-
ture capital fund was started in 1946. Other countries have 
some venture capital, but far less than in the United States.
Location in an Innovation Cluster
If you list some of the great tech companies of the world, a 
healthy share of them started in the area south of San Fran-
cisco now known as Silicon Valley. Two engineers named 
Gordon Moore and Bob Noyce founded Intel in 1968 in Santa 
Clara, California, then a sleepy little town about 20 minutes 
south of Stanford University. Google has its headquarters in 
Mountain View, the next town north of Santa Clara, and Face-
book is based in Palo Alto, just a bit closer to San Francisco.
It’s not simply coincidence. The chances of innovations 
occurring seem to improve when innovative companies are 
clustered together because they can share ideas and workers. 
A pool of skilled and experienced labor moves from com-
pany to company. There are good resources, like lawyers who 
understand technology and start-ups. 
And there are sources of financial sup-
port, like nearby venture capital firms.
In addition, innovation is easier 
when there is a major university nearby. 
Google and Yahoo! were both started 
by Stanford students. Other technology 
hot spots include Cambridge, Massa-
chusetts, which has become the world 
center for biotech, and Bangalore, which has become the 
center for software in India. New innovation clusters include 
New York City, London, and Berlin. 
In other words, an innovation cluster is a region where 
the resources for innovation are plentiful so that the supply 
curve for innovative activities is shifted to the right. As a 
result, innovation is easier for a business located in an inno-
vation cluster like Silicon Valley.
Once innovation clusters get started, they tend to persist. 
Silicon Valley, for example, has retained its magic. Some of 
the hottest new companies, like YouTube, have started there 
in recent years (see Table 15.1). The power of clustering 
continues.
How Immigration Affects 
Innovation
Immigration increases the supply of engineers and scientists, 
which pushes the supply curve for innovative activities to the 
right. The result is more and cheaper innovation.

INNOVATION: THE DEMAND  
SIDE  LO15-5 
The demand for innovative activities is a tricky thing to 
measure. Everybody likes the newest or best technology—
unless your job is being eliminated by automation, or your 
home is threatened by pollution from a new factory down the 
street, or your scenic view is blocked by energy-generating 
windmills. The truth is that it’s not unusual for new tech-
nologies to face opposition—from existing companies, from 
workers who feel their jobs are threatened, or simply from 
ordinary people who don’t like change.
That’s why technological change needs to be propelled by 
a strong force—which usually is the profit motive. What 
sustains innovation is the fact that businesses can make 
money from it. Although, in theory, the government can 
fund and encourage innovative activities, in practice no soci-
ety has been able to sustain a commitment to innovation 
over a long period without the profit motive.
So let’s look at the factors that can determine 
the demand curve for innovative activities.
Return and Risk from  
Innovative Activities
The demand for innovative activities is closely 
tied to their ability to create profits for compa-
nies and benefits to society. Economic studies 
repeatedly show that the return from innovative 
activities—that is, the long-term payback to businesses from 
spending on research, development, and all sorts of other ac-
tivities that have the potential of producing innovations—is 
very high. For example, a dollar spent on R&D can yield an 
average return of 25–50 percent per year. That’s excellent. 
By comparison, the average annual return from investing in 
the stock market is about 10 percent.
However, most corporate executives view R&D spend-
ing with trepidation because the chances of failure are so 
high. Although the return on R&D spending is high, all 
sorts of things can go wrong when you try something new. 
In other words, the risk from innovative activities—the 
possibility that spending on R&D and 
other innovative activities will not pay 
off—is high.
The pharmaceutical industry under-
stands the risk of innovative activity 
well. Drug companies start with liter-
ally thousands of compounds they have 
reason to think might be good candi-
dates to treat illness. Then each com-
pound goes through a multistep, 
multiyear process that includes labora-
tory evaluation, animal testing, testing 
on humans, and then clinical trials to 
see whether the new drug safely does 
what it’s supposed to do and is measurably 
more effective than existing treatments. At any 
step along the way, a proposed compound can 
fail expensively, and many do. In the end, very 
few successful new drugs are introduced each 
year.
Corporate executives have another reason 
for being reluctant to put money into R&D and 
other innovative activities. In many cases, the 
company that pays for research may not get all 
or even most of the benefits. The private return from innova-
tive activities is the gain to the original company sponsoring 
the research, while the social return from innovation is the 
benefit to the whole economy. In general, the social return 
will be much greater than the private return because it’s dif-
ficult to keep good ideas fenced in.
Xerox is a classic example of a company that came up 
with great ideas but reaped little benefit from them. In the 
1970s, the Rochester, New York–based company had a re-
search facility in Palo Alto, California, that helped develop 
many great innovations for the personal computer, including 
the mouse and the graphical user interface. But Xerox, 
mainly focused on copiers at the time, was slow to take ad-
vantage of these innovations. Instead, Apple and Microsoft 
developed the graphical user interface and made big money 
from it. The social return to innovation was very high in this 
case, and the private return to the original inventor was low 
or practically zero.
Patents and Other Intellectual  
Property Protection
Companies are more likely to invest in creating innovative new 
products and services if they can make money with them. And 
making money is more likely if they can protect their innova-
tion from being copied, at least for a while. For this reason, 
the United States and other developed countries have several

different means of intellectual property protection— 
that is, laws that make it difficult to copy innovations.
The most important means of protection against copying 
is a patent, granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office 
(USPTO) to a person who “who invents or discovers any new 
and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of 
matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof.” Such a 
patent is a grant from the government that allows an inventor 
to control the use of his or her innovation for a set period, 
currently 20 years. In particular, the inventor has the “the 
right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, 
or selling the invention throughout the United States.”
Inventions protected by patents run the gamut from very 
important to totally weird. In the 1800s, Thomas Edison pat-
ented the electric lightbulb, the microphone used in tele-
phones, the phonograph, and the motion picture camera. 
AT&T patented the transistor, which was invented in AT&T’s 
Bell Labs in 1948. More recently, a researcher patented em-
bryonic stem cells. More oddly, patent #6960975 was granted 
to “a space vehicle propelled by the pressure of inflationary 
vacuum state”—in other words, an anti-gravity device.
Patents have two purposes. First, they allow an inventor 
to benefit from innovation by making it harder for others to 
duplicate it. If you have a patent on an invention, no one can 
use your invention without your permission until the patent 
runs out.
The second purpose of a patent is to encourage inventors to 
share ideas with the rest of society. You can license your in-
vention to others, allowing them to use it, and collect royalties 
from them (a share in their profits). Without patents, you might 
be tempted to conceal your idea to protect it from imitators.
The transistor patent is an interesting case. The three sci-
entists credited with inventing the transistor won a Nobel 
Prize for their achievement, but their employer, AT&T, 
never got any economic benefits. At the time, the company 
was fighting an antitrust suit, and it was sensitive about its 
public image. AT&T was, therefore, willing to license the 
patent rights to the transistor for a relatively low fee. Then, 
as part of the 1956 settlement of the antitrust suit, it let any-
one use the transistor patent without charge.
Intensity of Competition
Remember from Chapter 5 that in a competitive market, 
companies with a lower cost curve drive out ones with a 
higher cost curve over the long run. If you have an innova-
tion that allows you to offer the same or better product at a 
lower cost, you’ll be more successful in the marketplace.
Innovation is one of the key ways to get a competitive 
advantage. Boeing gets more orders by creating more fuel-
efficient airplanes than the ones sold by Airbus. One com-
puter manufacturer gets an advantage by designing a 
computer that is faster and cheaper than those of its rivals.
Thus, a key factor driving demand for innovative activi-
ties is intensity of competition. One of the most important 
benefits of economic competition is that it spurs faster cre-
ation and adoption of new technology by both existing firms 
and new firms. Let’s be blunt: Most companies would avoid 
the risk of innovation activity if they 
did not face the threat of competition.
A note of caution here: If a market is 
close to pure competition, profits may 
be low. If so, no companies may have 
enough extra money to spend on long-
run research. What’s more, rivals may 
immediately copy any new ideas that 
one company comes up with. As a re-
sult, economists sometimes worry that 
too much competition may slow down 
technological change.

Technological Change
the knowledge you create can be used 
by someone else as long as it is not re-
stricted by a patent.
Technological diffusion is the pro-
cess by which new ideas spread from 
one person or business to other parts of 
the economy. It sometimes seems as if 
any successful idea is immediately 
picked up and imitated by competitors. 
The initial high ratings for shows like American Idol, Top 
Chef, and Real Housewives of Orange County  spawned 
many similar projects. 
However, in most areas of the economy, technological 
diffusion takes longer than in entertainment. In medicine, 
for example, it takes a long time for doctors to adopt new 
and better treatments, even for common problems such as 
strokes and heart attacks.
The same thing is true in corporations. Economic studies 
show wide differences between the productivity levels of 
different factories making the same products. Some people 
and companies are more willing to take the risk of adopting 
a new technology, whereas others wait until that new tech-
nology is mature (see “How It Works: Innovation and 
Youth”). It can take 10, 20, even 30 years before an innova-
tion spreads through the whole economy. The process of 
technological diffusion is slow and gradual.
CONCLUSION
It’s impossible to imagine what today’s economy would be 
like without technological change, globalization, and finan-
cial markets, the topics of this chapter and the previous two. 
The most vivid example is the Internet, which was tiny 
15 years ago and now pervades our entire lives. At the same 
time, our ties to other countries have transformed the whole 
economy, while the ups and downs of the financial markets 
have had a pervasive impact. 
In particular, change affects all of us in our working 
lives—what type of work we do, how we are paid, who hires 
us, how we spend our days. In the next chapter, we will ex-
amine the labor market, which is one of the most important 
markets in the economy. That will help us better understand 
why some people are gaining from financial markets, glo-
balization, and technological change, while others seem to 
be worse off.
TECHNOLOGICAL 
DIFFUSION
The process by which 
new ideas spread 
from one person or 
business to other 
parts of the economy.
It often seems as if young people adopt new technolo-
gies faster than middle-aged or older workers. In part, 
that’s because the young have more malleable minds. 
But there are also economic reasons young workers 
get more benefits from spending time learning some-
thing new.
	
Think about it this way. A 25-year-old worker can 
­expect to be in the labor force for another 40 years. 
A 55-year-old worker can expect to be employed for 
another 10 or so years. That means the young worker 
will get many more years of benefits from learning how 
to use, say, instant messaging. That’s a big economic 
incentive.
	
In addition, the 55-year-old worker is typically paid 
more. That means the opportunity cost of his or her 
time is higher than for the 25-year-old. So, the older 
worker gets lower benefits and higher costs from 
spending time learning a new technology. That helps 
explain why many older workers seem to lag in 
­adopting current innovations.
HOW IT WORKS: 
INNOVATION AND YOUTH

SUMMARY
	 1.	Technological change is the introduction to the mar-
ket of new goods and services, or new processes of 
production, that did not exist before. Without techno-
logical change, it’s impossible to get big increases in 
living standards. The most recent wave of technologi-
cal change was the information revolution. Following 
Moore’s law, electronic devices get smaller, cheaper, 
faster, and more powerful every year. (LO15-1)
	 2.	Three types of innovation are productivity enhance-
ments, the creation of new goods and services, and 
quality-of-life improvements. (LO15-2)
	 3.	Traditionally, economists have treated technological 
change as a kind of black box, driven by nonmarket 
factors. But it has become clear in recent years that 
the creation of new knowledge is an economic activity 
or service that can be bought and sold just like any

other service. Innovative activities are any economic 
activities directed primarily at creating and developing 
new ideas, new knowledge, and new technology. 
(LO15-3)
	 4.	Innovative activities can be bought and sold in the 
market. The supply curve for innovative activities tells 
us the quantity of innovative activities that are sup-
plied, given their price. The supply curve for innova-
tive activities can be affected by the availability of 
scientists and engineers, access to venture capital, 
and location. (LO15-4)
	 5.	Similarly, the demand curve for innovative activities 
tells us the quantity of innovative activities that busi-
nesses will want to fund, given the price. The demand 
curve for innovative activities can be affected by the 
return from innovative activities, by patents and other 
forms of intellectual property protection, and by the 
intensity of competition. Unlike ordinary goods and 
services—which can be consumed by only one 
buyer—new technologies and ideas can spread from 
one person or business to the rest of the economy.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After reading this chapter, you should be able to:
LO16-1	
Define the labor supply and demand 
curves.
LO16-2	
Identify factors affecting labor market 
equilibrium.
LO16-3	
Explain why different workers may 
receive different wages.
LO16-4	
Describe effects of government 
regulation on the labor market.
LO16-5	
Identify the forces driving long-term 
labor supply.
­labor—are set by the interaction between 
supply and demand, just like prices in the 
market for fruit or for homes.
	
But there is, of course, a big difference 
between fruit and people: People have 
rights, and unlike fruit, they complain bit-
terly when they feel they’ve been unfairly 
treated. As a result, the labor market has 
some special characteristics, including 
rules regulating how many hours people 
can be required to work and the minimum 
wage they must be paid. In this chapter, 
we will explore the nature of the labor 
market in the United States and the global 
economy. In addition, we will explain the 
similarities and differences between the 
labor market and the other markets we’ve 
studied so far.
T
he labor market—the buying and sell-
ing of the time and effort of different 
kinds of workers—is the most important 
market in the economy. There is no pro-
ductive activity that does not require some 
input of labor.
	
True, the nature of work has changed 
over time: Many people go to school now to 
become nurses and medical technicians, 
­instead of finding a job in a factory just out 
of high school. There are literally tens of 
thousands of online want ads for “social 
­media managers,” a profession that barely 
existed in 2000. But, in the end, human 
­input is essential for all productive activities.
	
As this textbook was being revised in 
2016, the unemployment rate was hovering 
just below 5 percent. That was good news, 
showing that new jobs were being created. 
Still, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 
that average real wages for private-sector 
workers in 2016 were only slightly above 
pre-recession levels, leaving many 
­Americans with a sense of running in place.
	
Understanding the labor market, and 
how it evolves, is crucial for understand-
ing the world we live in. In many respects, 
the labor market functions the same way 
as the basic markets we described in 
Chapters 2 and 3. Wages—the price of

Economics of the Labor Market
THE BASICS OF THE LABOR 
MARKET  LO16-1 
When you’re looking for a job, it may feel as if the odds are 
against you. There are so few open positions, and so many 
applicants who want to be hired. A company advertising a 
desirable, high-paying job may receive hundreds or even 
thousands of résumés, especially when the economy is weak.
But turn the situation around, and imagine that you are a 
manager trying to fill an open position. You have a mental pic-
ture of the skills, experience, and personality the perfect job 
candidate will have. Yet that perfect person may be ­impossible 
to find, especially if you can’t pay a high enough wage to get 
the sort of person you want. As a result, some positions may 
stay open for months or even years. In April 2016, U.S. busi-
nesses reported almost 6 million open positions, even though 
8 million people were unemployed and searching for jobs.
In some ways, the labor market is a giant matching game 
in which job seekers hop from interview to interview, and 
managers roll prospective employees in and out of the ­office, 
with everyone looking for the right fit. The pain of matching 
is eased by such innovations as online job sites that make it 
easier to quickly scan many potential jobs and candidates. 
(See “Spotlight: The Rise of the Online Job Search.”)
The Labor Supply Curve
What happens before the job search? Let’s focus on the 
worker’s side of the labor market first. The worker’s first 
and most important decision is a simple one—should I 
look for a job or do something else? In other words, what is 
the opportunity cost of working? (In Chapter 2, we defined 
opportunity cost as the value or benefit of the next-best 
­alternative use of time or money.) ­Remember that people 
have ­alternatives to working a steady 
job. For example, they can go to col-
lege or graduate school. They can stay 
home with their kids or grandkids. 
They can be supported by their parents 
or other relatives, or they 
can receive Social Secu-
rity checks from the gov-
ernment. Or, especially if 
they are young or retired, 
they can travel or simply 
be at loose ends.
The labor force is the part of the adult population that 
is either working or actively looking for a job. An indi-
vidual chooses whether to be in the labor force or not. 
The labor force participation rate is the share of the 
adult population that is in the labor force. In the United 
States as of May 2016, 69 percent of men and 
57 percent of women 16 years old or over 
were in the labor force. These numbers 
­reflect the ­reality that, even today, it is still 
­socially more acceptable for women than for 
men to take off time from paid work, espe-
cially when raising children.

SPOTLIGHT: THE RISE OF 
THE ONLINE JOB SEARCH
Employers with a job opening used to have limited 
­options for filling it: They could put a help-wanted ad 
in the local newspaper, or they could ask friends and 
acquaintances whether they knew anyone who was 
qualified. Both avenues were chancy. Friends might not 
know anyone right for the job. And the best candidate 
might not read the newspaper that week—or worse, 
might live in a different city.
	
In 1994, a Boston area advertising executive named 
Jeff Taylor created an alternative: the Monster Board, 
an online site for matching job seekers with employers. 
At the beginning, it listed about 200 job openings, but, 
over time, it grew. In 1999, the site was renamed 
­Monster.com.
	
Other job search websites, such as Indeed.com, soon 
followed. As of June 2016, Indeed, which calls ­itself  
“the world’s #1 job site,” covered more than 60 coun-
tries. ­Indeed.com and sites like it improve the job search 
­process for employers and workers in several ways.
	
First, unlike newspaper classified ads, job search 
websites typically allow the job seeker to search for key 
job characteristics, such as desired skills. Second, a job 
seeker can potentially look at all national jobs or focus 
down on one geographic area. Economists agree that 
job search websites should result in faster, better job 
matches and a better-functioning labor market.
LO16-1
Define the labor 
supply and  
demand curves.
In 1969, workers without jobs were unemployed for less than eight weeks,  
on average. That’s the shortest time on record. By contrast, in mid-2008,  
an unemployed person was out of work for an average of 17 weeks.

Economics of the Labor Market	
285
The labor supply curve tells us, given the wage, how 
many people are in the labor force—that is, working or look-
ing for work (see Figure 16.1). Alternatively, it can tell us 
the total quantity of labor hours supplied (remember from 
Chapter 4 that labor can be measured by either people or 
hours). Generally speaking, the labor force participation rate 
of men between 25 and 54 is not very responsive to changes 
in pay. However, young people, women, and senior citizens 
are more likely to make decisions about whether to look for 
work based on the available pay. For example, the high-­
paying tech jobs of the 1990s caused many young people to 
forgo graduate school and go directly to work for a tech firm. 
Then when the economy went into recession in 2001 and 
information technology companies experienced a sharp drop 
in demand, young people started applying to graduate 
schools instead. Similarly, the Great Recession increased the 
number of people who wanted to go to business schools.
The labor force participation rate of adults over 65—a 
growing part of the workforce—is sensitive to the wages 
they might receive. That makes sense: They are already 
­receiving Social Security benefits and have a bit more 
­flexibility about whether they work.
In some jobs, such as retailing, it’s also possible to 
choose whether you work full-time or part-time. In these 
types of jobs, it is natural to write the labor supply curve in 
terms of the total quantity of working hours that people are 
willing to supply. So if three people are willing to work 
half-time—20 hours per week—at the going wage, that 
would be 60 hours per week of labor supplied.
The next decision is usually about what kind of job to 
look for. This is the job market decision. If you have an 
­accounting degree, for example, you could look for a job as 
an accountant. Or you could try to get work as a cashier, or a 
computer programmer, or a journalist, or an actor. Each of 
these jobs is in a different labor market.
Each labor market has its own labor supply curve. In its 
simplest form, the labor supply curve for a given job reports 
how many people are looking for that kind of job at a particu-
lar wage. (Or, if we think of labor supply as measured in hours, 
the labor supply curve reports the total quantity of hours of 
­labor people are willing to supply for that job at a particular 
wage.) The general rule is straightforward: If the wage for a job 
increases, more workers (or more hours) will be available for 
that job. This is the law of supply applied to the labor market.
Where do the additional workers come from? Some are 
lured into the labor market from other activities, such as school-
ing. Some switch from other lines of work. Schoolteachers 
sometimes become construction workers when the pay for 
construction climbs high enough. Economics and finance pro-
fessors move into high-paying Wall Street jobs; journalists go 
into public relations. Government officials are hired at much 
higher pay by firms that lobby their former agencies.
The Labor Demand Curve
Recall from Chapter 4 that businesses choose how many work-
ers to hire because they have identified the number of employ-
ees that will help maximize their profit. This may seem 
obvious, but plenty of employers, like governments and non-
profits, such as most hospitals, have goals 
other than profit when they hire workers.
Let’s look inside the mind of a man-
ager at a profit-making business deciding 
whether to hire an additional worker. On 
the plus side is the ­increased production 
or output that an extra worker generates. 
This is called the marginal product of 
labor. For example, the marginal prod-
uct of an added worker in a hair salon is 
the additional haircuts the salon can pro-
vide because of that worker. The mar-
ginal product of an extra stockbroker is 
the additional trades he or she brings into 
the brokerage house.
The marginal revenue of an addi-
tional worker is the extra revenue his or 
her efforts add to the business. In the 
simplest case, the marginal revenue is 
equal to the price of the output times 
the marginal product. For example, if 
the marginal product of an additional 
hairdresser is six haircuts per day, and 
the price of a haircut is $20, then the 
marginal revenue from hiring that 
added hairdresser is $120 per day.
To make the hiring decision, a man-
ager must compare the added revenue

Economics of the Labor Market
generated by an additional worker to 
the added cost of hiring that worker. The 
marginal cost of ­labor is the wage the 
company must pay the additional worker. 
(We will think of the wage as including 
the cost of benefits, such as employer-
provided health care insurance, and other 
supplements to the basic paycheck.)
In the short run, economic logic calls 
for the manager to keep hiring workers 
as long as the marginal revenue exceeds 
the wages paid to the workers (includ-
ing benefits). As long as that’s true, the 
additional workers will add to the profit 
of the business.
For jobs where workers are hired by 
the hour, such as ­retail sales clerks or 
waiters, the marginal revenue of labor is 
the extra revenue from one more hour of 
labor, while the marginal cost of ­labor is 
the hourly wage. The same rule ­applies: 
Managers will increase the quantity of 
hours demanded as long as marginal 
revenue exceeds marginal cost.
The labor demand curve, also shown in Figure 16.1, 
­reports, for each level of wages, how many workers busi-
nesses will want to hire, or the quantity of labor hours 
­demanded. Generally, as the wage rises, businesses will 
want to hire fewer workers or pay for fewer labor hours.
An Example of Labor Demand
Let’s work through an example of labor demand, using the 
case of a hair salon, as mentioned back in Chapter 2. The 
first two columns of Table 16.1 give the salon’s production 
function. The first column shows the number of hairdressers 
employed by the salon, while the second column, labeled 
output, gives the number of clients the salon can serve in a 
day (and assuming one haircut per client). The first hair-
dresser can take care of six customers in a day, and so can 
the second. A third hairdresser is a bit less productive be-
cause he keeps bumping into the other two and has to wait to 
use some of the equipment. These problems get a little more 
severe with each added hairdresser. As a result, the marginal 
product per hairdresser falls as more hairdressers are hired.
Suppose the market price for haircuts is $20 per cut; that’s 
cheap for many areas of the country. The fourth column 
shows the total revenue of the salon, assuming each client 
pays $20 per cut. The fifth column shows the marginal rev-
enue from adding each additional worker. We can see that 
marginal revenue declines as more workers are hired. The 
marginal revenue of the first worker hired is $120, whereas 
the marginal revenue of the fifth worker is only $60.
That’s the revenue side; what about the cost side? The Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics reports that the average ­national wage 
for hairdressers and cosmetologists was roughly $14  per 
hour. So let’s suppose the market wage for hairdressers is $98 
for a seven-hour day ($14 × 7 = $98). The market wage is 
the prevailing normal wage for a ­particular type of job. Then 
the marginal cost of each ­additional worker is $98 per day.
The salon owner will want to hire additional hairdressers 
as long as they increase his or her profit. In other words, the 
marginal revenue has to exceed the marginal cost. Looking 
down the table columns, we see that marginal revenue 
($120) exceeds marginal cost ($98) for the first worker. The 
same is true for the second and third workers. For the fourth 
worker, marginal revenue is less than marginal cost. So the 
TABLE 16.1
The Labor Demand Decision
Here’s how the owner of a hair salon might decide how many workers to hire, given the price of each haircut and the amount 
each worker gets paid. The rule is to keep hiring more workers as long as marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost

profit-maximizing owner hires the first three hairdressers 
and politely says no to the fourth.
We can check this conclusion by a different route. If we 
subtract total cost from total revenue, what’s left is profit. 
That’s the far right column of the table. We can 
see that the salon reaches its maximum profit 
with three workers—­precisely the same conclu-
sion as before.
So now we know that if the wage is $98 per 
day, the firm will hire three workers. A similar 
calculation shows us that if the wage is $70 per 
day, the firm will hire four workers ­(because 
the marginal revenue of the fourth worker is $80, which is 
greater than the wage, but the marginal revenue of the fifth 
would be only $60). And if the wage is $110 per day, the 
firm’s labor demand will be two workers (because the third 
worker has a marginal revenue of only $100). Higher wages 
lead to less hiring, and lower wages lead to more.
LABOR MARKET EQUILIBRIUM 
AND WAGES  LO16-2 
We’ve seen that in the labor market managers are busy mak-
ing hiring decisions, based on the going wage for a job. But 
where does that wage come from? In the world of econom-
ics, the answer is simple: The wage is set by the interaction 
of supply and demand in the labor market, just like any other 
market.
The basic mechanism is that the wage rises (or falls) 
to the point where the number of workers available for a 
­particular type of job is just equal to the number of workers 
that businesses are willing to hire. That is the labor market 
equilibrium as shown in Figure 16.1. (We’ll leave aside for 
the moment the fact that there are always some workers who 
are between jobs or unemployed.) Alternatively, for jobs that 
are hired by the hour, the labor market equilibrium is the 
wage at which the quantity of labor 
hours supplied is equal to the quantity 
of labor hours demanded.
The equilibrium wage W is affected 
by anything that affects the supply 
and demand curves, just as we described 
in Chapter 3. Consider, for example, 
the market for accountants in a city. 
The demand for accountants comes 
from accounting firms, companies 
that need accountants to do their 
books, ordinary people who need help 
with their taxes, and government 
agencies that need ­accountants to 
keep track of where the people’s tax 
money is going. The supply of ac-
countants includes people currently 
working as accountants, new gradu-
ates with accounting ­degrees, and people working in other 
lines of work who have accounting training.
Let’s suppose that the government passes legislation 
­requiring companies to document all their financial deci-
sions more closely. In fact, in 2002 Congress passed the 
Sarbanes–Oxley Act (known as Sarbox for 
short), which requires public corporations to 
meet much more rigorous financial account-
ing standards. To implement Sarbox, compa-
nies had to hire more accountants, which 
shifted the demand curve for accountants to 
the right (see Figure 16.2). The result of such 
FIGURE 16.2

ers businesses are 
willing to hire.

a shift? The equilibrium wage rises from W to W′, and the 
quantity of accountants rises from L to L′. In reality, that’s 
exactly what happened after the law was passed. Despite an 
overall weak labor market, the demand for accountants 
grew, pushing up salaries.
The Impact of Technological Change
Technological change can have a profound impact on both 
the labor supply schedule and the labor demand schedule. 
Think about the automobile, which came into widespread 
use in the early 1900s. As production ramped up, auto com-
panies hired many thousands of workers to make the engines 
and other parts for the new cars, and assemble them into a 
working vehicle. 
But that’s not all. Automobiles were powered by gasoline, 
which was refined out of crude oil. That meant businesses 
had to find many new workers for jobs that barely existed 
before: Oil rig workers, to get the crude oil out of the ground; 
refinery workers, to help produce the gasoline from the oil; 
and gas station attendants, to pump the gas. The demand for 
skilled mechanics increased dramatically because workers 
were needed who could repair the new “horseless carriages,” 
which were prone to regular breakdowns. At the same time, 
the increasing use of automobiles decreased demand for 
some types of jobs, such as making saddles and harnesses 
for horses.
More generally, technology can be either a substitute or a 
complement for labor. Technology is a substitute for labor if 
businesses hire fewer workers at the same wage. Technology 
is a complement for labor if businesses hire more workers at 
the market wage. For example, a bulldozer is a substitute for 
unskilled labor because, at any wage, it dramatically reduces 
the demand for workers with shovels. 
Or consider some more recent examples. The widespread 
use of automated telephone answering systems—voice 
mail—dramatically reduces the need for secretaries and 
phone operators because a caller can leave a message without 
talking to a person. (See “Economic Milestone: The First 
Voice-Mail System.”) However, new technology can also 
­increase the demand for certain kinds of workers. In recent 
years, there has been a great need for app developers—the 
people who create the mobile applications that run on your 
smartphone. 
Going forward, driverless vehicles, such as the ones being 
tested by Google, could lower the demand for truck drivers. 
At the same time, driverless vehicles could raise the demand 
for skilled mechanics to keep the driverless vehicles in very 
good shape. 
In general, most recent technological innovations have 
acted as substitutes for less-skilled labor and complements 
for high-skilled labor. That is, the voice-mail system elimi-
nated the job of the secretary, but not the job of the manager. 
Websites and mobile apps for buying airline tickets mean 
fewer reservation clerks are needed, but pilots are still in 
high demand. 
The speed of technological change benefits educated 
workers. In eras of rapid change, businesses want workers 
who can learn new technologies quickly. That generally 
boosts the demand for educated workers, who find it easier 
to adapt.
But here’s a question: Will future technological change 
continue to favor educated workers? Not necessarily. For de-
cades, science fiction writers and technological prophets 
have speculated about artificial intelligence software that 
could take over the functions of human managers and pro-
fessionals. So far, the capabilities of artificial intelligence 
have fallen far short of such hopes. But as computers grow 
more powerful, there may come a generation of artificial 
intelligence programs smart enough to substitute for human 
judgment.
The Impact of Globalization
Historically most labor markets were local. After all, 
whether you were a manager, a factory worker, or a secre-
tary, your employer expected you to physically show up at 
the place of business every day. But today, globalization and 
advances in communication technology make it possible for 
multinational companies to hire and communicate with 
THE SPEED OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE HAS BENEFITED  
EDUCATED WORKERS.
There was nearly a century between the invention of the telephone and the 
introduction of the first voice-mail system. Maybe that was too little time: In a 1997 
survey, U.S. adults called voice mail the number-one technology that should never 
have been invented. Nevertheless, voice mail is one of the clearest examples of 
technology substituting for labor. It has transformed the staffing of many offices by 
reducing the need for assistants.

workers across the country or on the other side of the world. 
And these are not just low-level production jobs. More and 
more U.S. companies are having their research and develop-
ment work done in Korea, Taiwan, China, or India.
As a result, when U.S. companies look to hire, they face a 
labor supply curve that has shifted to the right because a 
larger pool of workers is available globally for any job. We 
will call this the labor pool effect of globalization (see 
­Figure 16.3). Assuming no change in demand, the labor pool 
effect causes wages in the United States to drop because 
U.S. companies can now employ low-wage workers in 
China, India, and other developing countries.
But globalization can also have a positive impact on labor 
demand because U.S. companies can produce not just for the 
U.S. market but for the German, Chinese, and Indian mar-
kets as well. As we saw in Chapter 14, most large U.S. com-
panies, and many small ones, have tapped into overseas 
demand as a good way to increase sales.
We will call this the market expansion effect of global-
ization. Globalization means more potential customers, 
more potential sales—and potentially more labor demanded 
by U.S. companies. This translates into a rightward shift of 
the labor demand curve for U.S. companies, as shown in 
Figure 16.4. Assuming no change in labor supply, this can 
drive up the wage the companies pay.
The overall impact of globalization on wages depends on 
whether the market expansion effect is stronger than the 
­labor pool effect. For U.S. manufacturing workers, the labor

pool effect has been greater than the 
market expansion effect. U.S. manufac-
turers are selling a lot of goods over-

factories to produce those goods. So 
while total revenue for these firms is 
going up, the demand for U.S. factory 
labor is going down.
But plenty of workers in the United 
States have benefited from access to 
the global economy. For example, big

been very successful at operating abroad, and 
the resulting profits have created new jobs and 
higher wages at home. (See “Spotlight: The 
Global Movie Star” for another example of a 
winner from globalization.)
WHY NOT ALL WORKERS 
ARE THE SAME  LO16-3 
Suppose there is a sudden increase in the demand for expe-
rienced accountants. That will likely boost the wages for 
­accountants, but it will probably not affect the pay for nurses. 
Similarly, an increase in the demand for nurses is unlikely to 
boost the pay for accountants.
Accountants and nurses are not competing for the same 
jobs. Each occupation requires different skills, qualifica-
tions, and experience. That’s not to say an accountant can’t 
retrain to be a nurse, or vice versa. But it’s a slow process, 
and most people won’t do it.
The labor markets for accountants and for nurses are 
­noncompeting labor markets. Two labor markets are non-
competing if the workers in one market 
do not compete for jobs in the other.
In fact, the overall U.S. labor market 
is really a collection of many smaller la-
bor markets. Surgeons don’t compete for 
the same jobs as fast-food cooks. Airline 
pilots don’t compete for the same jobs as 
major league baseball players.
This lack of competition helps explain the 
big differences in what different workers are 
paid. Surgeons got paid an average of $250,000 
per year in 2015, whereas fast-food cooks made 
an average of $20,000—but a cook can’t apply 
for a job as a surgeon, even if he or she is good 
with knives. Similarly, airline pilots and flight 
engineers earn, on average, $136,000 per year, 
whereas the average pay for major league 
baseball players at the start of the 2016 season was more 
than $4 million—but no one would suggest that a highly 
skilled pilot would make a good second basemen.
Education
But why should there be separate labor markets? To put this 
another way, what’s to stop any worker from competing for a 
highly paid job? Some labor markets, like those for profes-
sional athletes or opera singers, are walled off by the need to 
have particular skills that are rare and cannot be easily 
acquired.
More generally, in today’s labor market, education has 
become the key qualification that workers need. Employers 
for many good jobs increasingly want to see a bachelor’s or 
associate degree, depending on the position. There were 
once a sizable number of well-paid U.S. factory jobs that 
required at most a high school diploma, but those jobs have 
mostly melted away, and there is a much tighter link between 
education and income than before.
Obtaining an education, especially a college or graduate 
degree, can be an expensive proposition, but it can also yield 
SPOTLIGHT: THE GLOBAL MOVIE STAR
At least so far, some of the biggest winners from the mar-
ket expansion effect have been U.S. movie stars. Consider 
Johnny Depp, star of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. 
The four movies took in impressive box office revenues of 
$1.3 billion in the United States. But overseas box office 
revenues were an astonishing $2.5 billion, according to 
Box Office Mojo, an online movie publication. No wonder 
Depp now ranks as one of the best-paid U.S. actors.
	
So far, U.S. movie stars haven’t suffered much from the 
labor pool effect. Stars like Depp don’t fear competition 
from Indian film stars such as Shah Rukh Khan, who has 
won India’s equivalent of the best actor prize six times 
(though some immigrant actors have done well in the 
United States, such as English-born Daisy Ridley, one of 
the stars of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, originally from Austria).
	
It’s not impossible to imagine that Bollywood—India’s 
equivalent of the Hollywood movie machine—or some 
other filmmaking region could start producing viable 
global stars. But it hasn’t happened yet.

high returns in terms of better pay and benefits and lower 
unemployment. For example, according to the U.S. Census 
Bureau, the average full-time worker with a bachelor’s 
­degree earned $74,359 in 2014. A similar worker with only 
a high school diploma earned $43,661. The added pay for 
getting a college degree is the education premium. Over a 
40-year work career, the average college graduate, whether 
male or female, earns far more than the average high school 
diploma holder.
To be sure, Figure 16.5 shows that the education pre-
mium has not widened since 2000. However, higher wages 
are not the only benefit of earning a college degree. Data 
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that better-­
educated workers also have a lower unemployment rate, as 
Table 16.2 reveals.
Why should college-educated workers get paid so much 
more? One possible reason is that college teaches skills and 
knowledge that make future workers more productive. That 
shifts the demand curve for college-educated workers to the 
right, driving up their wage and making them less likely to 
be unemployed.
But that’s not the only possible explanation. Perhaps col-
lege doesn’t teach much but, instead, provides a way of iden-
tifying smart people who are able to follow directions. That 
is, a college degree signals to future employers that you are 
smart enough and dedicated enough to pass four years’ 
worth of classes. In essence, college is one long test.
But no matter what the explanation, the question remains: 
If going to college has such a big payoff, why doesn’t ­everyone 
get a college degree? One reason, of course, is that going to 
school is an expensive proposition. The cost of tuition, text-
books, and other supplies can be sizable. (Room and board—
the cost of housing and eating—would 
have to be paid whether or not the stu-
dent is in school.)
The biggest cost, though, is the 
value of the earnings you’ve lost be-
cause you are in school rather than 
EDUCATION PREMIUM
The added lifetime 
pay for getting a 
­college degree.

292	
CH 16

working. This is the opportunity cost of 
education. If it takes 25 hours a week to 
complete a full-time program, you have 
25 fewer hours a week to work for pay. 
So the true economic cost of college is 
tuition and all its other costs plus for-
gone earnings.
Incidentally, the opportunity cost of 
education helps explain why it’s easier 
to go to school when you’re young. Your wage is lower when 
you’re young, so you lose less money by going to school in 
your teens and 20s than you would if you went later. In other 
words, you might be giving up a $15,000-a-year job at Mc-
Donald’s to go to college now rather than a $60,000-a-year 
job as a stockbroker.
Age and Experience
Does experience make a difference? Older 
workers do earn more than younger workers—
up to a point. Data from the Census Bureau 
show that wages generally hit their peak when 
workers are between 45 and 54 (see Figure 
16.6). Pay levels off or falls a bit in people’s 
late 50s and early 60s, before retirement. For 
example, in 2014, workers with a college education and a 
full-time job who were between 45 and 54 years old earned 
an average of about $83,265 per year. Comparably educated 
workers ­between 55 and 64 earned only $75,642 a year.
There are plenty of reasons pay should rise with age. 
­Experience clearly improves performance, up to a point. 
Many jobs require a learning curve, often years long, before 
you achieve full proficiency. One suggestive fact is that it 
takes roughly 10 years to achieve expert competence in a 
game where strategy and analysis are important, such as 
chess. Moreover, the longer you work at a particular com-
pany, the more you build up firm-specific experience—
knowledge of how to get things done within that company. 
Most firms value this knowledge in their employees.
Finally, research has shown that verbal and interpersonal 
skills stay at high levels as people age. In the 1984 presiden-
tial debates, Ronald Reagan, then 73 years old, 
quipped, “I will not make age an issue of this 
campaign. I am not going to exploit, for politi-
cal purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexpe-
rience.” At the time his opponent, Walter 
­Mondale, was 56 years old. In the 2016 presi-
dential race, the candidates of the two major 
political parties, Hillary Clinton and Donald 
Trump, were 69 and 70 years old, respectively, 
on election day.
But as workers age, other types of physical and cognitive 
capabilities decline. Reasoning abilities, mental speed, and 
the ability to remember events drop off significantly before 
50 years of age. Painters, musicians, and writers seem to 
achieve their peak creative output in their 30s and 40s. 
Moreover, in a fast-changing economy, knowledge and expe-
rience depreciate quickly. As we saw in Chapter 15, young 
people have more incentive than do older workers to invest 
in learning new technologies because they have more time 
left in the workforce to use their new knowledge.
REGULATION OF THE LABOR 
MARKET  LO16-4 
The labor market is one of the most intensely regulated parts 
of the economy. There are rules governing everything from 
work hours to child labor to the minimum wage to employ-
ment discrimination to retirement benefits. In Chapter 6, we 
discussed the role of government in the economy; here we’ll 
explore some rules and laws that specifically govern labor 
markets.
The Minimum Wage
Let’s start with the minimum wage, the clearest case of 
­government regulation. The minimum wage law sets a floor 
for hourly wages for most workers. When introduced in 
­October 1938, the federal minimum wage was 25 cents per 
hour! But that wasn’t as low as it sounds—the average wage

in manufacturing at that time was 62 cents per hour. As of 
June 2016, the federal minimum wage was $7.25 per hour. 
Some states, such as California, had minimum wages as high 
as $10 per hour. Washington, DC’s minimum wage is sched-
uled to rise to $15 per hour by 2020. 
What effect does the minimum wage have on the labor 
market? This is one of the most hotly debated topics in eco-
nomics. The basic supply–demand analysis is straight- 
forward: A minimum wage lifts the wages of the lowest-paid 
workers above their market wage. As a result, employers 
have to cut back on their hiring because the marginal reve-
nue of some workers is below their wage.
A minimum wage creates a situation of excess supply in 
the labor market. The higher wage lowers the quantity of 
­labor demanded and raises the quantity supplied. In other 
words, some people who want jobs can’t get them.
The usual example is a fast-food restaurant, which em-
ploys a lot of low-paid young workers to stay open long 
hours. If the minimum wage were increased, it might not be 
profitable for the restaurant to stay open quite so late. The 
result would be fewer work hours, and perhaps fewer work-
ers hired.
Figure 16.7 shows graphically the impact of instituting  
a minimum wage. L is the equilibrium employment without 
the minimum wage law, and W is the equilibrium wage. When 
a minimum wage law is imposed that raises the wage to W′, 
that lowers the quantity of labor demanded from L to L′.
However, we don’t know whether the drop from L to L′ is 
big or small. A series of studies done in the 1990s suggested 
that raising the federal minimum wage by a moderate amount 
would have only a small negative effect on employment, if any. 
There are a few reasons. First, not many workers nationally 
actually earn the minimum wage. According to the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, only 3 percent of hourly workers were paid at 
or below the minimum federal wage in 2015. Second, many 
employers seem to be relatively insensitive to small or moder-
ate changes in the minimum wage when it comes to making 
hiring decisions. Third, the minimum wage in June 2016, 
­adjusted for inflation, was still below its peak.
In the end, it seems that the current level of minimum 
wage gives an acceptable trade-off between improving pay 
for some low-income workers while pushing down employ-
ment a bit. However, there is no consensus among econo-
mists about how high the minimum wage can be boosted 
without causing significant job loss.
The Working Day
Of course, the minimum wage is not the only example of 
government regulating labor markets. Consider the length of 
the working day. Today, the 8-hour day and the 40-hour 
workweek are ingrained into our culture. But those condi-
tions are the result of hard-fought and sometimes violent 
disputes between unions and employers. In 1886, nationwide 
demonstrations to shorten the workweek—which then aver-
aged 60 hours—turned into riots around the country. And it 
wasn’t until 1938 that the federal government passed effec-
tive rules to set a 40-hour workweek, with a requirement for 
overtime pay for many workers.
What effect does regulating the workweek have on the la-
bor market? Suppose a new law reduces the legal workweek 
to 35 hours. Then the employer would have two choices. She 
could pay overtime wages to encourage everyone to work five 
more hours, which would obviously be more expensive. Or 
she could hire and train extra workers to make up for everyone 
else’s reduced hours. Training is ­expensive; so is paying ben-
efits such as health care to more workers. As a result, limita-
tions on work hours impose extra expenses on businesses.
This is exactly what happened in France, which put a 
35-hour workweek into effect at the beginning of 2000. 
Many companies struggled with the law, and by 2005, the 
government relaxed the standard, saying that it was making 
businesses less competitive.
Licensing
Government often intervenes in labor markets by setting 
­licensing requirements for certain professions. That  
is, you need to receive permission 
from the government before doing cer-
tain jobs (see “Spotlight: Licenses for 
Manicurists”).
It makes sense to license certain 
­occupations, such as doctors and 
­pharmacists. You want to know that the 
doctor who treats you has at least a

minimum amount of training and experience. The same is 
true for the pharmacist who fills your drug prescriptions. It 
can also be argued that ­restricting who can practice law 
makes sense.
But, sometimes, the oddest professions require licenses. 
In the state of California, for example, you need to be licensed 
to be a boxing matchmaker, a brake lamp adjuster, or an 
­esthetician (someone who works in a beauty salon). You 
need a license or permit to run a cemetery or an electronics 
repair business, sell mattresses or bedding, process ancho-
vies, or manufacture margarine. It’s not hard to imagine that 
the true purpose of some licensing requirements is to restrict 
competition by making it more difficult for people to qualify 
for certain occupations.
Unions
A union is a group of workers that bar-
gains collectively with employers for 
wages (including benefits) and working 
conditions. At one point, unions were 
extremely important in the economy. In 
the 1950s, for example, roughly one-third of workers 
­belonged to unions, compared to 12 percent today. Only 
7 percent of private-sector workers belonged to unions in 
2015, compared to 35 percent in the public sector. Indeed, 
the largest union is the National Education Association, 
which has roughly 3 million members, mainly teachers.
Wage setting with collective bargaining is very different 
from wage setting in a competitive market like the ones 
we’ve discussed in this chapter so far. In collective bargain-
ing, the employer talks with the representatives of the union 
to come up with an acceptable deal. The employer’s ulti-
mate resort is to fire the workers, and the ultimate threat of 
the union is to walk off the job or go on strike and deprive 
the employer of skilled and experienced labor.
Bargaining takes place against a backdrop of laws and 
regulations that determine what is acceptable: When is it 
­legal for an employer to hire replacement workers? When is 
it legal for a union to picket a workplace? All this is gov-
erned in the United States by the National Labor Relations 
Act of 1935 and the Taft-Hartley Act of 1946. Compliance 
is monitored by the National Labor Relations Board, whose 
members are appointed by the president. In addition, indi-
vidual states are allowed to pass “right-to-work” laws, which 
mean that employees cannot be compelled to join a union.
When they’re effective, unions can raise pay and improve 
working conditions for current workers. By definition, that 
means pushing wages above the equilibrium market level, as 
Figure 16.8 shows. 
FIGURE 16.8 
The Impact of Union 
Membership on Wages
In some cases, unions can push up wages. However, the 
­resulting employment level will be less than the competitive 
market equilibrium.

SPOTLIGHT: LICENSES FOR 
MANICURISTS
To see how occupational licensing requirements work, 
let’s take a look at manicurists, also known as “nail 
technicians.” Most states prohibit someone from work-
ing as a manicurist unless he or she has passed certain 
hurdles. In Arkansas, for example, budding manicurists 
must take 600 hours of course instruction at an approved 
school of cosmetology. In addition, they have to pass 
both a written and a practical exam. 
	
The licensing requirements are not trivial. A required 
manicurist course might cost $4,000 and consume the 
equivalent of 75 full working days, or more than three 
months. Studying for the written and practical exams 
­requires time and materials as well.
	
What are the arguments for and against licensing? 
On the plus side, the licensing requirements force man-
icurists to learn at least the basics of health and safety. 
That’s a good thing at a time when people are more 
worried than ever about being infected with something 
that is not easily treatable. Licensing also enforces 
some minimum of skill at doing nail care.
	
On the minus side, the licensing requirement 
­reduces the supply of manicurists because it rules out 
people who don’t have enough money or time to pay 
for the course. This, in turn, has the effect of driving up 
the wages paid to manicurists, which in turn raises the 
price of a manicure.
UNION
A group of workers 
who bargain collec-
tively with employers 
for wages, benefits, 
and working 
conditions.

Under what conditions can unions be effective at raising 
wages? First, it has to be difficult for a company to hire re-
placement workers. In the airline industry, the pilots’ union 
is generally more effective at raising wages than is the flight 
attendants’ union. Planes can fly with substitute flight atten-
dants, but it’s much harder to replace trained pilots at short 
notice. That gives the pilots more leverage in bargaining for 
wage increases.
Second, unions are more effective when it is difficult for 
nonunion competitors to enter an industry. The public sector 
is heavily unionized, in part because there is little or no com-
petition for most government functions. Private companies 
can do some government jobs, like waste collection, but it is 
much less usual to have a private company handle police or 
fire protection or even public school education. The scarcity 
of other options for getting the work done is another way in 
which unions gain bargaining leverage.
Why has private-sector unionization fallen 
sharply in recent years? Globalization is one 
key reason. When whole factories can move to 
other countries, the possibility of a union strike 
becomes much less threatening to employers. 
That helps explain why strikes have become far 
less common in recent years. Figure 16.9 shows 
that work stoppages due to strikes have become 
both less common and shorter in the last 50 years. The only 
recent exception was 2000, when actors working in radio 
and television commercials went on strike for half the year. 
Despite this strike, however, there is no evidence that fewer 
commercials were made or shown in that year.
LONG-TERM LABOR  
SUPPLY  LO16-5 
To end this chapter, we will look at the 
long-term labor supply: the predicted 
size of the labor force in a country or a 
region at some point in the future. 
Economists and businesses worry about the long-term labor 
supply because it affects the growth rate of the economy, 
future tax revenues, and the ability of businesses to find 
workers.
Working-Age Population
As we saw earlier in this chapter, the labor force depends on 
the size of the population and the labor force participation 
rate. However, for long-term forecasts of the labor supply, 
economists usually focus on changes in the size 
of working-age population (ages 20–64).
In 1980, when the baby boom generation 
was hitting adulthood in large numbers, the 
working age population was growing at 1.8 per-
cent per year. The second peak came around 
2005, when the children of the baby boom gen-
eration were entering the workforce.
Going forward, however, the rate of growth of the working-
age population is expected to slow sharply. There are two 
implications of this slowdown in the growth rate of the 
working-age population. First, it may become difficult for 
businesses to find enough skilled and educated workers in 
FIGURE 16.9 Days of Work Lost to Work Stoppages, 1965–2015

the United States, especially as older workers retire. This 
will put more pressure on workers to get an education.
Second, as we will see in Chapter 18, this slowdown will 
make it harder to pay for Social Security and Medicare be-
cause these programs are funded by payroll taxes paid by 
workers. Fewer workers will mean less payroll tax available 
to help support retirees.
The Impact of Immigration
Ultimately, the long-term labor supply depends on two 
­factors—the number of births and the number of immigrants 
from other countries. In recent years, immigration into the 
United States has been quite high. Pulled by economic 
­opportunity in the United States and a lack of good jobs in 
their own countries, the foreign-born labor force increased 
by 4.2 million workers between 2005 and 2015. By compari-
son, the native-born labor force increased by 3.6 million 
over the same period. In other words, without immigration, 
the growth rate of the labor force in the United States would 
have been much slower.
Immigration is a highly controversial topic, not just in the 
United States but around the world. In 2015 Europe grap-
pled with an influx of well over 1 million refugees and 
­migrants from Syria and other countries. This surge gener-
ated heated political debate about the economic and cultural 
impacts of immigration. 
From the economic perspective, immigration clearly 
shifts the labor supply curve to the right—in a big way. All 
other things being equal, this decreases wages while increas-
ing the level of employment in the host country. Economic 
research has not nailed down the size of this wage effect 
from immigration, though it’s certainly real.
This concern about immigration driving down wages fuels 
much of the political debate over immigration policy. People 
are worried that the influx of foreign-born workers makes it 
harder for native-born workers to get paid well. Low-skilled 
workers worry about competition from low-skilled immi-
grants, while native-born workers with a college education 
are concerned about competition from immigrants who 
­received college degrees in their own countries. 
But that’s not where the story stops. Immigration also 
shifts the national demand curve for labor to the right, which 
helps push up wages. Why? Immigrants are consumers as 
well as workers. They buy homes: 51 percent of foreign-born 
families in the United States owned their homes as of 2013. 
They buy food and furniture, use telephones and banks, and 
shop for cars and toys. As a result, immigrants not only in-
crease the supply of labor, they increase the ­demand for 
goods and services and, therefore, the demand for labor. This 
may be especially true in cities such as New York and Los 
Angeles, which have vibrant immigrant communities.
These two opposing effects of immigration help explain 
why there is much disagreement among economists about the 
actual impact of immigration on wages. Reputable estimates 
range from a big negative impact to almost no impact at all.
Location
Another aspect of the long-term labor supply is location. 
People move around. They change jobs and relocate from one 
area of the country to another—from Texas to California or 
from Cleveland to New York City. They graduate from col-
lege and move to a city where they’ve landed a good job or 
where their spouse or friend has gotten a good job. Or they 
take a big leap and change countries—moving from Mexico 
to the United States or from the United States to China or 
some other country where the opportunities seem better.
As people move, the supply of labor in a region or coun-
try changes over months or years. If a region is attractive to 
enough people—because of climate, job opportunities, cost 
of living, or presence of cultural institutions—the local labor 
supply will grow. The development and widespread use of 
air-conditioning in the 1930s made warm-weather states like 
Florida and Georgia more attractive because people could be 
comfortable during the hot summers.
Meanwhile, certain areas of the country are losing 
­working-age population because of their lack of jobs,

­combined with colder climates. That’s especially true in the 
manufacturing areas of the U.S. Midwest and many rural 
counties. For example, the population of the city of Cleve-
land fell by 17 percent between 2000 and 2010 and then fell 
by another 2 percent between 2010 and 2015, according to 
the Census Bureau. According to government statisticians, 
1,300 rural counties lost population between 2000 and 2014.
Where do they go? Young college graduates like to live 
where there are lots of other young college-educated people 
(if you are single, you certainly understand). Similarly, edu-
cated workers go where they can find cultural opportunities, 
which creates enough demand to attract even more cultural 
opportunities.
CONCLUSION
Every worker, from the president of the United States to the 
housekeepers in the local hotel, participates as a seller in the 
labor market. Similarly, almost every business, from the larg-
est down to almost the smallest, is a buyer in the labor mar-
kets. Indeed, labor markets are pervasive in today’s economy.
But something else is pervasive as well: the sense that some-
one else is being paid more than you. In the U.S. economy, 
there’s a very wide gap between the highest- and lowest-paid 
workers. That fact distresses many people and may be a social 
problem—and that’s why the next chapter will take up the 
tough problem of the distribution of income and inequality.

SUMMARY
	 1.	The labor force is the part of the population that is ei-
ther working or actively looking for a job. The labor 
force participation rate is the share of the population 
in the labor force. The labor supply curve tells us, 
given the wage, how many people are in the labor 
force or the total number of labor hours supplied. The 
labor demand curve reports how many workers busi-
nesses want to hire, given the wage. Businesses want 
to expand their employment as long as the marginal 
revenue from an additional worker exceeds the wage 
paid to the worker (including benefits). (LO16-1)
	 2.	Labor market equilibrium is affected by various fac-
tors, including government legislation, technological 
change, and globalization. For example, the market 
expansion effect of globalization causes the labor de-
mand curve to shift to the right, boosting equilibrium 
employment and wages. (LO16-2)
	 3.	Workers differ by education, age, and experience. 
Higher-educated workers get paid more, but the 
education premium has not widened since 2000. 
(LO16-3)
	 4.	The labor market is heavily regulated. The minimum 
wage law sets a floor for hourly wages for most 
workers. This has the effect of raising wages for a 
small number of workers and somewhat reducing 
employment. Another regulation limits the work-
week for many workers and requires the payment of 
overtime rates for anything above that. A union is a 
group of workers that bargains collectively with em-
ployers for wages (including benefits) and working 
conditions. An effective union can raise pay above 
the equilibrium level, which reduces employment. 
(LO16-4)
	 5.	The long-term labor supply is expected to grow more 
slowly in coming years. That will affect the ability of 
businesses to find enough skilled and educated work-
ers. One critical factor determining future labor supply 
is the number of immigrants. (LO16-5)

others earn very little, or is it unfair to take 
money away from people who have earned 
it to give it to others who have less?
	
In this chapter, we’ll lay out the basic 
facts about the distribution of income in 
the United States. We’ll discuss some rea-

in recent years, and we’ll examine the 
­justifications for income redistribution. 
Then we’ll finish with a look at racial and

n 2015, Dara Khosrowshahi, chief exec-
utive officer of Expedia, was paid ap-
proximately $95 million. In the same year, 
roughly one-third of all U.S. households 
had incomes of $30,000 or less.
	
That gap—between $95 million and 
$30,000—demonstrates the wide spread 
of incomes in the U.S. economy. In recent 
years, the economy has produced a 
growing number of very high-income win-
ners: corporate executives, athletes and 
entertainers, hedge-fund and private 
­equity managers, and technology entre-
preneurs. Mark Zuckerberg, founder of 
Facebook, went from college student to 
billionaire in just three years. That’s the 
good news.
	
Unfortunately, there seems to be a 
growing gap between the people with 
very high incomes and everyone else. In 
particular, the country’s overall prosperity 
seems to have missed a large number of 
low-income households. The percentage 
of U.S. citizens living in poverty—that is, 
with incomes below the official poverty 
line—is actually higher today than it was 
for most of the 1970s.
	
This income gap is one of the most 
­important topics in economics, yet it is 
also one of the most controversial. Does

The Distribution of Income
THE BASICS OF INCOME 
DISTRIBUTION  LO17-1 
The starting point for any discussion of U.S. 
­incomes is the data produced each year by the 
statisticians at the Census Bureau. Each year, the 
department asks a sample of American house-
holds about their income—that is, how much money they re-
ceived in the previous year from various sources such as their 
jobs, the interest on their savings accounts, the dividends on 
their stocks, their Social Security payments, and their profits if 
they own businesses. This sample is large enough to let the 
statisticians draw conclusions about the whole population. 
Then the Census Bureau reports its findings, together with in-
formation about the characteristics of the households (a house-
hold is a group of people living together in one housing unit).
Figure 17.1 shows some basic infor-
mation about the income distribution—
that is, a description of the share of 
households at different income levels. 
For each level of income in 2014, Fig-
ure 17.1 reports two numbers: the share 
of households in that income category, 
and their share of the country’s total 
­income. For example, 47 percent of 
households received between $0 and 
$50,000 in 2014. These households, 
taken together, received 15 percent of 
U.S. total income.
At the upper end of the distribution, 
roughly 3 percent of households in the 
United States had income greater than 
$250,000 in 2014. But that relatively small 
number of people also received 16 percent of 
the country’s total income, much bigger than 
their share of the number of households.
Quintiles
Figure 17.1 looks at the distribution of income 
in terms of monetary ranges. But economists also like to 
think about income distribution in terms of quintiles. A 
quintile represents 20 percent of households. For example, 
the bottom quintile is the 20 percent of families with the 
lowest incomes. The top quintile is the 20 percent of fami-
lies with the highest annual incomes (the top quintile is 
usually also subdivided into the top 5 percent and the top 
1 percent).
Table 17.1 shows the minimum income needed to get into 
each quintile in 2014. If you worked full-time and earned the 
national minimum wage ($7.25 an hour at the end of 2014), 
your total earnings for the year would be $14,500, which is 
in the first quintile. A household income of at least $21,430 
is needed to get you into the second quintile.
On the other hand, 5 percent of U.S. households earn in-
comes of $206,570 or higher. This category includes highly 
educated households. Many lawyers, successful small busi-
ness owners, and doctors fall in the top 5 percent (the aver-
age salary of an obstetrician–gynecologist was in excess of 
$222,000 in 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics). Many highly paid corporate managers are in the top 
5 percent as well. (See “Spotlight: CEO Pay.”)
The top 5 percent also includes virtually all major league 
athletes. For example, the minimum salary for major league 
baseball players in 2016 was about $500,000. That number

households for sure. 
Finally, the top 5 percent of households also includes quite 
a few two-earner families, in which both members of a cou-
ple work at good jobs. That is, if both people earn $105,000 a 
year, that would push a household into the top 5 percent.
One Way to Measure Inequality
Income inequality, generally speaking, is the disparity be-
tween high-income and low-income households or individ-
uals. There are several different ways to measure the degree 
of income inequality, but here’s one of the most widely used. 
Remember that a quintile represents one-fifth or 20 percent 
of households. The income level that marks the dividing 
line between the bottom quintile and the second quintile 
is called the 20th percentile because 20 percent, or one-
fifth, of households fall below that level (see Figure 17.2). 
The ­income level that marks the dividing line between the 
top quintile and everyone else is called the 80th percentile 
because 80 percent of households 
have incomes below that level. In 
2014, the income level for the 20th 
percentile was $21,430, and the in-
come level for the 80th percentile was 
$112,260.

SPOTLIGHT: CEO PAY
Among the best-paid workers in the United States are the 
chief executive officers (CEOs) of big companies. They 
typically get salary and bonuses, often running into the 
millions of dollars. In addition, they usually are granted 
stock in their companies, or the option to buy stock at a 
fixed price. This stock-related pay can be very valuable. 
	
In 2015, the typical CEO at a large company was paid 
$19.3 million, according to calculations by The New York 
Times. By contrast, the average pay of workers without 
managerial responsibility was less than $37,000.  
	
Indeed, one of the biggest changes in the economy 
over the past 20 years has been the widening gap 
­between pay for top corporate executives and the 
­average pay of American workers. What are large com-
panies paying for? First, running a large multinational 
corporation successfully is a tough job. Corporate 
boards (who hire CEOs) perceive that few people have 
the experience and leadership ability to do this work.  
In other words, the labor supply is relatively skimpy. So 
it’s worth paying a lot to hire and retain a good CEO.
	
A second possible reason for high CEO pay could 
be called the tournament effect. By making the CEO 
job so lucrative and therefore desirable, high salaries in 
effect set up a tournament in which many middle-level 
managers compete hard to make it up the ladder. Thus, 
well-paid jobs at the top stimulate work effort through-
out an entire organization
	
Another justification for huge pay packages—­
especially for pay in the form of stock and stock options— 
is the need to give corporate managers incentives to 
make decisions in the best interest of shareholders. 
A CEO who owns stock options or stock in his or her 
company will be more motivated to manage the firm 
so as to boost the company’s share price, which is what 
shareholders want.
	
The final reason for high pay is simple. In many 
­corporations, the CEO controls who gets to sit on the 
board of directors. And guess who votes on CEO pay? 
The board of directors. This sort of arrangement helps 
explain why CEO pay keeps going up.

INCOME INEQUALITY
The disparity between 
high-income and low-
income households or 
individuals.

304	
CH 17 
The Distribution of Income
We can think of the households in the 
top quintile as “high-income” and the 
households in the bottom quintile as 
“low-income.” From that perspective, we 
can calculate the 80/20 ratio—that is, 
the 80th percentile of income divided 
by the 20th percentile of income. For 
Figure 17.2, the 80/20 ratio is $112,260/ 
$21,430, which is roughly 5.2, or just 
over 5. In other words, high-income households have an in-
come that is at least five times that of low-income households.
An 80/20 ratio of 5 means that high-income households 
earn a lot more than low-income ones. By contrast, if the 
80/20 ratio is close to 1, high-income and low-income 
households have relatively similar incomes, and the degree 
of inequality is low.
CHANGING INCOME  
INEQUALITY  LO17-2 
Most economists believe the distribution of income has wid-
ened over the past 40 years. In other words, income inequal-
ity has increased. However, there is no consensus about 
whether the increase in inequality has been 
large or small. It depends on which data source 
you look at and which measure of inequality 
you use.
The 80/20 Ratio
Let’s start by looking at the 80/20 ratio, which 
the Census Bureau calculates each year based 
on its survey of income. Figure 17.3 shows that 
the 80/20 ratio has been rising over time, which means the 
spread between high-income and low-income households 
has been widening. In 1985 high-income households had in-
comes at least 4.4 times those of low-income households. 
By 2014, that difference had widened appreciably.
However, Figure 17.3 does not indicate a dramatic in-
crease in inequality. High-income households have seen 
their incomes rise faster than their low-income counter-
parts over the past 40 years, but the difference is not that 
great.
An Alternative View
Some economists have disputed this relatively benign view 
of slow-rising inequality. They look at tax return data from 
the Internal Revenue Service, under the reasonable assump-
tion that people are more likely to be truthful to tax collec-
tors about their incomes than to surveyors from the 
government.
Based on tax return data, the share of reported income 
going to the top 1 percent has risen sharply over the past 
40 years. In 1975, the top 1 percent of taxpayers got about 
9 percent of total income, as shown in Figure 17.4. As of 
2014, the top 1 percent of taxpayers were get-
ting 21 percent of all income; that’s a stunning 
increase.
Not surprisingly, this view has itself been 
disputed by other economists, who argue that 
tax return data have all sorts of problems. In 
particular, they do not include Social Security 
payments, which are a large part of income 
for many elderly taxpayers. And tax return 
numbers may be distorted by tax evasion. 
Nevertheless, whether you trust the 80/20 ratio or the tax 
return data, it seems likely that income inequality has 
increased.
Reasons for Rising Inequality
Economists are still not sure what has caused the increase in 
income inequality since the 1970s. However, they have sug-
gested several different reasons, each of which may explain 
part of the increase (see Table 17.2).
First, the introduction of computers into the workplace in 
the 1980s and the 1990s seems to have favored skilled and 
educated workers. Remember that before the early 1980s, 
virtually no one had a personal computer at work. By the 
end of the decade, personal computers were everywhere. 
The new technology eliminated or reduced the need for cer-
tain low-skilled jobs, and it put a premium on the ability to 
understand and use sophisticated equipment. The result was 
an increase in the education premium in the 1980s, as we 
saw in the previous chapter in Figure 16.5. As the pay gap 
between the college-educated and those with less education 
widened, it led to more income inequality.

TABLE 17.2
Possible Reasons for Increasing Inequality
Economists have come up with several different explanations for why the U.S. income distribution gap is widening.
	
Reason	
Explanation
Rapid technological change	
The increased use of information technology favors educated 
workers.
Growth of foreign trade	
Competition from low-wage countries has hurt less skilled workers.
Shift to “superstar” markets	
To a greater degree, the top people in a field do much better 
­financially than everyone else.
Changes in government policy	
The minimum wage has not risen as fast as inflation, while taxes 
have been cut for high-income households.
Another cause for widening inequality, especially in 
­recent years, is foreign trade. This explanation used to be 
controversial among economists, but it has become much 
more widely accepted. Prior to the 1980s, workers with a 
high school education could find well-paying jobs in 
­manufacturing. Many of those jobs have now vanished be-
cause low-cost imports from China and elsewhere have 
reduced the size of the U.S. manufacturing sector. In other 
words, the labor pool effect of globalization has caused 
wages for low-skilled workers to fall (as described in 
Chapter 16). At the same time, highly skilled workers have 
benefited from the market expansion effect of globaliza-
tion, at least until now.
Another cause of widening income inequality is what we 
might call the superstar economy. In many fields—sports, 
entertainment, consulting, academics, 
law—there is a ­widening gap in com-
pensation between the top people and 
the merely competent ones. As the 
economy evolves from local to national 
and even global markets, companies are 
reaching out to the best talent they can 
find. The reason is simple: If you are 
accused of a crime, you want the best 
criminal ­defense attorney if you can afford him or her, rather 
than the 10th best or a competent but average one. If you are 
a big company looking for help with a tough problem, you’d 
rather go to one of the top consulting firms rather than get a 
second stringer. This means that the top people in any field 
end up doing very well.

306	
CH 17 
The Distribution of Income
Finally, government 
­action—or inaction—has 
probably played a role in 
increasing income in-
equality, though it’s hard 
to say just how big this 
role is. For example, some 
economists believe that 
the minimum wage helps 
reduce income inequality 
by boosting the pay of low-income 
workers. However, as discussed in 
the  previous chapter, the minimum 
wage has not kept up with inflation 
over the past 40 years.
Poverty
Another way to assess the distribution of income is to look 
at the poverty rate, which is the percentage of people liv-
ing in households that earn incomes below the poverty line. 
The poverty line is an income level that is supposed to in-
dicate the lowest acceptable living standard in the economy. 
It is adjusted for inflation each year and depends on the 
number of people in the household. In 2014, the poverty 
line for a family of two adults and two children was roughly 
$24,000.
Figure 17.5 shows that over the past 40 years the poverty 
rate has been as low as 11.3 percent in 2000, but has risen 
back over 15 percent after the Great Recession. This reflects 
a combination of the disruption caused by the 
financial crisis and lack of real wage growth for 
many Americans.
However, the official poverty rate does not 
tell the full story of how the people at the bot-
tom of the income distribution are doing. One 
reason is that the government’s calculations of 
the poverty rate exclude noncash benefits such 
as food stamps and health care programs such 
as Medicaid (a noncash benefit is any income 
support that the government provides other than a direct 
check to the recipient).
It’s also important to remember that a household classi-
fied as poor in the United States may have a higher standard 
of living than the typical person in another country. Over 
time, some countries have closed the income gap with the 
United States, but it’s a slow process. (See “How It Works: 
Global Catch-Up.”)
THE DEBATE OVER  
INEQUALITY  LO17-3 
When we consider rising income inequality in the United 
States and what economists, politicians, and the public 
want to do about it, we find enormous and passionate dif-
ferences of opinion. Virtually everyone would agree that a 
rich country like ours cannot allow its citizens to starve, 
no matter how poor they may be. Yet people argue about 
whether the government should act to reduce inequality

and, if so, by how much. We summarize these ideas in 
Table 17.3 (on the next page) and discuss them next.
Two Competing Notions of Fairness
Supporters of government intervention argue that an econ-
omy with wide gaps between rich and poor is inherently un-
fair and immoral. It’s not right, they say, for one person to 
live in a shack and go hungry while someone else lives in a 
mansion. The gaps between vast wealth and poverty in the 
same economy, or even the same city, are morally problem-
atic for many people.
Those in favor of government action use this argument to 
support many different kinds of intervention, including ­using 
the tax system to even out incomes; offering subsidies for 
necessities like housing, food, education, and medical care; 
providing income support for families and children; and re-
training workers for better jobs. These programs all exist to-
day, though not funded to the level that their supporters want.
However, an appeal to fairness can also underpin an argu-
ment against government intervention. Income support 
­programs cost money, which has to come from somewhere—
mainly taxes. Many people believe it is not fair to take 
money away from those who have earned it: “I worked many 
hours to earn my money—why should the government take 
it away and give it to someone else?” Whether or not you 
agree with this argument, it has proven to be politically po-
tent enough over the past 35 years to win support for tax cuts 
at both ­national and local levels.
Inequality, Growth, and Politics
Some supporters of government intervention use a prag-
matic rather than a moral argument. They point out that big 
income gaps cause social stresses and political strife that 
­impede the functioning of the economy. For example, if peo-
ple in the bottom half of the income distribution are doing 
poorly, they are more likely to press for restrictions on for-
eign trade. That’s bad for economic growth.
Moreover, in a global economy in which education is in-
creasingly important, a national economy with many poor 
and unskilled workers is increasingly at a disadvantage. 
Are emerging countries catching up to the industrialized 
countries? Figure 17.6 shows GDP per capita for four 
­important emerging economies compared to the United 
States. If the line on the chart is rising, that means the 
country is catching up with the United States. If it’s falling, 
it’s losing ground.

CH 17 
The Distribution of Income
That’s one reason many corporate executives are concerned 
about poverty and education.
On the other hand, opponents of government intervention 
argue that inequality could actually be good for growth. 
How so? In a market economy, you motivate effort and cre-
ativity by giving bigger rewards to the most successful per-
formers. The economy functions better if people have an 
incentive to try as hard as they can, so a bigger gap between 
winners and losers means a bigger incentive to 
succeed.
This is one of the guiding principles of 
­supply-side economics, discussed in Chapter 11. 
Starting with President Ronald Reagan, a sig-
nificant number of politicians and economists 
have argued that taxing the rich too heavily 
lessens their incentive to work hard because 
they don’t get to keep what they earn. From the 
same perspective, some people believe the fear of unem-
ployment and poverty is important for motivating the poor to 
work rather than stay at home on welfare.
There’s another reason government intervention might 
be a drag on growth. Remember that in Chapter 6 we dis-
cussed rent-seeking behavior, which includes activities, 
such as lobbying, undertaken for the sole purpose of influ-
encing government decisions. The 
more the government intervenes in the 
economy for good purposes such as 
helping the poor, the more tempting it 
is for lobbyists and special interest 
groups to try and get a share of the 
government pie for themselves. This 
can be an enormous burden on the 
economy; it diverts resources and leads 
to bad decisions.
Misleading Statistics
As we saw earlier in this chapter, economists do not agree 
about how much income inequality has risen. Supporters of 
government intervention argue that the official figures put 
out by the Census Bureau understate inequality. In fact, an 
analysis of income distribution based on tax returns—which 
are arguably more complete than the census survey—seems 
to show greater increases in income inequality 
(as shown in Figure 17.4).
On the other hand, the figures may overstate 
inequality because they don’t include noncash 
benefits such as ­Medicare and food stamps. The 
figures also don’t take into account income mo-
bility, which describes the changes in your in-
come level over your lifetime. There may be 
years when you have very low income—when 
you are young, for instance—and times when 
your income is much higher. For example, imagine an econ-
omy in which all young workers earned $20,000 per year, 
and all middle-aged workers earned $100,000 per year. If we 
looked only at the figures for one year, we’d see a big gap 
between the poor and well-off households. But if we tracked 
people’s income through their lifetimes, we’d see that this 
was a highly equal society in which everyone’s income rose 
equally as they matured.

government intervention: the use of the tax system for

transfers money from high-income to low-income households. 
Some amount of redistribution is essential for fixing the in-
equities produced by a market economy and for ensuring that 
poor people have enough money to live.
In theory, a tax system could be an effective mechanism 
for redistributing income. Suppose, for example, we im-
posed a high tax rate—say 90 percent—on anyone earning 
over $100,000. Then the after-tax income distribution—
that is, what’s left after the tax is taken out—would be much 
more equal than the pretax income distribution.
We call the share of total income a household pays in 
taxes the effective tax rate (by contrast, the marginal tax 
rate is the share of the last dollar going for taxes). An in-
come tax is progressive if high-income households pay a 
higher share of their income in taxes than do low-income 
households; that is, high-income households have a higher 
effective tax rate. For example, the federal income tax is 
progressive because the tax rate rises as household in-
come rises. A progressive tax tends to make the after-tax 
income distribution more equal than the pretax income 
distribution.
For example, Table 17.4 shows how a progressive in-
come tax can reduce inequality. Suppose the government 
collects a 10 percent tax on incomes up to $50,000 and 
then a 30 percent tax on everything a household earns 
above that (obviously, this is a simplified version of the 
actual tax system). Then a household with a $20,000 in-
come will pay $2,000 in taxes (10 percent of $20,000). A 
household with a $200,000 income will pay $47,000 in 
taxes (10 percent of the first $50,000 plus 30 percent of the 
remaining $150,000).
In this example, the high-income household pays about 
24 percent of its income in taxes, and the low-income house-
hold pays 10 percent. This difference in tax rates tends to 
narrow income inequality. Before taxes, the high-income 
household has an income 10 times that 
of the low-income household as shown 
in the right column of Table 17.4. 
­After taxes, the ratio falls to 8.5—still 
a big gap, but not as wide as before.
In contrast, a tax is regressive if it 
makes low-income households pay a 
bigger share of their incomes than 
high-income taxpayers. Consider a 
sales tax, for example. A sales tax is 
typically equal to some percentage of 
the money spent on purchases. That is, 
households pay the tax on the portions 
of their incomes that they spend but not 
on the portions saved.
As a result, the sales tax is regres-
sive. Most low-income households 
don’t do much saving, so they pay sales 
tax on almost their entire incomes. 
However, high-income households 
don’t spend all their incomes, so they 
pay a lower share of their incomes in 
tax. That is, if you earned $1 million 
per year but spent only $10,000, you 
could pay the same sales tax as a family 
earning $10,000 and spending $10,000.
Table 17.5 shows a more realistic 
example of a regressive sales tax in ­action. The tax rate is 
6 percent on all purchases, so the low-income household—
which spends everything—ends up paying a sales tax of 
$1,200 (6 percent of $20,000). But the high-income house-
hold, because it spends only half its income, pays $6,000 in 
taxes (6 percent of $100,000). That means the after-tax ra-
tio of high income to low income actually increases from 
10 percent to 10.3 percent because of the sales tax.
TABLE 17.4
An Example of a Progressive Income Tax
In this example, households pay a 10 percent tax on income up to $50,000, and 30 percent on everything over that. As a result, 
households with higher incomes pay a higher effective tax rate.

Adding It All Up
Figuring out whether the whole U.S. tax system is progres-
sive or regressive is not easy because U.S. citizens pay a lot 
of different taxes, including income tax, sales tax, property 
tax, and payroll tax (for Social Security and Medicare). 
Some of these, like the income tax and property tax, are pro-
gressive. Others, like the sales tax and the payroll tax, are 
regressive.
What’s more, there have been multiple recent changes to 
the tax code, including big tax cuts in 1981, 2001, and 2003, 
and big tax increases in 1990, 1993 and 2013. In fact, Wash-
ington has changed the tax law almost every year, in either 
big or small ways. 
Surprisingly, after all these changes, the federal tax 
­system is about as progressive now as it was in 1979. For 
example, those in the top 1 percent income bracket paid 
35  percent of their income in federal taxes in 1979  
(including income taxes, payroll taxes, gasoline and other 
excise taxes, and their share of corporate income taxes). 
That’s ­according to the nonpartisan Congressional ­Budget 
Office. ­After President Reagan cut taxes for high-earning 
households, the effective tax rate for the highest-earning 
1 percent dropped as low as 24.7 percent. Tax increases 
by President Bill Clinton in 1993 pushed the effective 
rate at the top as high as 35 percent, which his successor, 
­President George W. Bush, lowered again. Then President 
Barack Obama pushed it back up again. Thus the effec-
tive tax rate on top-income individuals in 2013, the last 
year for which data are available, was 34 percent (see 
Figure 17.7).
However, it is true that the poor now pay a smaller 
share of their income in federal taxes today than they did

in 1981. The reason is that both Republicans and Demo-
crats have been willing to ease the tax burden on the poor, 
so more and more low-income households pay little or no 
federal income tax. According to the 2015 tax code, a 
married couple with two young dependent children could 
make as much as $40,000 without paying any federal in-
come tax.
The question of redistribution will continue to be impor-
tant in the future. It’s unlikely, though, that we will see gov-
ernment intervention making a dramatic change in the 
distribution of income.
EARNINGS AND LABOR MARKET 
DISCRIMINATION  LO17-5 
Now we turn to another aspect of income inequality: the 
question of discrimination in labor markets. Labor 
­market discrimination occurs when one per-
son is paid less or treated worse on the job 
than an equally qualified person because of 
his or her race, gender, or some other charac-
teristics. One government responsibility is to 
enforce workplace antidiscrimination laws. 
These may differ by city, by state, and by oc-
cupation. On the national level, for example, 
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) 
enforces laws forbidding employment discrimination 
based on age, race, color, religion, 
gender, national origin, or disabled 
status.
Despite such laws, a reality of to-
day’s labor market is that some 
groups—notably women, blacks, and 
Hispanics—consistently earn less on 
average than others. Women earn less 
on average than men, while blacks and 
Hispanics earn less on average than 
whites. Figure 17.8 provides some 
comparative figures for 2015, based on Bureau of Labor 
­Statistics data. For example, the median weekly earnings of 
adult male workers were $895 per week, compared to $726 
for adult female workers (median means the midpoint—half 
the members of a given group earn more than the median, 
and half earn less).
How much of these disparities comes from illegal dis-
crimination, and how much from other sources? 
In addition to discrimination, there are three 
main reasons earnings could differ by gender 
and race: differences in education, differences 
in experience, and differences in occupational 
choices.
Let’s start with education. As we saw earlier 
in the chapter, better-educated workers gener-
ally earn higher pay. Today, women have pretty much the 
same education levels as men, so education differences can’t

explain much of the gender pay gap. As of 2014, 32 percent 
of women 25 years and over were college graduates, almost 
identical to the level for men. And if we look at men and 
women aged 25 to 29, there’s a big difference in favor of 
women: 37 percent of women were college graduates com-
pared to 30 percent of men.
However, education differences can explain part of the 
pay gap for blacks and Hispanics because it is still true today 
that non-Hispanic whites have a higher average level of for-
mal education than do comparable blacks and Hispanics. 
Among 25- to 29-year-olds, only 21.6 percent of blacks and 
15.1 percent of Hispanics had four years or more of college. 
In comparison, 40.8 percent of non-Hispanic whites in that 
age group were college-educated.
If we stopped here, it would look as though differences 
in education go a long way toward explaining why non-
Hispanic whites earn higher wages than do blacks or His-
panics. But the situation is a bit more complicated. Some 
people argue that blacks and Hispanics face unfair obsta-
cles in attending and graduating from college because 
they tend to come from poorer families who have a harder 
time paying for education and because they face discrimi-
nation getting into and attending college. To the extent 
that these two factors are true, a difference in educational 
attainment can itself reflect economic inequality and 
discrimination.
Similar complications come up when we look at differ-
ences in pay between men and women working full-time. 
This pay gap has narrowed substantially over time, but it is 
still there. As Figure 17.9 shows, in 2015 the median 
weekly earnings of full-time female workers were only 
about 81.2 percent of earnings of comparable male 
workers.
Part of this pay gap reflects the tendency of many oc-
cupations to be filled mainly by one gender or the other. 
Occupations that are heavily female tend to be paid less. 
For example, lawyers are evenly split between men and 
women as of 2015, but 85 percent of paralegals, who are 
paid much less, are female. More than 70 percent of den-
tists are male, while 94 percent of dental hygienists are 
female.
To what extent does the gender segregation of occupa-
tions reflect discrimination, and to what extent does it re-
flect choice? Why should most dentists be male and virtually 
all dental hygienists female? Some economists assert that 
women choose lower-paid occupations with more flexible 
hours, such as teaching, rather than better-paid but more 
time-consuming occupations, such as being corporate exec-
utives. Other economists find this reasoning flimsy and ar-
gue that there is still widespread discrimination against 
women in traditional male occupations, which drives women 
away from better-paying jobs.
CONCLUSION
Just by the numbers, there is clearly income inequality in the 
United States. Equally clearly, it has been increasing in re-
cent years, with an increase in the share of income going to 
the top earners. 
Similarly, labor market outcomes continue to reflect 
­differences in pay and occupational choice by gender, and dif-
ferences in pay and educational attainment by race and 
­Hispanic ethnicity. 
However, there is little agreement among economists 
about how to address inequality. Some argue that there is 
little that government can and should do. Others believe that 
taking action to reduce inequality is one of the most impor-
tant responsibilities of government. This question is likely to 
be one of the more controversial ones in economics for many 
years to come.

The Distribution of Income	
313
17
SUMMARY
	 1.	The Census Bureau tracks the nation’s income distri-
bution each year, based on a survey. A quintile rep-
resents 20 percent of all households. The 20th 
percentile is the income level that marks the dividing 
line between the bottom quintile and the second quin-
tile, whereas the income level that marks the dividing 
line between the top quintile and everyone else is 
called the 80th percentile. One way to measure in-
come inequality is the 80/20 ratio, which is the 80th 
percentile of income divided by the 20th percentile of 
income. A high 80/20 ratio means that high-income 
households earn a lot more than low-income house-
holds. (LO17-1)
	 2.	Income inequality in the United States has been in-
creasing over time. However, the size of the increase 
depends on what measure you use. The reasons for 
rising inequality include rapid technological change, 
the growth of foreign trade, a shift to superstar mar-
kets, and changes in government policy. Another way 
to assess inequality is to look at the poverty rate, 
which measures the percentage of the population liv-
ing in households with incomes below the poverty 
line. (LO17-2)
	 3.	Economists disagree about whether more govern-
ment intervention is needed to reduce income in-
equality. These disagreements involve issues of 
fairness, growth, politics, and data problems. (LO17-3)
	 4.	The tax system can be used to redistribute income 
from high-income households to low-income house-
holds, thus reducing inequality. A progressive tax 
like the income tax reduces inequality, whereas re-
gressive taxes like sales or payroll taxes increase 
­inequality. (LO17-4)
	 5.	Another aspect of income inequality is discrimination 
in labor markets. That means one person is paid less 
or treated worse on the job because of his or her race, 
gender, or some other characteristic. (LO17-5)

CH 18 ECONOMICS OF 
RETIREMENT AND 
HEALTH CARE
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After you have read this chapter, you should be

retirement, and identify the main 
sources of retirement funds.

contribution retirement plans.

challenge facing Social Security, and 
describe the possible solutions.

its problems, and the role of health 
insurance.
LO18-5

spending is rising so quickly.
LO18-6	
Identify the goals of the Affordable 
Care Act of 2010, and explain why it 
is controversial.
(mainly Medicare for the elderly and Med-
icaid for the poor).
	
The problem, though, is that this mixed 
public–private system is expensive, and it 
is getting more so as the population ages. 
What’s more, many people believe the 
U.S. health care system does not work 
well and leaves too many people unpro-
tected. That led President Barack Obama 
to sign health care reform legislation (the 
Affordable Care Act, or ACA) in March 
2010. This complicated bill, which we will
T
here are few certainties in life, but 
here are two scenarios that are inevi-
table. First, at some point, you will get sick 
and need the services of a doctor and 
perhaps a hospital. And second, you will 
eventually grow old and be ready to (or be 
forced to) retire.
	
Because these scenarios apply to every-
one, the questions of how to pay for health 
care and retirement are two of today’s 
most important economic issues. 
	
Both require society to take care of peo-
ple who may not be in a position to care for 
themselves. As a result, the normal market 
solution of letting individuals make their 
own decisions doesn’t always work. It is 
not socially acceptable to allow old people 
to live in squalor because they cannot work 
anymore. And it is not socially acceptable 
to let old or poor people suffer or die be-
cause they cannot afford medical care.
	
That’s why the United States has ad-
opted a mixed private–public system to 
provide for both retirement and health 
care. Retirement income comes from 
personal savings, employer retirement 
plans, and government programs (mainly 
Social Security). Health care comes through 
personal spending, employer-provided 
­insurance, and government programs

discuss later in this chapter, has transformed the 
health care sector and led to many more people 
­being covered by health insurance. Yet, there are still 
questions about its effectiveness and strong pres-
sure to substantially change or repeal the ACA.
	
In this chapter, we will look at the economics of 
retirement and health care. We will lay out the basic 
life cycle theory, which explains how retirement 
would work in the absence of Social Security and 
pensions. We will describe how the current retire-
ment and health care systems are financed and why 
they will run into financial problems in the future. 
­Finally, we will discuss health care reform, including 
the ACA as it stands at the end of 2016.
THE BASICS OF RETIREMENT  LO18-1 
Before we examine the current system of retirement, we 
should understand how individuals might finance their spend-
ing in old age by themselves, without any assistance from the 
government or from employer retirement plans. Remember, 
retirement means you no longer have income from work.
The Life Cycle Theory of Retirement
The life cycle theory of retirement describes what could 
happen if there were no government or business-supported 
programs for the elderly. It says people spend when they are 
young, save during the latter part of their working lives, and 
then spend while they are retired. According to this hypoth-
esis, in your early years your income is low, and you need to 
spend money on education and buying 
a home. In your middle and later work-
ing years, your income rises, and you 
have the opportunity to pay off your 
debts, save money, and build your 
wealth. Then, when you 
retire, you spend your nest 
egg.
This life cycle theory is 
illustrated in Figure 18.1. 
The graph shows how 
your net worth—your 
­total assets minus your 
debt—starts out negative 
as you borrow for a home 
and education. Your net 
worth turns positive as your income 
rises, followed by a decline after you 
leave the workforce. Whether your net 
worth actually drops to zero depends 
on how long you live after retirement 
and on how much you spend—and 
whether you want (or are able) to leave 
an inheritance to your heirs. 
Problems with the Life Cycle Theory
In some ways, the life cycle theory seems reasonable as a 
prescription for action. It suggests a strategy for everyone to 
provide for their own retirement without the need for any 
government intervention. All that’s required is the willing-
ness to save for the future.
But at least two things can go wrong with this simple 
­vision. First, poor people are often not in a position to save 
much for retirement. Because their incomes are low, all their 
earnings go for necessities such as food and 
housing. No savings accumulated when work-
ing means no savings available for old age. 
­According to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of 
Consumer ­Finances, only 53 percent of families 
save—that is, have income greater than their 
current spending. Call this the retirement 
­poverty problem.
Second, it’s difficult to know how much 
money to put away in savings to cover all the 
eventualities. For example, the amount of savings 
you need for retirement depends on how long you will live af-
ter retirement. Today, if you are 35 years old, you can expect to 
live another 45 years on average, to 80 years old (slightly less 
for men, slightly more for women). However, there’s an 18 per-
cent chance you will live until 90 if you are male, and a 
30 percent chance if you are female. And even at the current 
state of medical science, there’s a 6 percent chance of reaching 
95 if you are male, and a 12 percent chance if you are female!

Should you save enough to cover 15 years of ­retirement, 
25 years, or even more? No one knows. Call this the retirement 
uncertainty problem.
The length of your life is not the only unknown making it 
difficult to plan the right amount of money to save for retire-
ment. Depending on your assumptions, the amount of money 
you need can vary enormously. Will you or your spouse be 
stricken by an illness that requires expensive treatment and 
leaves you poor? Will the investments into which you put 
your savings do well or poorly? Will inflation be high 
enough to eat away at the value of your savings?
Because running out of money can leave you poor in old 
age, you need to save extra. The need to save extra money 
for retirement should lower your consumption and living 
standards during your working life.
Sources of Retirement Income
The combination of the retirement poverty problem and the 
retirement uncertainty problem means that individual sav-
ings by themselves are not enough to provide for retirement. 
Today, economists talk about the four-legged stool of 
­retirement income: part-time work, employer retirement 
plans, Social Security, and individual savings. Employer 
­retirement plans, which we will discuss in the next section, 
are provisions for retirement that your employer contributes 
to on your behalf. And Social ­Security—
which we will discuss at length later in 
this chapter—is income the government 
provides to older citizens.
Table 18.1 lays out the sources of 
­income in 2014 for U.S. adults aged 65 
and over. Their single largest source of 
support was Social Security, which 
­accounted for 35 percent of their in-
come. The next biggest source was 
earnings from current work, showing 
that many older people are still working 
part-time. Amazingly, income from 
­assets—that is, the result of individual 
savings—­accounted for only 10 percent 
of income for adults 65 and over. That’s 
because most people reach old age 
without much savings.
In fact, if you did want to fund your 
retirement completely out of individual 
savings, you would require a truckload 
of money. The exact amount would 
­depend on what assumptions you made 
about your return on investments and 
how long you would live. (See “How It 
Works: How Much Do You Need to 
Save for Your Own Retirement?”)

Suppose you had to fund your retirement entirely out of 
your own savings—that is, with no Social Security checks 
or payments from employers. How much would you 
need in savings when you retire?
	
The answer to this question is not simple: It depends 
on how much income you want, how long you will live, 
and what kind of risks you want to take with your invest-
ments. Obviously, the longer you live, the more savings 
you need. And if you want to put your money into safe 
investments, you will have to compensate for their low 
average rate of return by saving more.
	
For example, suppose you have saved $500,000 
when you retire at age 67, and you decide that you want 
to take out $40,000 per year, adjusted for inflation. How 
long will that last? If you invest your money in a safe 
money market account, you will get meager interest that 
will barely keep up with inflation. In that case, you will end 
up drawing down your entire savings in 12 years or so. 
	
Alternately, you could put your money into the stock 
market, which historically has returned an average of 
7 percent annually. Then assuming you get the average 
return, your money will last 30 years—but then you 
take the risk that the value of the market might fall  
and take some of your money with it. There are no 
guarantees.

EMPLOYER RETIREMENT  
PLANS  LO18-2 
In some ways, the existence of employer retirement plans is 
a bit of a surprise. After all, why should employers care 
about what happens to their workers after they stop provid-
ing productive labor?
But, in fact, in the late 19th century, employers discovered 
that setting up a retirement plan was a good way of attracting 
and keeping high-quality workers. Today, there are two types 
of employer retirement plans, defined benefit and defined 
contribution. In this section, we will discuss the 
differences between the two and the limitations 
of employer retirement plans in general.
Defined Benefit versus  
Defined Contribution
A defined benefit plan gives you a predeter-
mined amount of money monthly when you re-
tire. The exact amount depends on how much 
you earned during your work life, how long you 
were employed with that company, and the age 
at which you retired. The amount received may or may not be 
adjusted for inflation. This is the classic employer-provided 
pension.
Defined benefit plans are funded primarily by the em-
ployer. In the case of private employers, the money comes 
from pretax profits (that is, the amounts a company contrib-
utes to a pension plan for its employees are not subject to the 
corporate income tax). The company invests the money in 
the stock market and in bonds. If the stock market goes up, 
the employer might be able to provide the pension without 
putting in any money of its own. But even if the investments 
fall short, the employer is responsible for making the prom-
ised future payments.
Defined benefit plans used to be 
common. In 1980, 84 percent of full-
time employees in large and midsized 
private firms were participating in 
­defined benefit plans. In particular, big 
companies such as General Motors and 
IBM almost always had generous 
­defined benefit plans. Many govern-
ment employees today still have good 
defined benefit plans.
In recent years, however, more and 
more private employers have been 
moving to defined contribution plans. 
Such plans require employees—and 
usually employers as well—to put 
money each month into an account, 
which the employer then invests. The 
actual monthly payment to the retired 
worker, however, depends on how the 
investment does over time. As a result, the retirement bene-
fits are not guaranteed.
The most important form of a defined contribution plan 
today is the 401(k) plan, named for the corresponding sec-
tion of the tax law. Generally, in a 401(k) plan, a participant 
will decide how much of his or her pretax income should be 
put into the retirement account (within government-set lim-
its). The employer then matches the contribution, either 
partly or in full. For example, a worker earning $100,000 per 
year might put 5 percent of her pretax salary, or $5,000, into 
her 401(k) account. At the same time, her employer might 
match 3 percent of her pretax salary, or $3,000. The total 
contributions would be 8 percent of her salary, 
or $5,000 from the worker and $3,000 from her 
employer, per year.
Participants in 401(k) plans can generally 
choose whether to invest their funds in the stock 
market (in the United States or abroad), put them 
into interest-paying money market accounts, or 
put them into other kinds of investments. No 
taxes are imposed on those funds as long as they 
stay in the 401(k) account. They are taxed only 
when withdrawn to pay for retirement expenses.
The Limitations of Employer  
Retirement Plans
Employer retirement plans can be useful in raising individu-
als’ retirement income. However, they do not solve the 
­retirement poverty problem. Full-time workers are more 
Many people have access to defined contribution plans 
at work but choose not to participate. For example, 
­according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 37 percent 
of private-sector, low-wage workers have access to a 
defined contribution plan, but only 17 percent partici-
pate in them. There are a variety of reasons. Some 
people don’t have any spare cash to save; some don’t 
think about the future; some don’t realize the company 
contributes to boost their savings; some simply forget 
to file the right forms.
	
To address this problem of nonparticipation, in 2006 
economists pushed for a change in the laws governing 
retirement plans to make it easier for employers to 
­automatically enroll workers in 401(k) plans. Workers 
can still opt not to contribute, but they have to make an 
active choice in that case. The expectation is that this 
will raise participation rates over time.

likely to be in a retirement plan than those who work part-
time. Better-paid workers are more likely to have retirement 
benefits than those who are paid less.
What about the retirement uncertainty problem? If you 
participate in a defined benefit plan, in theory it will pay you 
the same amount monthly as long as you live. That provides 
a certain measure of security. However, defined benefit 
plans have a big downside: they assume the company will be 
able to provide enough money to fund all future benefits. If 
a company goes bankrupt or fails, the money to 
fund the pension plan may not be there.
To avoid the heavy burden of defined benefit 
plans, many companies have been switching to 
defined contribution plans, which transfer the 
risk to individual workers. With a defined con-
tribution plan, you still have to worry about 
how your investments will do and whether you 
will live long enough to exhaust your savings.
SOCIAL SECURITY  LO18-3 
Social Security was introduced as part of the New Deal in 
1932 to help address the retirement poverty problem. It takes 
a different approach to retirement income than either indi-
vidual savings or employer retirement plans. Both of those 
sources of income are based on the idea of saving now and 
building assets for the future.
In contrast, Social Security levies a tax on current work-
ers to pay for the retirement of yesterday’s workers. In other 
words, income is transferred from current workers to cur-
rent retirees. At the same time, there is an implicit commit-
ment that the next generation will do the same when current 
workers retire. Figure 18.2 shows how Social Security mod-
ifies the life cycle model we described earlier in the 
chapter.
In principle, Social Security can solve both the retirement 
poverty problem and the retirement uncertainty problem. 
Because Social Security is funded by current taxes, it can 
offer a decent retirement income to low-income workers 
without requiring them to contribute that much during their 
careers. Indeed, Social Security has made a major contribu-
tion to lowering the poverty rate of older retirees.
Moreover, because Social Security draws on current 
taxes, it can offer people retirement benefits as long as they 
live. That means workers don’t have to save up huge nest 
eggs to account for the possibility of living to age 80, 90, 
or more.
How Social Security Works Today
As we saw earlier in the chapter, Social ­Security 
provides 35 percent of the income of people 
aged 65 and over. Because of its importance to 
the economy, it’s good to know how the pro-
gram works today. First, the Social Security 
Administration, which runs the program, has a 
formula for determining your monthly benefits. 
That formula depends on the average of how 
much you earned during your lifetime, adjusted 
for the rise in average wages over time. The formula is 
­progressive so that low-income workers get back higher 
percentages of their lifetime average incomes than do better-
paid workers. The benefits are also indexed to inflation—so 
as prices rise, the benefits rise to keep pace with them.
Second, there’s a formula for determining how much pay-
roll tax you and your employer pay each year to fund Social 
Security. As of 2016, you pay 6.2 percent of your wages up 
to a $118,500 wage cap, and your employer pays an equal 
amount. The cap is raised each year to account for inflation. 
These taxes are paid into the Social Security trust fund (of-
ficially called the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Dis-
ability Insurance Trust Fund), invested in Treasury bonds, 
and then paid out in benefits to current retirees.
Third, and most important, there’s no real link between 
the taxes you pay and the benefits you receive later in life. 
Congress can raise and lower the benefit formula as it 
likes—and it has done this many times. It can also raise and 
lower the tax rates as it likes—as it has done many times. 
There’s no direct connection between the two, and there 
never has been. Early recipients received far more than they 
put in, whereas many current high-income workers are likely 
to get only a small return on their payroll taxes.
The Demographic Challenge  
Facing Social Security
The concept of Social Security works well when the popula-
tion is expanding. In this scenario, a 
large working population has to support 
a smaller number of elderly people. 
Paying off the previous generation is 
cheaper than saving for yourself.
It also helps if real wages are rising 
over time, as has been true over the past 
FIGURE 18.2

75 years. Then the younger generation 
is better off than the older generation, 
making it easier for them to pay Social 
Security taxes.
But funding Social Security be-
comes more difficult when population 
growth slows. The clearest sign of the 
funding problem comes from the old-
age dependency ratio, which is the 
ratio of the size of the older popula-
tion (65 years and older) to the size of 
the working-age population (ages 20 
through 64). For example, a ratio of 
0.2 means there are five working-age 
people for every older person to sup-
port. The lower the old-age depen-
dency ratio, the less tax burden each 
worker has to support the older 
population.
Figure 18.3 shows the history of the old-age dependency 
ratio, along with the projections of the Social Security 
­Administration through 2075. The ratio goes from 0.2 to 0.4, 
which means instead of 5 workers supporting every retiree 
in 2075, there will be only 2.5 workers. The burden on each 
worker will double.
Will Social Security Run Out of Money?
You’ve probably heard this over and over again: “Social 
­Security is going to run out of money.” That’s partly true, 
but it’s also misleading. For many years, Social Security was 
running a surplus: The amount coming into the trust fund 
from taxes exceeded the amount being paid out in benefits. 
As a result, as of the end of 2015, there was roughly $2.8 tril-
lion in the Social Security trust fund, held in federal govern-
ment bonds (these bonds are promises from the government 
to pay recipients in the future). In effect, the Social Security 
trust fund has lent the rest of the government its surplus.
However, starting around 2016, Social Security is 
­beginning to run a deficit: The amount being paid out in 
benefits to current retirees slightly exceeds the amount 
coming into the Social Security trust fund from taxes. 
From this point on, there will be a financing gap between 
Social ­Security taxes and benefits that will get larger over 
time. To meet the legal obligations to retirees, the Social 
­Security trust fund will start cashing in its assets, which 
are Treasury bonds.  
But here’s the tricky part. The Treasury bonds in the 
trust fund are obligations of the U.S. government. So, when 
the Social Security trust fund starts selling its bonds, the 
purchaser is the rest of the government. That means as 
soon as the Social Security financing gap appears—which

means now—Congress and the president have to come up 
with more money. 
Fixing the Retirement Shortfall
In the short run, the relatively small Social Security financ-
ing gap is just going to be rolled into the broader federal 
deficit. The federal government will raise a bit more money 
by issuing public debt, and then use that money to buy back 
bonds from the Social Security trust fund.
But as the old-age dependency ratio increases and the 
­Social Security financing gap grows larger over time, policy-
makers will have four possible responses: cut Social Security 
benefits, raise payroll taxes, fund the gap from general rev-
enues, or privatize Social Security. Let’s look at the pluses 
and minuses of each of these, and whether and how they 
might be combined.
CUTTING BENEFITS  The most likely response to the 
­financing gap is probably a reduction in Social Security ben-
efits. Over the long run, a 30 percent reduction of benefits 
from their expected levels would bring 
the cost of Social ­Security back in line 
with expected payroll taxes.
However, the cut in benefits need 
not be a reduction in payments across 
the board. It could come in the form of 
SPOTLIGHT: WHY DON’T AMERICANS SAVE MORE?
Social Security is not about to disappear, but its benefits 
are likely to be trimmed in the future. That means 
­Americans should be saving more for retirement. The 
­personal savings rate is equal to personal savings as 
a percentage of disposable personal income, which is 
­income after taxes. Figure 18.4 shows that the personal 
­savings rate dropped from more than 10 percent in the 
early 1980s to a low of 2.6 percent in 2005. It bounced 
back after the ­recession as households spent less, and 
then fell back down again to around 5 percent. 
	
Still, most economists agree that a 5 percent personal 
savings rate is not nearly enough. Why don’t Americans 
save more? One reason is that, historically, U.S. consum-
ers have had access to a lot more credit than consumers 
in other countries; this let them keep buying instead 
of saving. Second, the housing boom in the 2000s in-
creased the value of homes around the country and 
made U.S. homeowners feel wealthier, encouraging 
them to consume beyond their incomes and driving 
down savings. Finally, some countries, such as China,  
do not have an organized system, like Social Security in 
the United States, for providing support for the elderly. 
Therefore, people have to save to provide for their own 
old age.
	
Sooner or later, Americans are going to have to boost 
their personal savings. That may mean buying smaller cars 
and homes or cutting back on personal entertainment 
expenses.

a higher retirement age, for instance. 
That makes sense, given that people are 
living longer. However, a higher retire-
ment age might be hard on workers 
who do physical labor like loading 
trucks or construction, which is tougher 
when you are in your 60s.
Another possibility is a reduction in benefits for high-­
income workers. That would be less harmful because these 
people are expected to have good savings and alternative 
sources of income. But such a targeted reduction in benefits 
would be likely to erode the political support for Social 
­Security because high-income voters would get less from the 
program, making them less likely to support it.
RAISING THE PAYROLL TAX  Another possible response—
either by itself or combined with a benefits reduction—is an 
increase in the amount that Social Security receives from 
payroll taxes. One way to achieve this is to raise the Social 
Security payroll tax rate, which is currently 6.2 percent of 
wages from both workers and employers.
Another way to raise payroll taxes is to lift the 
Social ­Security cap—that is, the maximum 
amount of income that can be taxed. For ­example, 
in 2016 the Social Security cap was $118,500. If 
a worker made $200,000 that year, he or she paid 
Social Security tax on only the first $118,500 
earned. Raising or eliminating the cap on Social 
Security taxes would increase tax revenues.
FUNDING WITH GENERAL REVENUES  It is inevita-
ble that at least a portion of the Social Security gap will 
be funded out of general revenues, which include per-
sonal and corporate income taxes. When the Treasury 
bonds in the ­Social Security trust fund are cashed in, that 
money will come out of the overall federal budget—in the 
form of higher taxes, lower spending, or both. When the 
trust fund has been completely depleted, Congress and 
the president will have the option to use the same flow of 
funds from general revenues—personal and corporate 
­income taxes, ­primarily—to directly support Social 
­Security benefits.
But will there be the political desire and will to do this? It 
probably depends on how well the economy is doing. If 
growth has been strong and real incomes have risen, workers 
may feel able to pay a bit more in taxes to support older citi-
zens. But if growth has been weak, the natural tendency will 
be to force everyone to cut back—which includes cutting 
Social Security benefits.
PRIVATIZATION  The first three responses to the Social 
Security shortfall keep the basic structure of today’s retire-
ment system. Privatization, in contrast, refers to an ­overhaul 
of the Social Security system that takes the radical step of 
moving more of the decisions and responsibility of retirement 
saving into the private sector while preserving a basic safety 
net for the poor and unlucky.
Many versions of privatization have been proposed. The 
most basic version is a defined contribution plan: The money 
from each individual’s payroll taxes would go into a per-
sonal account rather than a national trust fund. Each indi-
vidual would then be responsible for investing the money to 
have enough for retirement.
In this scenario, the government role would be to set rules 
for how much workers would have to contribute and how 
they would be allowed to invest. In addition, the government 
would “top up” the accounts of low-income workers—that 
is, the government would contribute enough money to make 
sure everyone had a minimum amount in his or her account.
The benefit of privatization is that if the economy and the 
stock market were to do well, people might retire with more 
money than they would have gotten through Social Security. 
And because it would be mandatory for people to build up 
their personal accounts, there would be more savings in the 
economy and likely more growth.
The downside of privatization is the retire-
ment uncertainty problem: Workers would once 
again have to worry about whether they will 
have enough money to support themselves 
through old age. If the economy does poorly, 
the returns on personal accounts will be 
lower—and instead of having guaranteed pay-
ments as they do now, retired workers will 
share the pain with current workers. Moreover, 
there’s a large transition problem because work-
ers who are now close to retirement age don’t have an op-
portunity to build up personal accounts to replace the Social 
Security payments they have counted on. This is not an easy 
problem to solve.
In the end, it’s likely that the Social Security shortfall will 
be solved through a combination of all four ­approaches—
some reductions in benefits, increased payroll taxes, some 
reliance on general revenues, and perhaps personal ac-
counts added to the current system. The exact mix, how-
ever, will depend on the next generation of politicians and 
economists.
THE BASICS OF HEALTH CARE 
SPENDING  LO18-4 
We now turn from retirement and Social Security to health 
care, one of the more politically controversial topics. Health 
care today is the largest sector of the economy. In 2014, 
Americans spent $3 trillion on health care, including drugs, 
hospital care, and nursing homes. That’s roughly 17.5 percent 
of the economy, bigger than food or housing.
Health care’s share of the economic pie has been 
­growing, as Figure 18.5 shows. Similarly, health care has 
­accounted for a big share of job growth in recent years (see

ment programs, such 
as Social Security, to

“Spotlight: Health Care and the Job Market”). ­Compared to 
other ­countries, the United States spends far more on health 
care per person. (See Figure 18.6.)
If these trends continue, health care could equal 30 percent 
of the economy by 2075. Imagine a world where every third 
building is a hospital, nursing home, or doctor’s office! As a 
result, the question of how to slow the growth of health care 
spending, while still maintaining or even improving care for 
everyone, is one of the biggest issues facing policymakers.
The Health Care Life Cycle
To understand why health care spending is such an issue, 
let’s start by looking at the basic economics of health care. 
In most markets, decisions to purchase and consume are

­voluntary. You choose when and how 
to buy a new car or a new home. By 
contrast, in the health care market, con-
sumption decisions are usually forced 
by an external event such as getting 
sick. There are three types of health 
events. First, there’s the flow of ordi-
nary health care expenses when you are 
young and middle-aged: dental and vi-
sion costs, occasional visits to the doc-
tor for the flu or sports-related injuries. 
Second, there’s the catastrophic health 
event, which becomes more likely in 
middle age: getting cancer, for exam-
ple. Finally, there’s the inevitability of 
a steady stream of old age–related 
health expenses as you age: heart 
­attacks, strokes, cancer, and expensive 
end-of-life care.
In the absence of government- or 
business-supported health insurance, 
these three stages make up the health 
care life cycle. Let’s consider what the 
health care system would look like if it 
were completely paid for by individuals 
as they used it. The young and middle-
aged would probably pay for their ordi-
nary health care expenses out of their 
own pockets. Both young and middle-
aged people would buy catastrophic 
health insurance, which would cover 
the high expenses incurred for a cata-
strophic health event but not ordinary health care expenses 
(e.g., it would pay for the hospital and physician services for 
a serious accident, but not for an ordinary visit to the ­dentist). 
Middle-aged people would pay more for catastrophic insur-
ance, of course, because the odds of something going seri-
ously wrong are higher in middle age than in youth.
However, it would be very expensive to buy insurance 
to cover old age–related health care expenses. The reason 
is straightforward: Because old age–related health care 
­expenses are nearly inevitable, the insurance company would 
have to charge high premiums to pay all the expected claims. 
At some point, it would not be financially worthwhile for an 
older person to buy medical insurance.
Thus, in a health care life cycle, middle-aged individuals 
would expect to pay their old age health care expenses out of 
their own pockets. That means they would have to sock away 
an enormous amount during middle age to cover most of 
their medical costs (see Figure 18.7).
Problems with the Health Care Life Cycle
The life cycle approach to health care has the advantage of 
treating medical care like any other good or service. People 
buy health care according to their income and desires; doctors, 
hospitals, and drug companies supply health care services and 
goods according to their cost functions; and the price of health 
care is set by the interplay between supply and demand.
However, the life cycle approach to health care has the 
same two problems as the life cycle approach to retirement, 
plus another problem of its own. First, it leaves the poor 
­exposed to medical disasters because they cannot afford to 
pay for insurance; that’s the health care poverty problem. 
Second, it puts people in the position of projecting how 
much money they will need to pay for health care when they 
are old—a difficult task because medical expenses are so high 
and so unpredictable. That’s the health care uncertainty 
problem.

SPOTLIGHT: HEALTH CARE 
AND THE JOB MARKET
Along with rising health care spending come health 
care jobs—lots of them. A growing share of the work-
force is employed as nurses, doctors, medical techni-
cians, home health aides, and all the other occupations 
that provide health care. In 2015, health services—­
including hospitals and doctors’ offices—accounted for 
almost 16 percent of all private-sector jobs. What’s 
more, health care makes up a critical part of job growth. 
From 2000 to 2015, the United States added a total of 
8.6 million private-sector jobs. Out of those, an astound-
ing two-thirds, or 5.7 million, were in health care.
	
Will this trend continue? On the one hand, there will 
be an increased need to take care of an aging popula-
tion, which requires more workers. On the other hand, 
hospitals and other providers are under increased pres-
sure to be more productive, which means reducing the 
number of health care workers. It’s not yet possible to 
tell which force will turn out to be stronger.

Finally, the life cycle approach to health care also suffers from 
the adverse selection problem. Adverse selection is the tendency 
for insurance to be purchased by those who are more likely to 
make claims. In particular, health insurance is more likely to be 
purchased by people who are sick and less likely to be purchased 
by people who need it less—the ones who are 
healthy. Thus, any health insurance plan—­
including the catastrophic insurance plan needed 
by the young and middle-aged—will tend to have 
the sickest people (an “adverse selection” of the 
population) in it. This drives up insurance rates be-
cause the plan must pay a lot more in claims (com-
pared to how much it receives in premiums) than it 
would if everyone, including healthier people, were 
insured and paying premiums.
THE RISING COST OF HEALTH 
CARE  LO18-5 
A crucial fact about today’s economy is that health care spend-
ing per person has consistently risen faster than income per per-
son. In other words, the richer we get, the more we spend on 
doctor’s visits, medical tests, mental health care, cosmetic sur-
gery, and almost every other form of necessary or elective care.
For a few years in the 1990s, health care spending seemed 
under control. But in recent years, costs have jumped again. 
One measure of this increase is the consumer price index for 
medical care, which includes both health care services (doctors 
and hospitals) and health care products (drugs and equip-
ment). Between 1995 and 2015, the price to consumers of 
medical care rose at an average annual rate of 3.6 percent. 
Meanwhile, the price of everything else rose at an annual 
average rate of only 2.2 percent.
Why the big disparity? Economists have explored several 
reasons health care costs are so difficult to control. These 
reasons are summarized in Table 18.2; let’s look at them 
more closely.
Demographic Change
Obviously, older people use more health care 
than younger people do. For example, Table 
18.3 shows that the cost of providing health 
care to the typical person aged 65 and over in 
2010 was $18,424, compared to only $3,828 for 
the typical person aged 18 and under (the latest 
data available as this text is being revised). So, 
as the percentage of the population who are 65 
and older rises, health care spending should inevitably rise.
However, demographic change—the changing distribu-
tion of age groups—is only a partial explanation for rising 
health care costs. Table 18.3 also shows that in each age 
group, health care spending is increasing at roughly the same 
rate. That means health care costs would be rising even if the 
population today consisted of only, say, 19- to 64-year-olds.
Rising Incomes
Many people believe health care is a luxury good, as defined in 
Chapter 3: one whose consumption goes up sharply when in-
comes rise. The argument runs something like this: We have all 
the physical goods we need—food, hous-
ing, transportation, and entertainment. So 
as we get richer, we don’t spend the extra 
money on a fourth car or a fifth television 
set. Instead, we spend it on health care. 
	
This probably explains part of the 
rise in health care costs. In fact, U.S. 
adults seem willing to spend a bit extra 
to be able to quickly see a doctor rather 
than waiting months for an appoint-
ment. And they are willing to pay for 
additional tests just to have some peace 
of mind.

Economics of Retirement and Health Care
Third-Party Payments
Imagine that the store manager at your local supermarket was 
allowed to choose the foods you buy. He or she would make 
up the list, fill your shopping cart, and then bill your insur-
ance company. You’d likely end up eating some tasty but 
­expensive items that you otherwise would not have bought.
Similarly, when it comes to health care, the person making 
decisions is often not the patient but the doctor. Roughly 
89 percent of health care spending is paid for by a third 
party—a health insurance plan, Medicare, or Medicaid. That 
means the normal constraints on purchases are not present. In 
theory, a doctor can order expensive tests and treatments with-
out worrying about whether they are actually worth the money, 
and the patient can agree without worrying about whether she 
will have to pay for them. In fact, if the doctor is worried about 
being sued for malpractice by an unsatisfied patient, ordering 
extra tests for self-­protection becomes a rational decision.
This is different from the usual sort of market we dis-
cussed in earlier chapters. Typically, when we talk about buy-
ers in a market, we assume the buyer is also the ultimate 
consumer of the good or service being purchased. So when 
you buy a car, you’ll pay for extra options like special shiny 
trim only if you think they’re worth 
their cost.
In practice, both private health in-
surers and Medicare closely scrutinize 
doctors’ decisions and refuse to pay for 
care they think is excessive. However, 
many economists believe that if pa-
tients had to pay their own health care 
costs, they would spend more frugally.
Tax Deductions for Employer 
Health Care
By law, employer contributions to 
health care plans do not count as tax-
able income. In other words, if a worker 
receives a dollar in wages, he or she has 
to pay federal, state, and 
local taxes on that money. 
But if the employer spends 
that same dollar on im-
proving the company 
health care plan—say, by 
paying for a broader array 
of benefits for workers—
then no one pays any taxes 
on it.
It’s a general principle that if something is untaxed, you 
receive more of it. In this case, there’s an incentive for work-
ers to receive their compensation as health insurance, which 
is untaxed, rather than as wages, which are taxed. That helps 
explain why health care spending is so high. 
Rapid Technological Change
In recent years, the United States has poured hundreds of 
billions of dollars into medical research. The result has been 
all sorts of new medical technologies, pharmaceuticals, and 
procedures intended to improve health and save lives. One 
example is better cardiac care. From 1999 to 2014, the num-
ber of people dying from coronary heart disease declined 
15 percent, even as the number of older people rose.
But this technological progress has come with a big price 
tag. New drugs can be quite expensive when they are first 
introduced. Advanced equipment like an MRI machine is 
also expensive.
Even some advances that look like they should save 
money actually don’t. Using drugs to treat depression and 
other mental illness is cheaper, on a per-person basis, than 
sending the same person to a well-paid psychologist or 
­psychiatrist. Yet because the use of the drugs allow more 
people to be treated, the total cost to the United States of 
treating mental health problems has risen. 
Bad Medicine
Could it be that we are simply wasting money on unneces-
sary medical procedures? Doctors and hospitals don’t ­always 
know what works and what doesn’t. For example, there’s 
some dispute about whether commonly prescribed medica-
tions such as Lipitor (for reducing cholesterol) have the im-
pact on heart disease that doctors expected. This will continue 
to be an important topic in years to come. (See “Spotlight: 
How Well Does Health Care Work?”)
HEALTH CARE REFORM  LO18-6 
Let us describe the basic outline of the U.S health care 
­system. The elderly are covered by Medicare, a program 
introduced by President Lyndon Johnson in 
1965. Low-income children, their parents, and 
individuals with disabilities are covered, not 
always completely, by Medicaid, which was 
also introduced by President Johnson. Many 
workers are covered through employer health 
insurance plans, while military veterans are 
covered through the VA (Veterans ­Affairs) 
hospitals.

MORE ON IT AS THEIR INCOMES RISE.

This health care system helps solve the health care uncer-
tainty problem because the elderly know they are covered by 
Medicare no matter how long they live. Workers, especially 
at larger companies, typically have access to good health 
care services through their employers’ plans, including doc-
tor visits, hospital care for major accidents or illness, and 
some types of prescription drugs. 
However, until recently, this system 
had many gaps and did not fully solve 
either the health care poverty problem 
or the adverse selection problem. Poor 
families—especially those employed at 
low-wage or part-time jobs at small 
­companies—were often without health 
SPOTLIGHT: HOW WELL DOES HEALTH CARE WORK?
We spend an enormous amount on health care, but here’s 
a key question we rarely ask: Does all that money improve 
our health? With most purchases in a market economy, 
you know whether you received value for the money you 
paid. For example, when you buy a car, you know whether 
or not it runs well.
	
The simplest way to assess the quality of our health 
care system is to look at the change in our life expectancy, 
or expected years of remaining life, based on today’s 
health care system. (Obviously, there is no way to predict 
future medical breakthroughs, so we must ignore them in 
this analysis.) Life expectancy for newborns—the usual 
number cited—has risen a lot because of better care for 
pregnant mothers and young children. In 1900, life expec-
tancy at birth was only 47.3 years. In 2014, the latest year 
available, life expectancy at birth had risen to 78.8 years. 
That’s a big gain.
	
However, we can also look at life expectancy at age 50, 
and that picture is not so rosy. As Figure 18.8 shows, at 
the beginning of the 20th century, a 50-year-old U.S. adult 
could expect to live to 71.3 years. Today, that’s increased 
only up to 81.6 years in 2013.
	
Considering how many billions of dollars have been 
poured into cancer and heart disease research in recent 
years, it’s a bit of surprise that the life expectancy of the 
middle-aged hasn’t increased more.
	
One hypothesis is that we have been taking worse care 
of ourselves—getting less exercise and eating too much—
even as medical science has gotten better. Alternatively, 
inefficiencies in the health care system may prevent the 
delivery of good medical care to many adults. Or surpris-
ingly, medical science may still not have advanced far 
enough to be translated into enough new drugs and treat-
ments to make a difference.

care coverage. Similarly, if you lost your job, it was often 
hard to obtain new health insurance at a reasonable cost. 
Meanwhile, many young Americans were not covered be-
cause health insurance seemed too expensive to be worth-
while. In addition, health care costs were rising much faster 
than costs in the rest of society. 
Affordable Care Act of 2010
The Affordable Care Act, signed by President Barack 
Obama in March 2010, was designed to close most of the 
gaps in the health insurance system. The key features of 
the bill addressed both the health care poverty problem 
and the adverse selection problem. On the one hand, the 
legislation included extensive tax credits and subsidies 
to help low-income households buy health insurance. On 
the other hand, the ACA health reform package  included 
an ­individual mandate: a requirement that almost every-
one has to enroll in a health insurance plan or pay a fine. 
The ACA also required that Americans with preexisting 
medical conditions could not be deprived of health 
insurance. 
The reform package was a compro-
mise. Some wanted a  single-payer  
system, such as the one in the United 
Kingdom, where the government pays 
for all health care through revenues 
raised by taxes. Others objected to gov-
ernment intervention into the private 
sector. For example, there was immense 
opposition to the individual mandate—
the idea that the government could 
force someone to buy health insurance. 
The main effect of the ACA thus far 
has been to sharply decrease the per-
centage of Americans without health 
insurance. The percentage of uninsured 
dropped from just under 16 percent in 
2010 to 9.4 percent in 2015, which is 
exactly what was ­intended by the 
­supporters of the law. Still, as shown in ­Table 18.4, not 
­everyone has health insurance. 
Moreover, the ACA is still highly controversial. As of the 
end of 2016, it seems likely that the Trump Administration 
will try to substantially alter or repeal the ACA. However, 
any replacement for the ACA will still have to deal, one way 
or the other,  with the health care poverty problem and the 
adverse selection problem.

By definition, “insurance” is the payment of regular small 
premiums in exchange for coverage in the case of an ex-
pensive but rare event. The classic case is fire insurance: 
only one of 300 living units has a fire every year, but if 
you do have a fire, it can destroy your whole house. As a 
result, most people pay a regular premium to receive 
compensation if their house should burn partially or fully.
	
On the other hand, you would never buy “food insur-
ance.” There would be no point because you have to 
buy food every week. Moreover, you would be continu-
ally filing claim forms with your “food insurer,” who 
would question whether you really needed that extra 
bag of popcorn.
	
Health insurance combines both these kinds of 
events. It covers rare catastrophic and expensive events, 
as well as the flow of ordinary health care expenses.

The Role of Government in Health Care
Why is health care reform so controversial? In several places 
in this text, we have discussed the debate over the role of 
government in the economy. As we have seen, government 
economic intervention is a plausible and sometimes neces-
sary remedy when private markets fall short. That’s espe-
cially true when we focus on social issues, such as the lack 
of medical care for poor people.
On the other hand, we also saw in Chapter 6 that govern-
ment action is accompanied by several downsides. These 
­include the incentive problem because government managers 
don’t have to worry about making a profit; rent-seeking behav-
ior, which leads companies to divert resources to lobbying pub-
lic officials rather than improving productivity; and the lack of 
flexibility and innovation that can occur because government 
officials may be too cautious about making big changes.
This debate about the role of government in the economy 
is always going on, but it is especially intense in health care. 
­Everyone agrees that something needs to be done because of 
the combination of rising costs and dissatisfaction with the 
current system. Yet economists and policymakers are di-
vided about whether to increase the role of the government 
or reduce it.

care are closely linked, but they are not the same. The Social 
Security financing gap is large but relatively straightforward 
to fix. By contrast, no one yet has a handle on the right way 
to deal with fast-rising health care costs.
The next and final chapter will focus on another issue 
likely to be debated for years: how to handle energy, pollu-
tion, and global warming. We will lay out the dimensions of 
the economic problem and discuss potential policy 
alternatives.

SUMMARY
	 1.	The life cycle theory of retirement says people spend 
when they are young, save during the latter part of 
their working lives, and spend while they are retired. 
Two things can go wrong in the life cycle model. First, 
poor people often cannot save much for retirement. 
Second, it’s difficult to know how much money to put 
away in savings to cover all eventualities. The four 
components of retirement income are part-time work, 
individual savings, employer retirement plans, and 
­Social Security. (LO18-1)
	 2.	Employer retirement plans can be useful in raising 
individuals’ retirement incomes. The two types of 
employer retirement plans are defined benefit plans 
and defined contribution plans. However, they do not 
solve the poverty problem. Meanwhile, defined con-
tribution plans, although increasingly common, do 
not solve the uncertainty problem. (LO18-2)
	 3.	Social Security levies a tax on current workers today 
to pay for the retirement of yesterday’s workers. 
­Currently, Social Security is the single largest source 
of support for U.S. adults aged 65 and over. The con-
cept of Social Security works well when the popula-
tion is expanding, but funding Social Security becomes 
more difficult when population growth slows. That 
means we will likely need some combination of benefit 
cuts, tax increases, funding with general revenues, 
and privatization. (LO18-3)
	 4.	Funding health care poses a bigger challenge than 
Social Security. The health care life cycle raises three 
problems that must be solved: the health care poverty 
problem, the health care uncertainty problem, and the 
adverse selection problem. (LO18-4)
	 5.	Health care expenditures have been rising steadily 
as a share of GDP. The reasons include demographic 
change, rising incomes, third-party payments, tax 
­deductions for employer health care, rapid technolog-
ical progress, and bad medicine. (LO18-5)
	 6.	The U.S. health insurance system includes employer 
health insurance plans, Medicare, Medicaid, and pro-
grams for military veterans. The Affordable Care Act 
of 2010 (ACA) was intended to close the gaps in this 
system. As of late 2016, the ACA remains controver-
sial and may be substantially altered or repealed un-
der the Trump Administration, although any 
replacement will still have to address the health care 
poverty problem and the adverse selection problem.

In this chapter, we examine three key

balance between supply and demand for 
energy in the short run. This is a topic of 
enormous importance, especially since

Second, we will consider the sustain-

this from an economic perspective, asking how we

ferent approaches, including using the market as a

THE BASICS OF ENERGY 
CONSUMPTION AND  
SUPPLY  LO19-1 
Let’s start by looking at the basics of energy 
consumption and supply. Energy is one of the 
most important markets in the economy. ­Every 
family, every business, and every organization 
uses energy, so any changes in the price of 
­energy affect everyone simultaneously.
Energy Consumption
Economic history has been the story of rising energy 
­consumption—energy to power factories, move vehicles, 
heat and cool homes, and so forth. Figure 19.1 shows energy 
usage in the United States over the past 150 years, measured as 
millions of British thermal units per person per year. (A British 
thermal unit, or BTU, is a measure of energy; 1 gallon of 
gasoline is equivalent to 124,000 BTUs.)
Over the past century, energy usage per person has 
roughly tripled. However, the oil price shock of 1973 (men-
tioned several times earlier in this text) marked the end of 
unbridled energy use. Since the Great Recession, energy use 
per person in the United States has dropped. 
Still, the United States today uses more energy per person 
than most other countries. Data from the International Energy 
Agency show that the United States uses about 3.6 times the 
world average (see Figure 19.2). In contrast, Germany, with 
the largest industrialized economy in Europe, 
uses 2.0 times the world average energy per per-
son, or roughly half what the United States uses.
Why is Germany’s energy consumption per 
person so much lower than that of the United 
States? One reason is that, compared to 
­Americans, Germans tend to live in smaller 
homes that cost less to heat and cool. Perhaps 
most important, Germany is a much more com-
pact country than the United States, so less 
travel—which consumes gasoline or jet fuel—is required to 
get from one point to another. The distance between 
­Germany’s two largest cities, Berlin and Hamburg, is only 
160 miles. The two largest U.S. cities, New York and Los 
Angeles, are roughly 2,500 miles apart in contrast.
Developing countries such as China and India, although 
sprawling geographically, use much less energy per person 
than the United States. That’s because they have less indus-
try and are poorer. Over the long run, however, as these 
countries become richer and more heavily industrialized, 
they will almost inevitably use more energy.

Energy Supply: Fossil Fuels
Where does our energy come from? From an economic 
­perspective, this is an important question because different 
fuels have different supply and demand characteristics. The 
most widely used energy source is fossil fuels, which ­include 
coal, crude oil, and natural gas. These are all found under-
ground and have been produced over millions of years by the 
transformation of dead animals and plants. Fossil fuels are 
nonrenewable: There is a limited quantity of them (though 
no one knows how much—see “How It Works: Growing 
­Reserves of Fossil Fuels”).
To use fossil fuels, we must first locate them underground, 
which may be quite difficult. For years, it was necessary to 
hunt in nearly inaccessible areas—such as far offshore—to 
find new oil fields. More recently, companies have been able 
to use new technologies, such hydraulic fracturing (“frack-
ing”) and horizontal drilling, to tap into new sources of oil 
and natural gas. This effort requires vast sums—in 2015, 
ExxonMobil, the world’s largest oil company, spent $31 billion 
on exploration and capital investment.
Once the wells and mines are in place, the marginal cost 
of extraction is the amount of money it takes to get one 
more ton of coal, one more barrel of oil, or one more cubic 
foot of natural gas out of the ground. This can vary greatly. 
In some cases, the coal or oil lies close to the surface, so the 
marginal cost of extraction is low. For more inaccessible 
fields, the marginal cost of extraction may be high.

From our discussion of profit maximization earlier in the 
text, we might think that companies will mine coal or pump 
oil and gas as long as the marginal cost of extraction is less 
than the market price. After all, they make a profit on any-
thing they can sell for less than the marginal cost.
However, when it comes to a nonrenewable resource, 
that’s not quite true. The businesses will take into account 
the fact that the price of the coal, oil, or natural gas may rise 
in the future because there is only a limited amount in the 
ground. This implies that the energy companies may not 
produce as much as they possibly could. They may ratio-
nally want to leave some supply in the ground—even if it 
was profitable to extract today—because they expect the 
­future price to rise. Suppose, for example, the marginal cost 
of extraction is $50 per barrel of oil, and the price of oil to-
day is $55 per barrel. That sounds profitable, but if the com-
pany expects the price to rise to $100 per barrel next year, it 
makes sense to not pump everything today.
When they pump oil or mine coal, the companies will 
probably first want to take it from the oil fields or coal mines 
where the marginal cost of extraction is the lowest. So, we 
extract natural resources from the cheapest places. As those 
are exhausted, we get our energy from more expensive loca-
tions. Eventually, as the marginal cost of extraction rises, we 
shift to other energy sources.
Energy Supply: Renewable and Nuclear
Now we turn our attention to the two other main sources of 
energy: renewable energy and nuclear power. Renewable 
energy includes solar power, wind 
power, hydroelectric power, and the en-
ergy products made from newly grown 
plants and trees. This last category in-
cludes ethanol, a gasoline replacement, 
which can be made either from corn 
(corn ethanol) or from agricultural 
wastes and nonfood plants (cellulosic 
ethanol).
Renewable energy sources such as 
solar power have relatively low variable 
costs—after all, the sun is free, and so 
are wind and rushing water. However, 
they are not yet able to provide power 
for transportation applications, such as 
cars, so they cannot replace gasoline 
and other uses of petroleum. 
Moreover, solar panels have high 
fixed costs. Installing a solar power 
system that supplies most of the elec-
tricity for an average-sized house 
might cost $20,000 in an area with lots 
of sun. This means that solar power is 
not yet economically competitive with 
fossil fuels, though it is likely to be in 
the future.
FOSSIL FUELS
Nonrenewable energy 
sources such as oil and 
natural gas that have 
been produced over 
millions of years by the 
transformation of dead 
animals and plants.
NONRENEWABLE 
ENERGY
Sources of energy like 
fossil fuels that have 
only a limited supply.
MARGINAL COST OF

The amount of money 
that it takes to get one 
more ton of coal, one 
more barrel of oil, or 
one more cubic foot

as wind and solar 
power.

CH 19 
Economics of Energy, the Environment, and Global Climate Change
The final category of energy source 
is ­nuclear power, which uses the con-
tained ­nuclear reaction of uranium or 
some other ­radioactive element to 
power an electric generator. Nuclear 
power, like solar power, is likely to be a 
growing source of energy in the future, in part because nu-
clear power does not emit carbon and does not contribute to 
global climate change. However, the Fukushima nuclear 
­disaster in Japan will make countries much more safety-­
conscious. (See “Spotlight: Energy-­Related Disasters.”) As a 
result, the cost of building and ­operating nuclear power 
plants, already high, is likely to rise.
Distribution of Supply
Since the 1970s, the sources of the world’s energy supply 
have shifted, as Table 19.1 shows. Crude oil has become less 
The internal combustion engines that now dominate the landscape are just 
over a century old. They were invented by Nicholas Otto of Germany in 
1876. But it wasn’t until 1885 that George Daimler, also of Germany, was 
the first person to use a gasoline-powered internal combustion engine to 
drive a vehicle. Daimler went on to found the auto company that now bears 
his name, Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz vehicles.

NUCLEAR POWER
An energy source us-
ing contained nuclear 
reactions to generate 
electricity.
In 2000, the world’s proven reserves of oil were equal 
to about 1 trillion barrels, about the same as they were 
a decade earlier. U.S. oil reserves were shrinking, and 
more and more economists were predicting that oil was 
about to become an increasingly scarce commodity.
	
Fast forward to 2014. Instead of shrinking, the world’s 
proven oil reserves had grown by 63 percent to more 
than 1.6 trillion barrels. Similarly, natural gas reserves 
went from 5.1 quadrillion cubic feet in 2000 to almost 
7 quadrillion cubic feet in 2013, a 35 percent gain.  
	
What happened? Remember from Chapter 9 that the 
production possibility frontier can move out if technol-
ogy improves. That’s exactly what happened here. 
­Petroleum engineers developed new extraction tech-
niques such as hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and hori-
zontal drilling that made it possible to extract oil and 
natural gas from places where no one thought it possi-
ble before.  
	
From the economic perspective, the new boom in  
oil and gas production in the United States had several 
important positive consequences. For one, it helped 
contribute to a sharp drop in the price of oil and petro-
leum products such as gasoline, benefiting American 
consumers. Second, it created a significant number of 
jobs in the oil and gas industry and related industries 
such as transportation. 
	
On the negative side, there is the possibility of 
­environmental damage from the fluids used in fracking. 
One worry is that fracking fluid may be causing earth-
quakes in areas such as Oklahoma and Texas. These 
could have significant economic consequences. For 
now, however, the new technologies are holding down 
the price of fossil fuel.

important as an energy source while, nuclear energy has 
­become more important.
However, in other ways the distribution of energy produc-
tion has been surprisingly stable. In 1973, before the oil 
price shock, fossil fuels made up 87 percent of world energy 
production. As of 2013 that’s fallen only a tad, to 81 percent. 
Renewable energy rose from 12 percent of production in 
1973 only to 14 percent in 2013. In particular, solar, geo-
thermal, and wind power still only make up a small share of 
global energy supply.
The Price of Energy
What do we know about the price of energy? The easiest 
energy commodity to track is gasoline, which touches all of 
us. If the price of gasoline, adjusted for inflation, goes up, 
that means, as we saw in Chapter 8, that gasoline prices are 
rising faster than the overall price level. If the inflation-­
adjusted price of gasoline is falling, that means gasoline 
prices are rising more slowly than the overall price level.
Figure 19.3 shows that between 1961 and the late 1990s 
inflation-adjusted gasoline prices actually fell. True, there 
were several spikes in prices, most notably an enormous one 
in the late 1970s and early 1980s. But even that spike faded 
away relatively quickly. 
SPOTLIGHT: ENERGY-RELATED DISASTERS
Unfortunately, 2010 and 2011 were big years for energy- 
related disasters. On April 20, 2010, the British Petroleum 
(BP) Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico 
and triggered the biggest accidental oil spill in history, a sea-
floor oil gusher that flowed for three months until it could be 
successfully plugged. The spill damaged marine and wildlife 
habitats, hurting the Gulf’s fishing and tourism industries. 
	
On the other side of the globe, and nearly a year later 
(March 11, 2011), the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power 
complex in Japan was wrecked by a mammoth tsunami 
from one of the largest earthquakes on record. The result 
was a partial meltdown of fuel, venting of radioactive gases 
and water, and an evacuation of the surrounding area. The 
combination of tsunami-related damage and high radioac-
tivity means the utility that owns the facility has still not 
been able to get the situation under full control as of 2016.
	
However, neither disaster is likely to derail the global 
need for more energy. After the oil spill, the Obama admin-
istration ordered a six-month moratorium on drilling, and 
BP paid out fines, penalties, and compensation of about 
$54 billion. But companies still continue to drill for oil and 
move it via pipeline and train through the country. 
	
Similarly, countries such as China and India are still 
planning to go ahead with their large-scale programs 
for building nuclear power plants, even though the  
ultimate scope of the Fukushima disaster is not yet clear. 
In addition to the ­direct costs of dismantling the damaged 
plants— which could require more than $15 billion and 
40 years to complete—the people evacuated from the 
nearby regions will need to be compensated. Moreover, 
nuclear plants will need to meet ever-higher and more 
­expensive safety regulations. 
	
Still, it is difficult to see a way of meeting the energy 
needs of fast-growing economies without nuclear power, 
especially as nuclear power does not contribute to global 
climate change.

One reason was that oil companies 
kept finding new oil fields. The second 
reason for the stability of oil prices was 
the very low marginal cost of extraction 
in the Middle East oil fields, where 
most of the world’s reserves are lo-
cated. That low marginal cost put a 
ceiling on all energy prices because oil can be used for pro-
ducing electricity and heating, as well as transportation. 
This was the era when Americans bought lots of fuel-
guzzling cars and sport utility vehicles. Re-
member that consumers react to prices. With 
fossil fuel prices stable and relatively low, it 
makes perfect sense that consumption of fossil 
fuels remained high, and there was little impe-
tus to switch to other forms of energy.
But starting in the late 1990s, the real price 
of gasoline begin to climb. With fits and starts, 
the climb continued ­after the Great Recession. At that point, 
some economists started worrying again that the global de-
mand for oil was growing faster than the supply. There was 
more pressure to go for smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles. 
What happened then? New technologies enabled the 
United States and other countries to boost oil reserves by 
more than 60 percent since 2000. (See again “How It Works: 
Growing Reserves of Fossil Fuels.”) As a result, the price of 
gasoline dropped sharply, as we see in Figure 19.3.  
ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY  LO19-2 
What happens next? We can expect continuing improve-
ments in both renewable and nonrenewable technologies for 
producing energy. For example, the cost of generating 
­electricity from solar power is falling as solar panels become 
cheaper and more efficient. In other words, the supply curve 
for energy is likely to keep shifting to the right. 
At the same time, the rapid growth of China, India, and 
other developing countries suggests that we can expect ris-
ing energy demands worldwide for the foreseeable future. 
So the global demand curve for energy is shifting to the 
right as well. 
Will our supplies of energy be up to the task? The main 
danger is not that we will suddenly run out of energy. In-
stead, the potential problem is a sharp and sud-
den increase in the price of energy sometime in 
the future that raises costs and impairs eco-
nomic growth. 
The Economics of Conservation
As we look at the future of energy, we need to 
consider energy conservation, which is a shift 
in economic activities to reduce the use of energy.
There are three types of energy conservation. First, one 
type of conservation happens automatically because of the 
normal working of the market: When the price of something 
goes up, you use less of it. If the price of gasoline rises, you 
drive less or buy a more fuel-efficient car. More broadly, 
consumers and businesses respond to rising energy prices by 
reducing their consumption of gasoline, electricity, and 
other forms of energy.
Figure 19.4 illustrates this form of conservation in the gas-
oline market. Suppose something happens to shift the gaso-
line supply curve and drive up prices—perhaps the Middle 
East oil fields are becoming depleted faster than ­expected, 
so the marginal cost of extraction rises. This causes the mar-
ket equilibrium to shift from point A to point B. As the ­figure

shows, this represents a movement along the ­demand curve 
for gasoline (remember that the concept of a movement 
along a demand curve was defined in Chapter 3). The price 
of gasoline rises, and the quantity of gasoline supplied and 
bought falls.
The second type of energy conservation does not depend 
on the normal workings of the market. Instead, it is the result 
of direct government intervention to control economic activ-
ity to achieve a desirable goal—the command-and-control 
approach, as we defined it in Chapter 6. One important 
­example of command-and-control conservation is the fuel 
efficiency standard for motor vehicles (also known as the 
CAFE standards, an acronym for corporate average fuel 
economy). Since 1974, automakers selling in the United 
States have been required to meet an average “miles per gal-
lon” target for all the cars they sell. The goal is to ensure that 
U.S. motorists are driving more fuel-efficient cars.
These standards have been steadily increased over the 
years. Under President Barack Obama, a rule finalized in 
2012 would raise average fuel economy for new vehicles to 
54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. This would be a tremendous 
improvement over the average fuel economy of 31.5 miles 
per gallon in 2014. 
Economists have debated the effectiveness and cost of the 
CAFE standards. On the plus side, the standards have en-
couraged automakers to put more money into the develop-
ment of some new technologies for increased fuel efficiency. 
On the minus side, the need to raise fuel efficiency has prob-
ably raised the costs of new vehicles.  
In addition to fuel efficiency standards, the govern-
ment has tried a variety of different methods over the 
years to ­encourage conservation. One 
of the biggest moves was the passage 
of the National Maximum Speed Law 
in 1974, which forced states to reduce 
the maximum speed limit to 55 miles 
per hour. Economists disagree about 
how much fuel that restriction saved; 
in any case, the law was repealed in 
1995.
Figure 19.5 shows how such speed 
limits affect the market for gasoline. 
The law shifted the demand curve to 
the left (unlike Figure 19.4, which was 
a movement along the demand curve). 
The equilibrium shifted from point A to 
point B, and the quantity of gasoline 
supplied and bought fell.
The third type of conservation is also 
the result of government intervention, 
but using a market-based approach. A 
market-based approach changes the 
price signals that consumers and producers face in order to 
move their behavior in the desired direction. However, rather 
than directly telling people what to do, a market-based 
­approach gives them more options.

One example of a market-based approach is raising the 
tax on gasoline. This discourages the use of gasoline by 
most drivers, but it allows people who really need to drive to 
get the fuel they need. Figure 19.6 illustrates the impact of a 
gasoline tax. Remember from Chapter 6 that a tax on a good 
or service generally lowers the quantity demanded and sup-
plied in a market.
A market-based approach to energy conservation can also 
use carrots rather than sticks. That is, instead of taxing energy 
consumption, the government can offer tax credits for such 
actions as putting up energy-efficient buildings or improving 
the energy efficiency of existing homes. In 2008, for example, 
the New Jersey state government offered $20 rebates to peo-
ple who bought energy-efficient air conditioners.
Let’s finish up this section by asking a simple question: 
Why does the government need to do anything about 
­encouraging conservation? Why not just let higher prices 
and the normal workings of the market do the work of bring-
ing down energy consumption?
There are several reasons the government might want to 
intervene in energy usage. First, individuals sometimes 
put too little weight on the future. So, the price of oil or 
other forms of energy today may take insufficient account 
of the fact that there is a limited supply of oil in the 
ground. In that case, government intervention corrects for 
short-sightedness.
Second, government-led conservation measures can help 
accelerate the development of new energy technologies. For 
example, a tax on gasoline encourages car companies and 
other businesses to research alternatives to gasoline-powered 
internal combustion engines. By making existing energy 
sources more expensive, the government is sending a signal 
that it’s worthwhile to take the risk of pursuing innovative 
activities in the energy area.
Third, energy usage of fossil fuels typically generates 
pollution, greenhouse gases, and other negative externali-
ties (which were defined in Chapter 6). The measures used 
to encourage conservation also have the side benefit of re-
ducing negative externalities, as we will see a bit later in 
this chapter.
Alternatives to Fossil Fuels
If prices of oil and petroleum products such as gasoline were 
to continue to rise, would there be any good alternative fuel 
sources? The short answer is “yes, sort of.” As Table 19.2 
shows, each alternative source of energy available today, 
while improving, has some key disadvantages, which ex-
plains why oil is still the most significant source of energy 
for the global economy.
However, when we look at the list of alternatives in 
­Table 19.2, we also need to consider the role of techno-
logical change, which we discussed at length in Chap-
ter 15. History tells us that technological change is both 
important and unpredictable. Over the long run, the solu-
tion to rising energy prices is likely to include technologi-
cal breakthroughs that make one or more of the alternatives 
in Table 19.2 more compelling—or perhaps make it possi-
ble to commercialize an energy source that is not even in 
the table. Remember: In 1900, a list of serious competitors 
to trains would not have included airplanes, which had not 
yet been invented.
For example, scientists have known for decades how to 
produce ethanol from wood and agricultural waste products.

This is known as cellulosic ethanol (as distinct from corn 
ethanol, which comes from a food plant). However, the process 
is still too expensive and not economically viable. Many 
businesses are doing research in this area, and a break-
through could make cellulosic ethanol a much more attrac-
tive substitute for gasoline.
ECONOMICS OF THE 
ENVIRONMENT  LO19-3 
Now let’s turn our attention from the economics of energy to 
economics of the environment. In this section, we consider 
the negative impact of pollution, an unwanted side effect of 
economic activity.
Sources of Pollution Externalities
The key concept in environmental economics is externalities. 
A negative externality is a negative side effect from an 
­exchange that affects someone other 
than the buyer and seller. For example, 
a loud car causes noise externalities for 
the people who live in the neighbor-
hood of the driver. A sewage treatment 
SPOTLIGHT: SHOULD THE 
UNITED STATES HAVE A 
HIGHER GASOLINE TAX?
Compared to other industrialized countries, the United 
States imposes very low taxes on gasoline. The com-
bination of state, federal, and local gas taxes came to 
an average of 48 cents per gallon in April 2016. The 
average gasoline tax for all developed countries is 
$2.60 per ­gallon, with many countries as high as $3 to 
$4 per gallon.
	
Many economists believe the United States should 
boost its gas tax to at least $1.00 per gallon. That would 
encourage energy conservation, as well as reducing the 
pollutants and greenhouse gases created by gasoline 
combustion. However, the political opposition to an in-
crease in the gas tax is enormous, especially in large 
states whose residents drive long distances. What’s 
more, a gas tax would be regressive because gasoline 
is a bigger portion of the budget of low-income families.

sites sometimes leave behind contaminated land.
The Impact of Pollution 
Externalities
Economists have identified many negative 
­impacts from pollution. First, health impacts 
include loss of life and reduction of health 
caused by externalities. For example, air pollution increases 
asthma and bronchitis—killing people and causing them to 
miss work and be admitted to hospitals.
A second negative impact from pollution is material and 
crop damage, which represents the harm to buildings and to 
agriculture from pollution. If you see grime and soot cover-
ing a city building, that’s material damage.
Next is the harm to environmental amenities, which in-
cludes negative effects of pollution on natural resources that 
people enjoy. Examples include untreated sewage ruining an 
unspoiled beach and noise disturbing a quiet residential 
neighborhood. (See “Spotlight: Wind Turbine Pollution.”)
Finally, pollution can cause ecological damage, which is 
damage done to the functioning of an ecosystem, including 
harm to plants and animals. An obvious example of ecologi-
cal damage is an oil spill that kills thousands of fish and 
birds. But any kind of pollution can hurt an ecosystem.

plant causes odor exter-
nalities for ­people nearby.
One important source 
of pollution externalities 
is the production and use 
of energy. For example, a 
plant burning coal to gen-
erate electricity produces 
externalities in the form of 
various air pollutants such as sulfur 
­dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. These 
pollutants help produce urban smog 
and acid rain, which damages forests. 
Vehicles burning gasoline also produce 
those pollutants, plus carbon monoxide 
and a variety of other problematic com-
pounds. And virtually any process us-
ing fossil fuels produces greenhouse 
gases, such as carbon dioxide, which 
contribute to global climate change.
However, there are other sources of 
pollution beyond energy-related ones. 
For example, manufacturing residues 
and chemicals create water pollution 
when they are dumped into rivers or 
onto the ground, from which they seep 
SPOTLIGHT: WIND TURBINE POLLUTION
Wind turbines would seem to be the perfect energy 
source for the 21st century. Apparently nonpolluting and 
with no by-products, they use a completely renewable 
­resource—the wind—that no one else wants.
	
Yet many people find that wind turbines cause a kind of 
externality: visual pollution. Across the country, people and 
communities have opposed the construction of wind tur-
bines for power. The reason is simple. Today’s power-­
generating wind turbines are typically more than 400 feet 
high, or as tall as a 30-story building. Put 10, 20, or 50 of 
them on top of a hill to catch the winds, and they can be 
seen for miles. In other words, they harm environmental 
amenities.
	
The best-known fight against wind turbines occurred 
in Massachusetts, where one developer proposed in 
2001 to put 130 wind turbines into Nantucket Sound, 
off the coast of Massachusetts. The local and summer 
residents of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket fought 
the project, called “Cape Wind,” for years. They cited a 
variety of reasons, including potential danger to naviga-
tion and to the local ecosystem. People also complained 
about the spoiled views. As one website opposing the 
project put it:
Occupying 25 square miles, an area the size of Manhattan, the 
Cape Wind project would be highly visible both day and night 
from Cape Cod and from the islands of Nantucket and Martha’s 
Vineyard. The plant would dramatically alter the natural land-
scape and negatively impact several historic landmarks
	
As of June 2016, the opposition meant that the project 
had not yet started construction, 15 years after the initial 
proposal.

Measuring the Damage Done  
by Pollution Externalities
We’d like to be able to translate the costs of pollution externali-
ties into monetary terms. That would make it easier to figure 
out which aspects of pollution do the most damage, helping us 
choose environmental policies with the biggest benefits.
Let’s start with the health impacts of pollution. To put a 
monetary value on these negative externalities, regulators 
and economists use what they call the value of a statistical 
life. This odd phrase describes a monetary value we treat as 
the cost of an additional death from pollution. It is not what 
a person would pay to avoid dying. Rather, it represents the 
value that we as a society put on having one person not die 
from pollution.
To estimate this number, the two main techniques that 
economists use are known as revealed preference and stated 
preference. Revealed preference is an approach that ana-
lyzes the choices people make in their daily lives to change 
their risk of death or injury. For example, if we look at pat-
terns of job choice, how much of a lower salary are they will-
ing to accept to take a job with a somewhat smaller chance of 
death or injury? How much are consumers willing to pay for 
a new automobile safety feature that slightly reduces the 
chance of dying in an accident? By analyzing consumption 
and labor market behavior, economists can calculate how 
much value people put on avoiding death or injury.
The other technique is stated preference, which involves 
surveying individuals and asking how much they would pay 
to reduce their risk of death. One way is to simply ask them 
how much they would pay to reduce their chances of dying 
by 1 percent over the next five years.
But economists have found it’s hard for people to answer 
that question directly. Instead, stated preferences surveys 
usually set up a comparison between two situations and ask 
people to choose between them. For example, a question 
might go something like this:
Suppose you have a choice between two jobs at 
companies A and B. The jobs are identical except for 
one fact: At company A you will be exposed to a 
chemical that has a 1 in 100 chance of causing a 
­fatal illness over the next five years. The job at 
­company A pays $100,000 a year, and the job 
at company B pays $50,000 a year. Which one do 
you choose?
This is not an easy question to answer—but it gives some 
insight to your trade-off between money and the odds of 
dying.
The combination of revealed preference and stated prefer-
ence gives a range of numbers for the value of a statistical 
life, but as of 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) was using a figure of $9.7 million.
We can use similar techniques of revealed and stated pref-
erences to judge the value of environmental amenities. For 
example, suppose that the breathtaking scenic views from 
the top of a mountain are being reduced 
by pollution, and we want to know the 
monetary value of the damages. One 
possibility is that we can look at re-
cords of home sales to see how much 
extra people are willing to pay for a 
home on that mountaintop versus one 
in a valley. This revealed preference 
helps estimate the value of a mountain-
top view. Alternatively, we can survey 
people, asking how much they would 
pay to preserve the views.
The ecological damage done by 
pollution is usually addressed through 
stated preference methods because no 
one really has a direct monetary stake 
in ecology. For example, the Hawaiian 
hoary bat—found only in Hawaii—is 
on the endangered species list (www.
fws.gov/Endangered/species). Suppose 
someone asked you how much you 
would be willing to pay to preserve its 
habitat. You might say 5 cents; but if we 
multiply that 5 cents by the 300 million 
people in the United States, the ­total 
amount people would be willing to pay 
to help the hoary bat is $15 million 
($0.05 × 300 million).
Finally, the monetary value of mate-
rial and crop damage from pollution 
can usually be calculated directly. The loss of crops, for 
­example, is simply what those crops would have brought on 
the open market. The damage to buildings is valued at what 
it would cost to repair them.
Taking these factors together, we can add the various 
costs of the externalities generated by a particular type of 
pollution to get a total cost figure. This figure may have a 
wide range, but as we will see in the next section, it is help-
ful in thinking about economic policy.
Costs in a Market with Externalities
In a typical market, a cost function sums up all the expenses 
of production borne by the seller. The marginal cost curve 
tells us the additional costs of producing one more unit. So 
the marginal cost of a cell phone, say, is the additional cost 
to the phone maker of producing that phone.
However, the cost function for a business omits the exter-
nalities of production—that is, the costs imposed on people 
other than the seller. In particular, it does not include the 
negative externalities produced by the business, such as air, 
water, or noise pollution.
The fact that the cost function is missing the externalities 
makes a big difference. Let’s think about the airlines that use 
an airport in a town. Each airline has a cost function, which 
depends on labor (pilots, flight attendants, mechanics),

­capital (airplanes, primarily), and jet fuel. The more flights 
into the town, the higher the costs. If the air travel market 
into this town is competitive, then each airline adds capacity 
until the price of a ticket is equal to the marginal cost of an 
extra passenger. This is the principle for profit maximization 
in a competitive market, as described in Chapter 5.
But notice what is not in the cost function: the extra noise 
pollution that hits the residents of the town because of the 
additional flights. One more daily 11 p.m. arrival, for ex-
ample, can cause sleepless nights for thousands of people—
but the airlines don’t have that in their cost function. 
Let’s assume, using revealed and stated preference, that 
we’ve done all the calculations and surveys necessary to cal-
culate the monetary value of the noise externality. For the 
sake of argument, let’s say the noise externality caused by an 
extra flight is valued at $500. If we assume that the typical 
plane has 50 passengers and it flies completely full, then the 
extra marginal cost per passenger is $10.
If the airline was actually forced to pay the 
negative externality—that is, pay an extra $10 
for each passenger—that would affect its deci-
sion about how many planes to fly into the town. 
It might be more reluctant to add capacity, and 
the price of the tickets would have to be higher.
Let’s show this graphically in Figure 19.7. In 
a competitive market, the airlines will add seats 
up to the point where the price of a ticket equals the mar-
ginal cost of another passenger (leaving out the noise exter-
nality). That’s point A on the diagram.
Now let’s suppose the price stayed the same, but the air-
line had to pay the $10 noise externality as well. Then the 
marginal cost curve would shift upward because the cost 
would be $10 higher for each passenger. The result would be 
that the airline would want to fly fewer planes to the town. 
That’s point B on the diagram.
This example is an oversimplification, of course. If the 
supply of flights into a town falls, that’s likely to lead to 
higher ticket prices and a lower number of people who want 
to fly.
But despite the oversimplification, the basic intuition of 
this example is straightforward: In general, if sellers have to 
take into account the negative externalities produced by their 
good or service, then they probably will choose a lower level 
of output.
CONTROLLING POLLUTION  LO19-4 
How do we get polluters to change their behavior to take 
­account of the negative externalities that they generate? In the 
airline example, we made the assumption that the airlines had 
to pay for the negative noise externalities that they generated. 
But in the real world, it’s not as easy as that.
Imagine, for example, a small town of peo-
ple who live around a lake. They dump their 
wastewater in the lake, which ends up being se-
verely polluted. The members of the town 
council vote and decide that these discharges 
into the lake need to be substantially reduced. 
How should they accomplish this change?
The most straightforward way is to issue regulations 
­restricting how much waste each family or business can dis-
charge into the lake and establishing fines or jail sentences 
for the violators. That’s how most pollution control is done 
today. However, as we will see in this section, economists 
have come up with alternative ways of controlling pollution 
that may produce better results.

Command-and-Control Approaches
As we saw in the section about energy conservation earlier 
in this chapter, the government can use a command-and-
control approach to reduce pollution. That means the gov-
ernment tells businesses and consumers what to do and what 
not to do. Here are a couple of examples. In 1972, the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency banned the pesticide DDT be-
cause of concern about the harm it caused to the environment 
and both human and animal health. Similarly, in 1973, the 
EPA issued regulations forcing refineries to sharply reduce 
the amount of lead they put in gasoline to make car engines 
run better. Studies had shown that the lead from gasoline 
ended up in the air and on outdoor and indoor surfaces, and 
this lead was especially poisonous to children.
Overall, command-and-control regulations have helped 
reduce pollution in the United States and other developed 
countries. Figure 19.8, for example, shows the emissions of 
carbon monoxide, a toxic gas produced by internal com-
bustion engines. The Clean Air Act, passed in 1970 by 
­Congress, required that emissions of carbon monoxide be 
sharply ­curtailed. In response, the EPA issued strict regula-
tions ­detailing how much carbon monoxide cars could pro-
duce. The result: Automakers installed catalytic converters 
in cars, which turn carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide. 
The amount of emitted carbon monoxide fell by two-thirds 
from 1970 to 2014, despite a large increase in the number 
of vehicles.
The benefit of the command-and-control approach is that 
you know what you’re going to get as a result—in this case, 
less pollution. You can simply ban the offensive actions or 
substances or require the use of a particular antipollution 
technology. Command and control can be appropriate for 
pollutants that have large and immediate negative health 
­effects because stopping their use is clearly the best strategy 
for safeguarding the public.
However, command-and-control approaches have a big 
disadvantage: They’re inflexible and usually force all pol-
lution emitters to meet the same standards or install the 
same equipment. That can be expensive and perhaps coun-
terproductive, especially if the regulations take effect very 
quickly.
One of the goals of economic policymakers is to in-
crease economic growth, which is the increase in real 
gross domestic product (GDP). But there’s a problem—
the official government calculation of GDP includes the 
output of factories, power plants, and refineries, but it 
does not subtract the environmental damage done by 
the pollution they produce. That means policy decisions 
may be distorted.
	
To get a more accurate accounting of the costs and 
benefits of growth, some economists have tried to cal-
culate what is called green GDP. Green GDP counts the 
production of the country as a positive but subtracts 
damages to the environment. Such negatives include 
depletion of natural resources and harm to forests, 
­water resources, and other parts of the environment.
	
Measuring green GDP turns out to be a difficult task 
because economists can’t agree on what should be 
counted on the environmental side. Suppose, for exam-
ple, that the amount of forested land increases, as it has 
in the United States since 1987. Should that be counted 
as a positive for GDP? That’s a hard question to answer. 
Nevertheless, green GDP is an important concept.

For example, let’s go back to the 
problem of noise pollution at airports. 
Suppose that the federal government 
made a rule that all airlines could no 
longer use older, noisier planes, in or-
der to address noise complaints from 
people living near airports. What 
would happen then? Suddenly, United 
States airlines would have to ground 
most of their fleet (because they all 
tend to have aircraft that average over 
10 years old). The result: bankrupt air-
lines and sharply higher ticket prices 
for passengers. That’s not a good idea 
at all.
Market-Based Approaches
As we saw for energy conservation, market-based approaches 
to controlling pollution work by changing the price signals 
that people and businesses face in the market. Such price 
signals give people and businesses incentives to produce less 
pollution while giving them more options than the 
­command-and-control approach.
One example of using a market approach to reduce the 
amount of pollution is to tax the product or process causing 
the externality. The government can use that tax to make 
sure buyers and sellers take into account the externalities of 
their actions affecting third parties.
Let’s see how this might work, using your computer as 
an example. Computers and monitors contain sizable 
amounts of toxic metals, such as lead, cad-
mium, and mercury. A typical computer moni-
tor, for instance, can contain several pounds of 
lead, which can seriously damage children’s 
brains if inhaled or ingested. When it’s time to 
dispose of the computer, if it is simply thrown 
in a landfill, these toxic metals are released—
harming human health and the environment.
Now suppose a tax is put on the computer 
according to the amount of toxic metals it con-
tains. The more lead, cadmium, and other toxins in the com-
puter, the higher the tax is. Faced with these incentives, 
computer manufacturers will look for ways to reduce the 
amounts of toxic metals. In other words, the tax forces the 
computer manufacturers to bear part of the externality.
In the air travel example, a similar solution for reducing 
the externality from noise would be to make the airlines pay 
a tax for each landing and takeoff. The exact amount of the 
tax would depend on the noisiness of the aircraft. Extremely 
noisy planes would pay a steep tax, while quiet planes would 
pay no tax at all. The result would be an extra encourage-
ment for airlines to upgrade their fleets to quieter models.
Another market-based approach for reducing pollution is 
the use of tradable pollution permits. A pollution permit 
gives a business the right to emit a particular amount of 
­pollution. For example, since 1995, electric utilities in the 
United States have needed pollution permits (also called 
­allowances) to emit sulfur dioxide, the pollutant that causes 
acid rain.
The idea of issuing permits to pollute may seem like a 
funny concept. But they can be highly effective in reducing 
pollution. First, only a certain number of permits are issued, 
which provides a cap on the amount of pollution (that’s why 
such programs are often called cap-and-trade systems). 
The cap can be reduced over time.
More important, these permits can be bought or sold. If a 
business has a permit to emit some amount of pollution, it 
has three choices. It can use the permit itself. It can decrease 
its own pollution and sell the permit to another business that 
needs it more. Or it can buy more permits if reducing its 
own pollution is too expensive.
The ability to sell permits for a profit gives firms an in-
centive to cut their own emissions more than required. In 
other words, there is a reward for virtue. And the permits are 
sold to companies that have the hardest time cutting their 
pollutants.
GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE  LO19-5 
Now we will focus on one particular environmental prob-
lem: the growing amount of greenhouse gases, such as car-
bon dioxide, in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases arise 
primarily from the combustion of carbon-based fossil fuels, 
such as coal, oil, and natural gas. The current scientific con-
sensus is that the buildup of greenhouse gases 
will significantly warm the earth over the next 
several decades, and that the warming has al-
ready started. Moreover, there seems to be 
agreement that global climate change will lead 
to a significant rise in sea level in the coming 
years. 
This is an economics textbook, so we will 
not address here the science of climate change. 
There is still enormous disagreement about the 
exact timing and degree of global climate 
change, and these facts will be debated for years to come. 
However, assuming global climate change is happening, it 
will have significant economic impacts. We can look at 
­potential policies to adapt to global climate change and to 
mitigate its effects.
The Potential Costs of Global  
Climate Change
Let’s start by quickly reviewing some of the potential eco-
nomic costs of global climate change. First, the effects of 
global climate change on agriculture could be far-reaching. 
Higher carbon dioxide speeds the growth of some crops, 
TRADABLE POLLUTION 
PERMITS
A government-­
endorsed “allowance” 
that gives a business 
the right to emit a par-
ticular amount of pol-
lution. These permits

businesses.

while higher temperatures would change where certain crops 
could be grown. Crucially important would be the change in 
rainfall patterns. Certain food-growing regions could be 
turned into dust bowls, while other areas might become 
more productive.
Second, higher temperatures could decrease the livabil-
ity of areas of the world that already have high average 
temperatures, while making currently cold areas more 
comfortable. Some researchers believe that global climate 
change will increase the likelihood of extreme weather 
events such as droughts and hurricanes, leading to the 
possibility of economically devastating natural disasters. 
And higher temperature will likely cause expansion of 
ocean waters and melting of the Greenland and Antarctica 
ice sheets, leading to rising sea levels that could threaten 
many of the world’s largest cities, including New York 
and London.
Still, one of the greatest uncertainties connected with 
global climate change is identifying which parts of the world 
would be hurt the worst and which parts might possibly be 
better off. This uncertainty makes it much harder to get 
countries to work together: It’s harder to help the people 
who are going to be hurt if we don’t know who they are 
ahead of time.
Policy Response: Adaptation
What can we do about global climate change? The responses 
fall into two broad categories: adaptation and mitigation. 
Adaptation is the alteration of consumer and business 
­behavior to reduce the damage from global climate change. 
Mitigation includes policies to significantly reduce emis-
sions of greenhouse gases. We’ll look at adaption in this sec-
tion and mitigation in the next section.
In some ways, adaptation is similar to the usual demand 
response to a price change. Remember from the law of de-
mand that as the price increases, the quantity demanded 
goes down. For example, if there is a drought in the coffee-
growing regions of Colombia and the price of a cup of cof-
fee goes up, you adapt by consuming less.
On a much larger scale, adaptation to global climate 
change represents the same sort of response. Suppose the 
rise in temperatures shifts the main wheat-growing region 
of the United States northward. Gradually, farmers will 
change the crops that they plant to take account of the new 
temperature and rainfall patterns. Similarly, a rise in the 
sea level will cause people to adapt, either by moving fur-
ther back from the coast, by building dikes or dams to hold 
back the water, or altering construction of large office and 
residential buildings to be water-resistant on the lower 
floors.
Adaptation is a useful strategy for a rich country like 
the United States, which can afford to rebuild homes and 
farms to take account of changing climate. But it is much 
more difficult for poorer countries, which do not have the 
resources to adapt. In particular, small island countries 
that are barely above sea level now could see most of their 
land disappear.  
Moreover, even within the United States, the costs of ad-
aptation fall very unevenly. Suppose you own a small home 
right along the New Jersey coast, or on North Carolina’s 
Outer Banks. Then, a sustained rise in sea levels will make 
your home uninhabitable and unsellable. 
The question, then, is whether the government should 
help the adaptation process in this case, perhaps by buying 
out homes. More generally, is there a role for government 
in speeding adaptation to global climate change by help-
ing resettle people? In the extreme, could we imagine 
moving large numbers of people from 
tropical countries—which may become 
­unbearable—to the now-comfortable 
temperatures of northern Canada and 
northern Russia? A difficult question, 
for sure—but one that could conceiv-
ably make economic sense.
Policy Response: Mitigation
If adaptation by itself is not enough, the 
question becomes how best to mitigate 
the harm caused by climate change. 
Can any of the policies we’ve suggested 
to control pollution work to slow the 
activities that contribute to global 
ADAPTATION

sumer and business 
behavior to a change

global climate change.
MITIGATION
The implementation of 
policies and programs 
designed to signifi-
cantly reduce emis-
sions of greenhouse 
gases.
SPOTLIGHT: CAN ISLAND 
COUNTRIES ADAPT TO 
RISING SEA LEVELS?
The U.S. coastal communities would be hurt by rising 
sea levels, but many island countries would lose sig-
nificant portions of their land. For example, a sea rise 
of 1 meter (roughly 3 feet) would inundate many of the 
tourist resorts on The Bahamas. The Pacific Ocean 
­nation of Kiribati, made of more than 30 small low 
­islands, is worried that rising sea levels will reduce the 
amount of their land that can be inhabited or used for 
agriculture.
	
How can these small islands adapt? One solution: 
move. In 2012, the Kiribati government purchased 
6,000 acres in Fiji, about 2,000 miles away, as a 
backup plan for either farming or for migration. Of 
course, Fiji, ­itself composed of many islands of varying 
sizes, may find itself under pressure from rising sea 
levels as well.

­climate change? The command-and-­
control approach is too ponderous a so-
lution for a goal as broad as controlling 
the emission of greenhouse gases. The 
government would have to regulate 
­every use of fossil fuel. The resulting 
degree of control might harm the economy and would likely 
stifle much innovation.
Instead, the preferred approach for mitigating global cli-
mate change is the effective use of price signals. The prior-
ity is to effectively slow the emission of greenhouse gases 
while doing the minimum possible damage to the economy. 
That means giving people and businesses maximum incen-
tives to research and adopt new technologies. Let’s compare 
two widely discussed solutions: a carbon tax and tradable 
permits.
One proposed means for reducing the incentive to burn 
fossil fuels is a carbon tax, which would vary for different 
fuels according to their carbon content. Fossil fuels such 
as coal would bear the heaviest taxes because such fuels 
have a high carbon content, which means they emit the 
most greenhouse gases when they burn. Fuels with a lower 
carbon content, such as natural gas, would be taxed at a 
lower rate.
Over the long run, a carbon tax would encourage less use 
of high-carbon fuels and more use of low-carbon fuels. It 
would also make fossil fuels more expensive across the 
board, thus reducing their consumption.
As a result, consumers and businesses would find it 
worthwhile to invest in energy efficiency. For example, it 
would become much more cost efficient to improve the insu-
lation in a house to retain heat rather than to use more fuel. 
The carbon tax would also encourage the development and 
use of alternative technologies, such as solar power, by 
boosting demand for them as the cost of fossil fuels rose.
There are problems related to the carbon tax, however. 
The first is that it’s a tax, and no one likes taxes. Worse, it 
would be a regressive tax because poor families devote a 
larger share of their income to energy than do high-income 
families. That’s why some economists propose using the 
proceeds from a carbon tax to reduce other taxes that hit the 
poor especially hard.
The other proposed alternative is to use a system of trad-
able pollution permits discussed earlier in the chapter. In the 
context of greenhouse gases, this is usually called a cap-
and-trade system. Already in effect in Europe, a cap-and-
trade system has the government issue a limited number of 
tradable permits for greenhouse gas emissions. The number 
of permits sets the total cap on emissions.
Then, each company has a choice in what it does with its 
permits. It can use its permits. It can buy more permits from 
other companies if it exceeds its carbon emission allowance. 
Or it can sell its permits if it’s managed to reduce its 
emissions.
The buying and selling of permits allows companies to 
make extra money by reducing greenhouse gas emission 
­further than required. In effect, it offers an incentive to be 
environmentally sound.
An International Problem
Probably the toughest part of creating a good mitigation strat-
egy is that it’s an international problem. As Figure 19.9 shows, 
the top countries, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, are a

mixture of developing countries such as China, India, Brazil, 
and Indonesia and developed countries such as the United 
States, Japan, and Germany. 
In theory, either a carbon tax or a tradable permit sys-
tem should work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But 
it’s not clear yet which one will be more politically accept-
able or workable in the United States. Nor is it clear yet 
whether fast-growing developing countries such as China 
and India will be willing to restrict their greenhouse gas 
emissions.
CONCLUSION
This chapter has discussed some of today’s most important 
economic issues: energy, environment, and global climate 
change. With these topics likely to be at the top of the news 
for the next several years, economics is going to play a cru-
cial role in the energy and environment debate.
We’ve come to the end of the text, but not the end of eco-
nomic topics. New problems and questions are going to 
arise, and you now have the tools to understand them.

SUMMARY
	 1.	Energy consumption per person has been flat in the 
United States since the mid-1970s. Nevertheless, on 
a per-person basis, the United States still uses 
3.6 times the world average. About 81 percent of the 
world’s energy comes from fossil fuels, which are non-
renewable. Crude oil is still the single largest energy 
source. The quantities supplied of crude oil and other 
nonrenewable energy sources depend on the market 
price, the marginal cost of extraction, and the amount 
thought to remain in the ground. Other energy sources 
include nuclear power, hydropower, and solar power. 
(LO19-1)
	 2.	There are three types of energy conservation. First, 
the normal response is to reduce the quantity de-
manded of energy when its price goes up. This is a 
move along the demand curve. The second type is 
command-and-control, which represents direct gov-
ernment intervention to reduce the use of energy. The 
third type is a market-based approach, which uses 
price signals to change the incentives of consumers 
and businesses. (LO19-2)
	 3.	Pollution produces negative externalities, which affect 
someone other than the buyer or the seller in a market. 
Pollution externalities can lead to health impacts, mate-
rial and crop damage, harm to environmental ameni-
ties, and ecological damage. The monetary value of the 
damages done by pollution externalities can be esti-
mated using revealed or stated preferences. (LO19-3)
	 4.	Pollution can be reduced by either the command-and-
control approach or the market-based approach. One 
example of a market-based approach is a tax on pollu-
tion. Another example is the use of tradable pollution 
permits. (LO19-4)
	 5.	Global climate change, because of the buildup of 
greenhouse gases, is a critical environmental and 
economic issue. Possible policy responses include 
adaptation and mitigation. (LO19-5)

d)	 All other things being equal, how would the quantity of air travel change? 
	 2.	In 2016, the Department of Energy (DOE) projected that the price of electricity, adjusted for inflation, 
would remain roughly flat for the next 25 years. Meanwhile, the price of gasoline, adjusted for infla-

a)	 If the DOE is right, is that likely to increase or decrease the demand for electric cars? 
	
b)	 The DOE projected that the amount of energy generated from renewable resources such as solar 
power would rise almost 90 percent over the next 25 years, in part because fossil fuels such as oil 
and natural gas are expected to get more expensive. Suppose, instead, that new drilling 
techniques mean the price of fossil fuels unexpectedly falls over the next 25 years. What would 
happen to future use of renewable resources under these circumstances?  
	 3.	It is common to use the tax system to help support new energy technologies. As of 2016, for exam-
ple, the federal government was offering a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of electric and 
plug-in hybrid vehicles (gas–electric combinations that use less gasoline than conventional internal 
combustion engines). (LO19-2)
	
a)	 What effect does the tax credit have on the number of electric and hybrid vehicles sold?
	
b)	 Does the tax credit raise or lower the price charged by sellers of electric and hybrid vehicles?

a)	 visual pollution.
	
b)	 negative health effects.
	
c)	 ecological damage.
	
d)	 crop damage.
	 5.	The patrons at a local bar get rowdy on Friday and Saturday nights and wake up the 10 residents of 
the adjacent apartment building. The town economist surveyed the residents and found that each  
of the residents would be willing to pay $15 per night, on average, to not be woken. (LO19-3)
	
a)	 Calculate the size of the negative externality per night. 
	
b)	 Calculate the size of the negative externality over the course of the year (assuming 50 weeks).
	 6.	Suppose a town has lots of noisy restaurants that disturb their neighbors. The citizens would like to 
reduce the noise level without driving all of the restaurants away. (LO19-4)
	
a)	 Suppose the town issues fines for exceeding noise limits. This is an example of the _____ 
approach to pollution control. 
	
b)	 Alternatively, the town decides to issue tradable “noise permits” that allow restaurants to make a 
certain amount of noise each night. This is an example of the _____ approach to pollution control.
	
c)	 Suppose there are six restaurants making the same amount of noise each night, but the town 
would like to get the number down to three. Is the fine-based or the tradable permit approach 
likely to work better?
	
d)	 If the town succeeds in reducing the number of noisy restaurants, is the price of a meal likely to 
rise or fall?

this rule?
