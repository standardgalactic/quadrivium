Preface 
 
 
This book is based on material assembled for courses, short courses, and seminars 
on microwave tubes that I have given over 100 times at various U.S. Navy, Air 
Force, Army, and NASA facilities, Varian Associates (now CPI), Hughes (now 
L3) Electron Dynamics Division, Teledyne Electronic Technologies, Litton (now 
L3) Industries, L3 Defense Systems Division, Texas Instruments, the French 
Ministry of Defense, the University of California at Los Angeles, The University 
at Buffalo, and other locations. There have been over 2,000 students with 
backgrounds ranging from third-class Navy electronic technicians through 
microwave tube experts to individuals at the chief scientist level. 
 
This book contains a balance of practical and theoretical material so that those 
new to microwave tubes as well as experienced microwave tube technicians, 
engineers, and managers can benefit from its use. To a large extent, each chapter 
builds on material from earlier chapters and so, for the newcomers, it is advisable 
to work through the book starting at the beginning. For those who have 
microwave tube experience, most of the chapters can be used without referring to 
others. For those who are interested in further study and research, the references to 
the works of over 500 authors dating from the invention of the microwave tube to 
the present time should be of value. 
 
Contributions to this book have come from many sources. First of all, Thomas 
Bekker of the Port Hueneme Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center 
provided the encouragement that led me to give my first 5-day course on 
microwave tubes in 1982 and to publish the book Microwave Tubes in 1986. 
Then, with the encouragement and support of Eugene (Joe) Dutkowski of the 
Crane Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, I developed an 8-day course 
on traveling wave tubes that led to the publication in 1994 of Principles of 
Traveling Wave Tubes. Subsequently, I developed 8- and 10-day courses, which 
contained in-depth material on klystrons and crossed-field devices as well as 
traveling wave tubes. Recently, I was asked to prepare lecture material on fast 
wave devices. In this book, I have integrated the new material on klystrons, 
crossed-field devices, and fast wave devices with revised material from my 
previous two books.  
 
Especially valuable technical contributions have come from the following:

who made substantial recommendations and contributions to the course material 
and to my books.

Introduction 
 
 
Microwave tubes are vacuum electron devices used for the generation and 
amplification of radio frequencies in the microwave frequency range. Microwave 
frequencies are generally considered to be from somewhat less than 1 GHz to over 
100 GHz. The millimeter-wave frequency region is part of the microwave range 
and is generally considered to extend from about 30 GHz to 300 GHz. 
 
 
1.1   THE MICROWAVE SPECTRUM 
 
The microwave spectrum is divided into several frequency bands. The two most 
commonly used band designations are shown in Figure 1-1. The old band 
designation was established during World War II. The new designation, 
established to provide a more logical system, has not been widely accepted. The 
old band system is most commonly used in the microwave tube industry and is the 
one used in this book.

1.2   THE DOMAIN OF MICROWAVE TUBES 
 
Before the advent of solid-state devices, microwave tubes were the only active 
devices available for use at all power levels throughout the entire microwave 
range. Now, as indicated in Figure 1-2, vacuum devices (microwave tubes) 
predominate in high-power, high-frequency applications and solid-state devices 
are used mostly at relatively low powers and frequencies.

There is no clear dividing line between the domains of tubes and solid state 
because several factors (see [1] for a relevant discussion) beside average power 
and frequency must be considered in most applications. Some of these factors are: 
 
 
1. In general, microwave tubes are far more efficient than solid-state 
devices. With the use of the appropriate collector technology, tube 
efficiencies can approach or, in some cases, exceed 70%. 
 
2. Microwave tubes can operate at much higher temperatures than solid-
state devices. This, coupled with higher efficiency, means that tubes can 
be smaller and lighter than solid-state devices and still eliminate waste 
heat. 
 
3. Because of their extremely high reliability, traveling wave tubes are the 
amplifiers of choice for many satellite applications. 
 
4. A factor of great importance in many applications is the large bandwidth 
for some microwave tubes. This can be over 2 octaves for some helix-
type traveling wave tubes (TWTs). 

Introduction

So we see that even though there is an overlap in capabilities on a power versus 
frequency chart, tubes may be selected to obtain the required system capability. 
 
 
1.3   CLASSICAL MICROWAVE TUBE TYPES 
 
Most microwave tubes were invented prior to World War II [2â4]. Two types, the 
magnetron and the reflex klystron, were the subjects of intense development 
efforts during the war for use in radar. During and after the war, numerous other 
microwave tube types and configurations were invented. Most did not find 
application for any of several reasons (low efficiency, low gain, complexity). 
Today, five types of microwave tubes predominate. Four are conventional devices 
and the fifth is the gyrotron. These are the subjects of this book: 
 
 
1. Klystrons; 
 
2. Traveling wave tubes; 
 
3. Magnetrons; 
 
4. Crossed-field amplifiers; 
 
5. Gyrotrons (gyro-monotrons and gyro-amplifiers). 
 
 
These can be divided into the three categories, linear-beam, crossed-field, and 
fast-wave tubes, shown in Figure 1-3. The reasons for this division become clear 
when the configurations of the tubes and the electric and magnetic fields in them 
are considered.

Figures 1-4 and 1-5 show the basic configurations of klystrons and traveling 
wave tubes. In each case, after being formed in an electron gun, the electron beam 
travels linearly through the RF circuit to a collector. In the klystron, the RF circuit 
consists of resonant cavities. There is no electromagnetic coupling between 
cavities. The RF input signal accelerates and decelerates electrons in the beam. As 
the beam drifts, faster electrons catch up with slower electrons and this results in

the formation of bunches of electrons and an RF current in the beam that grows as 
the beam moves along. This current is coupled first to intermediate cavities (only 
one is shown) and then to the output cavity. At each intermediate cavity, the RF 
beam current induces a signal, which, in turn, produces a field that enhances the 
bunching process in the beam. Finally, the coupling of the intense RF beam 
current to the output cavity produces the RF output power of the device. The gain 
of a klystron can be very large, 60 dB or more, but the bandwidth is usually 
limited to a few percent to about 10%. Output power levels can be tens of 
megawatts or more.

In the traveling wave tube (TWT) the RF circuit is continuous so that a signal 
can travel along the circuit much like it does on a transmission line. The circuit is 
designed so that the velocity of the signal is nearly the same as the velocity of the 
electron beam passing through it. Also, the circuit is designed so that the electric 
fields from a signal on the circuit penetrate into the beam as indicated in Figure 
1-5. These fields accelerate some electrons and decelerate others so that bunches 

Introduction 
 
5 
of electrons are formed. As these bunches pass by the nearby circuit, they induce 
an RF current flow in the circuit and this causes the amplitude of the RF field on 
the circuit to increase. The increased field, in turn, increases the bunching action in 
the beam. As a result, as the bunches in the beam and the field on the circuit travel 
along (at the same velocity), the bunching action in the beam increases. As the 
bunching becomes more intense, the RF current in the beam and the field on the 
circuit become larger. Eventually, the amplified signal is coupled off from the 
circuit. The resulting gain of a TWT is usually in the 30â50-dB range and the 
bandwidth can be from 20% to over 2 octaves. Output power levels range from 
tens of watts for extremely broadband devices to hundreds of kilowatts to 
megawatts for narrowband devices. 
 
The basic configurations of magnetrons and crossed-field amplifiers are 
shown in Figures 1-6 and 1-7. In these devices, the cathode is a cylindrical emitter 
in the center. In general, electron flow is radially outward towards the RF circuit, 
which also serves as the anode. Because a magnetic field is used, which is 
perpendicular to the cathode-to-anode electric field and to the direction of electron 
flow, electrons are forced to move in paths that circle about the cathode. When an 
RF field is present, the electrons are bunched into spoke-like configurations.

The magnetron is an oscillator in which the RF circuit consists of resonant 
cavities. The cavities are arranged so that the RF magnetic field generated in each 
cavity is coupled to adjacent cavities. As a result, ideally the entire cavity structure 
resonates at a single frequency with the RF electric field in adjacent cavities being 
180Â° out of phase. As the RF field oscillates, the field pattern across cavity gaps 
rotates about the cathode. If an electron spoke circles about the cathode in 
synchronism with the rotating field pattern on the anode, then the spoke can arrive

at each gap at a time when it will induce a current in the cavity that reinforces the 
oscillation. The resulting power out of the magnetron can be in the multimegawatt 
range and efficiencies reported to be as high as 88% are possible. 
 
The operation of a crossed-field amplifier (CFA) (Figure 1-7) is similar to that 
of a traveling wave tube. The RF circuit is designed so that a signal can travel 
along it in synchronism with electrons that are moving next to it. In the TWT, 
electron bunches are formed that move along with the traveling wave. In a CFA, 
electron spokes are formed and these circle about the cathode in synchronism with 
the wave traveling on the circuit. The electric fields from the circuit wave enhance 
the bunching action in the spokes and the currents induced in the circuit by the 
spokes enhance the electric fields. As a result, the wave on the circuit grows as it 
travels from input to output. In some CFAs, the circuit is designed so that a 
backward wave interaction can occur and produce amplification. The gain of 
CFAs is usually less than 20 dB, but power outputs of tens of megawatts are 
possible.

In fast-wave devices, the beam-wave interaction mechanism is completely 
different than in linear beam and crossed-field devices. As Figure 1-8 indicates, in 
linear beam and crossed-field devices, the frequency of operation is determined by 
the RF circuit and so circuit dimensions scale with wavelength. As frequency is 
increased, power capability is decreased. In gyro-devices, the frequency of 
operation is determined by the cyclotron frequency and by the magnetic field. 
Frequency is independent of circuit dimensions, so very high powers can be 
generated at very high frequencies.  
 
As Figure 1-9 indicates, the electron beam in gyro devices is hollow.

From the preceding discussions, it is apparent that the basic operating 
principles of all microwave tubes are the same. An electron beam is passed 
through the tube with a circuit containing an electromagnetic field. The electron 
beam and the field interact to produce amplification or oscillation. 
 
Hidden in this simplistic description are some clues to the extremely complex 
nature of a microwave tube. For example, the fact that an electron beam is used 
makes it necessary to evacuate the interior of a microwave tube to a pressure that 
may be over 11 orders of magnitude below atmospheric pressure. To achieve and 
maintain this pressure over the life of a tube, it is necessary to use special 
materials and fabrication techniques.

As another example, because of the high electron density required in the 
electron beam, the source of the electrons and the beam in most microwave tubes 
are very sophisticated structures. As we look further into the operation of a 
microwave tube, it is found that nearly every aspect of construction and operation 
is extremely complex. 
 
1.4   OVERVIEW OF THIS BOOK 
 
In selecting the subject matter for this book, a serious attempt has been made to 
include discussions of all the technologies that are essential to an understanding of 
microwave tube operation. The order of presentation of the material has been 
selected so that the reader, in working through the book from the beginning, can 
develop, in a logical sequence, a working knowledge of microwave tubes. 
 
After a review of electron dynamics, cathodes and electrodes for forming 
electrons into linear beams are discussed. Next, the behavior of the beam after 
being subjected to a localized RF electric field is analyzed. This leads to 
discussions of the operation of klystrons followed by the analysis of the interaction 
of the beam with a traveling RF electric field. Perhaps the most significant result 
of this analysis is the importance of the relative velocities of the traveling RF field 
and the electron beam to the amplification of the RF field. This leads directly to a 
general discussion and analysis of the variation of velocity with RF frequency 
(dispersion) of TWT circuits. With an understanding of the significance of 
dispersion characteristics, it is possible to analyze in some detail helix TWTs and 
then coupled-cavity TWTs. 
 
Many modern klystrons and TWTs use sophisticated electron beam collectors. 
These enhance the efficiency but do not directly affect the interaction of the beam 
with the circuit. Because of the importance of this subject, all of Chapter 16 is 
devoted to collector technology. 
 
The operation of crossed-field devices is still not as well understood as that of 
linear-beam tubes, even though the magnetron was developed before linear-beam 
tubes were. Still, an attempt is made in Chapters 18, 19, and 20 to describe the 
most important aspects of the operation of these devices. The crossed-field device 
cathodes and the secondary emission process used in the cathodes of crossed-field 
tubes are discussed in some detail and then magnetrons and crossed-field 
amplifiers are described. 
 
The gyrotron, which was invented in 1964 in Russia, is relatively new to the 
microwave tube field (klystrons and magnetrons were invented in the 1930s and 
the TWT was invented in 1940). There are many configurations for gyrotrons 
(gyro-oscillators, gyro-klystrons, gyro-twystrons, gyro-TWTs), and these and their 
applications are described. 
 
The remainder of this book is devoted to subjects not related directly to the 
electromagnetic interactions that occur in microwave tubes but that, nevertheless, 
are important to the understanding of the total operation of a tube. For example, all

microwave tubes use output windows that permit the RF power generated within 
the tube to be used outside the tube. Noise, nonlinearities, and distortion are 
important in most applications of tubes. When tubes fail, it sometimes results from 
degradation of the vacuum environment in the tube, and so a discussion of vacuum 
requirements is included.  
 
A degradation in vacuum environment along with many other factors can lead 
to electrical breakdown in a tube, and so breakdown phenomena along with 
requirements for protecting tubes against the effects of breakdown are discussed.

Static Fields Produced by Electrons 
 
 
2.1   ELECTRIC FIELD 
 
At many points in the analysis of electron motion in microwave tubes, it is 
necessary to include the effects of the static electric fields produced by the 
electrons. Those effects can be very large as the examples in this chapter 
demonstrate. Before examining two of those effects in electron guns, it is 
enlightening to look at the example in Figure 2-1. The effect of 106 electrons on 
the potential distribution in a small sphere is shown. With the shell of the sphere 
grounded (at zero potential), each electron that is placed within the sphere causes 
the potential at the center of the sphere to decrease a little over 1 Î¼V. With 106 
electrons, the potential at the center decreases to â1.44V. The density of electrons 
in the electron beam in a microwave tube is two to three orders of magnitude 
above that indicated here, so potential depressions produced by electrons are 
normally hundreds to thousands of volts.

It was pointed out by one of the authorâs professors many years ago that, in 
nearly all of the operations that must be carried out in designing, fabricating, 
testing, and manufacturing a microwave tube, âMother Nature is there to trip you 
up.â In the case of electron emission from the cathode of an electron gun in a TWT 
or klystron (Region 1 in Figure 2-2), it turns out that Mother Nature (and the very 
dense cloud of electrons near the cathode surface) is there to help us. In Chapter 5, 
this phenomenon is discussed in detail. Here we indicate why the electron cloud 
near the cathode is so important. 
Cathode
Region 1

Electron Beam
 
Figure 2-2   Region 1 near the cathode in an electron gun will be used first to illustrate the 
effect of the field produced by electrons on microwave tube operation.  
 
 
In Figure 2-3, the potential near the cathode surface is shown. When no 
electrons are present, the increase in potential with distance from the cathode is 
nearly linear. (Itâs not quite linear because of the configuration of the electrodes. 
With a cathode and an anode that are parallel planes, the variation would be 
linear.) 
 
When the cathode is heated so that a small current flows (this is called 
thermionic emission), each electron causes a slight depression in the potential. As 
the temperature of the cathode is increased, more current flows and the potential is 
depressed further. Eventually, when temperature is increased far enough, the 
density of electrons near the cathode surface becomes so high that the potential 
near the cathode surface decreases to zero. It is not possible to increase the current 
further by increasing temperature because the additional electrons would tend to 
cause the potential near the cathode to become negative. However, if the potential 
becomes negative, the additional electrons would be repelled and returned to the

cathode surface. Thus, it turns out that emission is self-limiting and it is the 
potential depression produced by the emitted electrons that produces the limiting 
action. Operation of a cathode in this self-limiting mode is called space charge 
limited operation. 
 
When emission is space charge limited, then cathode temperature, surface 
condition, and so forth have no effect on emission. This is indeed a very fortunate 
situation because it eliminates the necessity for extreme uniformity of temperature 
across the surface of a cathode. It also eliminates the necessity for precise control 
of the voltage and current to the heater in the cathode. This is why it can be said 
that, in this case, Mother Nature has been on our side.

In the electron gun shown again in Figure 2-4, another region (Region 3) is 
identified where the electric field produced by electrons plays a critical role in gun 
operation. The electrodes in an electron gun are designed so that, after electrons 
leave the cathode, they move toward the center of curvature of the cathode. As 
they enter the anode aperture, they pass through a region (Region 2, which is not 
shown here but is discussed in Chapter 3) where the action of the electric fields is 
analogous to that of an optical lens. The focal point of the electron flow is shifted 
from the center of curvature of the cathode to a point farther from the cathode. 
 
Then, as the electrons pass through the anode, they enter Region 3 where they 
escape from the accelerating electric fields between the cathode and anode and the 
only forces affecting their trajectories are the forces between electrons. As the 
electrons move closer together, the increasing forces between electrons cause their 
trajectories to become nearly parallel in the center of Region 3. It is at this point 
that, to counteract the electron forces that cause the beam to expand, focusing 
forces must be applied to the beam if it is to be transported through the RF 
interaction structure of a klystron or TWT. Electron beam focusing and transport 
are discussed in Chapter 7.

The potential depression in the beam that accompanies the forces causing the 
beam to stop contracting and then to expand is dependent on the charge density in 
the beam. Also, as explained with the aid of Figures 2-5 and 2-6, the depression is 
dependent on the proximity of the beam to the metallic cylinder (tunnel) through 
which the beam is passing. 
 
To find the potential in the beam, Gaussâs law can be used. This law relates 
the electric field on a surface surrounding charged particles like electrons to the 
magnitude of the charge, Q, contained within that surface. Gaussâs law is

These depressions are significant for at least two reasons. First, the electron 
beam is traveling more slowly than the beam voltage would indicate. For example, 
the electrons in the center of the 100,000-V beam with a 3,441-V depression have 
been accelerated through 96,559V rather than 100,000V. 
 
The depression is also significant because positive ions, which can interfere 
with normal tube operation, can become trapped in the beam.  
 
2.2   MAGNETIC FIELD 
 
The electron beam in a microwave tube produces a magnetic field, but this field is 
small and is often neglected. The calculation of the field is straightforward. In any 
circular path concentric with the beam, the magnetic field is constant. At the outer 
edge of a beam with radius b and current I, the magnitude of the field is

Electron Motion in Static Electric Fields 
 
 
In the electron guns and in some collectors of TWTs and klystrons, dc voltages are 
applied to accelerate or decelerate electrons. The ways in which those fields 
influence electron trajectories are described in this chapter. Included is a 
discussion of the relativistic velocity correction, which is important in very high-
power devices.  
 
The very simple case of electron deflection by transverse fields in a cathode 
ray tube is followed by an examination of electron motion in electric lenses. The 
focusing relation derived here will be of use in the analysis of electron guns.  
 
Finally, the influence of the electric fields produced by the electrons on the 
electron trajectories in an axisymmetric configuration is examined. This will also 
be of use in the analysis of electron guns as well as in explanations of electron 
beam behavior. 
 
 
3.1   MOTION PARALLEL TO FIELD

3.2   RELATIVISTIC VELOCITY CORRECTIONS 
 
The relation (3-4), showing that electron velocity is proportional to the square root 
of voltage, is valid only when velocities are low compared with the velocity of 
light. This is because the mass was assumed to be constant, whereas, by the theory 
of relativity, the mass of a particle changes with velocity. Also, from the theory of 
relativity, mass and energy are equivalent and are related by the square of the 
velocity of light, c 2; that is, the energy, w, is related to mass by

w  mc

If a force, F, is applied over a distance, dz, to accelerate an electron, then the

The relation between electron velocity and voltage can now be found by 
reconsidering the energy expended, c2 dm, in accelerating the electron over 
distance dz (see (3-8)). If the accelerating force is supplied by an electric field, E, 
then the energy supplied by that field is âeEdx or edV where dV is the voltage 
increment through which the electron was accelerated. The energy supplied must 
equal the increase in electron energy so

3.3   ELECTRIC LENSES 
 
In this section, the influence of an electric lens on electron trajectories is 
examined. The electron gun used in Chapter 2 and shown again here in Figure 3-2 
will be of use in explaining one of the reasons why we want to understand the 
effects of electric lenses.  
 
As electrons enter the anode aperture, they pass through Region 2 where the 
action of the electric fields is analogous to that of an optical lens. The focal point 
of the electron flow is shifted from the center of curvature of the cathode to a point 
farther from the cathode. To understand why this happens, it is very useful to 
examine the âequipotentialâ surfaces near the anode in the electron gun. 
 
In Figure 3-2, the anode voltage is 10 kV above the cathode voltage. An 
equipotential surface at a potential of 5 kV is identified. If a voltage probe could 
be used that did not disturb the potential surfaces, and voltages were measured, 
this is the surface on which the 5-kV measurements would be plotted. Thus, an 
equipotential surface is an imaginary surface on which the potentials are equal.

Figure 3-2   Equipotential surfaces that form a defocusing lens in an electron gun. 
 
 
The equipotential surfaces to the right of the 5-kV contour in Figure 3-2 all 
bow toward the aperture in the anode. Electrons tend to have trajectories that are 
perpendicular to equipotential surfaces because that is the direction in which the 
electric field is strongest, so that is why Region 2 is a beam-defocusing region. 
 
In Figure 3-3, single aperture lenses are shown and the focusing actions of 
these lenses are indicated. Each electrode set in Figure 3-3 consists of three 
parallel plates with voltages such that V3 > V2 > V1. The center plate at potential 
V2 is equally spaced from the other two and has a circular aperture. In this section, 
a simple relation is developed to determine the focal length, f, in terms of the 
applied voltages. This focal length can be used in the analysis of electron guns. 
 
As shown in Figure 3-3(a), if the voltage difference between plates 1 and 2 is 
larger than that between plates 2 and 3, the equipotential contours near the 
aperture will bulge into the region between 2 and 3. An electron traveling parallel 
to the axis in regions 1â2 will have its trajectory deflected away from the axis in 
regions 2â3. 
 
For the case shown in Figure 3-3(b), the voltage difference between plates 2 
and 3 is larger than between 1 and 2 and so the equipotential contours near the 
aperture bulge into the region 1â2. An electron traveling parallel to the axis in 
region 1â2 will have its trajectory deflected toward the axis in region 2â1. 
 
Assuming that V1 = 0 and that an electron leaves electrode 1 with negligible 
velocity, then the velocity of the electron at electrode 2 at z = 0 is

The approximation made here is that the voltage at z = 0 in the aperture is the same 
as that on electrode 2.  
 
As is indicated in Figure 3-4(a), in the vicinity of the aperture in the center 
electrode, where the equipotential surfaces are curved, there is a radial component 
to the electric field, Er. This radial field produces a radial force on the electron and 
a radial velocity component, ur, which can be obtained from

3.4   UNIVERSAL BEAM SPREAD CURVE 
 
Earlier in this chapter, the motions of individual electrons under the influence of 
applied fields were examined. In this section, as was done in the discussion of 
Region 3 in an electron gun in Chapter 2, it will be assumed that there are no 
applied fields. A beam of electrons is assumed and the only electric fields are 
those produced by the electrons. This analysis differs from that in Chapter 2 
because the radial motions of the electrons and radial decelerating and accelerating 
forces are considered. 
 
The situation that will be analyzed is like that shown in Figure 3-5. The 
electron beam is converging as it approaches z = zm, but the forces between 
electrons cause the beam to stop converging and then to diverge.

In Chapter 5, it will be shown that the relation between current and voltage in most 
thermionic diodes, including the electron guns on klystrons and TWTs is given by 
(3-32). The quantity P is called the perveance and depends only on the geometry 
of the diode or electron gun. Now, by substituting A into (3-30), the following

Plots of B as a function of Z can be generated for various values of dBo/dZ by 
selecting values of dB/dZ and then calculating corresponding values of B and Z. 
The result is in Figure 3-6. These curves are symmetrical about the position of the 
minimum beam radius. As dBo/dZ is made more negative, the minimum first 
moves to the right (+Z direction) and then to the left. Thus, for a given perveance, 
there is an optimum value of dBo/dZ that maximizes the length of a tunnel through 
which a beam can travel without being intercepted by the tunnel walls. 
 
In the design of an electron gun, the position of the minimum beam radius 
will be of interest. This position, Zmin, as a function of dBo/dZ can be determined 
by evaluating (3-41) with dB/dZ = 0. The result is shown in Figure 3-7. 
 
A version of this curve that can be obtained by changing the initial conditions 
to the position where the minimum beam radius occurs and by normalizing the 
radius and axial distance with respect to the minimum radius, bm, is the universal 
beam spread curve shown in Figure 3-8. The curve is symmetrical about z = zo. 
This curve describes the shape of an electron beam in a field-free space. One of its 
uses is in periodic focusing systems where this curve describes the shape of the 
beam between lenses.

Influence of Magnetic Field on Electron 
Motion 
 
 
Magnetic fields are used in nearly all microwave tubes for controlling the motions 
of the electrons. In this chapter, the motion of an electron in a static magnetic field 
is considered first. Then the motion in combined electric and magnetic fields is 
examined. After a general consideration of axially symmetric fields, Buschâs 
theorem is derived. This theorem applies when axial and radial electric or 
magnetic fields are present, and is extremely important in the analysis of electron 
beams in all linear-beam tubes.  
  
 
4.1   ELECTRON MOTION IN A STATIC MAGNETIC FIELD  
 
The force, F, produced by magnetic flux, B, on an electron moving with velocity, 
u, is

(4-1) 
The quantities F, B, and u are bold to indicate that they are vectors. The vector 
product 
Ã
u
B is maximum when the vectors are perpendicular. For vectors that 
are not perpendicular, the vector product decreases by the sine of the angle 
between vectors. 
 
Figure 4-1 shows the trajectory of an electron traveling with velocity uo at a 
right angle to the direction of the flux density, B, which is constant. The force on 
the electron is euoB. An easy way to determine the direction of the force on the 
electron is by using the right-hand rule. As is indicated in Figure 4-1, 
 
 
1. Point fingers toward direction of charge velocity, uo. 
 
2. Rotate fingers toward magnetic field, B. 
 
3. Thumb points to force on positive charge, F+. 
 
4. Force on electron is opposite.

The force deflects the trajectory of the electron as shown in Figure 4-1 and, 
because its direction is perpendicular to the trajectory of the electron, it does not 
change the speed of the electron. Since the speed is constant, the force is constant. 
The result is that the path of the electron is circular.

The radius of the path can be determined by considering the outward 
centrifugal force on the electron as it follows the circular path. The magnitude of 
this force is muo
2/r, where r is the radius of the electron path. This outward force 
equals the inward force produced by the magnetic field so

The frequency with which the electron rotates is easy to determine because 
the path length for one rotation is 2Ïr and the velocity is uo. Thus, the time 
required for each revolution is

 and this is the example considered earlier. As shown in Figure 4-2, 
with an initial velocity of uo = 0 in the x direction, the electron follows a circular 
trajectory in the clockwise direction.  
 
With uo and Bz remaining constant, as the electric field is increased from zero, 
the electron trajectories change dramatically. For example, consider the trajectory 
when Ey has been increased so that

electric field is in the + y direction and, as the electron moves away from x = 0, 
this opposes the y-directed magnetic force. As a result, the electron trajectory 
gradually moves outside the Ey = 0 path. As Ey continues to decelerate the 
electron, the y component of velocity eventually becomes zero.  
 
At the same time, as the velocity is decreased, the radius of curvature, which 
is u/Ïc, is reduced. Then, as the electric and magnetic forces accelerate the 
electron in the +y direction, the trajectory takes on the shape of a teardrop.

Electron motions similar to these occur in a circular format in a magnetron 
where the electric field is radial and the magnetic field is parallel to the axis. 
 
4.2.2   Axially Symmetric Fields 
 
In Chapter 3, we examined the motions of electrons in a beam when only space 
charge forces are present. This led to the universal beam spread analysis. The 
effect of a magnetic field was not included in that analysis. In this section, we will 
derive Buschâs theorem, which is a powerful tool used in the analysis of the 
motion of electrons when axial and radial electric and magnetic fields are present. 
In Chapter 7, Buschâs theorem will be used with the universal beam spread 
analysis to define the behavior of magnetically focused electron beams. Forces 
resulting from axial electron motions, z , and a radial component, Br, of the 
magnetic flux density will be included so that the Î¸ force equation is

To attach physical significance to this equation, consider a ring of electrons 
moving axially and expanding radially as shown in Figure 4-3. Assume that the 
ring is crossing magnetic flux lines. As the ring expands radially, it crosses axial 
components of the magnetic flux. The total axial flux crossed,

Thermionic Cathodes 
 
 
The cathode is the source of electrons for the electron beam in every microwave 
tube. The current density of electron emission from the cathode ranges from 
milliamperes to tens of amperes per square centimeter of cathode area. 
 
Two cathode emission mechanisms are used in conventional tubes: 
 
 
â¢ 
Thermionic emission; 
 
â¢ 
Secondary emission. 
 
 
In cathodes for linear-beam tubes, only thermionic emission is used. 
Thermionic cathodes are the primary subject for discussion in this chapter. 
Secondary emission cathodes are used in crossed-field tubes such as magnetrons 
and crossed-field amplifiers. Those cathodes and their applications are discussed 
in Chapter 18.  
 
J. R. Pierce [1] listed the primary characteristics that an ideal cathode should 
have: 
 
 
1. Emits electrons freely, without any form of persuasion such as heating or 
bombardment (electrons would leak off from it into vacuum as easily as 
they pass from one metal to another); 
 
2. Emits copiously, supplying an unlimited current density; 
 
3. Lasts forever, its electron emission continuing unimpaired as long as it is 
needed; 
 
4. Emits electrons uniformly, traveling at practically zero velocity. 
 
 
Of course, real cathodes have none of these ideal characteristics. For example, 
real cathodes must be heated to a temperature near 1,000Â°C to produce appreciable 
electron emission. At that temperature, the current density is not unlimited, but 
instead is on the order of a few tens of amperes per square centimeter at most. 
Because of the necessity for a high operating temperature, some of the key 
constituents of a cathode evaporate, which leads to their depletion and, eventually, 
to the end of the life of the cathode. 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
40 
 
The reason for the fourth characteristic of an ideal cathode is not as obvious as 
the other three. First, it should be noted that, in real cathodes, there are random 
microscopic fluctuations in the rate at which electrons are emitted. Second, 
electrons are emitted with finite random velocities in random directions relative to 
the cathode surface. There are at least two important reasons why an ideal cathode 
should âemit electrons uniformly, traveling at practically zero velocityâ: 
 
 
1. Fluctuations in electron emission and variations in electron emission 
velocities lead to noise currents in the electron beam, which produce 
noise on the output from the tube. 
 
2. Variations in emission velocities and in the directions with which 
electrons leave the cathode surface lead to problems in focusing the 
electrons into a well-defined beam. This problem is particularly severe in 
very small, high-density beams. 
 
 
While real cathodes have none of the characteristics that Pierceâs ideal 
cathode would have, there has been enormous progress in cathode capabilities 
since Pierce listed his ideal characteristics. This progress is indicated in Figure 
5-1. Note, in particular, the large increase in emission capability that was achieved 
in the 1970s and 1980s. As pointed out by Thomas et al., this progress was due 
largely to the advent of modern surface analytical capabilities that made possible a 
better understanding of the physics and chemistry of emitter surfaces [2]. In this 
chapter, we attempt to provide sufficient background material so that, at least 
qualitatively, the operation of modern cathodes, with the exception of the scandate 
cathode, can be understood. The operation of the scandate cathode is the subject of 
active research at the present time. 
 
The chapter starts with the basic theory of thermionic emission. This theory is 
straightforward and gives a reasonably accurate prediction of the maximum 
emission that can be expected from a cathode at a given temperature, in the 
absence of field effects, if the work function is known. Next, the enhancement of 
thermionic emission that results from the application of an electric field to the 
surface of the cathode (the Schottky effect) is discussed. The emission regulating 
effect of the electron cloud adjacent to the surface of the cathode (space charge 
limited emission) is of extreme importance in the use of thermionic cathodes in 
linear-beam tubes. For the person who must use a cathode in a linear-beam tube, 
the concept of space charge limited emission may be the most important material 
discussed in this chapter. 
 
To maintain space charge limited emission, the cathode work function must 
remain low enough so that adequate emission is obtained at a given temperature 
during the life of a cathode. The work function of the cathode is critically 
dependent on the materials and condition of the surface of the cathode. Thus, a 
large portion of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of cathode materials and 
their impact on life of the cathode and the tube in which it is used.

The physical arrangement of the cathode and the elements that provide the 
power necessary to heat it to the required temperature in the time permitted by the 
application are described. Conventional heaters are discussed along with fast 
warm-up assemblies that are required in some special applications of tubes. 
 
The magnetic field of the filament can have a significant impact on the 
operation of an electron gun. Electron trajectories near the cathode surface are 
perturbed by this field with the result that beam generation and focusing are 
degraded. If an ac filament current is used, the beam shape may be modulated at 
the ac frequency and this, in turn, modulates the power output of the tube. These 
effects are discussed at the end of the chapter. 
 
 
5.1   EMISSION MECHANISMS 
 
5.1.1   Thermionic Emission [3, 4] 
 
At temperatures above absolute zero, some electrons have sufficient energy to 
escape from a cathode surface. As temperature is increased, the number of 
electrons with sufficient energy to escape increases. In addition to temperature, the 
nature of the surface of the cathode has an extremely strong effect on the rate at 
which electrons are emitted. Electron emission resulting from the heating of a 
surface is referred to as thermionic emission. 
 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
42 
 
The fundamental aspects of thermionic emission may be understood with the 
aid of Figure 5-2, which is the classical energy level diagram for electrons near the 
interface between a cathode and vacuum. In the cathode, the parabolic curves 
represent electron energy levels adjacent to atoms. The energy levels merge to 
form the conduction band. At a temperature of absolute zero (0K), no electrons 
have energy greater than Eo, which is the top of the conduction band and is called 
the Fermi level. The difference in energy between the top of the conduction band 
in the cathode and the vacuum level adjacent to the cathode is known as the work 
function, commonly denoted by eÏ. 
 
At temperatures above absolute zero, some electrons have energy greater than 
Eo. Emission of the electrons can occur if their energy is Eo + eÏ or greater. It is 
necessary to keep in mind, however, that the electrons move in random directions 
within the cathode. Those moving toward the surface have the highest probability

The most significant aspect of the Richardson-Dushman equation is the 
exponential variation of current density with work function and temperature. The 
variation of current density with 
2
T is negligible by comparison. This can be 
readily demonstrated by considering the relative effects of a small change in 
temperature. For example, for a typical operating temperature of 1,000Â°C, a 1% 
change in T produces roughly a 70% change in the value of the exponential term, 
but only a 2% change in 
2
T .

In practice, the experimental value of Ao turns out to be on the order of one-
quarter to one-half of the predicted value. Two reasons for this are:  
 
 
1. The work function has been assumed to be independent of temperature. In 
fact, eÏ may vary with temperature. 
 
2. The same value of eÏ has been assumed for all parts of the emitting 
surface. In fact, eÏ may be different for different crystal surfaces. 
Suppose, for example, that half of the emitter area has work function eÏ1 
and the other half has work function eÏ2 where eÏ2 > eÏ1. Then, because 
of the exponential dependence of emission on work function, practically 
all of the emission will be from the eÏ1 areas. The emitting area is, 
therefore, only half of the nominal cathode area, and the measured value 
of Ao is only half of the theoretical value. 
 
 
From the Richardson-Dushman equation, it is clear that to obtain high values 
of emission, the work function must be low and the temperature must be high. 
Unfortunately, as shown in Table 5-1, when pure metals are considered, materials 
with low work functions also have low melting temperatures. Cesium, with a work 
function of 2.1 eV and a melting temperature of 28Â°C, is an extreme example. 
Barium also has a reasonably low work function, but has a moderate melting 
temperature (725Â°C). It turns out that barium is commonly used in thermionic 
cathodes, but not because it has a low work function. Instead, barium is used 
because of its capability (accompanied by other elements including oxygen) to 
reduce the work function of the underlying metal surface. Thus, even though they 
have high work functions, it is possible to use high melting temperature metals 
such as tungsten and osmium by introducing barium and other elements to reduce 
the work function of the surface. 
 
Figure 5-4 shows theoretical emission densities as functions of temperature 
and work function (dashed lines). Also shown are measured emission densities for 
several cathodes, most of which contain metals listed in Table 5-1. For W and 
ThW, the experimental curves are located where expected, based on the values of 
eÏ in Table 5-1. (For ThW, thorium diffuses to the surface of the tungsten and so 
the work function is approximately that of thorium.) Notice that, for the cathodes 
containing barium (BaW, BaNi, Type B, Alloy, Scandate, and Oxide), the 
locations of the experimental curves indicate work functions well below that of 
barium (~ 2.7 eV). In most cases it is the interaction of the barium and other 
elements with the underlying metal that produces the low work function. This will 
be discussed later in this chapter when the theory of cathode operation is 
examined.

5.1.2   Schottky Effect 
 
In the derivation of the Richardson-Dushman equation, the effect of an electric 
field at the cathode surface was not taken into consideration and so neither voltage 
nor electric field appear in the equation. In fact, when an electric field is applied to 
the surface of a cathode, it is found that the emission increases slightly. 
 
The reason for this effect may be explained with the aid of Figure 5-5. As was 
shown in Figure 5-2 and again in Figure 5-5(a), an electron must be emitted with 
energy eÏ or greater to overcome the work function barrier at the surface of the 
cathode. When a positive voltage exists on an anode near the cathode, then an 
electric field, Ea, is applied to the region between the cathode and anode. Near the 
cathode surface, as shown in Figure 5-5(b), this field reduces the barrier that 
electrons must overcome to be emitted so that more electrons are emitted. The 
resulting increase in emission current is called the Schottky effect. The amount by 
which the work function is reduced is eÎÏ where

where Jo is the Richardson-Dushman current density and is sometimes referred to 
as the zero-field current density [5]. Jo is a useful parameter for comparing 
performances of different cathodes. 
 
In practice, to determine Jo experimentally, it is necessary to extrapolate from 
values measured at relatively high electric fields. This is because, at low electric 
field levels, electrons near the cathode surface alter the applied electric field. This 
is known as the electron space charge effect and will be discussed.

This indicates that a plot of ln J versus E1/2 should be a straight line with an 
intercept, when extrapolated to E = 0, of the value of ln Jo. This is illustrated in 
Figure 5-6. Note that, at low values of electric field, the measured value of current 
density falls below the extrapolated value because of the effect of the charge of the 
electrons in the region near the cathode surface. Some error in Jo may result from 
the change of the true work function by the applied electric field. 
 
5.1.3   Field Emission 
 
As the electric field applied to the surface of a cathode is increased to the

10
V/m
â
 (0.1â1.0 V/Ã) level, it is found that electron emission increases 
very rapidly. Furthermore, the increase in emission is almost independent of 
cathode temperature. 
 
The energy profile is like that for the Schottky effect (Figure 5-5), except that 
the applied field is much larger. As a result, as indicated in Figure 5-7, the width 
of the potential barrier at the surface of the cathode is very narrow. Because of the 
wave nature of the electron, there is some probability that an electron can exist on 
the vacuum side of the barrier even though it does not have sufficient kinetic 
energy to overcome the barrier. This is known as the tunneling effect.

The resulting electron is called field emission. Field emission increases 
exponentially with applied voltage. Because extremely large emission densities are 
possible, there have been many attempts to develop field emission cathodes for  
microwave tubes. To achieve the high electric field levels necessary for substantial 
emission, it has been necessary to fabricate the cathodes from arrays of very small 
needle-shaped emitters. The needle shape is used to enhance the electric field, so 
that emission occurs at the tip of each emitter, as illustrated in Figure 5-8. 
Unfortunately, emitted electrons ionize gas molecules to form positive ions, which 
damage the tips of the emitters and degrade emission.

5.1.4   Space Charge Limitation [6, 7] 
 
The effect of the negative charge of an electron is to reduce the potential that is 
present in the absence of the electron. Near an emitting cathode where many 
electrons are present, the reduction in potential can be appreciable. This is shown 
for a parallel-plane diode in Figure 5-9. With no electrons, the potential increases 
linearly from the cathode to the anode. With electrons, the potential profile is 
depressed as indicated by the dashed line.

As the electron emission rate is increased (by increasing temperature, for 
example), the potential is further decreased. As indicated by Figure 5-10, there is a 
limit to how far the electron emission rate can be increased. This limit occurs 
when the density of electrons adjacent to the cathode surface becomes so large that 
it tends to depress the potential below zero. If the potential were to become 
negative, electrons would be forced back to the cathode.

Figure 5-10   (aâc) Potential profiles near the surface of the cathode. 
 
 
In Figure 5-10(a), the electric field at the cathode surface causes all emitted 
electrons to leave the cathode, thereby depressing the potential near the surface. In 
Figure 5-10(b) the electric field at the cathode surface forces electrons back to the 
cathode surface and increases the potential. An equilibrium condition occurs 
when, as shown in Figure 5-10(c), the potential adjacent to the cathode surface is 
zero, that is, when the electric field at the cathode surface is zero. If the potential 
tends to become positive, more electrons flow from the cathode, thereby 
depressing the potential. If the potential tends to become negative, fewer electrons 
flow from the cathode, thereby raising the potential. 
 
When the electric field at the cathode surface is forced to zero by the electron 
cloud near the cathode surface, the emission is said to be space charge limited. 
When a sufficient number of electrons are present so that emission is space charge 
limited, then cathode temperature and surface condition have no effect on 
emission. This is indeed a very fortunate situation because it eliminates the 
necessity for extreme uniformity of temperature across the surface of a cathode. It 
also eliminates the necessity for precise control of the voltage and current to the 
heater in the cathode. When the voltage is increased in a diode with a space charge 
limited cathode, the potential at all points between the cathode and anode tends to 
increase. As a result, additional electrons flow from the cathode to cause the 
electric field at the cathode surface to remain at zero. It is evident, therefore, that 
diode current is dependent on anode voltage. 

Thermionic Cathodes

The relation between voltage and current in a parallel-plane, space charge 
limited diode can be determined in a straightforward manner. It is assumed that the 
electric field at the cathode surface is zero, as is indicated in Figure 5-10.

for a parallel-plane diode. Perveance is a function only of geometry. Space charge 
limited diodes with geometries other than planar such as cylindrical and spherical 
all obey I = PV3/2, where the expression for perveance is the one appropriate for 
the geometry used. 
 
In this analysis, it has been assumed that the velocities of the electrons are 
zero when they are emitted. In fact, electrons are emitted with small initial 
velocities. If the electric field was zero at the cathode surface, all of the emitted 
electrons would be able to leave the surface and the saturation emission, Jo (total 
thermionic emission capability of the cathode), would flow. In practice, space 
charge limited emission is much less than saturated emission  because the presence 
of large quantities of electrons near the surface causes a potential minimum to be 
formed just outside the cathode surface. The voltage at the minimum is a small 
fraction of a volt below cathode potential. Only the most energetic electrons can 
overcome this potential minimum and pass on to the anode. The less energetic 
electrons are returned to the cathode.  
 
The effect of increasing the anode voltage so that more current flows is to 
decrease the depth of the potential minimum and move it closer to the cathode. As 
J approaches the saturation current density, Jo, dV/dx approaches 0 at the cathode 
surface. If the voltage is increased further, current will be limited to the saturation 
current density and space charge limited operation will cease. 
 
In practice, space charge limited diodes behave as predicted. This is readily 
demonstrated by plotting current as a function of voltage using two-thirds power 
graph paper. As shown in Figure 5-11, the resulting plot is a straight line for space 
charge limited operation. The slope of the line is the perveance. 
 
When the voltage is increased to a value high enough so that the cathode 
cannot supply sufficient current to maintain the space charge limited condition, the 
cathode is said to be TL (temperature limited). The TL region is readily apparent in 
the two-thirds power I-V graph because the plotted results depart from a straight 
line. 
 
In Figure 5-12, current is shown plotted as a function of temperature for a 
thermionic cathode. In the region of TL operation, current increases with 
temperature. At high temperatures, current is independent of temperature, 
indicating space charge limited operation. As voltage is increased, the temperature 
at which the transition from TL to space charge limited operation occurs is 
increased.

As indicated in Figure 5-13, the TL portion of a current versus temperature

a cathode that remains above the knee of the curve for the life of the cathode. The 
rate at which the TL curve moves increases with increasing temperature, so an 
excessive temperature will reduce cathode life. 
 
In Figure 5-13, there is a slight upward slope with increasing temperature in 
the space charge limited region. This is caused by the movement of the cathode 
toward the anode as a result of thermal expansion of elements of the cathode 
support structure.

The mechanisms dominating current flow in a thermionic diode are 
summarized in Figure 5-14. At low voltages, current is space charge limited. As 
voltage is increased, the emission limit of the cathode is reached and current 
becomes dependent on cathode temperature. Current continues to increase slowly 
with voltage because of the Schottky effect. At high voltages, field emission 
causes current to increase rapidly. 
 
 
5.2   EVOLUTION OF THERMIONIC CATHODES 
 
The first thermionic cathodes used in quantity were those in early radio tubes. 
They were made from pure tungsten, although other cathode materials were 
known that were capable of producing adequate emission at lower temperatures 
than tungsten. Because of the high work function (~ 4.6 eV), the operating 
temperature was high. For example, 2,200Â°C yields about 0.3 A/cm2. Apparently, 
tungsten was used in early tubes rather than other cathodes because it was 
foolproof. A tungsten cathode always had plenty of emission. Other cathodes were 
temperamental and were sometimes âpoisonedâ by mysterious agents.

For some applications, thorium oxide in a concentration of about 2% is added 
to tungsten in the process of making the tungsten wire for the cathode. By 
processing, thorium is brought to the surface of the tungsten. The work function of 
thorium is well below that of tungsten, so the emission is about 1,000 times higher 
than for tungsten. 
 
The cathode surface is sometimes carburized, that is, heated in a vapor of a 
hydrocarbon such as alcohol, so that a layer of tungsten carbide is formed on the 
surface. This increases cathode life by reducing the rate of evaporation of thorium 
and protecting the cathode from ion bombardment. 
 
The life expectancy of high-power switch tubes containing thoriated tungsten 
cathodes is shown in Figure 5-15. Thoriated tungsten cathodes are in common use 
in high-power switch tubes, transmitter tubes, and microwave oven magnetrons. 
 
Early cathodes were all directly heated, that is, the filament, which was heated 
by passing a current through it, was also the cathode. Thus, as a result of the heater 
current, there was a voltage variation along the surface of the cathode. Because 
batteries were used as power sources, the filament voltage was dc, so there was no 
modulation of the emission current. 
 
The development of ac radios and the need to heat the filaments with ac 
current brought about the need for a cathode, the surface of which was all at the 
same potential. The indirectly heated cathode resulted, whereby the heater was 
separate from the electron emitting surface. Directly and indirectly heated 
cathodes are illustrated in Figure 5-16. 
 
In indirectly heated cathodes, tungsten is used for the filament. Because of 
heat losses and the relatively large cathode area, the cathode surface had to operate 
at a temperature substantially below the heater temperature. This provided the 
requirement for a low work function emitting surface

Thermionic Cathodes

The oxide-coated cathode, which was discovered by Wehnelt in 1904, long 
before radio tubes, provided the solution to the problem because of its very low 
work function (â1.5 eV) and resulting low operating temperature. Oxide-coated 
cathodes served the industry well from the 1920s through World War II and into 
the early 1950s. They are still prevalent today in applications requiring relatively 
modest cathode emission and long life. Early oxide-coated cathodes were 
described by J. R. Pierce [1] as follows: 
 
 
The early history of oxide coated cathodes seemed without rhyme or 
reason. It was found that if a wire intended to emit electrons was heated 
and rubbed with sealing wax and the sealing wax then burned off a truly 
phenomenal cathode was produced. Further work traced the emission to 
alkaline earth oxides, and the compound from which they came was 
humorously described as a barium resinate. The sealing wax technique 
died hard, and for several years the process of coating filaments consisted 
in stringing fine platinum ribbon out in long lengths, heating it with an 
electric current, and rubbing a resinous compound containing barium and 
strontium over it repeatedly. The narrow ribbon was then cut into lengths, 
put into a crude vacuum tube of the day, the tube was pumped and baked 
until a âhard vacuumâ was achieved, and the filament was activated. This 
activation was a wishful process consisting of glowing the filament 
brightly, applying voltage, and drawing current to the plate until, in 
happy circumstances the plate got red-hot, giving off enough gas to 
produce a blue glow and further increase the activity and the current. 
After a lucky period of this treatment the filament became active; that is, 
it would emit electrons at a lower and reasonable temperature, at which it 
would last for a number of thousands of hours. 
 
 
The art and science of oxide cathodes are now highly developed. A mixture of 
barium, strontium, and calcium carbonates is applied to a metal base (usually 
nickel) and then activated in vacuum. Activation consists of heating and reducing 
the carbonates to oxides. 
 
As oxide-coated cathodes were improved, dc emission increased from 
mA/cm2 to hundreds of mA/cm2. Pulsed emission densities are dependent on pulse 
length and can be as high as tens of A/cm2. Oxide-coated cathodes are not capable 
of high dc emission densities because of the high resistivity of the coating and the 
resistive heating that occurs at high currents. They are also easily poisoned. 
 
The search for better cathodes than oxide-coated cathodes resulted from their 
low dc emission and susceptibility to damage. The L cathode, illustrated in Figure 
5-17, was developed by Philips about 1950. In this cathode, the emissive material 
is sandwiched between the heater and a porous tungsten pellet. During operation, 
emissive material diffuses through the porous tungsten and forms a low work 
function emitting surface.

Cathodes like the L cathode are referred to as reservoir cathodes for the 
obvious reason that a reservoir of emissive material is used. Early problems have 
been overcome and structures like the L cathode are now in use. Some of these are 
referred to as MK cathodes. 
 
A reservoir cathode, developed by the Naval Research Laboratory, is known 
as the controlled porosity dispenser (CPD) cathode. The reservoir contains BaO, 
CaO, and Al2O3, as well as particles of tungsten, which act as a reducing agent that 
frees barium from the BaO. The CPD cathode uses a thin sheet of tungsten or alloy 
(to be discussed next) in which pores have been etched or drilled with a laser. The 
CPD approach to cathode construction offers advantages of improved emission 
uniformity and improved reproducibility and performance. At present, the 
difficulties of fabricating CPD cathodes, especially for concave cathodes, limit 
their usefulness. 
 
From 1950 to 1955, the evolution of the impregnated dispenser cathode 
illustrated in Figure 5-18 occurred. The Philips B-type cathode developed by Levi 
is still in use by the microwave tube industry. The pores of a porous tungsten 
pellet are impregnated with a compound of BaO, CaO, and Al2O3. Barium is 
released when the impregnant reacts with the tungsten. The freed barium migrates 
to the surface of the porous tungsten to form the emitting surface. A common 
emissive mix used in the B-type cathode consists of five parts BaO, three parts 
CaO, and two parts Al2O3 and is frequently referred to simply as 5:3:2. Other 
mixes are 6:1:2 and 4:1:1. The 4:1:1 cathode is sometimes referred to as an S-type 
cathode. The choice of mix depends on the application of the cathode [8]. For 
example, the 5:3:2 cathode is often used in large tubes at low emission densities. 
The 6:1:2 cathode has very good poisoning resistance and a low barium 
evaporation rate and is recommended for most applications. The 4:1:1 cathode is 
very active and poison-resistant and can usually be operated 30Â°C cooler than 
other types. 
 
The B-type cathode is rugged and relatively impervious to damage and can 
readily provide emission densities of several A/cm2. At these high densities, the 
operating temperature must be 1,100Â°C or higher because of the relatively high 
work functions of these cathodes. As a result, life is limited to a few thousand 
hours.

The search for a cathode capable of an emission density comparable to 
the B-type cathode, but with a lower operating temperature and longer life, led to 
the development of the M-type cathode in the 1960s. In its simplest form, the 
M-type is a B-type with a film several thousand Angstroms thick of osmium, 
iridium, or rhenium applied to the surface. Compared to a  B cathode, the effect of 
the film is to reduce the work function ~ 0.2 eV and the cathode operating 
temperature ~ 90Â°C (dependent on film metal). 
 
A problem early in the development of M cathodes was degradation of the 
enhancing film. At normal operating temperatures, the tungsten substrate and 
coating metal would interdiffuse, and an alloy surface was formed with a 
composition that changed with time. The lowest work function occurs when the 
alloy is about 50/50 tungsten and coating metal. Thus, during the life of one a 
cathode, emission would actually increase at first, then degrade, and then 
eventually revert to that of a B cathode as the surface became tungsten. 
 
Several fabrication techniques for controlling the properties of the alloy 
formed on the surface of an M cathode have been examined. In one cathode, the 
mixed metal matrix (MMM) cathode, the cathode pellet contains particles of the 
enhancing metal (usually iridium). Fabrication is difficult because the size 
distribution of the tungsten and iridium particles must be carefully controlled. In 
the controlled doping (CD) cathode developed by Varian, multiple layers of alloy 
material, having different compositions, are deposited. The composition of the 
layers is adjusted to minimize interdiffusion of the tungsten and the enhancing 
metal. A few percent of the enhancing metal can be added to the tungsten matrix 
prior to coating and this reduces the diffusion of tungsten into the coatings.

The performance characteristics of the cathodes just described are 
summarized in Figure 5-19. The increase in emission capability over B cathodes of 
cathodes containing osmium, iridium, or rhenium is clearly shown.

For several years, there has been considerable interest in scandate cathodes. 
These cathodes have a very low work function (â1.5 eV) and are capable of 
emission densities on the order of 100 A/cm2 for thousands of hours. In one 
version developed by Philips, the emitting surface is composed of a layer of 
tungsten mixed with Sc2O3 (â5% by weight). The entire matrix of the cathode is 
impregnated with BaO, CaO, and Al2O3. While these cathodes are being used in 
some applications (see, for example, [9, 10]), they are not yet in widespread use 
because of nonuniform emission, which leads to a very broad work function 
distribution (discussed in the following sections) and also because of a lack of 
robustness such as poor resistance to the effects of ion bombardment  [11]. 
 
 
5.3   IMPREGNATED DISPENSER CATHODES 
 
5.3.1   Fabrication 
 
At present, the most commonly used cathodes in the microwave tube industry are 
impregnated dispenser cathodes. These are fabricated from small grains of 
tungsten that have been pressed together under high pressure and sintered at a 
temperature of over 2,000Â°C for 1 to 2 hours to form porous billets. The pores are

then filled with a plastic material to facilitate rough machining to the desired 
shape. After machining, the plastic is removed and the porous matrix is filled with 
a compound containing barium oxide, calcium oxide, and aluminum oxide. 
 
Usually, there is then an additional machining operation of the emitter surface 
to the final dimensions. This is a difficult procedure because the cathode is a 
porous structure. Care must be taken to avoid excess smearing of the tungsten over 
the pore openings. If the pore openings become plugged, then, during cathode 
operation, the emissive compound will be prevented from diffusing to the cathode 
surface. Figure 5-20 shows the surface and interior of a cathode after final 
machining. The differences between grain sizes and pore distributions between the 
surface and the interior show that significant smearing occurred during machining.

(From: R. L. Ives et al., IEEE Trans. Electron Devices, December 2005. Â© 2005 IEEE.) 
 
 
Before a new dispenser cathode is installed in an electron gun, the cathode 
surface is usually processed to remove excess impregnant. One technique is to 
place the cathode in a vacuum chamber (not the tube in which it will eventually be 
installed) and heat it to a high temperature. This causes the excess impregnant to 
evaporate from the cathode surface. Another technique is a liquid cleaning 
process, referred to as SRLV or EDTA cleaning [12]. This process removes a 
shallow layer of impregnant from the tungsten surface. 
 
Figure 5-21 shows the scale of the features of the surface (without smearing) 
of a typical B-type cathode [13â15]. A coated cathode (M type, for example) has a 
very thin film of enhancing metal on the surfaces of the tungsten grains. Note that 
all dimensions are typically a few microns. Note also that there is a wide 
distribution in the sizes of the tungsten grains and that they are irregularly shaped. 
This results in there being a lack of control over the porosity of the cathode surface 
and this contributes to the variability of the work function of the cathode (to be 
discussed next).

It should be pointed out that, over the years, there have been many attempts to 
control the porosity of a cathode surface. The work of the Naval Research 
Laboratory is mentioned earlier in this chapter. None of these attempts has found 
application for any one of several reasons [16]. Ives et al. [16] proposed a novel 
technique for controlling porosity that appears to overcome many of the 
shortcomings of previous techniques. Tungsten wires are sintered to form the 
uniform array of pores of uniform size shown in Figure 5-22.

5.3.2   Operation 
 
When a cathode is heated to the operating temperature, barium is released from the 
interior of the tungsten matrix by reactions of the impregnant with the tungsten. 
The freed barium migrates through the pores to the surface of the cathode. Once 
there, the barium migrates across the surface and eventually evaporates. The rate 
of diffusion of barium to the surface, along with the energy of desorption of 
barium atoms from the surface (which controls the evaporation rate), determines 
the surface coverage. 
 
It is important to avoid operating a cathode at a temperature that is higher than 
necessary because the rate of evaporation of barium is highly temperature 
dependent. Clearly, it is also important for the surface to be heated to a uniform 
temperature. The hottest portions of the cathode become depleted of barium 
soonest and this leads to reduced emission and the end of cathode life. It is 
desirable that the temperature should not vary more than a few degrees centigrade 
over the entire surface of the cathode. 
 
The work function of the cathode depends on the fraction of the cathode 
surface that is covered by barium along with the work function of the metal 
substrate. The reason for this will be discussed later in this chapter. An example of 
the variation of work function with surface coverage is shown in Figure 5-23. For 
optimum coverage, which turns out to be nearly a monolayer, the work function is 
a minimum. With time, as a cathode operates, the pores become depleted and the 
rate of diffusion of barium to the cathode surface decreases. As a result, the 
coverage of the surface decreases, the work function increases, the rate of 
emission decreases, and the space charge cloud may disappear. If that happens, 
emission becomes temperature limited. By increasing the cathode temperature, the 
rate of diffusion of barium to the surface can be increased, the rate of emission can 
be increased, and it may be possible to return to space charge limited operation. Of 
course, the increased temperature causes the rate of evaporation to increase and 
this hastens the return of temperature limited operation. 
 
5.3.3   Miram Curves 
 
Miram et al. developed a technique for presenting emission data that provides a 
powerful tool for comparing cathodes, for diagnosing their performance, and for 
helping to understand their operation [17, 18]. The basic concepts may be 
understood with the aid of Figure 5-24. Values of emission current are plotted as 
percentages of the FSCL current. Curves plotted in this manner are often referred 
to as Miram curves. Several curves are shown for TL operation. With the Miram 
technique, the curves are plotted for FSCL current densities that are separated by a 
factor of 2. From the Richardson-Dushman equation, the temperature difference 
required to produce an increase in current density by a factor of 2 is about 40Â°C, 
and, in fact, the TL curves are separated by about 40Â°C.

The use of Miram curves and work function distribution curves provides a 
technique, not only for evaluating cathode performance as functions of 
temperature and loading, but also for revealing defects in cathode fabrication and 
operation. Examples of Miram curves for defective cathodes are given in Figure 
5-25. The curves in Figure 5-25(a) were obtained from a cathode with chipped 
edges. The chipped regions had a higher effective work function than the central 
portion of the cathode. As a result, the emission plots exhibited two types of knees. 
The ones for the central portion were much like the knees for a good cathode. The 
other knees were very broad and occurred at higher temperatures. 

Thermionic Cathodes 
 
65 
 
Figure 5-25(b) shows results for a cathode for which the effective work 
function increased as the temperature was raised above 940Â°C. Note that, above 
940Â°C, the separation between the 8 A/cm2 curve and the 4 A/cm2 curve is greater 
than the separations between the 4 and 2 A/cm2 curves or the 2 and 1 A/cm2 
curves. This large change in separation indicates an increase in the work function. 
 
In the plots shown in Figure 5-25(c), the knees of the curves have changed, as 
indicated by the dashed lines. The change may have occurred as a function of 
time, or the change may represent the difference between a cathode assembly that 
is known to be operating properly and another assembly that is supposed to be 
identical to the first. If only the knees of the curves have changed as shown in 
Figure 5-25(c), then it is likely that something has caused a nonuniformity in the 
electric field near the cathode surface. With a gridded electron gun, this could be 
movement or misalignment of one of the grids. 
 
If both the spacing and shapes of the knees have changed as shown in Figure 
5-25(d), then there is a cathode emission problem and possibly a misalignment of 
gun electrodes.

5.3.4   Work Function Distribution 
 
Because the energy of desorption and the work function vary from grain to grain, 
the work function of a cathode is not a single valued quantity but instead has a

distribution of values. For example, the B cathode can have twice as many 
crystalline surface orientations as a coated cathode, causing a broader work 
function distribution as shown in Figure 5-26.

To understand the overall emission characteristic of a cathode, it is necessary 
to understand the distributed nature of the work function. An important 
consideration is the thickness of the electron space charge cloud at the surface of 
the cathode during space charge limited operation. Because of the finite velocities 
of emission of electrons, there is a small depression in the potential (~0.2V) near 
the surface of the cathode. The location of the position where the potential is a 
minimum is a measure of the thickness of the space charge cloud. Figure 5-27 
shows the distance between the potential minimum and the cathode surface. Note 
that, at emission densities of a few A/cm2, which are typical for coated dispenser 
cathodes, the position of the potential minimum is comparable to the tungsten 
grain size (see Figure 5-21) and thus the emission patch size, so we can conclude 
that the various patches emit independently at rates determined by their individual 
work functions [19]. 
 
Because the various patches operate independently, the surface of the cathode 
behaves like an array of diodes with varying work functions that are connected 
together in parallel. Thus, the emission characteristic for the cathode can be 
modeled as a parallel combination of the emission characteristics of the diodes 
(patches). In the temperature-limited (TL) region of operation of each patch, the 
Richardson-Dushman equation applies. In the space charge limited region 
(indicated by FSCL to show that the calculation is based on an operation that is 
fully space charge limited, that is, no part of a patch is operating temperature 
limited), the Child-Langmuir law applies.

Figure 5-28 shows, conceptually, how the TL and FSCL curves can be 
combined to obtain the overall emission characteristic (Miram curve), which is 
often called a roll-off curve. Notice that, below the FSCL current, emission 
consists of a combination of currents from patches that are operating TL and from 
patches that are operating SCL (space charge limited). In Figure 5-28, all currents 
are plotted as percentages of the FSCL values. It has been assumed that all 
emission patches operate at the same temperature and that the electric field applied 
by the anode is the same for all emission patches.

Cattelino and Miram have used the practical work function distribution 
(PWFD) as a tool for evaluating cathode quality and predicting life [20]. Figure 
5-29 shows how the PWFD plot is constructed. First, the Miram curve is overlaid 
on a set of TL emission curves calculated using the Richardson-Dushman 
equation. Currents up to the 0.5 FSCL value are normalized with respect to the 
FSCL current and plotted against the work function. Currents above the 0.5 FSCL 
value are subtracted from the FSCL current, normalized, and plotted against the 
work function.

Cattelino and Miram used PWFD to compare and cathodes. The best of class 
is the cathode of a particular type such as the M-type that has the best emission 
performance. The PWFD curves for best-of-class cathodes have the following 
characteristics: 
 
 
1. The curves are nearly the same for all current densities. 
 
2. The mean value and the width of the curves are nearly constant 
throughout life. 
 
3. The curves are narrow. 
 
 
Figure 5-30 contains PWFD plots for a best-of-class cathode and the plots in 
Figure 5-31 are for a cathode with a poor emission characteristic. The best-of-class 
curves in Figure 5-30 exhibit the second and third characteristics listed above. In 
addition, PWFD curves (not shown in Figure 5-30) at current densities of 2 and 4 
A/cm2 were nearly the same as those at 8 A/cm2. By comparison, the PWFD

curves in Figure 5-31 for a cathode with continual degradation in emission over its 
life show a continual shift in peak value toward higher work functions. Also, the 
widths of the curves increase with life indicating degradation in emission 
uniformity. Note that early in life, the best-of-class cathode had a lower peak 
PWFD work function (~1.78 eV) than the poor cathode (~1.81 eV).

Cattelino and Miram reported that the PWFD provides a means for predicting 
cathode performance and life expectancy. They noted that, in general, it has been 
observed that cathodes with similar PWFD characteristics tend to have similar life. 
Cathodes exhibiting best-of-class PWFD performance typically exhibit best-of-
class life expectancy.

A quantity related to the PWFD is emission spread. Miram et al. reported that 
emission spread, along with PWFD, is useful for evaluating cathodes for 
applications like the gyrotron, which require TL emitter operation [21]. As shown 
in Figure 5-32, emission spread is determined from the roll-off curve. It is defined 
at a specific TL operating point (Miram uses 40% of the FSCL current) and is the 
difference between the calculated (Richardson-Dushman) work function that 
produces the emitted current and the lowest measurable work function for the 
emission characteristic (1.80 eV in Figure 5-32). For the example in Figure 5-32, 
the emission spread is 0.035 eV.

Before leaving the subjects of PWFD and emission spread, it is of value in 
understanding the characteristics of scandate cathodes to show results reported by 
Miram et al. [21]. Figure 5-33 shows the emission spread and PWFD for a 
scandate cathode. The emission spread is 0.2 eV and indicates that, at the 
temperature of 700Â°C, most of the surface of the cathode is operating temperature 
limited. However, over a range of ~300Â°C from ~750Â°C to ~1,100Â°C, the cathode 
becomes space charge limited. This is an indication of the emission nonuniformity 
of present state-of-the-art scandate cathodes. 
 
 
5.4   LIFE CONSIDERATIONS 
 
Long-life requirements often range from 10,000 hours to over 100,000 hours. 
While life testing is sometimes done, it is more common to predict cathode life on

the basis of known cathode degradation mechanisms. Grant identified three 
distinguishable types of emission degradation mechanisms [19]: 
 
 
Type I 
gradual decrease in perveance, that is, FSCL emission decreases 
with time; 
 
Type II 
change in work function distribution with time and without 
dependence on changes in cathode temperature; 
 
Type III change in work function distribution with temperature as well as 
with time. 
 
 
The type II mechanism results from a change in the base metal work function with 
time. This mechanism applies to coated cathodes and is attributed to the diffusion 
of tungsten through the coating. Grant pointed out that the work function 
distribution can move to lower as well as higher work functions early in life 
depending on coating composition, thickness, and interdiffusion rate.

When the type III mechanism occurs, the work function distribution changes 
in a reversible manner as temperature changes. That is, if temperature is increased 
or decreased, the distribution increases or decreases and the measurements are 
repeatable. This can occur early in life and is attributed to an insufficient supply of 
barium, a change in sticking coefficient of the barium to the cathode surface or to 
external poisoning.

The reason given for the type I degradation is usually the gradual depletion of 
the barium supply in the impregnated tungsten pellet [2, 22â25]. Thus, the rate at 
which barium diffuses to the cathode surface decreases, so the barium coverage of 
the surface decreases and work function increases. 
 
Grant noted that the Miram curves do not always support the conclusion that 
barium coverage of the entire cathode depletes with time [19]. In some cases, a 
reduction in current persists even if cathode temperature is increased 150Â°C above 
the point where the cathode is 99.5% FSCL. If depletion of the entire cathode had 
been the reason for the reduced current, the increase in temperature would have 
increased the current. Grant stated that âthe preferred reason for the change in 
perveance is the complete depletion of barium from the edges of the cathode 
surface.â Depletion from the cathode edge is rapid because, if there is no barrier to 
diffusion on the outer diameter of the cathode pellet, barium can diffuse and 
evaporate radially outward as well as from the front surface of the cathode. 
 
A feature of Miram curves and of PWFD curves that results from barium 
depletion is the movement with time of the curves toward higher temperatures 
([13] and Figure 5-31). Another example is given in Figure 5-34. By observing the 
rate at which the curves shift to higher temperatures, life projections can be made. 
End of life is sometimes predicted to occur when the knee of the roll-off curve of 
interest reaches the operating temperature and emission current starts to drop or 
drops by a prescribed amount such as 10%. For the curves shown in Figure 5-34, 
the movement of the curves over a 2,500-hour period is shown. Assuming that the 
curves continue to move at the same rate, then the time for the 1 A/cm2 or the 2 
A/cm2 curves to reach the operating temperature (1,050Â°C) can be estimated. At 
4 A/cm2 the knee of the curve has already reached the operating temperature and 
current has dropped about 5%. For this current density, a 10% drop would soon 
occur. 
 
Under ideal conditions, the selection of the temperature at which a cathode 
should be operated to maximize life would be straightforward. For example, 
consider the roll-off curve shown in Figure 5-35. A cathode could have this 
emission characteristic if: 
 
 
1. All areas of the emitting surface had the same work function. 
 
2. There was no variation in temperature across the emitting surface. 
 
3. The electric field near the emitting surface was the same everywhere. 
 
End of life would occur when the knee of the curve reached the operating 
temperature and suddenly there was a precipitous drop in emission current. The 
operating temperature could be selected by using the life prediction model of 
Grant and Falce [26]. Life predictions for B and M cathodes are shown in Figure 
5-36 and in Figure 5-37.

5.4.1   Grant and Falce Life Prediction Model 
 
The model used to generate the curves in Figures 5-36 and 5-37 is based on the 
type I and type II degradation mechanisms (gradual depletion and base metal work 
function change). The model is valid for both B- and M-type cathodes, the only 
difference being the variation with time of the base metal work function in the M-
type alloy coatings. Life was defined as the first onset of temperature limited 
operation.

Grant and L. R. Falce, Third IEEE IVEC, April 2002, Â© 2002 IEEE.) 
 
 
As an example of the use of these curves for a B-type cathode having the 
emission characteristic in Figure 5-34, assume that life is to be maximized for 
operation at 1 A/cm2. The knee temperature in Figure 5-36 is slightly below 
1,000Â°C. Life is maximized with an operating temperature of ~1,050Â°C or ~50â
60Â°C above the knee temperature. It should be noted, however, that there is very 
little sacrifice in life if the operating temperature is only ~40Â°C or as much as 
~100Â°C above the knee temperature. 
  
The life advantage (over an order of magnitude) of the M cathode, compared 
with the B cathode, is the most striking feature of Figures 5-36 and 5-37. Unless 
there is some compelling reason to use a B cathode, it is clear that an M-type 
cathode should be used. 
  
An interesting characteristic of several of the M-cathode curves in Figure 
5-37, for example, the 1 A/cm2 curve, is that the cathodes have a longer life at 
temperatures below the initial knee temperature. This effect is due to a gradual 
change of the base-metal work function as tungsten diffuses into the M-type alloy 
coating.

Unfortunately, roll-off curves found for real cathodes donât have the sharp 
knee shown in Figure 5-35 but instead have a knee shape more like one of those 
shown in Figure 5-34. As a result, the selection of the temperature at which the 
cathode should be operated is not so straightforward. Sometimes a knee 
temperature is defined as shown in Figure 5-38. It is the intersection of linear 
extrapolations of the TL and FSCL lines that is used to determine the knee 
temperature. Then the operating temperature is specified to be a temperature 
increment, ÎT, above the knee. Unfortunately, this technique ignores the fact that 
there can be a great deal of variability in knee shapes for cathodes for a specific 
application. For example, for the cathode in Figure 5-38(a), FSCL operation would 
be possible for a time period of ~ÎT/2, whereas for the cathode in Figure 5-38(b), 
the onset of TL operation and reduced current would occur much sooner. 
 
Ideally, the operating temperature should be chosen so that end of life is 
determined when the cathode current in a tube has decreased by an amount that 
causes one of the operating parameters of the tube to fail to meet specification. In 
this case the âkneeâ temperature is the temperature that produces that cathode 
current. Then the operating temperature is specified to be a ÎT such as 50Â°C above 
that knee temperature.

Unfortunately, it is not as easy to determine end-of-life temperature in this 
manner as it would appear to be. This is because there are several factors that can 
cause irregularities in the shape of the roll-off curve in the FSCL region. Perhaps 
the most important factor is the thermal expansion characteristic of the cathode 
support structure. This causes the cathode-to-anode spacing and thus perveance to 
vary with temperature. This effect has to be compensated to find the true FSCL 
current. Other factors that complicate the determination of FSCL current include 
grid movement and scatter in measured data. 
 
5.4.2   Longo Life Prediction Model 
 
Another example of life prediction based on the depletion model is by Longo [22â
24]. He observed that the following simple relation described the emission from an 
impregnated cathode over a wide range of voltages and temperatures.

In this equation, JOP is the observed current density, JFSCL is the current density

and JTL is the current density that would be observed if the entire cathode was 
operating temperature limited. Shown in Figure 5-39 is a comparison of Longoâs 
equation with measured results. 
 
Vaughan observed that the knee of the roll-off curve described by Longoâs 
equation is much broader than that found for most cathodes. Vaughan proposed

Figure 5-39    Empirical relations for emission current. (Adapted from: R. T. Longo, 
Technical Digest, 1978 IEDM. Â© 1978 IEEE.) 
 
 
Longo used his relation to predict emission current density as a function of 
time by assuming that the work function in JTL (the Richardson-Dushman current) 
varies with time. The time dependence of work function is assumed to result from 
the variation with time of the fraction of the cathode surface that is covered by 
barium and by how much barium is on the covered surface. Surface coverage is 
determined by considering losses by evaporation and increases due to the 
evolution of material in the porous tungsten and the migration of this material to 
the surface by gas flow under conditions known as Knudsen flow. 
 
To use the prediction model for an M-type cathode, Longo took into account 
the diffusion of tungsten into the osmium coating and the resulting variation with 
time of the base metal work function and of the minimum cathode work function. 
He calibrated his model against the results of accelerated life tests as shown in 
Figure 5-40(a) and then used the model to predict the operating lifetime at normal 
operating temperatures as shown in Figure 5-40(b). In this figure, J(0) is the initial 
cathode current density and J(t) is the current density at a later time. Note that 
lifetimes over 100,000 hours are predicted with only small decreases in emission 
current. 
 
Since the first use of cathodes many decades ago, there has been a continuing 
requirement for increased emission capability along with long life. At present, for 
microwave tubes, these requirements are driven primarily by millimeter-wave 
tubes where small, high-current density cathodes are required for acceptable beam 
formation. There are also requirements for high-current density cathodes for 
technologies other than microwave tubes. One of these is for free electron lasers 
where a high-current density cathode (commonly referred to as a high brightness 
cathode) is needed to help limit the divergence of the beam generated by the 
electron gun.

There is a practical limit to the current density that can be drawn from a 
cathode, regardless of its emission capability. This limit results from the electrical 
breakdown characteristics of vacuum. For a 1-cm gap with a uniform field, the 
breakdown field is about 105 V/cm, so breakdown across the 1-cm gap would be 
expected for a voltage of about 100 kV. For a gap with hot electrodes (such as a 
thermionically emitting cathode) and filled with a high electron density, the 
breakdown voltage would be below 100 kV. 
 
For a planar SCL diode with an anode-cathode separation of 1 cm, a voltage 
of about 120 kV is required for a current density of 100 A/cm2. While the average 
field would be 120 kV/cm, the field at the SCL cathode would be zero and at the 
anode would be above the average field. Even if breakdown did not occur within 
the current flow region, it is probable that it would occur between the focus 
electrode and the anode where the spacing would be less than 1 cm. Thus, it 
appears that the practical upper limit to emission current densities is less than 100 
A/cm2. Higher-current densities are possible at very short pulse lengths because 
the breakdown field strength increases as pulse length becomes shorter. 
 
By optimizing the alloy composition on coated cathodes, Varian (now CPI) 
has been able to demonstrate emission densities of over 100 A/cm2 [28]. The 
Miram curves in Figure 5-41 show this emission capability and also show that the 
cathode was well behaved up to the highest temperatures and currents tested. 
 
Thomas et al. used barium depletion calculations to predict cathode life at 
high emission densities [2]. The criterion used for end of life was when the 
temperature limited emission dropped to half the initial level. Evaporation rate 
data for B-type cathodes was used to predict life as a function of temperature for 
each cathode type. Thomas et al. noted that the approximation is crude because of 
differences in impregnant composition, pore structure, and surface composition, 
all of which affect the net rate of evaporation. Still, a B-type cathode tested at 
LLNL and an M type tested at NRL, both at about 40 A/cm2, are in reasonable 

Thermionic Cathodes 
 
79 
agreement with predicted life. Thus, the results as shown in Figure 5-42 appear to 
be valid within a factor of 2 or 3 uncertainty. 
 
The life of the scandate cathode was also assumed to be limited by barium 
depletion. Thomas et al. noted that, at the time the paper was written, it was not 
clear what other mechanisms may limit the life of this cathode. Also, for all of the 
cathodes shown in Figure 5-42, it is often found that a higher temperature than 
expected (with resulting shortened life) is required to maintain emission because 
of the effects of poisoning gases.

5.5   DISPENSER CATHODE SURFACE PHYSICS 
 
The basic theory of thermionic emission discussed at the beginning of this chapter 
has been well established and understood for several decades. What has not been 
well understood until recently has been the work functions of surfaces with 
adsorbed atoms of various materials. As a result, cathodes have historically been 
developed more by trying various combinations of materials and techniques, rather 
than by design based on a thorough knowledge of surface physics. Fortunately, 
however, the modern state of cathode theories is significantly advanced from that 
given by Pierce in 1946 [1].

It is clear that as far as science goes, the state of the oxide coated cathode 
is confused indeed. Not only does theory fail to help us make good 
cathodes; it seems not to fit all the evidence. Maybe cathodes work 
sometimes one way and sometimes another, which isnât as ridiculous as it 
may sound. At any rate, while some physicists are uninterested and others 
confused, cathode making continues to be an art practiced, it seems, by 
artists with a good deal of witch doctor in their make-up. When 
something goes wrong, this or that demon is exorcised, and eventually 
things go right again. And, unlikely as it seems, cathodes continue to 
improve. 
 
 
While it is not yet possible in theory to design a new type of cathode having a 
predetermined emission density, operating temperature, and life, present cathode 
theories do explain very well how most dispenser cathodes operate. The following 
section contains an overview of the present theories of dispenser cathode 
operation. 
 
In the fundamental theory of thermionic emission, an energy level diagram for 
electrons in and near the metal surface, like that shown in Figure 5-43(a), was 
used. In dispenser cathodes, the emitting surface is far more complex than that 
shown in Figure 5-43(a). This is because of the diffusion of barium, oxygen, and 
perhaps other elements to the surface of the cathode. For the B-type cathode, for 
example, measurements show that the surface consists of monolayers of barium 
and oxygen on the tungsten base as indicated in Figure 5-43(b). The layers of 
barium and oxygen are each approximately a monolayer thick. The atoms in these 
layers are charged. The barium atoms have lost an electronic charge and are 

Thermionic Cathodes 
 
81 
positively charged. The oxygen atoms have acquired an electronic charge and are 
negatively charged. Thus, the positive barium atoms and negative oxygen atoms, 
along with negative image charges on the surface of the metal (not indicated in 
Figure 5-43(b)), form electric dipoles. These dipoles affect the potential 
distribution at the surface of the metal, as indicated by the curved potential profile 
followed by a question mark. Thus, the work function that electrons must 
overcome to be emitted is changed.

The positive charge of the barium atoms also results in electrostatic forces that 
attract the atoms to the surface of the metal. This causes the rate of evaporation of 
the barium atoms from the tungsten surface to be far below (by over an order of 
magnitude) the rate of evaporation of barium atoms from a barium surface. 
 
Before attempting to explain the effect of two (or more) layers of charged 
atoms of different elements on the work function of a surface, it is helpful to 
consider a single layer of atoms of one element. Following the work of Zalm and 
van Stratum [29], who were early developers of the M-type cathode, consider 
again the energy level diagram for a metal surface in Figure 5-44(a). With no 
foreign atoms near the surface, the energy levels are as previously discussed. If a 
small number (far fewer than required to form a monolayer) of atoms that can 
easily give up electrons (have a low ionization potential) are brought into the 
electric field near the surface of the metal, it is probable that some of the atoms 
will become ionized and give up electrons to the metal surface (see Figure 
5-44(b)). The presence of the resulting positive charge on the surface of the metal 
produces a reduction, ÎeÏ, in the work function, which, in turn, increases the 
probability of electron emission. The influence of the positive ions near the surface 
of the metal is similar to that of a microscopic grid at a positive potential. Such a 
grid would reduce the potential barrier at the surface of the metal and permit 
increased electron emission.

As additional atoms are brought near the surface, some become ionized and 
further reduce the work function (Figure 5-44(c)). For small numbers of atoms 
(much fewer than required for a monolayer), the amount by which the work 
function is reduced, ÎeÏ, increases linearly with the density of atoms on the metal 
surface.

surface, (b) a few foreign ions on the  surface, and (c) many foreign ions on the surface. 
 
 
As more atoms are brought near the surface, and more ions are formed, two 
primary effects reduce the rate of ion formation: 
 
 
1. The reduction in electric field near the surface that the ions produce 
results in a reduced probability of ionization. Eventually, the field is 
reduced enough that the probability of ionization approaches zero. The 
addition of more atoms will not produce additional reductions in the work 
function. 
 
2. As the number of ions increases, the distance between ions decreases. As 
this distance decreases, the repulsion forces between ions increases, and 
this causes more ions to be ejected from the metal surface. 
 
As still more atoms are brought near the surface, and the film thickness grows to 
over a monolayer, the work function gradually changes to that of the atoms on the 
surface. 
 
Using the concepts outlined in the preceding discussion, it is possible to 
understand the reasoning that led Zalm and van Stratum to the use of osmium and 
other high work function metals in cathodes. Consider two metals, one having a 
higher work function than the other. For example, consider osmium with a work 
function of about 5.4 eV and tungsten with a work function of about 4.6 eV. The 
energy level diagram in Figure 5-45 indicates why, with an adsorbed layer of ions, 
Zalm and van Stratum expected the work function for osmium to be lower than for 
tungsten. In each case, as more atoms are brought near the surface, ionization will 

Thermionic Cathodes 
 
83 
occur until the electric field has dropped to the point where the probability of 
ionization approaches zero (Pi â 0). This field will be approximately the same for 
the two metals. Because the work function for osmium is higher than for tungsten, 
the field at the surface is higher, and more ions can be produced than for tungsten, 
so the resulting reduction in work function for osmium is higher than for tungsten. 
In fact, the reduction for osmium is high enough that the overall work function of 
the metal plus adsorbed ion layer is lower than for tungsten. This results in a 
higher electron emission from osmium (with an adsorbed layer) than for tungsten.

The explanation given previously for the improved performance of an osmium 
cathode fails when some other metals are considered. For example, as indicated in 
Figure 5-46, the work function for platinum (which is a 5d transition metal in the 
same family as osmium) is comparable to that of osmium. However, the emission 
of a platinum coated cathode is significantly below that of osmium and is even 
below that of tungsten. As another example, the emission capability of a cathode 
coated with a tungsten-osmium alloy is superior to that of an osmium-coated 
cathode even though the work function of the tungsten-osmium alloy is below that 
of osmium. 
 
To understand the differences in performance between cathodes coated with a 
tungsten-osmium alloy, osmium, or platinum, it is necessary to examine the 
atomic structure of the metal cathode surface and its relation to adsorbed oxygen 
and barium atoms. The work of MÃ¼ller [30â32] has led to calculations of work 
functions for dispenser cathodes that are in excellent agreement with experimental 
results. 
 
In MÃ¼llerâs work, a microscopic portion of the surface of a cathode is 
modeled as a cluster of atoms. The models are chosen on the basis of crystal 
structures found on actual cathodes. An example is shown in Figure 5-47. Here, 
the B-type cathode is modeled as a cluster consisting of 19 tungsten atoms in a

body-centered cubic configuration and three groups of BaO molecules. The 
tungsten substrate in an actual B-type cathode is polycrystalline with many crystal 
faces present. The (100) orientation was chosen because of its simple structure. 
The clusters used for modeling the osmium and osmium-tungsten alloy substrates 
represented the hexagonal-close-packed lattice. For platinum, the face-centered 
cubic lattice was used.

The calculations were performed using large computer codes capable of 
analyzing the interactions between the relatively large numbers of atoms in the 
clusters. Calculated properties included electronic energies, densities of states, 
electron densities, charge distributions, surface electric dipoles, and barium 
binding energies on different substrates. 
 
Only the work function change that occurs with the sorption of barium and 
oxygen on the metal surface is obtained from the calculated properties. Thus, the 
minimum work functions depend critically on the bare-metal work functions of the 
various crystal faces considered. Because accurate values of the bare surface work 
functions are not known in most cases, some assumptions and approximations had 
to be made. In addition, empirical temperature dependencies of polycrystalline 
work functions for pure metals were used to estimate work functions at 1,200K. 
The initial bare-metal work functions affect the results by their magnitude and 
temperature dependence. A high value leads to a large charge transfer from barium 
to oxygen and the metal substrate. Alloying with W, in general, reduces the work 
functions for Re, Os, Ir, and Pt.

The work-function change that is induced by the sorption of BaO is found to 
be the largest for the hexagonal structures (Os, Ir, Os-W). The larger change more 
than offsets the initially higher bare-metal work functions of the alloy substrates 
and, as shown in Figure 5-48, leads to work functions that are up to 0.2 eV lower 
than for BaO on tungsten. 
 
The calculated barium binding energies for high surface coverages are 5.4 eV 
for BaO/W and ~6.0 eV for the alloy substrates. This increase of 0.6 eV is in 
excellent agreement with the observed increase in the energy of desorption for Ba 
from B- and M-type cathodes. This, along with a reduced operating temperature 
for a given emission current, is the reason for the long life of the M-type cathode. 
For BaO on platinum, the calculated binding energy drops to 3.6 eV. Thus, barium 
evaporates at a higher rate from platinum than from the other metals considered, 
and the resulting reduced coverage of the surface leads to a higher minimum work 
function. 
 
 
5.6   HEATERS 
 
5.6.1   Conventional Heater Assemblies [33] 
 
Typical oxide coated cathodes operate near 850Â°C and B-type cathodes operate 
near 1,100Â°C. To raise a cathode to this temperature, the heater must be very hot. 
The materials of choice for heaters are pure tungsten or tungsten with a small 
amount of rhenium added. The rhenium makes the tungsten easier to work. 
 
After being formed, the heaters are coated with an insulating layer 0.002â
0.003 inch thick of aluminum oxide. The oxide can be applied by spraying or by 
cataphoretic coating (an electrolytic process). The aluminum oxide insulation is 
sintered at high temperature to drive off organic binders and to form a hard, scuff-
resistant coating.

Heaters for oxide-coated cathodes generally operate at a temperature near 
1,100Â°C. This is not excessive for long life in tungsten or tungsten-rhenium 
heaters. Oxide cathode heaters are generally mounted in a fairly simple cathode 
structure with no special steps taken to improve the transfer of heat from the heater 
to the cathode. Two typical structures are shown in Figure 5-49.

One side of the heater is often connected to the cathode so that no large 
voltage difference exists between the cathode and any part of the heater. The 
aluminum oxide insulation on the heater is thin and will not withstand much 
voltage without breakdown. 
 
Heaters for B-type dispenser cathodes present a more severe problem because 
of the 1,100â1,150Â°C operating temperature of the cathode. The usual solution is 
to embed the heater in an aluminum oxide pellet at the back of the cathode as 
shown in Figure 5-50. Heat transfer between the heater and the cathode is much 
improved by this embedding or potting, so the heater operating temperature needs 

Thermionic Cathodes 
 
87 
to be only 150â200Â°C higher than the cathode. Also, the potting gives the heater 
mechanical support, making it resistant to damage from vibration and shock. The 
heater potting material is added as a powder, possibly compacted under pressure 
and then sintered at high temperature. 
 
Potted heaters have one disadvantage. The extra mass of the potting material 
increases the warm-up time over an unpotted version in a similar cathode. In most 
applications this warm-up time penalty (typically 2â3 minutes) is accepted as the 
price for improving heater reliability. Some applications, in missiles, for example, 
require fast warm-up. (Fast warm-up heaters are discussed in the following 
section.) Fortunately, such applications do not require long life, so the heater can 
be designed for low mass and high temperature operation.

Dispenser cathodes require special steps to conserve heater power. Heat 
shields are used extensively to minimize radiation losses to the side and back. 
Support members are made with as thin a cross section as possible to minimize 
conduction losses. Finally, considerable care must be taken by the manufacturer to 
ensure consistency in the heater potting operation. Variations in contact between 
the heater, the potting material and the cathode can lead to dangerous heater âhot 
spotsâ and cathode âcold spots.â 
 
Heaters can be operated from either ac or dc supplies. When an ac supply is 
used, the heater may cause âhumâ to appear as modulation of the signal. The 
source of this hum is often magnetic flux generated by the heater current. This flux 
extends to the cathode surface and perturbs the trajectories of electrons leaving the 
cathode. The toroidal heater on the right in Figure 5-50 is designed to minimize 
the generation of stray magnetic flux. The perturbation of the beam in a tube by 
magnetic flux from the cathode is discussed further in the following section. 
 
The dc heater supplies require extra circuitry, but they are sometimes used. A 
dc heater will eliminate hum, but stray magnetic flux from the heater can still 
perturb the beam emerging from the gun and cause increased interception current. 
The rectifier circuitry for a dc heater supply adapts easily to voltage regulation, 
which is of value when ac line voltage variations are excessive.

When a dc supply is used, the polarity of the supply can be important. If one 
side of the heater is connected to the cathode, that side should go to the positive 
side of the heater supply. The heater is then negative with respect to the cathode. 
This precaution is taken to avoid emission current from the back of the cathode to 
the heater. If the heater were positive with respect to the cathode, it would attract 
any electrons unintentionally emitted from the back of the cathode. The voltage 
and current involved are small, but over a long period of time such a current can 
damage the heater. 
 
5.6.2   Fast Warm-Up Heaters 
 
Fast warm-up heaters are needed for cathodes in expendable microwave tubes for 
missiles and may be needed for some space defense applications. Full emission is 
required from these cathodes within a few seconds after heater power is applied. 
This emission requirement must be met even though the cathodes may have been 
dormant for years prior to turn on. Also, most tubes with this fast turn-on 
requirement must meet severe shock and vibration specifications. 
 
The problems of rapid reactivation of a cathode after storage were discussed 
in detail by Haas et al. [34]. The factors involved include cathode type, surface 
composition, pore spacing, Ba impregnant concentration, Ba-O bonding, exposure 
to poisoning gases, and heating time and temperature. Haas et al. pointed out that 
it is the elimination of the poisoning products of ambient gases from the surface 
along with the arrival of new Ba surface atoms via the impregnant diffusing out of 
the pores that constitutes the reactivation process of the cathode surface. Some 
turn-on tests indicate that essentially no delay occurs. This could have been due to 
temperature overshoot as the cathode is very quickly brought to the operating 
temperature or to the passivating effect of other gases such as hydrogen. Other 
tests have correlated turn-on delays with measured pressures of oxidizing gases. 
 
Shown in Figure 5-51 are the temperature characteristics of some fast warm-
up heater-cathode assemblies [28]. The cathode diameter in each case was 0.2 inch 
(0.79 mm). In all cases, the fast warm-up times were achieved by using low 
thermal mass components. The 3-second design used an integral tungsten-3% 
rhenium heater cataphoretically coated with alumina. A voltage surge as high as 
twice the normal operating voltage was used. 
 
The bombarder-type assembly, which is shown in Figure 5-52, achieved a 
warm-up time of 1 second [35]. The heater is made of thoriated tungsten and 
designed to be heated to about 1,700Â°C in a fraction of a second by a large 
overvoltage. At that temperature the heater is also an emitter. Several hundred 
volts are applied between the heater and the cathode. Bombardment of the back of 
the cathode by electrons from the heater raises the cathode to the operating 
temperature.

Cattelino et al. described fast warm-up heaters for large diameter cathodes 
[36]. Anisotropic pyrolytic graphite deposited onto anisotropic boron nitride is 
used to fabricate heater wafers. Both planar and spherical heaters can be made. 
Warm-up times of 1 to 2 seconds for 4â6.4-mm-diameter cathodes and less than 
20 seconds for 60-mm-diameter cathodes have been demonstrated. 
 
5.6.3   Heater Testing 
 
By examining heater current and voltage, it is possible to determine if a heater is 
operating properly and, usually, if the cathode is at or near the proper operating 
temperature. It is important to realize that heater resistance varies rapidly with 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons

heater temperature. For the tungsten-3% rhenium wire often used for heaters, 
resistance increases by a factor of 6 as the wire is heated from room temperature to 
approximately 1,550Â°C. Thus, a plot of heater current versus heater resistance, as 
shown in Figure 5-53, can reveal malfunctions of the heater assembly. 
 
To provide meaningful information, the region of acceptance must be 
determined for a particular class of heater assemblies that are known to operate at 
the desired temperature. Then Figure 5-53 becomes the benchmark against which 
other heater assemblies can be compared. Excessive heater current implies that the 
heater assembly is at a lower temperature than it should be (for that current, the 
heater resistance is too low so the temperature is too low). Possible problems are 
that the tube is gassy (gas cools the heater) or that a heat shield is touching the 
heater or cathode assembly and carrying heat away. Operation below the region of 
acceptance indicates excessive heater wire temperature and possible heater failure.

5.6.4   Effect of Filament Magnetic Field 
 
Detailed measurements made on the electron beam from a magnetically shielded 
Pierce gun (discussed in the following chapters) illustrate the effect that an ac 
heater can have on a beam. The current used in the cathode heater was ac, and the 
beam voltage was pulsed on at various times during the heater current cycle [37]. 
 
When the heater current was zero, the electron beam cross section of Figure 
5-54 was obtained. When the heater current was at a maximum value, cross 
sections like that of Figure 5-55 were obtained. Under very specialized conditions, 
an image of the spiral-wound heater could be detected in the beam, as shown in 
Figure 5-56.

Electron Guns 
 
 
The electron guns for all linear-beam tubes have operating principles that are 
nearly the same. The only major differences are in size and operating voltage and 
current, which result from differences in power requirements. In this chapter, the 
operating principles of the electron guns used on nearly all linear-beam tubes are 
discussed. Most of these guns are designed using guidelines set forth by J. R. 
Pierce and are known as Pierce guns [1]. 
 
 
6.1   PIERCE GUNS 
 
The electron gun in a microwave tube is used to form the electrons from the 
cathode into a beam suitable for interaction with a microwave circuit. Electron gun 
designers must cope with the following two basic problems: 
 
 
1. Electrostatic repulsion forces between electrons tend to cause the beam to 
diverge. 
 
2. The current density required in the electron beam is normally far greater 
than the emission density that the cathode can supply with an acceptable 
life expectancy. 
 
 
The solution to these problems, described by Pierce, is summarized in Figure 
6-1. It is assumed that there is no magnetic field in the gun. Thermal velocities of 
electrons are ignored and laminar electron flow is assumed. The gun is divided 
into three regions. In the first region, assuming that a beam with a circular cross 
section is desired, the shape of the cathode disk (referred to as the cathode button) 
is spherical. (This may not be the optimum shape as pointed out by Brewer [2].) 
The focus electrode is designed to produce equipotential surfaces in region 1 that 
are nearly spherical, with the same center of curvature as the cathode. As a result, 
electrons flow toward the center of curvature of the cathode.  
 
In region 2, because the anode must contain a hole to let the electron beam 
pass through, equipotential surfaces bow into the anode aperture. As a result, a 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
96 
divergent electrostatic lens exists that produces a defocusing action on the electron 
beam. 
 
Finally, in region 3, the electrons have escaped from the accelerating field of 
the cathode-to-anode regions and are drifting under the influence of space charge 
forces. Thus, the electrons in the beam follow universal beam-spread trajectories.

Dealing first with the repulsion force problem as electrons leave the cathode and 
move toward the anode, it is instructive to examine the problem of attempting to 
cause electrons to travel in parallel paths as they leave a cathode as indicated in 
Figure 6-2.

When no electrons are present, the equipotential profiles in a parallel-plane 
diode are parallel and spaced equal distances apart for equal voltage increments. 
This is shown by the dashed lines in Figure 6-3. When electrons are present, the 
equipotential profiles are deflected to the right as indicated by the solid lines. 
Electrons tend to move perpendicularly to the equipotential profiles, so the 
electron trajectories diverge as the electrons move away from the cathode. This is 
simply another way of saying that the electrons are pushing on each other, and this 
causes their trajectories to diverge. If an electrode arrangement could be devised 
that would straighten the equipotential profiles even though electron space charge 
forces are present, then the electrons would travel in parallel paths.

Intuitively, it can be seen that, if the electrodes adjacent to the cathode are 
tipped toward the anode, as indicated in Figure 6-4, then the equipotential profiles 
will be straightened. In the absence of electrons, the profiles curve toward the 
cathode. The electron charge causes them to move toward the anode.  
 
The mathematical solution that leads to a definition of the electrode 
configuration for parallel electron flow is similar to the solution for the problem of 
space charge limited flow discussed in Chapter 5. The main difference now is that 
the equations must be solved inside and outside the beam, and the solutions must 
match at the edge of the beam.

Pierce showed that planar electrodes at the potential of the cathode placed at 
an angle of 67.5Â° with respect to the edge of the beam, as shown in Figure 6-5 
(along with a curved electrode at the anode potential, Va), will cause parallel 
electron flow. These electrodes at 67.5Â° are called Pierce electrodes and the 67.5Â° 
angle is referred to as the Pierce angle. 
 
Figure 6-6 shows an electron gun containing 67.5Â° Pierce electrodes for 
producing parallel (rectilinear) electron flow. Note that grid wires are shown 
across the aperture in the positive electrode. This is to maintain the electrode 
potential within the beam and, thus, prevent divergence of the beam after it passes 
through the positive electrode. Beam divergence caused by an anode aperture will 
be discussed next. 
 
6.1.2   Focus Electrodes for Convergent Flow  
 
The current density required in the electron beam in a microwave tube is normally 
far greater than the emission density capability of the cathode. As a result, it is 
necessary to use a cathode having a relatively large area and then compress the 
flow of electrons as the beam is formed. The starting point in Pierceâs analysis is a 
spherical diode. The inner surface of the outer sphere is the cathode and the inner 
sphere is the anode. A conical section of the diode is used as shown in Figure 6-7. 
Space charge limited emission is assumed.

The problem with the conical diode is that space charge forces will cause the 
beam to diverge just as they did for the planar diode. Equipotential contours, 
which should be spherical in shape, are deflected by the electron space charge 
potential as indicated in Figure 6-10. To retain radial electron flow when the 
remainder of the sphere is removed, it is necessary, as was the case for rectilinear 
flow in a parallel plane diode, to use electrodes that cause the equipotential 
profiles to have the shape which they had in the absence of the electrons (spherical 
in this case). 
 
Conceptually, as for the planar diode, it can be seen that, by tipping the 
electrodes adjacent to the cathode forward, the equipotential contours can be made 
more nearly spherical. In fact, as indicated in Figure 6-11(a), close to the edge of 
the cathode, electron flow appears to originate from a planar portion of the cathode 
with electron flow perpendicular to that portion. Thus, an electrode placed at a 
67.5Â° angle with respect to the edge of the beam will have the desired effect on the 
equipotential profiles near the edge of the cathode. For small cone half angles 
(small Î¸), this effect extends to the center of the cathode so no further 
consideration of the shape of the focus electrode is necessary.

For large cone angles, as indicated in Figure 6-11(b), the potential profiles 
will still not be spherical. As a result, the electron trajectories, as the electrons 
leave the cathode region, will not be focused toward the center of curvature of the 
cathode. 
 
A more important problem may be that nonuniform emission from the 
cathode will occur. For high perveance guns in which the cathodes are large in 
diameter, this problem can be severe. Assume, for example, that the separation 

Electron Guns 
 
103 
between the cathode and one of the equipotentials near the cathode is twice as 
large at the cathode center as it is at the edge. Since the equipotential and the 
cathode are, in effect, a diode, the emission current density from the edge of the 
cathode will be four times that at the center. (Remember that current in a diode 
varies inversely with the square of cathode-anode spacing.) This will compound 
the focusing problem of the electron gun and will also shorten the cathode life 
because the entire cathode will have to be at a temperature high enough to provide 
the emission required at the outer edge. 
 
To correct these problems, the shape of the focusing electrode must be 
modified so that the equipotential profiles near the cathode surface become more 
nearly spherical. Researchers have experimented with many possible shapes, one 
of which is shown in Figure 6-11(c) [4]. In effect, the modified focus electrodes 
lift the equipotential profiles away from the edges of the cathode. There is little 
effect on the shapes of the profiles in the center region of the cathode because the 
electron space charge fields dominate in controlling the potentials there. 
 
6.1.3   Defocusing Effect of Anode Aperture 
 
To remove electrons from the conical diode, it is necessary to cut a hole in the 
anode. The resulting distortion of the equipotential profiles near the anode aperture 
is illustrated in Figure 6-12 [5]. Notice that, at a low perveance as in Figure 
6-12(a), the distortion of the profiles is limited to the region very close to the 
anode aperture. As perveance is increased, as in Figure 6-12(b, c), the size of the 
anode aperture increases and the separation between the anode and cathode 
decreases. At a perveance of 3Ã10â6 the distortion of the profiles extends to the 
cathode surface. As a result, the electron trajectories in the cathode-to-anode 
region are seriously perturbed and emission from the cathode is very nonuniform. 
 
In [5], Brewer described the modification of the focus electrode as shown in 
Figure 6-12(d) to reduce distortion of the equipotentials and improve electron 
focusing and cathode emission uniformity. The modified focus electrode has the 
same effect as that shown in Figure 6-11(c). That is, the equipotentials are lifted 
away from the regions near the edge of the cathode. Although focusing and 
emission uniformity are improved, perveance decreases because of the reduced 
electric field near the cathode edges. 
 
The distortion of the equipotential profiles near the anode aperture results in 
the formation of a divergent lens. This lens changes the focus of the electron flow 
to a point beyond the center of the sphere, as shown in Figure 6-13. 
 
The lens formed by the distorted equipotential profiles is nowhere near a 
perfect lens because it suffers from spherical aberration. As is shown in Figure 
6-14, this aberration results in a focal length that varies with the radial position in 
the lens. Notice that the trajectory of the electron that leaves the cathode at 
position 1 is focused to a point to the left of the trajectory of the electron that 
leaves the cathode at position 2.

Frost, Purl, and Johnson [6] found that the measured beam from a high 
perveance gun was larger in diameter and less uniform in current density than 
expected from theory. By modifying the spherical radius of the cathode, as shown 
in Figure 6-15, they were able to correct for the lens aberration. The resulting 
improvements in beam characteristics are shown in Figure 6-16. The beam-current 
profiles at the top left of the figure were obtained before the correction was made. 
Note the severe nonuniformity in current as a function of radial position in the 
beam.

After modifying the cathode radius, the profiles at the bottom left of Figure 
6-16 were obtained. Not only was the uniformity of the current improved, but the 
radius of the beam at the position of the beam minimum was also reduced. After 
an additional small change in the focus electrode voltage, the profile to the right 
was obtained. As indicated by the Ãs, the shape of this profile was very close to 
that predicted by theory (the theories of Pierce and of Cutler and Hines [7], who 
predicted thermal velocity effects).

Before leaving the subject of spherical aberration, it should be pointed out that 
Brewer proposed the use of a nonspherical cathode for compensating for the 
effects of the aberration [2]. His parabolic-shaped cathode is shown in Figure 
6-17.

6.1.4   Formation of Minimum Beam Diameter 
 
After the beam leaves the anode aperture and enters region 3 (see Figure 6-1), the 
axial electric field is nearly zero and the only forces on the electrons are those 
resulting from the space charge. As a result, the shape of the beam is defined by 
the universal beam spread curve, shown in Figure 6-18. From the analysis for this 
curve (Chapter 3), the minimum beam radius, bm, and the axial position of the 
minimum radius, zm, can be found as functions of the entrance conditions into 
region 3. It is essential to have accurate knowledge of these quantities to properly 
inject the beam into the magnetic focusing structure. 
 
It is important to realize that the values of bm and zm are very sensitive to 
Rc/Ra (the ratio of the cathode and anode radii of curvature). This is illustrated in 
Figure 6-19, where beam profiles are shown for values Rc/Ra of that differ by 25%. 
As Rc/Ra increases from 1.6 to 2.0, significant changes occur in both the minimum 
beam diameter and its axial position. As Rc/Ra increases to 2.5, the minimum beam 
diameter is again reduced by a significant amount. This figure clearly illustrates 
the importance of precisely locating the cathode with respect to the anode.

Vaughan described a simple technique for synthesizing the design of a Pierce 
gun [8]. A design example is given in [9]. The technique provides a way to quickly 
check the design of an electron gun to see if dimensions and parameters are 
reasonable.

6.1.5   Thermal Velocity Effects 
 
In this section we will consider the effects of the thermal velocities of electrons on 
the beam produced by an electron gun. It is assumed that the magnetic field is 
zero. The nature of electron emission from a thermionic cathode is discussed early 
in Chapter 5 and also in Chapter 23. The Maxwellian velocity distribution of the 
emitted electrons is of importance here.  
 
Consider a small spot on the cathode of an electron gun. Electrons are emitted 
in all directions, and the beamlet of electrons from the spot grows in diameter and 
the current density decreases as the beamlet is accelerated toward the anode. The 
current has a Maxwellian distribution with a normal deviation, Ï, as shown in 
Figure 6-20. 
 
Cutler and Hines [7] analyzed the effects of thermal velocities on electron 
flow in a Pierce gun. They define the normal deviation by

where Îr is the trajectory deviation of an electron with an initial transverse 
velocity at the cathode (dr/dt)c. For a 10-kV, 1-A, 0.1-cm radius beam from a 
cathode at 1,000Â°C with a radius of 1 cm, the value of Ï is ~0.01 cm.  
 
Cutler and Hines summed the currents in beamlets from the entire cathode 
surface to find an expression for the total current distribution in the beam leaving 
the gun. The result is shown in Figure 6-21. Here, r is the radial position in the 
beam, b is the nominal beam radius (the radius in the absence of thermal effects), 
and Jo is the current density in a beam having the nominal radius.

For Ï = 0.01 cm and a beam radius of 0.1 cm (b/Ï = 10), the curve on the right

When very small beams are required, thermal effects are severe. An example 
from Danielson et al. [10] is given in Figure 6-23. Ignoring thermal effects, the 
minimum beam radius was calculated to be less than 2Ã10â3 in. The experimental 
radius enclosing 95% of the beam current (r95) was over four times larger (about 
8Ã10â3 inch). The minimum r95 radius calculated with the Cutler-Hines theory 
agreed well with experiment, but the variation of the radius with distance was 
quite different.

Danielson et al. corrected the Cutler-Hines theory by including the correction 
to the Davisson-Calbick equation and by using the space charge field in the 
thermal beam rather than that in the nominal beam. The minimum radius that they 
predicted also agrees well with experiment, and the variation of radius with 
distance is closer to experiment than that predicted by Cutler and Hines. 
 
Before leaving the discussion of thermal velocities, it is important to consider 
the effect of beam convergence in the electron gun on the transverse velocity 
distribution of the electrons. Figure 6-24 shows the trajectories of several 
nonthermal electrons, which are convergent on point F. The trajectory of one 
thermal electron is shown crossing the trajectories of the nonthermal electrons. 
Electric fields are assumed to be negligible. It is clear that the angle that the 
trajectory of the thermal electron makes with the trajectories of the nonthermal 
electrons increases as the beam converges. Thus, the component of thermal-
electron velocity perpendicular to the nonthermal-electron trajectories increases as 
the beam converges.

That is, the transverse velocity increase is inversely proportional to the radius 
compression ratio. Thus, to limit the growth of transverse velocities in an electron 
gun, the amount by which the beam is compressed should be held to a minimum. 
A cathode with a high emission capability helps in this regard because, for a given 
beam size and current from a gun, the cathode can be smaller, so the radius 
compression ratio is smaller than for a cathode with a low emission capability. 
 
6.1.6   Effects of Patchy Emission and Cathode Roughness 
 
The thermal velocity effects on beam shape discussed in the previous section are 
frequently overshadowed by the relatively large transverse electron velocities 
produced by patchy emission and cathode roughness. The surface of a dispenser 
cathode is made up of grains of tungsten that have various crystalline orientations 
and that may have various work functions. Because the thickness of the space 
charge cloud at the cathode surface is comparable to the dimensions of the grains 
and the pores between grains, each grain emits independently of the others and the 
emission is said to be patchy. For those grains that are temperature limited, 
emission varies with grain work function and most of the emission comes from the 
grains with low work functions. 
 
There are at least two ways by which the patchy nature of emission produces 
transverse velocity components to electrons leaving the cathode. These are 
indicated in Figure 6-25(a, b). In Figure 6-25(a) we note that space charge forces 
within the beamlet emitted from a patch cause spreading of the beamlet. In Figure 
6-25(b) we show that equipotential surfaces near the cathode surface are rippled 
because of the varying space charge density near the patches. This produces a 
spreading of the beamlets.

As explained in Chapter 5, coated dispenser cathodes have a narrower 
distribution of work functions than uncoated cathodes, so patchy emission is less 
pronounced for coated than for uncoated cathodes. If the work function 
distribution of a cathode increases with time, then the effects of patchy emission 
become worse. This may cause the beam diameter to increase so that current 
intercepted by the circuit increases. 
 
If the surface of the cathode is rough, as indicated in Figure 6-25(c), then local 
transverse electric fields are present, which produce transverse electron velocities. 
A problem sometimes encountered with coated dispenser cathodes is that the 
coating may develop microscopic cracks and peel away from the tungsten matrix. 
Then a cathode that was originally very smooth can become rougher as it is 
operated. If this happens, transverse velocities increase, beam size increases, and 
interception current may increase. 
 
 
6.2   BEAM CONTROL TECHNIQUES 
 
In all applications of microwave tubes, beam current must be controlled. Usually, 
the beam current must be switched on and off. Sometimes, continuous control is 
required. The âbrute-forceâ way to control beam current is with the cathode-to-
anode voltage as indicated in Figure 6-26(a). A second anode (called a modulating 
anode) may be placed between the cathode and final anode for current control as 
shown in Figure 6-26(b). In some guns current can be controlled with the focus 
electrode as shown in Figure 6-26(c). Finally, in the majority of applications, one 
or more grids is placed near the cathode surface, as indicated in Figure 6-26(d), for 
current control. In this section these control techniques are discussed. The primary 
emphasis is on grid control because of its wide use in TWTs. 
 
6.2.1   Cathode Pulsing 
 
Conceptually, cathode pulsing is the simplest technique for switching a microwave 
tube on and off. In virtually all applications, the anode of the gun and the body of 
the tube are at ground potential. To turn the beam on, the cathode is pulsed 
negative. To turn the beam off, the cathode is pulsed back to ground potential. The 
primary problem with cathode pulsing is that the power supply (the power 
modulator) must switch all of the beam power so the power modulator must be 
large, heavy, and, usually, inefficient. 
 
6.2.2   Control Focus Electrodes 
 
If a large enough negative voltage is applied to the control electrode, the current 
can be reduced to zero. The voltage needed to cut off beam current can be reduced 
by placing an additional electrode in the center of the cathode (Figure 6-27).

The control focus electrodes can be used to turn on the beam by setting the 
voltage at or very close to the cathode potential. The beam is turned off by setting 
the voltage significantly below cathode potential. This system is not useful for the 
intermediate control of current because of the severe defocusing that occurs in the 
electron gun.

6.2.3   Modulating Anode 
 
In the modulating anode gun, the anode of the electron gun (the modulating anode) 
is separated from the body of the tube, a part of which is a second (final) anode. 
The configuration of a modulating anode gun is shown in Figure 6-28.

Although the voltage range over which the modulating anode must be varied 
to vary beam current is large, the power required to drive the modulating anode is 
small because the current intercepted by this anode is small. At intermediate 
voltage levels, perveance may be controlled with the modulating anode without 
severely affecting beam focusing. 
 
6.2.4   Grids 
 
Under normal operating conditions, the guns with modulating anodes and those 
with control electrodes operate as Pierce-designed guns. When grids are used, 
however, electron trajectories near the cathode are affected, and so beam focusing 
is degraded and beam dynamics are affected. Still, grid control is very widely used 
because of the small modulator size that it makes possible. 
 
Several types of grid structures are illustrated in Figure 6-29. The simplest 
structure has a single grid element. A computer simulation of electron flow in a 
Pierce gun containing a single grid operating at a voltage positive with respect to 
the cathode is shown in Figure 6-30. Thermal velocities are ignored here, and, 
because the grid is positive, electron flow is very laminar. The problem with a 
single grid that is positive with respect to the cathode is that the cathode current 
intercepted by the grid can be very high. In some cases as much as 15% or more of 

Electron Guns 
 
117 
the cathode current is intercepted. The results of the interception are excessive 
heating of the grid at high duty cycles and the need for a relatively powerful grid 
modulator.

Many grid structures contain a shadow grid between the control grid and the 
cathode surface. The shadow grid operates at or near cathode potential so that 
heating by intercepted current is small. The elements of the shadow grid are 
aligned with the elements of the control grid so that the control grid is shielded and 
intercepts very little current. Several shadow-grid structures are shown in Figure 
6-29. 
 
Grid control of current in electron tubes has been used since the invention of 
the vacuum tube. In 1960, Wolkstein discussed methods of grid placement and 
associated design considerations for convergent-flow Pierce guns [11]. The basic 
concept is to form the grid so that its shape is identical to that of an equipotential 
contour near the cathode surface (usually spherical). Then, if the grid is at the 
potential of that contour and intercepts negligible current, electron flow will not be 
disturbed. To interrupt the current flow, the grid voltage is switched negative with 
respect to the cathode. 
 
A simple relationship for grid voltage as a function of anode voltage and gun 
dimensions can be found by equating the current flow from the cathode to grid, Ic, 
to the current flow from grid to the anode, I (refer to Figure 6-31).

The current flow from the cathode to grid is given by the Child-Langmuir 
equation for parallel-plane diodes. The current flow from the grid to the anode is 
given by the Langmuir-Blodgett relation for spherical diodes. The result is in 
Figure 6-32 and is

Next, we will examine the configuration of the grid elements. Examples of 
control grids for Pierce guns are shown in Figure 6-33. The grid configuration on 
the left is often used in guns with intercepting grids and that on the right is used in 
shadow gridded guns.

To stop (cut off) electron flow from the cathode, as shown in Figure 6-34, a 
negative voltage (with respect to the cathode) is applied to the grid. In Figure 6-34, 
the dashed curves show the potential variation between the cathode and anode for 
the 10-kV, 1-A electron gun with the grid 100V above the cathode potential. The 
solid curves show the potential variation when the grid is sufficiently negative 
with respect to the cathode to cut off electron flow. Note in the expanded drawing 
of the grid region that two solid curves are shown. One is the potential variation 
through a grid wire and the other is the potential variation midway between grid 
wires. The net effect of these two potential variations must be that the potential 
near the cathode is zero or negative if current flow is to be prevented. 
 
To avoid electrical breakdown between the grid and the cathode, the grid 
voltage used for cutoff must not be excessive. The cutoff grid voltage is controlled 
largely by the spacing between grid wires. Clearly, for large spacings, the cutoff 
grid voltage must be large because of the strong tendency for the anode field to 
penetrate the regions between grid wires. Thus, for relatively small cutoff grid 
voltages (and low probability of grid-cathode breakdown), the grid wire spacing 
must be small. 
 
In addition to small grid wire spacing, the area of the grid wires (and, thus, the 
width of the grid wires) must be small compared with the cathode area if the 
current intercepted by the grid is to be small. The ratio of the grid area to the 
cathode area is the screening fraction, which is the fraction of the cathode current 
intercepted by the grid. Thus, it is clear that, for small interception, the screening 
fraction must be small. 
 
An example of grid dimensions was reported by True [12] for the control grid 
in a shadow gridded gun similar to that on the right in Figure 6-33. For a 9.6-kV 
gun with control grid voltages (with respect to the cathode) of 102V and â86V, dgc 
= 0.015 inch, effective grid wire spacing = 0.023 inch and grid wire width = 0.002 
inch.

At this point, we can start to appreciate the care that must be taken in 
designing and fabricating a gridded Pierce gun. Not only are dimensions small, but 
also proper grid-to-cathode spacing must be maintained as the cathode is heated to 
a temperature of 1,000Â°C or higher. The problem of maintaining spacings and 
alignments is even more critical in shadow gridded guns, which are discussed 
next. 
 
The main problem with a single grid is that the cathode current intercepted by 
it can be very high. To alleviate this problem, many gridded Pierce guns use a 
shadow grid between the control grid and the cathode. The shadow grid was 
invented by Drees [13], who described its configuration and operation as follows: 
âIn accordance with the present invention, the novel grid construction comprises a 
first control grid and a second grid spaced from and aligned with the first grid. The 
second grid is disposed between the control grid and the cathode. In this 
arrangement, with the second grid preferably being held at cathode potential, the 
second grid acts as a (shadow) grid in that it shadows electrons from the control 
grid so that they are not intercepted by the control grid.â 
 
The effects on electron trajectories of the shadow grid, its location, and its 
voltage are illustrated in Figure 6-35 [14]. Each of these plots shows computer- 
generated electron trajectories from a cathode for the region from midway between 
grid wires to the grid wires. In an ideal shadow gridded gun, both the shadow grid 
and the control grid would be at positions and voltages that coincide with the 
equipotential surfaces that exist in the absence of the grids. Thus, except for 
interception and the finite sizes of the grid wires, electron flow would not be 
disturbed. The plot in Figure 6-35(d) shows trajectories with grid voltages adjusted 
to approximate the ideal shadow gridded gun voltages.

For the standard shadow gridded gun (Figure 6-35(a)), the shadow grid is at 
cathode potential but is placed a short distance (usually a few thousandths of an 
inch) from the cathode surface. Thus, a lens action occurs near each wire of the 
shadow grid. This is evident from the bending of the equipotential surfaces near 
the shadow grid. As a result of the lens action, electron trajectories are severely 
distorted. 
 
When the shadow grid is attached to or placed on the cathode surface, as in 
Figure 6-35(b), the distortion of the trajectories is significantly reduced. 
Unfortunately, of course, the shadow grid must operate at the cathode temperature, 
which can cause difficulties with grid emission and grid alignment. 
 
An advantage of placing the shadow grid at cathode potential, as in Figure 
6-35(a, b), is that only one grid power supply is required. If a separate power 
supply for the shadow grid can be used, then, as shown in Figure 6-35(c, d), the 
beam laminarity of the contiguous shadow grid can be equaled as in Figure 6-35(c) 
or improved upon as in Figure 6-35(d). 
 
Shown in Figure 6-36 are plots of electron trajectories in a shadow-gridded 
gun with the standard shadow grid [15]. The beam radius containing 95% of the 
current, r95, is indicated by dots. If the trajectories outside the r95 radius are 
followed back to the cathode, it is seen that they are the trajectories of electrons 
originating close to the grid wires.

If we examine Figure 6-36, we note that the grid-to-cathode spacing is 
somewhat smaller near the edge of the cathode than near the center. This was also 
evident in Figure 6-30. The reason for the reduced spacing at the cathode edge is 
that the equipotentials were spaced that way. As a result, the electric field and the 
emission density at the edge of the cathode are somewhat larger than at the center.

To cut off current flow, the control grid is pulsed negative with respect to the 
cathode. The resulting voltage distribution in the region of the grids is shown in 
Figure 6-37. Here, the grid voltage was â160V and the inner most potential 
contour from grid wire to grid wire was at â10V, so the grid voltage was slightly 
below that required for cutoff.

We have noted that the electric field is somewhat higher at the edge of the 
cathode than at the center. Also, when grids like that shown on the right in Figure 
6-33 are used, the spacing between grid wires increases with increasing radius. 
Thus, for negative control grid voltages, the anode field has a greater tendency to 
penetrate the regions between grid wires near the edge of the cathode than near the 
center. This means that, as control grid voltage is made negative with respect to 
the cathode, the last part of the cathode to be cut off is that near the outer edge. To 
compensate for this effect, True and Laycock tapered the widths of the grid wires 
so that they increased in width near the cathode edge [16]. As a result, cutoff 
voltage was reduced by a factor of almost 2. 
 
As the control grid voltage is varied, cathode current varies as shown in 
Figure 6-38. In addition, the beam current intercepted (the body current), mostly 
by the RF structure, varies. This is because, as control grid voltage and cathode 
current are changed while cathode voltage remains fixed, the gun perveance 
changes and focusing conditions change. As a result, the entrance conditions of the 
beam from the gun into the magnetic focusing field change. This causes the beam 
shape and body current to vary.

A particularly disturbing aspect of the body current characteristic shown in 
Figure 6-38 is that body current tends to become maximum when grid voltage is 
zero. This means that if grid bias is lost (perhaps because of a power supply 
failure), the RF circuit may be damaged because of excess body current. To 

Electron Guns

prevent this damage, a beam shaver like that shown in Figure 6-39 is often placed 
between the gun and the RF circuit.

When the control grid is pulsed negative to cut off the beam current, complete 
cutoff may not occur if the grid is emitting electrons. The resulting small beam 
current can result in unwanted signal generation and interpulse noise. 
 
Grids are often fabricated from molybdenum. Because of its high work 
function, grid emission from the molybdenum is insignificant even at high grid 
temperatures. However, when barium and barium oxide vapors from the cathode 
collect on the molybdenum, the work function can decrease to the point where grid 
emission occurs. 
 
There are two obvious options for preventing grid emission: 
 
1. Keep the grid cool enough so that emission is negligible regardless of the 
work function. 
2. Keep the work function of the grid high enough so that emission will be 
negligible regardless of temperature. 
 
The problem of controlling grid emission is complicated by the fact that there is a 
very large temperature variation from the center of a grid to the outer edge. An 
example calculated for a 3-mil-thick grid with a spiderweb configuration like that 
in Figure 6-33 is shown in Figure 6-40. The temperature drop from the center of 
the grid to the outer edge is nearly 400Â°C. Clearly, there can be no problem with 
grid emission near the outer edge of the grid, but near the center, where the 
temperature approaches 800Â°C, emission can occur if the work function is low 
enough. 
 
A technique that is sometimes used in an attempt to keep the work function 
high is to coat the molybdenum with zirconium. Haas and Shih [17] reported that 
zirconium acts as a getter by reducing barium oxide molecules and absorbing the 
oxygen. The freed barium then immediately vaporizes from the zirconium surface 
so that the work function is not reduced.

Unfortunately, as the oxygen content of the zirconium increases, its 
effectiveness decreases and eventually excessive grid emission can occur. Green 
and Goeser [18] reported that a thin layer of tungsten deposited on the 
molybdenum prior to zirconium deposition serves to extend the life of the 
zirconium film. In fact, the zirconium/tungsten/molybdenum combination is found 
to outperform pure zirconium grids. The role of the tungsten layer is not known. 
 
The best way to prevent excessive control grid emission is to ensure that the 
temperature of the center of the grid is less than about 600Â°C. Then, even if the 
grid work function is as low as 2.2 eV (highly unlikely), emission will be 
negligible. To do this, the grid support must be properly cooled and the radial 
thermal conduction of the grid must be as high as possible. 
 
The fabrication of shadow grid structures is difficult, especially in 
high-frequency tubes, where dimensions are small. Alignment of the elements of 
the control and shadow grids is critical. Alignment must be maintained despite the 
fact that the shadow grid operates at a higher temperature than the control grid 
because it is closer to or perhaps in contact with the cathode. 
 
An example of the grid motions that occur as a cathode warms up is given in 
Figure 6-41. These results were computed using the thermal expansion 
characteristics of the grids and their support structures [19]. Note that, at one 
point, the shadow grid moved to within about 0.001 inch of the cathode surface. 
This small spacing exceeded the total tolerance on the position of the grid. Thus, 
the shadow grid could touch the cathode, which, in turn, could lead to deformation 
of the shadow grid [20]. The author of [19] stated that this phenomena had also 
been noticed experimentally and corrective action was undertaken.

In an effort to overcome the problems of maintaining proper grid spacings in 
shadow gridded guns, Miram et al. developed the bonded grid structure shown in 
Figure 6-42 [21â23]. The grid elements were pyrolytic graphite, and these were 
deposited on a thin boron nitride spacer. To suppress grid emission, the control 
grid was overcoated with a thin boron nitride film. Technical feasibility was 
demonstrated in a 2,000-hour life test in which grid leakage and emission were 
shown to be very small and stable. The bonded grid has not yet found application 
because boron nitride with the required characteristics is not available and the cost 
of establishing a facility to produce it is, at present, prohibitive. 
 
Very sophisticated grid structures have been developed for some microwave 
tube applications. In the example in Figure 6-43, two control grids are used along 
with a shadow grid. This grid structure was developed for a tube that could operate 
efficiently at two different power levels. This is referred to as dual-mode 
operation. The grid closest to the anode controls emission from the central part of 
the cathode. The next grid controls emission from the outer portion of the cathode. 
Thus, beam current and diameter can be switched to change the beam power level 
while maintaining constant beam voltage and proper focusing conditions.

In [24], True described a dual-mode structure using two grids rather than 
three. The grid farthest from the cathode is a control grid like that on the right in 
Figure 6-33. The grid next to the cathode is like a shadow grid except that the 
outer openings contain closely spaced wires. When this grid is pulsed positive with 
respect to the cathode (+36V in [24]), current flows from the entire cathode. When 
the grid is negative (â36V in [24]), the outer portion of the cathode is cut off and 
current flows only from the center portion. 
 
The use of a shadow grid makes it possible to reduce interception on the 
control grid to about 0.1% of the cathode current. Unfortunately, at high 
frequencies where gun dimensions are very small, the fabrication of shadow grid 
structures becomes very difficult. To facilitate gun construction, negative grids are 
often used. With these grids, only a single grid is required and there is no grid 
interception. The beam optics are comparable to a shadow gridded gun. The 
current-voltage characteristic of a negative grid is compared with a unigrid (see 
Figure 6-29) in Figure 6-44. 
 
6.2.5   Summary of Beam Control Electrode Characteristics 
 
Table 6.1 contains a summary of the more important characteristics of beam 
control electrodes [25]. Two amplification factors are given. The total 
amplification factor, Î¼, is the ratio of beam to control electrode voltage required 
for beam control. The cutoff amplification factor, Î¼c, is the ratio of beam voltage to 
the negative control electrode voltage (with respect to the cathode) required to 
reduce the beam current to zero.

As would be expected, the gridded guns have by far the highest amplification 
factors and the modulating anode gun has the lowest amplification factor. The 
capacitances of all of the control electrode structures to the surrounding electrodes 
are essentially the same. Capacitance is important, of course, in the design of the 
modulator that must be used to drive the control electrode structure. Finally, as 
would be expected, the interception of the intercepting grid structure is much 
higher than the other structures. Only the modulating anode gun has good focusing 
because the design of that gun is essentially the design of an ideal Pierce gun.

Electron Beams 
 
 
In Chapter 6, Pierce electron guns used in linear-beam tubes were discussed. In 
this chapter, the magnetic focusing of a beam from a Pierce gun is examined 
([1â3] are recommended for further reading). Before proceeding with the 
discussion of magnetically focused beams, it is important to point out that 
numerous electrostatic focusing techniques have been examined in the more than 
70 years that microwave tubes have been in existence. With the exception of very 
few special cases, only magnetic focusing is used currently. 
 
The primary problem in focusing, as illustrated in Figure 7-1, is that space 
charge forces are so high in the beams in microwave tubes that, without focusing 
forces, rapid divergence of a beam occurs. With constraining (focusing) forces, 
beam divergence can be prevented.

In linear-beam tubes, the focusing forces are provided by a magnetic field 
aligned with the axis of the electron beam. Often, a solenoid like that in Figure 7-2 
is used to generate the field. Before developing the equations of beam motion in a 
magnetic focusing field, it is of value to discuss qualitatively how magnetic 
focusing works.

7.1   OVERVIEW OF UNIFORM-FIELD FOCUSING 
 
To simplify the description of the focusing process, it is initially assumed that 
there is no magnetic flux through the cathode and that the beam first encounters 
magnetic flux lines as it enters the solenoid. It is also assumed that there are no 
transverse velocity components (from thermal or grid effects, nonuniform cathode 
emission, and so forth). Magnetic focusing of the beam is initiated as the electron 
beam crosses radially directed components of magnetic flux lines (illustrated in 
Figure 7-3).

Electron Beams 
 
135 
 
Consider, for example, an electron above the axis of the beam (and solenoid). 
That electron encounters a component of magnetic flux that is radially directed 
downward. The magnetic force on the electron is out of the paper (the cross 
product of the velocity, u, and the flux density, B, is into the paper and the force 
on an electron is in the reverse direction from the u Ã B product). 
 
Consider next an electron below the axis. That electron encounters a 
component of magnetic flux that is directed upward. The magnetic force on that 
electron is into the paper. 
 
When the magnetic forces on all electrons are considered, the net effect is that 
the electron beam starts rotating in the clockwise direction as it enters the field 
with the flux lines in the directions shown in Figure 7-3. If the directions of the 
flux lines were reversed, the direction of rotation of the beam would be 
counterclockwise. 
 
As the electron beam moves further into the magnetic field, it encounters 
stronger axial components of magnetic flux. Consider again an electron above the 
beam axis. As a result of crossing radial components of flux, this electron has a 
velocity component out of the paper. The cross product of that velocity component 
with the axial magnetic flux is a vector away from the axis so that the force on the 
electron is toward the axis. Similar considerations for other electrons show that 
they all experience a magnetic force toward the axis. Thus, it is the rotation of the 
beam (established as the beam crosses radially directed flux lines) interacting with 
the axial components of flux that produces the magnetic focusing force. As each 
electron in the beam is followed, it is found that a helical trajectory about the axis 
of the solenoid is traversed as indicated in Figure 7-4.

7.1.1   Brillouin Flow 
 
If the space charge forces (plus centrifugal forces resulting from beam rotation) 
tending to cause the beam to diverge are just balanced by equal and opposite 
magnetic forces tending to compress the beam, and if the electrons enter the 
magnetic field with no radial velocity components, then the beam diameter will 
remain constant as the beam rotates and moves through the magnetic field. 
 
For a beam with uniform charge density throughout and no magnetic flux

through the cathode, the magnetic flux level that produces a magnetic force that 
exactly balances the space charge and centrifugal forces is called the Brillouin flux 
level, commonly denoted by BB. The resulting electron motion in the form of a 
rotating beam with constant diameter is called Brillouin flow. The configuration of 
the electron gun and magnetic pole piece for launching Brillouin flow are shown 
in Figure 7-5.

When the beam exits from the magnetic field at the collector end of the tube, 
the sequence of interactions is just the opposite of that at the entrance of the beam 
into the field. That is, as the beam leaves the magnetic field, the radial 
compressive force disappears, rotation stops, and the beam expands under the 
influence of space charge forces as it enters the collector. 
 
Now, as we have said, for Brillouin flow, the beam must have a uniform 
charge density and must enter the magnetic field on axis with no radial electron 
motion and with a radius, bo, equal to the equilibrium radius, a (the radius at which 
space charge and centrifugal forces are balanced by magnetic forces). This 
situation is shown in Figure 7-6. 
 
7.1.2   Scalloping 
 
When the electron gun is shielded from magnetic flux, it is extremely difficult to 
achieve the perfectly balanced force condition that is required for Brillouin flow. 
For example, consider the case when the electron beam enters the magnetic field 
with a radius smaller than the equilibrium radius shown in Figure 7-7.

Figure 7-7   Beam dynamics resulting from the beam entrance into magnetic field at less 
than the equilibrium radius. 
 
 
At plane z1, where the beam enters the magnetic field, the space charge force 
is larger than the magnetic focusing force, so the beam starts to expand. When the 
beam reaches plane z2, the radial forces are equal, but the electrons are moving 
radially outward. As a result, the electrons overshoot the equilibrium radius. By 
the time the electrons have reached plane z3, the radial motion of the electrons has 
been stopped because the space charge and centrifugal forces have become smaller 
than the magnetic forces. In fact, this force imbalance causes the beam to become 
smaller again and, by plane z4, the electrons are again crossing the equilibrium 
radius. Because the electrons are moving radially inward at plane z4, they 
overshoot the equilibrium radius. By the time the beam reaches plane z5, the 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
138 
inward radial motion has been stopped because the space charge and centrifugal 
forces exceed the magnetic forces. 
 
In a uniform axial field, the beam radius at plane z5 is the same as it was at 
plane z1 and the entire process that took place between planes z1 and z5 starts over 
again. As a result, the beam radius continues to oscillate as the beam moves in the 
axial direction. This periodic variation of beam radius is referred to as scalloping. 
 
For the preceding consideration (electrons moving parallel to axis as the beam 
enters the magnetic field), it is possible to adjust the magnetic field level so that 
the beam radius is the equilibrium radius. Then scalloping can be eliminated. 
 
A similar situation occurs when a beam traveling parallel to the axis but 
having a radius larger that the equilibrium radius enters the magnetic focusing 
field. Then the beam scallops inward because the focusing forces are larger than 
the space charge and centrifugal forces. Again, it is possible to adjust the magnetic 
field level to eliminate scalloping. 
 
If the electron gun is at the wrong axial position so that the beam is either 
diverging or converging as it enters the magnetic field, then no adjustment of the 
magnetic field can be made to eliminate the resulting scalloping. 
 
At this point it is appropriate to comment on the beam behavior that occurs if 
the axis of the electron beam is not aligned with the axis of the magnetic field. 
This could happen if the electron gun was misaligned during tube fabrication. The 
gun axis could be either off center or tilted with respect to the axis of the tube. 
Other causes for misalignment include errors in cathode, grid, or control electrode 
positioning or nonuniformities in magnetic pole piece material. The result of beam 
misalignment is that the entire beam spirals about the magnetic field axis at the 
cyclotron frequency.  
 
Figure 7-8 contains a summary of the problems that could be encountered in 
attempting to form a Brillouin beam flowing parallel to the axis. These problems 
are: 
 
 
(a)  Flux density is too small. 
 
(b)  Flux density is too large. 
 
(c) Beam is converging at the entrance. 
 
(d) Beam is diverging at the entrance. 
 
(e)  Beam axis is offset from the magnetic field axis. 
 
(f)  Beam axis is tilted with respect to the magnetic field axis. 
 
 
Brillouin flow has the advantage that the magnetic field required is the lower 
than for any other focusing technique. The primary disadvantage is that the beam 
is extremely sensitive to misalignments and perturbations (such as those produced 
by RF modulation). The effect of a change in beam current, such as that resulting 
from RF bunching of electrons, is shown in Figure 7-9. Note that an increase in 
current of 50% results in an increase in beam diameter of over 40%.

We will show in this chapter that Brillouin flow can be nearly achieved under 
laboratory conditions. In practice, the magnetic focusing field that is used, even 
when the cathode is shielded, is greater than the Brillouin value. Reasons for this 
include transverse electron velocities (from thermal and other effects in the gun) 
and the increase in beam size that results from RF modulation.

7.1.3   Confined (Immersed) Flow 
 
In practice, the use of Brillouin focusing is avoided because of the high sensitivity 
of the beam to perturbations. Instead, as shown in Figure 7-10, the magnetic 
circuit providing the focusing field is purposely designed so that magnetic flux 
lines pass through the cathode. This makes possible the use of a much larger 
magnetic field than the Brillouin value for focusing the beam. In addition, this can 
be accomplished without causing scalloping of the beam. This type of focusing is 
referred to as confined flow or immersed flow focusing.

It is helpful, in understanding the effect of flux through the cathode, to assume 
that the electron trajectories follow the magnetic flux lines in the electron gun. 
Then the magnetic field has no effect on the electrons in the gun. It should be 
pointed out that electrons do, in fact, cross flux lines in the gun (as is indicated in 
Figure 7-10). The resulting behavior of the beam is essentially the same as it is if it 
is assumed that the electrons do not cross flux lines. 
 
As the electron beam leaves the gun and enters the main part of the focusing 
field, the increase in flux density must be sufficient to produce a focusing force 
that counterbalances the space charge and centrifugal forces. The focusing force 
results, just as it did for Brillouin focusing, from the interaction of the beam 
rotation with the axial magnetic field. In this case, however, the axial field is 

Electron Beams 
 
141 
larger than it was for Brillouin flow so the beam rotates more slowly than for the 
Brillouin case. Also, since the beam rotates more slowly, the centrifugal force is 
reduced and this further reduces the rotational rate required for equilibrium.  
 
Next, consider a perturbation to the beam that causes the electrons to move 
radially outward. This could result from electron bunching caused by the 
interaction of the electrons with an RF field. As the outward moving electrons 
cross flux lines of the very large confined flow focusing field (often two to three 
times the Brillouin value), the rate of rotation of the beam increases rapidly. The 
interaction of this increased rotation with the large focusing field produces a 
focusing force far larger than that which occurs with Brillouin focusing. As a 
result, the radial expansion of the beam is much less than for Brillouin focusing. 
 
The primary benefit of confined flow focusing is that beam control is 
significantly better than for Brillouin focusing. This is illustrated in Figure 7-11, 
which is like Figure 7-9 except that curves for field levels two times (m = 2) and 
three times (m = 3) the Brillouin value are shown. For an increase in beam current 
of 50%, the change in beam diameter is decreased from over 40% for Brillouin 
focusing to about 8% for m = 2 and less than 4% for m = 3. The primary 
disadvantage of confined flow focusing is that the magnet(s) must be larger and 
heavier than those for Brillouin focusing to produce the required field. Also, if 
electromagnets are used, the power and cooling requirements are larger than those 
for Brillouin flow.

7.2   UNIFORM-FIELD FOCUSING AND LAMINAR FLOW 
 
7.2.1   The Beam Equation 
 
In the electron beams to be analyzed, the fields are axially symmetric. The radial 
electric field, Er, is produced by the electron beam and the magnetic flux density, 
B, used to focus the beam is in the axial direction. It is assumed that the charge 
density, Ï, and the axial velocity, uo, are uniform in the radial direction (but not 
necessarily in the axial direction). From Chapter 4, the radial force equation, 
which will be used to find the motion of the electrons, is

Here it has been assumed that the electrons originate at the cathode at a position, 
rc, where the flux density is Bc. At a given axial position, it should be noted that, 
with the assumption of uniform charge density in the radial direction and an 
additional assumption that electron flow is laminar in the gun (electron trajectories 
do not cross), then rc/r is a constant. Thus, at any axial position, Î¸  is constant 
throughout the beam. 
 
Also, since the space charge force (and also the centrifugal force and the 
magnetic force) is proportional to radial position, the radial acceleration and radial 
motions of the electrons are proportional to r, so electron flow in the beam is 
laminar. 
 
The electric field was found using Gaussâs law in the universal beam spread 
analysis. At the beam boundary where r = b, the electric field, Er(b), is

It will be shown that this quantity is the equilibrium radius for a Brillouin beam. 
As would be expected, as B increases, the magnetic forces increase, so the 
equilibrium radius must decrease. As the current increases, the charge density in 
the beam increases so the space charge forces and equilibrium radius must 
increase. As velocity increases, the space charge density and the space charge 
forces decrease so the equilibrium radius must decrease. 
 
Using the equilibrium radius, the beam equation can be written as

The first term is proportional to the radial acceleration and, therefore, to the radial 
force on the electrons. When the quantity in square brackets is zero, the net radial 
force is zero. (This occurs because the space charge and centrifugal forces causing 
the beam to expand are equal and opposite to the magnetic focusing forces that 
compress the beam.) When the radial forces are zero, the beam is in equilibrium 
and there are no forces causing it to expand or contract. If this condition can be 
sustained, then the beam diameter remains constant and a cylindrical beam has 
been formed. This is normally the desired beam shape. If the radius at which the 
forces are zero (the equilibrium radius, be), then the quantity in square brackets is

This can be simplified by examining the relationship between B and Bc. The value 
of B can be expressed in terms of Bc and the Brillouin flux density by examining 
the force equation. At equilibrium, the radial acceleration is zero and thus, for

where Ac â bc

2 is the cross-sectional area of 
the equilibrium beam. The ratio Ac/Ae is referred to as the area compression ratio 
of the electron gun. This result is significant because Ac/Ae is often as high as 25 
or more so a flux density of only a few tens of gauss at the cathode surface has an 
effect equivalent to a Brillouin flux density of 500 to 1,000 gauss or more. 
 
As noted previously, it is often convenient to reference the actual flux density 
used for focusing, B, to the Brillouin value, BB, by the confinement factor m, 
which is defined by

7.2.2   Brillouin Flow

region, m = 1, so the configuration of the magnetic field at the entrance to the

First, let the electron beam enter the focusing structure at the equilibrium 
radius traveling parallel to the axis. Then at z = 0, b = a, and db/dz = 0, so C = 0. 
As a result, the beam radius remains constant as the beam travels through the 
magnetic focusing field. 
 
The magnetic flux density that produces a beam of constant radius when no 
magnetic flux links (passes through) the cathode is the Brillouin flux density, 
usually denoted by BB. The resulting beam is a Brillouin beam, and the resulting 
electron motion is Brillouin flow. The magnetic flux required for Brillouin flow is 
smaller than for any other magnetic focusing technique. The Brillouin flux density 
can be determined from the equilibrium radius and is:

Because the flux density is minimized, the size of the magnet structure (permanent 
magnet or solenoid) is minimized with Brillouin flow. The penalty for using 
Brillouin flow, as shown in the following discussion, is that the beam is very 
sensitive to misalignments, incorrect magnetic fields, RF drive, and so forth. 
 
If the magnetic flux density is changed so that it is less than the Brillouin 
value, that is, B < BB, then the value of the equilibrium radius, a, increases and so 
the beam diameter increases as the beam enters the focusing field. Subsequently, 
the beam diameter oscillates about the equilibrium diameter as shown in Figure 
7-13.

Ideally, each of the current profiles in Figure 7-16 should be rectangular. At 
least three factors prevented the current from rising abruptly from zero to a 
constant value at the edges of the beam profiles. One factor was the finite diameter 
(0.010 inch (0.25 mm)) of the aperture in the current probe used for current 
sampling. The second factor was the thermal velocities of the electrons, and the 
third factor was the patchiness and roughness of the oxide coated cathode. 
 
From data like that in Figure 7-16, the beam radius as functions of the axial 
position and the magnetic flux density were determined and are shown in Figure 
7-17. At the predicted Brillouin flux density of 285G, the variation in beam 
diameter was less than 2%. 
 
Brewer reported measurements on beams from several electron guns with a 
wide range of focusing conditions [6]. He observed translaminar streams of 
electrons that originated from aberrations in the gun but these constituted a small 
percentage of the current in the beam. He concluded: âThe close agreement 
between the experimental data and the laminar-flow theory would appear to 
indicate that the bulk of the beam is in a very nearly laminar-flow situation. This 
does not mean that no electrons cross other electron paths in the beam, since many 
anomalies have certainly been observed which could result from electron-
trajectory crossings. However, the author believes that most of the electrons in a 
well-formed beam do behave as in laminar flow for magnetic field values near the 
Brillouin-flow condition.â

7.2.3   Confined (Immersed) Flow 
 
When part of the magnetic flux used for focusing the beam passes through the 
cathode, the beam is said to be partially confined or confined (or sometimes 
partially immersed or immersed) and the behavior of the beam is quite different 
than that for Brillouin flow. First, the scalloping of the beam is reduced when the 
beam is expanding or contracting as it enters the focusing field. Second, when 
changes in beam conditions occur, such as bunching of the electrons by an RF 
field, the  resulting perturbations of the beam radius are reduced significantly. 
 
Using Buschâs theorem, it is possible to more clearly understand the details of 
confined flow focusing. For example, the rate of rotation of the beam,Î¸ , 
compared to the rate of rotation of the Brillouin focused beam, 
B
Î¸ , can be found to 
be

This relation is plotted in Figure 7-18. Note that, as m increases from unity (the 
Brillouin value) to the range of 2 to 3 commonly used for confined flow focusing, 
the rate of rotation of the beam drops by a factor of 4 to over 5 from the Brillouin 
value.

To more clearly understand why the beam rotates so slowly for reasonable 
values of m, consider Figure 7-19. When flux links the cathode, the total flux 
through the cathode surface is Ï bc
2 Bc. This is the same as the total flux through 
the area defined by radius g (shown in Figure 7-19), which is Ï g2 B. Note that 
when g = 0, there is no flux through the cathode. When g = b, the total flux 
through the cathode is the same as the total flux contained in the electron beam at 
position z. As a result,

Notice that, for reasonable values of m, g is very close to be. For example, for m = 
2, g = 0.93be. Thus, the flux that causes rotation of the beam is equivalent to that 
contained in the outer 7% of the beam. 
 
Because the beam rotates so slowly with confined flow focusing, the 
centrifugal force, which is equal to the space charge force for Brillouin focusing, 
almost vanishes. Nearly all of the focusing force produced by the slowly rotating 
beam in the strong focusing field is used to offset space charge forces.

It is of value to compare the beam dynamics for confined focusing to those for 
Brillouin focusing. First, assume that the beam enters the focusing field at the 
equilibrium radius but with a radial component of velocity. Then the resulting 
scallop amplitude, C, compared with the amplitude of the scallop on a Brillouin 
beam, CB, for the same entrance conditions (a = be), is [7]

This result is shown in Figure 7-20. Note that a significant decrease in scallop 
amplitude occurs as the flux density is increased. 
 
Next consider the effect on beam radius of a change in current in the beam. 
Here it will be assumed that the beam velocity remains constant. Current may 
change because of the use of a control electrode, such as a grid, in the electron gun 
to modulate the electron flow. Also, current changes in localized regions when the 
beam interacts with the RF field on a nearby circuit to produce bunching of the 
electrons.

The ratio, Î´/Î´B, is plotted in Figure 7-20 as a function of the confinement 
factor m. It is clear that the effect of confined flow on beam perturbations resulting 
from current changes is significant and that the use of confined flow is very 
desirable to reduce these perturbations. The penalty is that the increase in flux 
density required for confined flow necessitates an increase in the size of the 
magnets used and, if solenoid focusing is employed, an increase in solenoid 
power.  
 
In his paper on magnetically focused electron beams, Brewer clearly showed 
the confining effect of magnetic flux through the cathode [6]. As the cathode flux 
density was increased, beam scalloping decreased and variations in current density 
with distance were reduced. Brewer also noted that cathode flux prevents 
translaminar electrons from crossing or coming close to the beam axis, so cathode 
flux improves the laminarity of the beam.

7.3   UNIFORM-FIELD FOCUSING AND NONLAMINAR FLOW 
 
In the chapters on cathodes and guns, several mechanisms have been identified 
that produce transverse velocity components to electron trajectories: 
 
 
1. Thermal effects; 
 
2. Patchy emission; 
 
3. Cathode roughness; 
 
4. Filament magnetic field; 
 
5. Field distortion by grids; 
 
6. Gun aberrations. 
 
 
As a result of the transverse velocity components, electron trajectories cross and 
the electron flow is said to be nonlaminar. 
 
There is no single theory for treating all forms of nonlaminar flow. In fact, the 
only way for determining, with reasonable accuracy, electron behavior in 
nonlaminar flow is by tracing trajectories using numerical techniques. Results of 
this approach will be shown in a following section, which is concerned with PPM-
focused beams from gridded guns. 
 
Several theories exist for special cases of nonlaminar flow. One of the first 
was that by Pierce and Walker for the effects of thermal velocities on Brillouin 
flow [8]. This theory was based on the assumption of a Maxwellian distribution of 
charge density within the beam. The beam was assumed to be in thermal 
equilibrium with a temperature that was suggested to be the cathode temperature 
multiplied by the area compression ratio of the gun. Pierce and Walker computed 
the percentage of the beam current to be found outside the nominal Brillouin 
radius. 
 
Brewer compared his experimental beam profiles with the predictions of 
Pierce and Walker [8]. The temperature used was the cathode temperature 
multiplied by the area compression ratio of the gun. Brewer showed that this was 
reasonable by examining the radial spread of electrons passing through an aperture 
located on the axis of the beam. The observed temperature was within 20% of the 
calculated temperature. Brewerâs measurement of the current profile for the beam 
edge compared favorably with the Pierce and Walker theory near the nominal 
beam radius. At larger radii, there was a low current-density âtailâ on the current 
profile that was far from the prediction of the theory. This tail was thought to have 
resulted from the translaminar streams of electrons produced by gun aberrations.  
 
Gilmour et al. [4, 5] and Brewer [6] showed that beams focused for near 
Brillouin flow conditions do behave very nearly as predicted by laminar flow 
theory. However, Ashkin [9] and Harker [10] reported that electron flow in beams, 
which had been thought to be laminar, was actually very nonlaminar. Following 
the works of Ashkin and Harker, Herrmann presented an optical theory for thermal 
velocity effects that discarded the assumption of laminarity [11]. 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
154 
 
Herrmannâs theory treats beams as perfect optical systems. The thermal 
velocities of the electrons emitted in all directions by the cathode are assumed to 
have a Maxwellian distribution. Electron trajectories are assumed to obey the laws 
of geometrical optics of ideal optical systems. A comparison of electron 
trajectories in Herrmannâs optical model with those for a laminar flow model is 
shown in Figure 7-21. For laminar flow, as discussed earlier in this chapter, the 
electrons move side by side without ever crossing each otherâs paths. For 
imbalanced space charge and magnetic forces, the beam radius oscillates with a 
scallop wavelength, Î»s.

With the optical theory, electrons emitted from a point on the cathode focus 
periodically to form cathode images. As explained by Herrmann [11]: âOne finds 
along the axis a succession of cathode images alternating with crossovers which 
impart to the beam a distinct structure which depends primarily on the internal 
motion of the electrons rather than on the shape of a boundary electron, as is the 
case in laminar theory.â 
 
Amboss compared the predictions of Herrmann with measurements on highly 
convergent, low-perveance (0.015Ã10 â6) beams focused by a flux density over an 
order of magnitude above the Brillouin value [12]. As shown in Figure 7-22, he 
found excellent agreement with the predictions of the optical theory. In this figure, 
Î»I is the distance between cathode images (the first and second images are shown). 
Note that the current profile changes from rectangular to Gaussian in the crossover 
region between images.

The Amboss results show the validity of the optical theory under conditions 
far from normal beam focusing conditions. For fields closer to the Brillouin level, 
Brewer found that the behavior of the translaminar electrons, which were 
produced by gun aberrations, was similar to that predicted by optical theory. In 
Gilmourâs beam studies, the only evidence of optical-theory behavior was when an 
image of the heater for the cathode appeared in the electron beam. Magnetic flux 
lines generated by the heater current perturbed the flow of electrons from the 
cathode and, apparently, led to the optical behavior of the subsequent electron 
trajectories 
 
Other studies of nonlaminar beams include those of Kirstein [13, 14] and 
Hechtel [15]. Kirstein used essentially the same approach as Herrmann. Axially 
symmetric and two-dimensional strip beams were treated. Hechtel treated beams 
having a Gaussian current distribution in the radial direction at the exit from the 
gun. The reason for considering this type of beam is that, at millimeter-wave 
frequencies where beams are very small, thermal velocity effects in the gun result 
in a beam having a current distribution that is nearly Gaussian. Expressions are 
given for the magnetic field required to achieve various percentages of beam 
transmission through a tunnel. 
 
 
7.4   FOCUSING WITH PERMANENT MAGNETS 
 
7.4.1   Overview 
 
A permanent magnet that produces a unidirectional field can be used in place of a 
solenoid to focus an electron beam. This eliminates the requirement for a power 
supply and ensures that the magnetic focusing field is always present. 
Disadvantages are size and weight. Also, in some applications, a disadvantage is 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
156 
that it is not possible to adjust the magnetic field to optimized tube performance. 
 
As shown in Appendix C, the weight reduction of a periodic permanent 
magnet (PPM) focusing system, when compared with a solenoid or a 
unidirectional magnet, can be one to two orders of magnitude. A PPM focusing 
system is shown in Figure 7-23.

The basic principle of PPM focusing is straightforward. As a beam enters the 
field of a magnet section, the forces on the electrons act in exactly the same way 
as was described for Brillouin focusing. That is, the beam starts to rotate and the 
interaction of the rotational motion with the axial field produces a radial force that 
compresses the beam. 
 
As the beam leaves the magnet section, rotation stops, focusing forces vanish, 
and the beam expands under the influence of space charge forces. The beam then 
enters another magnet section with the field in the opposite direction from the 
previous one. Then the beam rotates in the opposite direction, but is focused just 
as it was in the previous section. 
 
The overall result, as the beam traverses the alternating field of the PPM 
structure, is that its rotation oscillates back and forth, producing alternating 
periods of magnetic focusing and beam expansion and beam ripple. The difference 
between beam ripple, which results from the periodicity of focusing, and beam 
scalloping, which is the oscillation of a beam that is not in equilibrium, is 
indicated in Figure 7-24.

7.4.2   Laminar Flow, No Cathode Flux 
 
While the qualitative explanation of PPM focusing is straightforward, the analysis 
is complex and not so straightforward. Still, much can be learned from an 
examination of the beam equation when PPM fields are used. In the analysis, it is 
assumed that the magnetic field is a function of axial position, z, only and that no 
radial variations occur. It can be shown that this assumption is realized along the 
axis when the magnetic field varies sinusoidally with distance. For the purposes of 
this analysis, it will be assumed that

That is, the rms value of the periodic field is the Brillouin field. As a result, 
the PPM focusing discussed here is similar to Brillouin focusing in that the space 
charge forces are balanced by the magnetic forces and no field is present at the 
cathode. 
 
Next, the stability of PPM focusing will be examined. The stability question is 
important because there are ranges of values of flux density, magnet period, L, 
beam current, and beam voltage for which the beam diverges so that no beam 
current is transmitted through the PPM structure. Following the works of Mendel

Solutions to this equation were originally obtained using an analog computer [16]. 
It was assumed that the electrons were injected into the magnetic field with no 
radial velocity at z = 0, which was where the magnetic field was a maximum. 
Typical beam envelope curves for three values of the magnetic field are shown in 
Figure 7-25. Both scalloping and ripple are present in Figure 7-25(a, c) when the 
magnetic field is not adjusted for optimum focusing.

Curves similar to those in Figure 7-25 were obtained by Mendel et al. for a 
wide range of values of Î² and from these curves the universal plot for optimum 
focusing given in Figure 7-26 was constructed. Note that optimum focusing occurs

When substitutions are made for rms flux density (BB), charge density, and 
velocity, this relation is seen to be that for the equilibrium radius for Brillouin 
flow. This is not surprising since, on average, the space charge forces are the same 
as for the Brillouin case and the rms field is the Brillouin field so the centrifugal 
and focusing forces are the same as for the Brillouin case. 
 
The minimum ripple for optimum focusing is also shown in Figure 7-26. For 
values of Î² below about 0.35, the ripple amplitude is reasonably small. As Î² 
increases above 0.35, the ripple amplitude becomes very large and, in fact, for Î² > 
0.66, the beam diverges. 
 
We can learn more about the onset of the unstable region by further 
examination of the equation for the normalized beam radius. The term containing 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons

Î² is the space charge term and represents a diverging force. If this term is 
neglected and the remainder of the equation diverges, then the solutions including 
space charge forces must diverge.

The equation for the normalized beam radius is a form of the Mathieu 
equation, which is characterized by solutions for Î± that are periodic in T for some 
ranges of Î± and unstable for other ranges of Î±. Figure 7-27 shows the ranges of Î± 
for which the solutions are unstable. Note that, as Î± increases from zero, the first

Using the equations for the space charge coefficient, the magnetic field 
coefficient, and the fact that the unstable region starts at Î± = 0.66, the relations 
between Ïp, ÏLp, and Ï at which the unstable region starts are

The reason for the first of these relations is straightforward. If the periodic 
impulses provided by the focusing field at frequency Ï are near synchronism with 
the natural frequency of oscillation of the electrons, Ïp, the beam diverges. The 
reason for the second relation can be understood by remembering that PPM 
magnets form a lens system that periodically focuses the electron beam as is 
indicated in Figure 7-28. The strength of each lens is proportional to B2 and, 
therefore, to ÏLp
2 and the focal length is inversely proportional to ÏLp
2. Thus, if the 
lenses are too strong or are too far apart as indicated qualitatively by analogy to 
optical lenses in Figure 7-29, the beam diverges. In Figure 7-29(a), the lens 
strength and separation are such that the focal length, f, is one half of the lens 
separation. The ray, which is analogous to an electron trajectory, remains focused 
throughout the lens system. In Figure 7-29(b), the focal length is much shorter 
than in Figure 7-29(a) but the ray remains focused. In Figure 7-29(c), the focal 
length has been reduced slightly compared with Figure 7-29(b) and the ray 
diverges as it travels through the lens system.

True [18] reported the use of the stopband voltage as a tool for determining 
the magnetic field and as a diagnostic tool. An example of the determination of the 
stopband voltage is shown in Figure 7-30. Beam transmission is plotted as a 
function of beam voltage with perveance held constant. True reported that the 
magnetic field strength measured using a gaussmeter was in excellent agreement 
with the field calculated from the stopband voltage. Uses reported by True for the 
measurement of stopband voltage are the following:

shunting, and magnetic entrance conditions);

7.4.3   Laminar Flow with Cathode Flux 
 
 
In the previous section we examined PPM focusing of beams from electron guns 
with cathodes that are shielded from magnetic flux. It is also possible to achieve 
the equivalent of confined flow focusing with PPM fields and with flux through 
the cathode. Several researchers, including Chang [19], Mendel [20], Harker [21], 
and Harmon [22], have treated periodic focusing with cathode flux.

Confined flow PPM focusing achieves many of the advantages of confined 
flow focusing with uniform fields. For example, resistance to ion and RF 
defocusing is increased and the control of beams from gridded guns is improved. 
A deficiency in the PPM case that is not present in uniform-field focusing is that 
the rotational energy of the beam increases as the beam becomes more confined. 
As a result, the energy in the axial motion of the beam and the efficiency decrease. 
 
The reason for the increase of rotational energy with the cathode magnetic 
field can be understood with the aid of Figure 7-31. Consider first the rotation of 
the beam within the first magnet. From Buschâs theorem, we know that the rate of 
rotation is determined by the change in flux density encountered by the beam as it 
enters the first magnet. However, with cathode flux as shown in Figure 7-31 in the 
opposite direction to that in the first magnet, the change in flux density is larger 
than it is with no flux through the cathode. Thus, the rate of rotation of the beam in 
the first magnet is larger than it is with no flux through the cathode. 
 
As an example of the effect of cathode flux, assume a cathode flux density of 
25 gauss, a peak flux density in the first magnet of 1,000 gauss, and an area 
convergence ratio of 20:1. Then the peak rate of beam rotation in the first magnet 
is

(7-46) 
As the beam moves on to the third magnet, rotation again reverses and the peak 
value of the rate of rotation is again proportional to 1,500 gauss. 
 
The ratio of magnetic focusing forces from magnet to magnet is equal to the 
ratio of rotation rates, which is 3. This large ratio of focusing forces is offset by an 
equally large ratio of centrifugal forces (the large rate of rotation in magnet 1 
produces a centrifugal force that is three times that in magnet 2). As long as the 
beam velocity remains constant, the ripple amplitude from magnet to magnet 
remains constant.  
 
It should be observed that, because there is more energy in rotation in magnet 
1 than in magnet 2, the axial velocity of the beam in magnet 1 is lower than in 
magnet 2. As a result, the beam density in magnet 1 is larger than in magnet 2 and 
this produces a fluctuation in the radius of the beam that is similar to beam 
scalloping.

Figure 7-31   Magnetic field configuration for confined flow PPM focusing. 
 
 
Figure 7-32 shows the variation of peak rotational beam energy with magnetic 
flux density and with microperveance (perveance Ã10 6) [23]. Note that, for 
reasonable values of confinement, a large fraction of the beam energy is in rotation 
for microperveances above ~0.5. As a result, efficiency is degraded. Thus, 
confined flow PPM focusing is limited to low-perveance designs. Hence, it is 
particularly suitable for millimeter-wave tubes for which perveance is usually 
limited by cathode loading considerations and in which beam interception 
problems are particularly critical. 
 
A primary reason for using confined flow focusing is to limit the expansion of 
the beam during RF operation. In [23], Ayers et al. presented beam expansion 
factors (the ratio of the maximum beam radius with RF drive to the dc radius) for 
0.45 and 0.036 microperveance TWTs. The results for 0.036 microperveance are 
shown in Figure 7-33. Notice that: 
 
 
1. Beam expansion is dramatically decreased as the magnetic field is 
increased. 
 
2. There is little change in beam expansion as Î»p/L is increased. 
 
3. The ripple decreases rapidly as Î»p/L is increased. Ripple is defined as

7.4.4   Nonlaminar Flow 
 
In the chapters on cathodes and guns, many sources of beam nonlaminarities were 
discussed. The most important were the grids in electron guns. Most PPM-focused 
TWTs use gridded electron guns and the nonlaminarities produced by these guns 
are usually far more significant than other nonlaminarities. To gain an appreciation 
for the nonlaminar nature of the beam from a gridded gun, consider Figure 7-34. 
This figure contains computer-generated electron trajectories for a PPM-focused 
beam from a shadow gridded gun [24]. The radial scale has been expanded to 10 
times the axial scale to help illustrate the apparently random nature of the electron 
trajectories.

The most definitive procedure that has been reported for dealing with PPM- 
focused beams and gridded guns is that by True [24â26]. In this section, we will 
describe the basic elements of Trueâs theory. There are basically three steps to 
Trueâs procedure: 
 
 
1. Most importantly, the transverse velocity content of the beam at its 
entrance into the magnetic focusing field is found. This is a measure of 
the transverse velocities of the electrons and is expressed in normalized 
form as 
 
 
 
r
o
v
= u
Ï
 
(7-48) 
 
 
where uo is the dc velocity of the beam. 
 
2. The transverse velocities, along with space charge forces, must be 
controlled by the magnetic focusing structure. In effect, True treated the 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
168 
transverse velocity content as an additional force (in addition to the space 
charge force) that must be focused. This is done by finding an effective 
microperveance, PÎ¼
+, for the beam (microperveance equals perveance 
multiplied by 106), which is the sum of the regular beam microperveance, 
PÎ¼, and a scattering microperveance, PÎ¼s, that results from the transverse 
velocity content. That is, 
 
 
 
s
P  = P  + P
Î¼
Î¼

(7-49) 
 
3. In the absence of magnetic flux through the cathode, the field level 
required to focus an ideal beam is the Brillouin field, and this is 
proportional to the square root of perveance. True assumed that the 
increased focusing field, B+, made necessary by transverse electron 
velocities should be at least

The ratio B+/BB is referred to as the magnetic field intensification ratio. True finds 
that the perveance ratio, PÎ¼
+/PÎ¼, must be multiplied by a factor of 1.65 to minimize 
the beam ripple in actual magnet designs. 
 
The normalized transverse velocity content of the beam, Ï, is composed of 
two parts. The first part, ÏT, results from the thermal velocity content of the beam, 
given by

where rc is the disc radius of the cathode and r95 is the beam radius containing 
95% of the beam current. The other part of Ï is the nonthermal part, ÏNT, which 
results from gun aberrations and scattering by grid wires. This part can be found 
by a computer simulation that includes grid wire details. True found that a good 
approximation for the combined thermal and nonthermal parts is

For gridded guns, ÏNT >> ÏT so Ï â ÏNT. In the remainder of this section, we will 
treat only gridded guns and we will ignore thermal effects. We will also substitute 
Ï for ÏNT. 
 
The value for Ï is found at or near the beam minimum from the weighted 
standard deviation of the slopes of the electron trajectories. Although Ï is defined 

Electron Beams 
 
169 
in terms of slopes, it is essentially equal to vr/uo. True found, as shown in Figure 
7-35, that Ï can be approximated by 
 
 
 
0.0015

Ï
Î¸  
(7-53) 
where Î¸ is the half angle of the electron gun. Note that guns which have small half 
angles also have low values of Ï. The reason was given in Chapter 6 when an 
electron crossing a convergent electron stream was considered. The transverse 
velocity increase was found to be inversely proportional to the radius compression 
ratio. 
 
The next step in the analysis is to incorporate the effect of transverse 
velocities on the spreading of the electron beam. As pointed out earlier in this 
section, True treated the transverse velocity content as a force that, along with the 
space charge force, must be focused by the magnetic field. This is done by finding 
an effective microperveance, which is PÎ¼
+ = PÎ¼ + PÎ¼s. The scattering 
microperveance, PÎ¼s, is found to be related to Ï by

To make use of this equation, the relation between Ï and PÎ¼ is needed. 
Equation (7-53) was an empirical relation between Ï and the gun half angle, Î¸. The 
exact relation between perveance and Î¸ was discussed in Chapter 6. For our 
purposes here, a much simpler equation developed by True can be used. That is,

This result is plotted in Figure 7-36. It is interesting that the intensification factor 
is a function of only the radius compression ratio. We now see why beams from 
high convergence guns require field levels that are significantly higher above the 
Brillouin level than do beams from low convergence guns.

Acceptable limits for this parameter for good tube design are shown in Figure

In the investigation of the stability of PPM-focused beams, we noted that the 
beam stiffness factor, Î»p/L, should be greater than 0.87, but we gave no indication 
of how much greater it should be. True stated that for pulse tubes, Î»p/L should 
exceed 2.7 and for CW tubes, it should be greater than 3.2. These values are large 
enough so that the effects of the individual lenses of the PPM field blend together 
so that the beam approximates a beam focused by a uniform magnetic field. 
 
Before leaving the subject of nonlaminar PPM-focused beams, it is important 
to point out that factors other than RF drive level may cause a beam to increase in 
diameter as it drifts through a tube. This, in turn, would lead to higher interception 
than is expected in the absence of increased beam diameter. These factors may 
also affect the rate at which a beam expands as it enters the collector and this, in 
turn, affects the collector design. To deal with these phenomena, True [26, 27] 
defined the term tunnel emittance, which is given by

(7-61) 
Figure 7-38 shows the growth of tunnel emittance with distance. This growth is 
due partly to an increase in normalized transverse velocity (Ï) and partly to a small 
increase in beam size. 
 
One important factor that affects tunnel emittance growth is the current profile 
of the beam leaving the electron gun. The ideal beam shape is shown in Figure 
7-39(a). This profile is shown slightly dished to match the radial variation in the 
magnetic field. The profiles shown in Figure 7-39(b, c) are less desirable shapes 
because of the concentration of charge in the center of the Gaussian distribution or 
in the ears of the ârabbit earsâ of the hollow distribution. These charge 
concentrations contain potential energy that is converted to increased transverse 
electron velocities as the beam flows through the tube. 
 
Another factor that affects tunnel emittance growth is the entrance point of the 
beam into the magnetic field. True considers the beam minimum position (the 
beam waist) to be the point where tunnel emittance is at a minimum. The axial 
position of the waist should be at the point where the first magnetic field peak has 
risen to 1/
2  of its maximum value.

7.5   ION EFFECTS IN ELECTRON BEAMS 
 
Instabilities caused by positive ions have been observed in microwave tubes since 
their invention. The source of the ions is gas, which is ionized by the electron 
beam. Linear-beam tubes are far more susceptible to ion effects than crossed-field 
tubes because potential wells (depressions), which trap ions, can exist. Ion density 
increases with time so that ion effects are most severe during long-pulse or CW 
operation. The use of confined flow focusing is effective in reducing or, in some 
cases, eliminating instabilities resulting from ions.

7.5.1   Examples of Ion Effects 
 
Ions may affect tube performance in at least the following ways: 
 
 
1. Positive ions neutralize electron space charge potentials within a beam. 
Beam diameter becomes smaller (ion focusing is said to occur), and so 
power output may be affected. Also, interception current decreases with 
time. In extreme cases, the electron beam remains focused in the collector 
and melts a hole through the collector wall which, of course, destroys the 
tube. 
 
2. Because the potential depression in an electron beam is reduced by ions, 
the beam velocity is increased. This reduces the phase length of a tube. 
The change in beam potential can be on the order of 0.01% to 1%. Since 
beam velocity is proportional to the square root of potential, the fractional 
change in velocity is one half of the change in potential. Phase change is 
one half of velocity change. Thus, for a tube phase length of 10,000Â°, the 
resulting decrease in phase is about 0.25Â° to 25Â° and varies with tube 
operating conditions. Under some conditions, the ion density in the beam 
may vary at a frequency of hertz to kilohertz and produce periodic 
changes in power and phase. 
 
3. Gas released from a cathode is ionized in an electron gun and can affect 
electron focusing. If this gas release varies with time (there are reports of 
microbursts of gas from a cathode), the RF power and phase of a tube can 
be affected. 
 
4. Ions can produce high-frequency (megahertz to tens of megahertz) 
oscillations or noiselike fluctuations in the electron beam of a tube. These 
fluctuations result in the modulation of the power output of the tube (ion 
sidebands are said to occur). The frequency of the fluctuations is 
dependent on electron beam density and ion mass. 
 
 
Figures 7-40 through 7-43 show effects of ions in an electron beam. In Figure 
7-40, an electron beam cross section is shown with a significant peak in electron 
density in the center of the beam. It is thought that the peak resulted from positive 
ions in the center of the beam near the electron gun being accelerated toward the 
cathode. Near the center of the cathode, these ions, along with sputtered cathode 
material that becomes ionized, cause sufficient neutralization of the electron space 
charge cloud so that additional electrons leave the cathode. These results were 
obtained at a pressure of about 10â6 torr by the author in the experiments described 
in [27]. 
 
At low pressures (< 1Ã10â8 torr) and long-pulse or CW operation, a low-
frequency (tens of hertz to kilohertz) instability is observed in some linear-beam 
tubes. An example is shown in Figure 7-41 [28]. These results were obtained with 
a Brillouin-focused klystron designed for CW operation. The tube was equipped 

Electron Beams 
 
175 
with a shadow-gridded electron gun. The modulator provided pulse lengths from 1 
Î¼s to 100 ms. The tube was not instrumented to permit an investigation of beam 
behavior, so the details of tube behavior are not known. 
 
At the beginning of each pulse, after an initial turn-on transient, the tube 
operated stably for about 15 ms. Then the tube exhibited an ion induced instability 
with a period of about 5 ms. Transients in the output power were the evidence of 
the instability. If the beam was pulsed off for a period as short as 1 Î¼s, the 
instability would not recur until about 15 ms after the beam had been pulsed on. 
Apparently, the ions dissipated during the 1-Î¼s off period. An important 
conclusion of McCuneâs work is that linear-beam amplifiers can be pulsed off 
periodically for a very short time and be inherently free of ion oscillation 
problems, assuming that the tube has been adequately evacuated. 
 
Figure 7-40   Electron beam cross section showing the effect of ions. 
 
 
Additional examples of low-frequency instabilities caused by ions are shown 
in Figure 7-42 [29]. In this case, variations with time in the phase length of CW, 
confined flow, coupled-cavity traveling wave tubes are shown. Even though these 
phase fluctuations are small (a fraction of a degree for a TWT with a total phase 
length of nearly 10,000Â°), they result in phase noise that interferes with system 
operation.

When the ion concentration becomes sufficient, oscillations may occur as 
indicated by Figure 7-43(a). This figure shows the amplitude of the current to a 
probe in a pulsed Brillouin-focused beam in the presence of hydrogen at a pressure 
of about 10â6 torr. When ion effects were absent, the probe current was as shown 
in Figure 7-43(b). 
 
At the beginning of the pulse with gas present, several cycles of a relatively 
high frequency of oscillation occurred (~8 MHz). After about 2 Î¼s, a lower 
frequency of ~4.5 MHz occurred. Then the higher frequency returned. Finally, at 
the end of the pulse, the probe current become very noisy. These oscillations were 
attributed to the radial motion of ions in the electron beam.

To understand why ions produce instabilities, it is necessary to understand ion 
generation and ion behavior. In addition, the gas pressure in the gun that results 
from evaporation of cathode material, ion sputtering of the cathode and the 
neutralizing of ions that enter the gun must be understood. In the examples 
considered in this chapter, it is not thought that electrons released from the ions 
have an effect on instabilities because they very quickly escape from the beam. 
Ion, electron, and gas behaviors (because of its dependence on ion motion) all 
depend on the potential distribution in the electron beam, so we start with the 
analysis of the potential depression in a beam without ions. Then the effects of 
ionization are introduced. It is shown that, if the potential distribution is such that 
ion traps exist, then low-frequency and high-frequency instabilities may occur. 
Some of these instabilities and possible reasons for them are discussed in detail. 
Frequent reference is made to 20-kV, 3-A coupled-cavity TWTs for which 
detailed measurements were made and operating conditions were carefully 
documented [29].

7.5.2   Gas Sources 
 
Before discussing ions and their effects, it is important to understand the source of 
the ion, which is, of course, the gas in the tube and its interaction with the electron 
beam. Even though great care is taken in materials selection, construction, and 
processing for modern microwave tubes (see Appendix B), the gas pressure in 
these tubes (except for the electron gun) is usually in the 10â8 to 10â9 torr range. At 
these pressures, there are ~107 to 108 gas molecules/cm3, so there is no shortage of 
gas from which ions can be generated.  
 
There are many sources of this gas. Sometimes, as reported in [29], most of 
the structure of the tube is copper, which has been brazed in hydrogen, so it is 
thought that hydrogen is the primary gas species. Because argon is used as the 
shield gas in welding processes, argon is sometimes the primary gas species. Even 
though cleanliness is of utmost importance in the assembly of a tube, carbon-based 
particles may remain after assembly and processing, so there may be a carbon-
based gas in the tube. A virtual leak, which results in the gradual release of gas 
from any one of various sources, can result in the primary gas species being any 
one of many gases. Still, the ultimate pressure in a tube (except for the electron 
gun) is usually in the 10â8 to 10â9 torr range. 
 
The gas pressure in the gun can be about two orders of magnitude above that 
in the remainder of the tube and depends on three phenomena. 
 
 
1. The pressure depends on the constituents of the cathode and the 
temperature at which the cathode is operating. For the dispenser cathode 
used in virtually all linear-beam tubes, it is the barium on the surface of 
the cathode that is evaporated at the cathode temperature of ~1,000Â°C that 
is thought to be the primary gas constituent in the gun. The pressure of 
that gas is estimated to be on the order of 10â6 torr at 1,025Â°C (estimated 
from the pressure of 7.5Ã10â6 torr given in [30] for 1,100Â°C). 
 
2. Ions formed by the interaction of the electron beam with gas tend to 
congregate along the center of the beam. If the potential along the axis of 
the beam is such that the ions can flow into the gun, they form a beam 
that impinges on the center of the cathode (see Figure 7-44). At the 
cathode, they recombine with electrons and produce an increase in gas 
pressure in the gun.  As the pressure increases, the gas flows out as shown 
in Figure 7-45 through the anode to the remainder of the tube. The gas is 
then reionized and reinjected into the gun as an ion beam. The gas flow 
from the gun is restricted by the sizes of the anode tunnel and the 
apertures in the tunnel leading to the interaction region. The increase in 
pressure in the gun can be estimated from the gas flow rate (which is 
assumed to be the same as the rate of flow of ions into the gun) and from 
the conductances of the tunnel and the apertures. In the study reported in 
[29], hydrogen at a pressure of about 10â8 torr was the predominant gas 

Electron Beams 
 
179 
and the increase in pressure in the gun was 10â8 torr or less. For gases 
heavier than hydrogen, the pressure in the gun would be much higher. 
 
3. A very important result of ion impingement on the cathode is the 
sputtering of the cathode surface and the pressure increase that results 
from the sputtered material. This pressure increase depends on ion 
species, gun voltage, and sputtering coefficient of the cathode surface and 
is thought to be significant.

7.5.3   Ionization 
 
The rate at which ions are formed in an electron beam depends on the gas density 
(and thus the pressure, P), the ionization cross section of the gas molecules, Ïi, the 
electron beam current, I, and the length of the beam, d, and is given by

plots of the ionization cross section for some common gases as a function of 
primary electron energy [31]. Values of Ïi for H, N, and O for the high-energy 
collisions shown in Figure 7-46 were not available in [32], so these were estimated 
by scaling from lower energies (0 to 4,000 eV) in the same way that known 
ionization cross sections scale with primary energy.

As pointed out previously, the primary gas constituent in the electron gun is 
thought to be barium. The ionization cross section for barium is not given in [31]; 
however, the cross section for indium is given and is shown in Figure 7-47. The 
atomic weight of barium is about 20% greater than that of indium and the 
ionization potential of barium is about 10% less than that of indium so the 
ionization cross section of barium should be slightly larger than that of indium. 

Electron Beams 
 
181 
Because of this large cross section and the high barium pressure in the gun, the 
possibility that electron focusing in the gun is affected cannot be overlooked.

useful equation can be derived and gives the rate at which the ion density

simply multiply the generation rate found from Figure 7-48 by the factor by which 
the pressure differs from 1Ã10â8 torr. Notice that, if the gas in the beam is nitrogen 
or oxygen and the beam voltage is 10 kV, enough ions will be generated to 
completely neutralize the beam in about 50 ms. Of course, for complete 
neutralization to take place, the ions must be trapped in the beam.

7.5.4   Potential Depression in an Electron Beam 
 
The key to understanding the reasons for the effects of ions on a beam is to 
understand the potential depression in the beam. Ions can affect this depression 
and this can lead to the deleterious effects that ions have on tube operation. The 
potential distribution in a beam of electrons was examined in Chapter 2. As a 
reminder, the cross section of an electron beam that was considered is shown in 
Figure 7-49 and the potential distribution in a metal tunnel containing the electron 
beam is shown in Figure 7-50.

The potential drop from the wall to the center of the beam (the potential 
depression in the beam) increases with an increasing ratio of the tunnel radius, a, 
to the beam radius, b, as shown in Figure 7-51. Notice that the potential depression 
increases rapidly as the beam radius becomes smaller. For a typical beam-filling 
factor (inverse of a/b) of 2/3, V = 1.8 Vo, where Vo is the potential drop within the

and where Vb is the beam voltage in kilovolts. For a 20-kV, 3-A beam, the 
potential depression is 583V. 
 
An example of the potential distribution that may exist along the center of a 
20-kV, 3-A beam is shown in Figure 7-52. Here it has been assumed that the 
filling factor (the fraction of the tunnel radius that is filled by the electron beam) 
for the average beam radius is 2/3. At the gun end of the tube, the potential drops 
very rapidly to the cathode voltage of â20 kV. At the collector end, the potential 
drops to the depressed collector voltage. It has been assumed here that there is no 
scalloping so that the beam radius is constant from the gun to the collector. 
 
Now another example of the usefulness of  Figure 7-48 can be seen by 
considering the following example. Assume a TWT like that in [29] with a 20-kV 
electron beam and that contains hydrogen. The ion accumulation rate at 10â8 torr is 
a little over 0.002 ion/electron/ms. In other words, in a millisecond, the beam is 
about 0.2% neutralized.

The potential depression in a 20-kV beam with a perveance of 1Ã10â6 is about 
600V. In a millisecond, this depression would be reduced by 1.2V so the beam 
voltage would be increased by 1.2V or 0.006%. The beam velocity varies as the 
square root of beam voltage so the beam velocity would increase by 0.003%. In a 
TWT, as the beam goes faster, the phase length of the tube decreases. The 

Electron Beams 
 
185 
incremental change in phase is one half of the change in velocity or, in the case 
being considered, 0.0015%. The total phase length of a TWT is on the order of 
10,000Â°, so the change in phase length would be about 0.15Â°/ms. Notice in the 
upper trace in Figure 7-42 that the phase fluctuations are about 1Â°/10 ms or 
0.1Â°/ms, which is surprisingly close to the estimate of 0.15Â°/ms. 
 
7.5.5   Steady State Effects of Ionization 
 
Next consider the effects of ionization on the potential profiles shown in the 
previous section. For each ionization event that results from the collision of a 
beam electron with a gas molecule, an electron is released. The first question to be 
answered is: What happens to these ionization electrons? 
 
7.5.5.1   Ionization Electron Flow 
 
In the regions where the ionization electrons are generated, the potential is several 
hundred volts below the tunnel wall, so these electrons are strongly attracted 
toward the tunnel wall. However, where the axial magnetic field used to focus the 
electron beam is high, the ionization electrons are prevented from reaching the 
tunnel wall. This can be shown by examining the magnetic flux distribution and 
using the Hull cutoff condition to investigate the radial electron flow. 
 
The Hull cutoff condition is derived in Chapter 17 for axially symmetric 
electric and magnetic fields and is usually applied to the smooth-bore magnetron. 
To use that analysis here, as shown in Figure 7-53, we replace the cathode of the 
magnetron with the electron beam containing ionization electrons. The anode is 
the tunnel wall.

If the potential depression in the beam equals the Hull cutoff potential, the 
electron trajectories just graze the tunnel wall. (This applies throughout the beam 
and assumes that the initial radial velocity of the electrons is zero.) If the 
depression is greater than the Hull cutoff voltage, the ionization electrons escape 
to the wall. If the depression is too small, the electrons return to the beam. 
 
The Hull cutoff voltage can be written as

can be compared with the Hull cutoff potential. Assuming that ionization electrons 
are initially at rest, then when Ve-t / VH or Vc-t / VH  > 1, ionization electrons can 
escape from the beam. When Ve-t / VH or Vc-t / VH  < 1, ionization electrons cannot 
escape.  
 
Figure 7-54 shows the confinement factors, m, and the ratio of a to b for 
which ionization electrons can and cannot escape from the beam. For a filling 
factor of 2/3, 
 
 
1. No electrons escape for the usual focusing condition of B substantially 
above BB. 
 
2. When m = 1 (B = BB), electrons near the edge of the beam can escape and 
electrons in the beam center are trapped. 
 
3. When B drops to 0.8 BB, all of the ionization electrons can escape. 
 
 
As an example, consider again a 20-kV, 3-A beam for which the axial 
focusing field is shown in Figure 7-55. The confinement factor for this example is 
somewhat over m = 2, so all ionization electrons in the main focusing field would 
be confined to the beam. However, near the collector pole piece where the axial 
flux density rapidly drops through B = BB to B â 0, all ionization electrons can 
easily escape from the beam. (In this case the electric field produced by the 
collector voltage has no effect on ionization electrons near the pole piece.)

Near the gun pole piece, the situation is more complicated because the electric 
field from the gun does penetrate into this region and repel ionization electrons. 
Thus, even though the flux density drops to a low value, the gun electric field 
prevents the electrons from reaching this region and escaping. As a result, we 
conclude that, for this confined flow example, the ionization electrons can escape 
from the beam only at the collector end of the tube. 
 
Another example of importance is the PPM-focused beam. Theoretically, the 
peak flux density is 
2
B
B  and this is increased by a factor of about 1.5 in 
practical applications [24â26]. Thus, the peak axial flux density is more than

strong enough to confine the ionization electrons. However, periodically, the flux 
density drops through BB to zero as the focusing field reverses so all ionization 
electrons can escape. 
 
7.5.5.2   Ion Flow 
 
With a constant axial potential depression, it would be expected that ions would 
flow to the gun and the collector. However, as the beam leaves the region of the 
magnetic pole piece at the collector end of the tube and enters the collector, it may 
expand and pass into close proximity to the tube body. This causes the potential 
depression in the beam to decrease, which, in turn, produces a barrier to ion flow 
that prevents all but the most energetic ions from entering the collector. (Ions are 
generated at various potentials because of the radial variation of potential in the 
beam, so they have a distribution of velocities.) Similarly, when the RF drive is 
applied to the TWT and the tube is operating near saturation, the RF bunching 
causes the beam to be large in diameter near the output cavity. This causes the 
potential depression to decrease, which impedes the flow of ions to the collector. 
 
 Another factor to consider is beam scalloping. Variations in the magnetic 
focusing field affect the barrier amplitude at the collector end of the tube and the 
ion level in the tube. The reason for this effect is illustrated in Figure 7-56.

Normally the RF interaction region is many wavelengths long. As the 
magnetic focusing field is varied, large-diameter (and low depression) regions of 
the beam sometimes coincide with the barrier at the collector end and reinforce it 

Electron Beams 
 
189 
(Figure 7-56(a)), which prevents all but the most energetic ions from entering the 
collector. At other magnetic field levels, small diameter (and high depression) 
regions of the beam coincide with the barrier and reduce its amplitude allowing 
more ions to flow to the collector (Figure 7-56(b)). 
 
If the beam produced at the electron gun is imperfect (which is always the 
case to some extent), then there may be a large-diameter region in the beam near 
the gun as shown in Figure 7-57. This region produces a decrease in the potential 
depression and a barrier to the ion flow to the gun. As a result, as shown in Figure 
7-58, there may be barriers to ion flow at the collector and the gun ends of the 
tube. The relative heights of the barriers at the gun and the collector control the 
relative flows of ions to the gun and collector ends of the tube.

Too Close to 
Tube Body

In some TWTs, ions are prevented from flowing to the gun by a positive 
anode. There is speculation for some magnetic field configurations that the beam 
may fill with ions so that the potential depression disappears. Then ions can flow 
radially to the tunnel wall. 
 
7.5.6   Low-Frequency Instabilities 
 
With barriers to ion flow at the gun and collector ends of the tube, the ion 
concentration in the beam increases with time. Often, in long pulse and CW 
operation of linear-beam tubes, low-frequency (hertz to kilohertz) fluctuations are 
observed in the power and phase of the output signal (see Figure 7-42). There have 
been many attempts to attribute these fluctuations to interactions between the 
electron beam and the ions in the RF interaction region of the tube. To the best of 
the authorâs knowledge, none of these attempts has produced results that come 
even close to explaining the experimental results. The work that does explain the 
experimental results is that reported in [29]. That work is summarized here.

the gun and near the collector. 
 
 
Before proceeding, it should be noted that, if the collector barrier is lower 
than the gun barrier, then, as the ion level in the beam increases, more ions of 
increasingly lower energy are able to spill over the barrier into the collector. This 
appears to be an ideal way to get rid of the ions because there does not appear to 
be any way for ions in the collector to cause instabilities. (The exception to this is 
when the ion density is so high in the collector that the electron beam doesnât 
expand properly. Then the beam can damage the collector.) 
 
If the gun barrier is lower than the collector barrier, then, as the ion level in 
the beam increases, ions spill into the gun. Directly and/or indirectly, these ions 
neutralize part of the electron space charge forces in the beam waist (see Figure 
7-59) in the gun and this causes the waist to shrink. As the beam waist shrinks, 
this, in turn, causes the gun barrier to shrink, which allows more ions to spill into 
the gun. This process continues until the beam is drained of ions that can spill over 
the barrier. At this time, the beam waist returns to its normal diameter and the gun 
barrier returns to its normal height. The beam then fills with ions and eventually 
reaches the point where ions again spill into the gun causing the relaxation-type 
oscillation to repeat. 
 
The way in which ions entering a gun affect gun operation is complicated by 
several factors. 
 
 
1. As was pointed out previously, the ions sputter the cathode, and this 
produces a barium/oxygen gas in the gun. The high density of this gas 
coupled with the large ionization cross section of the sputtered atoms 
results in a high rate of generation of ions by the beam in the gun.

2. Usually, as ions accumulate in the beam, the potential depression in the 
beam decreases. However, in the beam waist in the gun, ions can cause 
the potential depression to increase. The reason for this is that increase in 
depression caused by beam shrinkage more than offsets the decrease in 
depression resulting from ion accumulation. The increase in depression 
causes more ions to be trapped. 
 
3. The effect of ions in the beam waist is sometimes exacerbated by an ion 
trap in the waist. The reasons for this trap and the potential depression 
caused by it are shown by the example in Figure 7-60 [29]. Notice that, as 
the beam approaches the beam waist, it passes a nearby ridge on the 
anode and this causes the potential depression on the axis to decrease. 
Then the beam moves away from the anode for a short distance and so the 
depression increases. The beam then approaches a smaller drift tube (and, 
at the same time, the beam diameter increases) so the potential depression 
decreases again. 
 
4. The size of the waist trap also depends on the pressure of cathode 
evaporants in the gun. This pressure, in turn, is dependent on cathode 
temperature and on the total time that the cathode has been operating. The 
reason for the pressure effect is that ions produced by electron collisions 
with these gas atoms reduce the size of the beam entering the beam waist. 
This increases the potential depression (decreases the waist barrier) to the 
left of the waist trap, which reduces the size of the trap.

7.5.7   High-Frequency Instabilities 
 
In Figure 7-43, two high-frequency instabilities are shown by the fluctuations in 
the probe current in beam analyzer experiments. During the lower-frequency 
portions of the pulse, a transverse oscillation of the electron beam was found. That 
is, the peaks and valleys in current in the 2â3-Î¼s time frame of Figure 7-43 were 
found to correspond to alternating transverse positions of the electron beam. The 
higher-frequency oscillation in the 4â5-Î¼s time frame was found to result from a 
fluctuation of the beam radius. 
 
The transverse mode of oscillation, shown in Figure 7-61, may be explained 
with the aid of Figure 7-62, which shows the potential distribution in a drift tube 
containing an electron beam. The motion of an ion is given by

When an ion beam of radius c (as indicated in Figure 7-63) with a charge 
density equal to the electron density is considered, then the analysis becomes more 
complex, but the equation for small displacements of the ion beam is still 
straightforward and is

where d is the radius of the drift tube. Thus, the frequency of ion oscillation is 
reduced. If the diameter of the ion beam increases with time as ion generation 
takes place, it would be expected that the ion oscillation frequency would 
decrease. In fact, this effect has been observed as indicated by Figure 7-64.

During high-frequency portions of the pulse shown in Figure 7-43, a radial 
oscillation of the electron beam was found. That is, the beam diameter changed 
periodically from a relatively large value to a smaller value, as shown in Figure 
7-65. This figure shows probe current as a function of radial probe position in the 
beam at times of maximum and minimum beam diameter.

The radial mode of oscillation may be explained with the aid of Figure 7-66. 
Assume that, initially, the positive ions are uniformly distributed throughout the 
potential well of the electron beam. The ions are attracted and flow to the center of 
the beam. The resulting concentration of ions produces a positive hump in the 
potential well (see Figure 7-67) and a repulsive force, which causes the ions to 
reverse direction and flow radially outward. As the ions flow outward, the 
potential well deepens, causing a strong enough electrostatic force to pull them 
inward again. The radial electrostatic forces in the electron beam depend on the 
ion concentration and so the beam oscillates radially in synchronism with the ions. 
 
When an analysis of the radial mode of oscillation is carried out, it is found 
that the frequency at which the radial oscillations are expected to occur is 
2  
greater than the frequency of transverse oscillations (neglecting ion beam diameter 
effects). 
 
The radial oscillation frequency, like the transverse oscillation frequency, is a 
function of ion mass as well as electron beam density and density profile.

Oscillation frequencies from the range of megahertz to several tens of megahertz 
are common. 
 
The presence of ion oscillations is indicated by ion sidebands on the output 
frequency of a microwave tube. Also, the oscillation frequency is a function of the 
square root of beam voltage (see Figure 7-68). This provides a means for checking 
to determine if gas is the cause of spurious tube output signals.

Beam-Gap Interactions 
 
 
In all microwave tubes, two fundamental interactions of the electron beam and the 
RF circuit are responsible for the operation of the tube. These are indicated on a 
klystron in Figure 8-1. First, in amplifiers, the RF input signal produces a voltage 
on an RF circuit (gap in cavity in Figure 8-1) that initiates bunching (modulation) 
of an electron beam. Second, the RF current in the beam induces current in the 
nearby RF circuit. This current, in turn, interacts with the impedance of the circuit 
to produce a voltage that, until RF power is removed from the tube, enhances the 
modulation of the beam. These interactions, beam modulation and current 
induction, are the subjects of this chapter.

8.1   BEAM MODULATION 
 
In the first klystrons, the beam was modulated by passing it through a gap between 
two parallel grids across which RF voltage was applied. Beam power was very 
limited because of grid heating by electron impact. With the use of gridless gaps, 
beam power can be orders of magnitude above that possible with gridded gaps. 
Modulation by gridded and by gridless gaps is described in the following sections.

8.1.1   Gridded (Planar) Gaps 
 
Consider the interaction of an electron beam with the electric field in a gridded 
(planar) gap as shown in Figure 8-2. The velocity of the beam entering the gap is 
uo and is modified by an amount Îu as the beam passes through the gap. The time 
and position at the entrance to the gap are to and z = 0. The width of the gap is â

Figure 8-3   Gap coupling coefficient as a function of gap transit angle. 
 
 
As is indicated in Figure 8-4, for a very narrow gap, Ïo is small so an electron 
âseesâ a nearly constant voltage as it traverses the gap. For this case, the gap 
coupling coefficient is maximum and is nearly unity. As the gap is widened, the 
voltage varies as an electron traverses the gap and so the effective gap voltage (Veff 
in Figure 8-4) is less than the maximum gap voltage (Vmax). The effectiveness of 
the gap in accelerating the electron decreases (i.e., the gap coupling coefficient 
goes down). If the gap width is increased to the point where Ïo = 2Ï, the applied 
voltage varies through one complete cycle as an electron traverses the gap and the 
net acceleration of the electron is zero. In this case, Mp = 0. 
 
The value of the gap coupling coefficient is that, in the analysis, a gap with a 
finite width â can be replaced with a gap having an infinitesimal width and voltage 
reduced by Mp without affecting the velocity. In addition, the reference plane 
where z = 0 can be shifted from the first grid of the gap to the center of the gap 
where z = â/2. This has been done in (8-2). 
 
The modulation process described here is referred to as velocity modulation. 
The reason, which is clear from (8-2), is that the velocities of electrons are 
âmodulatedâ as they traverse a gap to which an alternating voltage is applied. This 
is in contrast to the situation in a triode or a tetrode where the density of the 
electrons is modulated.

With velocity modulation, the electron beam is first accelerated to high 
velocity and then subjected to the RF modulating field rather than being 
modulated at low (nearly zero) velocity and then accelerated. The result is that the 
transit time limitations of the triode and tetrode are overcome with the velocity 
modulation technique and operation at much higher frequencies and power levels 
is made possible. 
 
8.1.2   Gridless (Nonplanar) Gaps  
 
Gridless gaps are used for velocity modulation in virtually all microwave tubes. 
These gaps are usually formed by two facing electrodes. For cylindrical gaps, the 
fields produced are somewhat as shown in Figure 8-5.

Beam-Gap Interactions

The electric field extends over a large region inside the gap and has variations 
in both the axial and radial directions. When a beam passes through the gap, 
electrons near the axis must travel further to âseeâ the full gap voltage than 
electrons near the gap. The field on axis may go through a large portion of a cycle 
while the field near the gap varies through a small portion as the electrons pass 
through, so electrons on axis receive a smaller net velocity change than those near 
the gap. Thus, the gap coupling coefficient varies with radius. 
 
The analysis of the interaction of the beam in the gridless gap is significantly 
more complicated than in the gridded gap. Still, under small signal conditions, the 
beam velocity can be expressed quite simply as

(8-6) 
where Mnp, which is a function of radius, is the gap coupling coefficient for the 
nonplanar gap. The magnitude of Mnp depends on the electric field distribution 
within the gap. The field, in turn, depends on several factors including the gap 
width, the cylinder radius, and the shapes of the cylinder tips.  
 
For example, as shown in Figure 8-6, if the gap is narrow compared with the 
cylinder radius and the cylinder tips are blunt, then the field within the gap will be 
nearly constant. On the other hand, if the gap is relatively wide and the cylinder 
tips are very sharp, the field will vary in a parabolic-like manner. Kosmahl and 
Branch [1] used a hyperbolic-cosine approximation to the field shape and found 
rather complex relationships for the gap coupling coefficient. A more 
straightforward, but less elegant, approach is that described by Vaughan [2]. He 
used the gap coupling coefficient found for a uniform gap field and then devised 
an empirical correction factor.

With a uniform field in the gap, the field experienced by the electron traveling 
close to the walls of the cylinders is the same as the field in the gridded gap, that 
is, constant, and so the electron velocity leaving the gap (at z = â/2) is given by 
(8-2). The expression found for Mnp as a function of radius is shown in Figure 8-7 
and is

where Mp is the modulation coefficient for the planar (gridded) gap (8-4), Î²e = 
Ï/uo is the propagation constant for the electron beam, and a is the cylinder radius. 
Thus, the modulation coefficient for the gridless gap Mp is modified by 
oI  Bessel 
functions. This shows what is expected for a gridless gap, that the modulation is 
weaker on the axis than at the wall. It is usual practice to limit Î²ea to â 1 to 1.5 to 
ensure adequate interaction with the electron beam.

8.2   CURRENT INDUCTION 
 
8.2.1   Gridded (Planar) Gaps 
 
Consider first a sheet of electron charge passing between two planar parallel grids 
as shown in Figure 8-8. The surface charge density on the charge sheet is assumed 
to be Ïe coulombs per unit area. Electric fields EL and ER are produced by Ïe. 
Positive charge densities ÏL and ÏR are induced on the left and right grids, and as 
the charge sheet moves, electron current Ii flows in the circuit connecting the grids.

where u is the velocity of the charge sheet. The circuit current is Ii = A Ji , where A 
is the area of a grid. 
 
The preceding result is a form of Ramoâs theorem. The importance is that it 
shows that, immediately upon the entrance of a charge into a region, current starts 
to flow in nearby electrodes. The charge can be emitted from one of the electrodes 
and collected by the other or can enter and leave the region through grids. This 
analysis can be applied to RF gaps by assuming that RF magnetic fields are 
negligible (as in conventional microwave tubes) and that field propagation effects 
are negligible (valid if dimensions are small compared with a wavelength). 
 
There is much to be learned from this simple relationship (8-10). First and 
most importantly, the current waveform induced in the grids and circuit may be 
very different than the current waveform of the charge sheet. Since the thickness 
of the charge sheet has been assumed to be infinitesimal, the volumetric charge 
density, Ïe, must be infinite. The current density of the sheet, Je = Ïeu, is therefore 
infinite.

On the other hand, for constant velocity, the current density in the grids is 
constant as the sheet of charge traverses the gap. Thus, Ji has a rectangular 
waveform with a duration Ï = d/u, which is the transit time of the charge sheet 
across the gap. The waveforms for Ji and Je are illustrated in Figure 8-10 for the 
charge sheet located at position z in the gap.

Next, consider the situation when the voltage between the grids is large 
enough to change the electron velocity. Then the induced current waveform is 
changed. For example, assume, as indicated in Figure 8-11, that the left grid is the 
cathode of a diode that emits a sheet of charge at zero velocity and that the right

If several sheets of charge are considered, then, as long as interactions 
between them are ignored, the current waveforms produced are superimposed. For 
the case of several sheets of electrons emitted at random times and leaving the 
cathode with zero velocity and being accelerated across the gap to an anode, the 
current pulses might appear as shown in Figure 8-13. This situation is fundamental 
to the analysis of shot noise in the current emitted by a cathode.

To determine the current induced by an electron beam, the beam can be 
divided into slices with a thickness Îz, each one of which induces the current 
density, ÎJi, into the circuit. This is indicated in Figure 8-14. Then all of the 
increments of current can be added to obtain I i = A J i  where

The process by which the sinusoidal component of beam current is induced in 
a circuit is shown graphically in Figure 8-15. At time to, the position of the beam is 
such that the increase in beam charge density (electron bunch) is equal and 
opposite to the adjacent decrease in density (sometimes called an antibunch and 
denoted here by plus signs), so the electron current, Ii, induced in the circuit at to is 
zero. At time, t1, only an electron bunch is between the grids and the induced 
current is maximum. The situation at t2 is similar to that at to in that the net beam 
charge between the grids is zero and the induced current is zero. At t3, only an 
antibunch is between the grids and the circuit current is minimum.

In these discussions of current induction, as long as the gap voltage is small 
compared to the beam voltage, the induced current depends only on the geometry 
of the gap. However, the interaction of the induced current with the impedance of 
the circuit attached to the gap does produce a voltage across the gap. That voltage, 
in turn, does produce effects on the beam. 
 
First, it is important to remember that, as a function of frequency, the 
impedance of a parallel RLC circuit is as shown in Figure 8-16. When an electron 
beam modulated at frequency fo passes through the gap, the induced current flows 
through the resistive portion of the circuit and produces the voltage shown in 
Figure 8-17. The phase of the induced voltage is such that it slows the bunch 
(slightly at small signal levels). At the same time, a new signal is launched on the 
beam, which is 90Â° out of phase with Ii. Part of the energy extracted from the 
bunch is dissipated in Rsh and part is used to launch the new signal.

Figure 8-17   When the circuit is resistive (because the electron beam is modulated at fo), 
the gap voltage generated is phased 180Â° with respect to the induced current. Energy is 
extracted from the bunch. 
 
 
When the electron beam is modulated at f1 < fo, the impedance presented to 
the beam is primarily inductive. The phase of the induced voltage with respect to Ii 
is as shown in Figure 8-18. (Remember, with conventional current in an inductive 
circuit, voltage leads current. With electron current, voltage lags current.) The 
voltage across the gap at to decelerates electrons in and near the leading edge of 
the bunch and enhances bunching. When the voltage has reversed 180Â° later, it 
accelerates electrons in and near the trailing edge of the bunch and again enhances 
bunching. Thus, at small signal levels, the signal launched on a beam by an 
inductive circuit voltage is in phase with the signal on the beam. At large signal 
levels near the output circuit of a klystron, an inductively tuned resonator is 
frequently used to enhance bunching by sweeping electrons from regions between 
bunches (decelerating electrons ahead of a bunch and accelerating those behind).

Figure 8-18   When the circuit is inductive, the induced voltage lags the electron current by 90Â°. 
 
 
When the electron beam is modulated at f2 > fo, the impedance of the resonant 
circuit is primarily capacitive as shown in Figure 8-19. In this case the induced 
electron current lags the voltage by 90Â°. The resulting effect on the electron 
bunches in the beam is the opposite of that which takes place with an inductive 
circuit. Thus, the voltage accelerates electrons away from the leading and trailing 
edges of a bunch, which tends to destroy the bunch. At small signal levels, the 
signal launched on the beam by a capacitive circuit is 180Â° out of phase with the 
signal on the beam.  
 
In the following chapter, it will be shown that the RF beam current density 
produced by a modulating cavity, J1, is proportional to the velocity modulation,

8.2.2   Gridless (Nonplanar) Gaps 
 
The principles described for current induction in a gridded gap apply equally well 
in a gridless gap. Here, the appropriate gap coupling coefficient must be used. At a 
very large signal level, such as that in the output cavity of an efficient klystron, it 
is important to accurately model radial and axial fields in the interaction region. 
This was shown by Kosmahl and Albers in an accurate three-dimensional analysis 
of the performance of output gaps in klystron amplifiers [3]. 
 
The electron beam was divided into axially and radially deformable rings. 
Figure 8-20 shows the trajectory of an outer ring that was slowed down 
substantially and finally intercepted. In this figure, only the right half of the gap is 
shown. The left half is a mirror image of the right half. The phase of the RF is 
indicated along the trajectory. At Ït near 300Â° and close to the tunnel tip, the ring 
rapidly decelerated, stopped moving in the axial direction, and then reversed its 
axial motion. The convergent action of the field pushed the ring inward and then, 
in the accelerating phase of the field, the axial motion again reversed and the ring 
was accelerated almost radially outward and was intercepted by the tunnel wall. 
 
 
8.3   BEAM LOADING 
 
The bunching action in a cavity of a klystron speeds up electrons over half the RF 
cycle and slows them down over the other half. When the gap transit angle is 
small, the energy of electrons leaving the gap, averaged over a cycle, is nearly 
equal to the energy with which they enter the gap. As the gap transit angle is 
increased, the average energy of electrons leaving the gap becomes greater than 
the entering energy. As a result, power must be supplied to bunch the electrons 
and there is an equivalent resistance that can be assigned to the beam to represent 
the load in which the power is dissipated. This resistance is called the beam 
loading resistance.

In examining equivalent circuits of klystron cavities, we will use admittances 
rather than impedances, so the beam loading conductance will be of interest. The 
beam also provides a reactive component of admittance, which changes the 
resonant frequency of the cavity by a small amount.

Electron Bunching Produced by a Gap 
 
 
In Chapter 8, the modulation of an electron beam was examined. It was shown that 
the velocities of the electrons in the beam are modulated during the interaction 
with the circuit. In a klystron, this interaction occurs at discrete locations along the 
length of the device. In a traveling wave device (a TWT and a crossed-field 
device), the interaction is continuous because the electric field on the circuit that 
modulates the beam travels along the circuit in synchronism with the electron 
bunches in the beam. There are significant differences between the bunching 
action in a klystron and that in a traveling wave device. In this chapter, we 
describe klystron bunching. The bunching that occurs in the presence of a 
traveling wave in a TWT is discussed in Chapter 12. Bunching in a crossed-field 
device is covered in Chapters 19 and 20. 
 
 
9.1   BALLISTIC BUNCHING 
 
The term ballistic bunching is used to describe the bunching of electrons when 
space charge forces are neglected. Consider again the equation that was developed 
in Chapter 8 for the velocity of electrons that have interacted with a modulating 
electric field,

This relation shows, as is expected, that when an electron beam is passed through 
a modulating electric field, some electrons have their velocities increased, some 
have their velocities decreased, and some have their velocities unchanged. After 
the beam leaves the field, those electrons that have had their velocity increased 
gradually overtake the slower electrons. This process is illustrated in Figure 9-1, 
which is known as an Applegate diagram. Axial positions of electrons are plotted 
as a function of time, and so the slopes of lines represent electron velocities. The 
trajectories of electrons leaving the modulating field when it is decelerating 
(indicated at the bottom of the figure) are represented by lines of reduced slope.

Similarly, the trajectories of accelerated electrons are represented by lines of 
increased slope. 
 
In Figure 9-1, space charge forces between electrons have been ignored, so 
the electron trajectories are shown to cross. In practice, at small and medium drive 
signal levels, space charge forces prevent electron trajectories from crossing. That 
situation is discussed later in this chapter. At large signal levels, electron 
trajectories do cross, so the following discussion is relevant to that situation.

As a result of the convergence of electron trajectories illustrated by the 
Applegate diagram, electron bunching is said to occur. The traveling electron 
bunches constitute an RF current in the electron beam. For this ballistic case, the 
RF current in the beam is

is called the bunching parameter. If Î± is small, then i1 â Io, that is, i1 is 
approximately the dc beam current. 
 
The current waveforms as a function of axial position are sketched in Figure 
9-2 (see also [1]). Note that, because of the cosine function in the denominator 
with an arbitrarily large multiplier, infinite current peaks are possible with this 
analysis. In practice, very large peaks may occur but, as will be shown later, space 
charge forces limit the amplitudes of the peaks.

The current waveforms shown in Figure 9-2 are rich in harmonics, but usually 
the only component of interest is the fundamental component. This may be 
obtained [2] by doing a Fourier analysis of the waveforms. When this is done, the 
fundamental component of RF current, if , is found to be

which if is maximum is 1.84, and so the axial position, z, at which the peak value 
occurs is

In a device like a two-cavity klystron where it is desirable to locate a second 
gap at the point of maximum fundamental current, a problem arises because of 
(9-5). The position of maximum current is inversely proportional to the depth of 
modulation, Î±, and therefore to the RF drive level. Once a position has been 
chosen, then for larger or smaller drive levels, the peak current in the beam 
remains the same but the axial position of the peak changes. Also, once a drive 
level and position have been chosen, the relationship between drive level and RF 
current is not linear because of the J1 function. Fortunately, this problem is 
alleviated when space charge effects are taken into consideration.

9.2   BUNCHING WITH SPACE CHARGE FORCES  
 
The Applegate diagram in Figure 9-1 illustrates electron bunching after a beam is 
passed through a modulating gap when space charge forces are ignored. For small 
signal levels, when space charge forces are considered, the process of velocity 
modulation within the modulating gap is altered very little. This is because the 
electrons barely move from their dc positions as the beam passes through the gap. 
 
As electrons converge in the bunching process after the beam leaves the 
modulating gap, space charge forces build up, impeding the rate at which fast 
electrons overtake slow electrons. In addition, slow electrons have their velocities 
increased because of the bunch that forms behind them (toward the modulating 
cavity). The resulting electron trajectories are illustrated in Figure 9-4, which is a 
portion of an Applegate diagram modified to show the effects of space charge 
forces. Trajectories in the absence of space charge forces are also shown. 
 
At the axial position denoted by Î»p/4, fast electrons have been slowed to the dc 
velocity of the beam and slow electrons have been accelerated to the dc beam 
velocity. At Î»p/4, all electrons have the same velocity. Also, at Î»p/4, the RF 
electron density and the RF current reach maximum values. For small to medium 
RF signals, the RF current is nearly sinusoidal. 
 
A very important characteristic of the bunching process with space charge 
forces is that all electrons are either speeded up or slowed down to the same 
velocity (the dc beam velocity) at the same axial position (Î»p/4). In addition, even 
if the amplitude of the modulating field is changed so that initial electron 
velocities are changed, the axial position of the bunch remains the same. This 
result is extremely important to the klystron engineer because, unlike the situation 
when space charge forces are ignored, the cavity location for maximum RF beam 
current is not a function of signal level, of gap width, or of frequency of operation. 
The distance, Î»p, is the electron plasma wavelength. The origin of this wavelength 
is the natural frequency of oscillation (the electron plasma frequency) of a cloud of 
electrons and the velocity with which the cloud of electrons is moving.

To understand electron plasma oscillations, it is useful to start by considering 
an electron cloud that, as a whole, is not moving. The transverse dimensions of the 
cloud are assumed to extend to infinity and stationary ions are assumed to be 
uniformly distributed throughout the cloud to neutralize the average charge of the 
electrons. (These ions will not affect the electron plasma oscillations.) 
 
Initially, assume that the electrons are uniformly distributed as shown in 
Figure 9-5(a). Assume further that some electrons have been accelerated to the left 
and some have been accelerated to the right as indicated by the arrows. (This could 
be accomplished by moving a pair of parallel grids, between which an RF voltage 
is applied, through the cloud. This is similar to what happens in modulating gaps 
in a klystron except that, in those cases, the electrons move and the gaps are 
stationary.) 
 
After acceleration, electrons move to the right and to the left as indicated in 
Figure 9-5(b). Regions of high density (bunches) form and the resulting space 
charge forces in these bunches cause the electron movement to stop and then 
reverse directions. Next, as indicated in Figure 9-5(c), the electrons become 
uniformly distributed again but are moving in directions opposite to those shown 
in Figure 9-5(a). As the electrons continue to move, new bunches form as 
indicated in Figure 9-5(d). Again the space charge forces that build up in the 
bunches cause the electron movement to stop and reverse directions. After that, the 
distribution shown in Figure 9-5(a) returns and the process starts over again. The 
electrons continue to move back and forth at a frequency known as the electron 
plasma frequency, which is given by

The plasma frequency is dependent only on the electron density, Ïo. We will see 
later that Ïp is an extremely important quantity in the analysis and understanding 
of wave motion in a TWT.  
 
To appreciate the magnitude of the plasma frequency, consider a 10,000-V, 
1-A electron beam with a diameter of 2 mm. The electron plasma frequency, f p, is

which is well below the operating frequency of the TWT containing that beam. 
 
The preceding discussion of electron plasma oscillations was for a stationary 
cloud of electrons. When the cloud is moving so that an electron beam is formed, 
the plasma oscillations are not affected (unless the beam velocity is high enough 
that relativistic effects are important). Then, referring back to Figure 9-4, the 
situation at z = 0 is like that in Figure 9-5(a). At Î»p/4, the electrons are compressed 
as shown in Figure 9-5(b). This is one-quarter of a cycle of oscillation after z = 0

This length is much greater than the beam diameter, so boundary effects (the 
relatively small diameter of the beam and the presence of a nearby metallic 
structure) have a considerable impact on the magnitude of the electric fields 
between the bunches. The fields are reduced, so Ïp is reduced and Î» p is increased. 
 
For a confined beam (no transverse electron velocities because of large Bz), as 
shown in Figure 9-6, the effect of finite beam radius on plasma frequency is shown 
in Figure 9-7. Here Ïq is the reduced plasma frequency and F is called the plasma 
frequency reduction factor. Note that, if Ïb/uo = 1 and n = 1.5, the value of F is 
about 0.5, so the plasma frequency is one-half of the value calculated for an 
infinite beam. Correspondingly, the plasma wavelength for the confined beam, Î»q, 
is twice the value calculated for an infinite beam. Thus, the maximum RF current 
in the beam occurs at a distance from the modulating cavity that is twice that for 
the infinite beam.

When transverse electron velocities are present, as in a Brillouin focused 
beam, the plasma frequency is reduced even more than it is in a confined beam. 
The reason for this can be explained with the aid of Figures 9-8 and 9-9. For cavity 
modulation of a Brillouin beam at small signal levels, the electron bunching exists 
as a modulation of the radius of the beam rather than as a modulation of the beam 
density. In Figure 9-9, the electric field pattern for the bunches in a Brillouin beam 
(depicted as plus and minus charges on the surface of the beam) is compared to 
that for the confined beam. Note that the field lines can bow inward as well as 
outward from the surface bunches on the Brillouin beam. As a result, the axial 
component of the field and the space charge forces are smaller than for the 
confined beam. This results in a lower plasma frequency and a larger plasma 
wavelength for the Brillouin beam than for the confined beam.

The plasma frequency reduction factors for a Brillouin beam are shown in 
Figure 9-10. It should be noted that the values of F for the Brillouin beam are 
somewhat smaller than for confined flow. For example, for n = 1.5 and Ïb/uo = 1, 
the value of F is about 0.4, whereas, for the confined beam, the value is 0.5. 
 
In the ballistic analysis there is no need to consider propagating electric and 
magnetic fields. However, when space charge effects are considered, these fields 
must be included and the analysis is far more complex. When the analysis is 
carried out, the results are straightforward as would be expected from the previous 
qualitative discussion.

If we move along the beam at a velocity such that Ït = Î²ez or at z/t = uo (the

and all electrons have the same velocity (uo) at Î»q/4. The reason for this has been 
discussed earlier in this chapter. As the fast electrons approach the slow ones 
at z = Î» q/4, a bunch is formed. Furthermore, the bunching action causes the fast 
electrons to slow to the dc velocity and the slow electrons to speed up to the dc 
velocity. As electrons drift beyond Î»q/4, the space charge forces within the bunch 
cause the electrons in the front of the bunch to speed up and those in the rear of the 
bunch to slow down.

Now, Jz = 0 at z = 0 and varies sinusoidally with distance as shown in Figure

position where the ac velocity goes to zero. If the electrons drift beyond Î» q/4, then 
the bunch disperses and the current density decreases. The bunch and current 
density disappear at Î»q/2 and then reappear as the beam passes Î» q/2.

9.3   LARGE SIGNAL EFFECTS 
 
At the beginning of this chapter, we examined bunching with no space charge 
forces. This ballistic bunching produced an RF current that depended only on the 
bunching parameter, X, which was proportional to Î±z (Î± = depth of modulation and 
z = distance along the electron beam). The maximum RF current was 1.16 times 
the dc beam current. This same maximum RF current could be obtained at any 
drive level (any Î±) simply by choosing the correct axial position in the beam. 
Thus, current as a function of distance and drive level is as shown in Figure 9-14.

Figure 9-14   RF current as functions of axial position and drive level for ballistic 
bunching. 
 
 
When the effects of space charge on bunching were considered, the variation 
of RF current with Î± and z was found to be very different than for the ballistic 
case. At small signal levels, the maximum RF current always occurred at the same 
distance from the modulating cavity, Î» q/4. As the drive level was varied, the 
amplitude of the current varied and the current as a function of distance and drive 
level is as shown in Figure 9-15. 
 
The transition from space charge wave to ballistic behavior was perhaps best 
illustrated by Mihran [3]. He used the experimental apparatus in Figure 9-16 to 
measure RF currents in a beam modulated by a klystron cavity. Mihranâs 
apparatus was a two-cavity klystron with the following additional features: 
 
 
1. The output cavity was movable allowing drift length to be variable. 
 
2. A control grid allowed variation of beam current at fixed beam voltage. 
 
3. A series of apertures could be placed over the control grid allowing 
variation of the beam diameter.

4. The output cavity was tuned to a frequency, f2, which was sufficiently far 
from the input frequency to ensure that the RF output voltage would 
always be much lower than the beam voltage. This guaranteed that small 
signal conditions would prevail in the output gap, thus giving direct 
information on the electron bunching in the beam.

behavior. (From: T. G. Mihran, IRE Trans. Electron Devices, January 1959. Â© 1959 IRE 
(now IEEE).) 
 
 
The most significant result of Mihranâs work was the demonstration of the 
amount by which the distance between cavities should be below Î»q/4 at large 
signal levels. Mihran gave the optimum distances between cavities of a 
multicavity klystron as being approximately: 
90Â°: 90Â°: â â â : 65Â° : 45Â°: 30Â° 
that is, the spacing between cavities should vary from Î» q/4 to 1/3 Î»q/4 as the signal 
increases from the input level to saturation. Mihran was the first to specify the 
amount by which drift lengths should be reduced in the output region of a klystron. 
These reduced spacings resulted in improved efficiencies. This will be discussed 
in detail in following chapters. 
 
Large signal theories failed to predict the drift tube shortening that Mihran 
demonstrated was necessary to optimize efficiency. However, Webber [4] was 
able to use a disk electron model like that shown in Figure 9-18 and compute 
curves for current versus distance. In Webberâs model, 16 disks per wavelength 
were used for most calculations. Charge was uniformly distributed throughout the 
disks and the disks were invariant throughout the calculation. The space charge 
force was determined by first calculating the electric field due to a single disk and

then obtaining the average axial force on another disk. The total force on a disk 
was obtained by integrating this force expression over all other disks in the beam.

The disks were assumed to behave ballistically, like individual electrons, in 
that each was given an initial velocity and/or phase position and then was allowed 
to bunch accordingly. Disks were allowed to cross over or pass through one 
another. Some shortcomings of Webberâs model are: 
 
 
1. Only axial motions of electrons or disks were considered. 
 
2. The disk approximation did not allow any variation of velocity or density 
modulation across the beam. 
 
 
By assuming the beam to consist of concentric rings of charge as shown in 
Figure 9-19, these shortcomings could be overcome. Webber did not do this 
because of the large computer storage capacity required and because he thought 
the effort to be of questionable value in view of other factors which limit the 
performance of actual devices.

A set of Webberâs curves showing current versus distance is shown in Figure 
9-20. The quantity Î± contained in Ïq/ÏÎ± is the depth of modulation so decreasing 
values of Ïq/ÏÎ± correspond to increasing drive levels. In general, there is good 
agreement with Mihranâs experimental results. The primary difference is in the 
transition from space-charge limited behavior to ballistic behavior. Mihranâs 
results show a more gradual transition than do Webberâs calculations. Mihran 
points out that the disagreement is probably attributable to the inaccuracy of the 
disk electron assumption for large Î³b where Î³ = Ï/uo. For Î³b = 2 (Mihranâs results 
are for Î³b = 2.09 and Webberâs calculations are for Î³b = 1.6), there is a 2 to 1 
variation of fields from the beam edge to the beam center. This would warp the 
electron disks assumed in Webberâs calculations.

Another example of the results of Webberâs calculations is shown in Figure 
9-21. Here Î³b = 0.4 and the beam was considerably smaller in diameter than for 
the example shown in Figure 9-20. Notice that, for very large drive levels, the 
current exceeds the ballistic value of 1.16 Io by a substantial amount. The reason 
for this is that space charge is actually enhancing the bunching process. Webber 
showed that electrons near the center of the bunch, which would normally cross 
over (fast electrons would pass slow ones) if moving ballistically, are stopped and 
reversed relative to the center of the bunch before crossing takes place. The result 
is that the fundamental component of current in the beam is enhanced. Webber

showed that the charge densities at which this effect is optimized correspond to 
relatively low beam perveances. We will see in a later chapter when high- 
efficiency klystrons are discussed that a relatively low perveance (substantially 
less than 1Ã10â6) is necessary for high efficiency.

Experiments have been performed to verify the prediction that the RF current 
in a Brillouin-focused beam exists as a modulation of the radius of the beam [5]. 
The RF beam analyzer used for the measurements is shown in Figure 9-22. This 
was the analyzer used for the dc beam measurements described in Chapter 7. The 
analyzer was modified for RF current measurements. The beam from a shielded 
Pierce gun was focused with a solenoid. A vacuum ball valve was used to permit 
changes to be made in the measurement apparatus without exposing the gun and 
cathode to air (which could have changed the beam characteristics). The beam was 
velocity-modulated at approximately 2,000 MHz. A beam-scanning mechanism 
with a 0.010-inch aperture was used for sampling currents at various transverse 
and axial positions.  
 
Plots of the fundamental component (harmonics could also be observed) of 
RF beam current as functions of the transverse and axial position in the beam are 
shown in Figure 9-23 [6]. The RF drive powers of 10W, 50W, and 200W 
corresponded to approximate values of Î± of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5, respectively. At the 
smallest drive level (10W) the RF current was entirely on the surface of the beam.

The predicted space-charge wave behavior of the electrons is clearly 
illustrated by four half plasma wavelengths of variation of the beam current. At the 
medium drive level the space-charge wave behavior became severely distorted. At 
the highest drive level, the space-charge wave behavior disappeared.

Electron energy measurements were made to obtain a measure of the RF 
velocities of electrons in the beam. First, the peak values of the electron energies 
were determined at relatively low values of Î±. The Faraday cage used for 
collecting the electrons passing through the 0.010-inch aperture in the 
beam-scanning mechanism was biased to a negative voltage (4,800V) comparable 
to the dc beam voltage. In addition, a 10,000-Mâ¦ resistor was placed in series 
with the bias batteries. With this large resistance, only a fraction of a microampere 
of current to the Faraday cage caused an additional bias of several hundred to 
several thousands of volts. A fraction of a microampere was less than 0.1% of the 
normal peak Faraday cage current and consisted therefore of only those electrons 
having the maximum energy. 
 
Shown in Figure 9-24 are the peak energies (expressed in terms of the bias 
voltage on the Faraday cage) up to an Î± of approximately 0.1. At small values of Î±, 
the variation of energy was a series of half sinusoids, as expected. When Î± 
exceeded 0.05, the energy profiles became distorted. At values of Î± much above 
0.1 (not shown), the profiles became so severely distorted as to be essentially 
meaningless.

Basic Klystrons and Their Operation 
 
 
The klystron is one of two major classes of devices categorized as linear-beam 
(O-type) tubes. The other is the traveling wave tube (TWT). The family tree of 
linear-beam tubes given in Figure 10-1 shows some types of klystrons and 
traveling wave tubes, and also indicates that there are hybrid devices that combine 
the klystron and TWT technologies.

parts of the interaction structure. The RF signal is carried from cavity to cavity by 
the electron beam. 
 
In the coupled-cavity version of the TWT, cavities similar in appearance to 
klystron cavities are used. There are coupling apertures in the walls of the cavities 
so that the RF energy can propagate along the interaction structure in addition to 
being carried along by the electron beam. The propagation of the signal along the 
interaction structure is a primary distinguishing feature between TWTs and 
klystrons.

In the extended interaction klystron (EIK) one or more of the single cavities 
of the conventional klystron is replaced by a structure containing two or more 
interaction gaps. Bandwidth is increased over that of the conventional klystron. In 
addition, at the output end of the tube, the voltage at each interaction gap is 
reduced, permitting operation at very high-power levels. 
 
The twystron consists of a klystron input section and a coupled-cavity output 
section. Twystrons are capable of several megawatts at bandwidths of 10â15%. 
 
 
10.1   THE INVENTION AND BASIC OPERATION OF THE KLYSTRON 
 
Research leading to the development of the klystron had its start in the mid- and 
late 1930s. The impetus for this research was the need for higher RF powers at 
higher frequencies than could be generated by triodes and tetrodes, which were 
limited in frequency by the transit time of electrons in the cathode-grid region. 
When the transit time approaches the period of the RF signal, gain decreases 
rapidly. The first published account of a major advance that would eventually lead 
to the klystron (magnetron-like devices had appeared earlier) was given by Heil 
and Heil [2]. This device, called the Heil tube, is shown in Figure 10-6. 
 
In the Heil tube, an electron beam passed through a floating drift tube, which 
the Heils called an oscillating Faraday cage, to a collector. The drift tube was 
connected to a tuned circuit. A small RF voltage across the gap at the entrance into 
the drift tube caused velocity modulation of the electrons. That is, the voltage 
across the gap accelerated some electrons and decelerated others. The faster 
electrons from the accelerating portion of a cycle caught up with the slower ones 
from the decelerating portion and so bunches of electrons were formed. When the 
bunches emerged from the drift tube, they induced a signal in the tuned circuit 
and, at the same time, enforced the velocity modulation of the beam entering the 
drift tube. The way in which this device operated made use of the transit time of 
the electrons, which had been a problem in triodes and tetrodes. The Heil tube was 
an experimental oscillator that apparently was not used for any practical 
application; however, it is credited as being the first linear-beam device to use the 
principle of velocity modulation of electrons.

In 1937, the Varian brothers first described their work on the klystron, which 
also used the principle of velocity modulation, but also replaced the lumped 
element tuned circuits with resonant cavities. Figure 10-7 is an entry from Russell 
Varianâs notebook and shows the basic two-cavity configuration of the klystron.

Basic Klystrons and Their Operation 
 
241 
 
The Varians described the klystron in the Journal of Applied Physics in 1939 
[3]. The following abstract from the Variansâ paper contains a concise and very 
clear description of the basic operating principles of the klystron. 
 
âA High Frequency Oscillator and Amplifierâ 
Russell H. Varian and Sigurd F. Varian 
 
Abstract 
 
 
A dc stream of cathode rays of constant current and speed is sent through a 
pair of grids between which is an oscillating electric field, parallel to the 
stream and of such strength as to change the speeds of the cathode rays by 
appreciable but not too large fractions of their initial speed. After passing 
these grids the electrons with increased speeds begin to overtake those 
with decreased speeds ahead of them. This motion groups the electrons 
into bunches separated by relatively empty spaces. At any point beyond 
the grids, therefore, the cathode ray current can be resolved into the 
original dc plus a nonsinusoidal ac. A considerable fraction of its power 
can then be converted into power of high frequency oscillations by running 
the stream through a second pair of grids between which is an ac electric 
field such as to take energy away from the electrons in bunches. These two 
ac fields are best obtained by making the grids form parts of the surfaces 
of resonators of the type described in [this Journal]. 
 
 
Figure 10-8 shows the two-cavity amplifier described by the Varians in the 
Journal of Applied Physics. An electron beam (stream of cathode rays) from the 
cathode at the bottom of the figure is velocity modulated by the lower resonator 
(called a ârhumbatronâ by the Varians). Electron bunching occurs as the beam 
drifts toward the upper cavity. The resulting ac current in the beam induces current 
in the second cavity and results in RF power out of the klystron which is 
substantially larger than the RF input power. 
 
It was not long after the invention of the two-cavity amplifier that a three-
cavity klystron was developed. In this device, the third cavity (sometimes called 
an idler cavity) was inserted between the input and output cavities and was not 
coupled to any external circuit. As the electron bunches produced by the first 
cavity passed through the idler cavity, RF current was induced in the cavity. This 
current produced an RF electric field across the gap which enhanced the velocity 
modulation of the beam. As a result, the gain of the device was increased. 
 
It was next found that, by adding a fourth cavity between the idler and the 
output cavity, the efficiency could be increased. This fourth cavity, which was 
called the penultimate (next to last) cavity, was tuned to a higher frequency than 
the center frequency of operation of the tube. The effect, as is explained in Chapter 
9, was to enhance the bunching of the beam in the output cavity.

Varian and S. F. Varian, Jour. App. Phys.., May 1939.) 
 
 
Two-, three- and four-cavity klystrons are relatively narrowband devices. The 
possibility of increasing the bandwidth by adding idler cavities increase bandwidth 
was postulated in the 1940s. However, increasing the bandwidth in this way is not 
as easy as it first appears to be because the cavities of a klystron are all coupled to 
the same electron beam and so their tuning characteristics are not independent. If 
not tuned properly, some of the idler cavities will demodulate the beam and 
produce holes (regions of reduced gain) in the frequency response. It was not until 
1957 that Kreuchen et al. [4] satisfactorily analyzed the multicavity klystron and 
described a method for increasing bandwidth with reasonably flat power output 
across the band. 
 
In addition to properly tuning the idler cavities, it is necessary to have an 
output structure that can cover the required bandwidth. It was the development of 
double-tuned and triple-tuned cavities along with the merging of TWT and 
klystron technologies that resulted in devices with bandwidths exceeding 10%. 
The configurations of some of these devices are shown in Chapter 11. 
 
In principle, the gain of the klystron amplifier can be increased indefinitely by 
adding cavities along the beam. In practice, with a six-cavity amplifier, a stable 
gain in excess of 110 dB has been observed. Normally, the gain is limited to 50 to 
60 dB. At higher levels, the shot noise of the beam is increasingly amplified, and 
the signal-to-noise ratio of the output is reduced. In addition, to obtain stability, 

Basic Klystrons and Their Operation 
 
243 
there must be no feedback from output to input, either because of leakage of 
transmission line connections, RF modulation of collector leads, and feedback to 
the electron gun, or reflected electrons within the beam. 
 
The elements of a five-cavity klystron are shown in Figure 10-9. The 
intermediate cavities are used to increase the gain and usually the bandwidth. 
Often, the spacings between cavities vary in the way reported by Mihran and 
discussed in Chapter 8. The intermediate cavities are often one-quarter of a plasma 
wavelength (Î»q/4) apart. The spacing between the penultimate cavity (next to last 
cavity) and the last cavity is less than Î»q/4 because of the ballistic nature of the 
bunching process at the large signal levels in the beam near the output end of the 
tube.

In many modern klystrons, the spacings between intermediate cavities are not 
Î»q/4. The spacings are adjusted to optimize bandwidth and/or efficiency. Spacings 
for high efficiency and extremely broad bandwidths are discussed in Chapter 11. 
Optimization is often done using computational techniques and a disk model of the 
electron beam. An example of a calculation for a seven-cavity klystron is shown in 
Figure 10-10. This figure is basically an Applegate diagram in which dc velocities 
of the electrons have been removed. Each trace represents the phase of a disk of 
electrons relative to the undisturbed phase. Thirty electron disks per RF cycle were 
used in Figure 10-10 and two RF cycles are shown. The pairs of dashed vertical 
lines show positions of cavities. In this case the last cavity was an extended 
interaction cavity (to be discussed in Chapter 11) with two gaps. 
 
In the regions of cavities 1 and 2, where the signal levels were very small, the 
change in velocities of the disks as they pass through the gaps, shown by the 
leading or lagging phase, was small. At the third gap, the signal was large enough 
to produce large velocity modulation, the magnitude of which is indicated by the 
slopes of the phase lines. The resulting bunching of the beam is indicated by the 
convergence of the phase lines just before the fourth cavity. At the fourth and 
subsequent cavities, the nonlinear nature of the interaction is readily apparent 
because of the crossing of phase lines, which means that some disks were passing 
others.

From the calculation of phase positions, velocities, and densities, RF currents 
were calculated and power output could be determined. By adjusting cavity 
locations, resonant frequencies, and Qs, the bandwidth and efficiency were 
optimized.  
 
 
10.2   KLYSTRON CAVITIES 
 
10.2.1   Cavity Operation 
 
Cavity resonators are used in klystrons to apply a signal to the electron beam and 
then to remove the amplified signal from the beam. From a circuit point of view, 
each resonator can be considered to be a resonant parallel LC circuit that has been 
modified so that it will operate at microwave frequencies. This is illustrated in 
Figure 
10-11. 
As 
frequency 
is 
increased, 
the 
multiturn-inductor, 
multiplate-capacitor circuit in Figure 10-11(a) is eventually replaced by the circuit 
in Figure 10-11(b) in which the inductor has a single half turn and the capacitor 
has a single pair of closely spaced parallel plates. To further increase frequency, 
the capacitance is reduced by increasing plate spacing and inductance is reduced 
by adding inductors in parallel as indicated in Figure 10-11(c). 
 
Finally, with the addition of more inductors, the inductive portion of the 
circuit becomes a hollow toroid as shown in Figure 10-11(d). The magnetic field is 
concentrated in the toroidal portion of the circuit and the electric field is 
concentrated in the central (capacitive) portion.

Figure 10-11   (aâd) Modification of parallel resonant circuit for operation at microwave 
frequencies. 
 
 
At resonance, energy oscillates back and forth between the toroidal and 
parallel-plate portions of the cavity, just as it does in a parallel LC circuit. By 
replacing the parallel-plate portion of the cavity in Figure 10-11(d) with parallel 
grids, it is possible to pass a low-power electron beam through the center portion. 
 
At high-power levels, the grids cannot be used because they would be 
destroyed by the electron beam. The natural evolution of Figure 10-11(d) is Figure 
10-12(a). To simplify fabrication, the cavity usually takes the shape in Figure 
10-12(b). This type of cavity is referred to as a doubly reentrant cavity. The ends 
of the tubular electron beam tunnels (referred to as the drift tube tips) are the 
reentrant portions of the cavity. The capacitance of the cavity results from the 
energy stored in the electric field between the drift tube tips.

The electric field pattern (dashed lines in Figure 10-12) is not as well defined 
in the gridless cavity as it is in the gridded cavity. Still, the field exists in the 
central region of the cavity and is available for interaction with an electron beam. 
 
The cavities of most klystrons are entirely within the vacuum envelope and 
tubes of this type are referred to as internal cavity klystrons. However, in some 
low-frequency tubes (below S-band), the RF cavities are outside the vacuum 
envelope as indicated in Figure 10-13. These tubes are called external cavity 
klystrons. The cavities are placed onto the tube by the user and may be 
mechanically tuned over a frequency range of 10% to 15%. Advantages of this 
type of construction are that the vacuum structure may be kept small while 
maintaining good cavity-to-beam coupling, and also the tubes can be less 
expensive to replace because the RF cavities are reusable. The disadvantages are 
problems with multipactor (to be discussed in Chapter 24) on the ceramics and RF 
arcing, along with the need to tune the tubes in the field.

10.2.2   Power Coupling 
 
In the drawing of the original Varian klystron (see Section 10.1), small coupling 
loops attached to the ends of coaxial lines are shown for injecting a signal into a 
cavity or taking energy from a cavity. In modern klystrons, either loops or 
waveguide irises are used for coupling energy to a cavity. A typical coupling loop 
is shown in Figure 10-14 and cavity-to-waveguide coupling is shown in Figure 
10-15.

signal into a cavity, an RF current, I1, is injected into the coupling loop as is 
indicated in Figure 10-16. As a result, some magnetic field lines are established 
within and around the coupling loop and some circle through the toroidal portion 
of the cavity. These field lines induce a current flow, I2 in the walls of the cavity. 
The resulting flow of charge produces an electric field, E, across the capacitive 
portion of the cavity. As the RF input current, I1, oscillates, the magnetic field, the 
current, I2, and the electric field, E, are all caused to oscillate. 
 
When energy is extracted from a cavity by a coupling loop, the situation 
described in the previous paragraph is reversed. A modulated electron beam 
passing through the capacitive portion of the cavity induces current, I2, in the walls 
of the cavity. The way in which current is induced is described in Chapter 8. 
Associated with the current, I2, there is a magnetic field within the toroid. A 
portion of the magnetic field links the coupling loop and induces a current, I1, in 
the output coaxial line and, thus, in the load. The direction of the induced current 
is such that it opposes the flux producing the current.

When iris coupling of a waveguide is used, the orientation of the waveguide is 
such that the electromagnetic field propagates directly into the cavity and 
establishes an electric field across the interaction gap. 
 
10.2.3   Tuners 
 
It is essential to be able to adjust the resonant frequencies (tuning) of the cavities 
of a klystron. As was shown in the discussion associated with Figure 10-16, the 
outer donut-shaped region of a cavity is the inductive portion and the region near 
the interaction gap is the capacitive portion. Tuners are used to vary either 
inductance or capacitance. 
 
Two inductive tuners are shown in Figure 10-17. With either the plunger 
shown in the left side of the figure or the diaphragm shown to the right, the 
volume of the cavity can be adjusted. Inductance varies directly with cavity 
volume and thus, as the plunger or diaphragm is pushed into the cavity, the 
inductance is reduced and the resonant frequency is increased. In some plunger-
type tuners, chokes are used to reduce current flow in the tuner. In others, the 
plunger makes electrical contact with a channel surrounding it through spring-
loaded fingers.

Capacitive tuners are shown in Figure 10-18. With these tuners, a paddle-
shaped electrode near the interaction gap is used to vary capacitance. As the 
paddle is moved closer to the gap, capacitance is increased and resonant frequency 
is decreased. For high-power applications, it is sometimes necessary to introduce a 
coolant into the central spindle.

10.2.4   Equivalent Circuits and Circuit Parameters [5] 
 
We showed in Chapter 8 that an electron beam passing through a cavity induces a 
current in the cavity and the beam can be represented by an equivalent current 
generator. In addition, the electron beam has impedance that has a resistive and a 
reactive component. This impedance must be included to accurately model the 
operation of a cavity. First, the equivalent circuit for the cavity will be considered 
and then beam loading can be introduced. 
 
The primary problem is to find parameters that describe the impedance 
characteristics of a cavity at and near resonance. Parameters are needed that will 
determine the voltage and power generated by the induced beam current as a 
function of frequency. Even though a klystron cavity has regions containing 
primarily E fields and those containing primarily H fields, it is difficult to try to 
define capacitances or inductances associated with these regions. Instead, 
parameters can be used, which are defined for lumped constant circuits. These 
parameters can then be defined in terms of fields and energies to describe the 
interaction of the electron beam with the cavity.

Consider the circuit shown in Figure 10-19. The resistance, R, not only 
represents the cavity wall losses but also can include power delivered to an 
external load coupled to the circuit by an inductive coupling loop or through an 
aperture joining the cavity to a waveguide.

These relations for RSH and Q (10-1) and (10-2) have been derived for the 
equivalent circuit of the cavity with lumped circuit elements. Before discussing the 
significance of these relations, it is of value to redefine RSH and Q so that they can 
be used for cavities. The definition of Q (= ÏL/R) can be rewritten as

elements. Finally, the ratio of RSH to Q is

Now, RSH, Q, and Ï are the three quantities which can be used to describe any 
cavity. Also, their definitions can be given in terms of cavity quantities. (As 
indicated in Figure 10-21, U is the peak energy stored and W is the power lost.) 
These quantities are for an unloaded cavity. With a load, the power dissipated in 
the load must be added to W. Then, both RSH and Q are reduced, but their ratio, 
RSH / Q, is a geometrical property of the cavity and remains unchanged.

The value of RSH / Q is a figure of merit for a cavity and is independent of Q 
for any particular cavity geometry. Thus, the shunt impedance, RSH, may be set to 
the value required for matching the external load to the cavity by adjusting the 
loaded Q. This then fixes the Q and, since Q is inversely proportional to the 
bandwidth, the expected frequency response of the cavity (and the klystron) is 
determined. The lower the beam impedance is and the higher the RSH / Q is, the 
wider the bandwidth is. 
 
The RSH / Q of a cavity of the type shown in Figure 10-21 (referred to as a 
reentrant cavity) varies with the dimensions of the cavity as shown in Figure 
10-22. It is possible to obtain values of RSH / Q of over 150. Often, practical 
considerations limit the degree of design freedom for the cavity shape, but an 
RSH / Q of 120 is not normally difficult to obtain [6].

Returning to the effect of the electron beam, we have already mentioned that 
RSH can be controlled to optimize power to the load. There are two cases of 
importance, but in either case, for any given RSH, a large RSH / Q is an advantage 
for bandwidth. Concerning the adjustment of RSH, the two cases of importance are: 
 
 
1. Where the current generator has a small value as is indicated in Figure 
10-23 it can be shown that optimum external loading (and maximum 
power delivery) is for the case where the power dissipated inside the 
cavity is just equal to the power delivered to the external load. In such a 
case, the external loading is equivalent to adding another resistance, RL, 
having the value RL = RSH in parallel with RSH.

2. Under the circumstance indicated in Figure 10-24 when the voltage 
produced across the circuit, V, is greater than the dc beam voltage, Vo, 
electrons passing through the gap may be stopped and turned back, and 
then it is necessary to increase the loading (decrease RL). This will result 
in more power being delivered to RL than to RSH and an optimum 
adjustment of RL can be done empirically by maximizing power to RL. 
Optimum design and performance of klystrons is normally obtained under 
this condition. Under any circumstance, the bandwidth is still optimum 
when RSH /Q is maximum.

10.2.5   RF Cavity Losses 
 
RF losses occur in cavities because of microwave currents flowing in the cavity 
walls. It is important to be able to estimate these losses for at least two reasons: 
 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
254 
 
 
 
1. Adequate cooling for the cavity walls can be provided. 
 
2. The operating power level of the cavity can be limited so that losses do 
not exceed the cooling that has been provided. 
 
One approach to estimating cavity losses has been described by Symons and Jory 
[7, 8]. They have defined a figure of merit, Fm, which relates the square of the 
peak cavity gap voltage (which is a measure of energy stored in the cavity) to the 
power dissipated in the cavity walls. When energy and power are expressed in 
terms of RSH / Q and Qo, it is seen that Fm is invariant as all cavity dimensions are 
scaled with wavelength. This figure of merit is

in which V is peak voltage, PL /A is the loss per unit area, Î´ is the skin depth, Î» is 
the operating wavelength, and Qo is the Q of the cavity with no load attached. 
 
Symons pointed out [8] that not only are the three quantities on the right side 
of this equation invariants for wavelength scaling of a particular cavity geometry, 
but, for klystrons, they vary over extremely limited ranges. In most klystrons, 
RSH / Q â 125, QoÎ´/Î» â 0.8, and A / Î»2 â 1, and so Fm â 100. Now, using this value 
of Fm and the value of Î´ for copper, (10-6) can be rewritten as

(10-7) 
For pulsed devices, the average power loss is the peak power loss reduced by the 
duty cycle, Du. For this relation to be useful in estimating power losses, a value 
must be assigned to the peak voltage, V. This can easily be done in the case of a 
klystron output cavity operating so as to extract maximum power from the electron 
beam passing through it. In that case, the peak voltage across the cavity gap is 
approximately the beam voltage. 
 
Figure 10-25 contains plots of average power loss for various voltages and 
operating wavelengths. The usual cooling capability in klystrons is limited to 
about 1 kW/cm2; however, dissipations in excess of 10 kW/cm2 have been 
demonstrated for use in crossed-field devices. 
 
 
10.3   SMALL SIGNAL OPERATION [5] 
 
In discussing the power output and gain of a klystron and their dependence on 
cavity parameters, it is useful to consider the load to be connected to the cavity 
through a coupling loop as shown in Figure 10-26. The results of the analysis do 
not depend on the particular circuit representation of the external loading, coupling

loop, and so forth. The external load can be coupled to the cavity in any one of 
many ways, for example, with an aperture in the cavity wall, and the load can be 
placed somewhere out in an external waveguide. Also, the load can have a reactive 
component that appears in the equivalent circuit as additional L or C and that 
changes the resonant frequency. All of these require suitable parameters for their 
description, but ultimately they can be reduced to something equivalent to the 
description given here.

10.3.1   Load Representation 
 
In Figure 10-26, LM is the mutual inductance of the cavity and coupling loop and 
RL is a resistive load terminating a transmission line attached to the coupling loop. 
The effect of this external load is to add another resistance, RL', in series with the R 
in the equivalent circuit for the cavity as shown in Figure 10-27. The loss in this 
resistor represents power delivered to the load.

10.3.2   Gain Calculation 
 
When small-signal conditions exist, the gap voltage is considerably less than the 
beam voltage. This was referred to as Case 1 earlier in this chapter. The voltage 
produced at the cavity gap, V, can be written to take into account the effects of the 
load on the shunt resistance, RSHT, (or the total conductance, GT) and the QT 
(loaded) of the cavity as

As shown in Figure 10-29, Î¸ is the drift angle from the modulating cavity to the 
cavity in which current is being induced, M1 as the gap coupling coefficient of the 
modulating cavity and V1 as the voltage at the first cavity. Here beam loading and 
any additional terms due to velocity modulation on the beam as it enters the output 
gap are being ignored. The velocity modulation term is usually small and the beam 
loading can easily be included as an equivalent admittance in parallel with the 
other elements of the equivalent circuit.

Now, power is maximized when GL = GC, that is, when the load resistance 
(considered as a shunt resistance in the equivalent circuit) equals the shunt 
resistance of the cavity. This condition means, of course, that the total power is 
divided equally between internal losses and the external load. We should note here 
that beam loading changes these results only by adding the beam loading 
conductance to the internal losses. 
 
It is also possible to calculate voltage gain using considerations similar to 
those used for power. In most cases, a klystron amplifier has more than two 
cavities. The cavities between the input and output are intended to provide greater 
gain than is possible with just two cavities. The current arriving at gap n due to 
velocity modulation from previous gaps produces a voltage across n which is 
greater than the previous gap voltages. By using several such cavities, we can then 
produce the required maximum current at the output cavity with much smaller 
voltage (and power) input at the first cavity than in the simple two-cavity klystron. 
 
The single-stage voltage gain from cavity m to cavity n can be calculated from 
(10-11) and (10-12). First, we note that, for small values of X, J1(X) â X / 2 so that 
the equation for induced current in gap n becomes

This relation is the single stage gain. As expected, the gain and gain-bandwidth 
product depend on RSH / Q. 
 
 
The typical klystron has several stages. The intermediate cavities between the 
first and the last stages produce extra stages of gain as just described. That 
calculation was simplified because we assumed that the only velocity modulation 
and current that existed at any particular cavity was that due to the velocity 
modulation from the previous cavity. Then we calculated a new voltage produced 
by this current. This is exactly true for the second cavity in a chain. At the third 
cavity, however, the modulation and current will be the sum of two terms: 
 
 
1. A current due to velocity modulation at the first cavity, which then 
produced a current at the third cavity; 
 
2. A current due to the voltage of the second cavity which, in turn, was due 
to the current arriving from the first cavity. 
 
 
There will still be some persistent velocity modulation from two earlier 
cavities, and the current terms will produce voltage on the third cavity, which 
remodulates the beam and continues on to the next. 
 
As a result, as we go up the chain of cavities, we see that the complexity of 
the calculation increases. At each cavity there are currents that depend directly on 
the voltage at some previous cavity through velocity modulation converted into 
current by bunching. In addition, there are terms that contain currents produced by 
voltages at intermediate cavities by currents arriving at earlier cavities. These are 
so-called âfeed-forwardâ terms that make the calculation of klystron performance 
very complex.  
 
The components required for determining gain in a multicavity klystron have 
been illustrated by Symons and Vaughan as shown in Figure 10-30 [9]. Here, gap 
impedances are indicated by Z1, Z2 â¦ where the subscripts indicate cavity 
numbers. The quantities g21, g32, â¦ are transconductances defined by, for 
example,

g   V
=
 
(10-17) 
and I2 is the current induced in cavity two by the voltage, V1, at gap one. The total 
current gain for the five-cavity klystron is given in (10-18). 
 
Thus, the klystron is unlike an ordinary amplifier where the input voltage (or 
current) to one stage is proportional to the output voltage (or current) of the 
previous stage. The klystron behaves like a multistage amplifier gain where there 
are voltages from each stage fed into the stage ahead of them and also fed around 
into the following stages. Another factor that must be considered is that it is often 
desirable to tune the cavities in various ways so that the resonant frequency of 
different cavities is different. In addition, some cavities may be loaded to lower the 
Q and thereby increase the bandwidth.

10.4   POWER OUTPUT CHARACTERISTICS 
 
The discussions up to this point have been for gap voltages very much less than 
the beam voltage (Vn < Vo) so that small signal theory could be applied in 
calculating transit effects, power transfer, and so forth. However, when Vn â Vo, or 
more strictly, when MnVn â Vo, then small-signal calculations, which have assumed 
that the modulated velocity of the electrons in a gap is a small fraction of their 
average velocity, are inaccurate and the calculations for gain or optimum power 
transfer are not valid. 

Basic Klystrons and Their Operation 
 
261 
 
When MnVn â Vo, the average electron velocity is substantially reduced and, in 
fact, some electrons may even have their motion reversed. Empirically, the output 
load is varied until optimum power is delivered. This corresponds to GL > GC so 
that more of the power is delivered to the load than to the output cavity. This 
additional loading will tend to reduce the voltage across the output gap enough so 
that electron motion is not reversed. Instead, many of the electrons will be just 
slowed down to zero velocity as they pass through the gap and will have given up 
all of their energy to the cavity plus loads. Then as much power as possible will 
have been extracted from the electrons. 
 
These conditions apply in all high efficiency-klystrons. High efficiency is 
obtained because most of the energy taken from the electrons is delivered to the 
external load rather than being dissipated in losses in the cavity. To calculate 
optimum power transfer under these conditions, it is necessary to go through a 
numerical computation of electron trajectories through the output gap and find the 
conditions of optimum energy loss by the electrons. Under these circumstances, 
electrons will be passing each other and, in some cases, will be going backwards. 
Highly efficient klystrons operate with these conditions in the output cavity. 
 
10.4.1   Tuning of Conventional Klystrons 
 
Conventional klystrons (not extremely efficient or broadband klystrons) can be 
synchronously tuned, efficiency tuned, or broadband tuned. In all cases, the tubes 
are usually tuned for maximum power output. With synchronous tuning, all 
cavities are tuned to the same frequency and gain is maximized. For 
high-efficiency tuning, a klystron is first synchronously tuned and then the 
penultimate cavity is tuned upward to maximize power. By being tuned upward, 
the penultimate cavity is inductive at the operating frequency and this enhances 
the bunching process at the output cavity (see Chapter 8).  
 
Tuning characteristics of a penultimate cavity are shown in Figure 10-31. 
With a klystron operating at, or near, full output power, it is important not to tune 
the penultimate cavity down in frequency into the shaded region indicated in 
Figure 10-31. This is because there is no load on the penultimate cavity, and the 
voltage induced could be high enough to cause breakdown across the cavity gap. 
 
To broadband tune a klystron, it is first synchronously tune at a low power 
level. Then, as indicated in Figure 10-32, the intermediate cavities are detuned 
downward and upward to achieve the desired bandwidth and gain flatness. The 
bandwidth of the output cavity determines the ultimate bandwidth of the tube. For 
broad bandwidth, a high perveance beam is normally used to achieve low beam 
impedance, which, in turn, results in a low beam-loading impedance in the output 
cavity. Also, bandwidth can be broadened by using an extended interaction 
(multiple-coupled-cavity) output circuit (discussed in Chapter 11).

The center frequency of operation of a klystron can be varied while 
maintaining the desired broadband characteristics by simultaneously tuning all 
cavities. This can be done mechanically with a channel tuner mechanism like that 
illustrated in Figure 10-36. With this mechanism, which is sometimes manually

operated and sometimes motor driven, a gear-coupled drive is used to 
simultaneously change the position of the tuning plunger in all cavities. An 
example of the resulting shift in operating frequency is given in Figure 10-37.

10.4.2   Transfer Characteristics 
 
Transfer characteristics for a klystron are shown in Figure 10-38. As is typical for 
all linear-beam tubes, output power usually varies linearly with drive power at low 
power levels. At high drive levels, there is a point where optimum bunching 
occurs in the output cavity and output power is maximized. Beyond that drive 
level, output power decreases. 
 
When a klystron is broadband tuned, there is significant decrease in gain 
compared with synchronous or efficiency tuning. This is clear from Figure 10-38, 
which shows an increase in drive power of nearly two orders of magnitude 
required for broadband-tuned operation as compared with efficiency-tuned 
operation.

The output power of a klystron (as well as for other microwave tubes) varies 
dramatically with beam voltage as shown in Figure 10-39. This is as expected for 
at least two main reasons. In the first place, beam power, Po, varies as the 5/2 
power of beam voltage, Vo, because

where Io is the beam current and p is perveance. Thus, an increase in beam voltage 
by a factor of 1.5 (as shown in Figure 10-39) is accompanied by an increase in 
beam power of a factor of 2.8. For constant tube efficiency, RF power output 
would go up by the same amount. Efficiency is not constant, however, but 
decreases with decreasing voltage because of changes in beam bunches and 
diameter at voltages below the design voltage.

11.1   HIGH-EFFICIENCY KLYSTRONS 
 
Many calculations of the maximum efficiency for klystrons have been made. 
Mihran et al. [1] predicted an efficiency of 80%. In several Soviet publications, 
predictions in the 80% to 90% range have been made [2â9]. There is no evidence 
that these high efficiencies have been achieved. 
 
Bastien et al. [10] showed the predicted variations of efficiency for low- and 
high-perveance klystrons (see Figure 11-1). Notice that the effects of load 
impedance on output gap voltage and output cavity current are shown. Maximum 
efficiencies occur at the point where electrons are reflected in the output cavity. 
For low perveance, Faillon predicted 70% efficiency, and for high perveance, he 
predicted about 47%.

Kosmahl and Albers [11] computed an efficiency of 80.3% with 6% 
interception. This computation was carried out using a three-dimensional analysis 
of the performance of output gaps in klystrons. Their work (see Figure 11-2) 
showed the variation in efficiency with perveance. Note that efficiency falls 
almost linearly with increasing perveance. Also, interception increases with 
increasing perveance. Kosmahl and Albers also showed the strong dependence of 
efficiency on drift tube diameter in the output cavity. These results, which were 
computed for Mihranâs [1] and Lienâs [12] designs, are shown in Figure 11-3.

In the solar-powered satellite program, Kosmahl [13] predicted that an 
efficiency of 80% or more might be achieved through the use of multistage 
depressed collectors (MSDC). It was predicted that the collector would recover 
from 40â50% of the spent-beam power. The collector efficiency is limited to the 
40â50% range because the electrons in the spent beam have a very large velocity 
spread. Some electrons are barely moving as they leave the output cavity, while 
others have as much as twice the initial beam energy. 
 
The highest overall efficiency reported for a klystron is 74% [12]. This high 
efficiency was achieved in a 50-kW device operating at 2,450 MHz. In the same 
reference, Lien reported an overall efficiency of 70% for an 800-MHz klystron 
with a power of about 70 kW. These efficiencies were achieved without the use of 
depressed collectors. Some of the more significant aspects of this high-efficiency 
work are summarized here.

Perhaps the most important consideration in achieving the efficiencies in [12] 
was the use of second-harmonic bunching to increase the RF beam current. Some 
of the cavity configurations considered for second harmonic bunching are shown 
in Figure 11-4. In narrowband tubes, the combinations of fundamental frequency 
and second harmonic cavities were used. In an alternate approach, applicable to 
broadband devices, an abnormally long drift length was used. In this case, the 
harmonic bunching was produced by second-harmonic space-charge forces within 
the beam rather than with a second-harmonic field. 
 
The electron phase plot for the case of the single second harmonic prebuncher 
shown in Figure 11-5 shows computed trajectories for 32 reference electrons in 
one RF period. In this plot, electrons with dc velocity have trajectories parallel to 
the abscissa. Electrons with a velocity higher than the dc velocity have a negative 
slope and those with velocities lower than the dc velocity have a positive slope. It 
should be noted that the majority of the reference electrons is contained within the 
bunch at the location of the output cavity and that the interbunch region is 
essentially free of electrons. In addition, the velocity spread among the electrons is 
small. 
 
The fundamental and second-harmonic frequency components of beam 
current are shown as functions of normalized distance along the tube in Figure 
11-6. The maximum fundamental current produced by the buncher at the output 
resonator is 1.8 times the dc beam current. Lien noted that higher currents could be 
produced, but the velocity spread among electrons is increased and efficiency is 
not increased.

Output power and efficiency curves for two klystrons using second-harmonic 
cavities are shown in Figures 11-7 and 11-8. The X-3074B operated at about 800 
MHz. This tube had six fundamental-frequency cavities and one second-harmonic 
cavity. The results in Figure 11-8 are for the 2,450 MHz tube, which had two 
second-harmonic cavities in addition to six fundamental-frequency cavities. It 
should be reiterated that these high efficiencies were attained without the use of 
depressed collectors. 
 
Experience with multistage depressed collectors for high-power operation is 
limited to tubes operating at about 100 kW. For example, Varian (now CPI) [14] 
developed klystrons for television service that used multistage depressed 
collectors. Figure 11-9 shows the improvement in efficiency that can be achieved 
with an MSDC on a TV klystron. With a standard collector, these tubes have an 
efficiency up to about 50%. With an MSDC recovering 57% of the spent beam 
power, the overall efficiency becomes 71%. 
 
 
11.2   HIGH-POWER KLYSTRONS 
 
Klystrons are capable of generating microwave power from over a megawatt CW 
to tens or even hundreds of megawatts pulsed. Symons [15] provided a technique 
for estimating the power that should be obtainable. Of course, the RF power is 
primarily dependent on the beam power, which is the product of beam voltage and 
beam current, so it is necessary to determine limits on beam voltage and current in   
order to estimate power capability.

11.2.1   Limits on Beam Voltage 
 
The most obvious limit on beam voltage is the onset of arcing in the electron gun. 
This limit depends on pulse length, as Table 11.1 indicates. Note that hold-off 
voltage decreases with increasing pulse length. Symons pointed out that the use of 
intermediate potential grading electrodes within the gun could make higher 
operating voltages possible.

Other factors, beside gun arcing, limit the operating voltage of a klystron. For 
efficient operation, the voltage across the output gap must be sufficient to remove 
most of the energy from the electron beam as it passes through the gap. This 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
276 
happens when the peak voltage across the output gap is nearly equal to the beam 
voltage. However, arcing can place a limit on gap voltage and, consequently, on 
beam voltage. 
 
There is also a limit imposed on cavity gap voltage by the RF losses in the 
output cavity. These losses are proportional to the square of the cavity gap voltage. 
Also pulsed heating of the cavity surface can lead to cracking and fatigue failure. 
These heating effects were discussed in Chapter 10. Heating as a function of 
cavity voltage and operating wavelength were shown in Figure 10-20. 
 
Kilpatrick [16] proposed a criterion for the onset of RF arcing across gaps and 
Peter et al. [17] proposed the modification

where f is the frequency in megahertz and E is the electric field in megavolts per

It should be noted that Loew and Wang [18] demonstrated an RF breakdown 
limit far above that given by (11-1). Their results were obtained for electron linac 
structures. However, Phillips and Sprehn [19] found that the RF breakdown in 
their high-power klystron work matched well with (11-1). They pointed out that a 
major difference between the klystron and the linac is the presence in the klystron 
of a nearby intense electron beam. They hypothesize that stray electrons or x-ray 
photons strike the cavity walls and initiate breakdown at a relatively low field 
gradient more like that given by (11-1). 
 
The use of (11-1) is simplified by noting that the fields used in high-power 
klystrons are high enough that the exponential term is ~ unity. An approximation 
for the magnitude of the electric field can be found by examining the gap transit 
angle. First of all, the field is related to gap voltage by

By using multiple output cavities, such as those in extended interaction 
klystrons, the voltage across each gap of the output circuit is lower than for a 
single output cavity and both cavity losses and output gap arcing can be reduced. 
As a result, the voltage limits for multiple output klystrons can be much higher 
than for klystrons with single output cavities. 
 
11.2.2   Limits on Beam Current 
 
There are several limits to beam current in a linear-beam tube. The most obvious 
limits are evident in the relation for RF power output, which is

where Î· is efficiency and PÎ¼ is the microperveance of the electron gun. It is very 
difficult to design guns with PÎ¼ > ~2 because of space charge effects on potential 
contours within the guns. Since microperveance is limited and beam voltage is 
limited, beam current is limited. 
 
Symons [15] observed that efficiency is fairly well described by the relation 
 
 
 
= 0.9
0.2 PÎ¼
Î·

(11-7) 
Figure 11-2 very nearly supports this relation. (In their work at SLAC, Phillips and 
Sprehn [19] found a somewhat different relation, however, we will use Symonsâ 
relation here.) 
 
The reason for the variation of efficiency with microperveance is that, as 
perveance is increased, it becomes more difficult to form electron bunches that are 
optimally configured for maximum power extraction from the electron beam. As a 
result, for maximum efficiency, perveance must be limited, which limits beam 
current. 
 
As the frequency of operation of a klystron is increased, other factors come 
into play in limiting beam current. Beam current is JA, that is, the product of 
current density and the cross-sectional area of the electron beam. The area of the 
beam is limited by the drift tunnel radius, which scales with wavelength. Symons 
pointed out that the electron beams in most klystrons have a radius that is 
approximately one-half of a radian of electron transit angle. 
 
The beam current density is the cathode emission density multiplied by the 
area convergence ratio of the gun. For impregnated cathodes and long life, a 
current density of 5 A/cm2 can be obtained with little dependence on pulse length. 
For short pulses, Symons assumed that an oxide coated cathode could be used. The 
emission density, Jc in A/cm2, is given by the empirical relation 
 
 
 
2.61
= 814
 
c

(11-8) 
where Ï is the pulse length in microseconds. 
 
If we assume a maximum area convergence ratio of 200:1, then the obtainable 
beam current density is 1,000 A/cm2 for Ï â¥ 10 Î¼s, 2,600 A/cm2 for Ï = 1 Î¼s, and 
6,300 A/cm2 for Ï = 0.1 Î¼s. 
 
11.2.3   Estimate of Obtainable Power 
 
Regardless of frequency, space charge effects limit perveance and therefore beam 
current and power. By combining (11-6) and (11-7), we find that the dependence 
of RF power on perveance and on voltage is

Figure 11-11   Estimate of obtainable power as functions of wavelength, beam current

1986 IEEE.) 
 
 
The procedure outlined by Symons for establishing the reasonableness of a 
power requirement for a klystron is as follows: 
 
 
1. Find the maximum allowable beam voltage from Table 11.1 and Figure 
11-10. 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
280 
 
2. Using Figure 11-11 or (11-11) and (11-9), see if the desired power can be 
achieved. 
 
As an example, the 10-cm, 50-MW, 6.5 Î¼s klystron used at the Stanford Linear 
Accelerator Center operates at approximately 300 kV and microperveance 2. From 
Figure 11-10, it can be seen that it is operating close to Kilpatrickâs criterion limit 
for RF output gap arcing of about 1011 square volts. The product, Î»2J, for this 
device is about 105 and thus, from Figure 11-11, it is reasonable to expect an 
output power of 50 MW at a microperveance of 2. 
 
There are several possible techniques for developing klystrons with power 
capabilities above those predicted by Symonsâ procedure. As pointed out earlier in 
this section, by using multiple output cavities, output gap voltage and output gap 
arcing can be reduced so there is the possibility of using higher beam voltages.  
 
The use of voltage grading electrodes in the electron gun could make possible 
higher gun voltages. True discussed the use of grading electrodes in the design of a 
1-MV, 1,825-A Pierce gun [20]. Three electrodes were used to limit the voltage 
gradients to less that 200 kV/cm and True said that the gun should operate reliably 
for pulse lengths up to 5 microseconds.  
 
There is considerable effort at the present time to develop multiple beam 
klystrons (discussed later in this chapter). These hold the promise of being able to 
generate extremely high powers because many beams, each operating at a 
microperveance near unity, can be used with the result that the klystron has an 
overall microperveance ~10 or higher. It is possible that a similar increase in 
microperveance can be achieved by using a beam in the form of a flat sheet. 
 
Two outstanding examples of existing high-power klystrons are the 1-MW, 
CW, 352-MHz klystrons manufactured by Thales [21] and the 65-MW, 3.5-Î¼s 
pulse length, 180-pps, S-band klystrons manufactured by the Stanford Linear 
Accelerator Center (SLAC) [21]. The Thales tube, the TH 2089, was built for 
CERN, the European Nuclear Research Center. The weight of the klystron, 
electromagnet, and support structure is 2,400 kg and the dimensions are 4.80 Ã 
1.85 Ã 1.20 meters. 
 
The SLAC tube, the SLAC 5045, is the workhorse of the Stanford Linear 
Collider (SLC). A total of 245 SLAC 5045 klystrons operate in the SLC. Over 600 
of these klystrons have been built at SLAC. The mean time between failures 
(MTBF) is higher than 50,000 hours.  
 
The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center klystron group designed, fabricated, 
and tested high-power klystrons, which range from 477 MHz to 11.424 GHz and 
from 1 MW under continuous operation to 150-MW at a 3-Î¼s pulsewidth. 
Particularly noteworthy are the 150-MW S-band tube and a 75-MW X-band tube. 
 
The operating parameters for the 150 MW S-band tube are listed in Table 11.2 
[22]. The tube has operated at powers greater than 150 MW. The tube uses a two-
cell output cavity to increase efficiency, a scandate cathode, and lossy drift tubes 
to improve stability.

The 75-MW X-band program was established to provide klystrons for SLAC 
version of the Next Linear Collider. Phillips and Sprehn described the 
development efforts for 75-MW solenoid-focused and PPM-focused klystrons 
[19]. The solenoid-focused tube operated at 75 MW and 450 kV with pulse lengths 
up to 1.2 Î¼s  and an efficiency of 50%. The PPM-focused klystron operated at 71 
MW and 463 kV with an efficiency between 53% and 63%. 
 
 
11.3   BROADBAND KLYSTRONS 
 
Traveling wave tubes are usually considered to be broadband amplifiers, while 
klystrons are thought to have narrow bandwidths. To make a correct comparison, 
however, output power must be specified. At power levels up to about a kilowatt, 
TWT bandwidths can exceed an octave because broadband helix circuits are used. 
When the average power level becomes high enough so the coupled-cavity circuits 
must be used, the bandwidth drops considerably and at the 100- to 200-kW level, 
the bandwidth is no wider than about 15% [23]. 
 
In the case of the klystron, the lower the cavity Q is, the wider the bandwidth 
is. The cavity Q, in turn, varies with beam impedance, Ro, which may be related to 
tube operating parameters as follows:

(11-12) 
where Î· is efficiency and p is perveance. As a result, Ro and Q decrease and 
bandwidth increases as PRF and p increase. Within reasonable limits of perveance 
and efficiency (two opposing characteristics), the above relation indicates that it is 
two to three times easier to achieve the same bandwidth at 20 MW than it is at 200 
kW. In fact, there are now klystrons available that deliver 3â10 MW and have a 
bandwidth of 10% or more, while at 100â200 kW, bandwidth is usually limited to 
3% or 4%.

An example of a high-power klystron capable of 10% bandwidth is the 
VA-812C, for which the operating characteristics are given in Table 11.3 [24]. The 
efficiency as a function of frequency is shown in Figure 11-12. Because this tube 
operated at a low frequency, it was very large and this, in turn, made the use of a 
very high perveance beam possible. Also, to achieve the flat broadband response, 
each of the four cavities in the driver section had a different gap length and a 
different loading. Broadbanding of the output circuit was achieved by using a 
triple-tuned circuit. The characteristics of driver and output sections required for 
broad bandwidths are described in the following sections.

Special-Purpose Klystrons 
 
283 
 
At microwave frequencies in the power range from about 200 kW to a few 
megawatts, bandwidths are required that conventional klystrons and TWTs cannot 
provide. As a result, special designs have been developed that make klystrons 
operating at bandwidths of 10% or more possible. The driver sections and the 
output sections of these tubes are discussed in the following sections. 
 
11.3.1   Driver Sections 
 
The driver section of a klystron consists of all of the cavities up to the output 
structure. In conventional narrowband tubes, the driver section usually has only 
three or four cavities and the output structure is a single cavity. In broadband 
klystrons, the driver section may consist of eight to ten or more cavities. In fact, 
for some clustered-cavity klystrons, the use of over 20 cavities in the driver 
section has been suggested. 
 
As pointed out in Chapter 10, when large numbers of cavities are used, the 
interactions between cavities become extremely complex. This is because the 
modulation produced by each cavity is carried to all subsequent cavities by the 
electron beam. For wide bandwidths, the total frequency response of a cavity must 
be considered, not just the response near resonance. The total response depends 
not only on the cavity itself but also on the lengths of the drift tubes on either side. 
This is because the gain depends on the ratio of the RF current produced by a 
cavity to the RF current entering the cavity. However, these RF currents depend on 
the velocity modulation on the beam and on the distances that the beam must 
travel for the velocity modulation to become density modulation. Figure 11-13 
shows the gain pole that occurs near resonance along with a gain dip at a 
frequency that becomes higher as the drift tubes are made longer [25].

In trying to achieve wide bandwidths for driver sections, it is not sufficient to 
simply spread the tuning frequencies of the individual cavities over the desired 
bandwidth. The gain dips must be taken into account, and especially those of the 
cavities tuned to the low end of the band. Those gain dips can be moved to the 
high end of the band by lengthening the associated drift tubes. Also, the cavity Qs 
may be adjusted to help control the overall shape of the composite gain curve. 
 
An example showing the gain curves of seven cavities in a broadband driver 
section is shown in Figure 11-14. Here it is clear that long drift tubes have been 
used on the cavities at the low end of the band. The low-frequency (left-hand) gain 
curves are very broad and resemble, except for the broad resonances produced by 
low Qs, the curve for 90Â° drift tubes in Figure 11-13. The gain dips of these low 
frequency cavities are compensated for by the gain poles of the cavities tuned to 
the high end of the band.

Tube Transmitters, by L. Sivan, New York: Chapman and Hall, 1994. Â© 1994 L. Sivan.) 
 
 
In his report on the design of broadband klystrons, Metivier [26] showed the 
improvement in overall gain performance of an eight-cavity klystron that could be 
achieved with uneven spacings of cavities in the driver section. The cavity 
arrangements that he described are shown in Figure 11-15. Cavity spacings are 
shown along with Qs and frequencies to which the cavities were tuned. 
 
Small-signal gain curves corresponding to the cavity spacings in Figure 11-15 
are shown in Figure 11-16. With evenly space cavities, a large gain dip occurred at 
the low end of the frequency band. By increasing the spacings between cavities 
one and two and between 1 and 3, which were tuned to the low end of the band, 
the gain dips produced by these cavities were moved to the high end of the band. 
There these gain dips compensated for a large gain peak that had previously 
occurred. The overall small-signal gain ripple was reduced to 7 dB, which, with 
the gain compression occurring at saturation, resulted in an overall gain ripple of 
less than 1 dB at constant drive.

In his patent of a high-efficiency broadband klystron [27], Friedlander 
described a klystron in which âthe gain-bandwidth product and amplitude response 
is made flatter by successive intermediate floating cavities downstream of the 
input cavity tuned to successively higher frequencies, and the drift lengths 
between them successively shorter.â The frequencies to which the cavities are 
tuned in Friedlanderâs klystron (called the tapered-drift-length klystron) are 
indicated in Figure 11-17. The drift-length tapering is indicated in Figure 11-18. 
 
 The power output of a tapered-drift-length klystron for a radar system is 
shown in Figure 11-19. This tube has nine buncher cavities and one filter loaded 
output cavity (discussed in the following section) and has a bandwidth of 10%. 
This tube was completely designed using a variety of computer codes. The tube 
met specification âright out of the boxâ (when it was first operated). Minor 
adjustments were made to increase the operating margin.

Other efforts to increase bandwidth are based on the fact that, if a single 
cavity is replaced by a pair of cavities and the gap voltage of each cavity is half the 
gap voltage of the single cavity, then the stored energy in the pair of cavities 
would be half that of the single cavity. The voltage applied to the beam would be 
the same in either case. Because the stored energy has been decreased, Q has been 
decreased and bandwidth has been increased. 
 
In an early effort to increase the bandwidth of a klystron, Chodorow and 
Wessel-Berg used structures resembling sections of TWT circuits in place of the 
cavities normally used in klystrons [28]. These structures are referred to as 
extended interaction structures. The klystron built by Chodorow and Wessel-Berg 
contained three extended interaction structures, each of which was formed by a 
short section of a ring-bar circuit that acted as a half-wave-long resonant circuit. 
The interaction impedance is generally proportional to the length of the circuit, 
resulting in a higher gain-bandwidth product in the tube. This tube demonstrated 
an improvement in bandwidth over conventional cavity-type tubes that existed at 
that time without any sacrifice in efficiency. 
 
The most common form of extended interaction structure contains klystron-
like cavities coupled together by slots in the adjacent cavity walls. Symons et al. 
showed, in the clustered-cavity klystron, that the coupling slots between cavities 
are not necessary [29, 30]. In fact, Symons pointed out that the coupling between 
cavities in an extended interaction structure introduces a zero in the response 
between the poles associated with the individual cavities. This zero places 
constraints on tuning and loading that are not present when the zero is eliminated 
by eliminating the coupling. Figure 11-20 gives a comparison of a conventional 
stagger-tuned klystron with a clustered-cavity klystron.  
 
The cavity clusters can take on any one of a variety of configurations as 
indicated in Figure 11-21. In each of the clusters, the gaps of the cavities are close 
enough together so that there is essentially no gain between them. They are each 
driven by essentially the same current that was generated by the bunching at the 
previous cavities. Not only are the gap voltages essentially equal, but also because 
they are excited by the same bunch, they are in exactly the right phase relationship 
to cooperate in exciting a new bunch on the beam. Therefore, the cavity cluster 
acts as if it was a single cavity with half the capacitance and Q (for two cavities) or 
one-third the capacitance and Q (for three cavities) of a single cavity and a total 
voltage equal to the voltage for a single cavity. 
 
Figure 11-22 shows the calculated small-signal gain of a prototype 4-MW 
cluster-cavity klystron. In this plot, Symons and Vaughan illustrated the necessity 
of including velocity currents in the calculation of performance. The total current 
density in the electron beam is the product of charge density and velocity,

Usually, as we did in Chapter 8, only the Ïuo term is used in calculating 
induced currents because the other term (the velocity current term) is considered to 
be negligible. Symons and Vaughan showed that, for their designs, the velocity 
term is not negligible. Notice that the bandwidth in Figure 11-22  exceeds 10% 
and that the gain ripple is very small.

11.3.2   Output Sections 
 
The output section is normally designed to provide optimum coupling from the 
beam to the load for best efficiency. Impedance characteristics of some output 
sections are shown in Figure 11-23. The simplest output circuit consists of a 
standard reentrant cavity with an iris or loop coupling into waveguide or coaxial 
line.

The double-tuned cavity consists of a conventional reentrant cavity coupled to 
the beam along with a filter cavity between this cavity and the load as shown in 
Figure 11-24. The equivalent circuit for the double-tuned cavity is given in Figure 
11-25. Both cavities are tuned to the same frequency and the combination makes it 
possible to load the structure so that optimum impedance occurs at the gap over a 
greater bandwidth than with a single cavity.

The shape of the impedance profile (as a function of frequency) depends on 
the coupling between cavities as shown in Figure 11-26. As would be expected, 
for light coupling, the impedance presented to the beam is similar to that for a 
single cavity without the filter cavity. For heavy coupling, the response has two 
peaks centered on the resonant frequency. In between, there is a coupling that 
produces the maximum bandwidth-efficiency product. 
 
Triple-tuned circuits are sometimes used. These consist of two filter cavities 
between the load and the cavity which couples to the beam. The VA-812C 
discussed early in this chapter, which had a bandwidth in excess of 10%, used a 
triple-tuned output circuit. A comparison of the impedance profile for a triple-
tuned circuit with those for a single cavity and for a double-tuned circuit is shown 
in Figure 11-27. Compared with the double-tuned circuit, the impedance of the 
triple-tuned circuit is flatter over a wider bandwidth.

Extended interaction circuits, which were discussed briefly in the previous 
section, are often used as output sections on klystrons. The impedance 
characteristic of an extended interaction structure is shown in Figure 11-23. An 
extended interaction structure consists of heavily coupled cavities as shown in 
Figure 11-28. In one mode of operation, the fields in all cavities are in phase and 
the electron transit angle between gaps is 2Ï radians. The other common mode of 
operation is similar to the fundamental backward wave mode of coupled-cavity 
TWT operation. That is, the fields in adjacent cavities are approximately 180Â° out 
of phase.

In comparing an extended interaction resonator with a single-gap output 
cavity, the bandwidth is, of course, increased. Perhaps more important is the fact 
that the power-handling capability is increased. This is because the total output 
voltage, which must be applied across a single gap in a conventional klystron, is 
divided among the output cavities of the extended interaction structure. The 
high-power capability of the extended interaction structure was perhaps best 
illustrated by a 1-MW average-power X-band device that used a five-gap coupled-
cavity resonator like that shown in Figure 11-28 [31].

The cloverleaf structure in Figure 11-29 is sometimes used as the output 
section for a klystron as shown in Figure 11-30. The cloverleaf structure is a 
fundamental forward wave circuit that is used in high-power traveling wave tubes 
[32]. Fundamental forward wave TWT circuits are discussed in Chapter 15. When 
the cloverleaf structure is used as the output section of a klystron, the tube is called 
a twystron. 
 
 
To help increase the bandwidth of a twystron, a high-perveance beam is 
used to provide strong beam loading. With this circuit and beam combination, the 
low gain of the TWT section at band edges is offset by the relatively high gain of 
the stagger-tuned-klystron driver section. The overall result, as Figure 11-31 
indicates, can be a very flat gain over a bandwidth of up to 15%. The resulting 
power output as a function of frequency is also very flat, as shown in Figure 
11-32. Twystrons with peak-power outputs up to at least 10 MW have been built. 
Average powers over 30 kW are available and can be increased about an order of 
magnitude before circuit losses and interception present fundamental limitations.

11.4   MULTIPLE BEAM KLYSTRONS 
 
Conventional single-beam klystrons can produce extremely high powers at high 
efficiency and with bandwidths of 10% or more. However, they have the 
disadvantage that microperveance is limited to a maximum value of ~2 and must 
be ~0.5 for high efficiency. Because of these relatively low values of 
microperveance, beam currents are relatively low and very high voltages are 
required if high power and high efficiency are to be obtained. 

Special-Purpose Klystrons 
 
295 
 
By using a device containing multiple electron beams, each one of which has 
a microperveance of ~1 or less, the total microperveance can be increased by as 
much as an order of magnitude or more, while, at the same time, efficiency can be 
optimized. For a given power level, as perveance is increased, beam current is 
increased, and beam voltage is decreased. Thus, the primary advantages of using 
multiple beam klystrons (MBKs) are the reduction in voltage that occurs and the 
ability to optimize efficiency. 
 
In addition, because voltage is reduced, the length of the device is reduced. 
Because the individual beam currents are reduced, the magnetic field required for 
focusing is reduced. As a result of these two factors, for a given power level, the 
weight of the  MBK  is much less that the weight of a single beam klystron. Other 
advantages resulting from the use of MBKs are that power supplies are smaller, 
arcing and breakdown are reduced, it may be possible to use air insulation rather 
than oil, and x-ray shielding can be reduced or eliminated.  
 
Apparently, the concept of the MBK was first proposed in the U.S.S.R. (now 
Russia) by Kovalenko [33] and in France by Bernier [34]. Then, in the 1960s, 
several versions of multiple beam klystrons (MBKs) were reported [35, 36]. Some 
results of the feasibility study in [35] are shown in Figures 11-33 and 11-34. For 
flexibility and convenience, Boyd et al. used conventional external cavity 
klystrons and inserted them into multiwavelength waveguides to test the basic 
principles of the MBK. 
 
Four-beam and 10-beam configurations of MBKs were tested. The four-beam 
MBK is shown in Figure 11-33. The waveguides were operated in the Ï/2 mode, 
which ensured that the voltages at the interaction gaps of the individual tubes were 
the same. Loading capacitors were placed at the positions of the voltage nulls to 
help prevent interference from adjacent modes in the waveguides.  
 
Test results for the 10-beam MBK are shown in Figure 11-34. The upper 
curve represents the 10-beam MBK performance and the lower curve represents 
the average performance of the single-beam klystrons. The authors concluded 
from this study that the MBK has the gain, efficiency, bandwidth, and stability 
characteristics of conventional klystrons. However, the power output of the MBK 
can be made to exceed that of the prototype klystron by a factor equal to the 
number of beams used. 
 
While the work of Boyd et al. showed the feasibility of the MBK, it was not 
pursued in the United States. However, in the early 1960s, MBK designs 
developed by Zusmanovsky [37] and Korolyov [38] led the way for the rapid 
growth of MBK work in Russia. Now MBKs are used in a majority of new, 
prospective mobile ground-based airborne- and space-based radar and 
communication systems in Russia [39].

MBKs can be classified by the geometry of their resonators [39]. Fundamental 
mode (FM) resonators are shown in Figure 11-35. These may have toroidal or ring 
configurations. A higher-order mode (HM) resonator is shown in Figure 11-36. 
Boyd et al. used a linear version of this resonator [35].

Advantages of the fundamental mode (FM) resonator are: 
 
 
1. Large instantaneous bandwidth (TM01 mode);  
 
2. Very low voltage because of the large number of beams that can be used. 
 
Disadvantages of the FM resonator are: 
 
 
1. Cathode loading may be high because beams are close together and so the 
cathode diameter is limited. 
 
2. Because of high cathode loading, life may be severely limited. 
 
 
The basic configuration of an FM MBK is shown in Figure 11-37 [40]. In this 
case toroidal resonators are shown. The control electrode, which is used to 
modulate the beam currents, may in practice be as simple as a flat plate containing 
holes for the beams to pass through. No convergence of the electron beams near 
the cathode assembly is shown, although electron guns with a relatively small area 
convergence ratio are sometimes used.  
 
In [39] an excellent overview is given of the range of capabilities of Russian 
FM MBKs. Devices capable of RF powers from watts (in miniature MBKs) to 
hundreds of kilowatts are described. Emission densities as high as 30 A/cm2 are 
mentioned along with lifetimes of thousands of hours. 
 
 Figures 11-38 and 11-39 show predicted parameters of MBKs operating at 10 
GHz with a cathode emission density of 15 A/cm2 [40]. Notice that a 100-kW 
device containing 19 beams would operate at 10 kV. By comparison, a single-
beam klystron that produced 100 kW would have to operate at 30 kV or more.

The higher-order mode (HM) resonator MBK overcomes some of the 
limitations of the FM MBK but has other restrictions. The advantages of the HM 
resonator are: 
 
 
1. Cathode loading is low because beam separation can be large so cathode 
size can be much larger than for FM devices. 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons

2. Operation at very high average power levels is possible because of the 
large separation between beams and the improved cooling that is possible. 
 
The disadvantages of the HM resonator are: 
 
 
1. Bandwidth is narrow because of the RF circuit that is used.  
 
2. It is increasingly difficult to focus beams as the distance from the center 
of the magnetic field increases. This increases the difficulty in fabricating 
electron guns. 
 
 
The difficulty in beam focusing arises because of the radial components of 
magnetic flux that exist near and in the electron guns as well as in the drift space 
along the length of the klystron. As shown in Figure 11-40, this field component 
causes theta-directed forces on the electron beams. The resulting effect on the 
beams is shown in Figure 11-41.

Bastien et al. [41] analyzed the radial flux distribution in an electromagnet 
without pole pieces and found that Br is proportional to the distance from the 
magnet axis and to the square of the magnet radius. For this reason, cavities with 
drift tubes packed as closely as possible to the magnet axis should be used and the 
radius of the magnet should be as small as possible. 
 
 For the electromagnet to be used on an MBK, Bastien et al. used pole pieces 
on the ends of the magnet and also, to reduce Br to an acceptable level, divided the 
electromagnet into separate coils and used pole pieces between the coils.

1989.) 
 
 
When magnetic flux is required in the guns of an MBK to permit confined 
(immersed) flow focusing, the problem of radial flux components in the guns and 
within the apertures in the pole pieces becomes particularly severe. This problem 
is illustrated in Figure 11-42 [42]. In Figure 11-42(a), the field pattern that would 
exist in a gun of an MBK is shown if no attempt was made to eliminate the radial 
components of flux. In Figure 11-42(b), the desired flux distribution is shown. A 
technique for obtaining the desired flux distribution is shown in Figure 11-43. The 
asymmetry of the pole piece provides a magnetic reluctance configuration that 
eliminates Br. 
 
An application for MBKs that will require very high-power levels is the 
TESLA Linear Collider at Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) [43]. The 
requirement to use MBKs came about when the specifications for the RF sources 
were established. The power requirement per tube was set at 10 MW at an 
efficiency of 70%. The pulse length requirement was 1.5 ms. Reaching this goal 
with a single-beam klystron would require a beam voltage of 241 kV. Quoting 
from [43]: âThe construction of a klystron meeting these parameters seems to be 
impossible. The solution to this problem is the use of several low perveance beams 
in parallel at lower voltage in one vacuum vessel. This technology is utilized in the 
multi beam klystron.â

Because the frequency of operation of TESLA is relatively low (1.3 GHz), 
device dimensions are large enough that either FM or HM MBKs could be 
considered to fulfill the RF source requirements. Figure 11-44 from 
Communications and Power Industries (CPI) indicated that the cathode emission 
density for the FM configuration would be excessive if long life was to be 
achieved. Because the CPI goal was a design for which emission density could be 
limited to 2 A/cm2 to ensure long life, the HM configuration was chosen for its 
development effort.

Thales chose the FM configuration for their device and have delivered several 
tubes to DESY. The cathode emission density is 5.5 A/cm2 and the device has 
been operating at nominal performance level for 6 years (for an overview, see  
[44]). The power output of the Thales tube (the TH 1801) is shown in Figure 
11-45 and the measured performance characteristics are listed in Table 11.4. 
 
The Thales tube illustrates very well the benefits of the MBK. With a beam 
voltage only a little over 100 kV, a power of 10 MW is generated at an efficiency 
of 65%. An additional benefit that the multiple beam and low voltage parameters 
provide is reduced device size. Still, as shown in the outline drawing in Figure 
11-46 of the Toshiba E3736 MBK, which is also being developed for TESLA, the 
device size is substantial. This is because of the relatively low operating frequency 
and the high-power requirement. 
 
The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory is developing a 3.27-GHz MBK for 
beam transport and beam-wave interaction studies (Figure 11-47) [45]. This is an 
eight-beam four-cavity device operating in the fundamental mode. The gun is 
magnetically shielded and operates at 32A and 45 kV. Detailed results of 
calculations of electron energies, RF current, and power are given in [45]. 
 
A PPM-focused S-band MBK has been developed to produce 120â160 kW 
with a bandwidth of 10% [46]. The device uses 18 beams at 16 kV in a 
fundamental mode RF system. M-type cathodes operating at an emission density 
of 13â15 A/cm2 are used to obtain a life of more than 1,000 hours. A control 
electrode at a bias voltage of â5.5 to â6 kV is used to modulate the electron beams. 
It is thought that the dc beam transmission has been limited to about 90% because 
of: (1) misalignment between the electron gun and the RF interaction region; and 
(2) nonuniform magnetic field at different beam locations.

11.5   EXTENDED INTERACTION KLYSTRONS 
 
Extended interaction klystrons (EIKs) may be amplifiers (EIAs) or oscillators 
(EIOs). These devices are used at millimeter-wave frequencies to help overcome 
the difficulties of reducing the dimensions of conventional klystrons so that they 
can operate at these frequencies. A cross-sectional view of an EIA is shown in 
Figure 11-48.

In extended interaction devices, each cavity of the conventional klystron is 
replaced by a section of resonant slow wave circuit. This circuit, which is referred 
to as a ladder structure, often contains long and short slots as shown in Figure 
11-49. The electron beam passes through a hole in the center of the circuit and 
interacts with the RF wave on the structure as shown in Figure 11-50.

The interaction of the electron beam with the ladder structure is identical to 
that occurring in a coupled-cavity traveling wave tube and is described in Chapter 
15. Upon entering the ladder structure, some electrons experience an accelerating 
field and others experience a decelerating field. The accelerated electrons catch up 
with the decelerated electrons to form bunches. If the bunch velocity is somewhat 
higher than the phase velocity of the circuit wave, energy transfer to the circuit 
occurs and the RF signal is amplified. 
 
Because the beam voltage is high and the beam current is low (compared with 
lower-frequency devices), the beam impedance is relatively high. As a result, to 
achieve reasonably high gain and high power, it is necessary to use a circuit with 
high interaction impedance and that is a characteristic of the ladder structure. The 
bandwidth, however, is fairly narrow as indicated in Figure 11-51 for a 140-GHz 
device. Here, at 1 dB below maximum power, the bandwidth is 0.16%.  
 
The dimensions of the circuit in an EIA such as the 94-GHz device described 
in [47] can be readily estimated. The RF fields in adjacent slots are about 180Â° out 
of phase. The beam voltage is 16 kV and the electrons travel at one-fourth of the 
speed of light. The electrons must reach adjacent slots every half cycle, so, at 95 
GHz, the slot spacing is 
 
 
 
c
slot spacing = 0.25  
 = 0.395 mm = 0.0156 inch
2 f
 
(11-14) 
The average slot length is about a half wavelength long or 1.6 mm (0.064 inch). 
The beam radius is 0.125 mm (0.005 inch) and the beam focusing flux density is 
10,000 Gauss. 
 
The EIA for which the RF power characteristic is shown in Figure 11-52 was 
developed for use in the 94-GHz cloud profiling radar on NASAâs CloudSat 
Program [48]. This EIA is the first space-qualified high-power W-band amplifier. 
The device uses a single-stage depressed collector to help achieve an overall 
efficiency of 32%. The high area convergence ratio of the gun, which is 100:1, 
makes possible low cathode loading and an operational life of over 2 years.

The extended interaction oscillator is a single-cavity device as shown in 
Figure 11-53. The cavity can be mechanically tuned over a bandwidth of about 
4%. A schematic of an EIO is shown in Figure 11-54. The EIO can be CW or 
pulsed using a cutoff grid. With proper design and low gas content, both the EIO 
and the EIA have very good phase noise performances [49]. Figure 11-55 contains 
plots of noise characteristics of several EIKs.

11.6   REFLEX KLYSTRONS 
 
A reflex klystron is a single-cavity oscillator. As shown in Figure 11-57, an 
electron beam passes through a cavity gap (normally gridded) into a region where 
the negative voltage on a repeller (reflector) electrode causes the electrons to 
reverse direction.

Assuming that a signal exists across the cavity grids, then the electron beam is 
velocity modulated as described in previous chapters. As the electron beam drifts 
into the repeller region, bunching occurs as indicated in Figure 11-58. If the 
bunched electrons return to the modulating gap at the correct time, they induce a 
current that reinforces the current in the cavity. Thus, the electron beam provides 
the feedback loop that causes the device to oscillate. 
 
In Figure 11-58, the phase, Î±, at which the electron bunch returns to cause 
oscillations is 2.75 cycles after the beam initially passed through the bunching 
cavity. By changing the repeller voltage, the phasing of the return of the electrons 
to the modulating cavity can be changed. As a result, the electron bunch can be 
caused to return to the modulating gap 2.75, 3.75, 4.75 cycles, and so forth after 
initially passing through it. As indicated in Figure 11-59, oscillations can occur in 
any one of several modes that correspond to the phase angle through which the 
signal changes as the electrons drift through the repeller region.

As also indicated in Figure 11-59, the oscillation frequency in any mode of 
operation is a function of the time that it takes the electron bunch to return in that 
mode. For example, if the repeller voltage is above the mode-center value, then the 
electron transit time is less than the mode-center value, and the frequency is above 
the mode-center value. As a result, the RF current induced in the cavity is at a 
frequency above the resonant frequency of the cavity (mode-center frequency), so 
the frequency of operation is above the resonant frequency. Power output is 
reduced because operation off resonance reduces the cavity impedance and gap 
voltage. 
 
Reflex klystrons are low-power (usually less than a watt) devices that have 
historically been used as local oscillators. They are low noise devices that are not 
difficult to phase lock.

Traveling Wave Tubes 
 
 
12.1   INTRODUCTION 
 
The traveling wave tube (TWT) is one of two major categories of microwave 
devices known as linear-beam or O-type tubes. The other is the klystron. While 
many different RF circuits have been devised for use in TWTs, two predominate. 
These are: 
 
 
1. Helix, for broadband applications; 
 
2. Coupled-cavity, for high-power applications. 
 
Other TWT circuits are mentioned in this book, but the majority of the discussions 
center on helix and coupled-cavity TWTs. 
 
Traveling wave tubes are used from frequencies below 1 GHz to over 100 
GHz. Power generation capabilities range from watts to megawatts. For helix 
TWTs, bandwidths may be as high as 2 octaves or more. For coupled-cavity 
TWTs, bandwidths in the 10â20% range are common. 
 
Over 50% of the sales volume of all microwave tubes are for TWTs. 
Applications for TWTs are varied. They serve as the final amplifiers in most 
electronic warfare systems. In many radar systems, one or more TWTs are used as 
the high-power amplifier that generates the transmitted RF pulse. In others, a TWT 
may be used as the driver for some other device such as a crossed-field amplifier. 
They are the final amplifiers of choice in a large percentage of communications 
satellites and systems. Of particular note is the performance of the X-band TWT 
on the Voyager I satellite, which was still in operation after 28 years in space. This 
TWT was the backup for the solid-state amplifier that failed early in the mission. 
 
12.1.1   Early History of the TWT [1] 
 
The possibility of a traveling wave interaction between an electron beam and a 
nearby RF circuit was recognized in 1933 by Haeff [2, 3]. In patents filed in that 
year, Haeff described electron beam deflection tubes to be used as detectors or 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
318 
oscillographs that contained some of the features of helix traveling wave tubes. In 
the Haeff devices, an RF signal propagating on a helical structure was used to 
deflect a nearby hollow electron beam transverse to the direction of beam 
propagation. The velocity of the electron beam was equal to the velocity of 
propagation of the traveling wave on the helical structure. The possibility of 
amplification was pointed out. 
 
In 1935, Posthumus [4] first described and built a cavity-type magnetron 
oscillator. He explained its operation as being due to an interaction between the 
tangential component of a traveling RF wave rotating with a velocity equal to that 
of the average velocity of the electrons. As a result of the interaction, electron 
energy is converted to amplification of the RF wave. 
 
In May 1940, Lindenblad [5] was the first to describe helix traveling wave 
amplifiers that were similar to a helix traveling wave tube. He was the first to 
explain that a synchronous axial interaction between an electron beam and the RF 
wave on a helix could produce amplification of a signal on the helix. In a form of 
the tube described in the patent and shown schematically in Figure 12-1, 
Lindenblad produced useful amplification over a 30-MHz band at a carrier 
frequency of 390 MHz. In this tube the signal was applied to the beam with a grid 
in the gun. In other experiments, the signal was applied to the helix.

The first Lindenblad tube was apparently a modified version of Haeffâs 
inductive output tube. Lindenblad extended the glass vacuum envelope of the 
Haeff tube and replaced the cavity resonator with a helix. The helix was wound 
around the outside of the glass envelope and had a pitch such that the axial 
velocity of a wave on the helix was equal to the velocity of an electron beam 
inside the envelope. It is interesting that Lindenblad recognized the value of 
tapering the pitch of the helix to maintain synchronism with the electron beam, the

velocity of which is reduced as energy is extracted to produce amplification. 
 
In his patent, in addition to the helix, Lindenblad described the use of a helical 
waveguide as the slow wave circuit. He also stated that the helical conductors can, 
if desired, be placed within the envelope of the tube and surround the electron 
beam. 
 
Kompfner [6â10], working in England, was apparently unaware of 
Lindenbladâs earlier work. He reported that he realized in late 1942 (shortly after 
Lindenbladâs patent was issued) that the basic growing wave principle of the 
magnetron could be used for amplification of RF signals. His objective was to 
develop an amplifier capable of a sensitivity and noise figure comparable to the 
best of the crystal-mixer receivers available at that time. Shown in Figure 12-2 is 
Kompfnerâs first sketch of a traveling wave tube.

Invention of the Traveling Wave Tube by R. Kompfner, copyright 1963 by San Francisco 
Press, reproduced with permission.) 
  
 
Kompfner built his first traveling wave tube in early 1943. He summarized the 
operation of the tube as follows: 
 
 
âWhen the radio frequency power emerging from the helix with the beam 
switched on was compared with the radio frequency power without the 
beam, it was found that, at a beam voltage of 2440 volts, there was an 
increase of 49%, while at a beam voltage of 2200 volts, there was a 
decrease of 40%.â 
 
 
After various measurements and experiments, Kompfner built and tested the 
tube shown in Figure 12-3. With an electron beam current of 110 Î¼A at 1,830V a 
power amplification of 6 was achieved at a frequency of 3.3 GHz. The noise factor 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
320 
was 14 dB and was observed to depend on the fraction of the total current that 
arrived at the collector electrode. A further improvement in design increased 
power amplification to 14 and reduced noise factor to 11 dB. In theoretical studies 
completed before 1944, Kompfner developed first-order theories for power 
amplification and noise factor. The important result was that the wave tends to 
grow exponentially with distance along the transmission line. 
 
The first public announcement of the British wartime work on helix traveling 
wave tubes was made at the Fourth Institute of Radio Engineerâs Electron Tube 
Conference at Yale on June 27 and 28, 1946. At the same conference, work in the 
United States by J. R. Pierce and L. M. Field at Bell Telephone Laboratories was 
described. Subsequently [11], Pierce and Field described helix traveling wave 
tubes like that shown in Figure 12-4 (figure taken from Patent 2,602,148 by J. R. 
Pierce [12]). One unique feature of this device, described by Pierce, was the use of 
longitudinal insulating rods for supporting and accurately positioning the helix. 
Another was the use of a system of solenoids to produce a uniform magnetic field 
for focusing the electron beam. Pierce also described techniques for providing loss 
to suppress backward traveling waves and oscillations.

In the patent by Field [13] the suppression of oscillations through the use of 
thin layers of colloidal graphite on the ceramic support rods for the helix is 
described. Near the midpoint of the helix, the conductivity of the coating was 
increased to provide the proper dissipation of reflected energy with a minimum of 
reduction in the gain of the forward growing wave. 
 
During the postwar years from 1946 to 1950, there was intense activity in the 
development of adequate theories to explain the operation of the TWT. In addition 
to Pierceâs theoretical work [14], noteworthy contributions [15, 16] were made by 
A. Blanc-Lapierre and P. Lapostolle in France in December 1946 that contained an 
analysis of traveling wave interaction using a structure consisting of resonant 
cavities coupled by axially aligned apertures. 
 
It seems appropriate to conclude this brief early history by citing [17]. This 
book provided a unified coordination and exposition of the theory of the traveling 
wave tube and has been used as the standard reference for the theory of traveling 
wave tubes ever since. 
 
12.1.2   Basic Operation of the TWT 
 
There are two basic types of TWTs. The helix TWT, the main elements of which 
are shown in Figure 12-5, is a relatively low-power (usually tens to hundreds of 
watts) broadband (over 2 octaves is possible) device. The coupled-cavity TWT is 
capable of powers of megawatts, but bandwidth is limited to about 10â20%. 
Conceptually, the electron gun, electron beam, and collector are the same for all 
TWTs. However, there are substantial differences in the RF circuits. In spite of the 
differences, the operating principles are the same. We will discuss the operation of 
the helix TWT here.

For the helix TWT, it is helpful in explaining the RF behavior to first consider 
a single-wire transmission line above a ground plane as shown in Figure 12-6.

322 
Charges on the transmission line and the RF electric field pattern are shown at an 
instant in time. The RF magnetic field pattern is not shown and will not be 
considered because the RF magnetic forces on the electron beam in a microwave 
tube are insignificant compared with the forces produced by the electric field. If 
the RF generator is on the left end of the transmission line in Figure 12-6 and if a 
matched load is on the right end, then the charge and field patterns move to the 
right with constant amplitude. The velocity of propagation is that of light and is 
independent of frequency. 
. 
 
Figure 12-6   RF charge and electric field patterns for a single-wire transmission line above 
a ground plane. 
 
 
Next, assume that the single-wire transmission line is formed into a helix as 
shown in Figure 12-7. An RF signal applied to the left end of the helix will travel 
at a velocity near that of light in a helical path along the conductor. The average 
velocity in the axial direction, which is called the phase velocity (usually denoted 
by vp) of the helix, will be the velocity in the helical direction reduced by the pitch 
of the helix. The polarity of the signal will alternate every half-wavelength along 
the helical conductor. In Figure 12-7, two complete turns are required for each 
half-wavelength. 
 
Electric field lines extend from regions of positive charge to regions of 
negative charge with a configuration similar to that shown for the transmission 
line in Figure 12-6. Other than the reduced velocity, the primary difference 
between the field pattern for the helix and that for a single-wire transmission line 
is that there is an electric field inside the helix with large axial components 
 
When an electron beam is injected along the axis of the helix, the axial 
electric field components accelerate some electrons and decelerate others. In 
Figure 12-7, the forces on the electrons would be toward regions A and away from 
regions B. The field pattern would vary sinusoidally in the axial direction, as 
indicated in Figure 12-8. If the axial velocity of the electric field and the beam are 
nearly the same, then electrons will experience a continual force toward region A 
as the beam travels through the helix. As a result, an electron bunch will start to 
form in region A (also indicated in Figure 12-8(a)).

The bunches that form in the beam repel electrons on the helix causing those 
electrons to travel to the right and to the left. The electrons on the helix travel at 
the phase velocity, vp, of the helix which is nearly the same velocity as the electron 
bunches in the beam. Relative to a bunch, electrons on the left move left at 2vp. 
This produces a deficiency of electrons, which makes the circuit positive.  
 
Relative to the bunch, electrons on the right, which are moving at 
approximately the bunch velocity, are nearly standing still. As a result, electrons 
accumulate ahead of the bunch and make the circuit negative.

The increase in electron charge ahead of the bunch and decrease behind the 
bunch produces a voltage waveform on the helix as is shown in Figure 12-8(b) that 
is phase shifted 90Â° to the left of the initial waveform. As the voltage waveform on 
the helix shifts to the left, decelerating field regions move into the regions where 
the bunches are located. As more and more electrons are forced into the bunch, the 
induced waveform rapidly becomes larger than the initial waveform so the RF 
power on the circuit increases.  
 
The initial bunching action in a TWT is like that produced by a gap (fast 
electrons catch up with slow electrons to produce a bunch). However, when the 
field shift shown in Figure 12-8(b) occurs, only decelerating forces are present, so 
electrons are slowed down but not accelerated. As a result, bunches are formed 
that move more slowly than the electron beam. 
 
The fundamental aspects of the propagation of these bunches can be 
understood by considering an analogy with acoustic-wave propagation. In Figure 
12-9(a), back-to-back acoustic transducers launch acoustic pressure (and density) 
waves in the air. The waves result from motion of the diaphragms in the 
transducers, which periodically compress the air. The waves propagate to the right 
and to the left at a velocity that is dependent on air pressure. With increased 
pressure, wave velocity increases.

In Figure 12-9(b), a grid is shown inserted in an electron cloud that is not 
moving. We will assume that the grid does not collect electrons. As the voltage on 
the grid oscillates from positive to negative and back to positive again, electrons 
are attracted, then repelled and then attracted again. As a result, the electron 
density near the grid is alternately reduced and increased and electron density 
waves are launched to the right and to the left. The velocities of these waves are 
dependent on the electron density. With increased density, wave velocities 
increase. These electron density waves are called space charge waves. 
 
Next, let the electron column move to the right at a velocity that is much 
higher than the velocities of the space charge waves. The moving electron column 
is, of course, an electron beam. Both space charge waves are moving to the right 
with the beam. One is moving faster than the beam and is called a fast space 
charge wave. The other is moving slower than the beam and is called a slow space 
charge wave. The bunches produced by the decelerating field in Figure 12-8(b) 
constitute a slow space charge wave. 
 
The energy extracted from the electron beam in slowing electrons to the 
bunch velocity is transferred to the circuit field, thereby producing amplification 
of that field. The mutual interaction of the beam and circuit result in an 
exponential growth of the circuit voltage as shown by the left half of the 
waveforms in Figure 12-10. 
 
As the interaction process continues, more electrons are slowed to the bunch 
velocity and space charge forces within the bunches continue to increase. 
Eventually, these forces become large so that a portion of each bunch is retarded in 
phase enough so that it leaves the decelerating field region and enters an 
accelerating field (see electron density plots in the right third of Figure 12-10). 
Electrons in the acceleration portion of each bunch extract energy from the circuit 
field. Eventually, as the bunches continue to fall back in phase, energy extracted 
from the circuit wave becomes equal to the energy supplied and the wave on the 
circuit stops growing. At this point, âsaturationâ is said to occur and the signal 
amplitude is maximum. 
 
 
12.2   TRAVELING WAVE INTERACTION  
 
There are many approaches to the analysis of the interaction of an electron beam 
with a traveling wave on a circuit. The classical small-signal theory by J. R. Pierce 
[17] is a logical extension of the qualitative description of traveling wave 
interaction given here. Also, many of the parameters defined by Pierce are now 
part of the accepted vocabulary of the TWT industry. For these reasons and 
because the Pierce theory provides considerable physical insight into the 
mechanisms of TWT operation, the basic elements of the Pierce theory will be 
described here.

The analysis is divided into several distinct parts. First, the RF current in the 
beam is given. (The relation used is the electronic equation, which can be derived 
in an analysis of space charge effects on bunching.) Then the slow wave circuit is 
analyzed. The circuit equation is then combined with the electronic equation to 
determine the propagation constants of the waves on the circuit and on the beam. 
Operation under synchronous (beam velocity equal to cold circuit phase velocity) 
and nonsynchronous (beam velocity not equal to cold circuit phase velocity) 
conditions are examined. Finally, the effects of circuit loss and of space charge are 
considered. The analysis is a small signal analysis, and it is assumed that quantities 
vary sinusoidally.  
 
12.2.1   RF Current in a Beam 
 
The current in the beam, iz, as a function of the electric field, Ez, can be found from 
an analysis of the effect of space charge on electron bunching. The result is the

several values, is the propagation constant for the waves on the beam and circuit.

12.2.2   Circuit Equation 
 
In the Pierce theory, the RF circuit of a TWT is modeled as a transmission line as 
shown in Figure 12-11. This model serves as a starting point, but then the analysis 
is generalized so that the exact form of the model is not important. The line has 
distributed inductance and capacitance per unit length of Lâ and Câ. The beam with 
current iz is assumed to pass very close to the circuit and, from Ramoâs theorem, 
the current induced in the circuit is I = iz.

12.2.3   The Determinantal Equation 
 
The electronic equation (12-1) and the circuit equation (12-5) provide two 
relationships between iz and Ez. These may be combined in the absence of space 
charge forces to obtain the determinantal equation from which the propagation 
constants can be obtained:

this equation and called the gain parameter, by

(12-7) 
The beam impedance is Vo / Io, so C 3 is one-quarter of the ratio of the circuit 
impedance to the beam impedance. Because Zo is usually on the order of tens of 
ohms and Vo / Io is on the order of thousands to tens of thousands of ohms, C 3 is a 
very small quantity so C is usually in the 0.01 to 0.1 range.  
 
The determinantal equation is a fourth-degree equation, which means that 
there will be four possible solutions for Î², and these represent four natural modes 
of propagation along the electron beam and the circuit. The circuit alone has two 
modes of propagation, and this is consistent with the fact that the voltages at the 
two ends can be specified independently, so two boundary conditions must be 
satisfied. Four boundary conditions must be satisfied with the combination of 
circuit and electron stream. These can be taken as the voltages at the two ends of 
the circuit and the RF velocity and current of the electron beam at the point where 
the beam enters the circuit. The four waves resulting from the determinantal 
equation make it possible to satisfy these boundary conditions. 
 
12.2.4   Synchronous Operation 
 
Synchronous operation occurs when the velocity of the electron beam is made 
equal to the velocity of the wave in the absence of electrons. By assuming 
synchronous operation, the problem of solving the determinantal equation is 
simplified. After the solution for synchronous operation has been obtained, 
nonsynchronous operation will be considered. 
 
Three of the propagation constants found from the determinantal equation, Î²1, 
Î²2, and Î²3, contain the propagation constant of the electron beam, Î²e, along with a 
small quantity (small because it is multiplied by C). As a result, each wave is a 
forward wave (traveling in the same direction as the electron beam) propagating at 
a velocity close to the beam velocity.  
 
In Î²1 and Î²2 there is a quantity +Î²eC/2, which indicates that the waves travel 

Traveling Wave Tubes 
 
329 
slower than the electron beam. In Î²3, the quantity âÎ²eC occurs, which indicates that 
the wave travels faster than the electron beam. The dominant quantity in the fourth 
wave is âÎ²e, which shows that the wave travels in the direction opposite to that of 
the electron beam.  
 
In Î²1 and Î²2, the imaginary part of the propagation constant indicates that the 
wave is either a growing wave (+ in Î²1) or a decaying wave (âin Î²2). Finally, the 
propagation constants Î²1 through Î²4 represent the four waves illustrated in Figure 
12-12. 
 
It is of particular interest to determine the rate at which the growing wave 
increases. This may be determined from the equation for Î²1, which describes the 
propagation of the electric field. Power is proportional to the square of the electric 
field, so the power gain is

Equation (12-8) gives the gain for the lossless case. In addition to being the 
lossless case, this does not include losses that occur when a signal is launched on 
an electron beam. Since three forward waves are launched on the beam, a signal 
applied to the input of a TWT must divide in some way among these three forward 
waves and so only a portion of the input signal is used to launch the growing 
wave. To determine the relative amplitudes of the launched waves, the boundary 
conditions at the input must be matched. Here, the three waves must add to give 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons

the correct RF electric field, velocity, and current. The result is that the input 
signal divides evenly among the three waves. (This is only true at the input where 
there is no initial velocity or current modulation on the beam.) 
 
Since only one-third of the input signal is used to launch the growing wave, 
the power gain, G, for the growing wave becomes

Initially, the voltage does not change with distance and there is no gain. This 
is because the electron beam has no RF current and cannot induce a signal into the 
circuit until it becomes bunched. Eventually, the increasing wave predominates 
over the other two and the slope of the line must correspond to that for the 
growing wave, that is, 47.3. The dashed line represents the increasing wave, which 
starts at â9.54 dB and has the slope 47.3. Pierce wrote an asymptotic expression

12.2.5   Nonsynchronous Operation 
 
When the electron beam travels at a velocity other than the velocity of the wave on 
the circuit in the absence of the beam, solutions to the quartic equation for the 
propagation constants are obtained numerically. 
 
Pierceâs velocity parameter, b, is useful in relating the dc electron velocity, uo, 
to the phase velocity of the circuit, vp, in the absence of electrons.

For b > 0, the electrons go faster than the undisturbed wave, and for b < 0, the 
electrons go slower than the undisturbed wave. For b = 0, the synchronous case 
occurs.  
 
Characteristics of the growing wave are shown in Figure 12-14. The quantities 
x1 and y1 are components of the propagation constant. Because x1 appears in the 
exponent in B in the gain equation as follows, it has a strong effect on gain.

Clearly, if x1 is positive, the wave is growing. If y1 is positive, it is traveling faster 
than the electron beam. Notice in Figure 12-14 that, regardless of beam velocity, 
the wave is growing. Also, since y1 < 0, the wave travels more slowly than the 
electrons, even when the electrons travel more slowly than the undisturbed wave 
(b < 0). In fact, the electrons must travel faster than the increasing wave to give 
energy to it. 
 
Pierce also noted that, in a tube in which the total gain is large, a change in b 
of Â± 1 about b = 0 can make a change of several decibels in gain. This change 
produces a difference between the phase velocity of the undisturbed wave, vp, and 
the electron velocity, uo, by approximately Â±C. Thus, the allowable difference 
between vp, which may be a function of frequency, and uo, which, of course, is not, 
is of the order of C.

12.2.6   Effect of Circuit Loss 
 
In addition to the losses that occur naturally in RF circuits, additional losses may 
be introduced to attenuate the backward wave. The backward wave normally 
originates from reflections either inside or outside the tube and can serve as a 
feedback mechanism to cause oscillations or large variations in gain (because of 
beating effects with the input signal). Pierce took loss into account by introducing 
the loss parameter, d, into the circuit propagation constant. The loss per 
wavelength, L, is 
 
 
 
54.5
dB
L   
Cd
=
 
(12-16) 
As an example, when C = 0.025 and d = 1, the loss is 1.36 dB/wavelength. 
 
The most significant effect of attenuation is, of course, that the gain of the 
growing wave is decreased. This may be shown by examining the very large effect 
of the reduction in x1 on the value of B in the gain equation (12-15). Figure 12-15 
illustrates the effect of d on B. Note that the maximum value of B occurs very 
close to b = 0. 
 
Pierce showed that, for small losses, the reduction in gain for the growing 
wave is about one-third of the circuit loss. The effect on the net gain of a TWT can 
be calculated only by taking into account the initial conditions in the presence of 
loss. 
 
12.2.7   Effect of Space Charge 
 
At the beginning of this chapter the electronic equation for the beam current as a 
function of electric field was combined with the circuit equation, which gave the 
circuit field acting on the electron beam. There was no consideration of space

charge forces and their contribution to the electric field. When the space charge 
field is included in the electric field, the effects of space charge appear in the 
determinantal equation as an additional term containing the quantity Q, which is 
defined as follows

Now the ratio of plasma frequency to RF frequency is a measure of space charge 
debunching forces. Pierceâs gain parameter, C, is a measure of the intensity of the 
interaction between the slow wave circuit and the electron beam. As a result, QC 
is a measure of the relative strength of the debunching forces to the bunching 
forces. Thus, QC has been adopted to describe the seriousness of space charge 
effects in traveling wave tubes. 
 
Figure 12-16 shows the values of x and y for the growing wave only for 
several values of QC. Several effects of space charge are apparent. The most

important is that the range of beam velocities (indicated by b) over which gain 
occurs (x1 positive) is severely restricted. Furthermore, the velocity at which there 
is maximum gain in the increasing wave is now higher than in the absence of 
space charge. Also, the maximum gain is reduced.

The significance of the slow space charge waves in TWT operation can be 
clearly seen by referring y and b to the incremental propagation constant for the 
slow space charge waves rather than Î²e as is done in Figure 12-17. Now it is very 
clear that maximum gain occurs when the slow space charge wave velocity is the 
phase velocity of the circuit. As the velocity of the electron bunches moves away 
from the circuit velocity, gain decreases. 
 
In Figures 12-16 and 12-17, it is also shown that the maximum gain decreases 
as the beam density (and QC) increases. This is to be expected because, as the 
beam density increases, space charge forces increase and the intensity of the 
bunching process decreases, which, in turn, means that the RF current in the beam 
decreases.

12.3   HIGH-LEVEL INTERACTION 
 
12.3.1   Discussion of Interactions 
 
Before considering high-level (nonlinear) interactions in a TWT, it is of value to 
briefly review the bunching action that occurs at small signal levels. As the beam 
enters the RF circuit of a TWT, the axial component of the electric field from the 
circuit accelerates some electrons and decelerates others to start the formation of 
bunches as indicated in Figure 12-18(a).

The resulting RF current in the beam induces a current and voltage on the 
circuit that lags behind the initial voltage by 90Â°. Thus, the induced wave travels 
more slowly than the initial wave. As the bunches and the induced wave grow, 
decelerating field regions develop where the bunches are located as shown in 
Figure 12-18(b). The energy extracted from decelerated electrons is transferred to 
the circuit field, thereby producing amplification of that field. As long as small 
signal conditions exist, Pierceâs theory applies and the various amplified waves on 
the beam and circuit grow exponentially with distance. 
 
As the waves grow, the interaction between the beam and circuit becomes 
nonlinear. Perhaps the clearest paper ever published describing nonlinear 
phenomena in a TWT was that by Cutler [18]. A large-scale model of a TWT was 
constructed. Using an electron deflection system, the electron velocities and 
currents in the beam leaving the TWT interaction region were measured as a 
function of phase position relative to the circuit wave. Some of Cutlerâs results 
showing the events leading up to saturation are shown in Figure 12-19. The RF 
drive levels are in decibels below the level that produced saturation. The circuit 
voltage is shown at the top of each of the frames of Figure 12-19. RF current is 
indicated by the width of the shaded region and RF velocity is indicated by the 
deflection of the shaded region, from the center horizontal line in each frame. 
Thus, in each frame there is a complete story of fundamental circuit voltage, 
electron velocity, and current as a function of phase, for a particular drive level.   
 
In Figure 12-19(a) the drive level was well below saturation and the current 
and velocity patterns were representative of small-signal conditions. Cutler noted 
that the velocity and current modulations at small-signal levels check calculated 
values well. The phase of the voltage relative to the RF electron velocity was 
computed from small-signal theory, but everything else in Figure 12-19, including 
subsequent variations in phase, was measured. 
 
The first evidence of nonlinear behavior occurred at 17 dB below saturation 
(Figure 12-19(b)). The velocity and current (in Cutlerâs words) âshow the 
beginnings of a cusp in the velocity curve and a definite non-sinusoidal bunching 
of the electrons in the retarding field region (between +30Â° and 210Â°).â 
 
The next pattern at 12 dB below saturation, Figure 12-19(c), shows the 
development of a spur on the velocity curve and further development of the 
electron bunch between +60Â° and +180Â°. Cutler observed that the velocity within 
the bunch did not change significantly from lower drive levels. For this to be true, 
since the bunch is in a decelerating portion of the circuit field, the space charge 
field must compensate for the circuit field. Near 60Â°, the decelerating field must 
increase rapidly to produce the sharp deceleration of electrons and the 
development of the velocity spur. Furthermore, Cutler observed that the 
decelerating field must be much larger than the circuit field because electrons just 
behind the cusp are much more sharply decelerated than those preceding the cusp. 
He concluded that there are very sharply defined space charge fields much 
stronger than the circuit field.

The next two patterns (Figure 12-19(d, e)) show continuing development of 
the spur, continued movement of electrons from the high velocity regions, and 
continued consolidation of the main bunch just ahead of the spur. Apparently, 
because the electron velocities within the bunch are still nearly the same as at 
lower drive levels, the space charge and its associated field in the bunch has 
increased enough to compensate for the circuit field so that the net field remains 
near zero.  
 
At 4 dB below the saturation drive level, the velocities of a large fraction of 
the electrons in the spur have increased because the spur has moved well into the 
accelerating region. The main bunch of electrons to the right of the spur has been 
concentrated into the 60Â°â120Â° phase interval. Apparently, the space charge field 
in advance of this region no longer compensates for the decelerating circuit field 
so electron velocity is decreasing. 
 
At saturation, the tip of the spur has formed into a bunch that is nearly equal 
to the main bunch and is in a circuit field that is nearly equal and opposite to that 
in the main bunch. The few electrons (indicated by the dashed line) ahead of the 
main bunch are being decelerated into a second low-velocity loop. The reason for 
saturation is that the power being extracted from the circuit by the spur bunch is 
nearly the same as the power being added by the main bunch. 
 
12.3.2   Estimates of Maximum Efficiency 
 
Early estimates of the maximum efficiency that might be achieved in a TWT were 
made without the aid of Cutlerâs experimental results and without the aid of 
computer models. Slater [19] suggested that energy extraction from the beam in a 
TWT could be analyzed by observing the motions of electrons while traveling 
along at the speed of the circuit wave. We will use one of the frames from Cutlerâs 
results (Figure 12-19(d)) to illustrate Slaterâs suggestion. That frame is shown in 
Figure 12-20. The initial beam velocity is uo. The velocity of the circuit wave is 
Îuo below the beam velocity. Slater suggested that electrons eventually become 
trapped and oscillate in the region of the maximum decelerating circuit field. This 
trapping is clearly evident in Figure 12-20, where a bunch is shown to have 
formed ahead of the velocity cusp in the decelerating field. 
 
If the electrons initially have an average velocity, uo, greater than that of the 
circuit wave by Îuo, and they are reflected by the decelerating field, they cannot 
acquire a velocity backwards relative to the wave greater than Îuo. Those electrons 
in the small bunch to the left of the velocity cusp in Figure 12-20 fall into this 
category. These have been decelerated below the initial beam velocity by 2Îuo. 
The maximum efficiency would occur if all of the electrons (rather than the small 
fraction shown in Figure 12-20) were reflected and decelerated by the velocity 
increment 2Îuo.

Pierce [17] followed Slaterâs line of reasoning and used the Pierce small-
signal expression for the velocity of the growing circuit wave to determine Îuo. 
Pierce noted that âsuch considerations are complicated by the fact that the phase 
velocity of the wave in the large-signal region will not be the same as its phase 
velocity in the small-signal region. It is interesting, however, to see what limiting 
efficiencies this leads to.â

As an example, for a value of y1 of â1 and C of 0.05, the maximum efficiency is 
predicted to be about 20%, which is high but not totally unrealistic. 
 
It should be noted in Cutlerâs work (Figure 12-19(f)) that the maximum 
efficiency (saturation) actually occurred when the electron bunch to the left of the 
velocity cusp was nearly equal to the main bunch. The velocities of the two 
bunches were nearly the same and were about the velocity of the circuit wave (Îuo 
below uo). As a result, the efficiency in Cutlerâs experiment is predicted to be 
about half that in (12-20) or

12.3.3   Comment on Computer Modeling 
 
Cutlerâs results give a clear picture of events leading up to saturation. An 
important impact on theoretical considerations is that the velocity becomes 
multivalued, and it does so at a relatively low drive level (see Figure 12-19(c), for 
example). Thus, the theoretical techniques (usually referred to as the Eulerian 
approach) that treat the electron beam as a fluid cannot be used. For example, our 
technique for analyzing space charge wave behavior in Chapter 9 and the Pierce 
theory of traveling wave interaction in this chapter both treat the beam as a fluid. 
These approaches are not valid when velocity becomes multivalued. 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
340 
 
Instead of the fluid approach, the theory must be able to follow individual 
particles or groups of particles. This is referred to as the Lagrangian approach to 
the analysis. The ballistic theory of velocity modulation in Chapter 8 and of 
ballistic bunching in Chapter 9 used this approach. Space charge forces, which 
were ignored in those calculations, must be included. 
 
No algebraic theory is available for use with the large-signal particle 
approach. Instead, numerical techniques must be used. It is beyond the scope of 
this book to examine the computer modeling of interactions in microwave tubes. 
This is not to degrade the importance of computer modeling. All modern TWTs 
are designed with the aid of computer codes. Most of the very important TWT 
characteristics such as power, electronic and overall efficiencies, and bandwidth 
can be accurately predicted with these codes. In the early 1990s, there was even a 
code available (the IBC code [20]) that ran on a personal computer and provided a 
great deal of insight into the performance of a TWT as various operating and 
design parameters were varied. 
 
From the early numerical computations of Nordsieck [21], who ignored space 
charge effects, there was a steady development of computational techniques in the 
late 1950s and 1960s. Some of the more important of these works are listed as 
[22â32]. Some results from Hessâs analysis [29] are given in Figure 12-21. 
Various quantities are plotted as a function of distance along the circuit in half 
wavelengths. The shaded areas of the distance scale indicate regions of 
decelerating circuit field. Note the similarity of the overall appearance of the 
electron velocity plots with those given by Cutler (Figure 12-19). 
 
The earliest indication of nonlinear interaction in Hessâs results appears in the 
electron density plot, when density becomes nonsinusoidal. A few half 
wavelengths later, a spur, like the Cutler spur, develops on the velocity plot and 
the velocity becomes multivalued. Also, the electron density bunch splits and, in 
subsequent half wavelengths, a portion falls back into an accelerating field. The 
resulting acceleration of electrons is shown by the increase in velocity of electrons 
in the spur. Finally, saturation occurs (the efficiency and circuit voltage reach 
maximum values) when a sufficient number of electrons have drifted back into the 
accelerating field. 
 
12.3.4   Velocity Tapering 
 
A major reason for saturation of the power output in TWTs is the reduction in 
average beam velocity caused by the transfer of electron energy to the circuit 
fields. An example of this reduction in average beam velocity is shown in Hessâs 
results in Figure 12-21. The dashed line in the electron velocity plot shows 
average beam velocity. As we have discussed in a previous section, partly as a 
result of the reduced velocity near saturation, electrons fall back out of phase with 
the circuit field, move into accelerating regions, and extract energy from the 
circuit.

It has been recognized since the original invention of the TWT (see the 
varying pitch of the helix in Figure 12-1 from Lindenbladâs patent) that efficiency 
might be improved if the circuit is modified so that the velocity of the circuit wave 
decreases along with the beam velocity. Then, even though the bunches are slowed 
down as they lose energy to the circuit, they will remain in phase with the circuit 
wave and continue to deliver energy.

This technique of modifying the circuit to enhance efficiency (and often other 
TWT characteristics) is known as velocity tapering. Early attempts to use velocity 
tapering produced little or no improvement in efficiency over untapered circuits. 
The advent of computer analyses (see [30], for example) has resulted in the design 
of tapers that produce appreciable improvements in efficiency. In [31], Meeker 
and Rowe reported an efficiency improvement from 18% to 35% through the use 
of a variable-pitch helix.

Another example of a computer-designed taper is reported in [33]. In a NASA 
development of a 20-GHz coupled-cavity TWT, a phase-adjusted taper was used 
to achieve an RF efficiency of 22.6% and a peak power of 1,000W. Previously, the 
interaction structure for this particular tube had a piecewise linear taper that 
consisted of sequences of cavities of equal length and cavity sequences of linearly 
tapering length. The RF efficiency of that tube was 9.6% and the peak power 
output was 420W. In the phase-adjusted taper, the phase of the electron bunches 
with respect to the phase of the circuit field changes gradually from a value (about 
0Â°) conducive to the formation of strong bunches at the input end of the taper to a 
value (about 90Â°) conducive to strong transfer of beam power to the circuit at the 
output end of the taper. A comparison of the efficiencies of the TWTs with the 
piecewise linear taper and with the phase-adjusted taper is shown in Figure 12-22.

In addition to enhancing efficiency, a properly designed velocity taper can be 
used to enhance the linearity of the power output versus power input characteristic 
of a TWT. This is particularly important in communications applications of TWTs, 
where low distortion is required. An example of a linearizing taper is the dynamic 
velocity taper (DVT) developed by Kosmahl and reported in [34]. The basic 
philosophy of the DVT may be understood by examining the relation for Pierceâs 
velocity parameter (12-14), which is

nonlinear operation the beam gives up energy to the circuit. The average velocity 
of the beam decreases and so the velocity parameter decreases. To prevent the gain 
from decreasing, it is necessary to modify the circuit and vq so that the velocity 
parameter remains constant. 
 
Results are presented in the referenced report [34] for TWTs with and without 
DVTs. For one of the TWTs with the DVT (the 12-GHz, 50-W Hughes 8802 
experimental TWT), the pitch variation is shown in Figure 12-23 and the resulting 
improvement in linearity and power output is shown in Figure 12-24.

Note in Figure 12-23 that the pitch decreases linearly (this decrease is actually 
the first part of an exponential decrease) by about 7% over the final 18% of the 
length of the helix. The results of this change in pitch are impressive as shown in 
Figure 12-24. The linearity near saturation is significantly improved, and the 
power characteristic approaches that of a hard limiter at saturation. (The 
discrepancy between computed and measured powers resulted from the use of cold 
rather than hot helix loss values in the computation.) The power output is 
increased about 1.5 dB and the RF efficiency (efficiency of conversion of beam 
power to RF output power) is about 16%, which is 5% better than without the 
DVT. The relative phase delay near saturation is about 30Â° and the AM to PM 
conversion does not exceed 3Â°/dB, which is nearly the same as that in an 
unmodified TWT.

Finally, Kosmahl and Peterson noted that, with an RF efficiency of 16%, a 
well-designed multistage depressed collector should raise the overall efficiency 
above 50%. By replacing the beryllium oxide (BeO) support rods for the helix 
with diamond, losses could be reduced, the interaction impedance would be 
improved, and the overall efficiency would increase to about 65%.

Wave Velocities and Dispersion 
 
 
For amplification to occur in a traveling wave tube, the axial component of the 
velocity of the wave on the RF circuit must be close to the velocity of the bunches 
of electrons in the beam. If, as frequency is varied, the velocity of the wave on the 
circuit moves away from the electron bunch velocity, gain will decrease. As a 
result, the variation of circuit wave velocity with frequency is an important 
consideration in the design of a TWT. 
 
A circuit in which the wave velocity varies with frequency is said to have 
dispersion or to be dispersive. Before discussing dispersion in detail, it is 
important to examine wave velocities and, in particular, the concepts of the group 
and phase velocities of a wave. 
 
 
13.1   GROUP AND PHASE VELOCITY 
 
Figure 13-1 may help clarify group and phase velocity. Waves are breaking at an 
angle Î¸ on a beach. The velocity, v, with which the wave is moving is indicated by 
a vector perpendicular to the wave crest. The velocity with which the wave crest 
sweeps along the beach is indicated by a vector parallel to the beach. This is the 
velocity at which any point on the wave (or any particular phase of the wave) 
sweeps along the beach. This velocity is the phase velocity and is denoted by vp. A 
person walking along the beach and desiring to keep up with the wave crest (or 
with any other point on the wave) would have to walk at the phase velocity. 
Similarly, a person on a surfboard desiring to ride the crest of the wave in a path 
parallel to the beach would have to move at this same phase velocity. 
 
The magnitude of the phase velocity depends on the direction chosen for 
phase velocity relative to the direction of motion of the wave. In Figure 13-1(b) 
the angle between the crest of the wave and the beach (and the direction chosen for 
the phase velocity) is smaller than in Figure 13-1(a). As a result, the wave crest in 
Figure 13-1(b) sweeps along the beach more rapidly than in Figure 13-1(a). Thus, 
the phase velocity has increased.

The group velocity, vg, is the velocity of the energy of the wave in the 
direction of interest. For example, in Figure 13-1(a), as the energy in the wave at 
point A moves to point B, the distance that energy moves in parallel to the beach 
(and to the phase velocity) is from A to C. Thus, in this case, the group velocity is 
the component of the wave velocity in the direction of the phase velocity. Like the 
phase velocity, the magnitude of the group velocity depends on direction. This can 
be seen by comparing Figure 13-1(a) to Figure 13-1(b). The group velocity in 
Figure 13-1(b) is smaller than that in Figure 13-1(a).

velocity. 
 
 
Group velocity and phase velocity can have opposite directions. Consider, for 
example, Figure 13-2. The waves are moving to the left and the group velocity is 
to the left. It is assumed that there is a seawall with equally spaced openings along 
the shoreline. It is also assumed that a person walking along the beach would be 
able to see the waves only when passing one of the openings in the seawall. The 
person could walk from right to left and pass successive openings at the same time 
that one of the wave crests did. Assuming that the angle Î¸ is the same as in Figure 
13-1(a), then the magnitudes of velocities would all be the same as in Figure 
13-1(a), but the directions would be reversed. 
 
Alternatively, the person could walk from left to right (from 1 to 2, for 
example) and pass the openings in synchronism with successive wave crests 
moving from right to left (from 3 to 2, for example). In this case, the phase 
velocity is to the right while the group velocity is to the left. For a person on a 
surfboard to move to the right and continue to be accelerated by the wave crests 
(which are moving to the left), that person would have to jump from wave crest to 
wave crest.  
 
When the group velocity and the phase velocity are in opposite directions, 
interaction with the wave is referred to as a backward wave interaction. An 
important aspect of this interaction, which was evident in the previous discussion, 
is that the interaction is periodic rather than continuous as it is when the group 
velocity and the phase velocity are in the same directions.

13.2   DISPERSION 
 
A circuit in which the wave velocity varies with frequency is said to have 
dispersion or to be dispersive. Two ways are commonly used to illustrate the 
dispersion characteristics of a circuit. One, shown in Figure 13-3, is 
straightforward. The vertical axis represents phase velocity and the horizontal axis 
represents frequency. The plot for a circuit with no dispersion is simply a 
horizontal line. For a circuit with dispersion, the line is not horizontal.

Phase Velocity
No Dispersion

The second way to show dispersion characteristics is with a Brillouin 
diagram, which is often referred to as an Ï-Î² diagram. Here, Ï is angular 
frequency and Î² is the wave propagation constant. This diagram is not as 
straightforward as the first (phase velocity versus frequency). However, its use 
permits the display of considerably more information than the first. Because of the 
importance and widespread use of Ï-Î² diagrams in the microwave component 
industry, their development is considered here.

A convenient way to develop an understanding of Ï-Î² diagrams is to consider, 
first, simple microwave circuits and how their characteristics are represented. For 
this purpose, we will use a coaxial transmission line, which is not dispersive, and a 
waveguide, which is dispersive. Following these two examples, the more 
complicated example of a periodically loaded waveguide is examined. 
 
13.2.1   Coaxial Transmission Line 
 
In the fundamental TEM mode in a vacuum insulated coaxial line shown in Figure 
13-4, the wave velocity and the electric and magnetic field lines are in planes 
perpendicular to the axis of the transmission line. The group velocity and the 
phase velocity are the same and are the velocity of light, c, for all frequencies. 
Thus, the coaxial line has no dispersion.

The plot of Ï versus Î² for the coaxial line is given in Figure 13-5. The plot is a 
straight line with slope c. In general, those portions of an Ï-Î² diagram with 
constant slope represent frequency regions of operation of a circuit in which phase 
velocity is constant, so there is no dispersion. 
 
13.2.2   Rectangular Waveguide 
 
The phase velocity of a wave in rectangular waveguide varies with frequency so 
the waveguide is dispersive. To understand why phase velocity varies with 
frequency and how phase and group velocity are shown on an Ï-Î² diagram, it is 
useful to examine the configuration of waves in a rectangular waveguide.

A convenient place to start is with the consideration of two waves of equal 
amplitude traveling in free space, as indicated in Figure 13-6. The direction of 
propagation of one is at an angle +Î± with respect to the z axis and the other is at an 
angle âÎ±. The solid lines represent positions of wave crests (maximum value of E 
field out of the figure) and the dashed lines represent positions of wave troughs 
(minimum value of E field into the figure).

the z direction. 
 
 
Wherever wave crests and troughs (solid and dashed lines) intersect, the 
electric field is zero and only a magnetic field exists. In fact, all along a plane 
through zero-field points and parallel to the y-z plane, the electric field is zero.  
The E field is zero not only for the instant of time implied in Figure 13-6, but also 
at other times for waves propagating at the angles shown. Thus, conductors can be 
inserted along these planes without disturbing the E fields as long as the currents 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
352 
in the conductors correspond to those that would be induced by the magnetic 
fields. 
 
The magnetic fields are also parallel to any x-z plane, and the electric fields 
are perpendicular to these planes. Thus, conductors with currents and charges 
corresponding to those that would be induced by the fields can be placed in the x-z 
planes. 
 
Finally, two conductors in the y-z plane can be joined to the conductors in the 
x-z plane to form a rectangular pipe (waveguide) containing portions of the two 
waves. These two waves can propagate as though they were in free space, except 
that, in reality, they are continually reflected back and forth from one side of the 
guide to the other. In fact, there is only one wave because each wave is a reflection 
of the other. 
 
The velocity with which the wave propagates along the waveguide (the group 
velocity) can easily be determined with the aid of Figure 13-7. Each component of 
the wave travels at the speed of light, c, at an angle Î± with respect to the axis of the 
guide. As a result, the group velocity is smaller than c and is

(13-2) 
The phase velocity of the wave (the velocity of a particular phase or amplitude of 
the wave) is indicated by vp. Thus, as the crest of the wave propagates at angle Î± a 
distance proportional to the velocity of light, c, the crest sweeps along the wall of 
the waveguide a distance proportional to higher velocity, vp, which is

If an electron traveling parallel to the wall of the waveguide was to ârideâ the crest 
of the wave and continually be deflected into the figure by the electric field, it 
would have to move at velocity vp. Of course, this is not possible because, in this 
example, vp > c. TWT circuits are designed to be âslow-waveâ circuits so that 
vp < c  and so electrons can move at a velocity equal to the phase velocity. 

Wave Velocities and Dispersion 
 
353 
 
To examine the dispersion of waveguide, it is necessary to consider the 
change in wave configuration that takes place in a waveguide when frequency is 
varied. Shown in Figure 13-8 are wave configurations for three different 
frequencies f1 > f2 > f3. Group velocities and phase velocities are also indicated.

Note that, as frequency decreases, wavelength increases and the angle Î± must 
increase for the wave to fit in the waveguide. Note also that, as Î»/2 approaches the 
width of the guide, a, Î± approaches 90Â° and most of the wave motion is back and 
forth across the waveguide rather than along the waveguide. When Î± = 90Â°, wave 
propagation down the guide stops and the condition known as cutoff occurs. The 
wavelength and frequency at which cutoff occurs are often denoted by Î»c and fc. As 
frequency decreases from f1 through f2 to f3 and then to fc, the phase velocity 
steadily increases and, in fact, becomes infinite at cutoff. At the same time, the 
group velocity steadily decreases and becomes zero at cutoff. 
 
The Ï-Î² relation for the rectangular waveguide may be derived by examining 
the wave velocities as a function of frequency (or wavelength) with the aid of 
Figure 13-9. Thus,

In this section, we have treated the wave in a rectangular waveguide as though 
it were composed of two waves. As noted previously, there is only one wave, 
because each is a reflection of the other. The amplitude of the resulting electric 
field as functions of axial and transverse positions in the waveguide is shown in 
Figure 13-13. It should be noted that this is the fundamental TE01 mode of 
propagation. TE refers to the configuration of the electric field (E), which is

transverse (T) to the axis of the guide. There are no variations of field across the 
narrow dimension of the guide (thus, the subscript 0) and one-half sinusoidal 
variation in the broad dimension (subscript 1). At higher frequencies, other modes 
not of interest at this point in the discussion can propagate.

The guide wavelength is longer than the free-space wavelength, Î», at all normal 
operating frequencies. In applications of waveguides, only the guide wavelength is 
of value. The free-space wavelength was an artifice of use in explaining 
waveguide behavior but plays no role in the use of waveguide. Thus, in the 
following discussions, in which wavelength in the waveguide is discussed, it is to 
be assumed that guide wavelength is the quantity is question even though the term 
wavelength is used. 
 
Finally, in considering the Ï-Î² diagram for waveguide, it is important to note 
that waves can propagate with identical characteristics in either direction and so 
the Ï-Î² diagram is symmetrical about the Ï axis as shown in Figure 13-14. At 
higher frequencies, in either direction, the group and phase velocities approach the 
velocity of light.

13.2.3   Periodically Loaded Waveguide 
 
An obstacle, such as a metal vane in a waveguide, produces a change in 
impedance and is said to load the waveguide. This loading causes part of a 
propagating wave to be reflected. If equally spaced obstacles are used, the 
waveguide is said to be periodically loaded. In an infinitely long waveguide, if the 
reflections from the obstacles add in phase, complete reflection of a wave will 
eventually occur. Thus, the wave is âstoppedâ and, in a frequency range where 
complete reflection occurs, a âstopbandâ is produced.

An example of a periodically loaded waveguide is shown in Figure 13-15. 
The obstacles are metal vanes attached to the top and bottom of the waveguide. 
The impedance produced by these vanes is capacitive. The phase shift that occurs 
in the electric field reflected from each vane is 180Â°. At frequencies near Ïc, the 
phase velocity is high and the wavelength is much longer than the spacing between 
vanes, L. Wave reflections from vanes do not add in phase, so there is little effect 
on wave propagation. As frequency is increased, the wavelength decreases and 
approaches 2L so that the phase shift between vanes is 180Â°. Then reflections from 
the vanes add in phase, as is illustrated in Figure 13-16. 
 
In Figure 13-16(a), the sinusoid indicates the amplitude of the electric field in 
the waveguide. The forward and reflected waves at each of the vanes are indicated 
by vertical arrows. Fa, Fb, and Fc indicate the forward waves and Ra, Rb, and Rc 
indicate the reflected waves at vanes 1, 2, and 3.

For Figure 13-16(b), it is assumed that the forward wave has propagated a 
distance Î»/2 = L (Ï rad) to the right. At the same time reflections from the vanes in 
Figure 13-16(a) have propagated Ï rad to the left. Thus, for example, Ra arrives at 
vane 2 at the same time that Fc does and adds in phase with the reflection, Rc, from 
vane 2. Eventually, in an infinitely long waveguide, complete reflection of the 
forward wave occurs. There is no propagation so the group velocity goes to zero. 
The resulting effect on the Ï-Î² diagram is shown in Figure 13-17. Here, instead of 
plotting Î² in radians/meter, the horizontal axis is Î²L, which is simply the phase 
shift in radians from vane to vane.

The next problem to be considered is the shape of the Ï-Î² characteristic for 
values of Î²L > Ï. Certainly, the curve does not stop at Î²L = Ï. Consider, first, a 
value of Î²L somewhat less than Ï. For this case, the wave pattern is as indicated in 
Figure 13-18(a). The phase velocity is higher than at Î²L = Ï and the wavelength is 
longer.

It is useful, at this point, to consider an electron moving along the axis of the 
guide. If the electron moves at the phase velocity of the wave, then, of course, the 
electron will move from vane to vane in the same time that it takes the wave crest 
to move from vane to vane. The electron is said to maintain synchronism with the 
wave.  
 
To consider a value of Î²L > Ï, assume, as indicated in Figure 13-18(b), that a 
wave with the same frequency as that for Figure 13-18(a) is traveling in the 
backward direction. The wavelength and phase velocity (in the backward 
direction) are the same as those for the forward wave in Figure 13-18(a). An 
electron moving to the right with the same velocity as in Figure 13-18(a) will 
arrive at the next vane before the next backward-moving wave crest does. The 
velocity of the electron must be reduced for the electron to arrive at the next vane 

Wave Velocities and Dispersion

when the next backward-moving wave crest does (for the electron to be 
synchronous with the backward wave). Thus, the phase velocity of the wave as 
seen by the electron in Figure 13-18(b) is lower than the phase velocity of the 
forward wave in Figure 13-18(a). 
 
As a result of these considerations, it is seen that as Î²L increases above Ï, a 
backward wave exists and the Ï-Î² curve must turn downward as shown in Figure 
13-19. In fact, for values of Î²L in the range Ï < Î²L < 2Ï, the wave is a backward 
wave and the Ï-Î² characteristic is the same as for âÏ < Î²L < 0.

As Î²L approaches 2Ï, the backward wave approaches the cutoff condition 
with wavelength and phase velocity (in the reverse direction) approaching infinity. 
For an electron velocity (and phase velocity in the forward direction) such that 
Î²L = 2Ï, the electron moves from vane to vane in synchronism with wave crests of 
the backward wave that are an infinite distance apart but moving with infinite 
velocity. 
 
Finally, as Î²L increases to values greater than 2Ï, a forward wave again exists 
and the Ï-Î² diagram turns upward again. The shape of the curve from Î²L = 2Ï to 
Î²L = 3Ï is the same as for 0 â¤ Î²L â¤ Ï. The part of the Ï-Î² diagram shown in Figure 
13-19 is referred to as a passband because waves can propagate. This band will be 
of primary interest when coupled-cavity TWTs are considered. 
 
Before coupled-cavity structures can be considered (in Chapter 15), it should 
be noted that there are other passbands for periodically loaded waveguides. There 
are bands of frequencies in which reflections from the vanes do not add in phase 
and wave propagation takes place. However, whenever the frequency approaches a 
condition where the distance between vanes is equal to several half wavelengths, a 
cutoff condition occurs and this places a limit on the upper or lower frequency of 
the band. As a result, the Ï-Î² diagram contains an infinite set of passbands, four of 
which are shown in Figure 13-20.

Helix TWTs 
 
 
The TWT invented by Lindenblad used a helix as the slow wave circuit. During 
the formative years of TWT development, hundreds of other propagation 
structures were investigated, but the helix remains as the circuit of choice when a 
broad bandwidth is required. Major applications for helix TWTs include radar, 
communications, and electronic countermeasures (ECM). The purpose of this 
chapter is to describe the characteristics of helix TWTs that have made them the 
mainstay of the TWT industry. 
 
 
14.1   BANDWIDTH 
 
The extremely broad bandwidth of the helix is the single most important property 
of this circuit. No other circuit has ever rivaled the helix in bandwidth and most do 
not even come close. Helix TWTs can now be made with a bandwidth of over 2 
octaves, as shown in Figure 14-1. 
 
The broad bandwidth of the helix results from its low dispersion. The helical 
circuit can be thought of as being derived from a single-wire transmission line for 
which the dispersion is zero. Shown in Figure 14-2(a) is a helix and in Figure 
14-2(b) a view of the helix when it has been cut at the points marked by x and 
unrolled. A wave propagating along a wire with the speed of light, c, advances in 
the axial direction with phase velocity

The ideal Ï-Î² diagram for the helix is shown in Figure 14-3. The phase 
velocity, vp, is represented by a straight line through the origin. Thus, in this case, 
the circuit has no dispersion. The dashed line represents the beam velocity, uo, and 
has a slightly greater slope than the phase velocity line. This is so that the slow 
space charge wave (the electron bunches), which has a velocity slower than the 
electron beam, is synchronous with the phase velocity. 
 
In theory, a circuit with the Ï-Î² characteristic in Figure 14-3 could be used 
over an almost unlimited bandwidth. In practice, bandwidth is limited by several 
factors. First of all, for a given circuit, as the frequency of operation is decreased, 
the length of the circuit, expressed in wavelengths, decreases. Since gain is 
proportional to circuit length in wavelengths, gain decreases.

Figure 14-3   Ï-Î² diagram for a helix with no dispersion. 
 
 
As the frequency of operation is increased, the electric field pattern on the 
helix shrinks as is shown in Figure 14-4. As a result, the interaction of the field 
with the electron beam decreases and gain decreases. Maximum gain occurs at 
about four turns of the helix per wavelength (or Ï/2 radians per turn). 
 
Another factor that limits bandwidth is dispersion. In reality, a helix with its 
supporting structure does have dispersion; this is discussed in Section 14.1.1. 
 
A very serious factor that limits bandwidth and also the power capability of 
the helix is the backward wave oscillations (BWO) that occur at Î²p = Ï radians. 
The reasons for these oscillations and techniques for controlling them are 
discussed later in this chapter. 
 
If no techniques are used to control dispersion and oscillations, the bandwidth 
of the helix TWT is limited to about 1 octave at most. With dispersion control and 
BWO suppression, bandwidth can be increased to 2 or more octaves.

14.1.1   Dispersion 
 
Unless corrective actions are taken, a helix has dispersion because phase velocity 
varies as shown in Figures 14-5 and 14-6. When compared with a coaxial line 
(with no dispersion), from which the helix can be considered to be derived, the 
helix has electric and magnetic coupling from turn to turn that is absent in the 
coax. This is one reason for the dispersion. 
  
Another factor to consider is that, at high frequencies (and a relatively small 
number of turns per wavelength), the electric and magnetic fields are concentrated 
between turns of the helix. As the frequency is reduced and the number of turns 
per wavelength is increased, the fields extend farther from the helix, as is indicated 
in Figure 14-7. Therefore, a metal shell (barrel) surrounding the helix will 
intercept a greater portion of the fields at low frequencies than at high frequencies. 
(Note in Figure 14-7 that only the position of the barrel is shown. The distortion of 
the field patterns that the barrel produces is not shown.) As the barrel is brought 
closer to the helix, the effect increases, and the wave velocity on the helix 
decreases. The effect on velocity is greater at low frequencies than at high 
frequencies. 
 
The helix is supported by an insulating structure that often takes the form of 
three equally spaced dielectric rods as indicated in Figure 14-5. These rods and the 
ways in which they are incorporated in a TWT are discussed in a following 
section. The effect of the dielectric material of the rods is also evident in Figure 
14-5 [1]. Wave velocity is inversely proportional to the square root of the 
dielectric constant. Thus, when dielectric material is added in the region 
surrounding the helix, wave velocity decreases.

14.1.2   Dispersion Control 
 
Because the increase in phase velocity at low frequencies can be partially offset by 
bringing the barrel closer to the helix, dispersion is reduced. Unfortunately, there 
is an accompanying decrease in circuit interaction impedance that is undesirable 
because gain and efficiency are reduced. The decrease in impedance results from 
the increase in capacitive loading and inductive coupling of the helix currents to 
the barrel and the flow of current in the circumferential direction in the barrel.

Ideally, if a metallic shell that conducted only in the axial direction could be 
placed around the helix, there would be no inductive coupling and no 
circumferential currents could flow in the shell. Still, the shell would have a 
greater effect on the electric field at low frequencies than at high frequencies so 
control of dispersion would be possible. 
 
In practice, an axially conducting shell is approximated by one of the 
techniques illustrated in Figure 14-8 [2]. One of the four configurations shown 
(labeled unloaded) is used for comparison purposes and has only the outer metal 
shell, which supports the helix through dielectric support rods. In the other three 
configurations, either solid, vane-shaped, or T-shaped metallic elements, which are 
frequently referred to as anisotropic loading elements, are used to provide the 
desired loading. 
 
Experiments have been performed to provide a basis for the choice of the best 
loading technique to use for controlling dispersion. Shown in Figure 14-9 are 
phase velocity and Pierceâs velocity parameter as functions of frequency for three 
of the configurations in Figure 14-8. Tests were performed with two T-shaped 
elements having different spacings from the helix. The results were obtained in 
tubes containing these configurations, which were nearly identical in all other 
respects. 
 
With tube number 1, phase velocity increases and b decreases as frequency is 
reduced. In tube number 2, the vanes produced a virtually flat phase-velocity 
characteristic over nearly the entire frequency range. In tubes number 3 and 4, the 
T-shaped segments produced negative dispersion characteristics. That is, the phase 
velocity decreased at low frequencies.

The small-signal gain characteristics of the four tubes tested are shown in 
Figure 14-10. The maximum gain for tube number 1 occurred in the 6- to 7-GHz 
range. This frequency corresponds to a wavelength such that there are about four 
helix turns per wavelength. This is in agreement with the prediction of the 
small-signal theory of helix TWTs. At higher frequencies, gain decreases because 
the field lines are concentrated closer to the helix (this was shown in Figures 14-4 
and 14-7) and the component available for interaction with the beam decreases. At 
lower frequencies, gain decreases because the length of the helix, in terms of the 
number of wavelengths, decreases. Of the four tubes tested, tube number 4, which 
had a closer helix-to-loading-element spacing than tube number 3, had the best 
small-signal bandwidth (in excess of 2 octaves).

Shown in Figure 14-11 is a cutaway view of a PPM-focused helix TWT 
containing T-shaped loading elements. In this example, the tungsten tape helix is 
supported by anisotropic pyrolytic boron nitride (APBN) rods. The reason for 
using APBN and the techniques for assembling the helix and supported-rod 
structure are discussed in Section 14.3.2. 
 
One of the problems with the very wide bandwidth that can be achieved with 
anisotropic loading is the high harmonic power that is generated at low 
frequencies. This is shown in Figure 14-1 and in Figure 14-12. The harmonics 
result from the velocity modulation and bunching processes that are highly 
nonlinear. At the low end of the operating band of a broadband helix TWT, the 
second- and even the third-harmonic signals generated in the beam are within the 
bandwidth of the tube and are amplified. At the lower end of the band, harmonic 
power can rival fundamental power.

One way to reduce harmonic output power is with harmonic injection. An 
indication of the effectiveness of this technique is illustrated in Figure 14-12. 
When a second harmonic signal of the proper phase and amplitude is injected, 
along with the fundamental signal, the harmonic output power drops and the 
fundamental power increases. This occurs when the injected second-harmonic 
signal is 180Â° out of phase with the second harmonic signal generated by the 
beam-circuit interaction process. With proper design of the input circuit, the 
cancellation process can be made reasonably noncritical. 
 
 
14.2   GAIN 
 
At small signal levels, the gain produced by the interaction of the beam and the 
helix is proportional to CN where C is Pierceâs gain parameter and N is the length 
of the helix in wavelengths (see Chapter 12). Clearly, for very long helices, gain 
can be enormous.  
 
Here it is important to understand a distinction between a TWT and a 
klystron. In the klystron, there is no way for a wave to travel from the output to the 
input on the circuit so feedback by this mechanism cannot occur. However, in a 
TWT, one of the four waves on the circuit travels in the backward direction. This 
wave can carry power reflected from the load or output region backward to the 
input.

If there is a mismatch at the input, a portion of the signal will be reflected to 
provide a feedback signal. The phase of this signal depends on the frequency of 
operation and the path length through the tube. Depending on the phase, the signal 
can add to or subtract from the input signal to produce variations in gain (âgain 
rippleâ). It is also possible for the feedback signal to cause oscillations. 
 
To minimize feedback, the transitions from the transmission lines into and out 
of a TWT must be designed to provide very good impedance matches. Even if the 
output impedance match is perfect, the load impedance may not be matched to the 
output transmission line impedance and so reflections can occur. As a result, in 
addition to making sure that impedance matches are adequate, it is necessary to 
provide attenuation and/or severs within the TWT to prevent oscillations and to 
minimize gain ripple. 
 
14.2.1   Transitions 
 
The impedance of a helix varies with frequency, as is shown in Figure 14-13 [3]. 
In this example, the helix structure was designed for operation from 4.8 to 9.6 
GHz (1 octave). At the center of the band, the impedance was about 50â¦. At the 
low end of the band, the impedance increased to over 80â¦, and at the high end it 
was about 35â¦. TWTs capable of operating over more than an octave have even 
greater impedance variations. As a result, the impedance transitions at the input 
and output of these TWTs must be able to match the wide variation in helix 
impedance.

Designs for broadband transitions are based on the idea illustrated in Figure 
14-14. Here the tapered section of a coaxial line is used to match the low 
impedance of the coax on the left to the high impedance of the coax on the right. 
An excellent impedance match is realized if the tapered transition is long 
compared with the wavelength of the signal. 
 
In a TWT, a very broadband impedance match to the helix could be made 
with the transition shown in Figure 14-15 [1]. A gradual change in geometry is 
made so that the helix slowly changes into a coaxial line. As long as the overall 
transition is long compared to the wavelength, there would be an excellent 
impedance match. 
 
Unfortunately, transitions like that shown in Figure 14-15 have the very 
serious disadvantage of being long. If used, they would increase the length and 
weight of a TWT. In practice, transitions are normally made after the signal is 
removed from the helix. For example, the center conductor of the coaxial line can 
be tapered as shown in Figure 14-16.

A problem with the configuration in Figure 14-16 is that it requires a 
relatively long unsupported section of the center conductor of the coaxial line. 
Under severe shock and vibration conditions, the weld joint at the end of the helix 
may fail. Also, the last turn of the helix tends to be more poorly supported than 
other turns when the triangulation or pressure-insertion assembly techniques to be 
described in the following section are used. Heat transfer from the last turn 
through the support rods may be relatively poor so that the last turn must be at 
least partially cooled by the center conductor of the coaxial line. 
 
To provide adequate cooling and help prevent failure of the weld, there should 
be a support for the center conductor located as close to the helix as possible. For 
example, in the output window of a TWT, the insulating support for the center 
conductor is usually only a fraction of a wavelength from the connection to the 

Helix TWTs 
 
375 
helix. The material of this support is usually beryllium oxide, which is a very good 
thermal conductor. The beryllium oxide is brazed to the center conductor and to 
the outer conductor and serves as part of the vacuum envelope. 
 
Also, it should be pointed out that Teledyne uses a flexible strap to connect 
the end of the helix to the center conductor. This prevents movements of the center 
conductor (because of thermal expansion and contraction) from being transmitted 
to the helix. 
 
14.2.2   Attenuators and Severs 
 
The sketch in Figure 14-17 is meant to illustrate a TWT having no attenuators or 
severs. The limiting gain of this device may be readily estimated. If the reflection 
coefficients at the output and input terminals of the TWT are, respectively, Ïo and

Although the tube may be very well matched to the signal source and to the 
load, there will normally be reflections at input and output terminals because of 
the difficulty in making impedance transitions from the RF structure. As a result, it 
may be difficult to make Ïo and Ïi much greater than 10 dB (10% reflections). If 
the cold loss of the circuit is on the order of 6 dB, then the limiting gain is on the 
order of 26 dB. 
 
To prevent large variations in gain with frequency, the actual gain cannot be 
as high as 26 dB and, in fact, is sometimes limited to about 20 dB. To permit 
increased gain, attenuators and severs are used in TWTs. 
 
A common form of attenuation is shown in Figure 14-18. Portions of the 
support rods for a helix are coated with a lossy material. The thickness of the film 
is tapered to zero at the ends of the attenuation region to obtain a good impedance 
match over a wide range of frequencies.

Forward waves as well as backward waves are attenuated by the lossy film. 
However, we must remember that Pierce showed that the reduction in gain is only 
about one-third of the attenuation in the backward wave. Also, the loss in gain in 
the forward direction may be compensated for by an increase in length of the 
interaction region. 
 
Unfortunately, if a good impedance match is to be realized, the attenuator 
must extend for a considerable length along the RF structure and, where there is 
significant attenuation, the amplitude of the circuit wave is small. As a result, the 
circuit fields control of the bunching process and the velocity spread in the beam 
increases. The increase in velocity spread results in less effective bunching after 
the attenuation and a reduction in efficiency. As a result, at high-power levels and, 
especially, when efficiency is important, one or more severs like that illustrated in 
Figure 14-19 may be used to suppress the backward wave.

The sever prevents reflections from the load and the output terminal from 
reaching the input terminal. Although the forward growing wave on the input 
section of the helix is lost at the sever, current and velocity modulation remain on 
the electron beam to carry the signal across the sever region for further 
amplification in the output section. 
 
As the beam drifts across the sever region, bunching degrades and affects the 
final efficiency of the tube. As a result, the sever region should be as short as 
possible. Also, the amount of degradation depends on the intensity of bunching in 
the input section of the slow wave structure. Thus, for maximum efficiency, the 
gain of the input section should be relatively low and the gain of the output section 
should be as high as possible. 
 
Just as there is a limit of about 20 dB to the practical gain of a tube without a 
sever, there is a similar limit to the gain of each section of a tube with severs. 
Referring again to Figure 14-19, the reflection coefficients at the output, Ïo, at the 
sever, Ïs, and at the input, Ïi, along with the circuit attenuations Lo and Li, must be 
taken into consideration in determining gain levels. Because it is usually possible 
to keep the reflection coefficients at the sever terminations less than those for the 
input and output, the gain per section of a severed tube can be higher than that for 
a single-section tube. On the other hand, there is some signal loss in the sever 
region so that an overall gain from a two-section tube of about 40 dB is practical. 
With additional severs, higher gains are possible 
 
A cross-sectional view of a broadband TWT containing an impedance 
transition, attenuators, and a sever is shown in Figure 14-20. The impedance 
transition at the output is made by varying the height of the waveguide in steps. 
The attenuators are made by depositing lossy material on the dielectric support 
rods for the helix. The sever occurs where the circuit is physically divided into two 
sections. Lossy terminations are used to absorb signals reflected by the sever. 
 
 
14.3   POWER 
 
Although a peak power of 10 kW has been demonstrated for a helix TWT [4], 
peak power is usually limited to a few kilowatts. At the end of this chapter, TWTs 
with ring-bar and ring-loop slow wave structures are discussed. These structures 
are said to be derived from helices. Ring-bar and ring-loop TWTs are capable of 
peak powers of tens of kilowatts. 
 
The average power of the helix TWT depends on the frequency of operation 
because size scales inversely with frequency. At low frequencies, average powers 
in the kilowatt range are possible. In the millimeter range, average power is 
limited to tens of watts. 
 
In this section, the reasons for the peak and average power limitations are 
discussed.

14.3.1   Peak Power  
 
A major problem that limits the peak power of helix TWTs is backward wave 
oscillations (BWO). When these oscillations occur, there is a reduction in power at 
the desired frequency of operation and so the oscillations produce in-band power 
holes. In addition, the BWO signal may induce oscillations or may intermodulate 
with the main signal to produce spurious signals inside the operating band. Before 
discussing the reasons for the limits on peak power, it is important to have an 
understanding of backward wave oscillations. 
 
The BWO problem can be explained with the aid of Figure 14-21. At a 
frequency where the electron transit angle from turn to turn is 180Â°, there are two 
turns per wavelength or 180Â° per turn and a backward wave interaction can occur. 
Consider electrons near the helix moving to the right (designated by e) and a 
backward wave moving to the left. Electrons are initially accelerated as indicated 
by the arrow representing force (F) in Figure 14-21(a). These electrons experience 
essentially no force 180Â° later (Figure 14-21(b)) because the wave has moved to 
the left 180Â° and the nulls in the electric field are on the same side of the helix as 
the electrons. When the electrons have moved another 180Â° to the right while the 
wave has moved another 180Â° to the left (Figure 14-21(c)), acceleration again 
occurs.

Similarly, and not shown in Figure 14-21, electrons that are initially 
decelerated experience no forces 180Â° later and then are decelerated when they 
have moved another 180Â°. Thus, there is bunching even though the wave on the 
helix moves in the opposite direction from the electrons, so backward wave 
interaction can take place. If the backward wave interaction is sufficiently intense, 
oscillations occur. 
 
In Figure 14-21, to illustrate the BWO phenomenon, an electron was chosen 
that is moving close to the helix. However, notice that an electron traveling along 
the axis doesnât experience a net accelerating force (or decelerating force) as it 
moves from turn to turn because it experiences alternating fields. 
 
From the foregoing discussion, we see that whether or not a tube oscillates in 
the BWO mode depends primarily on beam current and how close the beam is to 
the helix. An illustration of this dependency is shown in Figure 14-22 [5]. 
 
Now that the BWO problem has been discussed, the reasons why this problem 
limits peak power can be explained. For maximum gain, operation of the helix 
should be around four turns per wavelength, so the helix diameter is restricted. The 
beam diameter is further restricted to avoid oscillations and to limit beam 
interception. Beam current is limited to avoid oscillations. Current is also limited 
by the need to avoid an excessive current density and excessive space charge 
forces that limit the effectiveness of the bunching process and the efficiency of 
operation (see Chapter 12). 
 
Since current is limited, the only way to achieve high-power operation is to 
operate at high voltages. However, as beam voltage is increased, the phase 
velocity of the helix must be increased, which means that the helix pitch must be 
increased. As pitch is increased, two things happen.

First, to maintain about four turns per wavelength, the helix diameter must be 
decreased, so, for a given beam size, the possibility of oscillations is increased. 
This forces a reduction in beam size and current and a reduction in power 
capability. Second, as pitch is increased, the electric fields interacting with the 
beam are decreased, making the tube more prone to oscillations. 
 
Before discussing techniques for suppressing BWO, it is interesting to 
observe that, because the BWO frequency is such that the beam has a 180Â° transit 
angle from turn to turn, the BWO frequency is tunable with beam voltage. In fact, 
tubes designed for operation in the BWO mode can be voltage tuned over a 
reasonably broad range of frequencies. Shown in Figure 14-23 are the essential 
elements of a helix backward wave oscillator, which is simply called a BWO.  
 
Most significant, perhaps, is the electron-gun assembly with a ring-shaped 
cathode for generating a hollow electron beam. The use of a hollow electron beam 
traveling close to the helix structure enhances the backward wave interaction. 
 
Helix BWOs are low-power devices typically generating tens of milliwatts. 
Operating frequencies extend well into the millimeter frequency range. These 
devices have, for the most part, been replaced by solid-state signal sources. 
 
The most common technique for suppressing backward wave oscillations is to 
introduce a change in the slow wave circuit that changes the phase velocity. This 
can be done by changing the diameter of the helix, the number of helix support 
rods, or, as shown in Figure 14-24, the pitch of the helix [6]. In this case, the 
relatively small pitch of the right-hand side of the helix is such that energy is 
transferred from the beam to the backward wave and oscillations occur. As the 
backward wave travels to the left, it encounters a helix section with a larger pitch. 
Thus, the wave travels faster and, if the pitch is correct, the wave travels at the 
velocity of the fast space charge wave. As a result, energy is transferred from the 
backward wave back into the beam and the backward wave is attenuated.

Another method for suppressing backward wave oscillations is the 
introduction of frequency-sensitive attenuation into the helix circuit. A technique 
developed by Varian Associates (now CPI) for producing frequency-sensitive loss 
is illustrated in Figure 14-25 [6]. Varian refers to this loss as resonant loss. 
Meander-line circuits are placed on the support rods in the regions between turns 
of the helix. The circuits are fabricated using standard microwave integrated 
circuit technology. The total length of each line is equal to half the wavelength at 
the BWO frequency so that the lowest resonant frequency is the BWO frequency.

The amount of loss that can be introduced with the resonant loss technique 
can be several tens of decibels. The power output for a 10-kW helix tube designed 
for operation in the 3.0- to 6.0-GHz range is shown in Figure 14-26 [4]. The BWO 
frequency of this tube was just above the top end of the band at about 8.0 GHz. 
Note the very sharp drop in power at the high end of the band where resonant loss 
becomes effective. 
 
A problem that has been identified in using resonant loss is that a harmonic of 
the signal being amplified by the TWT may be at the frequency for which the 
resonant loss circuits have been designed. As a result, the resonant loss structures 
can be destroyed.

14.3.2   Average Power 
 
The helix of a TWT is a relatively delicate structure. As an example, a 
cross-section is shown in Figure 14-28 for the helix of the 10-kW TWT described 
above, which was designed to operate from 3.0 to 6.0 GHz. The helix is made of 
0.010-inch by 0.075-inch tungsten tape. If the TWT is to be rugged and capable of 
operating at high average-power levels, this helix must be very well supported. 
 
The use of metallic supports is out of the question because of their effect on 
the RF characteristics of the circuit. A dielectric cylinder completely surrounding 
the helix could conceivably provide excellent support and cooling. Unfortunately, 
the dielectric constants of suitable ceramic materials are high. As a result, their use 
in a cylinder would severely reduce the circuit interaction impedance of the helix. 
In fact, to minimize the loading effect of a ceramic support structure, it is 
necessary to minimize the amount of ceramic material used. As a result, thin, 
rectangular support rods like those shown in Figure 14-28 are often used. Even 
these load the helix to some extent, as is indicated by the data plotted in Figure 
14-29. 
 
Two dielectric materials are widely used for supporting the helices of TWTs: 
beryllium oxide (BeO) and anisotropic pyrolytic boron nitride (APBN). As shown 
in Figure 14-30, these two materials have relatively high thermal conductivity. It 
should be noted that diamond has an outstanding thermal conductivity and this is 
why there has been strong interest in using diamond for many years.

With the use of high thermal conductivity ceramics, the temperature drop 
across the support rods is not a severe problem in high-power helix TWTs. 
Instead, the major problems are the thermal resistances of the interfaces between 
the helix and the support rods and between the support rods and the barrel. In the 
example shown in Figure 14-31, the thermal drops across these interfaces account 
for 70% of the total temperature difference between the hottest point on the helix 
and the barrel. The temperature drops across the interfaces are extremely 
dependent on the pressure applied to the interface as is shown in Figure 14-32. 
Also, the surface finishes of the materials in contact are important.

Because of the large thermal drops at the support rod interfaces, the helix and 
support rod structures in high-power helix TWTs must be assembled using 
techniques that minimize the thermal interface resistances. Four of the techniques 
that are used are: 
 
 
â¢ 
Triangulation; 
 
â¢  
Pressure or hot insertion; 
 
â¢ 
Wire wrapping; 
 
â¢  
Brazing. 
 
 
With triangulation, the metal barrel that surrounds the helix is slightly 
distorted into a triangular shape. The helix with three equally spaced support rods 
is then inserted into the barrel and the distorting forces on the barrel are removed. 
The higher the resulting forces are at the interfaces between the support rods and 
the helix or barrel, the lower the thermal resistances are. A limit is reached, 
however, when the forces are high enough to distort the helix excessively. For 
helix strength, the material normally used is tungsten or molybdenum. 
 
It should be pointed out that with the triangulation technique the barrel is not a 
solid brazed structure (like that shown in Figure 14-11). Instead, it is a relatively 
thin metallic tube over which the magnetic pole pieces are slid after the helix has 
been inserted. With this technique, there is a relatively poor thermal interface 
between the barrel and the pole pieces. This problem is alleviated by making the 

Helix TWTs 
 
387 
pole pieces fit as tightly as possible on the barrel. Then, as the helix and barrel 
expand because of heating, the contact between the barrel and pole pieces 
improves so heat transfer improves. 
 
With the insertion technique, the helix and rod assembly is inserted into a 
barrel structure like that shown in Figure 14-11. In some cases, the barrel is 
slightly expanded by heating before the helix and rod assembly is inserted. This is 
referred to as hot insertion. In other cases, the helix and rod assembly are 
machined with tolerances for an interference fit and then inserted under high 
pressure into the cold barrel. The temperatures given in Figure 14-31 are for a 
pressure-inserted structure. As with the triangulation technique, the helix materials 
used are tungsten or molybdenum. 
 
With wire wrapping, a tungsten helix that may be copper plated is held in 
compression by support rods (usually four) that are wrapped with wire under high 
tension. This ensures that uniform pressure is applied to all portions of the helix. 
This technique simplifies fabrication and assembly of high-frequency tubes [7].    
 
The most effective way of reducing the thermal interface resistances is by 
brazing. While brazing sounds attractive, it can be difficult to implement. If rods 
that have been metallized on the surfaces to be brazed are used, there are 
difficulties with thermal expansion problems. Also, the support rods must be 
brazed to every turn of the helix. There may be several tens of contact points of 
one support rod with a helix and several support rods (usually three). Every 
contact point of every rod must be brazed for proper protection of the helix. After 
brazing, the metallization of the support rods must be removed in the regions 
between turns of the helix. 
 
With the brazing technique, a wider choice of helix materials is possible than 
with the triangulation or pressure-insertion techniques. In addition to tungsten or 
molybdenum, copper can be used. While tungsten and molybdenum can be 
copper-plated to reduce RF losses, only the use of pure copper throughout the 
helix leads to the maximum possible transfer of heat and the ultimate loss 
reduction. Finally, it should be pointed out that, in brazed structures, the helix is 
mechanically bonded to the dielectric support material. There is reduced 
probability, therefore, that helix failure will result from overheating of the helix 
and the resulting possible loss of thermal contact between the helix and the 
dielectric. 
 
An alternative to the use of brazed rods is the block-supported structure in 
Figure 14-33 [8]. Individual ceramic blocks are brazed to the helix and, usually, to 
the barrel. The use of ceramic blocks eliminates the thermal expansion problems 
associated with rods. 
 
Additional advantages of the block-supported structure are reduced dielectric 
loading (and higher interaction impedance) and a reduced effect of the dielectric 
material on phase velocity. As an example of the capability made possible by 
block-supporting, Thomson Tubes Electroniques (now Thales) produces a 1.5-kW 
average power, 6-GHz TWT for communications service.

Comparisons of the advantages of various techniques are often misleading 
because test conditions differ. Still, because of the continuing emphasis on higher 
powers at higher frequencies, it is important to compare the techniques. A 
comparison of the triangulation, pressure-insertion, and brazing techniques is 
given in Figure 14-34 [9]. The base-plate temperature for the test fixture in these 
tests was 100Â°C. Thus, the temperature rise of the brazed helix (which was copper) 
was about two-thirds of that for the insertion (shrunk) technique and about one 
half of that for the triangulation technique. 
 
It is important to note that the results in Figure 14-34 were obtained by 
passing a dc current through the helices. RF losses and at least a small amount of 
additional heating are therefore not included. The additional heating may be larger 
in the metallized, brazed helix than in the other two.  
 
In general, TWT dimensions scale with wavelength. At millimeter-wave 
frequencies, dimensions become extremely small and miniaturized helices and 
support rods are used. For example, rectangular support rods having 
cross-sectional dimensions of 0.010 inch by 0.020 inch, or smaller, are common. 
As helix assemblies become smaller, heat dissipation problems become more 
severe, and the thermal management techniques described in the previous sections 
become even more important than they are at lower frequencies. 
 
The brazing technique, which offers excellent thermal capabilities, is very 
difficult to implement in the millimeter-wave range. As a result, at present, 
pressure insertion is widely used and average power levels are limited to about 100 
watts.

The use of diamond may make possible significant improvements in average 
power capability. Type II-A diamond has a thermal conductivity several times that 
of copper. With diamond supports, it is predicted that average power levels as high 
as 200W may be achievable at frequencies as high as 50 GHz [10]. 
 
 
14.4   EFFICIENCY 
 
In applications for TWTs where prime power is at a premium, efficient operation 
is essential. The efficiency of TWTs for space operation has increased steadily 
since their first use on satellites and, as is shown in Figure 14-35 for a Ku-band 
device, has passed the 70% mark [11]. Figure 14-36 shows 65% efficiency for an 
L-band device [12]. These are remarkable achievements because the basic 
electronic efficiency (the efficiency of conversion of beam power to RF power on 
the helix) for a typical helix TWT is on the order of 20% at best. 
 
The impact of the high-efficiency devices in Figure 14-35 on the spacecraft 
power system is compared with solid-state power amplifiers (SSPAs) in Figure 
14-37. For the same RF power output, the dc input required by the SSPA is nearly 
three times that of the TWTA (the TWT plus its power conditioning system). 
When radiation cooled TWTs are used, the waste heat that must be dissipated by 
the spacecraft is over an order of magnitude below that for SSPAs. When these 
power considerations are combined with the demonstrated superior reliability of 
TWTs compared with SSPAs [13], it is clear why TWTs are the amplifiers of 
choice for spacecraft applications.

The achievement of 70% efficiency in a helix TWT requires great attention to 
detail in the design and fabrication of all aspects of the electron optics system and 
the RF structure. Most important, perhaps, is the use a multistage depressed 
collector for recovering the power remaining in the electron beam after it has 
interacted with the RF structure. These collectors are discussed in Chapter 16.  
 
The design of the RF circuit must be optimized for several factors at the same 
time. These include electronic efficiency, circuit efficiency, collector efficiency 
(the energy distribution of the electrons entering the collector must be controlled), 
and linearity.

Circuit efficiency is the efficiency with which the helix delivers the RF power 
generated in the TWT to the output port. Circuit efficiency is important because 
power lost to heating the circuit is no longer available in the electron beam for 
recovery by the collector. Collector efficiency is the efficiency with which the 
collector recovers power from the electron beam leaving the interaction region of 
the TWT. Figure 14-38 shows that an increase in circuit efficiency of 10% will 
result in an increase in overall efficiency of ~5% when an efficient collector is 
used.  
 
Circuit efficiency is dependent primarily on the effective resistance of the 
circuit material. At high frequencies, dielectric losses are also important. 
Comparisons of measured and theoretical loss for a copper-plated helix are given 
in Figure 14-39. 
 
The dashed curves of Figure 14-39 are calculated loss curves based on the 
bulk resistivity of copper (1.724Ã10â6 â¦-cm) and based on the best fit to 
experimental data at the frequencies where reflections in the measurement 
circuitry were small and a resistivity of 4Ã10â6 â¦-cm was assumed. The circled 
data points are measured losses and the solid curve is the calculated loss for a 
resistivity of 4Ã10â6 â¦-cm, taking into consideration reflections in the 
measurement circuitry. The excellent fit of the theoretical curves to data when a 
resistivity of 4Ã10â6 â¦-cm is assumed leads to the conclusion that 4Ã10â6 â¦-cm 
was the effective resistivity of the copper surface of the helix. This value is more 
than twice the bulk resistivity of copper.

The reason for the high effective resistivity is indicated in Figure 14-40, 
which contains photomicrographs of the surface of the copper-plated helix [14]. 
The skin depth at 10 GHz was small compared with the sizes of the irregularities 
on the orange-peel textured copper surface. As a result, the path length for the RF 
current and the effective resistance were much larger than for a smooth surface. To 
minimize resistance and loss, it is essential to properly polish the helix surface.

One of the very unfortunate aspects of the requirements placed on RF 
amplifiers for some communications applications, whether they are TWTs or solid 
state, is that there is very little tolerance for nonlinearities in the amplification 
process. To operate with acceptable linearity, operation of the amplifiers has to be 
âbacked off.â This means that the amplifiers must be operated at power levels well 
below their maximum capabilities. The amount of back-off depends on the RF 
modulation scheme as shown in Figure 14-41. If frequency modulation (FM) is 
used, operation at saturation is possible and the amplifiers can operate at 
maximum efficiency. For some of the phase shift keying (PSK) applications, the 
back-off required for acceptable operation is on the order of 4 dB. For various 
amplitude modulation schemes, which are coupled with phase modulation (QAM, 
for example), the back-off requirement can be on the order of 12 dB or more. 
 
TWTs can be and are operated in the back-off mode, but the overall efficiency 
is below the values of 70% or more that are realized for operation at saturation. 
Examples of the degradation in efficiency that can occur at reduced power levels 
are shown in Figure 14-36 and Figure 14-42. (Here efficiency was not necessarily 
optimized for operation below saturation.) 
 
At 10 or more decibels below saturation, power usage that would normally be 
considered to be nearly insignificant becomes important. An example is the power 
for heating the cathode. This could be eliminated with a cold cathode. Losses due 
to secondary emission effects in the collector would have to be reduced. Beam 
interception would have to be virtually eliminated. If these losses, as well as power 
conditioning losses could be all but eliminated, very efficient operation at 10 or 
more decibels below saturation could be achieved.

14.5   DUAL-MODE OPERATION 
 
The purpose of a dual-mode TWT is to provide two different RF power levels 
(separated by as much as 10 dB) efficiently in a single device. This is important in 

Helix TWTs 
 
395 
airborne electronic countermeasures systems, for example, where volume and 
weight must usually be minimized. In these systems, the use of two tubes, each of 
which is designed for operation at one of the power levels, often results in 
excessive system weight and volume. There are basically three ways in which a 
single tube can be efficiently operated at two power levels: 
 
 
1. Beam current and voltage are held constant and RF drive level is 
changed. Efficiency is obtained by using a multistage depressed collector 
to recover spent-beam power. This technique is discussed further in 
Chapter 16. 
 
2. A complex tube, basically consisting of two tubes in one envelope, is 
used. A drawing of a device of this type is shown in Figure 14-43. The 
tube consists of a conventional TWT in series with a very short, low gain 
(10 dB), nearly lossless device. In the low-power mode, the beam in the 
10-dB device (sometimes referred to as a transparent tube) is turned off 
and the signal from the conventional TWT passes through it with no 
amplification and little loss. In the high-power mode, the transparent tube 
is turned on to provide an additional 10 dB of gain. This device has the 
advantage of providing a full 10 dB of pulse-up capability and the 
disadvantage of being more complex and heavier than the single-tube 
device. 
 
3. Beam current is varied with a gridded electron gun. (Beam voltage is not 
changed because of the weight and complexity of a modulator and 
because the beam velocity must remain near synchronism with the circuit 
phase velocity.) 
 
 
The third technique (changing beam current) for achieving dual-mode 
operation is difficult to implement when the power separation between modes 
must be more than a few decibels. One difficulty encountered is that of focusing 
both the low-power and the high-power beams with the same magnet structure. 
 
Assuming constant efficiency, beam power and beam current must vary in 
direct proportion to RF power. If beam diameter is held constant, then beam 
charge density varies directly with beam current. Finally, the radial electric field in 
the beam is proportional to the charge density and, therefore, to the power level. If 
the PPM structure is designed for the low-power mode, the magnetic field will be 
inadequate to offset the electric field in the high-power mode. Of course, the 
opposite situation exists if the PPM structure is designed for the high-power mode. 
This problem may be alleviated by changing the beam diameter when the beam 
current is changed. 
 
The other difficulty encountered when the beam current is changed is that the 
beam impedance changes and this changes Pierceâs gain parameter, C. As a result, 
the RF characteristics of the tube change with beam current, making it difficult to 
obtain the desired performance at two power levels that differ by a large amount.

14.6   MICROWAVE POWER MODULES [15] 
 
A solid-state amplifier (SSA) can have an extremely low noise figure but cannot 
efficiently produce high RF power. On the other hand, a TWT can efficiently 
deliver high power but does not have such a low noise capability. In a microwave 
power module (MPM), as shown in Figure 14-44, advantage is taken of both the 
SSA and the TWT. Gain is divided approximately equally between these two 
devices. The SSA and TWT are combined with a power conditioner in a single 
package that is highly miniaturized and can be designed to operate in the 
microwave or millimeter-wave frequency bands. 
 
As shown in Figure 14-44, in addition to low noise, the SSA is small and has 
functionality, that is, it has strong signal processing capabilities. In addition to 
high power, the TWT is capable of operating efficiently over a wide band of 
frequencies. The power conditioner delivers low voltage to the SSA and high 
voltage to the TWT with high efficiency. Special transformers have been 
developed, which are very compact and have form factors that make it possible for 
them to fit into the very compact MPM packages. 
 
The development of MPMs began in 1991 as a Tri-Service initiative. The 
original specifications that were set as a goal for the program are listed in Table 
14.1. Notice, in particular, that the power levels were ~100W at noise figures of 10 
dB or lower.

As pointed out in [15], the Tri-Service investment has brought forth a new 
miniaturized RF amplifier capability for the RF electronics industry. Now, in 
addition to the military applications, MPMs are being developed for commercial 
use such as satellite uplinks, line-of-site terrestrial links, and local multipoint 
distribution service.

An example of a wide band MPM, dubbed the âultraband MPMâ by Northrop 
Corp. is the 125W (minimum), 4.5â18-GHz device with dimensions of 8.3 inches 
by 4.8 inches by 1.0 inch and weighing 3.6 lbs [15]. The power and gain 
characteristics of the TWT used in this MPM are shown in Figure 14-45. The gain 
variation of this device is offset by the SSA to produce a nearly constant power 
output over the entire frequency range. As Figure 14-46 shows, the efficiency of 
the ultraband MPM is as high as 45%.

14.7   RING BAR and RING LOOP TWTs 
 
The ring-bar circuit in Figure 14-47(a) was developed to make possible the high-
power operation of a helix-type circuit. Basically, the ring-bar circuit is derived 
from the contrawound helix shown in Figure 14-47(b) and is far easier to fabricate. 
In another similar circuit, the ring-loop circuit, the rings are connected by loops 
rather than bars.

Figure 14-47   (a) Ring-bar and (b) two-tape contrawound helix circuits.  
 
 
These circuits, originally described by Chodorow and Chu [16], suppress 
backward wave oscillations and can be operated at higher voltages than a single 
helix. Also, because BWO is suppressed, it is possible to fill more of the helix 
tunnel with the electron beam so a larger beam with more current can be used. The 
penalty for these advantages is that the bandwidth is less than that of a single 
helix. 
 
To understand the operation of these circuits and how they suppress backward 
wave interactions, it is helpful to examine the bifilar helix shown in Figure 14-48 
and to compare its characteristics with those of a single helix. The pitch of the 
helices making up the bifilar helix is the same as that of the single helix. For the 
moment, interactions between the two helices of the bifilar and single helices are 
assumed to be the same. As a result, for a given frequency, the voltage 
distributions indicated in Figure 14-48 for the single helix and the bifilar helix are 
the same. For the BWO discussion, these have been chosen so as to be those 
associated with two turns per wavelength. 
 
The interaction of electrons with a backward wave on a single helix was 
discussed earlier in this chapter. To review, electrons that are initially accelerated 
(top left, Figure 14-48) experience essentially no forces 180Â° later (middle left) 
and then are accelerated again 360Â° later (bottom left). Similarly, and not shown in 
Figure 14-48, electrons that are initially decelerated experience no forces 180Â° 
later and then are decelerated 360Â° later. Thus, there is bunching and gain, even 
though the wave on the helix moves in the opposite direction from the electrons. 
 
For the bifilar helix shown in Figure 14-48, it is assumed that the electrons 
and waves have the same velocities as for the single helix. In this case, however, 
electrons that are initially accelerated (top right) are decelerated 180Â° later (center 
right) and then accelerated again 360Â° later (bottom right). Because, on each cycle, 
the accelerating and decelerating forces tend to cancel each other, there is no net

gain that can lead to backward wave oscillations. As a result, higher operating 
voltages, currents, and RF power levels are possible with the bifilar helix than with 
the single helix (with no suppression techniques being used). The same arguments 
apply to the contrawound helix and to the ring-bar and ring-loop circuits, so these 
circuits can operate without BWO at much higher voltages than can the single 
helix.

Figure 14-48   Backward wave interaction on a single and a bifilar helix for two turns per 
wavelength. 
 
 
An Ï-Î² diagram for a ring-bar circuit is shown in Figure 14-49 [17]. The 
forward wave characteristic is more dispersive that for a single helix. The point 
where the beam velocity, uo, line crosses the forward wave line establishes the 
synchronous voltage and provides an indication of the bandwidth of the circuit 
which is typically 10% to 30%. This voltage is high enough so that the backward 
wave at the frequency fÏ is not excited. 
 
The design of the ring-bar and ring-loop circuits are more complex than a 
helix because the phase velocity is controlled by the width and length of the bar or 
the loop. Reference [18] describes progress in designing these circuits. Figure 
14-50 shows the variation of phase velocity with frequency for a millimeter wave 
tube [17]. At the center of the operating band, the phase velocity is approximately 
25% of the speed of light and the operating voltage is about 18 kV.  
 
Figure 14-51 contains a plot of the power and bandwidth capabilities of an X-
band ring-bar TWT. Note that the power is very constant over a bandwidth of  
nearly 20%. Ring-bar TWTs are capable of very high-powers at lower frequencies. 
Examples are the QKW1617(A) and the QKW1818, which were made by 
Raytheon and had power capabilities of 160-kW peak and 10-kW average [19].

Coupled-Cavity TWTs 
 
 
In coupled-cavity TWTs [1, 2], several tens of klystronlike cavities are used for 
the slow wave structure. Except for sever regions, these cavities are 
electromagnetically coupled so that an RF signal can propagate along the 
structure. Coupling techniques take on widely differing forms and are discussed in 
this chapter. If an electron beam is passed through the structure and if it has a 
velocity near the phase velocity of the circuit, then amplification can occur. 
 
With appropriate choices of cavity dimensions and cavity-coupling 
techniques, electron beam velocity can be high, and operation at high peak-power 
levels is possible. Also, coupled-cavity structures are mostly metallic (copper and 
iron) and have geometries such that thermal resistances are very low. As a result, 
high average powers are possible. 
 
Shown in Figure 15-1 are the major components of a coupled-cavity TWT 
that is PPM focused. The operation of the electron gun was described in Chapter 6, 
and multistage collectors are discussed in Chapter 16. A qualitative explanation of 
the interaction of the electron beam with the coupled-cavity circuit is given in the 
following section.

15.1   BASIC OPERATING PRINCIPLES 
 
Figure 15-2 is useful in describing the operation of a coupled-cavity TWT. The 
input circuit supplies a signal to the first cavity through a magnetic coupling loop 
or an impedance-matching section from a waveguide. That signal produces a 
voltage V1 across the gap in the first cavity and also is coupled from the first cavity 
to the second (from A to B through one of several coupling structures to be 
described in the following paragraphs). The voltage across the first gap modulates 
the electron beam velocity so that an ac component of current develops as the 
beam moves toward the second cavity. The beam induces a signal into the second 
cavity, which splits into two equal wavelets, one traveling to the right and the 
other to the left. The reverse traveling waves from cavity 2 and from subsequent 
cavities are eliminated by loss or severs not shown in Figure 15-2.

The voltage induced in the second cavity by the beam combines with the 
voltage fed forward from the first gap through the coupling structure to produce 
voltage V2 across the second gap. This voltage enhances the velocity modulation 
of the beam, thereby increasing the ac current in the beam. This process is 
repeated at subsequent gaps with each gap voltage being the combination of the 
voltage coupled from the previous gap and the sum of all the components induced 
by the ac beam current. The ac beam current at any point is the sum of all the 
currents produced by previous gaps. 
 
One of several techniques can be used to couple RF energy from cavity to 
cavity. Before discussing coupling structures in general terms, it is of value to 
discuss the complexity of the coupling process. Figure 15-3 shows an example of 
cavity-to-cavity coupling. Here, the coupling is accomplished with slots in the 
plate between two cavities.  

Coupled-Cavity TWTs 
 
407 
 
Assume, at first, that there is no signal in the cavities so all currents and 
electric fields are zero. When an RF signal is injected into cavity 1 (with a 
magnetic coupling loop for example), current I1 flows and this produces electric 
field Es1 across the slot. The slot field in cavity 2 is the same as that in cavity 1. To 
produce this field, I2 must flow in cavity 2. The charge separations that the current 
flows produce establish electric fields Eg1 and Eg2 across the cavity gaps. These are 
the fields that interact with the electron beam. It should be noticed that the field 
across gap 2 is opposite to that across gap 1. For a bunching action that is initiated 
in gap 1 to be reinforced in gap 2, the beam velocity must be such that the gap 2 
voltage reverses phase before the bunch arrives.

Figure 15-3   Example of coupling of signal from cavity to cavity. 
 
 
In the TWT shown in Figure 15-1, each cavity is coupled to the following 
cavity and to the preceding cavity with a kidney-shaped slot. The two slots in each 
cavity are 180Â° apart in rotational position so this circuit can be viewed as a folded 
waveguide. In fact, many of the properties of this circuit are most easily 
understood by treating it as a folded waveguide. As a result, in the following 
discussions of Ï-Î² characteristics, vane-loaded waveguides and folded waveguides 
are considered first. 
 
While the waveguide approach is useful for a qualitative understanding of 
dispersion characteristics, a circuit model approach is most useful for a detailed 
examination of Ï-Î² characteristics. The equivalent circuits described by Curnow 
[3, 4] and Gittins [5] are sometimes used for modeling coupled-cavity structures. 
The discussion of these circuits follows the waveguide discussion.

15.2   COUPLED-CAVITY STRUCTURES 
 
15.2.1   Waveguide Approach 
 
It is convenient to start the discussion of coupled-cavity structures with the 
dispersion characteristics of a waveguide. A vane-loaded waveguide discussed in 
Chapter 13 is shown in Figure 15-4. To examine the interaction of waves in the 
guide with an electron beam, consider a single electron following the serpentine 
path shown in Figure 15-4.

Figure 15-4   Serpentine electron path through vaned waveguide. 
 
 
Assume first that the electron travels from A to B in the same time that the 
wave crest in the guide travels from A to B. With respect to the direction of 
motion of the electron, a 180Â° phase reversal takes place in the electric field. Thus, 
as âseenâ by the electron, the Ï-Î² diagram is shifted by Ï radians as shown in 
Figure 15-5. An obvious problem with the example given here is that the electron 
would have to travel faster than the speed of light to move from A to B in the time 
that the wave does. This problem can be alleviated by folding the waveguide as 
shown in Figure 15-6. Assuming that no additional impedance changes occur, then 
the Ï-Î² diagram for the wave is not changed. From the perspective of the electron, 
the phase velocity of the wave and the electron velocity from A to B along path L 
is important, and so Î²Lw must be replaced by Î²L on the abscissa of Figure 15-5 to 
consider electron interaction. 
 
An electron accelerated at A in Figure 15-6 can again be accelerated at B if: 
 
 
1. The direction of wave propagation is reversed, and the electron velocity is 
adjusted so that the electron arrives at B when an inverted wave crest 
traveling from the right does (see Figure 15-7(a)). This is a backward 
wave interaction and is indicated by arrow 1 on the Ï-Î² diagram in Figure 
15-5(b). The transit angle of the electron for this interaction is about Ï/2 
rad.

2. The electron velocity is reduced so that the next inverted wave crest 
traveling to the right arrives at B when the electron does. This is a 
forward wave interaction and is indicated by arrow 2 in Figure 15-5(b). 
For this interaction to occur, the transit angle of the electron is about 3Ï/2 
rad. 
 
 
The operation of the folded waveguide discussed in the preceding paragraphs 
is similar to that of a large class of coupled-cavity TWTs, which includes the TWT 
shown in Figure 15-1. The circuits used in these TWTs are referred to as 
fundamental backward wave circuits. 
 
Another class of coupled-cavity TWTs uses structures referred to as 
fundamental forward wave circuits. The operation of these circuits may be 
understood with the aid of Figures 15-8 and 15-9. In these circuits, there is a 
mechanism for shifting the phase of the RF signal by 180Â°. The 180Â° twist shown 
in Figure 15-8 is an obvious way to produce the desired phase shift but would be 
virtually impossible to implement in a folded waveguide structure.

The dual-coupling loop shown in Figure 15-9(b) reverses the magnetic field at 
the coupling aperture and, as a result, produces a 180Â° phase shift in the electric 
field. This action may be understood by considering, first, the magnetic field at the 
aperture in the folded guide with vanes. As indicated in Figure 15-9(a), the 
direction of the H field is the same on the two sides of the coupling aperture. In 
Figure 15-9(b), the magnetic field on the left side of the aperture causes current to 
flow in the coupling loops. This current, in turn, produces a magnetic field on the 
right side of the aperture that is the reverse of that on the left. This reversal of the 
magnetic field also produces a reversal of the electric field. An electron that was 
accelerated at A and travels from A to B in the same time that the wave does will 
again be accelerated at B.

The Ï-Î² diagram for the loop coupled structure is shown in Figure 15-10. 
Interaction in this fundamental forward wave structure occurs with electrons at a 
transit angle near Ï/2 rad. It should be noted that this transit angle is much smaller 
than for the fundamental backward wave structure (~3Ï/2 rad). As a result, tubes 
with fundamental forward wave structures operate with faster and, therefore, 
higher voltage, higher-powered electron beams than fundamental backward wave 
tubes. Fundamental forward wave tubes can operate at power levels of several 
megawatts whereas fundamental backward wave tubes operate at kilowatts to tens 
of kilowatts.

15.2.2   Curnow-Gittins Equivalent Circuit Approach 
 
The discussion of Ï-Î² characteristics based on waveguide considerations is useful 
for a qualitative understanding of the dispersion characteristics of coupled-cavity 
circuits. However, detailed analyses, which necessarily use electromagnetic field 
theory, are very difficult because of the complex boundary conditions. Thus, the 
waveguide approach does not provide much insight or guidance concerning the 
dependence of dispersion characteristics on variations in the geometrical 
characteristics of the circuits. Even computer modeling does not help much in 
developing an intuitive understanding of the operation of coupled-cavity circuits. 
However, computer modeling, along with the use of equivalent circuits, can 
provide accurate predictions of the consequences of circuit changes along with an 
understanding of what is happening. 
 
From the very early days of coupled-cavity TWTs, equivalent circuits have 
been used to help explain circuit operation. The most successful of these 
equivalent circuits have been those described by Curnow [3, 4] and Gittins [5]. 
The development of these circuits is based on an examination of the current paths 
in a cavity. In a cavity without coupling apertures, current is distributed uniformly 
as is indicated in Figure 15-11(a). Current flows back and forth from one side of 
the cavity gap to the other through the cavity walls. The gap is the capacitive 
portion of the cavity and the walls are the inductive portion, and so the equivalent 
circuit is in Figure 15-11(b). The resonant frequency is fc.

When coupling slots are placed in the cavity walls, some of the current paths 
are intercepted, as shown in Figure 15-12. In general, there can be four types of 
current paths:

2. Broken by the slot coupling to the preceding cavity (I2);

4. Broken by both coupling slots (I4).

Figure 15-12   (a) Cavity currents used to define the inductance for the equivalent circuit, 
and (b) the equivalent circuit for a slot. 
 
 
The equivalent circuit to represent this distribution of currents can be 
constructed by dividing the cavity inductance, Lc, into four parts: 
 
 
1. Lc/p, where p is the fraction of the current not involved in coupling; 
 
2. 2Lc/k, where k is the fraction involved in coupling to the following cavity; 
 
3. 2Lc/k, where k is the fraction involved in coupling to the preceding cavity; 
 
4. Lc/n, where n is the fraction involved in coupling both ways. 
 
Here, it has been assumed, as is usually the case, that the two coupling slots are the 
same. The total of the four currents is the total cavity current and so 
 
 
 
1
p + k + n =  
(15-1) 
 
The coupling slots can be represented as parallel resonant circuits with 
resonant frequency fs, as shown in Figure 15-12(b). Thus, the cavity with all of its 
equivalent circuit elements is as shown in Figure 15-13. The generalized 
equivalent circuit derived from this cavity is in Figure 15-14. 
 
Using the circuit in Figure 15-14 an expression can be developed for the 
phase shift from cavity to cavity. Using measured values for the resonant 
frequencies of the cavity and the slots and estimates for the current coupling 
fractions, an Ï-Î² diagram can be constructed. Also, the impedance of the circuit 
can be calculated. Then, based on comparisons with experimental Ï-Î² results and 
impedance measurements, the current fraction can be revised so that the equivalent 
circuit is a reasonably accurate model of the cavity.

One of the values of the Curnow-Gittins equivalent circuit is that it provides 
insight into the operation of the cavity. The other is that it provides a way to 
estimate the results in performance characteristics of changes to a coupled-cavity 
structure. For example, if the coupling slots are made longer, the fraction of the 
current that they intercept is increased and so the change in dispersion and 
impedance can be estimated.

15.2.3   Example of an Application of the Curnow-Gittins Circuit 
 
As an example of the use of the Curnow-Gittins equivalent circuit, the staggered-
slot circuit will be examined. This is the circuit used in the TWT shown in Figure 
15-1, and shown more clearly in Figure 15-15. In this circuit, no current paths are 
intercepted by both slots. As a result, the fraction, n, used in the previous section is 
zero and so

circuit is shown in Figure 15-16. Circuits for adjacent cavities are included to 
facilitate the analysis.

the Ï-Î² characteristic can be plotted as shown in Figure 15-19. Here, it has been 
assumed that k = 0.5 and kc = 0.35. 
 
Notice that there are two frequency bands in which propagation can occur. 
The lower one is referred to as the cavity passband because its characteristics are 
controlled largely by the cavity-resonance condition. Similarly, the upper band is 
called the slot passband and its characteristics are controlled mostly by the slot 
resonance condition. 
 
The solid curves in Figure 15-19 are the Ï-Î² characteristics derived for one 
midcavity-to-midcavity cell of the equivalent circuit for the entire coupled-cavity 
structure. Because only one cell is used, results for other portions of the Ï-Î² 
characteristic, such as those shown by the dashed lines in Figure 15-19, are not 
obtained. However, these can be inferred from the discussion of Ï-Î² 
characteristics contained in Chapter 13. Thus, the curves from Ï to 2Ï rad are 
simply mirror images of those from 0 to Ï rad. For the staggered-slot circuit, the 
lower dashed curve, which indicates forward wave interaction, is the Ï-Î² 
characteristic that is needed. 
 
There are several variables in the Curnow-Gittins equations. When changes 
are proposed for a coupled-cavity structure, the effect of these changes on one or 
more of the variables can be estimated, and the change in the dispersion 
characteristic (and interaction impedance) can be predicted.

As an example, changes in the angle, Î¸, of the coupling slot shown in Figure 
15-20 change the percentage of the cavity current involved in coupling (k), change 
the slot inductance (in kc), and change the slot resonant frequency (Ïs). The effect 
of these changes on the dispersion characteristics is shown in Figure 15-21. These 
changes, in turn, affect the cold bandwidth (bandwidth of circuit with no electron 
beam) as shown in Figure 15-22. Changes in the coupling slot angle also change 
the relative positions of the slot and cavity passbands as shown in Figure 15-23. 
Note that, for large coupling angles, the slot passband becomes the lower 
passband.

Again, using values of k = 0.5 and kc = 0.35 and assuming that R/Q = 37, 
impedance can be plotted as shown in Figure 15-24. Note that impedance goes to 
infinity at all cutoff frequencies except for the lower slot-band cutoff frequency, 
where it is zero. For the values of constants used here, the impedance in the cavity 
band where normal operation occurs is a few hundred ohms, which is higher than 
what is normally encountered in staggered-slot TWTs.

Normally, the cavity passband is used for interaction with the electron beam, 
and this was the case for the results in the previous section. It is possible to use the 
slot passband, and tubes designed to operate in this mode have existed for many 
years [6]. An important property of the slot passband is that the interaction 
impedance at the upper cutoff frequency is zero (see Figure 15-24). This results 
from the vanishing axial electric field component on the axis, as is indicated in 
Figure 15-25. As a result, no special oscillation-suppression techniques are 
required at this frequency.

Attempts have been made in [7] to coalesce the cavity band and slot band as 
indicated in Figure 15-23 in an effort to achieve octave-bandwidth operation in 
staggered-slot TWTs. While the Ï-Î² diagram indicates near synchronism of the 
circuit wave and the beam over the desired bandwidth, two difficulties are in-band 
backward wave instability and a large gain variation with frequency. 
 
Once the equivalent circuit model with appropriate component values has 
been established for a coupled-cavity structure, the analysis of the interaction with 
the electron beam can be carried out. The steps of the analysis are conceptually the 
same as those used by Gittins in the vector diagram description of coupled-cavity 
TWT operation. That is, the electron beam induces current into the appropriate 
elements (cavity gaps) of the equivalent circuit, and the electric field of the circuit 
excites current and velocity modulation of the beam. The shapes of the electric 
fields of the circuit and the space charge fields in the beam must be accurately 
determined so that the analysis can properly predict tube performance. 
 
 
15.3   FUNDAMENTAL BACKWARD WAVE OPERATION 
 
Two commonly used fundamental backward wave circuits are illustrated in Figure 
15-26. In each of these, apertures are used to couple the fields from one cavity to 
the next. The staggered-slot structure in Figure 15-26(a) was discussed in the 
previous section.

Elsevier, Inc.) 
 
 
When the slots are aligned, as shown in Figure 15-26(b), all of the circulating 
cavity current that couples to the previous cavity also couples to the following 
cavity. As a result, the aligned-slot structure has properties that are quite different 
than those for the staggered-slot structure. The primary difference is that the 
aligned-slot structure has a smaller bandwidth. However, the shape of the Ï-Î² 
characteristic is such that, for a given frequency of operation, larger cavity 
dimensions are possible with the inline structure and so higher powers are possible 
than with the staggered-slot structure. 
 
An example of the capability of a device with a staggered-slot circuit is shown 
in Figure 15-27. Confined flow solenoid focusing and a depressed collector are 
used. The solid curves show the power output at various drive levels (referenced to 
the 0 dB saturation drive level of 40 mW). The overall efficiency is in the 20% to 
30% range.  
 
Coupled-cavity structures are ideally suited for use in PPM focused TWTs. As 
shown in Figure 15-28, the magnetic pole pieces can be made integral with the 
cavity structure. The pole pieces are copper plated, and copper spacers are used to 
form cavities of the required height. Liquid cooling channels may also be included 
in the coupled-cavity structure. In some cases, the coolant is channeled around the 
drift tubes between cavities to carry away the heat resulting from interception of 
the electron beam.

The TWT, for which the power output is given in Figure 15-29, is an example 
of what can be achieved in a staggered-slot circuit when PPM focusing was used. 
In this case, confined flow PPM focusing was utilized to minimize beam 
interception. With 35G at the cathode, the maximum interception current was less 
than 500 mA (out of a cathode current of 7.65A) so the RF beam transmission was 
93.4% or better. A single-stage depressed collector was used, and the overall 
efficiency at the midband was 33.7%. It is estimated that, with a five-stage 
collector, the efficiency would be 50%.

cycle. (From: Hughes Electron Dynamics Division, Microwave Jour., April 1989.) 
 
 
When periodic permanent magnets are used, the electron beam is not as well 
focused as it is when a solenoid is used. As a result, the percentage of the beam 
current intercepted by the circuit is relatively high, and so the average power 
capability is relatively low. The reduction in average power capability of 
PPM-focused tubes compared with solenoid-focused tubes is typically a factor of 
four or more. 
 
When coupled-cavity technology is extended to millimeter-wave frequencies, 
cavity dimensions become very small. The TWT circuit based on conventional 
cavity technology requires several dozen copper disks per section. Each disk 
contains a coupling slot and ferrules, which form the cavities. The disks are lathe 
turned, preferably by diamond-point machining. The kidney-shaped slots are cut 
by EDM (electric discharge milling). These disks are stacked and heated under 
pressure to braze or sinter them together. 
 
At millimeter-wave frequencies, the problem with this conventional 
construction technique is that it requires the parts to be machined to extremely 
tight tolerances. One reason is that errors in cavity lengths may add cumulatively 
when the cavities are stacked. To maintain synchronism between the beam and 
circuit wave, extremely tight tolerances on the height of each cavity are necessary. 
A second reason is that the cavity resonant frequency is critically dependent on the 
cavity gap width. Machining tolerances on this dimension may be 70 millionths of 
an inch or smaller. 
 
The problem of using a large number of parts machined to extremely tight 
tolerances can be circumvented by using the ladder-circuit designs described later 
in this chapter [8]. With these designs, tolerances are relaxed to 200 millionths of 
an inch. The cost, in turn, is reduced by a factor of about 2. 

Coupled-Cavity TWTs

The ladder circuit is fabricated by machining notches in a slab of copper to 
form a âladderâ or âcombâ structure as is indicated in Figure 15-30. The beam 
tunnel is formed by cutting half-round grooves in the tips of the comb teeth. Two 
identical structures are then brazed together. The circuit is completed by brazing 
cover plates to the faces of the ladder assembly. Because the ferrules, which form 
the drift-tube tips in the cavities, are omitted with the ladder-assembly technique, 
gain per cavity is reduced and so the interaction circuit length is increased. Still, 
the advantage of needing only a few parts per section rather than several dozen is 
considerable.

In [8] three versions of ladder circuits are described: 
 
 
1. In the aligned-slot structure shown in Figure 15-30, the coupling slots 
from cavity to cavity are formed by machining channels in the cover 
plates. 
 
2. In the staggered-slot structure shown in Figure 15-31, slots are machined 
into the edge of every other ladder rung, with the skipped rungs notched 
on the other side. The cover plates are flat slabs of copper. 
 
3. In the double-staggered ladder, two coupling slots spaced 180Â° apart are 
used in each cavity wall. The pair of coupling slots is rotated 90Â° from 
cavity to cavity. 
 
 
As shown in Figure 15-32, there are significant differences between the Ï-Î² 
characteristics for these structures. These differences lead to advantages (or 
disadvantages) that govern the applications of the tubes.

With the aligned-slot design, the slot and cavity modes are coalesced (see the 
discussion of Ï-Î² characteristics previously in this chapter), which allows the use 
of a reduced cavity-resonant frequency and larger cavity dimensions than for the 
staggered-slot circuit. In addition, because of the nature of the Ï-Î² characteristic, a 
larger value of Î²L can be used and so the cavities can be longer than for the 
staggered-slot circuit. These two properties essentially double the power-handling 
capability of the circuit, making it one of the highest power linear-beam 
millimeter-wave circuits available. Figure 15-33 contains power and efficiency 
curves for a tube with a dual aligned-slot circuit. The bandwidth for this tube is 
approximately 1%. Theoretically, it is possible to achieve bandwidths of over 3%, 
depending on operating voltage and perveance. 
 
The double-staggered ladder is the broadest bandwidth circuit of the three 
ladder structures discussed here. This circuit has a demonstrated 20% operating 
bandwidth over the 80- to 100-GHz range with a power output of 100-W CW at 90 
GHz.

The estimated power capability of millimeter-wave TWTs using solenoid-
focused ladder structures is given in Figure 15-34. Results for the VTA-5700 and 
VTW-5795 are shown. When PPM focusing is used, the estimated power 
capability for ladder structures is about an order of magnitude lower than shown in 
Figure 15-34. 
 
The 1989 status of power capabilities of fundamental backward wave 
coupled-cavity TWTs with moderate bandwidth (few percent) are summarized for 
pulsed tubes in Figure 15-35 and for CW tubes in Figure 15-36 [9]. For larger 
bandwidths, the maximum power capability is lower than shown here. In Figure 
15-35, Ek is the electron gun voltage and Ac is the area compression ratio of the 
electron gun. Note that, in these plots, the power capabilities of PPM tubes are 
about a factor of 3 below those for solenoid-focused tubes.

15.4   FUNDAMENTAL FORWARD WAVE OPERATION 
 
 
The centipede (interlaced) structure shown in Figure 15-37 is an implementation 
of the coupling loop scheme discussed at the beginning of the chapter for 
achieving fundamental forward wave operation [10]. Many coupling loops are 
used to maximize coupling and bandwidth. As shown in Figure 15-37(b), the 
height of each cavity must be adequate to accommodate the large coupling loops 
required to maximize coupling. Since the beam transit angle from cavity to cavity 
is only about 90Â°, the electron beam velocity must be high, so the centipede 
structure is suitable for high-power operation.

The cloverleaf structure shown in Figure 15-38, is a fundamental forward- 
wave circuit [10]. This structure was also described Chapter 11 where output 
circuits for klystrons were discussed. The four-lobed cavity distorts the magnetic 
field lines into a cloverleaf pattern. Radial components of the field are coupled 
from cavity to cavity by radial slots. By rotating each cavity 45Â° with respect to 
adjacent cavities, the fields in adjacent cavities are in phase except for a delay of 
approximately 90Â° associated with coupling the signal from cavity to cavity.  
 
The cloverleaf structure is used in high-power TWTs. An example, which was 
developed many years ago and which is shown in Figure 15-39, is the Varian 
VA-125 for which the power output is given in Figure 15-40. Note that output 
powers in excess of 4 MW are obtained.

15.5   TERMINATIONS AND TRANSITIONS 
 
The need for severs in TWTs has been discussed in previous chapters. 
Terminations are required at the severs to minimize reflections. The RF power that 
a termination must dissipate can be appreciable in coupled-cavity TWTs. As a 
result, the termination is normally a lossy ceramic material capable of high-
temperature operation and appropriately bonded to the surrounding metallic 
structures to achieve the required heat dissipation capability. An example of a 
termination for a fundamental forward wave cloverleaf structure is shown in 
Figure 15-41.

As shown in Figure 15-42, reentrant loss pellets can be used in a fundamental 
backward wave structure to reduce small-signal gain ripple. According to Hughes, 
the buttons absorb about three quarters of the reflected power; however, they 
complicate matching but still they are widely used [11]. Another example of the 
use of loss pellets is shown for a double-slotted cavity in Figure 15-43.

Examples of termination assemblies at a sever are shown in Figure 15-44.

capability of a single wedge.

Two types of transitions are shown for the high-power coupled-cavity TWT in 
Figure 15-39. At the input, where the power level is low, a coaxial line is used to 
couple to a cavity, and at the output, a transition from the cavity to a waveguide is 
used. The use of a coaxial line and a coupling loop is common at low power 
levels. A coaxial line and coupling loop for a coupled-cavity structure are 
illustrated in Figure 15-45. 
 
At X band the small size of the input cavity (for example, 15.4 mm inside 
diameter by 3.8 mm height [12])  makes it difficult to use a coupling loop because 
the loop is so small. Because the use of  a coupling loop seemed to be very 
complicated and nonrepeatable, Wiejak used the cloverleaf antenna arrangement 
shown in Figure 15-46. The cloverleaf was attached directly to the ferrule of the 
cavity [12]. The impedance match to the input coax can be adjusted by varying the 
area and thickness of the clover leaf  and the shape of the transformer.

A cavity-to-waveguide transition for a fundamental backward wave circuit is 
shown in Figure 15-47. Several variables are available in the match cavity for 
optimizing the impedance match of the circuit to the waveguide. These include the 
ferrule height, the distance of the backwall from the ferrule, and the shape of the  
backwall. Then there is a stepped transformer to match the cavity waveguide to the 
load waveguide.  
 
A transition from waveguide to the cloverleaf circuit of a fundamental 
forward wave TWT is shown in Figure 15-48. For impedance matching, it is often 
necessary to use inductive vanes in the waveguide. These elements offset the 
capacitive reactance of the cavity gap.

Collectors 
 
 
There are, basically, two major considerations in the design of collectors for 
linear-beam tubes. These are: 
 
 
1.  Power dissipation; 
 
2.  Power recovery. 
 
When power dissipation is the dominant consideration, the collector is a single 
electrode at the voltage of the body of the tube (usually ground) and is designed to 
dissipate as heat all of the power in the spent beam (that is, the beam leaving the 
RF interaction structure of the tube). These collectors are usually used on very 
large devices in applications where power consumption is not a critical 
consideration. 
 
When power recovery is most important, the collector may have a single 
electrode or it may have two or three or more electrodes. To recover power, the 
voltages on the electrodes must be negative with respect to the body of the tube so 
that the beam is slowed down before it is collected. The energy recovered in 
slowing the beam is returned to the power supply and the heat that must be 
dissipated by the collector is greatly reduced. These collectors are used where 
overall efficiency is an important consideration. 
 
 
16.1   POWER DISSIPATION [1] 
 
In a linear-beam tube, in the absence of RF power, the entire beam energy must be 
dissipated in the collector. At first glance this does not appear to be a difficult 
problem, since, in principle, the collector may be made as large as desired. 
However, it is usually desirable to keep the collector as small as intercepted power 
densities will allow. This requires a detailed understanding of the electron 
trajectories inside the collector. 
 
In most collectors, the magnetic field is very small. The magnetic field is 
terminated in a pole piece between the end of the interaction structure and the

collector. Ideally, for all focusing schemes where the cathode is also in a field-free 
region, such as for Brillouin flow, the beam enters the collector with only an axial 
component of velocity. Thus, spreading of the beam in the collector results only 
from space-charge forces. If magnetic flux threads the cathode, then it also threads 
the collector. Then there is rotation of the beam in the collector, which is directly 
proportional to the amount of flux through the cathode. This rotation spins the 
electrons out radially and so it contributes to beam spreading in the collector. The 
effect of the magnetic field may be shown by universal beam-spread curves in the 
presence of the magnetic field threading the cathode, as shown in Figure 16-1. 
Beam spreading is increased substantially for confined-flow beams, which may 
use a focusing field of about three times the Brillouin value. For constant charge 
density in the beam, the spreading of the beam is laminar and, in principle, power 
density is known everywhere.

In the ideal case, to minimize the size of a collector, the objective is to design 
the inside shape so that the intercepted power density is constant at the maximum 
tolerable value. The shape of the resulting collector (Figure 16-2(a)) is impractical 
because it would be difficult to fabricate and because small changes in the beam 
pattern would vary power dissipation at the walls and cause overheating in some 
regions. 
 
A collector is generally designed approximately as shown in Figure 16-2(b). 
As shown in Figure 16-2(c), two critical areas of high dissipation exist: 
 

Collectors 
 
439 
 
1. Where the beam first impinges on the collector wall (dissipation is 
maximum); 
 
2. At the end of the collector. 
 
 
 The errors in the idealized analysis of trajectories inside a collector are 
mostly such that they make the beam less divergent than occurs in an actual tube. 
Causes may be:  
 
 
1. Leakage magnetic field from the focusing magnet inside the collector; 
 
2. A gradual instead of the idealized sharp cutoff of the magnetic focusing 
field at the entrance to the collector; 
 
3. The presence of positive ions which neutralize the electron space-charge 
forces.

Varian Report, September 1968.)  
 
In practice the cylindrical wall of the collector is designed according to the best 
estimate of actual beam trajectories. However, the collector is made longer than 
the calculation would indicate, and a conical end is often used to increase the 
intercepting surface area. Typically, the ratio of average to maximum (where the 
beam is first intercepted) wall dissipation will vary between 0.25 and 0.5. 
 
The maximum allowable intercepted power density is affected by:  
 
 
1. Collector wall material and thickness; 
 
2. Method of heat transfer from the wall to the cooling medium; 
 
3. Whether the intercepted power is continuous or pulsed.

Collectors for high-power tubes are usually made of copper because of its 
high thermal conductivity. If the collector wall is relatively thin, less than 1 cm, 
the temperature rise in the wall from the average beam power is less important 
than the mechanism of heat transfer to the cooling medium. For forced-flow water 
cooling with water channels of ordinary design, the average dissipation is limited 
to a working value of about 1 kW/cm2. Dissipations up to 18 kW/cm2 have been 
realized over small areas in some crossed-field devices by the use of laminated 
wall materials, very small water channels, and extremely high water pressures [2]. 
It has not been necessary to resort to these measures in linear-beam tubes. 
 
The limits of pulse heating are less well understood than average heating. 
Since pulse lengths do not usually exceed a few milliseconds, the problem is 
essentially a surface phenomenon. During a pulse, the temperature rises to a high 
value in a very thin surface layer. Two problems may arise: 
 
 
1. The surface may melt during the pulses. 
 
2. Stresses caused by the expansion and contraction of the metal during the 
repeated heating and cooling may gradually destroy the surface. 
 
 
Since a very thin boundary layer is involved, the analysis of pulse heating can 
be dealt with as a one-dimensional problem. If all intercepted beam power is 
assumed to be stored by diffusion into the collector walls, the pulse temperature 
rise as a function of peak intercepted power density, P, and pulse duration, t, is [3]:

 P t
T = 
  
K c Ï
Î
Â°
 
(16-1) 
Here K, c, and Ï are the thermal conductivity, specific heat, and specific gravity. 
This gives a somewhat larger surface temperature rise than what actually occurs, 
because electrons penetrate a small distance into the material. The penetration 
distance increases rapidly with beam voltage. An analysis of pulse heating, 
including electron penetration into the material, has been provided by 
Crapuchettes [4]. He has also derived the stresses induced in the surface of the 
material by the repeated expansion and contraction due to pulse heating. He 
concludes that the allowable temperature rise due to thermal stresses (to avoid 
surface cracking) is below 100Â°C for copper. Practice has shown that this is a 
pessimistic value and that a somewhat higher pulse temperature rise is permissible. 
 
Since cyclic thermal stresses present a more severe limitation than does 
melting of the surface, the materials other than copper for the boundary layer are 
sometimes used. For example, molybdenum has a lower coefficient of thermal 
expansion and much higher strength than copper, which more than compensates 
for its poorer thermal conductivity. As a result, molybdenum is commonly used on 
the vane tips of crossed-field devices. 
 
In high-power tubes it is important to design the tubes to reduce the possibility

of âslowâ electrons (which occur at RF saturation) and of secondary electrons 
(from the collector) striking the tube body. Therefore, the entrance to the collector 
is made as small as possible without actual interception of primary beam electrons. 
The entrance section of the collector, often of a conical shape, is sometimes 
referred to as the âfly trap.â 
 
 
16.2   POWER RECOVERY 
 
A primary consideration in selecting microwave tubes for many applications is the 
overall efficiency in converting dc input power to RF output power at the desired 
frequency. One very important part of overall efficiency is electronic efficiency, 
which is the efficiency of conversion of power in the electron beam to RF power. 
Electronic efficiency has received considerable attention since the invention of 
microwave tubes. In this section, it will be assumed that the electronic efficiency 
has been established in the design of the RF characteristics of a tube. Then, with 
electronic efficiency fixed, the enhancement of the overall efficiency with the 
collector will be discussed. 
 
16.2.1   Power Flow 
 
The various elements of power flow in a linear-beam tube are illustrated in Figure 
16-3. Power is supplied for the heater, the electron beam, and the solenoid. The RF 
input power is normally at least 30 dB below the RF output power and is assumed 
to be negligible.

Power is lost when electrons are intercepted by the circuit and by RF losses 
within the tube. In addition, some of the RF power that is generated is lost because 
it is not at the desired frequency (harmonics, intermodulation products, and so 
forth). 
 
Finally, after the RF output is removed from the tube, the beam leaving the 
RF circuit (the spent beam) contains power that is delivered to the collector. Some 
of this power is converted to heat by electrons striking the collector. If the 
collector is designed properly, the electrons can be slowed down before they strike 
the collector surfaces, and the collector can thereby recover power from the spent 
beam [5]. 
 
Using the various elements of power identified in Figure 16-3, it is 
straightforward to derive power flow and efficiency relationships. The overall tube 
efficiency, Î·ov, is simply the ratio of the RF output power to the total input power, 
Pin. That is,

Two additional efficiency terms are useful in completing the analysis. One is

The following plot of (16-12) illustrates the significances of various efficiencies 
and powers. 
 
In Figure 16-4, the effect of Pot is shown on the 90% collector efficiency plot. 
This same range of variations would apply to other Î·coll plots, but is shown for 
only the 90% plot. Similarly, the effects of variations in Pint + PRF are shown on 
the 70% Î·coll plot, but would apply to other collector efficiency plots. The effects 
of variations in circuit efficiency are shown on the 50% Î·coll plot but would apply 
to other Î·coll  plots. 
 
Perhaps the most striking aspect of Figure 16-4 is the strong dependence of 
overall efficiency on collector efficiency, especially for high values of collector 
efficiency. This leads directly to the next section, which deals with the design of 
efficient collectors. 
 
The importance of circuit efficiency is also evident in Figure 16-4. Note that a 
10% increase in Î·cir increases Î·ov about five percentage points. This leads to 
considerations of circuit efficiency, which were discussed in Chapter 14. 
 
Finally, in considering (16-12) and Figure 16-4, heater power and RF losses 
(harmonics and intermodulation products) are normally small. Thus, Pot contains 
primarily the power penalty resulting from the use of a solenoid for focusing. 
Increases in Î·ov that result from decreases in solenoid power (and Pot) can readily 
be traded off against the decrease in Î·ov that results from an increase in Pint 
(interception power), which, in turn, normally results from a decrease in solenoid 
power.

16.2.2   Power Recovery with a Depressed Collector 
 
A collector for a linear-beam tube is shown in Figure 16-5. As the beam passes 
through the pole piece, the magnetic focusing field is removed, and so space 
charge forces cause the beam to expand as it enters the collector. 
 
With the collector at the same potential as the body of the tube, electrons 
strike the collector at a relatively high velocity. Electron energy is converted to 
heat at the collector surface. With a collector like that shown in Figure 16-5, a 
relatively large percentage (normally 50% or more depending on electronic 
efficiency) of the power input to the tube is dissipated in heat in the collector. 
 
By reducing (depressing) the voltage on the collector below the body 
potential, the velocities of electrons striking the collector and the heat generated 
are reduced. As a result, the collector recovers some of the power in the spent 
electron beam. 
 
The concept of power recovery by a collector is sometimes confusing. The 
following example should help in understanding power recovery. Assume that a 
TWT with a 10-kV, 1-A electron gun produces an RF power of 2 kW as is 
indicated in Figure 16-6. Assume that, other than interception, there are no losses, 
heater power is negligible, and PPM focusing is used. With the collector at the 
same potential as the body and the helix (ground potential) as shown in Figure 
16-6(a), the overall efficiency is

All of the current intercepted by the circuit and collected by the collector returns

446 
 
In Figure 16-6(b), a second 10-kV power supply has been provided for the 
collector. The total power supplied to the tube is the same as in Figure 16-6(a) and 
so the efficiency is still 20%. However, to regulate the RF output power, only the 
cathode supply must be regulated and the power provided by that supply is now 
only 100W. The regulation requirement for the collector supply of 9,900W is 
normally far less severe than for the cathode supply. As a result, while there has 
been no improvement in efficiency in Figure 16-6(b), a substantial reduction in 
power supply complexity may have been achieved. 
 
In Figure 16-7, the voltage of the collector supply has been reduced to 
6,000V. The current provided by this supply is still the full collector current of 
0.99A; however, the power provided is only 5,940W. The RF output power is still 
2 kW and so the overall efficiency is now

(16-14) 
which is a substantial improvement over the 20% obtained in Figure 16-6. 
 
The improvement in efficiency in Figure 16-7 has been achieved by reducing 
(depressing) the voltage of the collector below the body and helix voltage and, 
thereby, slowing down the electrons before collecting them. As a result, we say 
that the collector has ârecoveredâ power from the electron beam. It should be 
noted here that the power supply engineer considers collector depression to be a 
technique for reducing power input rather than for recovering power because the 
power was not supplied to the tube in the first place. In fact, of course, both points 
of view are correct.

At the risk of belaboring this point, consider the example shown in Figure 
16-8. Here, the collector is at cathode potential and there is no RF circuit to extract 
power from the electron beam. It is also assumed that no current is intercepted by 
the anode. With 10 kV applied to the anode, a 10-kW electron beam is generated. 

Collectors 
 
447 
However, as this beam enters the collector, it is slowed down and the electron 
velocity drops to zero as the electrons land on the collector. No heat is generated in 
the collector and there are no other losses and so no power is dissipated. Thus, a 
10-kW beam has been generated by the electron gun and all of this power has been 
recovered by the collector. No power is provided by the 10-kV supply because 
there is no current flowing to it.

16.2.3   Electron Energy Distribution 
 
In Figure 16-7, the collector voltage was 6 kV, or 4 kV below the body potential. 
The collector was âdepressedâ 4 kV, and this raised the efficiency from 20% to 
33%. A logical question to ask is: Why not depress the collector further and 
improve the efficiency more? The problem is that the voltage of a depressed 
collector supply like that shown in Figure 16-7 is highly dependent on the 
distribution of electron velocities in the beam. The slower electrons will be 
reflected by the collector if the potential is depressed too far. With increasing 
collector voltage, as shown in Figure 16-9, collector current will decrease and 
body current will increase. Excessive body current will damage the RF structure. 
Also, reflected electrons traveling back through the tube induce noise in the RF 
circuit and can provide a signal feedback path to the TWT input.  
 
Single-element collectors, like that in Figure 16-7, recover roughly 30% to 
40% of the power in a spent beam (dependent on tube type). To recover a large 
fraction (over 80%) and, at the same time, prevent electrons from being reflected, 
the electric fields in a collector must be shaped so that electrons are nearly stopped 
just as they strike the collector electrodes. In addition, the fields must be shaped to 
prevent secondary electrons from being accelerated (thus wasting energy) or 
leaving the collector.

To better understand the problem of building a highly efficient collector, it is 
necessary to examine the energies of the electrons in the beam entering the 
collector. For purposes of illustration, it will be assumed that the collector power 
supply is connected as shown in Figure 16-10 and that the collector voltage can be 
varied. (Note that this is not a practical way to apply voltage to the collector 
because power is always flowing into the supply. Thus, the supply is acting like a 
battery that is continually being charged.)

In Figure 16-11, the current to the collector is plotted as a function of the 
amount by which the collector voltage is depressed, Vcoll. It is assumed that the 
body current is zero as long as the collector is not depressed too far. Also, the 
secondary electron current is ignored. When Vcoll = 0, all of the cathode current 

Collectors 
 
449 
reaches the collector and so Icoll = Io. With no RF drive, no energy is extracted 
from the beam and so all of the electrons entering the collector have the same 
energy that they had when leaving the electron gun. As a result, as the collector 
voltage is depressed, all of the electrons can reach the collector until Vcoll = Vo. As 
Vcoll becomes larger than Vo, suddenly none of the electrons can reach the collector 
and so Icoll drops to zero. 
 
When the RF drive is applied to the tube, energy in varying amounts is 
extracted from (or in some cases, added to) electrons during the interaction of the 
RF wave on the circuit with the beam. In a helix TWT, some electrons lose as 
much as 30% to 40% of their initial energy (when they left the gun) and some may 
gain as much as 30%. 
 
With the RF drive, as the collector voltage is depressed from the body 
potential, all of the cathode current reaches the collector until the collector voltage 
reaches the point where the slowest electrons can no longer reach the collector 
surface. This voltage is indicated by Vknee in Figure 16-11. As the collector voltage 
is depressed below Vknee, more and more electrons are reflected and so Icoll 
decreases. At some voltage Vmax, which is actually more negative that the cathode 
potential, Vo, the collector current drops to zero. The small âtailâ of the curve at 
voltages between Vo and Vmax is caused by those electrons that were accelerated 
rather than decelerated as the beam interacted with the RF wave.

In general, any current, such as I1 in Figure 16-11, consists of electrons with 
energy eV1 or greater. With the collector at potential V1, the maximum current that 
could be collected would be I1. The current, Io - I1, would be reflected and returned 
to the body of the tube. 
 
The shape of the curve in Figure 16-11 depends on the nature of the 
interaction between the beam and the RF circuit. For example, Figure 16-12 
contains curves for a helix TWT and for a high-efficiency klystron. (More will be

said later about the reasons for normalizing the current and voltage to the cathode 
values.) For the klystron, the interaction is so intense that some electrons lose 
nearly all of their energy while others have their energy nearly doubled so a 
collector that was depressed even a small amount would reflect some current.

power is lost to the VmaxâVo tail and there are RF losses, so the RF power out of the

In Figure 16-13, the area under the solid curve is the power remaining in the 
spent beam. This is the maximum power that could possibly be recovered by an 
ideal collector. To recover part of that power, the power supply configuration must 
be as shown in Figure 16-14 (and as was shown in Figure 16-7). The collector 
supply voltage, Vc, is the cathode voltage, Vo, less the amount by which the 
collector voltage is depressed, Vcoll. The maximum power that could be recovered 
by a single-electrode collector is shown by the shaded area in Figure 16-15. (The 
collector with a single electrode is often referred to as a single-stage collector. 
Collectors with several electrodes, to be discussed in following paragraphs, are 
called multistage collectors.)

When Vc is smaller than what is shown in Figure 16-15, electrons are reflected 
by the collector because the amount by which the collector is depressed, Vcoll, is 
greater than the knee voltage. When Vc is greater than what is shown in Figure 
16-15, all electrons are collected. In practice, it is not possible to operate a single-
stage collector as close to the knee of the curve as is indicated in Figure 16-15. 
One reason is that Vc is not normally highly regulated and so Vc must be high 
enough to avoid electron reflections under all operating conditions. Another reason 
is that the knee of the curve is normally not as sharply defined as is shown in 
Figures 16-11, 16-13, and 16-15 and so excessive electron reflection (and body 
current) occurs with collector voltages well above that indicated in Figure 16-15. 
 
16.2.5   Effect of Body Current [6] 
 
The effect of body current on the energy distribution curves is shown in Figure 
16-16. Here, currents and voltages have been normalized with respect to the 
cathode values. This normalization is often used because body current and 
collector currents are often expressed as percentages of the cathode values.

The three plots given in Figure 16-16 show how increases in body current 
affect the energy distribution curves as the RF drive is increased from zero (dc 
beam) to a low level (low basic efficiency) and then to a high level (high basic 
efficiency). Body current reduces the areas under the curves, and this reduces the 
power available for recovery by a collector.

16.2.6   Multistage Depressed Collectors 
 
The preceding discussion provides the basis for the design of efficient collectors. 
Highly efficient collectors use several electrodes at different potentials to 
selectively collect electrons at low energies. These collectors are multistage 
depressed collectors (MDCs). 
 
In the previous section, energy distribution curves were shown for the electron 
beam entering the collector. It was pointed out that the area under a curve 
represents the power available in the spent beam for recovery by the collector. To 
recover a large fraction of this power, the collector must be designed to sort the 
electrons in the spent beam into various energy classes. Then electrons in each 
energy class must be collected on an electrode at a voltage that recovers as much 
of that energy as possible. Figure 16-17 illustrates the recovery of a substantial 
amount of spent beam power by a four-stage collector. Here, as in previous 
discussions, the effects of secondary electrons are not yet being considered.

The research and development for the collectors that operate as indicated in 
Figure 16-17 was led by NASA. The original impetus for the work was the high 
premium on efficiency that resulted from the high cost of power generation and 
heat reflection on satellites. Now the NASA collector technology is used in a 
broad range of applications where high microwave power is required and prime 
power is limited. An example is airborne electronic countermeasures systems [7].

The collector-electrode configurations for the NASA MDCs are illustrated in 
Figures 16-18 and 16-19. The first NASA collectors were derived from 
mathematical solutions to the problem of both slowing down and dispersing the 
electron beam entering the collector. As shown in Figure 16-18, the equipotential 
surfaces were designed to be concave toward the aperture where the beam entered 
the collector. This forced electrons to move radially outward. Collector electrodes 
were designed to coincide with the equipotential surfaces that were derived 
mathematically. The aperture sizes in the electrodes were chosen so that electrons 
would land on electrodes at the appropriate voltage. Since most beam electrons 
landed on the back sides of the electrodes, secondary electrons were emitted into a 
negative potential region and, therefore, were immediately returned to the 
electrode surfaces.

In all microwave tubes, some electrons are out of phase with the RF voltage 
and are accelerated, rather than decelerated, by the interaction process. These 
electrons leave the interaction region with energies greater than the original beam 
energy. In the NASA collector in Figure 16-18, the sharp spike at the back of the 
collector helps shape the fields to disperse high energy electrons. In addition, the 
surface area presented to high energy electrons is minimized. Thus, the generation 
of reflected electrons is minimized. The efficiencies of collectors patterned after 
the design in Figure 16-18 are very high (> 85%) and the current reflected from 
the collector is very small. Complexity and size are disadvantages.

collector. (From: J. A. Dayton, Jr., AIAA 12th International Communication Satellite 
Systems Conference.) 
 
 
Collectors of the type shown in Figure 16-19 were originally developed 
during a joint NASA/USAF program. Collector size was reduced significantly 
with a small compromise in efficiency so that MDCs could be used in airborne 
applications, where size and weight are important considerations. In these 
collectors, called individual lens collectors, each electrode and its associated fields 
were optimized to produce maximum collector efficiency while minimizing the 
current resulting from reflected electrons. 
 
For an MDC to operate efficiently, the electron beam entering it must not 
diverge rapidly. Rapid divergence leads to large radial components of electron 
velocities and to energy components that cannot be recovered by the collector. 
 
To reduce the divergence of a beam, it is sometimes necessary to expand its 
diameter so that space charge forces are reduced. A magnetic refocusing system, 
one version of which is shown in Figure 16-20, is used for this purpose. An 
additional benefit of the refocusing system is an improvement in the laminarity of 
the beam entering the collector. 
 
Improvements in overall efficiency that have been demonstrated by using an 
MDC on a dual-mode helix TWT for electronic countermeasures applications are 
shown in Figure 16-21. An overall efficiency improvement by a factor of three or 
more was demonstrated across a bandwidth of an octave. The collector efficiency 
was nearly constant at about 85%, as shown in Figure 16-22.

A very important application for MDCs is in tubes, such as satellite tubes, 
where efficient operation is necessary when operating well below saturation. As 
shown in Figure 16-23, the efficiency of the MDC increases significantly as the 
input signal level is reduced. For the example in Figure 16-23, the MDC efficiency 
exceeds 97% when the drive signal level (and basic efficiency) are reduced to 
zero.

At a drive level low enough so that the basic (electronic) efficiency and the 
overall efficiency (without MDC) is 1%, use of an MDC increases the overall 
efficiency to 14%. At a basic efficiency of 4%, the MDC increases the efficiency 
to 30%. Thus, using a MDC, efficient operation over a wide range of drive levels 
is possible. 
 
A power supply configuration for a MDC is shown in Figure 16-24. As was

the case for the single-element depressed collector, the cathode-to-anode (and 
helix) supply must be regulated, but it must supply only the power resulting from 
the interception current. The tapped power supply for the collector is essentially an 
unregulated supply. This is because variations in voltages to collector elements 
may cause some electrons to move from one collector element to another, but the 
overall effect on efficiency is negligible.

In Figure 16-18, the number of stages in the MDC was 10 and, in Figure 
16-19, it was four. The optimum number is determined by considering the increase 
in tube efficiency that can be achieved with a large number of electrodes and 
trading this off against the increased complexity of the power supply and of tube 
construction. 
 
As Figure 16-25 shows, the increase in efficiency achieved with more than 
about three or four stages is small and Thus, for most applications, no more than 
three or four stages are used. The efficiencies in Figure 16-25 were computed and 
are based on a knowledge of the spent beam characteristics of each type of tube. 
 
16.2.7   Secondary Electrons in Depressed Collectors 
 
Excessive secondary electron emission in depressed collectors can cause two 
problems: 
 
 
1. Escape of secondaries from the collector, which may cause excessive 
noise, signal distortions, and heating of the circuit;

2. Current flow between collector electrodes and excessive heating of 
electrodes, which, in turn, results in the reduction of collector efficiency. 
 
 
The first of these problems is discussed in Chapters 23 and 24. The second 
problem arises when secondary electrons released from the front surface of a 
collector electrode are collected by a more positive electrode. An example was 
shown in Figure 16-19 where trajectories for five secondary electrons released 
from electrode #4 are plotted. Three of these electrons strike electrode #3 after 
being accelerated through 1.6 kV (9.3â7.7 kV). The other two strike electrode #2 
after being accelerated through 3.6 kV. 
 
The effect of secondary electrons on efficiency is shown in Figure 16-26 [8]. 
Tests were performed with a four-stage MDC having various electrode surface 
treatments. Using electrodes with textured isotropic graphite surfaces rather than 
untreated copper, collector efficiency increased about 10%. The overall efficiency 
increased over 5%. 
 
The technique of texturing materials for collector surfaces has been developed 
by the NASA Lewis Research Center [9]. The texturing is accomplished by 
bombarding the surface with argon ions. For the textured graphite surfaces 
described in [9], the ion accelerating potential was 1,000â1,500V dc, the surface 
current density of the sample was 3â5 mA/cm2, and the texturing period was 1â4 
hours. A scanning electron microscope photomicrograph of a fully developed 
textured carbon surface on a copper substrate is shown in Figure 16-27. The 
surface appearance in this figure is also typical of fully developed ion-textured 
pyrolytic and high purity isotropic graphite. The larger spires have average heights 
of 6â12 Î¼m and average spacings of 3â6 Î¼m.

The secondary emission characteristics of textured carbon on a copper 
substrate are shown in Figure 16-28. The true secondary emission coefficient for 
normal incidence of the primary beam is from 0.2 to about 0.25. This is 
significantly below the value for soot, which has, in the past, been the lowest yield 
surface available. Soot has not been used in microwave tubes because of its poor 
physical characteristics. The reflected primary yield index, Ï, for normal incidence 
ranges from about 0.5 to about 1.5. The basis for this index is the primary yield for 
soot with a primary electron energy of 1 keV and normal incidence. For these 
conditions, the value of Ï is unity.

In addition to texturing various carbon surfaces, NASA has developed 
techniques for texturing copper [10]. With one technique, sputtered molybdenum 
is used as a texture-inducing masking film. The true secondary electron emission 
ratios for these surfaces range from 0.3 to 0.5 and are a factor of 3 below ratios for 
untreated copper surfaces. The reflected primary yield index is a factor of about 3 
to 7 below that for an untreated copper surface. The results reported in [10] were 
for three samples of ion textured copper. One conclusion of the NASA work is 
âwith further development, the molybdenum-masked, ion-textured OFHC copper 
surface will be a promising material for high efficiency MDC electrodes.â

16.3   COLLECTOR COOLING [1] 
 
16.3.1   Conduction Cooling 
 
Heat transfer by conduction to a heat sink is the simplest form of cooling where 
the power level of the tube is low enough to permit it. Little maintenance is 
normally required. However, it is necessary to make sure that tubes are tightly 
bolted to the heat sink and that no gaps exist between surfaces. 
 
16.3.2   Convection Cooling 
 
Devices that generate up to a few watts of average power may require no cooling 
other than natural air convection. To take the best advantage of this type of 
cooling, the surface exposed to the air is often many times larger than the actual 
inside area of the collector. About 1 watt/cm2 of surface exposed to open air can be 
handled by this approach. 
 
16.3.3   Forced-Air Cooling 
 
Although forced-air cooling is capable of dissipating power densities nearly as 
high as water cooling can, its use is limited because of practical considerations. A 
typical air-cooled collector, which has been used to dissipate a power density of 
200 watts/cm2, is shown in Figure 16-29. The cooling fins are brazed to the body 
of the collector to provide a large area multiplication factor (larger than 10) from 
the power-intercepting area to the air-exposed surface. One of the limitations of air 
cooling is blower power. To minimize the input to the air pump, it is necessary to 
have a large number of short air passages in parallel. An optimum cooling fin 
arrangement, shown in Figure 16-29, requires a blower power of from 5 to 10% of 
the average collector power. This is a much higher level than for water cooling. 
Another limitation of air cooling is that it is not easily applicable to other portions 
of the tube such as the interaction structure. Because of these disadvantages, 
forced-air cooling is generally used only for tubes up to the few kilowatts level. At 
higher-power levels the circulating water system is preferred. 
 
16.3.4   Forced-Flow Liquid Cooling 
 
This is by far the most often used method for cooling collectors for medium- and 
high-power tubes. An effective method is simply to place a water jacket around the 
collector and remove heat by conduction from the collector body to the water. The 
amount of heat that can be transferred to the water is directly proportional to the 
wetted surface area and the heat transfer coefficient. Both are optimized when 
many narrow channels with large perimeters, but small cross-sectional areas are 
used together with high velocity flow.

To avoid excessively high temperature rises in the collector walls, water 
channels must be located near the intercepting surface. As a result, the wetted 
surface area is generally limited to a factor of about three or four times the interior 
collector area. Higher factors could be achieved, but this requires machining of 
channels of a more complicated cross-section than is convenient with ordinary 
techniques. Some collector wall sections showing water channel shapes are shown 
in Figure 16-30.

The heat transfer coefficient used is usually computed on the basis of allowing 
no boiling of water at the surface. The heat transfer coefficient will 
characteristically be on the order of 1 cal/cm2/sec/Â°C temperature rise in the 
surface film of water. Much higher heat transfer coefficients can be achieved if the 
water is allowed to boil, as is frequently the case with high-power collectors. Care

must be taken to insure that operation occurs in the nucleate boiling region, which 
has a high heat transfer capability and does not enter into the film boiling region, 
for which the surface temperature must be very high and might cause melting of 
the collector material. 
 
It is customary to design water cooling to be operable at pressure drops of less 
than 100 lb/in2 and flow rates commensurate with average temperature rises from 
30Â°C to 50Â°C. If a specific design has been made for water, cooling will generally 
suffer when other fluids are used because of differences in thermal conductivity, 
heat capacity, viscosity, and other characteristics. Ethylene glycol is used for low-
temperature applications, principally to avoid the problem of freezing during 
storage. It is inferior to water as a coolant. Other fluids have been considered but 
are seldom used in practice, even though some have advantages with respect to 
water. Cost and availability are the most frequent deterrents to the use of most of 
the special fluids. 
 
16.3.5   Vapor Phase Cooling 
 
This method takes advantage of the latent heat of evaporation of water by allowing 
the water to boil at the collector surface. The steam is then condensed in a heat 
exchanger and returned to the collector, forming a closed system. To achieve 
reasonable dissipation densities, operation must be either in or near the transition 
between film boiling and nucleate boiling. Since this would ordinarily represent a 
runaway region, it can be used only when boiling equilibrium is maintained. 
 
Beurtheret [11] pioneered this type of cooling for vacuum tubes in the 
âVapotronâ-type collectors. To understand this, the curve shown in Figure 16-31 is 
helpful. Heat transfer increases very rapidly with the surface temperature until the 
discontinuous region is reached where heat transfer actually drops as nucleate 
boiling changes into film boiling. At this point the surface temperature will 
undergo a temperature increase of about 1,000Â°C for the same heat flux, which is 
prohibitive because of burnout. 
 
The vapor-phase-cooled collector (a section is shown in Figure 16-32) has an 
array of protruding bars, which, during operation, develop a thermal gradient along 
them such that the outer end does not boil at all. The base of the protrusions is 
always low in the film boiling region, and all other regions of boiling exist 
continuously between the two extremes. Maximum heat transfer occurs near the 
middle of the bar. Any small change of heat transfer in the system will shift the 
point of maximum heat transfer along the bar, thus readily absorbing the 
fluctuation without a discontinuous jump in the temperature. The detailed shape of 
the collector protrusion is crucial in the functioning of the system. 
 
Vapor-phase-cooled collectors are used in high-power tubes where dissipation 
densities are on the order of 1 to 200 watts/cm2 and where it is preferable to avoid 
a forced-flow system with water pumps. Examples are CW klystrons designed for 
UHF television transmitters in the 30- to 50-kW range.

16.3.6   Radiation Cooling 
 
One approach to radiation cooling is to allow the collector to run at a high enough 
temperature so that heat is lost by radiation directly into space. This approach, 
though attractive because of its simplicity, poses certain problems. The collector 
temperature must be in the neighborhood of 1,000Â°C to provide a reasonable 
dissipation capability. In order to minimize temperature rise on the inside as well

as to suppress lateral flow of heat to the tube body, a thin membrane-type collector 
is necessary. This raises problems with mechanical strength as well as gas 
diffusion through the collector. The latter, at least in principle, may be avoided if 
the tube is intended for use in a space environment. However, some tube testing at 
atmospheric pressure is always necessary. Thus, it is preferable to enclose the 
collector in a vacuum envelope essentially transparent to radiated heat. Some of 
the possible collector materials are the refractory metals, such as tungsten, 
molybdenum, and tantalum. 
 
Black-body radiation at 1,000Â°C is approximately 12 watts/cm2. A reasonable 
value of emissivity with proper carbonization might be 80%, reducing the above 
value to about 10 watts/cm2. So it appears that, because radiated power varies as 
the fourth power of temperature, operation between 1,000Â°C and 2,000Â°C might 
yield cooling capabilities on the order of 100 watts/cm2. One of the largest 
problems is back radiation to the tube, which dictates the use of a fairly large 
collector with a small beam entrance aperture. Also, problems may arise from 
collector evaporation and deposition inside the tube as well as on the radiation 
window. 
 
A radiation-cooled collector used by Lien et al. [12] in a lightweight space 
communications tube is shown schematically in Figure 16-33. A reflector is used 
inside as well as outside the vacuum envelope to protect the tube from back 
radiation. A sapphire radiation window was chosen because of its high 
transparency to infrared. This collector was operated at a power level of about 300 
watts at a temperature of 1,500Â°C. The collector material was tungsten. The 
measured radiation-cooling efficiency was approximately 75%, indicating that 
25% of the beam power striking the collector was returned to the tube body. 
Although this was far from being an optimized device, the latter percentage is 
indicative of some of the problems with this type of cooling. It appears that 
radiation cooling will only find application in a narrow range of special-purpose 
tubes where considerations of system weight are paramount.

Crossed-Field Tubes 
 
 
In crossed-field tubes, the dc electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic field as 
is indicated in Figure 17-1(a). The general motion of the electron beam is 
perpendicular to both fields. This is in contrast to linear-beam tubes (such as 
klystrons and TWTs, Figure 17-1(b)) where the general direction of beam motion 
is aligned with the fields. Crossed-field tubes are referred to as âM-typeâ tubes 
after the French TPOM, which in English means tubes for propagation of waves in 
a magnetic field.

17.1   BASIC CONFIGURATION OF CROSSED-FIELD TUBES 
 
The basic configuration of a magnetron and of a crossed-field amplifier (CFA) is 
shown in Figure 17-3. Magnetrons are oscillators and CFAs are amplifiers. The 
CFA is derived from the magnetron and, in fact, the original CFA invented by 
Brown [1] was a magnetron that had been modified so that it could amplify a 
signal.

The magnetron in Figure 17-3 has eight cavities. As shown in Figure 17-4, the 
equivalent circuit for one of the cavities is a parallel resonant LC circuit. The hole 
of the cavity is the inductive portion and the slot is the capacitive portion. In an 

Crossed-Field Tubes

eight-cavity magnetron, the equivalent circuit has eight of these parallel resonant 
circuits in series.  
 
When a magnetron is first turned on, the only signal that is present is the noise 
(random fluctuations in electron velocity and density) in the electron cloud circling 
about the cathode. However, the noise consists of signals of all frequencies 
including the frequency at which the cavities resonate. The oscillations in a 
magnetron build up very rapidly (in nanoseconds) by amplification of the noise 
signal of the correct frequency.

The RF (slow wave) circuit in a CFA can have the configuration of any one of 
many circuits. These can be either forward wave or backward wave circuits. These 
circuits are sometimes modeled as LC transmission lines, in contrast to the LC 
parallel circuits of magnetrons. The CFA circuit shown in Figure 17-4 is a forward 
wave circuit similar to the helix in a TWT and consists of two helices supported by 
copper vanes. In addition to providing support for the helices, the vanes carry heat 
away from the helices. 
 
 
17.2   ELECTRON FLOW WITH NO RF FIELDS 
 
The crossed-field devices considered in this book are all cylindrical. In nearly all 
cases, the cathode is a cylinder, which is concentric with the anode. If there is no 
RF circuit on the anode, the configuration of the device is that of the smooth bore 
magnetron in Figure 17-5. 
 
In the absence of RF fields, and ignoring space charge forces, electron 
trajectories can readily be found. Since the electrodes are concentric, the electric 
field is radial with no Î¸ variations. The magnetic field, which is perpendicular to 
the electric field, is axial. The force components are:

As electrons leave the cathode and move toward the anode, they are deflected in

Thus, the voltage that causes the electron to just graze the anode depends on the 
dimensions ra and rc and on the flux density (in Ïc) but not on the way in which 
the voltage varies between the cathode and anode. The electron trajectory is shown 
in Figure 17-6(a). The anode voltage at which this occurs is called the Hull cutoff 
voltage and is denoted here by VH. When Va > VH, the electron strikes the anode as 
indicated in Figure 17-6(b). When Va < VH, the electron returns to the cathode 
(Figure 17-6(c)).

If the anode voltage is held constant at VH, then, as the magnetic field is 
decreased, current flows to the anode and as the magnetic field is increased, no 
current flows. Thus, it is the critical combination of electric and magnetic fields 
known as the Hull cutoff condition and shown in Figure 17-7 at which electrons 
just touch the anode. 
 
Before leaving the subject of the Hull cutoff condition, it is interesting to 
examine the current-voltage characteristic of the ideal smooth bore magnetron. As 
shown in Figure 17-8, when the anode voltage is small (< VH), no current flows to 
the anode. As the anode voltage is increased and reaches the Hull cutoff value, the 
current increases from zero to the full amount that is available. As the anode 
voltage increases beyond the Hull cutoff value, all of the available current 
continues to flow. Thus, when the smooth bore magnetron is conducting, it is a 
constant current device. In fact, in real magnetrons and crossed-field amplifiers, 
while current is not constant, it does vary relatively slowly as voltage is varied.

The first magnetrons that were described in the literature were the cyclotron 
resonance magnetron and the negative resistance magnetron. These operated very 
close to the Hull cutoff condition but were very inefficient. Their operation is 
described in Chapter 19. On the other hand, traveling wave magnetrons and CFAs, 
which are described in Chapters 19 and 20, are very efficient and operate at 
voltages and magnetic fields that are well below the Hull cutoff parabola. If there 
was no RF interaction, no current would flow in the devices. However, with RF, 
current does flow and the high efficiency of the devices is related to the energy 
that the electrons acquire and then give up as they move from the cathode to the 
anode.

Cathodes for Crossed-Field Tubes 
 
 
In crossed-field tubes, electrons are emitted from the cathode by secondary 
electron emission, which may be combined with thermionic emission. The 
thermionic emission process was discussed in detail in Chapter 5. In this chapter, 
the secondary emission process and its role in the operation of crossed-field 
devices are discussed. 
 
 
18.1   INTRODUCTION 
 
As shown in Figure 18-1, when electrons bombard a surface, they may cause other 
electrons to be emitted from that surface. The bombarding electrons are called 
primary electrons and the emitted electrons are called secondary electrons. 
Secondary emission is of extreme importance in the operation of cathodes of 
crossed-field tubes where the electric and magnetic field configurations cause 
primary electrons to bombard the cathode. The way in which this occurs is 
indicated in Figure 18-2, which shows the RF field distribution in a magnetron. 
The path of an electron emitted at point A on the cathode is shown. After emission 
from the cathode, the electron is accelerated toward the anode, which, in crossed-
field devices, contains an RF circuit (eight resonant cavities in Figure 18-2). 
Because a magnetic field is present (the direction is into paper), the electron 
moves in a curved path in the clockwise direction. The direction of the RF field is 
such that it accelerates this particular electron and drives it back into the cathode 
surface. If the energy with which the electron strikes the cathode surface is high 
enough, then it can cause as many as several secondary electrons to be emitted. 
 
Often, all or at least a major portion of the electrons from the cathode of a 
crossed-field device are emitted by secondary emission and the remainder are 
thermionically emitted. An example is the Philips YJ 1183 spin-tuned magnetron 
in which it is estimated that thermionic emission produces 3 A/cm2 and secondary 
emission produces 23 A/cm2 for a total cathode emission of 26 A/cm2.

18.2   CHARACTERISTICS OF SECONDARY EMISSION 
 
In the secondary emission process, when a primary electron strikes a solid, it gives 
up energy by repelling electrons in the solid. The electrons in the solid gain energy 
and may or may not be emitted, depending on how much energy they receive, how 
close they are to the surface, and the direction of their motion. The number of 
secondary electrons emitted for each primary electron is called the secondary 
emission coefficient and is usually denoted by Î´ or Ï. We will use Î´. The value of 
Î´ depends on several quantities: 
 

Cathodes for Crossed-Field Tubes

1. Energy of the impacting primary electrons; 
 
2. Angle with which the primary electrons strike the surface; 
 
3. Secondary emitting properties of the surface. 
 
18.2.1   Energy of Impacting Primary Electrons 
 
The typical variation of Î´ with primary electron energy is shown in Figure 18-3. 
At very low energy levels, Î´ approaches zero. As primary electron energy is 
increased, Î´ increases, crosses unity, and reaches a maximum. Then, as primary 
electron energy is increased beyond this point, Î´ decreases and becomes less than 
unity again. The reason for this decrease in Î´ is that the primary electrons penetrate 
so deeply into the surface that their energy is dissipated in electrons that cannot 
reach the surface.

There are four quantities associated with the secondary emission property of a 
surface that are usually of significance. These are: 
 
 
1. First crossover energy, EI (53V in Figure 18-3); 
 
2. Maximum secondary emission coefficient, Î´max (2.0 in Figure 18-3); 
 
3. Primary electron energy, Emax, at which Î´max occurs (350V in Figure 
18-3); 
 
4.  Second crossover energy, EII (1,710V in Figure 18-3).

The first crossover energy, EI, is the lowest primary electron energy that produces 
a Î´ of unity. The maximum secondary emission coefficient, Î´max, is a convenient 
way of characterizing the secondary emissivity of a surface. The second crossover 
energy, EII, is the highest electron energy that produces a Î´ of unity.  
 
18.2.2   Angle of Incidence of Primary Electrons 
 
The angle of incidence, Î¸, of the primary electrons has a strong effect on the 
secondary emission coefficient of a surface. This dependency is shown in Figures 
18-4 and 18-5 for molybdenum [1]. Note that Î´max increases from <1.4 to about 1.9 
or about 40% as Î¸ increases from 0Â° to 60Â°. The reason for the increase in Î´ with Î¸ 
is that, as Î¸ increases, primary electrons remain closer to the surface and so they 
give up their energy to electrons closer to the surface of the secondary emitter. As 
a result, there is a greater probability that the excited electrons will be emitted 
from the surface. 
 
It is interesting that the first crossover energy of about 100 eV is nearly 
independent of Î¸. Also, it is clear, although it is not shown in Figure 18-4, that the 
second crossover energy increases significantly as Î¸ increases.

18.2.3   Secondary Emitting Properties of Surfaces 
 
The secondary emitting properties of surfaces vary widely from material to 
material and are critically dependent on the conditions of the surface. Examples 
are shown in Figures 18-6 through 18-10. In each case, Î´ is shown for an incidence 
angle of 0Â°. A material with an extremely low Î´ (Î´max â 0.25) is shown in Figure 
18-6. This material is textured carbon on a copper surface and was developed by 
NASA for possible use in multistage depressed collectors where it is important to 
inhibit secondary electron emission.

In Figure 18-7, the extremely high Î´ (Î´max > 20) of a diamond film on a 
molybdenum substrate is shown. When this film was subjected to ion 
bombardment so that the surface was converted to carbon, the value of Î´max 
dropped to about unity. Diamond films have been considered for use in the 
cathodes of crossed-field amplifiers, but the degrading effects of ion and electron 
bombardment make their use questionable.

In Figure 18-8, the secondary emission characteristics of tungsten are shown 
[private communication from A. Dallos et al., Raytheon]. The value of Î´max is 
about 1.4. The presence of oxygen on the surface of the tungsten increases Î´max to 
about 2.3. This clearly illustrates the necessity for careful surface preparation if the 
true secondary emission coefficient of the surface is to be determined. 
 
Beryllium oxide (BeO) is frequently used as a cathode material in crossed-
field amplifiers. The secondary emission coefficient for this material depends on 
the nature of the BeO surface and the way in which it was formed. For grit-blasted 
beryllium oxidized by exposure to air for several days, Î´ is shown in Figure 18-9 
[2]. The value of Î´max is about 2.8 (1% of the surface was covered by carbon). A 
small quantity of carbon on the surface (1/4 of a monolayer) reduces Î´max to 
somewhat over 2. Since proper operation of a CFA depends on the value of Î´max, it 
is obvious that the presence of carbon (or other materials) that contaminate the 
cathode surface can degrade tube operation.

Figure 18-9 also shows that the first crossover energy, EI, increases rapidly 
with carbon contamination. This is important in the operation of CFAs that use 
cold cathodes because there is no thermionic emission and tube operation depends 
entirely on secondary emission. Electron emission is initiated by the interaction of 
the RF input signal with stray electrons. EI is important because, the lower EI is, 
the lower the RF input signal level has to be to start the tube properly. Figure 
18-10 shows the dependence of Î´max and EI on carbon. It was noted by Ritz et al. 
that a 0.03 difference in carbon atomic fraction will change Î´max by 0.1 and shift EI 
by 7 volts. Again, this illustrates the strong dependency on carbon of the 
secondary emitting properties of a cathode most important to CFA operation.

18.2.4   Energy Distribution of Secondary Electrons 
 
The energy distribution of secondary electrons is shown in Figure 18-11. The 
majority of the electrons are emitted with energies of a few tens of electron volts. 
These are the electrons in the solid that acquire energy as the result of collisions 
with the primary electrons. A second peak in the secondary emission plot occurs at 
energy levels that are near the primary electron energy (near 100%). The electrons 
in this peak are those that experience elastic collisions at the solid surface and are 
reflected from that surface with an energy that is at or near the primary electron 
energy.

Perhaps the most significant aspect of the secondary electron energy 
distribution is the high values of electron energies (compared with thermionically 
emitted electrons). Thermionic electrons have energies of a small fraction of an 
electron volt. Secondary electrons have energies two orders of magnitude higher. 
This is part of the cause of the high noise output of crossed-field devices. 
 
18.2.5   Modeling of Secondary Emission Characteristics 
 
Vaughan developed simple empirical formulas that appear to describe quite 
accurately the variations of secondary emission coefficient with primary electron 
energy and with angle of incidence [3, 4]. These formulas are of value in computer 
codes used to model the operation of crossed-field tubes. The first step in using the 
formulas is to calculate Emax(Î¸) and Î´max (Î¸) as functions of the impact angle, Î¸, 
from those quantities when Î¸ = 0. The equations for this calculation are:

where ksE and ksÎ´ are factors, the values of which depend on the smoothness of the 
surface being considered. They should each be assigned a default value of 1.0, 
which, Vaughan said, is appropriate for typical dull surfaces in a working tube 
environment. Lower values would be appropriate for deliberately roughened 
surfaces, down to zero for textured carbon. Higher values up to about 2.0 will be 
appropriate for exceptionally smooth, clean, oxide-free surfaces.

The quantity Eo is the minimum impact energy at which any secondary electrons at 
all are generated and is taken as 12.5 eV. 
 
Shih and Hor [1] showed that Vaughanâs formulas agree extremely well with 
their experimental results for molybdenum. Careful measurements similar to those 
of Shih and Hor are needed for other materials to provide a more stringent test of 
Vaughanâs formulas. 
 
 
18.3   OPERATION OF CATHODES IN CROSSED-FIELD DEVICES 
 
Some crossed-field devices use hot cathodes and others use cold cathodes. The 
cold cathode devices are crossed-field amplifiers. Cathode emission is initiated by 
the interaction of the RF input signal with a few stray electrons (at least 10 âgoodâ 
electrons according to one CFA engineer). The source of these stray electrons is 
not clear. Field emission and multipactor are both possible sources. The RF input 
signal drives these electrons into the cathode surface, causing secondary emission. 
If the secondary emission coefficient of the cathode is high enough, then emission 
current quickly (in nanoseconds) builds up to the operating current level. 
 
In either hot-cathode or cold-cathode devices, the environment for the cathode 
is extremely harsh and many degradation mechanisms exist. First of all, as shown 
in Figure 18-12(a), there is intense electron bombardment of the surface. This 
causes heating and, if the temperature is not properly controlled, excessive 
evaporation of cathode constituents. In addition, electron bombardment leads to 
dissociation of emissive materials, such as barium oxide, on the surface of the 
cathode. The only cathodes free from the deleterious effects of electron 
bombardment are those fabricated from pure metal or from carburized thoriated 
tungsten. Electron bombardment also decomposes carbon monoxide and leaves a 
deposit of carbon on the cathode surface. 
 
When arcs occur in crossed-field tubes, arc products are deposited on the 
cathode surface as is indicated in Figure 18-12(b). The arc products contaminate 
and reduce the secondary emission capability of the cathode. As a result, the noise 
figure and jitter of the tube increase. There must be some built-in mechanism in 
the tube to restore emission. In some tubes, it is the residual gas that provides ions 
during tube operation that clean the cathode surface. In tubes with BeO cathodes, 
an atmosphere of oxygen at a pressure of about 10â6 torr is used to maintain the 
oxidized surface of the cathode. This oxygen also becomes ionized and the 
positive ions bombard and clean the cathode surface. Also, the oxygen serves to 
oxidize carbon on the cathode surface and this goes off as CO or CO2. In some 
tubes with platinum cathodes, the anode vane tips are also coated with platinum. 
This material is eroded from the anode during tube operation and is deposited on 
the cathode so that the platinum surface is maintained.

Ions serve to clean the cathode surface, but they also sputter emissive material 
from the surface as indicated in Figure 18-12(c). Not only does this degrade 
emission, but also it results in the deposition of material on the anode. The 
secondary emission coefficient of that material is high so multipactor discharges 
may occur between elements of the RF circuit on the anode. 
 
Another degradation mechanism indicated in Figure 18-12(c) is the erosion of 
the anode and this can be produced by decomposition products from the cathode. 
For example, Vaughan reported magnetron anode erosion in the presence of 
cathodes containing oxides [5]. He cited an example in which a thoria-
molybdenum cathode was replaced by a tungsten-thorium cathode and this 
completely eliminated a severe anode erosion problem. It was not clear whether it 
was O or CO that was causing the erosion.

Magnetrons 
 
 
In magnetrons [1â7], the anode and cathode are cylindrical and concentric. They 
operate in a magnetic field that is perpendicular to the electric field between the 
cathode and anode. The magnetic field causes electrons from the cathode to move 
in curved paths. Electron motion in crossed dc fields was discussed in Chapters 4 
and 17. 
 
In addition to the dc field effects, RF electric fields and space-charge forces 
combine to alter the trajectories indicated in Chapters 4 and 17. The RF circuit and 
field patterns along with operating characteristics for magnetrons are described in 
the following sections. 
 
 
19.1   TYPES OF MAGNETRONS 
 
There are three basic types of magnetrons: 
 
 
1.  Cyclotron-frequency magnetrons; 
 
2.  Negative-resistance magnetrons; 
 
3.  Traveling wave magnetrons. 
 
Cyclotron-frequency and negative-resistance magnetrons are no longer used. 
However, their basic principles of operation will be described to help form a 
foundation for the understanding of traveling wave magnetrons, which are now in 
use. 
 
19.1.1   Cyclotron-Frequency Magnetrons 
 
The first crossed-field tube, shown in Figure 19-1, was the cyclotron-frequency 
magnetron invented by A. W. Hull and reported in 1921 [8]. This and other early 
magnetrons used cylindrical anodes with no RF structure. Efficiencies and power 
capabilities were very low.

Figure 19-1   Electron trajectories in a cyclotron frequency magnetron. 
 
 
Cyclotron-frequency magnetrons made use of interaction between orbiting 
electrons in a magnetic field and a resonant circuit tuned to the cyclotron 
frequency. In the simplest form of these magnetrons, the cathode and anode were 
coaxial cylinders and were operated in a magnetic field parallel to the electrode 
axis. The resonant circuit was a quarter-wavelength parallel-line resonator 
connected between the cathode and anode as indicated in Figure 19-1. 
 
To produce oscillations, the voltage and magnetic field were adjusted close to 
the cutoff condition so that electron trajectories were like that for the dc-field case. 
Electrons emitted when the RF electric field aided the dc electric field landed on 
the anode, and so these, which extracted energy from the RF field, were removed 
from interaction. Electrons emitted when the RF field opposed the dc field gave up 
energy to the RF field and missed the anode. If the frequency of rotation of the 
electrons (cyclotron frequency) was close to the RF frequency, then electrons that 
initially gave up energy (in Region 1) arrived in Region 2 as the field reversed and 
again gave up energy to the field. So these electrons contributed energy to the RF 
oscillation. The process continued as long as the phase relationship with the field 
persisted or until the electrons were removed from interaction. Cyclotron 
frequency magnetrons operated at frequencies up to the millimeter-wave range, 
but had very low power output and efficiency. 
 
 19.1.2   Negative-Resistance Magnetrons 
 
Negative-resistance magnetrons were split-anode devices as shown in Figure 19-2. 
A magnetic field was applied parallel to the axis and a dc voltage was applied 
between the cathode and the anode segments. The magnetic field was sufficient to 
keep electrons from reaching the anode when both segments were at the same 

Magnetrons

potential as shown in Figure 19-2(a). In the absence of an RF signal, electrons 
would leave the cathode, move toward the anode, and then be turned back to the 
cathode by magnetic deflecting forces.

When an RF voltage was present and the anode segments were at different 
potentials, much more complicated trajectories were formed as are illustrated in 
Figure 19-2(b). Electrons moving in a crossed-field region tend to move along 
equipotential lines. As indicated in Figure 19-2(b), as one electrode segment is 
made negative with respect to the other, more electrons are collected on that 
electrode. When the voltages on the anode segments are reversed, more electrons 
are collected on the other electrode so a negative resistance effect occurs. When a 
resonant circuit was connected between the two anode segments, it was possible to 
obtain sustained oscillations. Negative resistance magnetrons generally operated 
below 500 MHz, were low power devices, and had low efficiency. 
 
19.1.3   Traveling Wave Magnetrons 
 
Early traveling wave magnetrons were split-anode devices similar to negative 
resistance magnetrons. An example is shown in Figure 19-3. The primary 
difference between the two was the magnitude of the magnetic field. In the 
negative resistance magnetron, the magnetic field was near the Hull cutoff and the 
frequency of operation was low enough so that an electron moved in a single 
cycloid-like path all the way from the cathode to the anode, while the voltage on 
the anode segments remained nearly constant (as indicated in Figure 19-2(b)). In 
traveling wave magnetrons, the magnetic field is well above the Hull cutoff field. 
The frequency with which the alternating voltage on the anode segments changes 
can be made near the rate of rotation of the electrons about the cathode.

In 1935, Posthumous deduced theoretically that, in magnetrons with 
multisegment anodes and large magnetic fields, RF power should be generated 
with high efficiency. He then demonstrated an efficiency of about 50% in a 
magnetron operating at a wavelength of 50 cm (600 MHz). 
 
In 1936, Samuel proposed the hole-and-slot resonator arrangement for use in a 
magnetron anode at high frequencies, but apparently did not reduce its use to 
practice. 
 
By about 1938, a magnetron with a copper anode and hole-and-slot resonators 
had been built by Russian scientists Alekseroff and Malearoff. A tungsten helix 
cathode was used and the power generated was about 100-W CW at a wavelength 
of 10 cm. 
 
In late 1939, Boot and Randall at the University of Birmingham (United 
Kingdom), who were apparently unaware of the work of Posthumous, Samuel, and 
the Russians, set about to combine the cylindrical-anode-magnetron work with the 
klystronâs advantage of using resonators for confining the RF fields. By early 
1940, a magnetron with an anode containing six resonant cavities had been built 
and operated. By May 1940, an experimental radar containing a pulsed 10-cm 
cavity magnetron was in operation and by September 1940 a submarine periscope 
could be detected at a range of 7 miles. 
 
At some point during the early development of the magnetron, an oxide-
coated cathode was supplied by Warnecke and Ponte of CSF (France) to replace 
the carburized thoriated-tungsten cathode being used at the time. The peak power 
capability increased by about an order of magnitude to 100 kW.

In an article by J. J. Coupling (a pseudonym of J. R. Pierce) concerning the 
magnetron, the following opening statement appeared [10]: 
 
 
âThe two most important weapons of the recent war were the atomic 
bomb, and radar . . . and it was Maggie, the magnetron, that made Allied 
radar incomparably superior to the Naziâs boat.â 
 
 
Modern magnetrons are all traveling wave magnetrons. The primary 
differences between these devices and the 5J29 split-anode magnetron shown in 
Figure 19-3(b) are in the RF circuit. In the 5J29, the part of the resonant circuit 
internal to the tube consisted of an inductive loop (to which the getter is attached 
in Figure 19-3(b)) and the capacitance between the anode segments. The RF 
circuit in all modern magnetrons consists of several resonant cavities similar to 
those shown in Figure 19-4, which is an early version of a pulsed cavity 
magnetron. In this tube, the anode contains eight resonators and is concentric with 
an oxide-coated cathode. A permanent magnet (not shown) was used for applying 
a magnetic field parallel to the cathode surface.

19.2   OPERATION OF THE TRAVELING WAVE MAGNETRON 
 
When voltage is first applied to a traveling wave magnetron, there are no RF fields 
and the electrons form a space charge cloud as is shown in Figure 19-5 that rotates 
about the cathode. This cloud is often referred to as a space charge hub.  
 
Because of fluctuations in the emission process and noise-amplifying effects 
in the space-charge hub, electron velocities and the charge density in the rotating 
space-charge cloud fluctuate randomly with time and produce a noise component 
to the rotating current in the space charge hub. The frequency of the fluctuations 
varies over such a wide range that the noise is referred to as âwhite noise,â which 
implies fluctuations over an infinite frequency range. While the frequency range of 
fluctuations is not infinite, it is rich in components in the microwave range, and so 
there are components present to initiate any of the frequencies that may be 
supported by the cavity structure of a magnetron.  
 
This noise current in the hub induces noise current in the cavities. When the 
component of this noise current that is at the resonant frequency of the cavities 
passes through a high impedance of the cavities at one of the resonant frequencies, 
RF voltages are produced across the cavity gaps and these amplify the RF current 
in the hub. RF current and power build up rapidly and saturate when the power 
supplied to the magnetron equals the power to the load plus losses.  
 
In the following sections, the formation of the hub, the buildup of RF current, 
and the characteristics of the cavity resonator are discussed.

19.2.1   Hub Formation 
 
Part of the behavior of the electron hub can be explained by considering the 
motion of a single electron when no RF fields are present. 
 
Referring to Figure 19-6, it is seen that there are two electron motions to 
consider. With a radial electric field, E, and an axial magnetic field, B, two forces 

Magnetrons 
 
495 
act on an electron. The force from the electric field, âeE, is toward the anode. The 
force exerted by the magnetic field, âe(uÃB), is perpendicular to the motion of the 
electron. The resulting path of the electron is approximately represented by 
combining a slow rotation around the cathode at radius Ro and a faster circular 
motion with a smaller radius ro. The result of these two motions corresponds 
roughly to the motion of a point on the circumference of a wheel as it rolls around 
a circle somewhat smaller than the cathode in such a way that its center moves in a 
circle of radius Ro.  
 
The speed of the slow Ro rotation is given approximately by the ratio E/B. The 
fast ro rotation corresponds to the cyclotron frequency so it is determined only by 
B. Although the angular velocity of this ro rotation is constant, the magnitude of ro 
depends on the initial kinetic energy of the electron so it may vary for different 
electrons. With no RF, the maximum distance that any electron can move toward 
the anode (Ro + ro) is fixed by the ratio E/B and, in practice, is about half of the 
distance from the cathode to the anode.  
 
This description of the path of a single electron is only accurate for small ro 
when RF fields and space charge are negligible.

One approach to understanding more about the electron hub is to examine a 
theoretical electron flow in a crossed-field region that is not attainable in a 
practical magnetron, but is useful for consideration and visualization of electron 
interaction with anode circuit waves. This is called laminar flow in a linear format 
and a Brillouin hub in a circular format. This flow is illustrated in Figure 19-7. In 
the linear format, layers of electrons are all moving parallel to the negative

electrode. In the circular format, layers of electrons are moving in concentric 
circles about the cathode. 
 
Because the electron flow is in crossed fields, the velocities with which the 
electron streams move are given by E/B (Ey for the linear format and Er for the 
circular format). Because of space charge, the electric field near the cathode is 
lower than in the absence of space charge and so the velocities of the electron 
streams are reduced. This results in a condition called slipping flow.

The velocities of the electron streams are of interest because, for interaction 
with the RF circuit in a magnetron, there must be near synchronism between the 
electron velocity and the phase velocity of the circuit. The electron velocities are 
given by E/B and E can be found from the voltage that produces tangential flow. 
In Chapter 4, the condition (the Hull cutoff condition) for tangential electron flow 
at the anode of a smooth bore magnetron was derived. For tangential flow like that 
indicated in Figure 19-7 at radii smaller than the anode radius, the relation 
between rate of rotation, magnetic flux density, and radius is

Although neither laminar flow nor a Brillouin hub can be obtained in practice, 
they are often considered to be present to simplify the problem of analysis. In 
these procedures, the top layer of space charge is assumed to be moving in near 
synchronism with an RF traveling wave on the anode circuit.   
 
19.2.2   The Hartree Voltage 
 
The Hull cutoff condition is derived when no RF fields are present. This condition 
defines the anode voltage as a function of the magnetic field that prevents the flow 
of electrons to the anode. In the previous sections, we have said that a magnetron 
operates at a voltage well below the Hull cutoff voltage so the electrons are 
constrained to a hub rotating about the cathode. However, under the right 
circumstances, electrons interact with the RF wave that is rotating about the 
cathode, leave the hub, and flow to the anode. This happens when the anode 
voltage is such that the electrons are rotating faster than the RF wave. Then 
electrons are slowed to the RF wave rotation rate by interaction with the wave. In 
the process, the electrons give up energy to the wave and amplify the wave. 
 
If the anode voltage is reduced, the rate at which the electrons tend to rotate is 
reduced so they give up less energy to the rotating wave. There is a critical voltage 
at which the rate of electron rotation equals the rate of rotation of the wave. At that 
voltage, the electrons can no longer give up energy to the wave and so the 
magnetron stops operating. Below that voltage, the electrons rotate more slowly 
than the RF wave and so the magnetron cannot operate. The critical voltage at 
which energy transfer to the wave ceases and the magnetron stops operating is 
called the Hartree voltage. We will show that the Hartree voltage varies linearly 
with the magnetic field and so the Hartree voltage and the Hull cutoff voltage can 
be plotted as shown in Figure 19-8. The significant voltages for a magnetron are 
between the Hartree and Hull cutoff voltages. 
 
The Hartree voltage can be found as follows. Consider an RF wave in a 
magnetron rotating at an angular rate of Ï and an electron rotating at Î¸  as 
indicated in Figure 19-9. As long as Î¸
Ï
>

 , the electron can give up energy to the 
wave. The energy, W, which can be transferred from the electron to the wave is

The first term on the right is the voltage, sometimes referred to as the âback 
EMF,â produced across a conductor of length A  moving with velocity vm through 
magnetic flux density B. The second term is the voltage equivalent of the kinetic 
energy of an electron striking the anode with velocity va.  
 
The Hartree relation provides insight into tube designs. The second term 
should be small compared to the first term because it represents wasted energy. 
This means that the overall behavior of a crossed-field tube depends mostly on the 
first term. From this, one can deduce the following four general properties of a 
crossed-field tube. 
 
 
1.  The anode voltage will be proportional to the magnetic field. 
 
2.  It will be proportional to the anode-cathode spacing (the spoke length). 
 
3.  It will be proportional to the RF frequency (contained in vm). 
 
4. It will be inversely proportional to the number of spokes, or the mode 
number. 
 
Items 2 and 4 are dimensional features built into the tube and cannot be changed 
externally. Items 1 and 3 are externally controllable. 
 
19.2.3   Spoke Formation 
 
In considering the interactions of electrons with RF electric fields, it is helpful to 
review one aspect of the electron trajectories in a dc electric field, E. That is, as is 
shown in Figure 19-10, electrons with velocity E/B move in a straight line. Those 
electrons with u > E/B are deflected downward in the direction of the dc electric 
field toward the negative electrode. Those electrons with u < E/B are deflected 
upward in the direction opposite to the dc electric field toward the positive 
electrode. 
 
When the interactions of single electrons with RF fields are considered, the 
paths of the electrons can be traced in a relatively straightforward manner. For 
example, consider Figure 19-11. An electron leaving the cathode at point A enters 
an accelerating field and is driven back into the cathode with appreciable energy. 
 
An electron leaving the cathode at B enters a decelerating field and moves 
toward the anode. With the correct frequency of operation, this electron will 
remain in synchronism with the decelerating field as it passes successive anode 
segments and will eventually strike the anode. In moving from the cathode to the 
anode, this electron acquires dc energy, which it gives up to the RF field.

Next, consider the interaction of a single stream of electrons with an RF field. 
It will be shown in the following section that the electric field pattern on the anode 
of a magnetron is a standing wave that can be resolved into two waves of equal 
magnitude traveling in opposite directions. Figure 19-12 shows one wavelength of 
the traveling electric field pattern and an electron stream with E/B adjusted so that 
it is moving in synchronism with the traveling wave. The directions of the forces 
on the electrons (opposite to the field directions) are indicated at the bottom of the 
figure and the resulting deflections of the electrons are indicated by small arrows 
along the electron stream.

Electrons near A experience decelerating forces so they move toward the 
anode. As they move toward the anode, the RF fields become stronger and the 
electrons are pushed progressively into spoke-like projections that extend to the 
anode. Electrons near B are accelerated by the RF field so they move toward the 
cathode. This produces depressions in the electron stream that extend to the 
cathode.  
 
As with individual electrons, the interaction of a single stream of electrons 
with an RF field is straightforward and individual electron trajectories can be 
determined. 
 
The space-charge cloud surrounding the cathode greatly complicates the 
analysis of electron trajectories. However, qualitatively, the behavior of the 
electrons is very similar to that which has just been described. The rotating 
space-charge cloud is distorted into the spoke-like pattern shown in Figure 19-13. 
 
Electrons in decelerating field regions move through the spokes from the 
cathode to the anode. During synchronous interaction, electrons at the surface of 
the hub and those transported to the anode move with a velocity approximately 
equal to that of the traveling wave on the anode.  
 
The spoke-like cloud rotates with an angular velocity such that it remains in 
synchronism with the alternating RF voltage on the anode segments. As the spokes 
pass the slots between anode segments, the RF fields provide a focusing action 
that tends to further bunch the electrons. As indicated in Figure 19-14, an electron 
at position A on the leading edge of a spoke is in a region where the radial 
component of the RF field is in opposition to the dc field. As a result, from u = 
E/B, its angular velocity will be reduced so that it will fall back into the spoke. An 
electron at point B will experience an increased field and will be accelerated into 
the spoke. This same focusing action helps maintain synchronism between the 
rotating spokes and the alternating field so that the operating conditions of the 
magnetron (magnetic field, voltage, and so forth) are not as critical as they would 
appear to be at first.

The energy extracted from the power supply by an electron is the sum of its 
potential energy and its kinetic energy. Since the kinetic energy remains nearly 
constant, it is the potential energy that is converted to microwave power. This is 
different from a linear-beam tube where the kinetic energy of the beam is 
converted to microwave power and the beam slows down as a result of the energy 
exchange. 
 
The operating voltage of a magnetron is typically several times the 
synchronous voltage. In the ideal situation, the electrons strike the anode at the 
synchronous velocity and so the anode dissipation is eVo for each electron. Then 
the maximum theoretical electronic efficiency is

In practice, electrons follow cycloidal motions as they move through a spoke. 
An electron moving at the top of a cycloid is moving at twice the synchronous 
velocity. An electron striking the anode with that velocity dissipates four times eVo

Electrons in accelerating field regions are forced back to the cathode surface. 
When they strike the cathode, they have sufficient energy to produce secondary 
emission. In a typical magnetron, the secondary electron emission is far greater 
than the primary emission. Secondary yield is great enough to replenish the hub 
and make up for the electrons that go to the anode. The back bombardment power 
delivered to the cathode results in heating the cathode surface. In a typical crossed-
field tube, approximately 5â10% of the dc input power is dissipated in heating the 
cathode. 
 
19.2.4   RF Circuit Operation 
 
Each cavity of the resonator in a magnetron can be visualized as a parallel LC 
circuit, as indicated in Figure 19-15. The resonant frequency of a resonator is 
determined by its dimensions as well as the reactive effect of any perturbation. For 
example, the presence of electrons near the vane tips affects the capacitance of the 
resonator. The equivalent circuit for an eight-cavity resonator is eight LC circuits 
in parallel (Figure 19-16). 
 
The magnetic and electric field patterns for each cavity are indicated in Figure 
19-17. In the desired mode of operation, some of the magnetic flux lines of each 
cavity link adjacent cavities (two lines are shown). The fields in adjacent cavities 
are 180Â° out of phase. This is referred to as the Ï mode of operation. The resulting 
field configurations in an eight-cavity structure are shown in Figure 19-18.

Now, the reason why these magnetrons are referred to as traveling wave 
magnetrons can be explained. In Figure 19-19 the cavities of an eight-cavity 
structure are shown in a linear configuration. The electric field pattern is a 
standing wave with the direction of the electric field lines across the cavity gaps 
oscillating back and forth as the RF voltage on the anode segments oscillates.

gaps. Wave positions and gap fields at times t1, t2, and t3, are shown along with the 
positions of four spokes.

The standing wave, in turn, can be thought of as consisting of two waves, one 
moving to the right (rotating clockwise in the magnetron) and the other moving to 
the left (rotating counterclockwise). At time, t1, the left-moving and right-moving 
waves combine to maximize the electric field across the gaps of the first and every 
other cavity. At this time, forces that compress the spokes are maximum. 
 
At time t2, the phases of the wave moving to the right and the wave moving to 
the left are such that the fields of the waves are opposite and so they cancel. As the 
electron spokes move by the gaps between cavities, the electric field is zero. 
 
At time t3, the fields from the two waves again add, but this time the field is 
maximum at the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth gaps. Again, the forces that 
compress the spokes are maximum. Thus, it is clear that, to optimize the 
interaction of the wave on the anode with the movement of the spokes, the velocity 
of the wave on the anode must be near the spoke velocity. Then energy exchange 
from the electrons to the RF field is maximum. 
 
 
19.3   MODING 
 
Modes and field patterns other than those associated with the Ï mode can exist and 
result in magnetron operation at frequencies other than the desired frequency. 
These other modes and the steps taken in attempts to prevent their occurrence are 
discussed here. 
 
In his science-fiction article on magnetrons [10], Pierce leads into a discussion 
of moding by commenting on the various problems faced by early magnetron 
engineers and the humorous names that they applied to the peculiarities of 
performance encountered. 
 
 
â¦The Civil War Effect, or North-South Effect had to do with differences in 
performance when the direction of the magnetic field was reversed. The 
differences proved to be due to asymmetries in the tubes, and disappeared 
when the tubes were made more accurately. The Blowing Out of Brains 
Effect had simply to do with the melting of a copper end cap which covered 
the end of the anode block of a small magnetron to form part of the vacuum 
envelope. The Gnawing Away of the Anode Effect was similar. The 
Gardarens Swine Effect has to do with the particularly precipitous descent 
of certain contours on a performance chart, and the Valley of the Shadow 
was a region of low efficiency lying close to a high-efficiency region 
known as the Heights of Abraham. 
 
 
Undoubtedly the worst effect was one perhaps too serious for a fancy name. 
It was called, simply, moding. An engineer in using an early magnetron 
would be adjusting the load, that is, the impedance into which the 
magnetron fed power, in order to get more power. Suddenly, the power, 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
508 
which had been rising, would drop, and he would find the tube to be 
oscillating feebly at some new and unwanted frequency a little removed 
from the old. Or, he would be gradually raising the voltage to get more 
power, and the same thing would happen. The tube was said to be operating 
in another mode of oscillation.â¦ 
 
 
Moding occurs because the RF circuit of a magnetron consists of many 
resonators coupled together. An analogous situation exists when several identical 
pendulums are suspended from a common support that is not rigidly held in place. 
For example, in Figure 19-20, three pendulums are shown along with the three 
forms of motion (modes of oscillation) that they can have. The frequencies at 
which the pendulums swing back and forth are different for each mode. Similarly, 
a magnetron may have several modes of oscillation that depend upon the coupling 
between cavities. 
 
 
Figure 19-20   Modes of oscillation of three pendulums supported by a movable bar. 
 
 
Field distributions for the modes in an eight-cavity magnetron are illustrated 
in Figure 19-21. The modes are designated by a mode number n, which is the 
number of times the RF field pattern is repeated in going around the anode once. 
The largest value of n is N/2, where N is the number of cavities. This mode is 
called the Ï mode and is always the desired mode of operation. 
 
In addition to there being several modes of oscillation for a magnetron, there 
is, quite literally, an infinite number of electron velocities that can excite any given 
mode. As an example, the situation existing in the Ï mode is illustrated in Figure 
19-22. The equivalent circuits of an eight-cavity magnetron are across the top of 
the figure. The electric field distribution along the anode is shown for various time 
intervals separated by one-half of a period. An electron, such as one at point A and 
time t is in a decelerating region and gives up energy to the RF field. An electron 
in the region between A and B is considered to be essentially shielded from the RF 
field by the anode segment.

The dashed lines represent the progress of electrons traveling in favorable 
phases (continually giving up energy) with the RF field. For example, electrons 
represented by line 1 have a transit angle from cavity to cavity of Ï radians and 
travel in synchronism with the traveling field. Electrons represented by line 3 
travel at one-third of the velocity of those represented by line 1 and have a transit 
angle of 3Ï radians. A complete cycle of oscillation of the RF circuit occurs while 
these electrons pass by each anode segment in traveling from one cavity to the 
next. Still, these electrons are synchronous with the RF field and give up energy 
on every third cycle of oscillation of the RF field. This situation is analogous to 
keeping the pendulums in Figure 19-20 moving by giving them a push on every 
third swing. 
 
Close to the resonator gaps, the electric field is a square wave as shown in 
Figure 19-23. If this field is broken into its harmonic components, odd-numbered 
harmonics (1, 3, 5, 7, and so forth) result, and it is found that the electrons 
represented by line 3 are in synchronism with the third harmonic component of the 
field. Similarly, electrons represented by lines 5, 7, in Figure 19-22, and an infinite 
set not shown are synchronous with still higher order harmonic components of the 
field. In principle, any of these harmonic interactions can produce oscillation in 
the Ï mode. Each of the other magnetron modes can be broken into an infinite set 
of harmonic components and can, therefore, in principle, be driven by electrons 
having an infinite range of velocities.

fundamental component is shown. 
 
 
The resulting possible array of magnetron operating conditions is bewildering 
and this is, perhaps, what led Boot and Randall in their 1976 article [4] to 
comment: âIf this point had been appreciated in 1939 it is doubtful that the 

Magnetrons 
 
511 
magnetron would ever have been made.â Fortunately, there are several selection 
processes, both natural and by design, which limit the range of operating 
conditions of a magnetron. For example, the amplitudes of the harmonic fields 
decrease rapidly as the harmonic number increases so that the probability of 
interaction at harmonics decreases. For a square wave like that in Figure 19-23, the 
amplitude of the third harmonic is 1/3 of the fundamental amplitude. 
 
As an increasing anode voltage is applied to a magnetron, increases occur in 
both the radius and angular velocity of the space charge cloud surrounding the 
cathode. When the angular velocity is such that the cloud is rotating in near 
synchronism with one of the RF modes, or one of the harmonic components of an 
RF mode, noise currents on the space charge cloud may cause oscillations to start 
in that mode. The voltages at which the oscillations are initiated in various modes 
and various harmonics are the Hartree threshold voltages. Some of these voltages 
are plotted as a function of magnetic flux density for an eight-cavity magnetron in 
Figure 19-24. The dashed line represents a harmonic of the n = 3 mode, which has 
a threshold voltage nearly identical to the n = 4 mode, which is the Ï mode. As a 
result, unless precautions are taken, operation may occur in the n = 3 mode, rather 
than the Ï mode. 
 
In considering precautions that can be taken to force a magnetron to operate in 
the desired mode, it is important to realize that the frequencies of the various 
modes are very close together. This is indicated in Figure 19-25 by the unstrapped 
line. The separation between the n = 3 and n = 4 modes is only 1% to 2%. For 
structures having more than eight cavities (in practice, the number of cavities 
usually ranges from 8 to 18), the separation in frequency between the Ï mode and 
its nearest neighbor becomes even smaller than 1% to 2%. Because of the 
frequency instabilities when the mode separation is small, structural changes are 
made to the resonator to increase this separation.

Two techniques, the use of straps and the rising-sun structure, for increasing 
the mode separation are discussed at this point. The third, the use of a coaxial 
cavity, is discussed in  Section 19.4 on coaxial magnetrons. 
 
In the desired Ï mode of operation, alternate anode segments are at the same 
RF potential so, if alternate segments are connected together by wires (straps), no 
additional inductance will be introduced because the ends of the straps are at the 
same potentials. The straps add capacitance to the circuit, so the Ï-mode frequency 
will be altered. 
 
In modes other than the Ï mode, the voltage differences between alternate 
anode segments is not zero, so the straps introduce inductance as well as 
capacitance resulting in different frequency shifts than occur for the Ï mode. The 
effect of strapping on mode separation in 18-cavity magnetrons is shown in Figure 
19-25.

In low-power tubes, mode separations of 25% to 35% are achieved with 
strapping. In high-power tubes, the mode separation is normally about 10% to 
14%. In either case, the undesired modes are at frequencies far enough removed 
from the Ï mode so that the tube can usually be prevented from operating in these 
modes. 
 
Shown in Figure 19-26 are examples of strapped structures and an unstrapped 
resonator known as a rising-sun structure. The way in which the rising-sun 
structure causes mode separation to occur is not as easy to understand as the 
strapping technique. The number of modes in the rising sun magnetron is the same 
as in the strapped magnetron. However, in the rising sun magnetron, half the 
modes are such that the large cavities control the frequency, and so the frequencies 

Magnetrons 
 
513 
associated with these modes are relatively low. For the higher-numbered modes 
(except the Ï mode), the field patterns are such that the small cavities control the 
frequency, and so the frequencies associated with these modes are relatively high. 
In the Ï mode, the frequency is midway between the resonant frequencies of the 
two cavity configurations. Thus, the rising sun structure increases the frequency 
separation between the Ï mode and the two adjacent modes (one above Ï mode 
and one below Ï mode). By comparison, in a strapped system, all the modes are 
resonant at frequencies below the Ï mode. 
 
The mode separation characteristic of rising sun structures has facilitated the 
design and fabrication of millimeter-wavelength magnetrons where dimensions are 
small and it is difficult, if not impossible, to fabricate strapped resonators. 
However, the number of resonators is limited by the mode separation requirements 
and the size of the cathode is limited by the number of resonators. Cathode size 
also decreases as the frequency of operation is increased. This limits the current 
and the output power.

19.4   COAXIAL MAGNETRONS [11] 
 
An indication of the significance of the development of the coaxial magnetron is 
that it is listed by Skolnik [12] along with the cavity magnetron and the 
high-power klystron as a significant event in the development of radar technology. 
The coaxial magnetron was developed as an alternative to the strapped cavity 
magnetron. 
 
In the conventional magnetron, the strap-vane structure results in anode 
segments that are sometimes small and operate at an excessively high-power 
density. Close interelectrode spacing leads to occasional voltage breakdown and 
the cathode loading is often excessive. As a result, in early radars, the 
conventional magnetron was often the least reliable component of the system. 
 
As Figure 19-27 shows, the coaxial magnetron contains an anode resonator 
structure very much like that in a conventional magnetron. This structure is 
surrounded by a single high-Q cavity operating in the TE011 mode. Slots in the 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
514 
back walls of alternate cavities of the anode resonator structure tightly couple the 
fields in these resonators to the surrounding cavity. In the Ï mode, the fields in 
every other cavity are in phase, and they couple in the same direction into the 
surrounding cavity. Thus, the surrounding coaxial cavity helps stabilize the 
magnetron in the desired Ï mode of operation.

Manual by Varian Associates, Air Force Publication Number T.O.00-25-251, October 
1979.) 
 
 
Because straps are not required, the anode resonator for the coaxial magnetron 
can be larger and less complex than for the conventional strapped structure. A 
comparison of anode sizes for the same operating frequency and power is shown 
in Figure 19-28. Because the anode is larger, the cathode and interelectrode spaces 
can also be larger. As a result, cathode loading is lower and voltage gradients are 
reduced. These factors all combine in the coaxial magnetron to produce relatively 
conservative magnetron designs having enhanced reliability compared with 
conventional magnetrons. 
 
In the coaxial magnetron, the multiple-cavity anode structure has a series of 
modes like those of the conventional magnetron. In addition, there are various 
modes of oscillation of the coaxial cavity. Fortunately, the use of the TE011 mode 
makes possible the use of attenuators to damp unwanted modes. 
 
In the desired TE011 mode, the RF electric field exists in circular form within 
the cavity as indicated in Figures 19-27 and 19-29, and decreases to zero at the 
walls of the cavity. Current flow in the TE011 mode is in the walls of the cavity in 
circular paths about the axis of the tube. An attenuator placed as shown in Figure 
19-29 at the junction of the inner cylinder to the fixed end of the cavity couples 
very little to TE011 currents, but couples heavily to other modes, thereby 
suppressing these unwanted modes of oscillation.

Similarly, when the fields near the coupling slots from the resonator to the 
coaxial cavity are examined, it is found that the ends of the slots are free of TE011 
current. Thus, an attenuator within the inner cylinder near the ends of the coupling 
slots does not couple to the TE011 mode currents, but it does dampen undesired 
modes of the vane structure. 
 
Another advantage of the TE011 mode is that one of the cavity end plates can 
be made movable (tuning piston in Figure 19-29) without interrupting the flow of 
current. As a result, tuner reliability is high for coaxial magnetrons.

19.5   INVERTED MAGNETRONS 
 
A further advantage of the coaxial-magnetron configuration is that it can be turned 
inside out, or inverted, as shown in Figure 19-30. In this figure, an inverted 
structure is compared with a conventional rising-sun magnetron designed to 
operate at the same frequency. In comparing the two structures, it should be noted 
that the cathode size in the inverted configuration is, perhaps, an order of 
magnitude larger than the cathode in the conventional magnetron. Also, the 
number of anode vanes and cavities can be large in the inverted structure because 
moding is controlled by the center coaxial cavity.

tion Number T.O.00-25-251, October 1979.) 
 
 
The inverted coaxial configuration has application in the millimeter-wave 
region where dimensions are extremely small. In particular, the power of the 
rising-sun magnetron is limited by the high cathode loading. This problem is 
alleviated in the inverted structure. In addition, the center TE011 cavity lends itself 
to coupling to an output waveguide operating in the circular electric mode, which 
has extremely low loss. It should also be noted that experiments have been 
performed with inverted magnetrons at S-band to determine if they can generate 
extremely high power [13]. 
 
 
19.6   MAGNETRON TUNING 
 
Many techniques are used for changing the frequency (tuning) of magnetrons. In 
one way or another, these tuning techniques employ changes in the capacitance or 
the inductance of the resonant cavities. For example, as shown in Figure 19-31, the 

Magnetrons 
 
517 
capacitance of the cavity may be varied by the movable metallic element (or 
dielectric element) in the vicinity of the slot portion of the cavity. The inductance 
of the cavity may be decreased by inserting a metallic plunger into the hole portion 
of the cavity. Configurations of capacitive and inductive tuning elements are 
shown in Figure 19-32. 
 
Coaxial magnetrons can be tuned by changing the volume of the cavity with a 
movable end plate as indicated in Figure 19-29. A fine-tuning technique using a 
compressible ring in the wall of the coaxial cavity is also shown in Figure 19-33. 
 
In another technique for tuning a coaxial magnetron, rotatable dielectric 
paddles are inserted into the high-electric-field region of the coaxial cavity. The 
lowest frequency occurs when the paddles are aligned with the electric field. The 
highest frequency occurs when the paddles are perpendicular to the electric field 
lines.

There are many ways for positioning tuning elements in a magnetron. 
Examples are the mechanical gear arrangements on early magnetrons in which the 
position of the tuning element was adjusted through a bellows using a gearing 
arrangement. Tuning speed, backlash, and drive torque are limiting factors. Early 
frequency-agile magnetrons were tuned by a hydraulic system that replaced the 
mechanical gear system. Tuning was slow and maintenance difficult, so these 
systems are becoming obsolete. 
 
There are various electromagnetic techniques for positioning tuning elements. 
In one, the tuner operates much like the voice coil of a speaker. Current through a 
coil produces a magnetic field that acts with the field of a permanent magnet for 
axial positioning of a shaft to which the tuning element is attached. Another 
example is the use of an electric motor that is coupled through a gear-and-cam 
arrangement to position a tuning plunger. Accurate tuning can be accomplished 
through a resolver. 
 
Some additional tuning techniques that make it possible to change frequency 
very rapidly are described in Section 19.10.2. 
 
 
19.7   OUTPUT COUPLERS AND TRANSFORMERS 
 
The method used for coupling power out of a magnetron differs with the frequency 
range of operation and the peak power level from the tube. A low-frequency tube 
usually uses a loop and a coaxial transmission line unless the peak power level 
exceeds the tolerable operating level of the coaxial line.  

Magnetrons 
 
519 
 
Figure 19-34 shows an example of loop coupling to a coaxial line. The coaxial 
line extends through the anode wall, and the center conductor is bent back to the 
outer conductor forming a loop. The loop couples to the RF magnetic fields in the 
inductive portion of a resonator. The size of the coupling loop and its orientation 
affect the magnitude of the coupling. Sometimes the coupling loop is located 
above the inductive region of the anode in the end space region of the magnetron. 
This kind of coupling is called âhaloâ loop coupling. 
 
Loop
Coax
 
Figure 19-34   Loop coupling to a coaxial line. 
 
 
At higher frequencies, iris coupling from the back of a resonator to a wave 
guide is used. In the example in Figure 19-35, the slot at the back of the resonator 
is coupled into the ridge, or capacitive region, of a ridge waveguide. The end of 
waveguide is attached to a flat surface on the anode with the center at the slot 
opening. The cross section of the ridge waveguide is shown relative to the full-size 
waveguide output for the tube. The waveguide portion is called the âHâ section for 
obvious reasons. The ridge waveguide section is approximately a quarter wave in 
length and has the appropriate impedance to optimize the coupling. 
 
Iris
Ridge Waveguide

Although these transitions have been called matching sections, they do not 
provide a match in the sense of having no reflected power. Contrarily, the proper 
impedance provides the necessary coupling to load the magnetron resonator with 
the correctly transformed load impedance that will allow oscillation with high 
circuit efficiency. The typical resonator system is overcoupled to do this. 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons

The matching impedance looking into the cavity resonator of a magnetron is 
very low. The exact magnitude of the impedance is difficult to calculate or to 
measure. It is always much smaller than that of the coaxial line or waveguide 
output from the magnetron. Hence, some form of impedance-matching transformer 
must be used. A convenient method with coaxial outputs is to use a linearly 
tapered center conductor to obtain both impedance and a geometry transitions. An 
example is shown in Figure 19-34.  
 
 
19.8   CATHODE AND HEATER OPERATION 
 
In crossed-field devices, electrons that are out of phase with the RF fields are 
driven back into the surface of the cathode (see Figure 19-11). These electrons 
produce secondary emission and heating of the cathode. The secondary emission 
process was discussed in the chapter on cathodes (Chapter 18). In particular, its 
significance was illustrated by the Philips YJ 1183 spin-tuned magnetron in which 
it is estimated that thermionic emission is 3 A/cm2 and secondary emission is 23 
A/cm2 for a total cathode emission of 26 A/cm2. 
 
In the microwave oven magnetron, the cathode is carburized thoriated 
tungsten for which the secondary emission coefficient is low. As a result, 
thermionic emission is the main emission mechanism. Carburized thoriated 
tungsten is used to achieve a long tube life. 
 
The importance of cathode heating by out-of-phase electrons cannot be 
overstated. Typically, 5% to 10% of the anode power input may go into cathode 
heating. In some magnetrons, this effect is such that the filament voltage can be 
removed once the tube is operating and the cathode temperature is maintained by 
bombarding electrons. Figure 19-36, which is a more typical case, shows how the 
magnetron filament voltage should be reduced as average anode current is 
increased if essentially constant cathode temperature is to be maintained. 
 
The primary effect of cathode overheating, which occurs if the filament 
voltage is not adequately reduced, is excessive evaporation of cathode material, 
resulting in early depletion and low emission. The effect of underheating is that, 
since the emissive surface is renewed by migration of material from below the 
surface and, since migration rate is a function of temperature, depletion of 
emissive material on the cathode surface occurs. 
 
Either overheating or underheating eventually results in low emission and, in 
turn, low output power. Low emission may also lead to moding, which is 
evidenced by higher voltages (resulting from improper loading of the modulator), 
lower currents, much lower output power, and a shift in frequency. Finally, low 
emission may also lead to arcing because of the higher voltages or because of the 
increased electric field at the cathode surface in the absence of adequate space 
charge. Arcing results in gas evolution, the destruction of the cathode surface and, 
along with overheating, the deposition of emissive material on critical areas.

An example shown in Figure 19-37 of a particularly critical area is the end hat 
on the cathode in a spin-tuned magnetron. If precautions are not taken, the 
deposition of emissive material on the end hat leads to electron emission from it. 
The resulting electron current impinges on the magnetic pole piece and may heat it 
to the Curie temperature at which point it becomes nonmagnetic. As a result, the 
magnetic field collapses and the anode current may increase to the point where the 
anode melts. 
 
Finally, the disastrous effect of overheating a magnetron cathode might 
possibly be best illustrated by the actual example in which the filament voltage 
schedule given in Figure 19-36 was not followed. In this case, the manufacturer of 
the equipment utilizing the magnetron did not properly understand the effect of 
cathode overheating and failed to reduce filament voltage adequately at high 
average anode currents. The result was a mean time between failures (MTBF) of 
approximately 4 hours for a magnetron costing over $30,000 (in 1980).

19.9   PERFORMANCE 
 
19.9.1   Voltage-Current Characteristic 
 
The voltage-current characteristics of a magnetron are sometimes shown as in 
Figure 19-38. Magnetic flux density is fixed and so operation is along one of the 
constant Gauss lines. Normally, the optimum operating condition is indicated (26 
kV and 38A). As anode voltage is varied, current changes, and so power output 
and, to some extent, efficiency changes. As current changes, the electronic 
impedance varies, which affects the resonant frequency of the resonator, and so 
the frequency of oscillation changes.

19.9.2   Frequency Pushing 
 
The change in frequency with current is called frequency pushing and the 
frequency shift per ampere is known as the pushing figure. The pushing figure of a 
magnetron is defined as the change in magnetron frequency due to a change in 
current. 
 
We noted earlier in this chapter that the resonant frequency of a vane 
resonator is determined by its dimensions as well as the reactive effect of 

Magnetrons 
 
523 
electrons. The presence of electrons near the vane tips affects the capacitance of 
the resonator by an amount proportional to the density of the electrons. Since 
electron density is related to current, changes in current will produce changes in 
output frequency.  
 
The pushing figure is usually expressed in MHz/Amp and is represented by 
the slope of a frequency versus current curve plotted for a particular magnetron 
type as shown in Figure 19-39. Notice that the slope is not a constant so it is 
necessary to specify the range of current over which it applies. Also, since power 
output is proportional to current, the pushing figure at current levels well below 
the normal operating point are usually unimportant because the power output at 
these current levels is low. The primary importance of a low pushing figure is that 
the pushing figure will determine intrapulse FM, and thereby will affect the 
spectral quality of the transmitting pulse.

19.9.3   Frequency Pulling 
 
Varying load impedances reflected into a magnetron affect the resonance 
condition and with it the operating frequency and power output. A Rieke diagram, 
is used to show the effects of load impedance on performance. As shown in Figure 
19-40, a Rieke diagram is a Smith chart on which contours of constant power and 
frequency are plotted. It should be noted that, for a given load mismatch and 
resulting voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), the power and frequency are 
highly dependent on the electrical distance between the tube and load. This is 
because a load may appear to be inductive, resistive, or capacitive depending on its 
distance from the tube. Thus, in Figure 19-40, for example, for a load VSWR of 
1.5, the frequency may vary from â0.7 to +0.75 MHz relative to the value at the 
VSWR of 1.0, and the power may vary from 1.07 to 1.44 MW. 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
524 
 
If a magnetron operates into a load, the impedance of which varies with time, 
then frequency and power will vary with time. As an example, a rotating antenna 
will usually present a varying impedance to a magnetron, so frequency and power 
will vary with antenna position. The use of ferrite isolators significantly reduces 
this variation. The resulting variation in frequency with changes in load conditions 
is called frequency pulling. The pulling figure is the change in output frequency 
that results when a fixed amplitude mismatch, located in the output waveguide of 
the magnetron, is moved through a distance of one half wavelength.  
 
During the design of a magnetron, the coupling of the output waveguide to the 
resonator structure is selected to optimize certain performance parameters. Strong 
coupling increases output power and efficiency but also increases jitter and 
sensitivity to changes to load mismatch. Usually, the coupling is chosen to obtain 
the best compromise between efficiency and stability.

The pulling figure is measured by operating the tube into a load with a 
specified VSWR (usually 1.5:1) and determining the frequency shift as the 
mismatch is moved through a distance of one half wavelength. In very high-power 
magnetrons a 1.3:1 VSWR is often used. When referring to the pulling figure of a 
magnetron the VSWR value used in the measurement should always be specified.

19.9.4   Thermal Drift 
 
In addition to frequency pulling and frequency pushing, it should be pointed out 
that the operating frequency of a magnetron is subject to variations in tube 
temperature. When high voltage is first applied to a magnetron, the tips of the 
anode vanes begin to heat due to electron bombardment. Then the entire 
anode/cathode structure undergoes a transient change in thermal profile. During 
the time required for each part of the magnetron to stabilize at its normal operating 
temperature, the output frequency of the magnetron will âdrift.â This is because 
cavity size determines frequency and cavity size is affected by temperature. The 
curve of output frequency versus time during the period following initial turn on is 
called the thermal drift curve. 
 
Generally speaking, the maximum drift occurs during the first few minutes 
after turn on, and slowly approaches equilibrium. In a low-frequency magnetron, 
the RF circuit elements are relatively massive and the time required to reach 
thermal equilibrium may be as much as an hour, as indicated by Figure 19-41. At 
X-band, cavity dimensions are small and the time to reach equilibrium is a few 
minutes.

Thermal drift curves for a variety of magnetron types operating at the same 
frequency and power can differ radically. Each type is usually designed for a 
particular application and small differences in internal configurations can produce 
large differences in the thermal drift curves. It should be noted that a thermal drift 
effect will also occur whenever the input power to the magnetron is changed, for 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
526 
example, when a change of pulse duration, or PRF occurs. Figure 19-42 shows 
thermal drift curves for a magnetron plotted as a function of duty cycle. The 
dashed line indicates the effect of a change in duty from 0.001 to 0.0005 after 
thermal equilibrium has been initially achieved.

In some devices, compensation techniques are used to offset the temperature 
effects. For example, bimetallic disk elements can be used in the cavity of a 
coaxial magnetron to correct for cavity expansion. Similarly, bimetallic elements 
can be used in the drive linkage to the tuner to compensate for temperature-
induced frequency drift. 
 
After a tube has reached thermal equilibrium and a stable operating frequency 
has been achieved, a change to ambient conditions, which causes a change in the 
magnetron temperature, will produce a change in the output frequency. The 
change in frequency for each degree change in temperature is the temperature 
coefficient for the magnetron and is usually expressed in MHz/Â°C. For most 
magnetrons the temperature coefficient is a negative (frequency decreases as 
temperature increases) and is essentially constant over the operating range of the 
magnetron. 
 
 
19.10   APPLICATIONS OF MAGNETRONS 
 
19.10.1   Conventional Magnetrons 
 
Conventional magnetrons are considered here to be fixed frequency and 
mechanically tuned tubes intended for use in radar transmitters that operate 
primarily at one frequency. The purpose of the tuning capability is to allow 
operation at any selected frequency within the tuning range of the tube. Because of 

Magnetrons 
 
527 
this, mechanical tuning by hand or by relatively slowly driven automatic means is 
sufficient. Most of the discussions up to this point have been related to 
conventional magnetrons. 
 
19.10.2   Frequency Agile Magnetrons [1, 14] 
 
The frequency agile magnetron is in another class of tubes intended to be tuned at 
very rapid rates. They are more complex than the conventional magnetrons and are 
used in applications for more sophisticated missions than, for example, search-
and-find radars. 
 
The requirement for frequency agile magnetrons stems from the requirement 
to change the output frequency of a radar with sufficient speed to produce a pulse-
to-pulse frequency change greater than the amount required to effectively obtain 
decorrelation of adjacent radar echoes. There are many applications and 
requirements for frequency agile systems and many of these are explained in the 
CPI booklet entitled âThe Frequency Agile Magnetron Story.â 
 
A frequency agile magnetron differs from the basic tunable magnetron in 
terms of tuning speed. The tuning speed must be rapid enough to produce the 
required pulse-to-pulse frequency difference and yet not be so rapid as to produce 
a significant frequency change during a single pulse. 
 
In the CPI literature, frequency agile magnetrons are divided into four classes: 
 
 
1. Dither magnetrons: Output RF frequency varies periodically with a 
constant excursion, a constant rate, and a fixed-center frequency. 
 
2. Tunable/dither magnetrons: Output RF frequency varies periodically with 
a constant excursion and a constant rate. The center frequency may be 
slowly tuned by hand or by external servomotor drive to any point within 
the tunable band. 
 
3. Accutune magnetrons: Output RF frequency variations are determined by 
the wave shape of an externally generated, low-level voltage signal. With 
appropriate selection of a tuning wave shape, the Accutune magnetron 
combines the features of dither and tunable/dither magnetrons. 
 
4. Accusweep magnetrons: The output RF tuning rate and wave shape are 
infinitely variable within the design limits of each device. User inputs are 
typically any waveform from random to square wave and a +5-volt 
command. 
 
 
The spin-tuned magnetron is a frequency-agile magnetron that falls under the 
dither magnetron category. The frequency can be varied 5% about a center value 
at over 1,000 tuning cycles per second. A rotary tuner mounted on a ball-bearing 
system in vacuum is used for very fast inductive tuning (Figure 19-43). The tuner 
is driven by an electric motor through the vacuum envelope by a magnetic 
coupling system.

The tuner is a copper cylinder that forms part of the inductive portions of the 
cavity resonator. As the tuner is rotated, holes in the cylinder move into and out of 
alignment with the cavities, and thereby inductively tune the cavities. In X-band 
versions of the spin-tuned magnetron, there are 16 cavities and a rotor with 16 
holes (Figure 19-44). With a nominal rotor speed of 4,000 rpm, the frequency of 
the magnetron is changed over 1,000 complete tuning cycles per second. The 
frequency excursion of the magnetron is approximately 5% of the carrier 
frequency. 
 
Because the ball bearings supporting the rotary tuner must operate in vacuum, 
bearing life would appear to be a matter of considerable concern. In the Philips 
versions of the spin-tuned magnetrons, bearing life is over 4,000 hours and, in 
most cases, exceeds cathode life.

The coaxial magnetron in Figure 19-45 is a tunable dither magnetron. The 
dither mechanism is mounted on the magnetron tuner and uses a motor with a 
small cam, or eccentric, ground into its shaft. As the motor shaft revolves, the 
eccentric imparts an up and down sinusoidal motion through a ball bearing to a 
shaft connected to the tuning plunger. Thus, the standard tuning plunger is used to 
dither the frequency.

Broadband tuning is accomplished in the normal manner using a geared drive. 
In dither-tuned tubes, the broadband tuning mechanism may move the dither 
mechanism as well as the tuning plunger as shown in Figure 19-45 or, in some 
types, the broadband tuning mechanism may move only the plunger, through a 
spline connection. In either case, the broadband tuner can operate independently of 
the narrowband tuner. The broadband tuner may be adjusted either by an external 
drive motor or manually. 
 
19.10.3   Signal Injected Magnetrons 
 
19.10.3.1 Injection Locking 
 
Several types of radar systems (for example, MTI, and pulse Doppler) use phase 
coherence between pulse signals to enhance target detection and to improve clutter 
attenuation. Phase coherence is inherent in radar transmitters that use amplified 
signals obtained initially from a reference source such as a stabilized, low-level 
oscillator. It is more complicated to obtain pulse-to-pulse phase coherence using a 
magnetron oscillator because oscillations build up during the rise of the applied 
pulse voltage from noise signals inherent in the circulating electron stream. The 
start time of oscillation is random, so there is no pulse-to-pulse phase coherence.

The only RF connection to a magnetron is the output port from which the full 
power output of the tube is obtained. However, a signal can be injected into the 
magnetron through the output port to help control operation of the magnetron. The 
signal injection can be achieved by means of a circulator as shown in Figure 
19-46. The injection signal is sent into one port of the circulator, which is then 
redirected through a second port of the circulator into the output window of the 
magnetron.

The typical magnetron oscillator is heavily overcoupled for optimum 
efficiency so the impedance looking into the magnetron through the output port is 
a mismatch to the waveguide impedance. Only a portion of the injection signal is 
coupled into the tube. The remainder is reflected back from the magnetron and 
diverted to a load (load 1) through a third port of the circulator. The portion of the 
input signal that enters the magnetron can be used for controlling the magnetron 
frequency. 
 
The magnetron power output is also directed to a load (load 2) by the 
circulators. Hence, the circulator provides the necessary isolation and protection of 
the input signal source from the magnetron power output. The maximum control 
occurs when the injection signal is at the same frequency as the free-running 
oscillation frequency of the magnetron. Injection locking can be achieved at other 
frequencies, but the required signal power level for proper operation increases 
with frequency departure from the free-running frequency. 
 
Typical locking bandwidths are in the range of 1%. The locking bandwidth 
can be made somewhat larger by increasing the coupling to the magnetron circuit. 
However, this will further increase the mismatch looking into the output port and 
requires a larger injection signal power for proper frequency locking. 
 
The ratio of the magnetron power output to the required input power is called 
the locking gain. Typical locking gains for narrow bandwidths are about 10â15 
dB. This is comparable to the levels of gain available from crossed-field amplifiers 
but only over a significantly smaller bandwidth than the amplifier. Hence, 

Magnetrons 
 
531 
injection locked magnetrons are used only in those cases where satisfactory 
operational requirements can be achieved with the restricted bandwidths. In these 
cases, the lower costs of an injection-locked oscillator are preferred to the larger 
cost of an amplifier. 
 
19.10.3.2 Injection Priming 
 
Injection locking is the terminology applied to the circuit of Figure 19-46 when the 
magnetron output signal is fully slaved to the input signal. The magnetron, for all 
practical purposes, duplicates the input signal in frequency and phase throughout 
the entire pulse. The limited gain and bandwidth attainable with this technique has 
resulted in limited use of this technology. However, there is an alternate injection 
technique that offers many of the advantages of locking, while avoiding many of 
the problems that have limited the use of full injection locking. This technique is 
called injection priming. Injection priming differs, primarily, from injection 
locking in that much smaller signals are used. Also, the priming signal is slightly 
lower in frequency than that of the free-running oscillator. The lower frequency is 
at the magnetronâs âstart oscillation frequency.â Since this frequency is lower than 
that of the free running magnetron, its synchronous voltage will be lower than the 
normal operating voltage for the tube. Therefore, the magnetron passes through the 
critical voltage for the start oscillation frequency in a very short time during the 
rise of the applied voltage pulse. 
 
Priming has a significant effect on the magnetron during the start-oscillation 
period because this is when space charge bunching is most susceptible to external 
influences. The priming signal produces a nonresonant, Ï mode, electric field 
pattern on the anode. This pattern begins to phase sort the random motions of the 
circulating space charge into a spoke formation that is spatially separated for Ï 
mode operation. 
 
As the applied voltage continues to increase, the phase-sorted spoke pattern 
rotates faster and serves as an enhanced electronic input signal that is more 
effective than a noise signal in exciting the resonant frequency of the magnetron. 
As the fields on the RF circuit build up, the resonant Ï mode is able to capture and 
phase lock the circulating space charge to that field configuration. Then sustained 
oscillations are produced at the free-running magnetron frequency. After this, the 
field pattern produced by the priming source will have no further influence on tube 
performance and so the priming signal can be turned off. 
 
Useful performance has been achieved with injection priming with input 
signals 30 to 40 dB below the magnetron output power. In some cases, effective 
control has been reported with priming signals 60 dB below the magnetron output 
power. Some early experiments were performed using low-power magnetrons, but 
more recent applications have been with high-power tubes.

19.10.4   Beacon Magnetrons 
 
Beacon magnetrons are small conventional magnetrons with peak power output 
less than 4 kW and average power output of less than 5W. Typically, they weigh 8 
ounces. The technical requirements for these magnetrons demand precise 
frequency control. The temperature stability factor is of great importance since it 
allows frequency control without additional electronics in the radar transponder. 
The magnetron must be tunable but must have the properties of a fixed-frequency 
magnetron after adjustment and locking. As a result, the techniques used for 
temperature compensation must work over a band of frequencies. Also, frequency 
stability is generally that of missile and aircraft electronic systems. This means 
that the tube must be stable over a temperature range that is typically â65Â°C to 
+100Â°C, a shock of 100G, and a vibration of 15G. 
 
19.10.5 Microwave Oven Magnetrons 
 
Microwave oven magnetrons supply 500â1000W at 2,450 MHz and an efficiency 
of ~ 70%. They are produced in quantities of tens of millions annually at a price of 
about $7 each. In 1984 [6], Brown noted that there were an estimated 50 million 
microwave ovens in the world. If turned on at the same time, they would produce 
25 GW of microwave power. No recent estimate of these numbers has been found. 
 
Microwave oven magnetrons are extremely reliable devices. There is a good 
chance that a microwave oven will operate for 10 years or more without requiring 
repairs, and at a performance level that is indistinguishable from when it was new. 
 
The essential elements of one of these magnetrons are shown in Figure 19-47. 
Pole pieces carry the magnetic flux from ring-shaped magnets to the interaction 
region between the cathode and resonator. The resonator usually consists of 10 to 
12 cavities. A 12-cavity resonator is shown in Figure 19-48. The RF output lead is 
connected directly to one of the resonator vanes. The cathode is directly heated 
carburized thoriated tungsten and comes up to operating temperature within 
seconds of the time that it is turned on. Even though the magnetron is very 
efficient, several hundred watts must be carried away by the aluminum cooling 
fins. 
 
The power circuit for the magnetrons in most microwave ovens, which is 
shown in Figure 19-49, is a model of simplicity. The anode and chassis of the 
magnetron are at ground. When the transformer voltage tends to drive the cathode 
of the magnetron positive, the conducting diode charges the capacitor to the peak 
voltage of the transformer. At the peak of the negative swing of the transformer 
voltage, the voltage applied to the magnetron cathode is the peak voltage of the 
transformer plus the voltage across the capacitor. As a result, the voltage on the 
magnetron is nearly twice the peak output voltage of the transformer or ~5,000V. 
Thus, this circuit is a half-wave voltage doubler.

The voltage waveform applied to the magnetron looks like a sinusoid with a 
p-p voltage equal to the p-p voltage of the transformer with its positive peaks at 
chassis ground. The negative peaks are negative with respect to the chassis and get 
distorted when loaded by the magnetron. The waveform applied to the operating 
magnetron is like that shown in Figure 19-50.

19.10.6   Industrial Heating Magnetrons 
 
Microwave heating using magnetrons has gained wide acceptance in industry 
because of its cleanliness, its high processing speed, high efficiency, accurate 
control, and flexibility. In addition to food processing, applications include 
product sterilization, wood and rubber curing, tempering, and controlled 
evaporation. Two frequencies, L-band and 2,450 MHz, are available for use. 
L-band systems can provide up to 100 kW from a single magnetron. The largest 
2,450-MHz units use 30-kW magnetrons. A sketch of a commercially available 
100-kW L-band magnetron, without a magnet, is shown in Figure 19-51. It should 
be noticed that the center portion of this device, which contains the resonator and 
is where the conversion from dc power to RF takes place, is less than 5 inches in 
diameter and less than 5 inches long. 
 
The operating parameters for the 100-kW magnetron are listed in Table 19.1. 
Perhaps the most significant characteristic is efficiency, which is typically 88%.

Although the operating life of a 915-MHz commercial magnetron can be 
greater, Industrial Microwave Systems of Morrisville, North Carolina, 
recommends that the tube be replaced after 8,000 hours of operation. This 
translates to a maintenance cost of about $1 per operating hour. 
 
19.10.7   Low-Noise Magnetrons 
 
19.10.7.1 Emission Limiting 
 
The carburized thoriated tungsten cathode in the oven magnetron is fundamentally 
a primary emitter as distinguished from other magnetron cathodes that are either 
pure secondary emitters or partially so. It is not generally known that, when the 
ordinary microwave oven magnetron is operated from a source of filament power

that is removed after it is used to start tube operation and from a well-filtered dc 
power supply, it has amazingly low noise properties. By comparison, when the 
tube is operated normally in a microwave oven, the noise levels may be 60 to 100 
dB higher [15]. In the low-noise mode, the cathode temperature is maintained and 
regulated by an internal feedback mechanism involving electron bombardment  
alone.  
 
Experimentally, it has been found that the tube automatically operates with 
the cathode in an emission-limited condition. This is thought to be part of the 
reason for the low-noise performance because thermionically emitted electrons 
leave the cathode with very low velocities compared to the velocities of electrons 
emitted by secondary emission during normal magnetron operation. The 
experimental evidence that the cathode is operating temperature limited is shown 
in Figure 19-52 [16]. In this figure, the observed temperature of the cathode is 
plotted against the anode current of the tube. This experimental relationship is seen 
to nearly follow the slope that is predicted by the Richardson-Dushman equation 
for temperature limited emission. The two curves were matched to each other at a 
Brightness temperature of 1,500Â°C. It was assumed that the magnetron current and 
emission current density are related by a multiplying constant.

When a magnetron is operating temperature limited, it is observed that the 
signal-to-noise ratio is very high. For example, it was reported by Brown that, with 
external microwave circuitry on the support for the cathode, spectral noise 
densities as low as 196 dB below the carrier were found at frequencies (other than 
harmonics) removed 50 MHz or more from the carrier [16]. 

Magnetrons 
 
537 
 
A second benefit, in addition to low noise, of operating the cathode at the 
lowest possible temperature, is that it is possible to design tubes for lives of 
decades. This is because the life of a carburized thoriated tungsten filament is 
highly dependent upon the temperature, being much greater as the temperature is 
reduced  [15, 16]. The emission current density requirements to supply the anode 
current of the magnetron are fortunately low and consistent with the low 
temperatures needed for a very long life. Also, the internal feedback mechanism 
that controls cathode temperature makes it unnecessary to externally regulate 
cathode temperature. 
 
One of the early applications proposed for low-noise oven magnetrons was in 
the 1980s for the Solar Power Satellite Program. These amplifiers are ideal for 
combining with slotted-waveguide radiators to form radiating modules in a low-
cost, electronically steerable phased array for beamed power transmission. 
 
Another application pointed out by Brown was that one of these tubes can be 
combined with external circuitry to convert it into a phase-locked amplifier with 
30-dB gain, without compromising its low-noise properties. 
 
19.10.7.2 Magnetic Priming 
 
The normal oven magnetron generates a high level of noise and spurious 
oscillations. Noise generated in the magnetron can leak out through filament or 
cathode leads and then is radiated outside from an ac power line. Solving the noise 
problem in magnetrons could potentially have important practical implications 
such as reducing unwanted interference with 2.4-GHz wireless systems and 
possibly providing a technique to reducing CFA noise. 
 
Neculaes et al. [17â19] demonstrated that azimuthally varying axial magnetic 
fields can be used on standard oven magnetrons to produce rapid startup, low 
noise, and mode control with an efficiency loss on the order of 10%. The new 
magnetic field geometry was implemented by placing a number of small 
perturbing magnets on the perimeter of one of the existing annular magnets of the 
magnetron, providing an azimuthally varying axial magnetic field. The two 
annular permanent magnets create the baseline magnetic field of about 1.7 kG on 
the axis of the magnetron. The perturbing magnets were SmCo, with ~3.5â4 kG on 
the face. Experiments were performed with perturbing magnets on one existing 
magnet and, as shown in Figure 19-53, perturbing magnets on both existing 
magnets.  
 
Neculaes et al. called this technique âmagnetic priming.â For an N-cavity 
magnetron operating in the pi-mode, it consists of the imposition of N/2 magnetic 
field perturbations in the azimuthal direction. The perturbing magnets are about 
three times stronger than the annular magnets of the magnetron. This is a clear 
indication of the strong azimuthal magnetic perturbation introduced with magnetic 
priming.

Using azimuthally varying axial magnetic field techniques, two magnetic 
priming configurations have been employed; the four perturbing magnet 
configuration (nonoptimized) and the five perturbing magnet configuration 
(optimized) to stimulate the pi-mode in the 10-cavity oven magnetron, which is 
characterized by the existence of five electron spokes. It is clear that these 
magnetic priming configurations distort the axial symmetry and introduce radial 
and azimuthal components in the magnetic field. 
 
The effect of magnetic priming on noise is shown in Figure 19-54. The 
microwave spectrum for an aged magnetron without magnetic priming is in Figure 
19-54(a). The microwave signal exhibits a broadband (up to 300 MHz from the 
carrier) noise spectrum. The microwave noise level is some 60 dB below the 
carrier (20 dB above the noise floor of the spectrum analyzer). When magnetic 
priming is imposed, as seen in Figure 19-54(b), the microwave noise is reduced at 
least 20 dB to the limit of the spectrum analyzer sensitivity both close to the 
carrier and far from the carrier.  
 
This magnetic priming concept has been extended for application to 
relativistic magnetrons. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations 
indicate that âmagnetic primingâ could significantly decrease the startup time for 
these magnetrons. 
 
19.10.8   Relativistic Magnetrons 
 
Relativistic magnetrons are capable of producing gigawatts of RF power for tens 
of nanoseconds. The operating voltages are hundreds of kilovolts and the currents 
are kiloamperes. Applications include testing of equipment for electromagnetic 
susceptibility and, possibly, the destruction of anthrax and other biological 
substances. A description of these magnetrons is beyond the scope of this book.

19.11   SUMMARY OF POWER CAPABILITIES 
 
The overall publishable power characteristics of magnetrons are shown in Figure 
19-55. Peak power levels well in excess of 1 MW have been available since the 
early days of magnetron development. In the laboratory, peak powers in the 
gigawatt range have been generated. 
 
Average and CW power levels are limited because the beam power must be 
dissipated by the RF structure. This matter is discussed further in Chapter 20  
concerning crossed-field amplifiers. Still, average powers approaching the 
megawatt level are available. Magnetron conversion efficiency from dc to RF is 
normally in excess of 50% and may be as high as 90%. 
 
Fixed-frequency and tunable magnetrons are available that weigh as little as a 
few ounces or as much as about 200 lbs. These weights may be reduced in 
weight-critical applications through the use of samarium cobalt magnets. Possible 
magnet configurations are shown in Chapter 20 in discussions concerning 
crossed-field amplifiers.

Crossed-Field Amplifiers 
 
 
20.1   INTRODUCTION 
 
The crossed-field amplifier (CFA) is a broadband amplifier of RF signals at 
microwave frequencies. It is a capable of providing relatively large amounts of 
output power with high efficiency. The electronic bandwidth of the CFA is 
nominally 10.0% to 15.0%. Power levels of many megawatts peak and tens of 
kilowatts average are currently being obtained from production CFAs. Efficiency 
figures in excess of 70% are not uncommon in some crossed-field amplifiers that 
utilize backward wave circuits and operate at low anode voltages.  
 
Crossed-field 
amplifiers 
are 
classified 
as either 
injected-beam 
or 
distributed-emission devices. In an injected-beam CFA, an electron gun generates 
a ribbon-shaped electron beam that passes through the device near an RF circuit. 
Operation of the injected-beam CFA is similar to a TWT. Like a magnetron, the 
distributed-emission CFA contains a cathode adjacent to the full length of the RF 
structure. 
 
20.1.1   Injected-Beam CFAs 
 
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, there was much interest in extending the 
crossed-field interaction principle of the magnetron oscillator to the development 
of a crossed-field amplifier [1, 2]. The initial work was done largely in France on 
devices that were similar to traveling wave tubes. These were injected-beam, 
crossed-field amplifiers with configurations like that in Figure 20-1. These devices 
were similar to the TWT in that they used a separate electron gun to form an 
electron beam. The electron beam was ribbon shaped and was launched into the 
interaction region between the anode delay line (slow wave circuit) and the 
negative electrode, which was called the sole by the French tube engineers. 
 
Interaction between the RF input signal on the delay line and the electron 
beam produced phase sorting of the beam into spokes much like those in a 
magnetron. The electrons in the spokes moved toward the anode, and most were 
collected on it just as they are in a magnetron. Those that were not collected on the

anode would exit the interaction space and be intercepted by the collector. There 
was no intended back bombardment of or emission from the sole electrode.

The basic elements of a backward wave injected-beam CFA with a circular 
format are shown in Figure 20-2. Very-high-power pulsed devices were developed 
in France. In the United States, much development work was devoted to CW and 
low peak power injected-beam CFAs for very wideband use in airborne electronic 
countermeasures systems. In spite of significant development efforts, 
injected-beam CFAs are not currently being produced because the applications for 
which they might be suited are better filled by other devices. For this reason, only 
distributed-emission CFAs are discussed in this book and henceforth they are 
referred to simply as CFAs.

20.1.2   Distributed Emission CFAs [3]  
 
The first practically successful distributed emission CFA was introduced by 
Brown in 1953 [4]. The device was similar to a magnetron, except that, as shown 
in Figure 20-3, the RF circuit was interrupted to provide input and output

connections. The RF structure was a strapped-vane network similar to that in a 
magnetron. The tube had a gain of 13 dB over a frequency range of 3,780 to 3,850 
MHz. The peak power output was 24 kW and the efficiency was 40%.

Since the first demonstration of the distributed-emission CFA, nearly every 
conceivable configuration has been examined, as indicated in Figure 20-4 [5]. The 
circular format is the one shown in Figures 20-3 and 20-6. In the linear format 
device, as shown in Figure 20-5, the cathode and RF circuit are parallel [6].

In the reentrant circular format, the electron cloud circles around the cathode 
as it does in a magnetron until electrons give up sufficient energy to reach the 
anode. This contributes to high efficiency and, it is believed, to improved turn on 
and starting. In some devices, a drift region is used between the output and input 
ports (see Figure 20-6) so that space charge forces cause electron bunches to 
disperse. This removes most of the modulation from the reentering cloud of 
electrons, which minimizes feedback from the output to the input. 
 
As Figure 20-4 shows, either forward wave or backward wave operation is 
possible with any of the CFA configurations. The characteristics of both forward 
wave and backward wave devices will be discussed in this chapter.

20.2   CFA OPERATION 
 
A cross-sectional view of a CFA is given in Figure 20-7 [5]. The cathode assembly 
and slow wave structure are in the center of the device. Notice that, even though 
these elements are the heart of the device and are responsible for providing the 
operating characteristics of the device, they make up only a very small part of the 
volume of the device. The magnets and magnetic circuit, the RF output structure, 
and the cooling apparatus make up well over 90% of the volume of the device. 
This section contains a qualitative description of the interaction between the 
electrons from the cathode and the wave on the slow wave structure.

20.2.1   Electron Emission and Hub Formation 
 
Indirectly heated thermionic cathodes and cold secondary emission cathodes are 
used in CFAs. The operating conditions for each type of CFA such as pulse width, 
power output, duty cycle, and so forth, affect the choice of cathode. The cathode 
selected may be an oxide-coated type, an impregnated tungsten matrix type using 
barium or thorium compound impregnants, pure metal such as platinum, or 
variants of these types. Each has its advantages and disadvantages.  
 
When cathodes are used that require heater power to raise their temperature 
for starting, a word of caution is necessary. These cathodes may become 
overheated when the back-heating power is added to the starting heater power. 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
548 
Extreme care must be taken to follow specified instructions on reducing heater 
power after the tube has been brought to operating power level. If this is not done, 
the cathode can quickly become overheated and destroyed. 
 
The cold cathode technique is used primarily in high-power amplifiers with 
â¥10-kW output, although lower power levels are possible. At lower power levels, 
the RF electric fields are less likely to impart sufficient energy to electrons to 
produce the required secondary emission. 
 
Many high-power backward wave CFAs use liquid-cooled platinum emitters. 
Liquid cooling is used to dissipate the back-bombardment power. Platinum is 
generally used where the secondary emission ratio requirement is less than 1.80. 
Platinum cathodes are inert, easily mounted, and inexpensive, and can withstand 
high temperatures. Because the thin layer of platinum (0.010 inch) is so easy to 
mount on its base metal support, the platinum cathode is less expensive to build 
than a thermionic cathode. 
 
Beryllium is another cold emitter used in CFAs. This cathode requires an 
accompanying oxygen dispenser to maintain the oxidized surface of the beryllium. 
Tubes using this type of emitter have operated for tens of thousands of hours 
without experiencing any emission limitations. 
 
With the cold-cathode technique, emission is initiated by the interaction of the 
RF input signal with a few stray electrons. As was observed in Chapter 18, there 
has been no proven explanation yet that fully accounts for the source of the initial 
electrons. In some way, as is indicated in Figure 20-8, energy has to be supplied to 
the cathode surface to produce emission

from the cathode surface have been suggested. None have been proven 
conclusively. However, many hundreds of thousands of hours of reliable starting 
have been demonstrated on many different CFAs, and the phenomenon is now 
accepted as reproducible and reliable even if not fully understood. 
 
The cathode in the CFA shown in Figure 20-7 is cold beryllium that is 
oxidized so that the secondary emission coefficient is ~ 2 to 3. As is indicated in 
Figure 20-9, this cathode is liquid cooled. Because of intense electron and ion 
bombardment, oxygen is driven from the beryllium oxide surface from BeO and 
so, if corrective action is not taken, the secondary emission coefficient decreases 
and emission becomes inadequate. To maintain the correct state of oxidation of the 
cathode surface, oxygen is supplied by a heated cupric oxide source. The internal 
pressure of the CFA is controlled at about 10â6 torr with a 0.2 liter/sec ion pump. 
Surprisingly, the life of the cathode and of the CFA is many tens of thousands of 
hours.

End hats are a necessary part of a CFA or magnetron cathode. These operate 
at cathode potential and are designed to distort the equipotential lines near the ends 
of the interaction space so that inwardly directed forces are applied to the 
electrons. As a result, electrons are urged to move toward the center of the cathode 
and this prevents electron leakage from the interaction space.  
 
20.2.2   Spoke Formation and Growth 
 
The basic interaction that occurs between the electron cloud near the cathode 
surface and the wave traveling on the slow wave circuit is like that in a magnetron.

Referring to Figure 20-10, we assume that the wave on the slow wave circuit is 
traveling to the right and that the magnitudes of the dc electric field and the 
magnetic field have been adjusted so that the electron velocity (u = E/B) is the 
same as the wave velocity. Near A, the electric field is from left to right and so the 
force on the electron stream is from right to left and is tending to reduce the 
velocity of the electrons. As is indicated in Figure 20-11, when u < E/B, electrons 
are deflected upward and the electron cloud expands toward the anode. Near B, 
The force is such that electrons are being accelerated and so the electrons are 
deflected toward the cathode.

As this process continues, the electrons in region A eventually reach the slow 
wave structure (and anode) as shown in Figure 20-12. As long as the spoke and 
wave travel at nearly the same velocity (the phase velocity of the circuit), the wave 
and spoke interact to produce amplification.

It is reasonable to ask why the spoke and wave should travel in synchronism. 
This can be understood by examining the forces on electrons on each side of a 
spoke as indicated in Figure 20-12. At A, RF and dc electric fields add to 
accelerate electrons toward the anode. The magnetic field directs electrons toward 
spoke with v > vp so electrons catch up with spoke. At B, the RF field subtracts 
from the dc field and this decelerates electrons moving toward anode. The 
magnetic field directs electrons in the direction of spoke travel, but with v < vp so 
the spoke traveling at v = vp catches up with electrons. As a result, the spoke is 
forced to travel in near synchronism with the traveling wave. 
 
As a spoke travels along, there are two mechanisms by which it causes RF 
current to flow in the slow wave circuit. First, as shown in Figure 20-13, electrons 
in a spoke repel electrons on the circuit just as a bunch in the beam in a TWT 
repels electrons on the circuit. Second, and unlike a TWT, electrons move through 
a spoke from the cathode to the anode just as they do in a magnetron. In effect, a 
spoke acts as a conduit carrying RF current from the cathode to the anode.

Electrons on the circuit travel right and left at phase velocity, vp. Relative to 
the spoke, electrons on the left move left at 2vp. The deficiency of electrons makes 
the circuit positive. Relative to the spoke, electrons on the right move at a velocity 
near 0. As a result, electrons accumulate and make the circuit negative. As the 
charges and current on the circuit increase, the electric field increases and the RF 
power on the circuit increases. 
 
At the RF output port as shown in Figure 20-14, the circuit is terminated and 
RF power is removed from the tube. However, electrons remaining in the drift 
space continue to travel around the cathode to the RF input where they again 
participate in the RF interaction process. The electron stream is partially 
debunched in the drift space, enough so that the RF feedback from the output to 
input is held to an acceptable level.

The complete picture of the spoke behavior in a forward wave reentrant CFA 
is shown in Figure 20-15. The drift space between the output and input port 
provides a feedback path that helps to limit gain to about 15 dB. There are reports 
of CFA configurations, in which part of the RF circuit is on the cathode. This 
helps isolate the output from the input and, reportedly, makes a gain of 30 dB or 
more possible. While considerable development funds went into this effort, it is 
not clear that any practical device resulted from it. 
 
 
20.3   CFA SLOW WAVE CIRCUITS 
 
Crossed-field amplifiers can be forward wave or backward wave devices and 
many RF circuits have been evaluated for these devices. The selection of a slow 
wave circuit is dominated by the form factor and the suitability for cooling, 
because the circuit serves the dual function of electron collector and slow-wave 
network.

The requirements for good bandwidth and flat dispersion limit the selection of 
circuits for forward wave operation to some version of a helix or a meander line. 
Adapting these for use in a CFA will usually compromise either the bandwidth or 
its power-handling capability because of the necessity to deform the circuit to 
accommodate either conductive or liquid cooling. The helix-coupled vane and its 
counterpart, the stub-mounted helix, provide satisfactory compromises by 
retaining the good electrical features of the helix and providing cooling through 
the vane or stub. Ceramic-mounted circuits have provided a method for 
conduction cooling through the ceramic and are particularly suited to high 
frequencies. Figure 20-16 shows a liquid-cooled meander line [6] and a ceramic-
mounted circuit. 
 
A network used by many backward wave CFAs and which satisfies the 
requirements of slowing down the RF wave and providing the proper phase 
relationships for electron interaction is shown in a general form in Figure 20-17. 
 
An implementation of this network is the strapped bar line, which is similar to 
the strapped magnetron. The original CFA built by Brown was of this form [4]. 
This network is used in many backward wave tubes that are in radar systems in the 
field. 
 
The circuit as seen by the RF wave entering from the coupler is a parallel 
plane transmission line consisting of two straps periodically loaded by a âbarâ or 
âladderâ line, the alternate bars or vanes being connected to the same strap. As 
âseenâ by the electrons, the network consists of a series of vanes or âbarsâ 
exposing RF fields, which are properly phased to extract energy from the moving 
electrons in the tubes interaction region.

A circuit which has been used extensively in backward wave tubes is the 
parallel-plane transmission line consisting of two straps periodically loaded with 
bars. It is a broadband, nonresonant structure directly connected at both ends to RF 
input and output couplers. Because of this direct connection and its circuit 
characteristics, the CFA acts as a passive low loss element in both directions when 
no high voltage is applied. 
 
A helix-coupled vane forward wave circuit and parallel-plate backward wave 
circuit are shown in Figure 20-18. The forward wave structure has a helix on each 
side of the vanes. The vanes are Â¼ Î» long where Î» is the wavelength of the 
frequency at the center of the operating band. By making the vanes Â¼ Î» long, the 
impedance of the supporting structure is infinite so the helices are electrically 
isolated from the back plate, which is at ground potential. The helices function just 

Crossed-Field Amplifiers

as the helix in a TWT does. The RF wave can be envisioned as following a helical 
path. The velocity of the propagation along the circuit (the phase velocity) is the 
same as the velocity of the spokes and so the interaction of the wave and spokes 
takes place as described previously.

The backward wave structure shown in Figure 20-18 is a folded parallel-plate 
transmission line. This line is also supported by vanes Â¼ Î» long. The operation of 
the backward wave circuit is not as easy to understand as the forward wave circuit 
is. Assume that the RF wave follows the serpentine path indicated in Figures 
20-18 and 20-19. If the spoke and the wave travel in the same direction (Figure 
20-19(a)), then, as the spoke and wave go from A to B, the direction of the electric 
field and the phase reverse (indicated by the dashed sine wave) so any modulation 
placed on the spoke at A is canceled at B. For backward wave operation (Figure 
20-19(b)), as a spoke goes from A to B, the wave on the circuit goes from C to B 
and the resulting forces are in phase with those from A so the modulation from A 
is reinforced. 
 
There are significant differences between the performance characteristics of 
forward wave CFAs and backward wave CFAs. The dispersion curves for these 
devices in Figure 20-20 show the primary differences. Recall that the slope of a 
straight line from the origin to any point on the dispersion curve is equal to the 
phase velocity of the circuit wave at that frequency, that is, vp = Ï/Î². The slope of 
the curve at any point is the group velocity, vg = ÎÏ/ÎÎ², and is equal to the 
velocity of energy flow on the slow wave circuit at that frequency. When both vp 
and vg have the same algebraic sign, the direction of the energy flow and the 
direction of the phase velocity of the circuit wave are the same. When vp and vg 
have opposite signs, then the circuit phase velocity and the velocity of the energy 
flow on the circuit are in opposite directions.

Notice that, for the forward wave plot in Figure 20-20 the phase velocity is 
nearly constant for frequencies from f1 to f3. An input signal at any of the 
frequencies within this band will be able to interact synchronously with an 
electron beam with a velocity nearly equal to the phase velocity so the circuit has a 
broad instantaneous bandwidth. Notice also that, at all of the frequencies within 
this band, the circuit has nearly the same phase and group velocity.  
 
The backward wave dispersion curve shown in Figure 20-20 has a different 
phase velocity for each frequency as shown by f1 and f3 at V1 and V3, respectively. 
Synchronous interaction between the circuit wave and the electron beam can only 
occur for a narrow range of frequencies at any particular beam velocity, so the 
amplifier has a very narrow instantaneous bandwidth. Amplification at different 
frequencies requires a voltage change to the amplifier to change the electron beam 
velocity. Hence the backward wave tube is a voltage-tunable amplifier.

20.4   CFA PERFORMANCE 
 
Like a magnetron, a CFA is a diode with a magnetic field applied. Voltage-current 
(V-I) characteristics are shown in Figure 20-21. Because of the magnetic field, the 
tube is essentially cut off until a relatively high voltage level is reached. As the 
magnetic field is increased, voltage must be increased to maintain the same 
current. Factors other than the magnetic field that affect the V-I characteristic are 
frequency (and the dispersion characteristic of the slow-wave circuits) and RF 
drive power.

The impedance characteristics of CFAs are of importance when considering 
their operation with a power supply. As Figure 20-21 shows, there is a significant 
difference between static impedance, which is simply the operating voltage 
divided by the operating current, and the dynamic impedance, which is the rate of 
change of voltage with current. The dynamic impedance may be an order of 
magnitude smaller than the static impedance. With the exception of dc-operated 
CFAs (to be discussed in Section 20.4.3), current control in CFAs, forward wave 
or backward wave, is accomplished by controlling (pulsing) the cathode voltage.  
 
As indicated in Figure 20-22, the RF drive pulse is applied before high 
voltage is applied to the cathode. There are two primary reasons for this. First, if 
the amplifier uses a cold cathode and if RF drive is absent, the emission process 
may fail to build up. As a result, the modulator providing the cathode voltage will 
be essentially unloaded, so excessive voltage may be applied to the tube. This can 
result in internal arcing and damage to the tube. 
 
The second reason for applying RF drive before cathode voltage is important 
in CFAs using cathodes heated by a heater or by back bombardment so that 
thermionic emission occurs. In these devices, RF drive is required to help control 
the space charge and to help prevent oscillations at the band edge or the generation 
of broadband noise.

20.4.1   Forward Wave CFAs 
 
The Ï-Î² plot for the forward wave CFA in Figure 20-20 shows that, when 
frequency is changed from f1 to f3, there is a small change in phase velocity and in 
the corresponding optimum operating voltage. As frequency is reduced, voltage 
increases slowly. As a result, the V-I characteristic for a forward wave amplifier is 
as shown in Figure 20-23.

Because voltage is nearly constant as frequency is changed, the current in a 
forward wave CFA  should be held nearly constant if power output is to be held 
constant. Figure 20-24 shows current and voltage as functions of frequency for a 
forward wave CFA. For this tube type, voltage is adjusted at f3 to obtain a 
specified current (22A). Then, as frequency changes, voltage changes slowly to 
maintain a nearly constant current.

An example of the power circuit used to control voltage as well as to turn the 
forward wave CFA on and off is shown in Figure 20-25. When the CFA is turned 
off, the full voltage of the power supply is applied to the tetrode. As shown in 
Figure 20-26, which is the constant current plot for the tetrode, the voltage that 
across the tetrode when the CFA being considered in this example is turned off is 
17.4 kV. To apply cathode voltage to the CFA, the control grid voltage for the 
tetrode is switched from â608V to ~+150V (with respect to the tetrode cathode). 
As the CFA frequency is varied from f1 to f3, the voltage across the switch tube 
varies automatically to apply the required voltage to the CFA while maintaining a 
nearly constant current.

20.4.2   Backward Wave CFAs 
 
The voltage-current characteristic for a backward wave CFA is shown in Figure 
20-27. From the Ï-Î² plot in Figure 20-20, it would be expected that the CFA 
voltage required for proper operation would decrease as frequency is decreased 
from f1 to f3 and that is what is observed in practice.

Another chart showing the voltage-current characteristics for a backward

efficiency of the device and is similar to a portion of a magnetron performance 
chart. The magnetic flux density is not normally a variable to the user of a CFA so 
the user is likely to receive a âone-lineâ version of this chart (as shown in Figure

When voltage and current are dependent on frequency of operation, as in a 
backward wave CFA, the performance chart will show the frequency dependence 
as illustrated in Figure 20-30. With this chart, the user can determine the variations 
in power, current, and voltage that will result from the modulation technique used 
in tuning the amplifier across the required frequency range.

20.4.3   DC Operation 
 
CFAs are diodes and as such do not have control elements like the grid in a TWT 
to turn them on and off. There have been attempts to use an interdigital structure 
on the cathode for current control but, to the best of the authorâs knowledge, this 
has not found application. It is also possible to turn a CFA on or off by pulsing the 
magnetic field, but this is a relatively slow process because of the inductances 
involved. While CFAs do not have control elements, it is possible to use the RF 
pulse along with a cutoff electrode to turn the tube on and off. These tubes are 
referred to as dc-operated CFAs.  
 
In a CFA with a cold secondary emitting cathode, it is possible to apply anode 
voltage without drawing current. Upon application of the RF input pulse, 
out-of-phase electrons are driven into the cathode surface and the secondary 
emission process is initiated. As shown in Figure 20-31, the emission process 
builds up rapidly as is indicated by the fact that the RF output power is at its 
maximum value within about 10 ns. 
 
At the end of a pulse, space charge in the cathode-anode region must be 
cleared; otherwise, the device can oscillate or generate noise. In nonreentrant 
CFAs, like the dematron, this occurs automatically, but efficiency is low, so these 
devices have not found application. In reentrant CFAs, a control or cutoff 
electrode is pulsed positive with respect to the cathode to collect the space charge. 
The configuration of a CFA containing a cutoff electrode is shown in Figure 
20-32.

The sequence of pulses applied to a CFA during dc operation is shown in 
Figure 20-32. The applied RF drive pulse produces anode current and an RF 
output pulse. At the end of the RF pulse, the voltage pulse to the cutoff electrode 
produces a short pulse of current corresponding to the charge stored in the 
interelectrode space.

20.4.4   Gain and Operating Limits 
 
The gain of a CFA is often shown on a plot of output power versus input power 
(referred to as a compression curve) like that shown in Figure 20-33. Values of 
gain shown in Figure 20-33 are typical, and are low compared with those for 
linear-beam tubes. It should also be noted that the CFA does not exhibit any region 
in which operation is linear (constant gain).

The gain-limiting factors in CFAs are varied and complex and lead to the 
chart in Figure 20-34, showing upper and lower boundaries of output power for 
given values of input power. The upper boundary can be caused by any one of the 
following factors: 
 
 
1. A limitation on cathode current; 
 
2. The onset of oscillation because the synchronous voltage of a competing 
mode has been reached; 
 
3. Sufficiently large output powers so that the drive level is insufficient to 
retain lock in the main amplifying mode. 
 
 
The first two of these limitations may be eased with appropriate design, but 
the third is an intrinsic limit resulting only from the basic interaction process. 
 
The lower boundary may also result from oscillation because the synchronous 
voltage of another mode has been reached. As with the upper voltage competing 
mode, this lower voltage limitation may be eased with proper design procedures. 
 
At low drive levels, the gain may be 20 to 30 dB or more and operation is 
limited by feedback (for example, by imperfect matching or through the electron 
stream). At low currents, if the RF circuit is designed to avoid resonances, the tube 
will produce a broad noisy output. In a backward wave device, the anode voltage 
determines the center of the frequency band and so a voltage-tunable noisy output 
results. In the forward wave case, the output is broadband noise. Crossed-field 
noise generators are built on this concept. 
 
As the frequency of operation is varied, changes occur in the various factors 

Crossed-Field Amplifiers

leading to the upper and lower boundaries of operation of a CFA. As a result, the 
boundaries change with frequency. In the example shown in Figure 20-35, the 
relationship of the actual operating current to the currents that would lead to 
upper- or lower-mode instabilities is shown. In this case, a limiting factor in 
bandwidth is the intersection of the operating current line with the upper-mode 
characteristic.

In some CFAs it is possible to improve operating characteristics by 
introducing an asymmetry into the interaction region. As an example, for the 
forward wave CFA discussed earlier in this chapter, with the cathode centered, 
performance at the high end of the band is marginal. The problem is that the 
spokes are out of phase with the RF field. The spoke phase can be controlled with 
voltage and current and current density can be controlled with cathode position. 
Thus, by pushing the cathode off-center, the spoke phase can be corrected. The 
result is that the high-frequency performance is improved and, it turns out, 
intrapulse noise is reduced. Figure 20-36 shows the cathode positioning device in 
the CFA in Figure 20-7 [5]. 
  
In practice, mode interference is often the limiting factor in determining the 
useful range of CFA operation. Mode interference is an oscillation that takes time 
to build up. In pulsed operation, the rate of cathode voltage rise has a significant 
effect on mode interference. Care must be taken in modulator design, however, 
because a fast rate of rise, which prevents a lower mode from starting, may 
initially result in insufficient tube current to load the modulator. As a result, 
voltage can swing through the values appropriate for operation in the amplifying 
mode and cause oscillation in an upper mode.

In connection with a discussion of mode interference, it is instructive to 
examine the impedance characteristics of a CFA. The input VSWR as a function 
of frequency is typically as shown in Figure 20-37. Within the operating band, the 
VSWR is low, typically between 1.2:1 and 1.5:1. The corresponding return loss 
(magnitude of reflected power) is between 20 and 14 dB below the input power.

Outside of the operating band of the amplifier, the frequency regions where 
the VSWR increases to very high values are referred to as the band edges of the 
circuit. It is at one of these band edges (the low-frequency edge in a backward 
wave amplifier) that oscillations may occur during the rise and fall of the voltage 
pulse. The resulting spurious outputs of the tube are frequently referred to as 
ârabbit ears,â because of the way they appear on a time display of the RF output. 
 
In addition to the input VSWR being very low in the operating band, it should 
be pointed out that the transmission loss of the signal through a CFA in the 
absence of beam current may be very low. This is indicated in Figure 20-38 for a 
low-frequency device. As a result, the amplifier can be considered essentially 
transparent, and this is of use in some system applications. Transmission losses are 
referred to as insertion losses and are related to electrical characteristics like 
resistivity as well as mechanical characteristics such as roughness and size of the 
circuit. 
 
20.4.5   CFA Phase Characteristics 
 
Three types of phase sensitivities are normally of interest in applications of 
microwave tubes. These are: 
 
 
â¢ 
Phase sensitivity to voltage or current; 
 
â¢ 
Phase sensitivity to RF drive; 
 
â¢ 
Phase linearity with frequency.

In a linear-beam tube, phase shift through a tube is proportional to the transit 
time of the beam which is inversely proportional to beam velocity. Beam velocity, 
in turn, varies with the square root of beam voltage. For a TWT, phase changes 
about 30Â° for a 1% change in beam voltage. Current varies with voltage to the 
three-halves power, so the phase changes about 45Â° for a 1% change in current. 
 
In a CFA, the rotational rate of the spokes in the space-charge cloud is locked 
to the velocity of the signal on the RF circuit. The speed of the spokes tends to be 
controlled by the propagation characteristics of the circuit and the signal level in 
the circuit. Also, the electrical length of the RF circuit is short. As a result, phase 
sensitivity to changes in the anode voltage would be expected to be small. 
 
In a linear-beam tube, because of the three-halves power relationship between 
voltage and current, the phase shift for a 1% change in voltage or current is of the 
same order of magnitude. In a crossed-field device, as can be seen in the voltage-
current plots, a small change in voltage is accompanied by a large change in 
current. Thus, the phase shift for a 1% change in voltage is much larger than the 
phase shift for a 1% change in current. 
 
The phase variations with voltage for three RF drive levels in an X-band CFA 
are shown in Figure 20-39. The phase changes indicated are for a 1% change in 
anode voltage. Thus, at low drive levels and high gain, the phase shift (15Â°/1% 
ÎV) is much larger than at high drive levels and low gain (3.8Â°/1% ÎV). 
 
In Figure 20-40, the phase shift per 1% change in current is shown for a 
low-power CFA with a thermionic cathode and for a medium-power, cold-cathode 
device. In both cases, the phase shift at all drive levels is small. While the 
comparison is not strictly valid because of the large difference in devices, the 
phase sensitivity to voltage in Figure 20-39 is much larger than the phase 
sensitivity to current in Figure 20-40, as would be expected. In all cases, the phase 
sensitivity is much smaller than for linear-beam devices.

The phase linearity of a CFA with frequency is largely determined by the 
circuit reflections and the gain of the device. The effect of circuit reflection 
depends on electrical length and gain. Because the CFA is electrically short 
(compared with linear-beam devices) and gain is low, phase deviations from 
linearity of less than Â±5Â° can be achieved. 
 
The favorable phase characteristics of CFAs lead to their use in systems 
where arrays of devices are used and phasing is important. This is indicated in 
Figure 20-41. Also indicated are other applications where the transparent 
characteristic is used (for interpulse feedthrough) or where tubes are readily 
connected in parallel to upgrade power capability.

20.4.6   Weight and Size Considerations 
 
The use of samarium cobalt can significantly reduce magnet and CFA weight. For 
example, a size comparison between Alnico V and samarium cobalt magnets is 
illustrated in Figure 20-42. Still another possibility in cold-cathode CFAs is the 
placement of the magnet inside the cathode as illustrated in Figure 20-43. The use 
of samarium cobalt in this manner has been demonstrated in low-frequency CFAs.

20.5   POWER CAPABILITIES 
 
In practice, CFAs are capable of impressive performance. For example, Figure 
20-44 shows an efficiency of approximately 50% over a 10% bandwidth for a 
pulsed C-band amplifier having a power output of about 1 MW. 
 
An important feature of CFAs is the relatively low voltage at which they 
operate. The voltage of less than 40 kV for the megawatt device in Figure 20-44 is 
a factor of 2 to 3 below the voltage required by a single-beam linear-beam device 
at the same power level. (New multiple-beam linear-beam devices operate at 
voltages comparable to CFAs.)

The performance characteristics of an extremely high-power (âsuper powerâ) 
CW CFA operating at 3 GHz with a bandwidth of over 5% are shown in Figure 
20-45. Output power was as high as 425 kW and efficiency exceeded 70%. The 
performance characteristics of a pulsed super power CFA are shown in Figure 
20-46. These high-power tubes were developed for use in very high-power radar 
systems, which were replaced by the development of active phased array 
technology using large numbers of lower powered tubes. 
 
The overall state of the art of publishable power capabilities of CFAs at the 
present time is comparable to that in 1985 and is shown in Figure 20-47. Note that 
megawatt power levels are available in pulsed devices at frequencies in excess of 
10 GHz. 
 
 
20.6   THERMAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
The electron beam in an efficient crossed-field device is collected on the RF 
circuit so the circuit must be capable of dissipating the spent-beam power. In 
addition, there may be a significant amount of heating of the cathode by back 
bombardment so that the cathode may have to be cooled.

The cooling arrangement used in a helix-coupled vane circuit is shown in 
Figure 20-48. In Figure 20-48(a), the thermal path for heat from the electron 
bombardment of the vane tips is through the entire length of the vanes. For 
operation at high duty cycles, increased cooling of the vane tips is required and 
this is provided, as is shown in Figure 20-48(b), by injecting coolant into hollow 
chambers in the vanes. The interception power that is capable of being removed is 
several kilowatts. The reason for using molybdenum vane tips is that, for pulsed 
operation, the instantaneous heating of the vane tips is so great that copper vane 
tips are destroyed.

A cooling arrangement for many CFA circuits, forward wave and backward 
wave, was shown in Figure 20-16. The circuit is fabricated from tubes that are 
attached to a coolant manifold so coolant is forced through the tubes in parallel. 
The circuit shown in Figure 20-16 is a forward wave circuit. By changing the 
support for the circuit as well as the technique for interconnecting the tubes, the 
circuit can operate in the backward wave mode. 
 
The highest dissipation ever achieved in a microwave tube was in the Super 
Power CFA program carried out by the Raytheon Company [7]. Dissipations of 
nearly 20 kW/cm2 were demonstrated. The technique used was a convection 
process involving a change in phase from a liquid to vapor of the coolant being 
used. In this process, as the heat is being transferred from the vane to the coolant, 
it raises the temperature of the coolant to its boiling point, forming a vapor bubble. 
The bubble then displaces the liquid above, which rushes back to fill the void left 
by the bubble when it left the hot surface. Although the bubble carries away only a 
small amount of the total heat being dissipated, it acts somewhat like a pump, 
carrying hot liquid away from the hot surface and creating intense turbulence 
within the tubing. For this technique to be used, velocities of approximately 100 
feet per second or vortex flow are needed. 
 
The vanes of the CFA were constructed as indicated on Figure 20-49. Copper-
clad stainless steel tubes were inserted between the inner and outer splines, short 
sections of which are shown in Figure 20-49. The resulting spline and tube 
assembly was then drawn to the final dimension and brazed together.  The vane 
was given a full 360Â° twist so that each of the six tubes would receive an equal 
portion of the electron bombardment. (The twist is shown in Figure 20-49 without 
the splines for clarification.) The twist also gave the water a spiral or vortex 
rotation, which provided better scrubbing of the bubbles from the wall than could 
be achieved with straight flow.

As an example of the way in which power may be divided in a CFA, the 
power distribution is given in Table 20.1 for the CW CFA, the performance 
characteristics for which were shown in Figure 20-45. Note that the anode 
dissipation is over 100 kW and the cathode dissipation is nearly 25 kW.

The severity of the cooling problem becomes apparent when it is realized that 
the total cross-sectional area of the anode segments ranges from a fraction of a 
square centimeter in high-frequency devices to a few tens of square centimeters in 
low-frequency devices. These relatively small areas may result in power densities 
in excess of a kW/cm2 that must be dissipated by the anodes. 
 
Table 20.2 contains a listing of the cooling capabilities possible with various 
techniques. Over 10 kW/cm2 can be removed by high-velocity water when 
nucleate boiling occurs on the surfaces being cooled. As a result, this is the 
cooling technique used in extremely high-power applications. 
 
Shown in Figure 20-50 are predicted power capabilities of CW CFAs based 
on anode dissipation capability. The Raytheon QKS 849, which used nucleate 
boiling to achieve an anode dissipation of 3,600 W/cm2 is used as a design 
reference point. Based on this power density, power outputs in excess of 1 MW 
should be possible at frequencies below about 1,500 MHz. 
 
In pulsed CFAs, electron bombardment of the anode results in a transient 
temperature rise of the surface during the pulse. The amount of energy that can 
safely be imparted to the anode is directly related to the heat capacity of the anode 
material and to the temperature to which the surface may rise. 
 
The calculation of the surface temperature and temperature distribution within 
an anode during a pulse is relatively straightforward. Because the heat is 
concentrated in the surface of the anode, a one-dimensional model like that in 
Figure 20-51 can be used.

nearly drops to that of the coolant-metal interface. It is because of the high vane 
surface temperature reached during a pulse that the vane tips of CFAs are 
sometimes fabricated from a high temperature metal such as molybdenum.

20.7   CFA POWER SUPPLY CONSIDERATIONS [8] 
 
The decision concerning whether to use a CFA for a particular application or 
whether itâs a forward wave device, backward wave device, pulsed, or dc operated 
is based on many factors. Some considerations are the complexity of the power 
supply, the RF power capability, bandwidth, impedance, cost, weight, and size. 
 
20.7.1   DC-Operated Supplies 
 
Concerning the power supply complexity, the dc-operated CFA would appear to 
have a significant advantage over cathode pulsed CFAs. As was described 
previously, the dc-operated CFA can be operated directly from a dc high-voltage 
power supply (HVPS) without a high-power modulator. Application of RF drive 
causes the tube to start drawing current. The tube is then turned off by removal of 
the RF drive concurrently with application of a short âquenchâ pulse to the control 
electrode to collect the electrons and interrupt the secondary-emission process. In 
spite of its apparent simplicity, the dc-operated CFA has not found wide usage. 
Some reasons for this are the following. 
 
First of all, dc-operated backward wave CFAs are not usable with frequency 
agility, because the steep voltage versus frequency characteristic results in 
extremely large power-output variations as frequency is changed when these tubes 
are tied directly to a dc supply. For typical backward wave CFA characteristics, 
the power output would vary 100% for a 10% change in frequency. A suitable 
regulator tube that would be capable of overcoming this variation on a pulse-to-
pulse basis could also serve as a cathode pulser. 
 
Second, the low dynamic impedance of a CFA sets a limit of only ~1% 
voltage droop on the HVPS if the RF power-output droop is to be limited to about 
10%. A regulator used between the HVPS and the CFA to absorb HVPS droop 
(and to interrupt arcs) would have to be rated for the full peak current and voltage 
of the CFA. Thus, the regulator would be just as big as a hard-tube modulator for a 
cathode-pulsed CFA and would eliminate any advantage of dc operation. 
 
A regulator preceding the HVPS capacitor bank can be considered, but then 
the CFA is connected directly to the capacitor bank. A CFA arc will draw a very 
large current that must be promptly interrupted to avoid damage to the CFA. A 
crowbar can protect the CFA by diverting the energy stored in the capacitor bank, 
but the power supply must then be recycled to restore operation. As a result, an arc 
in dc operation may result in interruption of CFA operation for a period of 
milliseconds to seconds rather than for a single pulse. 
 
20.7.2   Cathode Pulsing Supplies 
 
If cathode-pulsing is used, it doesnât matter very much to the modulator designer 
whether the voltage of the CFA varies over the band or not. As will be discussed 

Crossed-Field Amplifiers 
 
581 
shortly, this conclusion is reached because the types of modulators that would 
normally be used with cathode-pulsed CFAs can readily absorb the voltage 
variations of the backward wave CFA, and they still hold the operating power of 
the CFA adequately constant. The basis for choice between forward wave and 
backward wave CFAs for cathode pulsing would thus be other characteristics such 
as availability, efficiency, cost, and life. 
 
For cathode-pulsed CFAs, several types of high-power modulators may be 
used. For one or a few fixed pulse widths, low duty cycle, and moderate PRF, a 
line-type modulator is suitable and has been widely used. Regulation of the CFA 
operating power, as well as attenuation of HVPS ripple, can be accomplished in 
several ways. Line-type modulators readily tolerate CFA arcing.  
 
Among the hard-tube modulator alternatives, constant-current operation is 
attractive because the modulator acts as a regulator and because it limits the effects 
of CFA arcs, as in the line-type modulator. Besides attenuating power-supply 
ripple, the regulating effect of a constant-current, hard-tube modulator tends to 
hold CFA current constant in spite of HVPS voltage droop during the pulse. This 
makes it possible for a smaller capacitor bank to be used. Therefore, either a line-
type modulator or a constant-current, hard-tube modulator is generally preferred 
for cathode-pulsed CFAs. As noted earlier, both of these types of modulators are 
able to tolerate pulse-to-pulse CFA voltage variations. The constant-current, hard-
tube modulator maintains constant CFA current, while the line-type modulator 
(being a matched source) maintains constant power to the CFA as its voltage 
varies.

21.1   INTRODUCTION 
 
Russian scientists at IAP Nizhny Novgorod, R.A.S., operated the first gyrotron in 
September 1964. The name gyrotron was originally used by the Russians for a 
single-cavity oscillator, now often referred to as a gyro-monotron. The name now 
refers to a class of devices including both oscillators and amplifiers. As shown in 
Figure 21-1, there is a one-to-one correspondence between linear-beam (O-type) 
tubes (klystrons, TWTs, and so forth) and gyro-devices [1].

Gyrotrons fill an important gap in the spectrum of electromagnetic sources. 
As is indicated in Figure 21-2, the possible operating capabilities of gyrotrons far 
exceed those of conventional microwave tubes in both frequency and power [2]. 
The upper limit, indicated by the dashed line, is estimated with the relation that is 
valid for conventional microwave tubes, that is that the product of power (MW) 
times frequency squared (GHz2) is a constant. The value of 5Ã104 shown in the 
figure is based on the development of a 170-GHz, 2-MW CW gyrotron now in

process for  the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) [3]. 
 
Either microwave tubes or gyrotrons could operate in the shaded region 
between these devices. As gyrotrons develop and the needs arise, it is becoming 
more likely that gyrotrons will be the devices of choice for operation in this 
region.

Gyrotrons and conventional microwave tubes are vacuum electron devices in 
which and electron beam interacts with an electromagnetic field. To explain why 
gyrotrons are capable of operating at power levels and frequencies far above the 
capabilities of microwave tubes, it is necessary to first explain how a gyrotron 
works. 
 
 
21.2   BASIC INTERACTION MECHANISM 
 
 
The components of a gyrotron oscillator are shown in Figure 21-3 [4]. The 
electron gun generates a hollow electron beam, which is injected into a very strong 
magnetic field. Flux densities of several Tesla are normally required and this 
usually necessitates the use of superconducting magnets. The beam is then passed 
through a cavity where an interaction with an electromagnetic field occurs and RF 
power is generated. The beam and the RF power leave the cavity and travel 
through a cone-shaped expanding waveguide. The beam is collected on the walls 
of the waveguide and the RF propagates out of the gyrotron through the output 
waveguide and window. 
  
The electron gun and beam-focusing fields are designed so that the rotational 
velocities of the electrons are normally 1.5 to 2 times the axial velocity. As a

result, most of the electron energy is rotational. Because the magnetic field is very 
large, the rate of rotation of the electrons (the cyclotron frequency) is very high 
and the orbit diameter for the electrons is small. Because the orbit diameter is 
small, as is indicated in Figure 21-4, the thickness of the hollow beam may be 
several times the diameter of the electron orbit. In effect, the hollow beam contains 
a large number of small beams, often referred to as beamlets [5].

As is the case in any oscillator, at the initiation of oscillations, an 
electromagnetic wave originates from the broadband noise that the electron beam 
generates. In that noise spectrum, there is a frequency component at the resonant 
frequency of the cavity. In the cavity, the rotating electrons interact with the 
circular electric field of the electromagnetic wave. The way in which electrons 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
586 
interact with the wave is at the heart of the operation of all gyro-devices. 
 
The basic operating mechanism may be explained by examining the 
interaction of the electrons in a single beamlet like that in Figure 21-5 with the 
electric field. Assume that the electrons in the beamlet are uniformly distributed 
along a single helical path prior to interaction. Also, assume for this example that 
the electrons rotate in the counterclockwise direction. The angular rotational 
frequency of the electrons is the cyclotron frequency, Ïc, where B is the applied dc 
magnetic field, e is the electron charge, and m is the electron mass.

Some values of the frequency of rotation, fc = Ïc / 2Ï, are listed in Table 21.1 
along with the corresponding magnetic flux density. Since the frequency with 
which a gyrotron operates is the cyclotron frequency (or, sometimes, a multiple of 
the cyclotron frequency) it is evident that very large magnetic fields are required 
for their operation. Note that a flux density of 10 tesla (100,000 gauss) is required 
for operation at 280 GHz.

In a gyrotron, the speed of the electrons is a large enough fraction of the speed 
of light so that their mass, m, is greater than their mass at rest, mo. The dependence 
of m/mo on electron energy is shown in Figure 21-6. Now, electrons in position 
number 1 along the helical beam are moving in the direction of the electric field, 

Gyrotrons 
 
587 
so they are being decelerated and their mass is being decreased. As a result, their 
frequency of rotation is being increased. Electrons in positions 2 and 4 are moving 
perpendicular to the field so their mass is not being affected. Electrons in position 
3 are being accelerated and so their frequency of rotation is decreased. Because the 
rate of rotation is decreased for some electrons and is increased for others, orbital 
bunching occurs as is indicated in Figure 21-7 if the electrons are permitted to drift [6].

If the cyclotron frequency is somewhat lower than the frequency of the RF 
field, then the position of the bunches along the helical orbit is delayed with 
respect to the phase of the applied field as is indicated in Figure 21-8. At this 
point, it should be noted that the bunched electrons are all moving in the direction 
of the electric field, and so they all give up energy to the field. As the electron 
bunches rotate in near synchronism with the alternating RF field, they continue to 
give up energy on each half-cycle of rotation.

The interaction that has just been described for the electrons in a single 
beamlet in a gyrotron also takes place in the other beamlets. Thus, beamlets 
become synchronized and the electron distribution becomes as indicated in Figure 
21-9. As the direction of the electric field alternates, the direction of motion of the 
electrons also alternates, so electrons throughout the hollow beam are being 
decelerated by the electric field. As a result, the electrons give up energy on each 
half-cycle of operation, and thereby produce amplification of the field. 
 
We can now understand why a gyrotron can operate at power levels and 
frequencies far above the capabilities of conventional microwave tubes. Figure 
21-10 shows a comparison of the sizes of a gyrotron cavity and a klystron cavity 
for the same frequency of operation. For operation with higher-order modes than 
the TE01 mode, gyrotron cavities are even larger than the TE01 cavity.

The following is a comparison of some of the characteristics of gyrotrons and 
conventional microwave tubes. 
 
1. In conventional tubes, the RF fields with which the electrons must 
interact are most intense near the circuit surrounding the beam, so the 
beam must travel as close to the circuit as possible. This leads to beam 
interception and heating of the circuit. 
2. In conventional tubes, circuit heating limits power capability. 
3. In conventional tubes, circuit dimensions are on the order of the 
wavelength of the operating frequency and scale with wavelength so 
power is severely limited at high frequencies. 
4. In conventional tubes, the RF circuit must slow the phase velocity of the 
signal approximately to the beam velocity. These tubes are referred to as 
slow wave tubes. 
5. In gyrotrons, the field with which the beam must interact is most intense 
some distance from the cavity surface. Beam interception problems are 
far less severe than in linear-beam tubes. 
6. Because of the mode structure of the electric field in gyrotrons, the 
cavities in which interaction takes place can be very large (many 
wavelengths in diameter). 
7. The large dimensions and absence of beam interception in gyrotrons 
make operation possible at extremely high powers and frequencies. 
8. The beam-wave interaction is transverse rather than axial as in 
conventional tubes so there is no requirement for the axial beam velocity 
to be near the phase velocity of the circuit. In fact, the phase velocity is

590 
greater than the speed of light and so gyrotrons are referred to as fast 
wave devices. 
 
9. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the operation of gyrotrons is even 
more critically dependent than in linear-beam tubes on the characteristics 
of the cathode. Gyrotron cathodes operate temperature limited and so 
they donât have the benefit of space charge limiting of emission, which 
virtually eliminates the effects of variations in cathode temperature and 
work function in linear-beam tubes. 
 
 
21.3   MIG CONFIGURATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS 
 
In Section 21.2 the basic gyrotron interaction process was described. To make this 
process work properly, an annular electron beam with very specific characteristics 
is required. To generate this beam, most gyro-devices use an electron gun that is 
referred to as a magnetron injection gun (MIG). The reference to magnetron arises 
because some versions of these guns have a cathode, which is similar to the 
cathode in a magnetron. As shown in Figure 21-11, the cathode operates in a 
magnetic field that is nearly axial and an electric field that is nearly radial so that 
electrons follow cycloidal orbits near the cathode as they do in a magnetron. 
However, unlike a magnetron, the electric field in a MIG has an axial component 
so that electrons move axially away from the cathode and form an annular beam.

21.3.1   MIG Configurations 
 
The type of interaction cavity and the beam required for the desired mode of 
interaction in that cavity determine, to a large extent, the configuration of the 
MIG. A MIG can have the conventional design used in most gyrotrons in which 
the interaction cavity has no center conductor (referred to as a hollow cavity) or it 
can be a coaxial MIG for use in a gyrotron with a coaxial interaction cavity.

Examples of cathodes for conventional MIG designs are shown in Figure 
21-12 [7]. Depending on the slant angle of the cathode surface, the electron flow 
can be nonlaminar as shown in Figure 21-12(a, b) where electron trajectories 
cross) âlaminarâ as in Figure 21-12(c). (Electron flow is never truly laminar 
because of the emitter characteristics such as surface roughness, work function 
variations, and thermal emission velocities.)

The gun in Figure 21-13 has a cathode with a very steep slant angle (50Â°) [8]. 
This angle was critical in minimizing the transverse velocity spread of the 
electrons. Also, the beam is relatively insensitive to electrode misalignments and 
field errors. A transverse relative velocity spread of 1.6% and a transverse-to-axial 
velocity ratio of 1.5 was obtained in simulations for a 6-A, 65-kV beam.

The magnetic field in a gyrotron focuses the electron beam and also 
establishes the frequency of operation. The variation in the field as the beam 
travels from the MIG to and through the interaction region is enormous. This 
variation is indicated in Figure 21-15 for a 140-GHz gyrotron [11].

The rotation frequency of the electrons varies over an extremely wide range as 
the beam is compressed and travels from the MIG to the interaction region. 
Because of this, the beam can couple to and excite resonances in the MIG and in 
the tunnel (compression zone) leading to the interaction region. To suppress these 
resonant interactions, absorbing material is placed on the walls of the tunnel to the 
interaction region as is indicated in Figure 21-16.

21.3.2   First-Order Design Procedure 
 
As is the case with linear-beam tubes, the design of the electron gun depends on 
numerical simulation to determine beam performance and ensure proper interface 
with the RF circuit. Also, it is very important to have a good starting design before 
proceeding with the simulation. This is the value of the Vaughan synthesis 
procedure for Pierce guns (Chapter 6). 
 
Baird [12, 13] and Lawson [13] provided seven equations for obtaining a 
first-order design for the MIG configuration shown in Figure 21-17. The following 
material is from their analysis.  
 
There are five MIG design parameters, which are required by the RF 
interaction region1: 
                                                 
1 By comparison, there are three Pierce-gun design parameters, which are set by the RF 
interaction region; beam voltage, beam current or perveance, and beam radius. These are 
comparable to items 1, 2, and 4. The magnetic field is established by these three quantities 
and is used only for focusing the beam. In the gyrotron, the magnetic field guides the beam 
and determines the frequency of operation so it must be specified in the gun design. The 
only place where the transverse velocities are of considerable importance in linear-beam 
tube design is in confined flow PPM-focused beams. There, a considerable amount of 
energy can be expended in transverse velocities, which do not contribute to RF performance 
and so tube efficiency suffers. In the gyrotron, the efficiency of the interaction depends on 
the fraction of beam power that is in the transverse motion of the electrons.

1. Beam power; 
 
2.  Electron energy; 
 
3. Required cyclotron frequency;  
 
4. Average radius of the electron guiding centers; 
 
5. Transverse-to-longitudinal velocity ratio. 
 
 
These parameters are usually well known and relatively fixed in value. They 
determine the RF interaction region values of the voltage and current (Vo and Io), 
the transverse and longitudinal velocity components vâ´o and vzo, the magnetic 
field Bo, and the position and size of the orbits (rgo = mean guiding center radius 
and rL o = Larmor radius). The transverse velocity and the radii are shown in 
Figure 21-18, which is a cross section of the electron beam downstream from the 
MIG. 
 
In addition to the design parameters required by the RF interaction region, 
there are additional variables in the MIG design that can be used to form a 
satisfactory beam. Baird and Lawson selected the following four variables: 2 
 
 
1. rc, the average cathode radius; 
 
2. Jc, the cathode current density; 
 
3. Ïc, the slope angle of the cathode; 
 
4. DF, the spacing factor between the cathode and first anode of the MIG. 
                                                                                                                
 
2 In the Pierce gun design, only two additional design parameters, rc and Jc, are required.

The most important trade-off variable is the cathode radius, rc. Baird and Lawson 
noted that it is usually very helpful in arriving at a suitable cathode radius to plot 
all the calculated variables together on a single plot versus rc. Identification of the 
acceptable ranges of the calculated variables then makes it possible to quickly 
identify the acceptable design range for rc. Also, in some cases it may be found 
that there is no acceptable range for rc due to a high level of space charge in the 
gun. 
 
21.3.2.1 Magnetic Field Compression Ratio 
 
The starting point in the analysis is the conservation of angular momentum which 
gives the magnetic field compression ratio.3 This is the reduction in the beam 
cross-sectional area that results from the increase in magnetic field as the beam 
moves from the gun to the interaction region. Conservation of angular-momentum 
for electron trajectories in cylindrically symmetric dc fields E(r, z) and B(r, z), can 
be written (assuming the near axis approximation Bz = Bz(z) only) as

3 In linear-beam tubes, Buschâs theorem, which is an adaptation of the conservation of 
momentum, is used, primarily in the electron gun, to find the rate of beam rotation as 
electrons cross magnetic field lines and enter the main focusing field.

21.3.2.2 Slant Length of Cathode 
 
The emitting area of the cathode in the MIG must be large enough to supply the 
specified beam current, Io, at the selected cathode current density, Jo.  This leads to 
the second Baird and Lawson equation for determining the ratio Ls/Rc where Ls = 
ls/rLo is the normalized slant length of the cathode. This comes from area 
calculations of a conical segment of the cathode. 
 
21.3.2.3 Spread in Guiding Centers 
  
By combining the slant length with the magnetic field compression ratio, the third 
Baird and Lawson design equation for the spread Î´Rg in the guiding centers in the 
interaction region of the beam can be determined. This is an important design 
quantity, which must be controlled in a MIG because a large spread in the guiding 
centers is usually associated with a decrease in the RF interaction efficiency. 
 
21.3.2.4 Distance from Cathode to Anode 
  
The fourth Baird and Lawson equation relates the slant distance, d, from the 
cathode to the anode (see Figure 21-17) to the Larmor radius at the cathode. This 

Gyrotrons 
 
597 
equation says that the increase in distance from the cathode to the anode along the 
path d is proportional to rLc. When d < 2rLc, beam interception on the first anode 
occurs. As d is made larger than 2rLC, the clearance between the beam and the first 
anode increases and a higher voltage on the first anode is required. 
 
21.3.2.5 Anode Voltage 
 
The voltage, Va, which is required on the first anode to produce the specified 
transverse beam velocity, is estimated from the fifth Baird and Lawson relation. 
This equation is derived using conservation of angular momentum from the 
cathode surface to the first peak in the Larmor orbit above the cathode. A 
relativistic Hull cutoff equation is found, and this establishes the potential at the 
first beam peak (peak of the first Larmor orbit). Then, using modified coaxial line 
equations, the voltage on the anode is determined. 
 
21.3.2.6 Electric Field at Cathode and Lower Bound on Cathode Radius 
 
The final two design equations provide the most important information required to 
assess the viability of any given design choices. The sixth relation gives the 
electric field required at the cathode to achieve the desired beam performance. If 
this field is above the acceptable design limit of about 100 kV/cm, the MIG is in 
danger of arcing during operation. (The actual field levels resulting from field 
enhancements should be limited to 100 kV/cm. The field on the nose of the 
cathode electrode tends to be the highest stress point.) If the electric field for a 
given design is too high, the primary remedy is to increase rc. Thus the sixth 
relation sets a lower bound on acceptable values of the cathode radius. 
 
21.3.2.7 Upper Bound on Cathode Radius 
 
Baird and Lawsonâs seventh equation alternatively sets an upper bound on rc. This 
equation gives the ratio of the beam current density Jc to the space charge limiting 
current density, JL. As the cathode radius is increased, the space charge limiting 
current decreases very rapidly and the ratio Jc/JL increases quickly to its maximum 
value of unity. MIG design, however, is based on negligible space-charge effects. 
It is, therefore, mandatory that JclJL be kept below about 15â20% to rely on these 
design rules. The seventh equation, therefore, imposes an upper bound on rc, 
which cannot be exceeded without finding some method for including the effects 
of space-charge in the design process. 
 
The MIG in Figure 21-19 is an example of the application of Baird and 
Lawsonâs  analysis to the design of a 600-kW, 70-kV MIG for use at 35 GHz. 
Even though the gun design has two anodes, full beam voltage was applied to the 
first anode to create a smoothly varying E-field in the cathode-anode region to 
better approximate adiabatic flow conditions.

21.3.3   MIG Performance 
 
Gyrotrons share an extremely important characteristic with other electron devices 
that operate in vacuum. That is, the electron beam must be, and must remain for 
the duration of the life of the device, nearly perfect. For optimum gyrotron 
performance, there are very stringent requirements on the MIG and on the electron 
beam that it provides, including the following.

21.3.3.1 Transverse Velocity 
 
First, only the transverse energy of the electrons can be converted to RF power 
output. If the ratio of transverse to axial velocity of the electrons is Î±, then the 
maximum efficiency of conversion of beam power to the RF field is

This means that the transverse to axial velocity ratio should be as high as possible. 
Ratios between 1.5 and 2 are typical. 
 
The transverse velocity spread must be as low as possible to help ensure 
phase-bunching stability. Velocity spread is a function of many factors: 
 
 
1. MIG cathode slant angle. Figure 21-20 shows an example calculated for a 
94-GHz gyrotron [8]. 
 
2. The presence of space charge. The cathodes in MIG guns are operated 
temperature limited to avoid instabilities that occur in the space charge 
cloud that surrounds the cathode in magnetron-type cathodes. Brown [14] 

Gyrotrons

reported a reduction in noise by 60 dB or more from a magnetron when 
cathode temperature was reduced so that operation was temperature 
limited rather than space-charge limited (see Chapter 19).

21.3.3.2 Emission 
 
The cathodes in MIGs operate temperature limited (TL) with a current that is 15â
20% of the space charge limited current. Thermionic emission is strongly 
dependent on temperature and work function. From the Richardson-Dushman 
equation, emission current changes by a factor of 2 when cathode temperature 
changes 40K or work function changes 0.06 eV. 
 
In most cases, the first indication of an emission problem occurs after the 
cathode is installed and testing has begun. Then it becomes difficult to determine 
if the problem was caused by the cathode or something else. Problems that are 
thought to have resulted from nonuniform cathode temperature or work function 
are [15]: 
 
1. Communications and Power Industries, Inc. reported 10:1 azimuthal 
variations in power density of the electron beam in the collector for a 
140-GHz gyrotron [16]. 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
600 
2. MIT found that asymmetries in emission for a coaxial gyrotron produced 
a 6:1 variation in current with angular position [17]. When the electron 
gun was replaced with one having more uniform emission (1.2:1), the 
output power doubled. 
3. Researchers in Germany reported problems with a 1-MW, long-pulse 
gyrotron at 140 GHz built by Thales Electron Devices. The prototype 
device failed to achieve the power specification even though a 
preprototype gyrotron exceeded the power requirement. The only relevant 
difference between the two gyrotrons was a change in the cathode. It is 
suspected that nonuniform emission in the prototype gyrotron caused the 
reduced performance [15]. 
 
4. At Saint Petersburg State Polytechnic University [18], Gennadi et al. 
developed a gyrotron with internal probes in the collector and anode for 
measuring the azimuthal current distribution in the beam. Their research 
demonstrated that significant degradations in efficiency occur when there 
are variations in the azimuthal current distribution [15]. 
 
 
Nonuniform heating, thermal shorts, poor thermomechanical design, or flaws 
or voids in heater potting can cause temperature variations. Fortunately, these 
problems can often be detected prior to installation by energizing the cathode 
heater in a vacuum bell jar.  
 
Variations in work function are a larger problem that have been battled by the 
tube industry for decades. Often, it is not clear what is causing these problems. 
Possibilities include pore smearing, nonuniform impregnation, nonuniform 
porosity, braze contamination, and incomplete infiltrant removal. 
 
Before leaving the subject of work function, we should return to the work of 
Miram et al. on emission spread, which was discussed in Chapter 5 [19]. Emission 
spread is defined at a specific TL operating point (Miram used 40% of FSCL 
current) and is the difference between the calculated (Richardson-Dushman) work 
function that produces the emitted current and the lowest measurable work 
function for the cathode emission characteristic. For a typical dispenser cathode, 
emission spread is ~0.04 eV. By comparison, as is indicated in Figure 21-21, the 
emission spread determined in tests on a scandate cathode was 0.02 eV. (The 
lowest measurable work function in a test for a scandate cathode was 1.52 eV.)  
 
A small emission spread like that shown here indicates that, at a temperature 
of 700Â°C, the work function distribution (WFD) is very narrow. It has been 
reported that WFD variation is one of the main reasons for emission 
nonuniformity, which leads to reduced gyrotron efficiency and parasitic 
oscillations [20].

21.4   BEAM-WAVE INTERACTION  
 
The operating mode that we have discussed so far has been the TE01 mode 
(Figures 21-9, 21-10, and 21-19) and the cavities have been hollow cavities, that 
is, there is no center conductor in the cavities. In this section we discuss coaxial 
cavities as well as hollow cavities and modes of operation that are far more 
complex than the TE01 mode. MIGs for supplying beams to hollow and to coaxial 
cavities were discussed in the previous section. 
 
21.4.1   Hollow Cavities 
 
Most high-power gyrotrons use highly overmoded cavities. The TE01 cavity mode 
used in the discussion in the previous section has constant electric field in the 
azimuthal direction and one maxima in the radial direction. Overmoded cavities 
can have several cycles of variation in the field in the azimuthal direction and 
several maxima in the radial direction. Cavities may be hollow or coaxial.  
 
Examples of radial field variations in hollow cavities are shown in Figure 
21-22 [21]. Five different waveguide modes are shown. The placement of hollow 
electron beams for maximum interaction with these modes at the fundamental 
cyclotron frequency is also shown. In general, TE0n modes (n > 1) are used to 
increase the power handling capacity of the device while retaining the favorable 
field geometry and mode control properties of these modes. The TE52 and TE91 
modes are used because the fields are localized near the outside wall of the cavity. 
These are called âwhispering-galleryâ modes. With the fields localized near the 
wall of the cavity, it is possible to use a large radius electron beam and, at the 
same time, preferentially excite the desired operating mode. These modes, 
therefore, permit a measure of mode control in a large overmoded cavity with an 
enlarged (high-power) electron beam.

Figure 21-23 [2]. This is a plot of the magnitude of the square of the electric field 
as functions of the radial and azimuthal directions for the TE62 mode. Electron 
orbits and electric field lines for maximum interaction with the electrons are

It is helpful in explaining the operation of an overmoded cavity like the cavity 
with the TE62 mode in Figure 21-23, to âunrollâ the field pattern and show it in a 
linear manner as in Figures 21-24 and 21-25. The field has six cycles of variation 
in the azimuthal direction and one cycle (two maxima) in the radial direction.

As a function of time, the fields vary as shown in Figure 21-25. Electron 
orbits are shown to rotate in synchronism with the alternating field. If one 
particular phase of the wave is chosen, such as the phase of the peak field, the 
wave appears to move to the right (rotate in the clockwise direction in the cavity). 
Notice that the phase of the field peaks could have been chosen so that the wave 
would appear to rotate counterclockwise. The TE62 mode is referred to as a 
rotating mode and, in fact, all TEmn modes with m â  0 are rotating modes.

The apparent rotation of the mode in the gyrotron cavity can be compared to 
the âtraveling waveâ in a magnetron. Figure 21-26 depicts an eight cavity 
magnetron that has been unrolled [22]. Only the anode segments that make up the 
capacitive portion of the cavities are shown. As the cavity fields oscillate, the 
potential across the gaps alternates. For an electron spoke that is rotating about the 
cathode to continuously interact with the anode field, the spoke must travel at the 
speed of the traveling anode wave. Thus, this magnetron, like all modern 
magnetrons, is referred to as a traveling wave magnetron.

So we see that the magnetron and the TEmn mode gyrotron (m â  0) are both 
traveling wave devices. The difference between them is that in the magnetron, the 
electrons must travel with the field, whereas in the gyrotron the electrons stay 
relatively stationary and spin in small orbits in synchronism with the alternating 
field as the field travels past them.  
 
21.4.2   Coaxial Cavities 
 
At very high frequencies and ultrahigh powers, high ohmic wall losses and/or 
mode competition problems limit the capabilities of gyrotrons. There is an 
argument to be made for gyrotrons with coaxial cavities because mode 
competition is reduced, so it possible to use even higher-order modes than in 
hollow resonators [11]. Also, the inner rod helps in limiting the potential 
depression caused by space charge effects and ultrafast frequency step tuning is 
possible by applying an appropriate voltage to the coaxial insert. 
 
In a coaxial cavity, ohmic losses can be controlled by corrugating the center 
conductor as is indicated in Figures 21-27 and 21-28. If axial rectangular groves 
are placed in the center conductor, which are 1/4Î» deep, the impedance of the 
surface of the center conductor at the frequency of interest appears to be infinite, 
so currents and losses  are very low [23].

In either a hollow cavity or a coaxial cavity, the tunnel expands from the 
cavity to the output window so RF propagates towards the window. The tunnel 
contracts toward the gun and this prevents propagation of the RF wave toward the 
gun. 
 
Figure 21-28 shows the transverse field of the TE31,17 mode in a high-order 
mode coaxial cavity [4]. The corrugations in the center conductor are 0.45 mm 
deep and 0.35 mm wide and the number of grooves is 72.

21.4.3   Mode Converters [24, 25] 
 
 
The output mode of a high-power gyrotron is a TE0n or TEmn mode in a circular 
waveguide. For most applications, these modes are not suitable for use because of 
serious diffraction and polarization losses. To be of use, they must be converted 
into the Gaussian mode or lower-order linearly polarized mode (HE11). The 
conventional waveguide mode converters that were used in early gyrotrons are in 
the form of rippled-wall or corrugated circular waveguides and serpentine 
structures. These devices have high efficiency but are large and have narrow 
bandwidth, so they are not appropriate for use in high-power gyrotrons. 
 
The short-wavelength, high-output power and the rotating asymmetric high-
order cavity modes have led to the need for quasi-optical mode conversion 
concepts, which were first developed in Russia [26] and are known as Vlasov 
converters. The Denison quasi-optical converter [27], which is a  modification of 
the Vlasov converter is compact and can be placed between the gyrotron cavity 
and the output window. This is a highly efficient way to transform the complex 
circular cavity mode into a linearly polarized Gaussian beam. Efficient conversion 
is crucial for high-power gyrotrons to avoid severe cooling problems and, 
possibly, to avoid device destruction. An additional benefit of these quasi-optical 
converters is that they make it possible to separate the RF beam from the electron 
beam. This will be discussed in Section 21.5.1. 
 
The basic principles of quasi-optical mode converters for circular symmetric 
(TE0n) modes and rotating asymmetric (TEmn) modes are shown in Figures 21-29 
and 21-30.  As in Figures 21-24 and 21-25, the field patterns are unrolled to 
simplify the visualization of the operation of the mode launchers that are part of 
the quasi-optical converters.

Because the TE0n modes have no variations in the field in the azimuthal 
direction, all parts of a wave crest arrive at the launcher simultaneously and so the 
launcher has a square-cut end for launching the wave. In contrast to this, TEmn 
modes have cyclical variations in the field in the azimuthal direction. By cutting

the launcher at the appropriate angle as shown in Figure 21-30, wave fronts, all 
parts of which are in phase, can be launched. After being reflected by an 
appropriately shaped mirror (quasi-parabolic) a beam of parallel rays is formed 
(Figure 21-31).

A quasi-optical mode converter has been theoretically and experimentally 
investigated at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The converter was 
developed for the 2-MW, 170-GHz, TE34,19 mode coaxial-cavity ITER gyrotron. 
The converter, shown in Figure 21-32, consists of a launcher, a quasi-elliptical 
mirror, and two toroidal mirrors [28].  
 
Theoretical and experimental results show that the TEM00 fundamental 
gaussian mode content (FGMC) of the RF beam from the ITER gyrotron is about 
96.7% at the window plane. To improve the FGMC further, and then to decrease 
the stray radiation in the tube, two adapted phase correcting mirrors have been 
designed. The simulation results show that with these mirrors, the FGMC can be 
increased to 99.1% at the output window plane and the stray radiation can be 
decreased by 0.6%. A CVD diamond output window that is used at high-power 
levels with a quasi-optical converter is described in Chapter 22.

21.4.4   Harmonic Operation 
 
With the proper shape for the RF field, it is possible for harmonic interactions with 
the electrons to occur. In the example shown in Figure 21-33, the field varies at 
twice the cyclotron frequency. The direction of the field reverses in the center of 
the electron orbit.  
 
Thus, an electron that is initially decelerated by the field Figure 21-33(a), is 
moving transverse to the field when the field reverses Figure 21-33(b) and so its 
orbital energy is not changed. By the time the field reverses again, the electron has 
moved another 90Â° around its orbit and is again in a decelerating field. Thus, 
during each orbit of the electron, the RF field goes through two complete cycles. 
For a given operating frequency, the cyclotron frequency is half the value used in 
the fundamental mode of operation. As a result, the magnetic field is reduced by a 
factor of 2.

21.4.5   Collectors 
 
Collectors, including depressed collectors, for linear-beam tubes were discussed in 
Chapter 16. There is usually very little magnetic field in those collectors and the 
shape of the beam entering the collector is controlled by space charge forces and 
electric field configurations so the design of the undepressed collectors is 
relatively straightforward. In TWTs, the interaction of the beam with the circuit is 
relatively weak and the energy spread of the electrons in the spent beam is about 
30â40% of the initial beam energy. This makes it possible to design depressed 
collectors having as many as 10 stages of depression and to achieve overall 
efficiencies over 70%. 
 
The author of this book is not aware of undepressed collectors for linear-beam 
tubes that operate at power levels above 1 MW or depressed collectors for linear-
beams that operate at power levels above 100 kW. 
 
For high-power gyrotrons, on the other hand, collectors and even depressed 
collectors are being designed to operate at power levels over 2-MW CW. The 
design of these collectors is particularly challenging because the magnetic field in 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
610 
the collector may be several tens of gauss and the energy range of the electrons in 
the spent beam can be 35â140% of the incident beam energy [11]. Still, single-
stage depressed collectors have been used on high-power gyrotrons and have 
increased the overall efficiency to above 50% [29â31]. Although these 
experiments were limited to single stage collectors they demonstrated the value of 
depressed collectors in reducing the power loading, X-ray generation, and, 
possibly, of using less costly power supplies. 
 
In a high-frequency gyrotron the magnetic flux density in the interaction 
region is several tens of tesla. In going from the interaction region to the collector, 
the flux density decreases to several tens of gauss. Electrons follow the expanding 
flux lines in the collector and land on a ring-shaped band on the collector surface, 
the width of which can be estimated. Thus, knowing the beam current and voltage, 
the power density imparted to the collector surface (the wall loading) can be 
estimated. In high-power gyrotrons, the diameter of the collector has to be 
excessively large to keep the wall loading within the technological limit of ~500 
W/cm2 [11]. It should be noted here that in linear-beam tube design, the wall 
loading limit is ~1 kW/cm2 (Chapter 16). 
 
 If the radius of the collector is to be limited, the width of the band on which 
the electrons land must be made larger. Auxiliary collector coils can be used to 
widen the interception band. In the collector in Figure 21-34, these coils are 
located in the insert in the center of the collector [32]. The second way to reduce 
loading is to use sweeping coils to move the electron beam axially in the collector. 
In one example [33] the sweep frequency was 10â15 Hz and the magnetic 
induction was 100â500 gauss.

21.5   GYRO-MONOTRONS (OSCILLATORS) 
 
Gyro-monotrons are usually referred to simply as gyrotrons. Cross-sectional 
drawings are shown in Figures 21-35 through 21-37. The device depicted in Figure 
21-35 is typical of gyrotrons that are capable of modest RF output powers [34]. At 
very high-power levels, the drawing in Figure 21-36 is a cross-sectional view of 
the device [35]. The main differences between these devices are illustrated in 
Figure 21-37 [36].

21.5.1   RF Output Coupling 
 
Early 200-kW TE0n-mode gyrotrons (e.g., TE02 mode) having the classical 
cylindrical symmetric configuration employ standard output coupling. As shown 
in Figure 21-37(a), the electron beam collector also serves as the output waveguide. 
For CW gyrotrons operating at the megawatt level, the quasi-optical mode 
converter makes it possible to separate the spent electron beam from the outgoing 
RF power as in Figure 21-37(b). This makes it possible to increase the collector 
beam interception area [36]. Also, it makes it possible to depress the collector. 
 
Gyro-monotrons can produce extremely high powers at very high frequencies. 
A good example is the device being developed for ITER. To fulfill the needs of 
ITER, gyrotrons with a hollow waveguide cavity with 1-MW output power are 
currently under development in Japan and Russia. Also for ITER, the EU gyrotron 
consortium is investigating a coaxial-cavity gyrotron with the potential to produce 
2-MW CW RF output power. An industrial prototype of a CW coaxial gyrotron 
built by Thales has already been tested at Centre de Recherches en Physique des 
Plasmas (CRPP) Lausanne. Problems with the high-voltage stability did not allow 
operation of the gyrotron at nominal parameters. As a result, an RF output power 
of only 1.4 MW has been achieved, instead of the design goal of 2 MW [37].

The reason for the limitations remains unclear and is currently under 
investigation. To support the activities of this industrial prototype, studies of a 
short pulse (â¤ few milliseconds) experimental 170-GHz coaxial cavity gyrotron 
(âpreprototypeâ) are being performed at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), 
formerly the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK). The European Gyrotron 
Consortium has demonstrated short-pulse operation at 2.2 MW of this

preprototype 170-GHz gyrotron. A critical component of this tube is the quasi-
optical RF output system, which converts the TE34,19 cavity mode into a free space 
TE00 beam [37]. 
 
21.5.2   Second-Harmonic Gyrotrons 
 
Figure 21-38 shows the cross section of a second-harmonic gyrotron. The 
operating frequency was 34 GHz, the RF power output was 10-kW CW, and the 
efficiency was 40%. Because the tube operated at the second harmonic, the 
cyclotron frequency was about 17 GHz and  the magnetic field was low enough so 
that a room-temperature solenoid could be used [38].

21.5.3   Permanent Magnet Gyrotrons 
 
Calabazas Creek Research, Inc. (CCR) is developing a permanent magnet gyrotron 
for a W-band active denial, nonlethal weapon system (Figure 21-39) [39]. The 
current RF source for these systems is a 95-GHz gyrotron producing 
approximately 100 kW and using a super-conducting magnet. The cost and 
logistics issues associated with the source and magnet impose considerable 
operational and maintenance requirements. A particular disadvantage to the 
current system is the 12-hour start-up time for the magnet. This could be 
eliminated by use of a permanent magnet. 
 
Rare earth permanent magnet technology allows construction of compact 
magnets with peak fields up to 1.9 Tesla. This is sufficiently high to support a 
second harmonic interaction at 95 GHz. However, the mass of such a magnet 
would be prohibitively high so the third harmonic interaction was chosen, thereby 
reducing the field requirement to 1.2 Tesla. The magnet mass for this approach is 
890 kG.

21.6   GYRO-AMPLIFIERS 
 
The gyro-amplifiers to be discussed are indicated in Figure 21-40. These are the 
gyro-klystron, gyro-twystron, and gyro-TWT. Gyro-amplifiers are being 
developed for applications requiring phase coherence and instantaneous 
bandwidth. A primary application is radar where they are of considerable interest 
for future high-performance applications [40].  
 
Gyro-amplifiers have larger weight and volume than state-of-the-art coupled-
cavity TWTs, but they can provide significantly higher powers than the TWTs. 
The wide variety of radar applications for which gyro-amplifiers are now being 
considered are both those existing millimeter-wave radar applications and new 
radar applications previously not considered due to the absence of powerful 
amplifiers at the required frequencies.

The frequency bands in which gyro-amplifiers are expected to find important 
radar applications are primarily Ka-band (26.5â40 GHz) and W-band (75â110 
GHz). Within these bands, radars are generally designed to take advantage of the 
atmospheric windows at frequencies of approximately 35 GHz and 94 GHz.

The bandwidth requirement of the system determines the tube type: 
 
â¢ 
Gyro-klystron for < 1% bandwidth; 
â¢ 
Gyro-twystron for 1% to 2% bandwidth; 
â¢ 
Gyro-TWT for bandwidths > 2%. 
 
These devices are described in Sections 21.6.1 through 21.6.3. 
 
 
21.6.1   Gyro-Klystrons 
 
Conceptually, the only difference between the gyro-klystron and the gyrotron 
oscillator is the addition of the input cavity. The operation of a gyro-klystron is 
similar to a conventional klystron except that electron bunching occurs in the 
azimuthal direction rather than in the axial direction. In a gyro-klystron, a signal to 
be amplified is fed into an input cavity where the cyclotron bunching process is 
initiated. Then, the beam is permitted to drift while bunches form. As the beam 
passes through a second cavity, the amplified signal may be removed or the 
bunching process may be enhanced and the signal removed in a subsequent cavity. 
A sketch of a four-cavity gyro-klystron is shown in Figure 21-41 [41].

An example of a gyro-klystron is the CPI VGB-8194. This five-cavity 
amplifier operates at 93.5 to 94.5 GHz with a 3-dB bandwidth of 700 MHz. The 
peak RF output power is 100 kW and the average output power is 10 kW. The 
amplifier is available with a cryogen-free 4-tesla superconducting magnet [42]. 
 

Gyrotrons 
 
617 
 
Among other applications, the VGB-8194 gyro-klystron is the key component 
of the NRL WARLOC radar and is what made this development unique [43]. 
WARLOC is a high average power, coherent W-band (94-GHz) radar operating at 
the NRL Chesapeake Bay Detachment (CBD) site in Maryland. Developed by the 
Navy as a research radar for imaging and tracking applications, WARLOC also 
brings unprecedented sensitivity to the measurement of cloud parameters 
(including phase, morphology, and particle size and motion) at spatial resolutions 
unparalleled by contemporary radar systems.  
 
21.6.2   Gyro-Twystrons 
 
The gyro-twystron, like the conventional twystron, is a hybrid device with a 
modest bandwidth capability. It is derived from the gyro-klystron by using the 
gyro-klystron interaction in the cavities near the RF input and  by replacing the 
output cavity with  a slightly tapered waveguide section as in the gyro-TWT to be 
described in the next section. The output section is excited by the electron beam, 
which is bunched by the interaction in the klystron section. 
 
The configuration of the gyro-twystron can prevent the problem of  
breakdown at high-power levels because the RF power density in the output 
waveguide can be much smaller than in the gyro-klystron output cavity. 
 
An application for gyro-twystrons is the Haystack radar upgrade. The 
Haystack Ultra-wideband Satellite Imaging Radar (HUSIR) development is being 
conducted at the Lincoln Space Surveillance Complex by MIT Lincoln 
Laboratory. For the Haystack upgrade, it is planned that 16 CPI VGB 8193 W-
band gyro-twystrons with 1.5-GHz bandwidth  at 55-kW peak RF output and 10% 
duty will be used to cover four frequencies in the 92â100-GHz band [2]. 
 
21.6.3   Gyro-TWTs 
 
There has been substantial interest and development effort in gyro-TWTs. The 
gyro-TWT is an attractive candidate for use as the transmitter power amplifier in 
millimeter-wave radars. Gyro-TWTs are capable of a much broader bandwidth 
than gyro-klystrons. 
 
In these devices, a nonresonant RF structure is used to produce a traveling 
wave interaction. As in other gyro-devices, a spiraling electron beam immersed in 
an axial magnetic field is used. Traveling waves are launched into the interaction 
space by an input coupler. Axial phase synchronism is required between the 
traveling wave and the rotating electrons as indicated in Figure 21-42.  
 
As the electromagnetic wave and the spiraling electron beam move through 
the interaction space, the kinetic energy of the electron beam is transferred into the 
electromagnetic fields, creating RF amplification. For typical operation near the

An important problem that must be dealt with in gyro-TWT design is 
maintaining stability and preventing backward wave oscillations (BWO) in the 
interaction space. At the same time, of course, acceptable performance, including 
high overall gain, stability to local reflective oscillations, and high average power 
capability must be achieved [44].  
 
To ensure stability, the majority of this interaction space should exhibit a 
moderate amount of electromagnetic loss per unit length. This distributed loading 
approach has been shown to have superior stability characteristics compared to 
using localized lossy severs. Finally, the downstream part of the interaction space 
is completed with a short, unloaded cylindrical tunnel in which the final, highest 
powered portion of the amplification takes place. 
 
The necessity for the distributed loss was clearly illustrated by Varian in a 
program to develop a C-band gyro-TWT [45, 46]. Three tubes were built, the first 
two of which had no distributed loss. These tubes had low gain and exhibited very 
large powers emanating from the input coupler. In order to increase the stable gain 
and reduce problems with reflections, the third tube was built with distributed loss. 
Kanthal was applied to the first two-thirds of the circuit. The C-band tube is 
illustrated in Figure 21-43. This tube was basically a large scale model of a 94-
GHz TWT. The development effort for this tube was undertaken in preparation for 
the development of the 94-GHz gyro-TWT.  
 
The interaction waveguide used in the C-band tube was a circular waveguide 
operating in the TE11 mode. Two rectangular to circular waveguide input 
transitions at 90Â° to each other were used to match into the two orthogonal TE11 
modes that can exist in the circular waveguide. The output window was at the end 
of the collector. Transverse field permanent magnets deflected electrons to the 
collector wall before they could reach the window.

The tube had two gun solenoids and four main field solenoids. As indicated 
by the magnetic flux density plot, optimum results were obtained by using a 
slightly tapered field. The power output characteristics for this device are shown in 
Figure 21-44. Modulating anode pulsing was used and, at a beam voltage of 65 
kV, the power output was 120 kW at an efficiency of 26%. The 3-dB bandwidth 
was 7.25%.

In another early effort to develop a 95-GHz gyro-TWT, Varian used a Pierce 
gun and a contra-wound helical winding along the beam axis to produce the 
required hollow electron beam [34, 47]. This winding, along with a straight 
magnetic field along the axis provides a force, which is perpendicular to the beam 
axis and which rotates in azimuth with distance along the beam axis. This force 
gives the electrons a transverse velocity as they move through this section of the 
tube. A schematic drawing of the device is shown in Figure 21-45 and the power 
output is plotted in Figure 21-46. The tube demonstrated output power in excess of 
20-kW peak.

Now, CPIâs VGB-8190 gyro-TWT has demonstrated the ability to produce 2-
kW peak power (0.8 kW average) with a bandwidth of 6.5 GHz around a center 
frequency of 95.5 GHz. A gyro-TWT similar to this (8-GHz bandwidth, 500-W 
peak, >250-W average from 92â100 GHz) is used as the driver for twystrons in the 
Haystack radar [2]. 
 
A novel wideband, 140-GHz, 1-kW confocal gyro-TWT is being developed at 
MIT [48].The waveguide geometry and mode pattern used in this device are 
shown in Figure 21-47. The curved cylindrical mirror geometry consists of two 
mirrors to make up the cylindrical confocal waveguide system. The total width of 
each mirror can be adjusted in order to induce distributed diffractive loss.

Power contours for the HE06 mode and the geometry of the hollow annular 
electron beam are also shown. The electron beam interacts primarily with the 
second and fifth maxima to produce a Gaussian-like higher-order mode. Also, the 
mode spectrum is sparser than in a cylindrical waveguide and the device is suitable 
for harmonic operation. 
 
The device has demonstrated a linear gain of 34 dB at 34.7 kV and 2.7A and 
produced an output power of over 820W at 37.7 kV and 2.7A. With a slight 
change in operating point, the amplifier achieved a saturated bandwidth of over 
1.5 GHz with 570-W output power at 38.5 kV and 2.5A. The device has been

shown to be applicable to short-pulse spectroscopy. Although the experiments 
were carried out at a 2-Î¼s pulse length, pulses as short as 4 ns, which is the limit of 
the present input source, were amplified with no noticeable pulse broadening. 
These nanosecond-scale pulses were used to diagnose the system by a novel TDR 
technique. This method provided valuable insights to the nature of echoes, 
resonances, and reflections in the system, which could be pinpointed inside of the 
vacuum tube without the need to ever open the vacuum envelope. 
 
A concept for an ultrawideband distributed gyrotron traveling-wave amplifier 
for millimeter and submillimeter waves is shown in Figure 21-48 [49]. The radius 
of the waveguide in the interaction region is increased along the axis. 
Amplification occurs over ÎL, which moves along the circuit as frequency 
changes. The strength of the dc magnetic field is decreased in such a way that the 
wave cutoff frequency is kept nearly equal to the electron cyclotron frequency. 
The basic principle of operation, peak gain, and saturated efficiency have been 
analyzed. It is shown that instantaneous bandwidth over at least 2 octaves is 
theoretically possible.

21.7   TERAHERTZ GYROTRONS 
 
The magnetic field required for fundamental-frequency operation at 1 THz is nearly 
40T (400,000G). A present, this is beyond the capability of superconducting 
magnets, so pulsed magnets that are wound directly on the gyrotron are being 
used. Glyavin and Luchinin reported the generation of 50T with the basic circuit 
shown in Figure 21-49 [50]. Output powers of 5 kW at 1 THz and 0.5 kW at 1.3 
THz have been obtained with fundamental operation at a  pulse duration of 40

Other results reported in [50] are second-harmonic operation at 100-W CW at 
395 GHz, 2.2-kW CW at 300 GHz, and third-harmonic operation at 371â414 GHz 
in 10-Î¼s pulses with powers of 10â20 kW. 
 
Nusinovich et al. described a program to develop a 30â35% efficient 
670-GHz, 300-kW gyrotron pulsed with a 28-T magnetic field. Much of the work 
on this device is expected to be done by GYCOM in Russia [51]. The application 
for this gyrotron is for creating localized breakdown in air when nearby 
radioactive ionizing sources produce an increase in the density of free electrons.

22.1   BACKGROUND 
 
The problem of transmitting RF energy from the vacuum environment inside a 
tube to an external load is common to all types of microwave tubes. The number 
of possible window configurations seems to be limited only by the ingenuity of the 
designer [1, 2]. Many fairly distinct designs in coaxial lines and waveguides have 
been used successfully. All of these techniques have been highly dependent upon 
materials and vacuum seal technology. Over the last 70 years, windows have 
followed a gradual evolution from simple mica membranes in waveguides to high 
purity alumina, beryllia, sapphire, and now, diamond windows. The works of 
Churchill [3â6] provide information on high-power windows. 
 
 
22.2   COAXIAL WINDOWS 
 
In the case of coaxial windows, the mechanical design and fabrication can be 
difficult. Two vacuum seals are required (inner conductor to ceramic and outer 
conductor to ceramic). Also, at high frequencies, the center conductor in the 
ceramic becomes very small and metallization and brazing become difficult. The 
RF design of coaxial windows is relatively easy because the transmission line uses 
the TEM mode and the ceramic is a disk as shown in Figure 22-1. 
  
The impedance of a coaxial line operating in the TEM mode is given by

where Îµ is the relative dielectric constant of the media between the center and 
outer conductors. For vacuum or air where Îµ = 1, the ratio b/a = 2.3 for an 
impedance of 50â¦. The ceramic that is used for the window is nearly always 
Al2O3 or, when high thermal conductivity is required, BeO. The relative dielectric 
constant of alumina is 9.3 and so, for an impedance of 50â¦, b/a = 12.7. This 
means that the radius of the center conductor in alumina (a') must be about 20% of 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons

that in vacuum or air (a). For beryllia, the relative dielectric constant is 6.4 so the 
radius of the center conductor must be about 30% of that in vacuum or air. Figure 
22-2 shows the relative sizes of conductors for a coaxial window used in practice. 
Notice that the radius of the center conductor in the ceramic is about one-third of 
the radius in air or vacuum. It should also be noticed that the reduced diameter is 
extended a short distance from the ceramic. This is done to improve the impedance 
match.

Hughes Electron Dynamics Division has described the integral coax-to-
waveguide adapter window shown in Figure 22-3. This was used on a coupled-
cavity TWT with a waveguide input. The interface with the customers system was 
coaxial. In this case, the design was empirical. Impedance match adjustments 
could be made by varying the waveguide backwall position, the inner-conductor 
diameter, and the depth of penetration of the inner conductor in the waveguide. 
The vacuum seal was made to the outer conductor only.

22.3   WAVEGUIDE WINDOWS 
 
The simplest window consists of an inductive iris into which is sealed a capacitive 
dielectric plate. An example is shown in Figure 22-4. The impedance is adjusted 
so that it is resonant and the shunt admittance is made zero at the band center. The 
frequency at which the window appears to be matched can be adjusted by 
changing the dielectric thickness or diameter. The window can be matched over a 
broader band by making the inductive hole (and the dielectric) elliptical, but still 
the design has restricted bandwidth. This design can be refined as shown in Figure 
22-5 by extending the support for the window and using chokes to isolate the 
support for the window. Iris windows are limited on peak power handling 
capability (for example, about 1 MW at 3 GHz and less at higher frequencies).

The two most generally used window designs suitable for medium- and high-
power tubes consist of either a rectangular ceramic block in the output waveguide, 
or a circular ceramic disk (sometimes referred to as a poker chip) in a section of 
round waveguide, which is then adapted to rectangular waveguides on both ends. 
The window thickness is almost always one-half wavelength or less (although the 
thickness is somewhat arbitrary, since almost any configuration can be designed 
for good transmission). The most important factors are the methods of design 
used, the average and peak power handling capabilities, the bandwidth available, 
the elimination of unwanted resonances, and the basic technology of manufacture. 
 
The block window is not used as often as the disk window, but it is easier to 
design and is useful in illustrating some of the characteristics and problems in 
design and use. The most common block window is half a wavelength thick and 
fills the entire cross section of the waveguide. These windows are well matched at 
the resonant frequency and are suitable for narrow bandwidths without 
modification (see Figure 22-6). If irises or other matching elements are added, the 
window can be made into a filter with a bandwidth of 10% to 20%. It is mainly a 
high-power window, particularly suitable for high average power. The 
transmission loss is low, on the order of 0.2%, and, because it is a filter, the 
reflection from it is essentially reactive. A VSWR plot for one of these windows is 
shown in Figure 22-7. The electrical design is straightforward and can easily be 
adapted to computer approaches where the matching elements are determined 
automatically for a given bandwidth [7]. 
 
Probably the most severe problem for block windows is âghost modes.â 
Forrer and Jaynes described a method for determining these resonances, which 
arise from stored energy in higher-order waveguide modes inside the dielectric [8]. 
These modes are beyond cutoff in the waveguide and behave as high-Q cavities 
that are loosely coupled to the dominant propagating mode. These resonances, 
although barely visible on a VSWR plot, are hazardous for high-power operation 
because of the possibility of high-power absorption and subsequent failure of the 
window at ghost-mode frequencies.

For a standard window configuration, using alumina ceramic, more than 10 
such resonances, irregularly spaced, will be present in the ordinary passband of the 
waveguide. The choice of the center frequency of the window allows some 
adjustment of these resonant frequencies. A more powerful method is the shaping 
of the window cross section. This usually entails the reduction of window height, 
and sometimes the width, somewhat below those in the waveguide. This may be 
done by either a small abrupt step or a gradual taper. A small adjustment of the 
window aspect ratio will allow up to 15% mode-free bandwidth. 
 
These windows have been used in a great variety of high-power tubes. The 
highest-power examples are X-band, CW power of 263 kW in a resonant-ring 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons

experiment, and 125 kW in the VA-949AM. The dielectric window material for 
both was beryllia because of its high thermal conductivity. For lower-power tubes, 
alumina ceramics are adequate. 
 
The most widely used window configuration is the disk. It consists of a flat 
disk in a section of circular waveguide which is adapted on both sides to 
rectangular waveguide. The transition from round to rectangular waveguides, 
which may be either abrupt or gradual, often incorporates matching elements. 
Although all thicknesses of the ceramic are possible, almost all of these windows 
belong to one of two categories. 
 
 
1. The ceramic is made as thin as mechanical stresses and the fear of 
electrical breakdown will allow (about one-tenth of a wavelength). 
 
2. The window is made self-resonant (a half-wave long at the center fre-
quency).  
 
 
Disk windows are substantially easier to build than rectangular windows. 
However, trapped-mode resonances are a problem. These resonances are due to 
modes that propagate in the round part of a waveguide, but are cut off at the 
transitions to the rectangular waveguides. In addition, ghost modes may also be 
present in the ceramic. Their density increases with the thickness of the ceramic. 
Since a thicker dielectric is usually used in round than in rectangular windows, the 
ghost-mode population in round windows is usually higher than in rectangular 
windows. 
 
The simplest and most commonly used form of the disk window is a thin 
ceramic in a short circular waveguide section joined abruptly to the rectangular 
waveguides. This window, which in its basic form was patented by Symons [9], is 
shown in Figure 22-8. It is an easy window to make and has been used for tubes at 
all power levels. It can be made exceptionally broadband if trapped modes can be 
tolerated as is the case in many low- and medium-power tubes. The VSWR of a 
broadbanded version of this window is shown in Figure 22-9. Notice that the 
trapped-mode population is relatively high, although only one of the modes 
couples very strongly to the propagating wave. By proper adjustment of all 
dimensions, these windows can be made completely mode-free in a 15% to 20% 
bandwidth. 
 
Since most output windows rely on cooling at the edge only, the disk window 
is inferior to the rectangular window for average power because of the longer heat 
path to the periphery. Nevertheless, by taking advantage of extremely low-loss 
materials, such as synthetic sapphire, very high average powers have been realized 
in these windows. The thin-disk window is also suitable for high peak power. One 
of its many applications was in the 25-MW peak power S-band klystron for the 
Stanford linear accelerator [10].

Where a large bandwidth is not necessary, an excellent high-power window is 
the half-wave-thick disk type shown in Figure 22-10. Its bandwidth is generally 
limited by the ghost-mode resonances to about 5%. An example for such a 
window is its application for a 500-kW CW low S-band tube [11]. This window 
uses a beryllia ceramic. 
 
Although many windows are made of alumina, the very highest powers 
(average or continuous) obtained have been with beryllia, which has a very high 
thermal conductivity, sapphire, which is extremely low-loss and has high strength, 
or CVD diamond. The capabilities of disk windows are, perhaps, best described by 
Goldfinger [12]. His results indicated that powers as high as 1-MW average at X-
band through a thin-disk sapphire window are possible. For gyrotrons, face-cooled 
double disk sapphire windows as shown in Figure 22-11 can be used at power 
levels of 0.3â0.4 MW [13].

During the past two decades, there has been strong interest in the development 
of diamond windows [14]. Reasons for this interest are evident from some of the 
information given in Table 22.1 where the properties of chemical vapor deposited 
(CVD) diamond are compared with other window materials. Properties of natural 
diamond are also given. Notice that its properties are far superior to the other 
window materials. While the properties of CVD diamond are not equal to those of 
natural diamond, CVD diamond can be made in the form of a window, whereas it 
would virtually impossible to use natural diamond for that purpose. 
 
The properties of CVD diamond are far more favorable for use in high-power 
tubes than either BeO or sapphire. The relatively low dielectric constant of CVD 
diamond allows wider bandwidth designs than either BeO of sapphire. The low-
loss tangent coupled with the extremely high thermal conductivity make it an 
excellent material for high-power applications. 
 
As an example of the improved thermal performance of CVD diamond 
compared to BeO, [14] gives a comparison of calculations of the temperature rise 
in the center of Ku-band windows made of the two materials. The power 
transmitted through the windows was 10 kW. The calculation for the BeO window 
showed 19W of loss and a 3.7Â°C gradient between the center and the edge of the 
window. For the CVD diamond, the loss was only 4.71W and the temperature 
gradient was 0.546Â°C. The temperature gradient in the CVD diamond was a factor 
of 6.7 below that in BeO.

22.4   SCALING OF WINDOWS 
 
The most common failure mode of a window is fracture due to thermal stresses. 
As a result, the limitation of thermal stresses is one of the most important factors 
in window design. The average power capability of a window can be scaled to 
another frequency with reasonable accuracy. If the loss tangent and dielectric 
constant are held constant and the size of the window is scaled directly with 
wavelength, the average power handling capability is inversely proportional to 
frequency. 
 
At a fixed frequency, the power handling capability is virtually insensitive to 
the window cross-section dimensions. This is because, even though dissipation 
density is decreased for a larger window, a longer path for the heat flux is created. 
This results in essentially the same maximum temperature at the center of the 
window regardless of the window size. As a result, there is no advantage from an 
average-power standpoint in going to a very large window. However, problems 
associated with operation at high peak-power levels, such as breakdown, will be 
alleviated in a larger window.

Noise 
 
 
There are many sources of noise in a microwave tube. Some are unavoidable, but 
most can be minimized or eliminated through proper design and construction. In 
this chapter, an attempt has been made to provide discussions of important noise 
sources and techniques that can be used to minimize their effects. The discussions 
center on noise in linear-beam tubes where noise phenomena are well understood. 
Noise phenomena in crossed-field devices are still not understood. The chapter 
starts with a description of thermal agitation noise, which is the noise basis against 
which all other noise is compared, and a review of the definitions of noise figure. 
The chapter ends with a discussion of the minimum noise figure that is obtainable 
in a beam-type device. 
 
 
23.1   THERMAL AGITATION NOISE 
 
Thermal agitation noise results from the minute voltage generated by the random 
motion of free electrons in conductors. The voltage produced by thermal agitation 
has energy distributed throughout the entire frequency spectrum. In the frequency 
band f2 â f1, the effective voltage produced, e, is given by

Thermal agitation noise sets the ultimate limit to the smallest signal that can 
be amplified without being lost in a background of noise. For example, for R = 1/2 
Mâ¦, T = 300K, and B = 5 kHz, the effective noise voltage, e, is 6.4 Î¼V. Signal 
amplitudes on the order of this voltage level (6.4 Î¼V) or smaller would be distorted

23.3   OVERVIEW OF NOISE PHENOMENA 
 
There are three unavoidable sources of noise in a microwave tube: 
 
 
â¢ 
Shot noise; 
 
â¢ 
Velocity noise; 
 
â¢ 
Thermal agitation noise. 
 
 
Shot noise results from the discrete nature of the electron and the fact that 
electron emission is a random process. Velocity noise occurs because of the wide 
distribution (Maxwellian) in velocities of electrons emitted by the hot cathode. 
This noise is often referred to as Rack velocity noise, named after A. J. Rack, who 
first described a technique for analyzing the effects of this noise. Thermal agitation 
noise is present because the RF circuit, which has loss, is normally at room 
temperature or above. 
 
In addition to these three unavoidable noise sources, there are many other 
sources of noise that depend largely on some aspect of design and construction. 
Most of these can be made insignificant through the use of careful design and 
construction procedures. Some of these noise sources result from: 
 
 
â¢ 
Partition effect; 
 
â¢ 
Flicker effect; 
 
â¢ 
Collision ionization; 
 
â¢ 
Secondary and reflected electrons; 
 
â¢ 
Lens effects; 
 
â¢ 
Noise growth; 
 
â¢ 
Poor insulation; 
 
â¢ 
Varying insulator charges; 
 
â¢ 
Microphonics resulting from vibration; 
 
â¢ 
Multipactor; 
 
â¢ 
Power-supply induced noise, such as hum.

The most significant noises in a linear-beam tube are usually those produced 
by the cathode (shot and velocity). These noises are modified in significant ways 
as the electron beam travels through the electron gun and into the RF region of the 
tube. 
 
An extremely important characteristic of noise impressed on an electron beam 
is that noise propagates like any other RF signal on the beam. That is, noise travels 
as fast and slow space charge waves. The two sources that produce these waves 
are the shot effect current and the velocity noise. In the general case, the two 
sources are assumed to be uncorrelated, and so each source produces fast and slow 
waves. As these waves propagate along the beam, noise current and velocity 
standing waves are independently produced. 
 
In low-power, low-noise TWTs, some degree of correlation between the 
current and velocity noise sources is produced with a special low velocity drift 
region in the electron gun. Then care is taken in accelerating the electron beam in 
the gun so that the amplitudes of the standing waves that develop are minimized. 
The design of the acceleration region in the gun is analogous to the design of an 
impedance matching section of a transmission line. Finally, as the beam leaves the 
gun, the axial position of the entrance of the beam into the helix is adjusted (by 
properly positioning the helix) to coincide with a noise minimum. 
 
With no correlation between current and velocity noise, the minimum noise 
figure for a TWT is predicted to be 6.5 dB. With correlation (produced by the low 
velocity drift region in the gun) noise figures below 3 dB have been achieved. It 
has also been found that the use of a large axial magnetic field in the acceleration 
region of the gun and in the input section of the RF structure further inhibits noise. 
With large magnetic fields in these regions, noise figures as low as 1 dB have been 
achieved and it has been predicted that, with additional refinements, a noise figure 
of 0 dB could be approached. 
 
Some of the discussions in this chapter relate primarily to low power, low 
noise TWTs that are no longer used in modern systems. However, the noise 
phenomena in these TWTs exist, to some extent, in all TWTs so it is of value to 
discuss them. 
 
 
23.4   NOISE IN ELECTRON GUNS 
 
For a discussion of noise properties, it is convenient to divide the electron gun into 
four regions as shown in Figure 23-1. The unavoidable sources of noise at the 
cathode surface (Region I) are velocity noise as described by Rack and shot noise. 
There may also be flicker noise but this is a low frequency noise that is negligible 
at microwave frequencies. Flicker noise will be discussed at the end of this 
section.

Because of the initial emission velocities of the electrons, the potential of the 
space charge cloud (Region II) near the cathode surface is slightly below cathode 
potential. Low velocity electrons are returned to the cathode by this potential 
minimum. The amount by which the potential is depressed fluctuates as the 
cathode current fluctuates (shot effect). Thus, the number of electrons returned to 
the cathode fluctuates with time and this, in turn, changes (reduces at low 
microwave frequencies) the shot noise current passing the potential minimum. 
Additional noise may be introduced at the potential minimum by ions and reflected 
electrons from the collector. It turns out that the velocity distribution of the 
electrons is unaffected by the potential minimum. 
 
Region III exists in low-noise TWTs through careful design of the cathode 
configuration and the electrodes near the cathode. In the gun of a high-power TWT 
this region, if it exists at all, is so short that it has negligible effect on noise 
performance. 
 
In low-noise TWTs, electrons drift at low velocities (energy <1 eV) for an 
extended distance in Region III. Noise current and velocity become correlated to 
some degree, and this reduces noise figure by about 3 dB. The reason for this 
correlation is not clear. 
 
When the electron beam emerges from Region III and is accelerated in Region 
IV, space charge waves are launched and a standing wave pattern is produced. As 
is the case in an RF transmission line, a sudden change in impedance produces an 
increase in the standing wave ratio. In a low-noise TWT, an increase in the 
standing wave ratio results in an increase in noise figure. To avoid this problem, 
several electrodes are used in Region IV to control the rate of voltage rise (and the 
rate of impedance change). In high-power microwave tubes, the function of the 
electron gun is to produce a well-focused high-perveance beam and no attempt is 
made to control the rate of impedance change.

As the electron beam emerges from the electron gun into Region V, care is 
taken in low-noise tubes to position the entrance of the RF structure at the noise 
minimum. A strong magnetic field in Regions IV and V has been found to reduce 
noise. The phenomena occurring in Regions IâIV are described in Sections 23.5 to 
23.7. 
 
 
23.5   NOISE GENERATION AT THE CATHODE 
 
23.5.1   Shot Noise 
 
Shot noise [1] results from the random emission of electrons from the cathode. The 
randomly emitted electrons are a component of the noise current in the electron 
beam. This noise current is coupled to nearby RF circuits as discussed in Chapter 8 
and illustrated in Figure 23-2. The circuit current can be found from a Fourier 
analysis of the induced current pulses. The mean square of the current fluctuations, 
i 2, depends only on emitted current, Io, and bandwidth, B, as follows:

The multivelocity flow of electrons from the cathode that results from the 
Maxwellian velocity distribution is difficult, if not impossible, to treat analytically. 
Rack [2] showed that, at low frequencies, this multivelocity flow can be replaced 
by a single-velocity flow with the same mean square fluctuation in velocity, which

We will discuss in Section 23.8.1 how Peterson and Pierce used the Rack 
velocity expression to predict noise behavior at microwave frequencies. Cutler and 
Quate found surprisingly good experimental agreement with the Pierce prediction.  
 
23.5.3   Other Noise Generation Mechanisms 
 
At low frequencies, two other (other than shot and velocity) noise generation 
mechanisms occur. These are hum produced by the filament and flicker noise. The 
reason for the hum was discussed in Chapter 5 on thermionic cathodes. Magnetic 
flux from the filament linking through the cathode surface disturbs the trajectories 
of electrons and results in modulation of the beam shape.

The flicker effect produces a large amount of noise over and above shot noise. 
Figure 23-4 contains representative plots of flicker noise for directly and indirectly 
heated cathodes [3]. Note that flicker noise can be orders of magnitude above shot 
noise. Note also that flicker noise drops rapidly as frequency is increased. There 
appear to be many possible causes for flicker noise [4], depending on the type of 
cathode being used. For dispenser cathodes of the types normally used in TWTs, 
the original theory of flicker noise proposed by Schottky may apply.  
 
Schottky attributed the flicker effect to foreign atoms arriving and departing 
from the cathode surface at random. For temperature-limited cathodes, he 
predicted that the mean square noise current should be proportional to the square 
of emission current density and, at high frequencies, inversely proportional to the 
square of frequency. Flicker noise was predicted to be even more strongly 
suppressed by space charge than shot noise. 
 
A dispenser cathode consists of a monoatomic layer of barium on oxygen on 
the substrate metal (tungsten in a B cathode, osmium in an M cathode, and so 
forth). During operation of the cathode, there is continual evaporation of atoms 
from the surface and migration of additional atoms from the tungsten substrate to 
the surface. The evaporation of atoms from the surface is a random thermal 
process that produces fluctuations in work function and, thereby, in emission 
current. These fluctuations are thought to be the primary source of flicker noise in 
a dispenser cathode.

23.6   THE SPACE CHARGE MINIMUM REGION 
 
The electron emission velocities were ignored when we examined space charge 
limited flow. Emission velocities are included in the analysis of noise behavior. 
Because of these velocities, there is a small depression in the potential near the 
cathode surface. This depression, which is indicated in Figure 23-5, reflects low 
energy (< ~0.2 eV) electrons and returns them to the cathode. At the potential 
minimum, the energies of all other electrons are reduced by ~0.2 eV.

Figure 23-5   Initial emission velocities of electrons result in depression of potential near 
the cathode. 
 
 
Figure 23-6 shows plots of electron positions as functions of time [5]. Each 
plot also shows the distance from the cathode of an electron at time t and the time 
at which the electron must have left the cathode surface (depending on its initial 
velocity) to arrive at that position. Note that the time required for electrons to 
travel to the potential minimum (located at 0.0075 mm) is only ~0.02 ns. 
 
23.6.1   Rack Noise Invariance 
 
Because the initial velocity distribution is Maxwellian and because the velocities 
of all electrons that reach the potential minimum are reduced by the same amount, 
the velocity distribution at the potential minimum is Maxwellian. Figure 23-7 
shows velocity distributions at the cathode surface and at the potential minimum. 
 
23.6.2   Shot Noise Reduction 
 
Because emission is random (shot effect), the potential minimum produced by the 
electrons fluctuates with time. The increase in depression produced by a burst of 
electrons is shown in Figure 23-8. The additional depression increases the number 
of reflected electrons, thereby reducing the number of electrons in the burst that 
pass the minimum. As a result, the potential minimum reduces the shot noise 
current. The amount of reduction depends on frequency and approaches 100% at 
low frequencies. Fluctuations in the potential minimum do not change the average 
velocity or the velocity distribution of the electrons.

At frequencies approaching the electron plasma frequency, a resonance 
condition exists that enhances shot noise. One explanation for this resonance may 
be understood with the aid of Figure 23-9 [6]. The equivalent circuit for the 
cathode-to-potential-minimum region may be thought of as the capacitance of this 
region in parallel with an inductance that represents the inertial effect of the space 
charge cloud at the minimum. The quantity, G, is the conductance of the retarding 
field diode (cathode to potential minimum). The plasma frequency at the potential 
minimum for the current densities used in some low noise TWTs is in the low 
microwave frequency range (3â4 GHz).

Predictions of the shot noise reduction factor Î2 (the amount by which the 
shot current is reduced) are shown in Figure 23-10. For these predictions, the ratio 
of emitted current, Is, to the current passing the potential minimum, Io, was 5. (The 
remainder of the current consisted of low-velocity electrons that were reflected by 
the potential minimum and returned to the cathode.) For frequencies near the 
plasma frequency, shot noise current is increased by a factor of about 2. 
 
23.6.3   Other Noise Effects 
 
Charged particles other than electrons from the cathode will also affect the 
potential minimum. For example, positive ions generated in or near the electron 
gun will travel toward the cathode. As they pass through the potential minimum 
they cause the voltage to rise, so additional current from the cathode can pass the 
minimum region. Since the ion production process is random, the fluctuations of 
the potential minimum that they produce are random and the resulting current 
fluctuations are random.

Another source of charge that can affect the potential minimum is high- 
velocity secondary electrons, primarily from the collector. These electrons are 
guided through the tube in the reverse direction by the magnetic focusing field. If 
their interaction with the RF fields is such that they gain (or at least do not lose) 
energy, they will be able to reach the potential minimum region. The secondary 
emission process is a noisy process and so secondary electrons in the potential 
minimum region produce random fluctuations of the potential minimum, which, in 
turn, produce an additional component of noise modulation on the emission 
current passing the potential minimum. 
 
Finally, it is noted that there is evidence that noiselike fluctuations of the 
space charge cloud in the potential minimum region may occur. These fluctuations 
occur on a large scale in the vircator (virtual cathode oscillator). In this device a 
dense beam of electrons is used to produce a fluctuating potential minimum. 
Reasonably efficient conversion of beam energy to generally noisy RF power 
takes place. 
 
 
23.7   LOW-VELOCITY CORRELATION REGION 
 
The biggest breakthrough on low-noise tubes was made by Currie [7] when the 
possibility of producing correlation between shot current and velocity noise was 
made apparent. Currieâs low noise electron gun is shown in Figure 23-11. The 
cathode was an annulus surrounded by an electrode, called the profile-shaping 
electrode. In Currieâs early experiments, there was also a portion of the profile 
shaping electrode in the center of the annular cathode. This was later shown to not 
be needed. Anode 1, which played an important role in shaping the potential 

Noise 
 
651 
profiles near the cathode, contained an annular opening through which the hollow 
beam from the cathode could pass. Anodes 2, 3, and 4 were used to provide the 
voltages for the desired impedance transformation to minimize the standing wave 
ratio of the of the space charge waves (to be described next).

The excess noise (noise produced by the beam) with beam conditions adjusted 
for minimum beam noisiness is shown in Figure 23-12. By comparison, the 
minimum excess noise predicted by theory with no correlation is shown by the 
dashed line. The noise figure for the TWT at 2.54 GHz was 3.6 dB. Noise figures 
as low as 2.9 dB were obtained. 
 
The potential profiles in the cathode region when voltages were adjusted for 
near-optimum conditions are shown in Figure 23-13. The electric fields near the 
cathode were such that most of the electron emission was from the edges of the 
cathode. A strong axial magnetic field was used to form the electrons into a very 
thin hollow beam. 
 
From Figure 23-13, it is seen that after the electrons left the region near the 
edge of the cathode and moved toward the anode, they drifted through a region of 
very slowly varying potentials. Thus, the situation created by Currie in his electron 
gun forced the electrons to drift for a considerable distance at a low average 
velocity that was comparable to the noise velocities of the electrons. As a result of 
this multivelocity flow, the basic noise quantities in the beam were transformed 
and some degree of correlation between noise current and velocity was achieved. 
The physical mechanism(s) for this transformation have not been described.

23.8   HIGH-VOLTAGE ACCELERATION REGION 
 
To understand the rational for the design of the high voltage acceleration region in 
a low-noise TWT, it is necessary to understand the nature of the noise space 
charge waves that propagate on the beam. In this section, we will first discuss the 
propagation of noise space charge waves and then will discuss the impedance 
transformation in an electron gun necessary to avoid large noise standing wave 
ratios. At the end of this section, a discussion of lens effects on noise is included. 
Lens effects cause radial components of noise to be converted to axial noise and 
can thereby significantly increase the noise figure of a TWT.  
    
23.8.1   Noise Space Charge Waves 
 
The propagation of noise as fast and slow space charge waves was predicted by 
Pierce [8] and by Peterson [9]. They carried out analyses of the noise resulting in 
an electron beam after acceleration of the electrons in the gun. They used the 
equations of Llewellyn and Peterson [10] for a space charge limited diode. We will 
not reproduce the Llewellyn-Peterson equations here, but will point out that two of 
the initial conditions for these equations are the noise current and velocity at the 
potential minimum. Because the dc velocity of the electrons is zero at the potential 
minimum, the equations predict that the effect of shot noise current vanishes. This 
is equivalent to using a shot-noise reduction factor of 0, which, in turn, is 
equivalent to assuming that fluctuations of the potential minimum produced by the 
shot current completely eliminate shot noise current beyond the potential 
minimum. Thus, only Rack velocity noise was used to predict noise in an electron 
beam. 
 
During acceleration of the electrons in the gun, some of the Rack velocity 
fluctuations result in current noise, and so both current and velocity noise exist in 
the electron beam. Pierce used the noise current and velocity at the exit from the 
gun as input conditions to a TWT and used his TWT theory to predict fast and 
slow noise space charge waves on an electron beam. 
 
The theories of Peterson and Pierce (and of Rack) met with considerable 
skepticism. However, the December 1950 issue of Physical Review [11] published 
C. C. Cutler and C. F. Quateâs paper âExperimental Verification of Space Charge 
and Transit Time Reduction of Noise in Electron Beams.â The noise-measuring 
apparatus used by Cutler and Quate is shown in Figure 23-14. A cavity was used 
to detect a portion of the noise current in the electron beam. A shutter could be 
moved across the beam to investigate partition current (to be discussed later in this 
chapter). 
 
The key result of the Cutler-Quate experiment is shown in Figure 23-15. 
Measured noise power was compared with the predictions of Pierce. The existence 
of noise space charge waves was clearly verified. In addition, the variation of the 
position of the minimum with voltage and with the transit angle of the electrons in 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
654 
the gun agreed with the theoretical prediction. The reason that the position of the 
minimum differs from the predicted minimum by 0.4 in was thought to be that 
calculations were based on an infinite plane diode configuration rather than a 
cylindrical beam configuration in the gun.

The absolute values of the noise levels in Figure 23-16 were determined by 
comparing them with the temperature-limited shot noise. This was done by 
reducing the cathode temperature and measuring the noise power as a function of 
beam current as shown in Figure 23-16. The slope of the curve at low beam 
currents shows the shot noise power to be proportional to current as expected 
(23-12). At larger beam currents, the noise power was reduced by space charge. 
The greatest total reduction of noise power occurred at the first minimum and was 
20 dB below the shot noise level.

23.8.2   Impedance Transformation for Low-Noise Tubes 
 
The electron beam acts as a transmission line to carry space charge waves 
launched by shot current and Rack velocity noise generators in the potential 
minimum region. From the shot current source, fast and slow current waves 
emerge and produce a current standing wave. Associated with this current wave is 
a velocity standing wave that is displaced one quarter of a plasma wavelength 
from the current wave. 
 
The Rack velocity noise generator produces fast and slow velocity waves that 
form a velocity standing wave. Associated with this velocity wave is a current 
standing wave that is displaced one quarter of a plasma wavelength from the 
velocity wave. These standing waves produced by the velocity generator are 
shown for a space charge limited planar diode in Figure 23-17 [12]. Velocity and 
current waves for two space charge conditions are shown. For a high space charge 
a velocity minimum and current maximum occur near the potential minimum 
(where the relative distance through the diode is zero). Subsequently, as the 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
656 
electrons are accelerated through the diode, the noise velocity wave grows and the 
noise current wave decreases. For the low space charge condition, the velocity 
minimum and noise current maximum occur near the anode.

The two current standing waves (one from the shot noise current source and 
the other from the Rack velocity noise source) are separated by a one-quarter 
plasma wavelength (assuming no correlation). As a result, the current distributions 
along these two waves at the exit from the gun are as shown in Figure 23-18. Each 
of these waves contributes to the noise figure of a TWT. Thus, in the design of a 
low noise TWT, it is necessary to: 
 
 
1. Control the amplitudes of the standing waves; 
 
2. Locate the entrance to the helix at a position that minimizes the noise 
induced by the two waves. 
 
 
The amplitudes of the standing waves in the electron gun are governed by the 
impedance of the electron beam. This impedance is very low at the potential 
minimum where the electron velocity is low. As the beam is accelerated and the 
velocity increases, the impedance increases (see Figure 23-18). The impedance at 
the input to the helix may be over two orders of magnitude greater than the 
impedance at the potential minimum.

To control the current standing waves so that minimum noise is introduced in 
the RF section, it is necessary to avoid rapid changes in beam impedance. This 
may be accomplished with an impedance transformer like that shown in Figure 
23-19 [6]. Several electrodes are used in the electron gun to control the rate of 
acceleration of the beam and, thereby, to control its impedance. In the example 
shown in Figure 23-19, the impedance variation as a function of distance from the 
potential minimum to the helix is nearly exponential. This is analogous to the 
situation in acoustics or RF transmission lines, where an exponential variation in 
impedance is used to match a low impedance source to a high impedance load. 
 
23.8.3   Lens Effects 
 
The transverse and axial velocities of electrons emitted from a thermionic cathode 
are assumed to be the same. In a low-noise gun, as electrons are accelerated, the 
axial velocity fluctuations decrease (see the low space charge curve in Figure 
23-17, for example). However, the transverse components of velocity are not 
appreciably affected. Thus, after acceleration, the transverse velocity components 
are much larger than the axial components. 
 
As electrons pass through a lens, their transverse and axial velocities are 
altered. If, as the electrons enter the lens, the fluctuations in their transverse 
velocities are larger that those in the axial velocities, then the axial velocity 
fluctuations are increased by the lens. This was proven theoretically and 
experimentally by Knechtli [13].

The situation illustrated in Figure 23-20 will help in providing a qualitative 
understanding of the effect of a lens on transverse velocities. The trajectories of 
three electrons with different transverse velocities are shown. To simplify the 
illustration, it is assumed that the electrons have no axial velocity fluctuations 
when entering the lens and that they all pass some plane, zo, at the same time. 
 
The electrons all pass through the lens at the same time and the trajectory of 
each is deflected through an angle, Ï. At some later time, the electrons arrive at 
positions 1, 2 and 3, which are separated in the axial direction. For this to happen, 
the electrons must have different axial velocities. Thus, in passing through the 
lens, transverse velocity components have been converted to axial velocity 
components. Thus, it is clear that discontinuities in accelerating or decelerating 
voltage increase beam noisiness (as long as the transverse velocity fluctuations are 
larger than the axial ones), and so these discontinuities, which act as electrostatic 
lenses, should be avoided in low-noise TWTs.

23.9   RF SECTION NOISE PHENOMENA 
 
23.9.1   Circuit Loss 
 
There are two effects of circuit loss on the noise figure. The smaller of the two is 
the thermal agitation noise that is generated by the resistance of the helix. The 
larger affect occurs because the noise figure depends on the gain of a TWT and 
gain, in turn, is affected by circuit loss. The affect of circuit loss on the noise 
figure amounts to, at most, a few decibels as is shown in [14] and is important in 
low-noise TWTs. As an example of the effect of helix material on the loss and 
noise figure, assume that the Pierce loss parameter, d, is 0.35 and so, from Figure 
23-21, the contribution to the noise figure is about 2.3 dB. Compared with 
tungsten, if copper with an excellent surface finish was used for the helix, the 
value of d would drop to about 0.2 and the improvement in the noise figure would 
be 0.9 dB. 
 
23.9.2   Partition Noise 
 
Partition noise arises because transverse components of thermal velocity cause 
fluctuations in the current intercepted by electrodes other than the collector. 
Transverse components of velocity may induce electron motion in a helix and 
produce a noise analogous to partition current even though no electrons actually 
strike the helix. A similar effect can occur in the grid cathode region, where space 
charge fluctuations induce grid signals. The noise added to the beam by partition 
current equals the shot noise contained in an equal amount of temperature-limited 
current [8, 15]. Also, the partition current adds a fully random velocity component 
to the beam [15].

In the experiments of Cutler and Quate [11], a shutter was used (see Figure 
23-14) to intercept a small fraction of the beam current and, thus, control the 
partition current. The resulting noise data given in Figure 23-22 show a direct 
correlation between noise power and partition current. 
 
23.9.3   Secondary Electron Interactions 
 
The electron beam striking the collector generates a large number of slow 
secondary electrons and a small percentage of fast secondaries (often referred to as 
reflected electrons) that have energies nearly equal to the incident electron energy. 
The secondary electron current contains noise of the primary beam plus shot noise 
from the secondary emission process. If a portion of the secondary current escapes 
from the collector, it can introduce noise on the RF circuit through interception or 
by interacting with reverse traveling waves on the RF circuit. This noise is 
amplified and, at the input of the RF circuit, may be partially reflected and thus 
contribute to the total noise output. 
 
In multistage depressed collectors, great care is taken to minimize the 
generation of secondary electrons and to prevent their escape from the collector. 
Still, some secondaries are generated and those that do leave the collector have a 
wide range of energies. This is because those electrons were generated from 
electrodes at depressed potentials. Thus, those electrons are accelerated as they 
travel toward the exit from the collector (and into the interaction region). The 
problem of noise generation by secondaries from collectors is greatly reduced with 
properly designed multistage depressed collectors.

23.9.4   Noise Growth 
 
Measurements of noise on a beam usually show a standing wave pattern like that 
found by Cutler and Quate [11]. Sometimes, however, noise increases very rapidly 
up to very large saturation values, as shown in Figure 23-23 [6]. The results of 
measurements by Gilmour [16] show (see Figure 23-24) that a large increase in 
peak velocity of the electrons may also occur. Voltage equivalents of electron 
velocities ~100V above the dc beam voltage were observed. In both Peterâs and 
Gilmourâs experiments, the electron gun was shielded and the magnetic field at the 
cathode was near zero. In measurements made at MIT [17] an auxiliary magnetic 
field was applied to the cathode region. The growing noise could be eliminated by 
making the auxiliary field have the same direction as the axial component of the 
main focusing field at the cathode. The opposite polarity of the auxiliary field 
increased the noise. As of yet, no theory adequately explains the noise growth 
phenomena. Scalloped beam amplification has been proposed but the variation of 
noise growth with the magnetic field that is predicted is far different from the 
measured results. 
 
23.9.5   Magnetic Noise Suppression 
 
A high magnetic field applied to the helix input region of a low-noise TWT can 
reduce the noise figure to a very low value. For example, in [18], Hammer and 
Thomas reported TWT noise figures of 1.0 dB at S-band. The equivalent beam 
noise temperature was only 57K, and the ratio of this noise temperature to room 
temperature was 0.19.

In a subsequent paper [19], Hammer and Wen showed that the beam noise 
temperature varied inversely with the magnetic field as shown in Figure 23-25. 
They stated that these results were obtained after some degradation in noise 
performance. Before degradation, the straight line through the data passed through 
the origin, indicating a beam noise temperature of 0K and a noise figure of 0 dB. 
The Hammer and Wen study indicated that the magnetic field suppresses 
transverse noise fluctuations that couple to the helix. The transverse fluctuations 
originate in the current emitted from a thermionic cathode and are statistically 
independent of the axial fluctuations.

23.10   OTHER NOISE SOURCES 
 
There are several other sources of noise in a microwave tube. Some of these are 
the following: 
 
 
1. One or more grids are often used in an electron gun to control current. 
Some interception of emitted current occurs, and this introduces partition 
noise. In addition, field distortions occur near the grid, and these 
introduce transverse velocity components to electron trajectories. The 
overall affect of the grid is to raise the apparent temperature of the 
cathode. In one report in which a computer code was used to simulate a 
shadow gridded gun with a fictitious cathode temperature, the best 
correlation between computed and measured beam interception was 
obtained with an apparent cathode temperature of 10,750K. 
 
2. Hum results from inadequate filtering of power supply voltages and can 
result in RF modulation at power frequencies and their harmonics. This 
will be discussed further in Chapter 24. The hum produced by an ac 
filament magnetic field that links the cathode surface was discussed 
previously in this chapter.

664 
 
3. Faulty insulation can result in breakdown, corona, or partial discharges 
that produce fluctuations in voltages and modulation of the RF signal. 
 
4. Multipactor is a form of RF vacuum breakdown that occurs across 
vacuum gaps or on insulator surfaces. Noiselike impedance fluctuations 
occur that modulate the RF signal. 
 
5. Time-varying charge accumulations on insulator surfaces, such as the 
support rods for the helix, can modulate the RF signal. 
 
6. Movement of the cathode, grid, helix, and so forth as the result of shock 
and vibration produces modulation of the RF signal. 
 
7. âGas noiseâ is generated by ions that produce fluctuations of the potential 
minimum at the cathode surface and, thereby, produce noise. In addition, 
ions can produce oscillations, beam compression and reduced power 
output, RF phase shift and phase noise and reduced cathode activity, 
which, in turn, results in patchy emission and increased flicker and shot 
noise. 
 
 
23.11   MINIMUM NOISE FIGURE OF A TWT 
 
An expression for the minimum noise figure of a TWT has been derived by several 
researchers [20â22] with the assumption that the noise at the potential minimum is 
uncorrelated shot noise current and Rack velocity noise. With the additional 
assumptions that the gain is high and that circuit losses are negligible, the 
minimum noise figure is

(23-17) 
where Tc is the cathode temperature and To is room temperature. For typical 
cathode temperatures, Fmin is in the range of 6.4 to 7.3 dB. This is the minimum 
noise figure if noise reduction (but not correlation) is provided to minimize noise 
figure. When helix losses are considered, the minimum noise figure is somewhat 
higher, as was shown in Figure 23-21. 
 
The derivation of (23-17) is reasonably straightforward, but does not provide 
a means for taking into account correlation between the shot current and Rack 
velocity noise. However, the elegant noise theory for linear-beam devices 
developed by Haus [23, 24] and Robinson [20] takes correlation into 
consideration.

Nonlinearities and Distortion  
 
 
This chapter addresses the problems of nonlinearities and distortion in amplifiers, 
which have reasonably constant gain over a wide dynamic range. Crossed-field 
amplifiers have no linear range of operation and are not considered. At small 
signal levels, the power output versus power input curve for a linear-beam 
amplifier is reasonably linear and signal distortion is small. As a device is driven 
toward saturation, the transfer characteristic becomes more and more nonlinear. 
This nonlinearity results in distortions of amplitude modulated (AM) or phase 
modulated (PM) signals for several reasons: 
 
 
â¢ 
AM/AM conversion; 
 
â¢ 
AM/PM conversion; 
 
â¢ 
Harmonic generation; 
 
â¢ 
Intermodulation distortion; 
 
â¢ 
Signal capturing. 
 
 
In addition, other signal distortions occur, which are not related to saturation 
effects. Noise, discussed in Chapter 23, is one example. Also, the following are 
often of concern: 
 
 
â¢ 
Variations of gain and power output with frequency; 
 
â¢ 
Phase nonlinearities or time delay distortion; 
 
â¢ 
Power supply and load effects (referred to as pushing and pulling).

The curve in Figure 24-1 shows the RF power output versus input for a TWT. The 
distortion of a signal is also indicated. A sinusoidal input signal to the TWT is

assumed and the resulting output signal is shown. The shape of the output signal 
was determined graphically, as is indicated by the dashed lines, by plotting output 
power levels for various input signal levels as a function of time. The distortion 
resulting from gain compression and saturation is apparent in the flat-topped shape 
of the output curve.

AM/AM conversion is a measure of the change in RF power output that 
results from a change in RF power input and is usually defined by the slope of the 
curve of RF power output versus RF power input expressed in dB/dB. Thus,

(24-1) 
 
AM/AM conversion and gain are shown as functions of RF power input in 
Figure 24-2. Gain is defined as the ratio of RF power output to RF power input. 
Two values of gain are usually of importance. These are the small signal gain and 
the saturated gain. Saturated gain is usually 5 to 6 dB less than small signal gain. 
 
In the linear (small signal) region, the AM/AM conversion is very nearly 1 
dB/dB. At saturation, where no change in output occurs as the input is varied, the 
AM/AM conversion is 0 dB/dB. 
 
AM/AM conversion is important in communication applications of TWTs. 
The specification of AM/AM conversion depends on the type of modulation used. 
For example, if amplitude modulation is employed and if amplitude distortion 
must be avoided, then it may be necessary to operate a TWT at a maximum power

level well below saturation. For this operating condition, we say that the power 
level must be âbacked offâ from saturation.  
 
The amount of âback offâ depends on the amplitude distortion that can be 
tolerated. Most amplitude modulation communication systems can tolerate no less 
than 0.9 dB/dB of AM/AM conversion [1]. If no provisions are made for 
linearizing a TWT, it may be necessary to back off as much as 6â8 dB to meet this 
AM/AM conversion requirement. Through the use of a pitch taper in a TWT [2, 3] 
and an external linearizing circuit, distortion is significantly reduced and it is 
possible to operate much closer to the saturation power level. Backed off operation 
is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.

24.1.2   AM/PM Conversion 
 
AM/PM conversion is a measure of the change in tube phase length that results 
from a change in RF drive level. This occurs because, as drive level is increased, 
more power is extracted from the electron beam and the velocity of the beam is 
reduced. As beam velocity decreases, the velocity of the RF wave on the circuit is 
reduced and this increases the phase length of the tube. It should be noted here that 
the cathode voltage supply may aggravate the phase delay. As drive increases, 
body current usually increases, which in turn increases the load on the cathode 
supply causing a reduction in voltage and an increase in phase length. 
 
A curve showing the variation of phase length with RF input power is given in 
Figure 24-3. In the linear region of the RF power output curve, phase shift is 
relatively insensitive to drive level. As drive is increased toward saturation, the 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons

phase length increases rapidly and then becomes constant again as the TWT 
saturates. The slope of the phase length curve in degrees/dB and shown in Figure 
24-4 is the AM/PM conversion.

Communications TWT and TWTA Handbook. 2007.) 
 
 
The maximum value of AM/PM conversion is usually the value that is 
specified. This occurs at 3 to 10 dB below the input power that produces 
saturation. The type of modulation employed determines the need for specifying 
AM/PM conversion. For example, in amplitude-modulated systems, AM/PM 
conversion can result in amplitude distortions. In multiple carrier systems in which 
both AM and PM signals are present, AM/PM conversion can cause distortion or 
interference with the phase- or frequency-modulated signals. Finally, amplitude 
variations in phase- or frequency-modulated systems can cause distortions or 
interference. 

Nonlinearities and Distortion

24.1.3   Harmonic Generation 
 
Near saturation, the electron bunches in a TWT become sharply defined, and so 
the RF current is rich in harmonics. In addition, as saturation is approached and 
the output signal becomes distorted, harmonics are generated. This is apparent 
from Figure 24-5 where a sinusoidal input signal has become flat-topped because 
of saturation. The fundamental and third and fifth harmonic components of the 
distorted output signal are shown in Figure 24-5. It will be shown in the next 
section that these harmonics are one of the sources of the intermodulation 
distortion produced by an amplifier. 
Fundamental
3rd Harmonic
5th Harmonic
 
Figure 24-5   Harmonics in flat-topped sine wave. 
 
 
Harmonics are also produced as the result of AM/PM conversion. This is 
illustrated in Figures 24-6 and 24-7. As a TWT is driven into saturation and the 
beam slows down, the phase of the output signal is delayed compared with the 
phase at small drive levels. As a result, the output curve for a sinusoidal input 
becomes a tilted sine wave. This tilted wave contains harmonics as shown in 
Figure 24-7. The third and fifth harmonics are phase shifted relative to those 
produced by amplitude distortion during saturation. These harmonics also 
contribute to intermodulation distortion. 
 
At saturation, helix TWTs used for communication applications usually 
produce second harmonic power that is 8 to 10 dB below the fundamental power. 
Third harmonic power at saturation is usually 23 to 18 dB below the fundamental 
power [2]. 
 
In some extremely broadband ECM applications, TWTs are used that operate 
with bandwidths greater than an octave. There have been cases where the second 
harmonic power output was equal to or greater than the fundamental power when 
one of these TWTs was driven to saturation at the low end of the frequency band. 
One of the reasons for this high harmonic output is that, at the low end of the band, 
the harmonic frequency is within the amplifying band of the TWT.

In coupled-cavity TWTs, the slow-wave structure is a filter that normally does 
not propagate harmonics. Even if the structure does contain a higher-order mode at 
a harmonic frequency, the field configuration is such that the interaction with the 
beam is weak. As a result, the harmonic output from a coupled-cavity TWT may 
be 30 dB or more below the fundamental power.

24.1.4   Intermodulation Products 
 
When two or more carrier signals are being amplified by a TWT, intermodulation 
occurs and signals (intermodulation products or intermods) are produced that are 
displaced from the carriers by multiples of the frequency separation of the carriers. 
This intermodulation occurs because of the nonlinearities in the amplification 
process. The third-and fifth-order intermods are the most important because they 
are closest to the signal frequencies and largest in amplitude. 
 
The origin of the intermods can be understood by examining operation with 
two carrier signals and the distortion of those signals during the amplification 
process. Consider, first, two carrier signals of equal amplitude as follows:

When the signal in Figure 24-8 is amplified by a TWT (or any other 
amplifier) in which saturation or AM/PM conversion occurs, the signal becomes 
distorted as shown in Figure 24-9. Harmonics of the modulation frequency and of 
the carrier frequency are generated. The total third harmonic signal, including the

When a TWT approaches saturation and gain decreases, gain compression 
occurs. It is also possible, at input levels below saturation, for gain expansion to 
occur. Gain expansion (exaggerated for clarity) is compared with gain 
compression in Figure 24-12.

Figure 24-12   Comparison of gain compression and gain expansion. 
 
 
Two causes for gain expansion (indicated in Figure 24-13) are the use of 
velocity steps or tapers and the use of a beam voltage greater than that which 
produces maximum gain (overvoltaging). If the beam is overvoltaged (the velocity 
parameter is too high), then the gain at small signal levels is less than optimum. As 
signal level is increased and more energy is extracted from the beam, then, as the 
beam slows down (and the velocity parameter decreases), gain increases.

Similarly, when a velocity step or taper is used then, at small signal levels 
where little energy is extracted from the beam, the beam will be going too fast for 
optimum interaction in the step or taper region. As signal level is increased, the 
beam will slow down in the step or taper region and gain will increase. 
 
The way in which gain expansion generates third-order intermods is indicated 
in Figure 24-14. For a sinusoidal input, the TWT output is distorted into a peaked 
shape. The third harmonic that is generated is 180Â° out of phase with that 
generated during gain compression and is the source of the third-order intermod. 
The affect of this phase difference is evident in Figure 24-15, which shows the 
third-order intermod for a TWT with a velocity taper and overvoltage [4]. As the 
drive power is increased so that operation moves from the gain expansion region 
to gain compression, the rate at which the third-order intermod increases varies 
significantly. This is in contrast to the linear increase in intermod level with 
increasing drive power that is usually experienced when only gain compression is 
present. 
 
An example of the variation of intermod levels with drive when only gain 
compression is present is shown in Figure 24-16. In this case, when the tube is 
driven to saturation, third-order intermodulation products are each 8 to 10 dB 
below the carrier signals (two carriers of equal amplitude are assumed). By 
reducing the amplitudes of the drive signals so that the TWT operates well below 
saturated power output, the amplitudes of the intermodulation products drops 
linearly and rapidly with drive power level. In the example in Figure 24-16, with 
the TWT operated about 10 dB below saturation, the third-order intermodulation 
products drop to about 40 dB below the signal output level.

The specification of intermodulation products is not straightforward. Usually, 
the amplitudes of the products are specified as the maximum allowable relative to 
the carrier signal levels, when these signals have equal amplitudes. The amplitude 
of the carrier signals is also usually specified relative to the saturated output power 
when the TWT is amplifying two signals of equal amplitude.

The method for specifying intermods illustrated in Figure 24-16 is called the 
intercept point method. This is based on an understanding of the rate at which the 
levels of the intermodulation products vary as drive level is varied. If one point is 
known, such as the intercept of the projection from the linear regions of the power 
curve for the carrier signals with the projection of the power curve for the third-
order intermods, then the amplitudes of the intermods can be calculated for various 
drive levels.

Figure 24-17 shows the intercept point for a TWT. This tube must operate 
about 10 dB below saturation (backed off 10 dB) for the third-order intermod to be 
30 dB below the carrier (C/3IM = 30 dB). 
 
24.2   Digital Communications 
 
A major application for traveling wave tubes is in digital communications systems. 
They have two major advantages over solid-state amplifiers. They are more 
efficient and they are more reliable [5, 6]. 
 
To understand the demands placed on TWTs, it is necessary to understand 
some of the basic aspects of digital communications. First of all, information is 
transmitted as a series of ones and zeros. One or more of the properties of the 
transmitted signal may be varied (modulated) as shown in Figure 24-18 to produce 
the ones and zeros. 
 
With frequency-shift keying (FSK) the frequency of a signal is switched 
between two values. One frequency represents a zero and the other represents a 
one. With amplitude-shift keying (ASK) the amplitude of the signal is switched 
between two values, and with phase-shift keying (PSK), phase is switched.

In the following sections, two modulation schemes, QPSK, which uses PSK 
and 16QAM, which uses PSK and ASK, will be discussed. The way in which PSK 
and ASK are implemented is as follows. As shown in Figure 24-19, a carrier 
signal generated by a local oscillator is split into two paths. One path contains a 
phase shifter that delays the signal 90Â° relative to the other path.  
 
The signal containing the information to be transmitted is split into two 
independent components, I (in phase) and Q (quadrature). The I signal is used to 
modulate one of the carriers from the local oscillator and the Q signal is used to 
modulate the other. The two modulated carriers are then added together. The result 
is a digitally modulated signal, the amplitude and phase of which are determined 
by the amplitudes of the I and Q modulating signals.

24.2.1   QPSK and 16QAM 
 
Data plots, referred to as constellation plots, for QPSK and 16QAM modulation 
techniques are shown in Figure 24-20. QPSK stands for quadrature phase-shift 
keying. With QPSK, there are four ideal positions (states) for the data points on 
the constellation plot. As shown in Figure 24-21, when QPSK is used, one signal 
serves as the phase reference and the other is phase shifted in increments that are 
multiples of 90Â°. Each phase state corresponds to information that is to be 
transmitted. For all practical purposes, from a TWT engineerâs point of view, 
phase shifts occur at random. Also, phase shifts do not occur instantaneously, but 
instead take place over several cycles as shown in Figure 24-21.

When 16QAM is used, there are 16 states on the constellation diagram. In this 
case, there are two amplitude states at a phase of 45Â° (and at 135Â°, 225Â°, and 
315Â°). There are also phase states at 15Â° and 75Â° into each quadrant of the 
constellation plot. The relative phases and amplitudes of the states in the first 
quadrant are shown in Figure 24-22.

24.2.2   Data Characteristics 
 
Digital data are transmitted in âbitsâ that have a long enough duration to make it 
possible to identify the frequency, phase and amplitude. The rates at which bits are 
generated and transmitted are critical characteristics of a digital communications 
system. 
 
A figure of merit for a digital transmission is Eb/No where Eb is the energy of 
the bit and No is the noise power density. Eb/No is the digital systems equivalent of 
the signal to noise ratio (SNR). The digital data rate, R, for a system is the rate at 
which bits are transmitted. The average signal power is EbR. 
  
Because of noise and amplifier characteristics, impairment of bits occurs. This 
is illustrated for QPSK in Figures 24-23 and 24-24. A bit with no impairment is 
shown in Figure 24-23(a). The amplitude and phase of the signal are exactly those 
required to place the bit on the target spot (State 11) on the constellation diagram. 
In Figure 24-23(b), the amplitude is impaired and in Figure 24-23(c) the phase is 
impaired but the bits are still identified as belonging to State 11. In Figure 
24-23(d) phase has been badly distorted and so the signal is identified erroneously 
as belonging to State 01. In general, as shown in Figure 24-24, Gaussian noise and 
intermodulation distortions cause the signal to fall in a circular area about the 
target point. Amplitude distortion produces radial patterns and phase distortion 
produces angular patterns.

The effect of a weak signal (low SNR) on the 16QAM constellation is shown 
in Figure 24-25. No impairments are shown when Eb/No = 11 dB. There are a few 
impairments (indicated by the large dots) when Eb/No = 6 dB and many 
impairments when Eb/No = 2 dB. These figures illustrate the importance of 
maintaining a high SNR.

24.2.3   Amplifier Design to Reduce Distortion 
 
From the foregoing discussion it is seen that the phase characteristics of the bits 
are extremely important. In QPSK, a phase error of > 45Â° will cause a signal to be 
interpreted in the wrong state. In 16QAM, phase is even more critical. Since phase 
states are only 30Â° apart, a phase error of > 15Â° will place the signal in the wrong 
state. Thus, it is clear that phase linearity is a very important characteristic of an 
amplifier.

Power and phase characteristics are shown for a conventional TWT in Figure 
24-26(a) and for a TWT amplifier designed for phase linearity in Figure 24-26(b). 
The conventional design produced a phase shift of ~ 40Â° at saturation. For the 
TWT designed to minimize AM/PM, phase shift was < 10Â° near saturation. The 
design resulted in slight gain expansion and a nonuniform AM/AM curve [7].

Even though TWTs are more efficient than solid-state amplifiers, their 
efficiency is far less than the maximum that they are capable of at saturation. This 
is because of the requirements for low intermodulation distortion. These 
requirements are in addition to the phase linearity requirements discussed earlier.

The reductions in intermods that result from operating backed off are shown 
in Figures 24-28 and 24-29. When backed off operation is 9 dB below saturation, 
C/3IM is about 37 dBc. To achieve this level of performance, the helix design was 
optimized for intermod reduction. As shown in Figure 24-29, a tube with a 
standard helix had an intermod level about 7 dB higher than the tube with the 
optimized helix [8].

To improve amplifier linearity and reduce intermodulation products, the 
technique [8] of predistorting the input signal to the amplifier is used (see Figure 
24-30). Predistortion offsets the gain compression and phase shifts that cause 
intermod production. In addition, feedforward circuits [4] are often used to cancel 
the intermods from the TWT. The input signal and a small part of the amplifier 
output signal are fed into a correction amplifier, which amplifies the nonlinear 
signals from the TWT and mixes them out of phase with the TWT output to cancel 
the intermodulation products.

686 
 
Predistortion can reduce the intermod level by 10 to 20 dB, and the 
feedforward circuit can reduce it by about 30 dB. Depending on the regulatory 
levels of intermods allowed, the main power amplifier must produce third-order 
intermod levels C/3IM of 20 to 40 dBc. This requires very linear performance by 
the TWT, which results from operating the tube well below saturation.

24.3   SIGNAL CAPTURING 
 
In the previous sections, it was assumed that the two signals applied to a TWT 
were amplified by the same amount. This is a correct assumption when the 
frequencies of the two signals are close together. However, when the two 
frequencies are widely separated but still within the bandwidth of the tube, the 
lower-frequency signal will be amplified more than the high-frequency signal. 
This phenomenon is referred to as the capture effect or as signal capturing. Figure 
24-31 shows the effect of frequency difference on the power outputs of two signals 
of equal amplitude being amplified at the same time by a TWT. These results were 
measured at a power level for single frequency drive that was several dB below 
saturation. When the signal separation was 0.8 GHz, the low frequency signal was 
amplified by about 3 dB more than the high-frequency signal. 
 
For the results in Figure 24-32 the frequency separation was constant but the 
drive power was varied (with equal signal amplitudes). At low drive levels, the 
gains for the two signals were equal. As saturation was approached, the gain for 
the low-frequency signal became larger than for the high-frequency signal and was 
about 10 dB higher at saturation. 
 
Signal capturing is of little or no importance in applications of TWTs where 
the separation in frequencies of the signals is small. In electronic countermeasures 
applications, however, very broadband TWTs are sometimes used and the 
frequency separation of the signals can be large. In these cases, signal capturing 
does occur.

24.4   VARIATIONS WITH FREQUENCY 
 
When the gain versus frequency characteristics of a TWT are examined, two 
distinct types of gain variation are usually observed. One is a broadband variation 
for which the gain varies slowly as a function of frequency. The other is a 
relatively rapid variation of gain in narrow bandwidths.

24.4.1   Broadband Gain Variations 
 
An example of the broadband variation in gain is shown in Figure 24-33. This gain 
characteristic was computed for small-signal operation of a coupled-cavity TWT 
[1]. The variation in gain with frequency results from the dispersion and 
impedance characteristics of the circuit along with the fact that gain varies with the 
electrical length of the circuit, which, in turn, varies with frequency. The 
imposition of a tight specification on gain flatness results in compromises in 
circuit design and beam conditions that reduce output power and efficiency. In an 
example [1], output power was a factor of 2.5 lower for the TWT with the required 
gain flatness than for a TWT designed for maximum efficiency.

âNASA Contractor Report 185146,â January 1990.) 
 
24.4.2   Narrowband Gain Variations 
 
In narrow bandwidths, the dominant effect on gain is usually some feedback path 
within the TWT. For example, internal mismatches, which can never be 
completely eliminated, cause a periodic (with frequency) variation in gain. Figure 
24-34 shows how this can occur. A mismatch at the output end of the slow wave 
structure causes the reflection of a small portion of the signal. This portion is then 
reflected by a mismatch at the input end of the structure. It then combines, in 
various phase relationships, with the desired growing wave. The result is that a 
âgain rippleâ is produced as is shown in Figure 24-35. This particular curve was 
calculated for the millimeter-wave coupled-cavity TWT mentioned in a previous 
paragraph [4]. The frequency difference between gain peaks depends on the 
frequency of operation and the length of the RF circuit (which produce a closed-
loop phase change of 360Â°) and is usually in the 100â300-MHz range.

Internal reflections within a TWT are the primary cause for gain ripple. These 
reflections can occur at the following locations: 
 
 
1. At the attenuator at the end of the input section of the TWT. These 
reflections are then rereflected at the input port to the TWT. 
 
2. Within the center section of a TWT with two severs. 
 
3. At the output port. These reflections are then rereflected at the sever or 
attenuator at the input end of the output section. This feedback path is 
usually the dominant path because gain is high and reflections from the 
output port vary with load characteristics. An isolator at the output helps 
control load reflections. 
 
4. At imperfections in the slow wave structure. Periodically varying 
imperfections, for example at helix support rods, can be particularly 
detrimental in this respect. 
 
It is also possible for returning electrons from the collector to provide a feedback 
path that produces gain ripple. 
 
24.4.3   Phase Nonlinearities or Time Delay Distortion 
 
Shown in Figure 24-36 are phase and time delay as functions of frequency. A 
linear increase of phase as a function of frequency is unavoidable because the 
phase length of a TWT depends on wavelength. The ripple portion of the phase 
curve depends on the same internal reflection phenomena that produce gain ripple. 
Time delay is the total time that it takes for a signal to pass through a TWT and is 
the derivative of phase delay. Thus, the same mechanisms that cause phase 
nonlinearities are responsible for time delay distortion.

The frequency band of interest is indicated in Figure 24-36 to illustrate the 
fact that, for most TWTs, the narrowband effects dominate the broadband effects. 
This is true because most TWTs operate over only a small portion of the passband 
of the circuit and so band edge effects are far from the frequency band of interest. 
 
 
24.5   PUSHING AND PULLING 
 
When an operating parameter, such as the beam voltage, varies, the RF 
performance of a tube is affected. The pushing figure is a measure of the change in 

Nonlinearities and Distortion 
 
691 
a performance characteristic that occurs as a result of a change in an operating 
parameter. For example, the cathode- phase pushing figure is the change in phase 
of the output that results from a change in cathode voltage. 
 
There is also a pulling figure and this has to do with the effect of the load on 
the tube. The load impedance has an effect on the power output and on the 
stability of the tube. 
 
24.5.1   Amplitude Pushing 
 
Amplitude pushing figures are relatively easy to determine. To measure amplitude 
pushing figures, the change in power output produced by a change in one of the 
tube operating parameters is measured. Typical specifications for the maximum 
values for the amplitude pushing figures for a tube with a gridded gun are as 
follows: 
 
â¢ 
Cathode pushing: 
0.5 dB per 1% change in cathode voltage, Va; 
â¢ 
Grid pushing: 
0.5 dB per 1% change in grid voltage, Vg; 
â¢ 
RF drive pushing: 
0.5 dB per 1 dB change in RF input power. 
 
These pushing figures are all specified for operation at or very close to the 
nameplate operating conditions. 
 
24.5.1.1 Amplitude Pushing with Gridless Guns

As a result, for ÎVa/Va = 1%, the theoretical cathode pushing figure for a gridless 
gun is 
 
 
 
cathode pushing = 0.11  dB  /  1% change in a
V  
(24-19) 
 
The amplitude pushing that results from a change in RF drive level depends 
on the power transfer characteristic of the tube. If the tube is operating saturated, 
then, of course, RF drive pushing is zero. However, if the tube is operating below 
or above saturation, then RF drive pushing must be determined experimentally. 
 
24.5.1.2 Amplitude Pushing with Gridded Guns 
 
The calculation of the dependence of the amplitude pushing figure on the voltages 
in a gridded gun is not as straightforward as for the gridless gun. Of course, for 
constant efficiency, the RF power output is still proportional to the product of 
cathode current and voltage, but the current depends on grid voltage as well as 
cathode voltage. The way in which current varies with these voltages depends on 
the construction of the grid. 
 
For example, if the wires of the grid are very close together, then the grid-
cathode region behaves as a space charge limited diode and is shielded from the 

Nonlinearities and Distortion 
 
693 
effects of the anode. As a result, current depends on the 3/2 power of grid voltage 
and is independent of anode voltage. 
 
If, on the other hand, the wires of the grid are far apart, then the field 
established by the anode penetrates to the surface of the cathode and so the 
cathode voltage controls the current. The grid voltage has little effect on the 
current. 
 
With the grid wire spacing that is used in practice, it is found that the current 
is almost linearly dependent on grid voltage and that it varies as the square root of 
cathode voltage, that is

and so the expected cathode pushing figure is well below the specification of 
0.5 dB/1% given at the beginning of this section for a gridded gun.

g
V  
(24-28) 
and this is over an order of magnitude below the specified value of 0.5 dB/1%. 
 
24.5.2   Phase Pushing 
 
To measure phase pushing figures, it is necessary to make accurate measurements 
of relatively small changes in phase of the RF output when an operating parameter 
is changed. Typical specifications for the maximum values for the phase pushing 
figures are:  
 
â¢ 
Cathode pushing: 
55Â° per 1% change in Va; 
â¢ 
Grid pushing: 
12Â° per 1% change in Vg; 
â¢ 
Collector pushing: 
0.002Â° per 1 V change in collector voltage; 
â¢ 
Filament pushing: 
10Â° per 1% change in filament voltage; 
â¢ 
RF drive pushing: 
10Â° per 1 dB change in RF input power. 
 
These pushing figures are all specified for operation at or very close to the 
nameplate operating conditions. 
 
The calculation of phase pushing figures is not as straightforward as the 
calculation of amplitude pushing figures. For example, consider cathode pushing. 
The total phase length of the tube, Ï, is proportional to the time that it takes for the 
RF signal to travel through the tube. That time is the length of the RF section 
divided by the phase velocity, vp, of the signal on the circuit. As a result,

For small signal levels, Pierceâs theory gives the relation between a change in 
beam velocity and the resulting change in velocity of propagation of the signal on 
the circuit. The result is shown in Figure 24-37. Remember, b is Pierceâs velocity 
parameter, which relates the beam velocity to the cold circuit phase velocity. Y1 is 
the incremental propagation constant of the signal on the circuit. Notice that the 
slope of the y1 versus b lines is nearly 1/2. The reason for this is that the velocity 
of the slow space charge wave (the bunch velocity) is controlled by the cold circuit 
phase velocity, which is constant, as well as by the beam velocity.

To use this relation, the phase length of the tube, Ï, must be known. For 
traveling wave tubes, this phase length is usually ~ 5,000â10,000Â° and so the 
cathode phase pushing figure is usually

which is well below the maximum specified value of 55Â°/1%. It must be 
remembered that this result is based on Pierceâs small signal theory. In practice, 
measured cathode phase- pushing figures are a factor of about two above this 
result. 
 
Grid phase pushing occurs because, as grid voltage changes, beam current 
changes and this, in turn, changes the electron density in the beam. (Here, beam 
diameter will be assumed not to change.) As electron density changes, plasma 
frequency changes and so the velocity of the slow space-charge wave, vsscw, 
changes. As was the case for cathode pushing (and from Figure 24-28), the 
resulting change in the velocity of the signal on the circuit is one half of the 
change in  vsscw. The velocity of the slow space-charge wave is

1/2 of this or 0.025%. Since the total phase is 5,000 â 10,000Â°, the change in phase

which is much less than the maximum specified value of 12Â°/1%. Again, we must 
remember that this result is based on Pierceâs small signal theory. In practice, 
measured grid phase pushing figures are a factor of two to three above this result. 
 
Next, consider phase pushing by the filament voltage. Fluctuations or changes 
in filament voltage (and current) can have two effects on tube operation: 
 
 
1. For slow variations in voltage, the cathode temperature changes. If the 
position of the cathode changes because of thermal expansion or 
contraction of the cathode support structure, then the cathode current 
changes and this, in turn, causes phase pushing. Also, if the cathode is not 
completely space-charge limited, emission will change with temperature 
and this will affect phase. 
2. Fluctuations in filament current cause variations in the magnetic field 
generated by the filament. If the filament magnetic field links through the 
cathode surface, then the focusing of electrons in the gun and beam size 
are affected. As beam size fluctuates, the potential depression in the beam 
and the beam velocity vary, affecting the phase length of the tube. 
 
 
It would appear that the collector should not have an effect on phase because 
the beam has completed its interaction with the circuit before entering the 
collector. However, fluctuations in the collector voltage can cause variations in the 
current reflected by the collector. Even a small current traveling backwards 
through a tube can carry a signal from output to input. As this signal combines 
with the input signal in various phase relations, the amplitude and phase of the 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
698 
resulting signal that is launched on the circuit vary. As a result, there is an effect 
on the phase and amplitude of the RF output. 
 
The primary reason why the RF drive level affects phase is that, as drive is 
increased, more and more of the energy in the electron beam is converted to RF 
power output. As a result, the beam loses energy and its velocity decreases. As the 
velocity decreases, phase length increases. 
 
24.5.3   Pulling 
 
RF power generated within a microwave tube is transmitted to a load as shown in 
Figure 24-38. There may be (and, to some extent, always are) impedance 
mismatches at several places in the output transmission line where RF power is 
reflected back toward or away from the tube. Reflected power that enters the tube 
affects tube operation. This effect of the load on tube operation is referred to as 
âpulling.â 
 
The pulling effects that may be produced by reflected power are variations in 
the following: 
 
 
1. Amplitude of the RF output power; 
 
2. Phase of the RF output power; 
 
3. For an oscillator, frequency of the RF output power. 
 
Load reflections may also cause an amplifier to produce unwanted signals. 
 
There is no straightforward way to predict the pulling effects of a load. 
Instead these effects must be measured by using loads that produce known voltage 
standing-wave ratios with known phases.

Breakdown and Protection 
 
 
One of the most common and, perhaps, most poorly understood classes of failure 
mechanisms in microwave tubes centers on electrical breakdown. In the courses from 
which this book was originally developed, electrical breakdown was, at first, only 
briefly discussed. Because of the strong interest in breakdown phenomena expressed 
by those taking the course, that section was developed to cover major aspects of 
breakdown phenomena of concern to those who use microwave tubes. 
 
Breakdown in microwave tubes may occur inside or outside the vacuum 
envelope at any of several locations as is indicated here and in Figure 25-1. 
 
 
â¢ 
Electron gun (between electrodes, or leads, or from electrodes or leads to 
ground); 
 
â¢ 
Collector (between electrodes, or leads, or from electrodes or leads to 
ground); 
 
â¢ 
High-power portions of the RF structure. 
 
 
Often, it is not the tube that is at fault. For example, there may be a failure at any 
one of several locations in the RF system. If excessive RF power is reflected, the tube 
may be damaged for any one of several reasons. All too often the tube is thought to be 
at fault and is replaced before the original cause of the difficulty is corrected. 
 
Whether or not breakdown will occur depends on two factors: 
 
 
1. 
The applied field level and local field enhancement effects; 
 
2. 
The breakdown field of the medium (gas, vacuum, liquid, or solid). 
 
 
Very approximately, the breakdown fields for various media are as follows: 
 
â¢ 
Gas  
~ tens of V/cm to 105 V/cm depending on pressure and type; 
â¢ 
Vacuum 
~ 0.5â3Ã105 V/cm; 
â¢ 
Liquid 
~ 0.5â1.0Ã106 V/cm; 
â¢ 
Solid 
~ 0.5â1.0Ã106 V/cm.

At interfaces between solids, liquids and vacuum, or gas, the breakdown field 
may be significantly degraded. In addition, in a void in a solid or a liquid, the field is 
normally enhanced. The amount of enhancement depends on the shape and 
orientation of the void and the dielectric constants of the media, as indicated in Figure 
25-2.

coupled with various field enhancement effects result in breakdown occurring, in 
most cases, in the vacuum or gas rather than in the solid or liquid. As a result, most of 
the breakdown discussions in this chapter will concentrate on vacuum and gas. First, a 
section is devoted to various field enhancement effects that reduce the value of the 
applied field at which breakdown occurs. Then, dc and RF breakdown in vacuum and 
in gas are covered. Breakdown in or across an insulator is sometimes a cause of 
failure and is also discussed.

25.1   FIELD ENHANCEMENT 
 
The electric field between parallel plane electrodes is the voltage applied from one 
electrode to the other divided by the distance by which the electrodes are separated. In 
practice, it is common to calculate field levels in all sorts of configurations simply by 
dividing the applied voltage by the electrode separation distance. Fields calculated in 
this manner are often in error by a factor of from two to ten or more. Worse yet, 
because the power varies as the square of the field, the calculated power-handling 
capability is often in error by a factor ranging up to two orders of magnitude or more. 
 
The parallel plane and coaxial conductors shown in Figure 25-3 provide a simple 
case for the comparison of field levels. A potential of 1,000V between electrodes is 
assumed, and equipotential profiles at 250V, 500V, and 750V are shown. For the 
parallel-plane electrode case, the potential profiles are equally spaced and the electric 
field is 1,000V/cm everywhere between the electrodes. 
 
For the coaxial electrode case, the equipotential profiles near the center 
conductor are more closely spaced than in the parallel plane electrode case. The 
electric field at the surface of the center conductor is easy to calculate for this 
configuration and is 1560 V/cm, or over 50% above that for parallel plane electrodes.

If the maximum field was limited to 1,000 V/cm because of breakdown 
considerations, then the maximum voltage that could be applied to the coaxial 
electrodes would be 1,000/1.56, or 641V. In the TE11 mode (for which the potential 
distributions in Figure 25-3 are correct), the maximum RF power capability of the 
coaxial configuration would be (1/1.56)2, or 40% of that for the parallel-plane 
electrodes. 
 
The factor by which the electric field exceeds the field for the parallel-plane 
electrode case is normally called the field enhancement factor, and is denoted by Î². At 
the center conductor of the 50-â¦ coaxial line, the field enhancement factor is 1.56.

Field enhancement factors have been calculated for many electrode 
configurations. Some of these are given in Figure 25-4. In most practical cases of 
interest, the electrode geometries are close enough to those shown in Figure 25-4 to 
permit a reasonable estimate of the value of Î² to be made. In some cases, values of Î² 
for two or more configurations can be combined to obtain an estimate for a 
configuration in question. For example, the value of Î² at the surface of a drop of 
condensation on the center conductor of a 50-â¦ coaxial line is approximately 3 (Î² for 
a hemisphere on a plane) times 1.56 (Î² at the center conductor of a 50-â¦ coaxial line), 
or about 4.7.

Obstacles of various shapes are often purposely placed in waveguides and 
coaxial lines. This may be for impedance matching purposes, for mounting dielectric 
supports, and so forth. Values of Î² and power handling degradation are given in 
Figure 25-5 for some of these obstacle shapes in a rectangular waveguide. Note that 
the reduction in power capability can easily be an order of magnitude or more. 
 
The importance of field enhancement on electrical breakdown cannot be 
overemphasized. The most troublesome aspect of field enhancement is that, in many 
cases, its magnitude is either not known or is badly underestimated. The value of Î² of 
1.56 calculated for the center conductor of a 50-â¦ coaxial line is virtually 
meaningless if there are irregularities, such as scratches or machining marks, and so 
forth on the center conductor. These can easily have a Î² of 10 or more.

25.2   DC BREAKDOWN IN VACUUM [1â3] 
 
Under ideal conditions, the breakdown field for vacuum exceeds that of all media 
including liquids and solids, and may be 10 MV/cm or higher. The upper limit results 
from field emission from the negative electrode. In practice, the field at which 
breakdown occurs is two to three orders of magnitude below the upper limit. For 
example, for average gap lengths (~1 cm), breakdown occurs at a few tens to a few 
hundreds of kV/cm. 
 
For many vacuum tube applications, âKilpatrickâs criterionâ [4] is used as the 
guideline to the maximum electric field that can be used in vacuum if breakdown is to 
be avoided. According to Kilpatrick, breakdown in vacuum varies as electrode 
spacing raised to the 0.75 power. Kilpatrick refers to field levels below this criterion 
as the no-spark region and to higher field levels as the possible-spark region.

Figure 25-6 contains Kilpatrickâs criterion and some results from the tube 
industry [5, 6]. The shaded areas indicate roughly the values of plate hold-off voltages 
for gridded tubes with cylindrical configurations and with thoriated tungsten (ThW) 
or oxide-coated cathodes. The data points represent the experimental breakdown 
characteristics of Pierce guns. The points marked by circles are for dc operation. The 
triangles and crosses represent long pulse and short pulse operation, respectively. 
Other results presented by Staprans [7] are in basic agreement with those given in 
Figure 25-6. Note that, for pulse operation, field levels somewhat above the 
Kilpatrick curve are sometimes used.

The Kilpatrick criterion is based on results for parallel plane electrodes while the 
tube results in Figure 25-6 are for various electrode configurations. Thus, varying 
degrees of field enhancement contribute to the scatter in the data. Apparently, when 
oxide coated cathodes are used, decomposition products form surface layers of 
reduced work function, greater roughness, different hardness, and so forth, which 
result in reduced  breakdown voltage. 
 
25.2.1   Electrode Phenomena Leading to Breakdown 
 
The mechanisms responsible for breakdown in vacuum at field levels that are orders 
of magnitude below the field emission limit for a planar surface have been under 
investigation for decades. The electrode phenomena thought most likely to lead to 
vacuum breakdown in microwave tubes are shown in Figure 25-7. These phenomena 
and the way in which they cause breakdown are discussed in this section.

25.2.1.1   Breakdown Caused by Microprotrusions 
 
To understand how microprotrusions can cause breakdown, it is necessary to 
investigate field emission phenomena. As was discussed in the chapter on cathodes, 
as the electric field applied to a cathodic electrode is increased to 107â108 V/cm (0.1â
1.0 V/Ã), electron emission increases very rapidly. The reason for this can be 
explained with the aid of Figure 25-8. At very high field levels, the potential barrier 
that electrons must overcome to escape from a metal becomes very narrow. It is so 
narrow, in fact, that when the wave function of an electron is examined, it is found 
that there is a finite probability that the electron may exist on the vacuum side of the 
barrier. In effect, electrons can pass through the barrier even though they don't have 
sufficient energy to overcome the barrier. This is known as the tunneling effect. 
 
When a microprotrusion like that shown in Figure 25-9 is present, equipotential 
surfaces near the tip are crowded together so the electric field is higher than on nearby 
planar surfaces. If the field enhancement factor, Î², at the tip is high enough (~ 100 or 
more) then field emission can occur at average field levels of ~ 105 V/cm.

Microprotrusions can originate in several ways including the following: 
 
 
1. 
Machining operations on some materials can produce sharp fibers. 
 
2. 
A freshly polished surface can have filamentary structures lying in the plane 
of the surface. These can be erected normal to the surface by the strong 
electromechanical forces associated with a large electric field. 
 
3. 
It is possible for microprotrusions to grow in the presence of large electric 
fields. This is a field activated surface diffusion process that is enhanced by 
heating the negative surface. Published data suggest that this effect is 
pronounced with electrode materials such as copper and aluminum that give 
unstable gaps. 
 
 
For breakdown to be initiated by a microprotrusion, a microplasma must be 
generated. This is only possible if localized melting and vaporization of electrode 
material takes place. Outgassing can contribute to this process. As shown in Figure 
25-12, there are two ways in which this can happen: 
 
 
1. 
Cathode-initiated breakdown results from vaporization by current flow and 
resistive heating of the tip of a microprotrusion. 
 
2. 
Anode-initiated breakdown occurs if the electron stream from the 
microprotrusion heats a spot on the anode to the point where melting and 
vaporization occur.

As indicated in Figure 25-13, there can also be in-flight vaporization of a 
microparticle released from the anode hot spot. 
 
Whether breakdown is cathode initiated or anode initiated depends on the field 
enhancement factor of the microprotrusion. Utsumi [8] found the high Î² emitters 
(Î² > ~ 500) (see Figure 25-14) usually lead to cathode-initiated breakdown while low 
Î² emitters (Î² < ~ 30) lead to anode-initiated breakdown. As shown in Figure 25-15, 
Utsumi also found that electrode separation played a role in determining whether 
breakdown was anode initiated or cathode initiated.

25.2.1.2   Breakdown Caused by Clumps 
 
Cranberg [9] recognized that, in the presence of a high electric field, there are strong 
electro-mechanical forces. These forces tend to detach microparticles or clumps of 
microparticles from electrodes as shown in Figure 25-16. These clumps are charged 
to the same polarity as the parent electrode so they are also repelled. The resulting 
charged particles are accelerated to high velocities during the transit to the opposite 
electrode. On impact, particle energy is dissipated as heat and/or mechanical shock 
energy. If the impact energy is large enough, there can be sufficient vaporization of 
the particle and target to form a microplasma and, possibly, cause breakdown. 
 
For large particles, breakdown can occur between a particle in transit and the 
electrode surface that it approaches. This can lead to breakdown of the gap. 
 
When a particle strikes a surface, a crater can be produced. The splash rim of 
material surrounding the crater may have sharp protrusions that field emit and result 
in breakdown. 
 
A very practical indication of the role of particles in breakdown may be had from 
a technique sometimes used by the tube industry, apparently to eliminate breakdown 
caused by particles. An electron gun to be highly stressed is placed in a vacuum 
chamber, high voltage is applied, and it is vibrated until arcing stops. The process 
may be repeated with varying orientations of the gun. Particles are observed to fall 
from the gun during the process, and it is presumed that they are the cause of arcing.

Examples of  particles and sources of particles that can lead to breakdown are: 
 
 
â¢ 
Debris in the gun from the manufacturing process; 
 
â¢ 
Careless assembly procedures that cause chipping of insulators or other 
damage; 
 
â¢ 
Dust from inadequate cleanliness; 
 
â¢ 
Cathode evaporants that form loose films on various gun surfaces; 
 
â¢ 
Use of improper getters; 
 
â¢ 
Particles from heater potting material; 
 
â¢ 
Debris that enter the gun through the anode aperture; 
 
â¢ 
Embedded particles that are exposed by chemical etching. 
 
 
In addition to these examples, as indicted in Figure 25-17, a shower of 
microparticles Figure 25-17(b) can be produced by the impact of a primary 
microparticle from the opposing electrode Figure 25-17(a). A shower of 
microparticles can also be produced by an arc in vacuum (to be discussed later in this 
chapter) and this can, subsequently, produce breakdown.  
 
To find a relation for the conditions under which breakdown may be initiated by 
a clump, it is necessary to consider the energy, U, acquired by a particle that is 
accelerated across a gap. That energy is the product of the particle charge, q, and the 
accelerating voltage, V, that is 
 
 
 
U = q V

Figure 25-18 shows that the Cranberg limit applies to cathode-modulated Pierce 
guns. For anode-modulated tubes and dc-operated tubes the EV limit is closer to 
103 (kV)2/mm. From Pierce gun design considerations, Durand and Shroff concluded 
that the relation between ElimV and V should be

This predicts that Elim should increase with voltage. The dashed line in Figure 25-18 
indicates the average of the ElimV products for Pierce guns and shows that there is, in 
fact, a trend for the maximum field to increase with increasing voltage.  
 
It is interesting to observe that Kilpatrickâs criterion (Figure 25-6)  shows that, as 
spacing increases, the average electric field at which breakdown occurs decreases by 
about a factor of five (from ~ 200 kV/cm to ~ 40 kV/cm) as breakdown voltage 
increases from 20 kV to 400 kV. Over this same voltage range, (25-11) predicts that 
Elim should increase by about a factor of two before breakdown occurs. Of course, we 
can understand from the Cranberg theory why Elim can increase as the average field 
decreases. It is Elim that is responsible for the charging of a clump and it is the gap 
voltage (and the average gap field) that accelerates the clump. The clump energy 
necessary to initiate breakdown is proportional to the product of the two fields and 
Thus, as one decreases, the other can increase.

Pulse length affects the maximum EV product as is shown in Figure 25-19. As 
pulse length increases, EV decreases. Durand and Shroff note that, when points 
corresponding to high values of EV are connected, almost all guns are below a limit 
given by 
 
 
 
0.34

EV = 
 
(25-12) 
This limit must be taken into consideration during the design of electron guns. It 
should be noted that the squares in Figure 25-19 are the results of breakdown 
experiments on high- voltage guns from X-band klystrons at SLAC. These results 
show that it is possible to exceed the limit indicated by (25-12). 
 
In Figures 25-18 and 25-19, most of the data indicate EV limits well below the 
Cranberg value of 104 (kV)2/mm. There is the possibility that an explanation given by 
Latham may account for some of the low EV values. As shown in Figure 25-20 a 
particle may bounce back and forth between two electrodes and gradually acquire 
enough energy to cause breakdown. As a result, the gap voltage required to produce 
breakdown may be significantly below that needed for breakdown caused by a single-
transit particle.

Durand and Shroff attributed the low EV values in Pierce guns to the presence of 
a cathode. Not only are the cathode and nearby electrodes very hot, there is the 
deposition of cathode evaporants (especially barium) to contend with. With attention

25.2.1.3   Breakdown Caused by Electron Pinholes 
 
The clump hypothesis for the initiation of breakdown appears to be valid. However, 
for breakdown thought to be initiated by microprotrusions: 
 
 
1. Fowler-Nordheim plots predict unrealistic values of Î² (> 250 in some cases). 
 
2. 
Often, no microprotrusions of the appropriate dimensions can be seen on the 
virgin electrodes. 
 
As a result, in the mid-1970s the search for alternate emission mechanisms started. 
The result was the discovery of electron pinholes. In addition to the effect of loose 
particles, it has been demonstrated that a micron-sized particle like the insulating 
particle shown in Figure 25-21 that is attached to an electrode surface or partly 
imbedded in the surface can be the site for the initiation of breakdown.

An excellent diagram for demonstrating the existence of electron pinholes is 
shown in Figure 25-22. The results of a scanning tunneling microscope (STEM) scan 
of an emitting site are shown. In the STEM process, a positively biased tungsten tip 
tracks an electrode surface at a constant distance from the surface. Spacing is 
determined by the tunneling current collected by the probe. As the probe approaches a 
pinhole with enhanced emitting properties (Î² > 1), the probe has to move away from 
the surface to maintain a constant current (with fixed bias). From the displacement of 
the probe from the surface Figure 25-22(a), the emitting properties of the surface 
Figure 25-22(b) can be determined. It has been shown that both the edge and the 
center of a particle can emit.

The research of R.V. Latham [10] has provided a great deal of insight into the 
electron pinhole phenomena that cause this breakdown. The key results of Lathamâs 
studies (and the studies of others referenced by Latham) are summarized in Figure 
25-23, which contrasts the properties of emission from a particulate site with that 
from a metallic whisker. In summary, the results show the following: 
 
 
1. 
The basic emission process is associated with micron-sized particulate 
structures on the cathode surface. Frequently, such structures appear to be 
electrically insulated from the metal surface. 
 
2. 
The material composition of the particles can be very varied, and apparently 
independent of the substrate cathode metal, with carbon being the single 
most common emission material, typically accounting for 20% of all sites. 
 
3. 
In contrast to the linear Fowler-Nordheim characteristic of the metallic 
whisker, particulate emission sites have nonlinear characteristics, 
particularly at high fields. 
 
4. 
Emission images obtained from individual sites indicate that the electrons 
originate from a number of apparently independent subsites that switch on 
and off randomly with mean frequencies that are dependent on pressure. 
 
5. 
The electrons emitted from individual subsites have single-peak spectra that 
are symmetrical in shape, have large half-widths (typically > 300 meV), and 
exhibit a strong field-dependent shift from the Fermi level, which is 
characteristic of a nonmetallic emission mechanism. The key physical

718 
implication of these data is that the emission process must involve the 
creation of hot electrons and that, consequently, the emission regime itself 
must include a dielectric or semiconducting medium. 
 
6. 
The emission of electrons is associated with an electroluminescent effect 
that indicates the involvement of a semiconducting or insulating medium. 
 
 
On the basis of the results listed above, two possible models shown in Figure 
25-24 for the emission sites have been proposed. The M-I-V model involves a metal-
insulator-vacuum regime. In the presence of a high electric field, electrons tunnel 
from the Fermi level of the metal into the conduction band of the insulator. They then 
move through the insulator under the influence of the penetrating field. Upon 
approaching the insulator-vacuum interface, the electrons experience very much 
higher field conditions, which cause them to be heated (accelerated) to temperatures 
in excess of 1,000Â°C. As a result, they are able to be quasi-thermionically emitted into 
the vacuum over the surface potential barrier at an energy that is significantly below 
the Fermi level. It is also assumed with this model that traps are present in the bulk of 
the insulator and these serve to control the flow of current at high field levels. This is 
the cause of the nonlinear Fowler-Nordheim characteristic shown in Figure 25-23.

The metallic particle in contact with the insulating surface in the M-I-M-V model 
in Figure 25-24(b) serves to enhance the field at its contact point with the insulator. A 
conducting channel is formed in the region of the contact point and electrons are 
emitted into the metal flake as well as into the vacuum.

25.2.2    Avoiding Breakdown 
 
Four primary factors must be considered in avoiding breakdown: 
 
 
1. 
Electrode geometry; 
 
2.  Electrode material; 
 
3.  Electrode surface preparation; 
 
4.  Electrode conditioning. 
 
The area and spacing of electrodes along with field enhancement characteristics, all 
have strong effects on breakdown voltage. Obviously, radii should be as large as 
possible to minimize Î². High Î² regions like slotted screw heads should be avoided or 
shielded. An increase in area will generally reduce breakdown voltage because more 
emitting sites and microparticles will be exposed.  
 
For small spacings (< ~ 0.5 mm), breakdown tends to be field dependent. This 
indicates that breakdown is initiated by microprotrusion or electron pinhole 
phenomena. For large spacings (> ~ 2 mm), breakdown becomes voltage dependent. 
This indicates that breakdown becomes dominated by microparticle processes so 
cleanliness and the absence of particulate contamination are absolutely essential in 
microwave tube applications where spacings are almost always greater than 2 mm. In 
any event, electrode spacing should be as large as possible without overly 
compromising the operation of the device. 
 
It has long been recognized that the choice of electrode material has a 
pronounced effect on breakdown voltage. It is generally agreed that, at one extreme 
there are materials like copper and nickel that are particularly susceptible to 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
720 
breakdown. At the other extreme, there are physically hard materials such as stainless 
steel, titanium, and molybdenum for which breakdown problems are minimized. 
However, hardness is not the only requirement because tungsten does not perform 
well. 
 
Other than hardness, a second significant property of âgoodâ electrode materials 
is their resistance to corrosion. The surfaces of these materials have a strong 
insulating oxide film, whereas, the surfaces of materials such as copper often have a 
semiconducting oxide film. While there is still controversy concerning breakdown 
mechanisms, these characteristics seem to be consistent with clump-initiated 
breakdown. For example, hard materials are less susceptible than soft materials to 
damage and the generation of secondary microparticles by impinging clumps. 
Semiconducting films are more likely to produce clump charging than insulating 
films. Increased clump charges result in increased clump velocities in the presence of 
high fields and increased surface damage on impact. 
 
Concerning surface preparation, historically, the ideal electrode surface has been 
thought to be one that is free from microprotrusions and microparticles. This indicates 
the need for a surface treatment that includes: 
 
 
1. 
A microscopic polishing procedure; 
 
2. 
A final cleaning treatment. 
 
Accordingly, the following procedures have historically been used to maximize 
breakdown voltage.   
 
â¢ 
Step 1: Take freshly machined electrodes and grind high-voltage surfaces 
with progressively finer grits. 
â¢ 
Step 2: After a thorough washing, polish to a 0.25-Î¼m finish. 
â¢ 
Step 3: Ultrasonic clean with a degreasing agent, acetone, methanol, and 
distilled water. 
 
Finally, great care must be taken to avoid recontamination during final assembly, so a 
clean room environment and procedures must be used. Still, surfaces prepared in this 
way will have a very complex surface microstructure so electrodes are often treated 
by using either a chemical or an electro-chemical polishing process. In addition, it has 
been shown that heating to ~ 1,100â1,200Â°C suppresses electron pinholes. (Of course, 
this is usually not possible with most microwave tube operations.) 
 
Electrode conditioning is used to safely quench as many as possible of the 
sources of prebreakdown current. The simplest and most widely used technique is 
current conditioning, which is particularly suitable for initial treatment of electron 
guns. A high voltage supply is used with a current-limiting resistor to increase voltage 
in small steps so that the prebreakdown current is stabilized in each step. The time 
profiles of current and voltage for a microdischarge that does not result in breakdown 
are shown in Figure 25-25.

As high voltage is gradually applied to the electrodes (Figure 25-26), 
microdischarges are produced that âclean upâ the electrodes. That is, 
microprotrusions are assumed to be thermally blunted or removed by the strong 
electromechanical forces. With a slowly increasing voltage, microparticles acquire a 
minimum charge and are not accelerated enough to cause breakdown. Instead, they 
are removed by continuous bouncing between electrodes or become welded to an 
electrode surface.

In a high-voltage device, this conditioning process must be carried out when 
voltage is first applied and then may have to be repeated in an accelerated manner 
each time the device is turned on. It should also be noted that, even for a newly 
conditioned gap, the voltage hold-off capability degrades with time, as is shown by 
Figure 25-27.

25.2.3   Vacuum Arcs 
 
Regardless of the initiation mechanism, dc breakdown in a vacuum leads to an arc on 
the negative electrode (at the current levels encountered under fault conditions in a 
microwave tube). This arc is normally known as a vacuum arc. 
 
In a vacuum arc, the material of the negative electrode is vaporized and ionized 
by arc spots to form a conducting medium between the electrodes. Vacuum arcs can 
be established on any reasonably good conductor. The voltage between electrodes 
during a vacuum arc varies little with electrode spacing for typical (cm) spacings and 
is essentially the cathode-fall potential. This is because there is no appreciable anode-
fall voltage and because the voltage drop in the plasma column is extremely small 
(~0.01 V/cm). The voltage drop is dependent on the material of the cathode and varies 
from 8 volts for mercury to 33 volts for cold steel. Figure 25-28 shows the 
relationship between the voltage at which a vacuum arc is sustained and the product 
of the boiling temperature and thermal conductivity of the cathode material. Barium is 
not included in this figure but is comparable to cadmium in arcing characteristics. As 
shown in Figure 25-29, the arcing voltage is a slowly varying function of current.

On a surface consisting of differing metals, a vacuum arc will operate on the low-
arcing voltage metals. For example, if a calcium film partially covers a copper 
surface, a vacuum arc will remove the calcium film before attacking the copper. This 
results from the relatively low arcing voltage of calcium (about 12V) relative to that 
of copper (about 20V). Similarly, the evaporation products from thermionic cathodes 
will be preferentially removed from nearby grid or control electrode surfaces by a 
vacuum arc. This is because barium, strontium, calcium, and so forth all have similar 
arcing voltages, which are about one-half (or less) of those of the normal materials of 
grids and electrodes. As a side note, arcing may produce deposition of material on 
critical surfaces such as insulators 
 
Unlike an arc in gas, which consists of one large spot anchored in position, many 
very small arc spots exist in a vacuum arc, as indicated in Figure 25-30. These spots 
travel at high speed (meters per second to tens of meters per second) with apparently 
random motion across the electrode surface. On a macroscopic scale, a surface 
subjected to prolonged vacuum arcing has the texture of a piece of frosted glass. On a 
microscopic scale, individual arc tracks somewhat resemble the tracks of insects 
crawling in random directions across a freshly painted surface.

It has been shown [11] that the cathode spot in the vacuum arc consists of a finite 
number of cells, each of which passes a current that is restricted to a narrow range of 
values. For example, Kesaev has shown that the current range of a cell in a mercury 
arc is approximately 0.08 to 0.1A. If the current through the arc is about 0.1A, then 
only one cell exists. If the current is raised above 0.1A, the cell divides into two cells. 
Further increases in current increase the number of cells until the total is equal to the 

Breakdown and Protection 
 
725 
current through the arc divided by the current per cell. If the current through a cell is 
reduced below about 0.08A, the cell extinguishes in a time that is thought to be less 
than 0.1 Î¼s. 
 
It is assumed that vacuum arcs on nearly all metals are cellular in nature. Possible 
exceptions are metals such as tungsten, which are capable of thermionic emission 
rates in excess of 106 A/cm2 at temperatures slightly above their boiling points (as 
calculated using the Richardson-Dushman equation and room-temperature values of 
work functions). At these high temperatures, the computed evaporation rates lead to 
mass-to-charge ratios that are near the value of 0.1 mg/Coulomb that is observed in 
vacuum-arc experiments. As a result, if it is assumed that the cellular nature of the arc 
is necessary for the intense emission rates to occur on low-temperature materials, then 
cells may not necessarily exist on some high boiling point materials. 
 
As the current through a vacuum arc is reduced, the number of cells decreases 
and the probability that all cells will extinguish simultaneously increases. As a result, 
the average arc lifetime becomes shorter and shorter. Figure 25-31 shows the 
interruption characteristics for several metals and shows, for example, that when the 
current through a tungsten (W) arc approaches 3A, the average lifetime approaches 
10 Î¼s.

When a vacuum arc extinguishes, it does so very rapidly. In fact, the current is 
said to âchop,â and the chopping time is usually less than 0.1 Î¼s. The chopping 
characteristics of vacuum arcs are important to the designer of protection circuitry 
that is used with microwave tubes to prevent damage to the tube in the event that an 
arc occurs. For example, as the current is driven toward zero by a protection circuit, 
the arc will extinguish well before the current reaches zero. If there is significant 
inductance in the protection circuitry, the voltage generated by an arc that chops can 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
726 
be sufficient to cause insulation failure. 
 
The rate at which material is removed from a surface by a vacuum arc varies 
somewhat from metal to metal but is generally about 0.1 mg per Coulomb of charge 
passed through the arc. Thus, if the time history of the current in a tube during an arc 
is known, the amount of erosion can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. 
 
Similarly, if energy input to an arc in an electron gun is known, the erosion can 
be estimated. This is because the arcing voltage is restricted to a reasonably narrow 
range of values. For example, if a 20J arc occurs, the charge passed through the arc is 
estimated to be 1C using an average arcing voltage of 20V. For 1C of charge, 0.1 mg 
of material is removed. For a density of 10 gm/cm3 (typical for most electron-gun 
metals), the volume of electrode material removed is 10â5 cm3. For a 1 cm2 area of 
electrode material, the thickness removed is only 10â5 cm or 0.1 Î¼m. Thus, the 
amount of material removed by a 1C or a 20J arc is extremely small. 
 
Unfortunately, the small amount of material removed by the 20J arc is not the 
only factor that must be considered. If the surfaces on which the vaporized arc 
material deposits are critical, such as insulators, leakage currents or insulator 
breakdown may result. Furthermore, gas molecules on the arced surfaces or nearby 
surfaces may be driven off by the arc, producing a gas burst. As an example, the 
release of a monolayer of gas from 1 cm2 of area into a volume of 1 liter raises the 
pressure from 10â6 to 10â4 torr. This gas must be removed (by adsorption, an 
appendage pump, or a getter) before tube operation can be resumed. 
 
The maximum permissible energy input during an arc in the gun is sometimes 
specified by the manufacturer. This energy is based largely on the manufacturerâs 
experience. Maximum permissible energy levels from joules to tens of joules are not 
uncommon. Knowing the maximum permissible energy level, it is then possible for 
the tube user to design a protection circuit to interrupt the flow of energy before it 
becomes excessive. 
 
Once a vacuum arc has extinguished, the voltage recovery rate can be extremely 
rapid. The recovery rate depends on the duration and intensity of the arc; however, a 
value of 10 kV/Î¼s is not uncommon. Thus, it is often necessary to cause only a very 
brief interruption of current through a vacuum arc before voltage is reapplied to the 
electrodes. In fact, this principle has been used in the development of vacuum arc 
interrupters [12]. 
 
 
25.3   DC BREAKDOWN ON INSULATOR SURFACES 
 
One of the weakest points in a vacuum device from an electrical breakdown point of 
view is the interface between a metal, an insulator, and a vacuum. This interface is 
often called the triple junction, and is illustrated in Figure 25-32. Because of electron 
launching mechanisms at the triple junction and surface effects on the insulator, the 
breakdown strength of the insulator (actually, breakdown of the insulator surface) is 
well below that of a vacuum gap or a solid insulator of equivalent length. Shannon, 

Breakdown and Protection 
 
727 
Philip, and Trump suggested that through proper design, insulators in vacuum without 
conditioning should achieve 50 kV/cm, and conditioned insulators should be operable 
at 80 kV/cm [13].

At the triple junction there are at least two situations that might initiate 
breakdown. In one, the insulator is brazed to the metal surface. In the process of 
metallizing the surface of the insulator and brazing it to metal, it is virtually 
impossible to avoid the formation of a fillet of braze material on the surface of the 
insulator. This fillet has a razor-sharp edge with a high field enhancement factor. 
When voltage is applied, the high field can cause microprotuberances to grow, which 
further increases in the enhancement factor so field emission and, possibly, the 
generation of microparticles  occur at relatively low voltages. 
 
The second situation is when the insulator is mechanically held in place but not 
brazed. Then there are voids between the insulator and the metal along the triple 
junction. The effect of a void on equipotential surfaces is shown in Figure 25-33. The 
field enhancement factor in these voids may be as high as the relative dielectric 
constant of the insulator. For aluminum oxide, which is commonly used in these 
situations, the relative dielectric constant is about 9. This field enhancement factor, 
coupled with those of microprotuberances, is thought to lead to field emission and, 
possibly,  microparticle generation.

The second step in insulator flashover is thought to be positive charging of the 
insulator in the vicinity of the triple junction. This occurs, as indicated in Figure 
25-34, because electrons that are field emitted from the triple junction strike the 
insulator surface causing secondary emission to occur. The secondary emission 
coefficient for most insulating materials is relatively high (values from 5 to 10 are 
common, especially if the primary electrons strike the surface at a grazing angle).

The secondary emission process is regenerative in that the secondary electrons 
are accelerated by the field at the surface to produce additional secondaries. The result 
is that the insulator surface becomes positively charged in the triple junction region, 
and this increases the field and the rate of electron emission at the triple junction. 
 
The next phase in the flashover process is thought to be desorption of gas 
molecules from the insulator surface and subsequent ionization as indicated in Figure 
25-34. The positive ions are accelerated toward the cathode where they further 
enhance the field and, as a result, increase electron emission. Other processes possibly 
involving photon emission are thought to occur, and the result is rapid breakdown 
across the insulator surface. 
 
The techniques that have been investigated for suppressing insulator flashover 
center on the prevention of the initial charging of the insulator in the region of the 
triple junction. As shown in Figure 25-35, if the angle of contact of the insulator with 
the electrode surface is about 45 degrees, the insulator flashover potential is about 5 
times the flashover potential for normal incidence. The reason for this is thought to be 
that, since the electric fields are normal to the emitting electrode, electrons emitted at 
the triple junction are accelerated normal to the electrode. As a result, they donât 
strike the insulator surface. 
 
It is common in microwave tubes to reduce the field at the triple junction by 
shaping the metal electrodes in this region. An example of the design for a high-
voltage electron gun is shown in Figure 25-36. Notice that the triple junctions are 
almost completely shielded from equipotential surfaces.

25.4   RF BREAKDOWN IN VACUUM 
 
Kilpatrickâs criterion, discussed in Section 25.2, is often used as a guideline to the 
maximum RF voltage that can be applied between electrodes. Very often, however, 
another kind of discharge develops at voltage levels well below the Kilpatrick level. 
This discharge is called a multipactor discharge. In its simplest form, this discharge 
occurs when electrons move back and forth between two electrodes in synchronism 
with an RF field. As indicated in Figure 25-37, if the secondary emission coefficient 
of the electrodes is greater than unity (to be more specific, if the product of the 
secondary emission coefficients of the two electrodes is greater than unity), then the 
number of electrons involved in the process builds up with time. Many multipacting 
modes other than that shown in Figure 25-37 are possible. These will be described in 
this section.

Figure 25-37   Illustration of simple two-surface multipactor. 
 
 
During multipacting, large amounts of energy can be discharged in a small 
volume with the result that electrodes or RF windows can be damaged or destroyed. 
Even if excessive damage does not occur, multipacting can load an RF circuit so that 
the output power is reduced and modulated with a noiselike signal. 
 
The phenomenon of secondary electron resonance, or multipactor, was first 
recognized and described by Farnsworth 75 years ago [14]. His primary interest in 
multipactor was its use in amplifying devices. With the exception of Vaughanâs report 
in 1988 [15], not much has been published about multipactor in microwave tubes. As 
noted by Preist [16], âThere is likewise very little to be heard on the subject of fleas, 
perhaps for the same reason, that undue familiarity with the subject may be taken to 
mean that one has problems.â Still, as pointed out by Vaughan, multipactor is present 
in one form or another in nearly all high-power microwave tubes; often it is 
observable but harmless, occasionally beneficial, and sometimes disastrous. Thus, it is 
very important for microwave tube engineers to understand multipactor and the 
approaches and techniques that can be taken to control or eliminate it. In this section, 
multipacting modes are described along with some specific corrective actions that 
have been taken to eliminate multipactor. 
 
25.4.1   Two-Surface Multipactor with No Magnetic Field 
 
The theory of two-surface electric-field multipactor has been presented in various 
reports. The results given here were reported by Vaughan [15]. The configuration that 
he considered consists of two parallel electrodes driven by an RF voltage as shown in 
Figure 25-38.  
 
Whether or not multipacting occurs depends primarily on the peak RF voltage, 
the frequency of the RF and the gap width. There are several combinations (zones) of 
voltage, frequency and gap width that can produce a multipactor discharge. In the N = 
1 zone, electrons move back and forth between the surfaces in synchronism with each 
half cycle of the alternating RF. In the N = 3 zone, the electron transit time across the 
gap corresponds to 3/2 cycle of the applied RF voltage. This means that electrons start 
across the gap, stop and reverse direction of travel as the RF voltage reverses polarity, 
and then stop and reverse direction of travel again when the voltage reverses polarity 
before finally landing on the opposing electrode. In the N = 5 zone, the electron transit 
time across the gap corresponds to 5/2 cycle of the applied RF voltage.

The conditions that produce three of the multipactor zones are shown in Figure 
25-39. For each zone, approximate contours of constant impact voltage are indicated 
by dashed lines. The lowest impact voltage is 100V. This is because, as Figure 25-40 
shows, the secondary emission coefficient for typical materials drops below unity at 
impact energy levels below about 100 eV and so multipactor does not occur. At high 
impact voltages, the energy level at which the secondary emission ratio drops below 
unity is highly dependent on the angle of incidence of the impacting electrons. As 
shown in Figure 25-40, for normal incidence, the value is about 2,500 eV. The curve 
for impact at about 55Â° shows that the secondary emission coefficient drops below 
unity well above 4,000 eV. 
 
For some forms of multipactor to be discussed later, the impact angle can 
approach 90Â° from normal. The energy of these electrons can be almost unlimited and 
the secondary emission coefficient will still be above unity. 
 
The power level of the simple multipactor discussed in the previous paragraphs is 
usually too low to cause physical damage to the electrodes. However, the power level 
is sufficient to cause RF loading and, as a result, degradation of tube performance. 
 
Vaughan points out that there are few general methods for suppressing 
multipactor. In general, a technique that employs a change in geometry or a change in 
operating conditions is preferred to one that is based on a surface treatment (such as a 
low secondary emission coating). This is because the change in geometry or operating 
conditions usually provides a permanent solution, whereas the surface treatment may 
deteriorate with time resulting in the return of conditions favorable to a multipactor. 
 
An example of a geometrical solution is the one used in the output cavities of 
some klystrons. There, multipactor can occur between the drift tube tips as indicated 
in Figure 25-41. By cutting axial slots (sometimes referred to as fluting or serrating) 
the drift tube tips, the multipactor discharge can be suppressed. The reason is that the 
effective secondary emission coefficient of the drift tube tips is reduced to a value 
below unity. This occurs because many of the secondaries produced by the impacting 
electrons that fall into the slots are trapped in the slots.

25.4.2   Two-Surface Multipactor in Combined Fields  
 
When a transverse magnetic field is imposed on the parallel-plate electrode 
configuration considered Section 25.4.1, the electrons are deflected from straight-line 
paths to the curved trajectories shown in Figure 25-42. The most significant aspect of 
the change in trajectory shape is that the electrons can impact on the electrodes at an 
angle that can approach 90Â° from normal incidence. Thus, referring back to Figure 
25-40, it is possible to see that the energies of the electrons can be tens of thousands 
of electron volts and the secondary emission coefficient of the surface will still remain 
above unity. Thus, the crossed-field multipactor can be a very high voltage and high-
power discharge.

Maximum secondary emission will occur when electron impact is tangential to 
the electrode surfaces and this is when we would expect the crossed-field discharge to 
be most intense. This will occur when an electron reaches the top of a cycloidal orbit 
in one-half cycle of the applied frequency and this, in turn, occurs when the applied 
frequency is equal to the cyclotron frequency, that is, when

Vaughan [17] reported the case of crossed-field multipactor in the impedance 
transformer of a magnetron, the configuration of which is shown in Figure 25-43. It 
was thought that electrons generated by the multipactor at point A and missing the 
transformer surface at point B continued on to strike the window at point C causing 
window failure.

The measured magnetic field in the region of the multipactor was 1,000 gauss 
and so the cyclotron frequency was 2,800 MHz. The operating frequency of the tube 
was 2,770 MHz and so it was nearly equal to the cyclotron frequency. X-ray 
photographs and good agreement between calculated impact velocities and observed 
X-ray hardness strongly indicated that the multipactor configuration was as shown in 
Figure 25-43. 
 
The crossed-field multipactor was virtually eliminated by reducing the magnetic 
field in the region of the transformer by 90%. Vaughan also noted a substantial 
reduction in the intensity of the discharge when the gas pressure in the tubes was 
reduced. This was attributed to a reduction in ion formation in the multipactor 
discharge. It is thought that these ions neutralized the electron space charge forces in 
the discharge and so it was more intense than when the ions were absent.

25.4.3   Single-Surface Multipactor with No Magnetic Field 
 
In the absence of a magnetic field, a multipactor discharge can occur on a single 
dielectric surface as is indicated in Figure 25-44 [16]. A dielectric is required because 
there must be a component of the electric field parallel to the surface. Electrons 
emitted from the surface (indicated by the vectors labeled with vo in Figure 25-44) 
have a component of velocity perpendicular to the surface. The electric field 
accelerates the electrons in the direction parallel to the surface and, in the absence of 
any force toward the surface, the electrons drift away, as indicated by trajectories 1 
and 2.

Preist, Proc. 4th International Congress on Microwave Tubes, 1963.) 
 
 
If there is a force toward the dielectric surface, then electrons follow trajectories 
like 3 and 4 in Figure 25-44 and strike the surface. For electrons with sufficient 
energy and a surface with a secondary emission coefficient greater than unity, one or 
more secondaries will be emitted for each primary. Each of these can follow a 
trajectory like that shown in Figure 25-45 and produce additional secondaries. As a 
result, a multipactor discharge can build up on the dielectric surface and cause heating 
and failure of the dielectric. 
 
The force shown in Figure 25-44 can arise when electrons (from a source such as 
the two-surface multipactor shown in Figure 25-43) strike the dielectric surface and 
cause electrons to be emitted. If the secondary emission coefficient is greater than 
unity, more electrons will leave the surface than arrive at it and so the surface will 
become positively charged. Thus, a force is generated that may enable the multipactor 
discharge to build up.

It should be noted that, unlike the two-surface multipactor discharges, there is no 
requirement with the single-surface discharge for a definite transit angle. Thus, the 
single-surface multipactor can exist over a large range of electric field strengths as 
long as the field is sufficient to accelerate electrons to impact velocities high enough 
so that the secondary emission coefficient is greater than unity. 
 
The secondary emission coefficients of all of the dielectric materials used in 
microwave tubes is greater than unity. To suppress multipactor, it has been necessary 
to coat the dielectrics with low secondary yield films. Titanium-based films have been 
successfully used for this purpose [16, 18].

25.4.4   Single-Surface Multipactor in Combined Fields 
 
An example of single-surface multipactor in combined fields on a metallic surface is 
shown in Figure 25-46 and an example on a dielectric surface is given in Figure 
25-47. The electron trajectory shown in Figure 25-46 was computer generated [15]. 
This single-surface multipactor was observed using an X-ray pinhole camera in the 
output gap of a high-power klystron. The computation showed that electrons were 
leaving the cavity surface and returning one RF period later under the influence of the 
magnetic focusing field and the RF electric field. The electrons impinged tangentially 
on the cavity surface with an energy of about 35 keV to points displaced about 35Â° 
around the axis from their starting points. Thus, the whole discharge was rotating 
about the axis of the cavity. In the report of this multipactor [15] no technique was 
described for suppressing the discharge. 
 
The multipactor shown in Figure 25-47 occurred on the inner surface of a 
dielectric cylinder used in the cavities of some klystrons [16]. This discharge is 
similar to the single- surface multipactor that occurs on a dielectric in the absence of a 
magnetic field. When the magnetic field is present, the force driving the electrons 
toward the surface of the dielectric is provided by the magnetic field in conjunction 
with the component of the initial electron velocity normal to the surface. The most 
intense discharge occurs when the cyclotron frequency is equal to the radio 
frequency. Magnetic fields stronger than the cyclotron field tend to prevent this form 
of multipactor.

25.5   RF BREAKDOWN OF INSULATORS 
 
The multipactor discharges on dielectrics described in the previous section are 
discharges that occur on a surface. They may produce heating of the surface and that, 
in turn, may result in cracking and insulation failure. Vaughan [19] described another 
cause of window cracking that results from arcing to a conductive deposit on the 
vacuum side of the window. This problem was eliminated by preventing the 
formation of the conductive deposit. 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
738 
 
Vaughan [19] has also described window punctures that resulted from the 
combined actions of an RF electric field and dc window charging on electrons 
deposited on the surface of a window. The window configuration was that shown in 
Figure 25-43 and the source of electrons was the crossed-field multipactor that 
occurred in the magnetron impedance transformer. The windows were generally 
observed to be charged positively between 5 and 12 kV on the outside. As a result, 
there was an electrostatic field of about 50 kV/cm through the window. Vaughan 
postulated that electrons striking the window formed a small cavity in the window 
surface and that the field at the tip of this cavity enhanced the electrostatic field in the 
window. The resulting dc force attracting electrons into the window, coupled with RF 
forces (produced by the RF electric field component parallel to the window surface) 
causing the electrons to oscillate sideways, produced a disintegrating action that 
resulted in electrons burrowing through the window. The result was the formation of 
a pinhole with a diameter on the order of 10 Î¼m. This failure mode was eliminated by 
suppressing the crossed-field multipactor, which was the source of the electrons that 
initiated the failure process. 
 
 
25.6   DC BREAKDOWN IN GAS [20â22] 
 
Electrical discharges in gases are extremely complex. Several different types of 
discharges can exist, depending on the current and voltage applied to the gas. These 
various discharge types are indicated in Figure 25-48. Current and relative voltages 
shown in Figure 25-48 are representative values only and depend on factors such as 
gas type and the area of the electrodes used during testing.

Breakdown and Protection 
 
739 
 
When breakdown occurs, the discharge rapidly increases in intensity. Depending 
on circuit conditions (voltage and impedance), either a glow discharge or an arc may 
develop.  
 
The breakdown voltage depends on the ease with which the gas is ionized and on 
the effectiveness of the ions in producing electrons when they strike the negative 
electrode. As a result, the breakdown voltage is a function of gas type and pressure, 
and electrode spacing and material. 
 
The breakdown voltage is normally plotted in the manner shown in Figure 25-49. 
Breakdown voltage plots of this type are referred to as Paschen characteristics 
because of Paschenâs law, which states that, for parallel plane electrodes in a 
particular gas at a particular temperature, the breakdown voltage is a function of the 
product of the gas pressure and the electrode spacing. 
 
The shapes of the Paschen characteristics may be explained as follows: to the left 
of the minimum, the breakdown voltage increases as pressure and density decrease 
(with fixed electrode spacing). This is because the gas molecules are farther apart, and 
more electrons travel through the gas without producing ionization. In the limit, under 
high-vacuum conditions, there is essentially no ionization. Breakdown occurs because 
of electrode phenomena. DC breakdown in a vacuum is discussed in Section 25.2.

To the right of the Paschen minimum, the breakdown voltage increases as 
pressure and gas density increase. In this case, gas molecules are closer together, and 
so a large electric field is required to give the electrons enough energy in the short 
distances between collisions to produce ionization. Thus, the breakdown voltage is 
high. At atmospheric pressure and above, the breakdown voltage for a 1-cm gap can 
be several tens and even hundreds of thousands of volts. 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
740 
 
At intermediate pressures and electrode spacings, optimum conditions for 
ionization occur, and so there is a minimum in the Paschen curve. The minimum 
breakdown voltage for most gases is a few hundred volts and occurs at pressure Ã 
distance (torr-cm) near unity. 
 
Breakdown voltages for several gases are listed in Table 25.1. The values given 
were obtained with a 1-cm gap at the Paschen minimum (the critical pressure-spacing 
product) and at atmospheric pressure. It should be noted that the freons and sulphur 
hexafluoride have high-breakdown voltages. These gases are referred to as 
electronegative gases. Their molecules require one or two electrons to fill the outer 
shell. As a result, they can easily capture free electrons and this results in the high-
breakdown voltages for these gases. 
 
Electronegative gases are expensive and tend to be somewhat hazardous, and so 
they are often mixed with more common gases such as air or dry nitrogen. As shown 
in Figure 25-50, even a small amount of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) in nitrogen 
significantly increases breakdown voltage. 
 
The power supply or modulator for a microwave tube is normally capable of 
delivering a short-circuit current of at least several amperes and sometimes several 
kiloamperes. As a result, when breakdown occurs, a glow discharge rapidly 
transitions to an arc. Depending on the arc voltage and arc duration, damage can be 
significant.

The arc voltage depends on the voltage gradient of the arc column, which is 
largely dependent on gas type, arc current, and pressure. The arc-column voltage 
gradients for several common gases at atmospheric pressure are given in Figure 
25-51. The combination of the column gradient of a few tens of volts/cm with the 
electrode drops results in arc voltages in roughly the 50- to 100-V range for arcs of 
average length (a few centimeters).

At the end of Section 25.3, estimates are made of the energy and charge levels at 
which excessive damage may occur during a dc arc inside the vacuum envelope of a 
tube. Unfortunately, it is not so easy to make comparable estimates for dc arcs outside 
the vacuum envelope. If the arc occurs between bare electrodes, it is possible that a 
substantial amount of energy (hundreds of joules or more) can be dissipated without 
causing excessive damage. If, however, the arc occurs in the vicinity of an insulating 
material, it is possible that the material may be damaged with only a few joules of 
energy dissipation. 
 
 
25.7   RF BREAKDOWN IN GAS [21] 
 
In the previous section, it was shown that the dc breakdown field for air at 
atmospheric pressure is about 30 kV/cm. At low frequencies (up to tens of Hz), the 
breakdown field remains at 30 kV/cm. As frequency is increased to the audio range 
and then into the RF range, the breakdown field drops and becomes highly dependent 
on frequency and electrode spacing, as well as pressure. 
 
The unified plot given in Figure 25-52 was developed by Woo [23] for 50-â¦ 
coaxial transmission lines and gives breakdown power as functions of frequency, 
pressure, and spacing under laboratory conditions. This plot appears complex at first 
glance, but it is relatively straightforward once a person becomes familiar with it.

kV/cm. The characteristic diffusion length in Figures 25-53 and 25-54 is a measure of 
the size and shape of the cavity in which the measurements were made.

The information in Figures 25-52, 25-53, and 25-54 would lead one to believe 
that extremely high-power levels can be transmitted through waveguides and coaxial 
lines of relatively modest size. For example, an extrapolation of Wooâs unified plots 
to atmospheric pressure in a 7/8-inch coaxial line and a frequency of 1 GHz indicates 
that the breakdown power is about 200 kW. Still, as shown in Figure 25-55, the 
power ratings for a standard 7/8-inch coaxial line are 43 kW peak and only about 
1,250W average. Some of the degradation results from field enhancement associated 
with supporting elements for the center conductor. More important, for the average 
power case, heating, especially of the center conductor and gas, is a major factor 
limiting the power rating. 
 
A situation similar to that in coaxial lines exists in waveguides as shown in 
Figure 25-56. The ratings in the lefthand plot are for a conductor temperature rise of 
42.4Â°C, and those for the righthand plot are for a temperature rise of 110Â°C. Based on 
a breakdown field of 20 kV/cm, it would be expected that WR 90, which has a small 
dimension of about 1 cm, should be able to transmit megawatts of power. Instead, the 
rating is in the kilowatt range. 
 
The power ratings for the waveguides in Figure 25-56 decrease by a factor of 
about three when the conductor temperature rise increases from 42.4Â°C to 110Â°C. Part 
of this decrease in rating may be attributed to the decrease in gas density in the 
waveguide as temperature is increased while pressure is held constant. This is 
equivalent to moving to the left in the high pressure region on the Paschen curve 
toward lower breakdown voltages. The reduction in pressure at constant temperature 
in moving to the left on the Paschen curve is equivalent to a reduction in gas density. 
This reduction in power capability with temperature is illustrated more clearly in 
Figure 25-57.

As would be expected, a change in pressure in a waveguide or a coaxial line has 
an extremely large effect on power handling capability. As an example, the change in 
pressure from sea level to about 50,000 ft is given in Figure 25-58, and the 
corresponding reduction in waveguide power capacity is shown in Figure 25-59. Note 
that at 50,000 ft, the power capacity drops to about 3% of the sea level capacity. If an 
RF system is pressurized, a significant increase in power handling capability can be 
realized as shown in Figure 25-60.

In Section 25.7, the use of electronegative gases for increasing breakdown 
voltage was discussed. As shown in Figure 25-61, similar improvements are possible 
in RF components. The improvement in power handling capability with pure sulphur 
hexafluoride (SF6) at a pressure of 20 psi is a factor of about 16. Even a small 
percentage of SF6 mixed with air produces a significant increase in power capability. 
Other electronegative gases such as freon 12 and freon 114 produce similar 
improvements in power handling capability.

In pulsed RF systems, the peak power capability increases for at least two 
reasons. The first has already been pointed out in connection with Figure 25-55. That 
is, the heating effect is decreased. The other reason is based on the fact that it takes 
time for a gas to break down. First, there is the time required for the breakdown 
process to start. This is called the formative time. Second, there is the time required 
for the discharge to develop to the point where appreciable RF power is absorbed or 
reflected. 
 
The formative time for air can be determined from Figure 25-62. Here, P is gas 
pressure, E is electric field, and Ï is the formative time. For a 1-Î¼s pulse, and 
atmospheric pressure, the PÏ product is slightly less than 10â3 torr-sec, which is near 
the right side of Figure 25-62. Thus, at pulse lengths substantially shorter than 1 Î¼s, 
the formative time is long enough that the breakdown field increases. An example of 
the dependence of breakdown power on pulsewidth is given in Figure 25-63. Note 
that the reduction in power capability when the pulse length is increased from 1 to 3 
Î¼s is about 30%.

The voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) in the RF output system of a tube may 
cause breakdown to occur. The reason for this is, of course, that the reflected wave 
adds to the forward wave to produce regions of increased field level. A VSWR of 
1.5:1 reduces the breakdown power by 35%, and 2:1 reduces breakdown power by 
50%. If a system must be designed for operation with a significant VSWR, then the 
normal waveguide or coaxial line rating must be reduced to prevent breakdown as 
indicated by Figure 25-64.

If breakdown does occur in the RF output system connected to a microwave 
tube, it is probable that the resulting arc will reflect most of the incident power back 
toward the tube. As a result, the VSWR will be very high and may produce 
breakdown at other points along the RF system, as is indicated in Figure 25-65. In this 
case, an arc at plane I produces a standing wave and causes the electric field to exceed 
the breakdown level of a critical element such as the output window of a tube located 
at plane IV.

An isolator is often used to protect a microwave tube from excessive reflected 
RF power. The isolator may also impede or even stop a traveling arc. The effect of a 
ferrite isolator on VSWR is shown in Figure 25-66. While the isolator is effective in 
protecting the tube, it will not prevent arcing in the remainder of the RF system. 
 
In some microwave systems, an attempt is made to reduce arcing problems and 
arc damage by using a detector of some type. Reflected power can be sensed with a 
directional coupler and measured with a threshold detector that generates a signal to 
turn off the microwave tube if excessive reflections occur. 
 
A waveguide arc can be sensed by detecting visible arcs. The sensing portion of 
the detector is usually mounted in a 90Â° waveguide bend located between the tube 
output flange and the waveguide transmission line. The output signal from the sensing 
device is normally used to turn off the high-power tube. 
 
In another technique sometimes used to protect an output window, a metal probe 
is inserted through, but insulated from, the waveguide near the output window. When 
an arc occurs and moves toward the window, the electrical circuit between the probe 
and the waveguide is closed, so that a relay can be activated to turn off the tube.

25.8   FAULT DETECTION AND TUBE PROTECTION 
 
There are several types of faults that occur in microwave tubes. Two that often occur 
are: 
 
 
1. 
Excess body (interception) current; 
 
2. 
Excess reflected RF power. 
 
 
Excess body current can result from an arc in the gun or from any one of many 
factors that upset the electron beam dynamics and cause too much of the beam to 
strike the RF circuit or the anode of the electron gun. Excess reflected RF power is 
normally caused by a problem in the RF circuit attached to the output of the tube. 
Even though the tube is often not at fault, excess reflected power may cause it to fail 
and so the tube must be protected. 
 
25.8.1   Excess Body Current 
 
The most common location for an arc in a microwave tube is in the electron gun and 
the arc that is formed is a vacuum arc. There is also the possibility that an arc may 
occur outside the vacuum envelope in the gun region. When an arc occurs, excess 
current flows to the gun anode (or to the anode lead outside the vacuum envelope) 
and, if the anode is connected to the body of the tube (as it often is), then the current 
returns to the power supply through the tube body and so the current is referred to as 
body current.

Body current caused by an arc is usually distinguishable from body current 
caused by beam interception because it is usually much larger in magnitude and 
occurs much more rapidly. In designing circuits that will protect a tube from excess 
body current, it is necessary to design for the fast rising, large amplitude current of the 
arc as well as for the (usually) more gradual increase of beam interception current to 
an unacceptable level. The more difficult aspect of the circuit design is usually the arc 
protection part and that is what we will concentrate on here. In designing arc detection 
and tube protection circuits, the two arc characteristics that must be known are: 
 
 
1. 
Arc voltage; 
 
2. 
Maximum permissible arc energy. 
 
Early in this section it was shown that the arc voltage for an arc in air is about 50V. In 
Section 25.3, it was noted that the voltage of a vacuum arc can range from 8V for 
mercury to 33V for cold steel. The average voltage for most commonly used metals is 
about 20V. To be safe, the protection circuitry should be designed for the higher 
voltage (50V) arc. 
 
The energy, Wa, delivered to an arc is, of course, the product of the power to the 
arc, Pa, and the duration of the arc, Ïa so 
 
 
 
a

W   P Ï

Knowing the circuit design for the tube power supply, Ia can be calculated and so the 
duration of the arc, Ïa, must be limited by the protection circuitry to limit arc energy to 
the specified level. That is, the protection circuitry must respond in time

For example, if the maximum arc energy specification is 2 joules and the short-circuit

supply using large filter capacitors is used), then 
 
 
 
40 Î¼s
a 
 
Ï

(25-17) 
Thus, the time response requirement on the protection circuitry is usually very 
modest. In fact, arc energies can easily be limited to a small fraction of a joule by 
limiting short circuit current and using a switching circuit that reacts within a few 
microseconds.

25.8.2   Excess Reflected RF Power 
 
Figure 25-67 shows some of the elements of an RF system that can cause excessive 
reflected RF power. In the cases shown, an impedance mismatch occurs because of a 
mechanical problem in the RF system. Arcing in the output RF system can also 
produce a very large impedance mismatch and almost total power reflection. 
 
If the power reflection occurs on the output side of the isolator and the isolator is 
not defective then the reflected power will not reach the tube and thus, of course, the 
tube will be protected. Usually, a directional coupler (which is not shown in Figure 
25-67) is used to measure reflected power and turn off the system in the event of 
excessive reflected power.  
 
If the power reflection occurs on the input side of the isolator, or the isolator is 
defective (or there is no isolator and no directional coupler for measuring reflected 
power), then excessive power may reach the microwave tube. This may cause failure 
of the output window or failure of internal tube elements such as the attenuator in a 
traveling wave tube. In some systems an optical detector is placed in the RF output 
line near the tube window to shut the system off if an arc occurs.

Vacuum Technology 
 
 
If a microwave tube is to operate properly, a high or ultrahigh vacuum must be 
maintained throughout its life. As a result, special techniques, processes, and 
materials must be used. The emphasis in this appendix is on vacuum technology. 
Subjects discussed are: 
 
 
â¢ 
Units of measurement; 
 
â¢ 
Ranges of operation; 
 
â¢ 
Sources of gas;

â¢

â¢

â¢ 
Microwave tube materials; 
 
â¢ 
Fabrication techniques. 
 
 
Several excellent books on vacuum technology are listed with the references at the 
end of this appendix [1â11]. 
 
 
B.1   UNITS OF MEASUREMENT 
 
Many years ago, the most commonly used unit of pressure was the millimeter of 
mercury (mmHg). Atmospheric pressure is 760 mmHg. Now, the accepted units of 
pressure are the torr and the newton/m2 (pascal). The relation between these units 
is 
1 torr â 1 mmHg â 1.33Ã 102 pascal 
 
Another unit of pressure sometimes used at relatively low vacuum (high 
pressure) levels is the micron: 
1 micron = 10â6 meters of Hg = 10â3 mmHg â 10â3 torr 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
760 
 
Still another unit of pressure used in European literature is the mbar 
(millibar): 
1.33 mbar = 1 torr 
 
 
In microwave tube work, it is rarely and perhaps never necessary to know 
pressure to an accuracy better than a factor of two or so. As a result, it is safe to 
remember that 
1 torr â 1 mmHg â 1 mbar 
 
 
B.2   RANGES OF OPERATION 
 
In evacuating a microwave tube, the pressure changes from atmospheric to a value 
as low as 10â8 to 10â9 torr or lower. Thus, the pressure is reduced by over eleven 
orders of magnitude. It is common to divide this very wide pressure variation into 
four ranges:  
 
â¢ 
760 torr to ~1 torr 
â 
 
Rough vacuum 
â¢ 
1 torr to ~10â3 torr 
â 
 
Medium vacuum 
â¢ 
10â3 torr to ~10â7 torr 
â 
 
High vacuum 
â¢ 
< 10â7 torr  
â 
 
Ultrahigh vacuum 
 
In most electron tubes, the pressure is at the low end of the high vacuum range or 
the high end of the ultrahigh vacuum range (i.e., from 10â7 to 10â9 torr). In some 
high-power klystrons that have been in operation for > 50,000 hrs, the pressure is 
even lower. 
 
At atmospheric pressure, the gas density is about 2.7Ã1019 molecules/cm3. As 
shown in Figure B-1, density drops linearly with decreasing pressure and, at 10â8 
torr, is about 3Ã108 molecules/cm3. While this density appears to be high, 3Ã108 
molecules will form a monolayer on an area of only 10â6 cm 2. The time required to 
form a monolayer is also shown in Figure B-1. At a pressure of 10â8 torr, a 
monolayer is formed in a about 3 min. 
 
Mean free path length is the mean distance traveled by a molecule between 
collisions. Figure B-1 shows that, at 10â8 torr, the mean free path length is ~104 m. 
So the average molecule could pass through a 1-m vacuum chamber 10,000 times 
without colliding with another molecule. At 1 torr however, the mean free path 
length is ~10â4-m so molecules collide with each other more frequently than with 
the walls of a vacuum system. 
 
At relatively high pressures, where molecules collide with each other far more 
frequently than with vacuum chamber walls, gas flow is referred to as viscous 
flow. At low pressures, where molecules collide with vacuum system walls more 
frequently than with each other, gas flow is referred to as molecular flow. In the 

Appendix B  Vacuum Technology 
 
761 
viscous flow and molecular flow regions, the analysis of gas flow is relatively 
straightforward. In the pressure range from ~10â2 torr to 10â4 torr, a transition from 
viscous to molecular flow occurs, and gas flow behavior is difficult to analyze. 
 
The effects of viscous and molecular flow in vacuum system design are 
illustrated in Figure B-2. In the viscous flow region, molecules gradually migrate 
in the direction of the pump because of the change in pressure, ÎP. With 
molecular flow, molecules collide only with the walls of the chamber and only 
occasionally are directed toward the pump. As a result, a large pump orifice is 
required if a high pump speed is to be achieved. For example, if 1-inch (2.5-cm) 
tubulation was used to connect the vacuum system to the pump, the speed would 
be limited to a few liters per second. If a 6-inch (15-cm) diameter orifice was used, 
the speed could be well over 1,000 liters per second.

B.3   SOURCES OF GAS 
 
If the only gas source in a container that is to be evacuated is the gas located in the 
volume of the container, then the container could be pumped out very quickly. In 
addition, if the pump being used is a âperfect pumpâ that is, regardless of pressure, 
the pumping speed is unchanged and the pump contributed no gas to the system, 
then the ultimate pressure would be unlimited. Unfortunately, there are many gas 
sources in any container that is to be evacuated and there is no perfect pump. The 
gas sources are identified in Figure B-3 and described next.

B.3.1   Backstreaming 
 
Backstreaming is the transport of gas from a vacuum pump back into the chamber 
being pumped. Perhaps the best examples of pumps for which backstreaming is 
sometimes a problem are the oil-sealed mechanical pump and the diffusion pump. 
The oil in the mechanical pump vaporizes and the oil molecules can diffuse 
throughout the vacuum system being pumped. In the diffusion pump, oil is the 
working fluid that produces the pumping action, but the oil vapors can diffuse 
toward the system being pumped. When either or both of these pumps are used, 

Appendix B  Vacuum Technology 
 
763 
backstreaming occurs. The backstreaming gas consists of molecules of the 
pumping fluid and its fractions. A baffle can be used between the pump and the 
chamber being evacuated to reduce backstreaming, but still some molecules of 
pumping fluid migrate to the chamber being evacuated. 
 
B.3.2   Permeation 
 
Permeation results from an electronic interaction between a gas and a solid. This 
interaction results in the movement of gas molecules from atom to atom through 
the solid. The rate of gas flow due to permeation depends on the gas and the solid 
and varies by orders of magnitude with different gas-solid combinations. 
Permeations for several gas-metal systems are shown in Figure B-4. 
 
The only appreciable permeation rate of interest for vacuum-tube design is 
hydrogen through iron and iron alloys. Iron is part of the vacuum envelope in 
many PPM-focused TWTs. The concentration of H2 in atmospheric air is too low 
to be of concern. However, hydrogen released from the corrosion of iron by water 
can be of concern. As a result, surface treatments of iron parts, such as 
electroplating, which prevent corrosion, will minimize the generation and 
permeation of hydrogen.

B.3.3   Diffusion 
 
In general, diffusion is the movement of one material through another. In high and 
ultrahigh vacuum chambers, we are concerned mostly about the diffusion of gases 
through the metallic walls of the chamber to the interior surface of the walls of the 
chamber. There, the gas is desorbed and contributes to the gas that must be 
removed from the system. The rate at which gas diffuses through metals is an 
exponential function of temperature so the use of heat (baking) to accelerate the 
diffusion process is often used. 
 
B.3.4   Desorption 
 
Gas molecules adhere to surfaces within a vacuum chamber and are said to be 
adsorbed on the surfaces. The source of this gas can be the atmosphere within the 
chamber or diffusion or permeation from the walls of the chamber. Gas-free 
surfaces in vacuum can become covered with gas molecules very quickly. For 
example, Figure B-1 shows that, at a pressure of 10â6 torr, the time required to 
form a monolayer of gas on a gas free surface is only one second. When adsorbed 
gas molecules are released from a surface they are said to be desorbed. The rate of 
desorption is an exponential function of temperature so baking is very effective in 
removing desorbed gas. 
 
Many adsorbed gasses are too tightly bonded to surfaces to be set free by 
baking. These can be desorbed by electron impact. As a result, many microwave 
tubes are operated with a pump attached for several hundred hours with the 
electron beam being used to assist in the outgassing process.  
 
B.3.5   Vaporization 
 
Great care is taken in selecting lowâvapor pressure materials for use in the 
construction of microwave tubes because the operation of the tubes is very 
sensitive to the presence of gas. As examples of metals to be avoided, consider 
brass, which contains zinc, or screws plated with cadmium. First of all, the vapor 
pressure of these metals at 500Â°C (the temperature at which tubes are usually 
baked) is ~1 torr so the interior of the tube would be coated with a zinc or 
cadmium film. Secondly, in those parts of the tube operating at a temperature of 
~200Â°C or more (the collector and the gun), the zinc or cadmium gas pressure 
would be ~10â4â10â5 torr, which would make it impossible to operate the tube. 
 
 B.3.6   Virtual Leaks 
 
Virtual leaks occur when gases, which are chemically or mechanically trapped 
inside the vacuum envelope, are released. Some examples of sources of virtual 
leaks are: 

Appendix B  Vacuum Technology 
 
765 
 
1. A weld joint that is made on the outside (atmospheric side) of the vacuum 
envelope. Dirt or other contaminants, which are trapped between the 
welded parts on the inside (vacuum side) of the joint, release gas that 
slowly leaks into the vacuum chamber. 
 
2. A screw that is used to fasten a part in an electron gun. The threads of the 
screw have not been properly vented and so gas that is trapped and not 
completely driven out during bakeout is slowly released. 
 
3. An inadequately outgassed part inside the vacuum envelope. Gas from 
the part slowly diffuses into the vacuum chamber. 
 
4. During thermal cycling, a microscopic crack that develops on the inner 
(vacuum side) of a ceramic insulator. This crack exposes a tiny gas-filled 
void and the gas slowly leaks into the vacuum chamber. 
 
 
Virtual leaks are avoided by following good design practice, eliminating gas 
traps, and properly processing parts. There is no external test that can detect a 
virtual leak. The use of a getter or an appendage pump is an inexpensive and 
straightforward way to prevent gas problems in the event that a virtual leak occurs. 
 
B.3.7   Real Leaks 
 
A real leak results from a pore in the wall of the vacuum envelope. Examples of 
pores are voids caused by impurities or inclusions in the wall material or cracks 
caused by thermal or mechanical stress. 
 
The leak rate for air as a function of pore size (radius and length) is shown in 
Figure B-5. The slope of 1/3 indicates molecular flow. A hole size on the order of 
at least 3 molecular diameters (~10A or 10â7 cm) is required for pore leakage. 
Smaller holes are likely to be plugged by large molecules.  Thus, pore leakage is 
unlikely to occur below a leak rate of about 10â15 torr-liters/sec for a 1-mm-long 
pore. (1 torr-liter/sec â 1 cm3/sec at standard temperature and pressure). At this 
leak rate, the pressure in a dormant TWT with an internal volume of 0.025 liter 
and without a getter or pump would increase to about 10â6 torr in one year. At this 
pressure, there is high likelihood that proper tube operation would not be possible. 
Thus, even the smallest pore leak is unacceptable for most applications. 
 
 
B.4   VACUUM SYSTEMS 
 
There is no single vacuum pump that is capable of evacuating a chamber from 
atmospheric pressure down to the ultrahigh vacuum range. Instead, as is shown in 
Figure B-6, at least two pumps are required. One, the roughing pump or fore 
pump, evacuates the system from atmospheric pressure down to the 10â2â10â4 torr 
range. The other, the high- vacuum pump, reduces the pressure to the high to 
ultrahigh vacuum range.

The operation of the system is straightforward. If the entire system is at 
atmospheric pressure, then, with both valves open, the roughing pump is started. 
When the pressure in the system has decreased to the pressure at which the high-
vacuum pump can start operating (usually ~10â2â10â4 torr) then the high-vacuum 
pump is started and the roughing pressure valve is closed. If all goes well (there 
are no leaks for example) then the high-vacuum pump will reduce the pressure to 
the high to ultrahigh vacuum range. 

Appendix B  Vacuum Technology 
 
767 
 
Very often, the entire system is not started at atmospheric pressure. Instead, 
initially, the high-vacuum valve is closed and the high-vacuum pump is operating 
(it was evacuated and started during a previous pump-down cycle). Then, the 
roughing pump is started, the tube to be evacuated is pumped to the 10â2â10â4 torr 
range,  the roughing valve is closed, and the high-vacuum valve is opened. 
 
From the discussion in this section, it is clear that vacuum pumps may be 
divided into two major categories: roughing pumps and high-vacuum pumps. The 
pumps most commonly used in the fabrication and operation of microwave tubes 
are described in Sections B.5 and B.6. 
 
 
B.5   ROUGHING PUMPS 
 
There are four roughing pumps that are frequently used in microwave tube 
manufacturing: 
 
â¢ 
Oil filled mechanical pump; 
â¢ 
Scroll pump; 
â¢ 
Sorption pump; 
â¢ 
Venturi pump. 
 
B.5.1   Oil-Filled Mechanical Pumps 
 
An example of the oil-filled mechanical pump is the sliding vane rotary pump, the 
essential elements of which are illustrated in Figure B-7. A rotating cylinder 
containing spring-loaded vanes transfers gas from the inlet port to the output port. 
A high-grade vacuum oil is used in the assembly containing the rotating cylinder 
and vanes. The oil serves as a lubricant and also provides a vacuum seal between 
moving parts.

A problem with mechanical pumps is the pumping of condensable vapors 
such as water. If these vapors condense during the compression cycle, they may 
emulsify with the pump oil and degrade the lubricating properties. Also, the 
ultimate pressure capability of the pump is reduced because the vapors are 
released from the pump oil in the inlet side of the pump. This problem may be 
avoided with the use of a gas ballast device that operates during the compression 
cycle. Pumping speed curves for sliding vane rotary pumps are shown in Figure 
B-8. The ultimate pressure is ~10â2â10â4 torr.

B.5.2   Scroll Pumps 
 
Scroll pumps are oil-free and require no lubricant or sealant. The scroll pump uses 
two plates, each of which has a spiral-shaped pattern impressed in it. One of these 
plates is stationary and fits inside the other, which moves with an orbital motion. 
As the movable scroll orbits, moving crescent-shaped gas pockets are formed that 
compress the gas that they contain. This action is indicated in Figure B-9. First a 
large pocket of gas is trapped (in a), then as the movable plate orbits, (b through 
h), the pocket becomes smaller and smaller. Finally, (in i and j), the gases are 
expelled at the center of the fixed plate. A pumping speed curve for a Varian 
triscroll pump is shown in Figure B-10. 
 
B.5.3   Sorption Pumps 
 
A sorption pump is capable of evacuating a chamber from atmospheric pressure to 
the medium vacuum range. A typical pump is shown in Figure B-11. The 
operating principle is the physical adsorption of gases on the surfaces of molecular 
sieves. Zeolite, an alkali alumino-silicate, is frequently used.

The surface area of the pores is about 10 3 m 2 per gram. The pore diameter of 
zeolite 13X (about 13Ã) is approximately the size of water vapor, oil vapor, and 
large gas molecules. Large molecules are, therefore, readily adsorbed. Small 
molecules such as hydrogen, helium, and neon are very poorly adsorbed. 
 
The adsorption of gases is dependent on pressure and temperature as shown in 
Figure B-12. Note that the difference between the quantity of nitrogen adsorbed 
and the quantity of neon or helium adsorbed is at least four orders of magnitude. 
 
In practice, hydrogen and helium are normally present in the gases to be 
evacuated from a microwave tube. This is because a hydrogen atmosphere is used 
during brazing processes and an inert gas atmosphere containing helium is 
frequently used for inert gas welding. Since hydrogen and helium are normally 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons

present, it is necessary to be cautious in using a sorption pump. Because the pump 
operates mostly in the viscous flow range, hydrogen and helium are dragged along 
with the gases readily pumped by the zeolite. As long as the pumping process 
takes place fairly quickly, hydrogen and helium can be pulled into the sorption 
pump, and then a valve can be closed before the hydrogen and helium diffuse back 
into the chamber being pumped.

Sorption pumps are immersed in liquid nitrogen to achieve large pumping 
capacities. To rejuvenate zeolite after pumping, the pump is warmed to room 
temperature. Gas is released from the zeolite and escapes from the pump through 
an exhaust port. If a great deal of water vapor or other condensables has been 
pumped, it may be necessary to bake the zeolite for a few hours at 200Â°C or more. 
 
B.5.4   Venturi Pumps 
 
The operation of the sorption pump can be improved by using a venturi pump 
(Figure B-13) to remove 50â80% of the gas in the system before the sorption 
pump is used.

B.6   HIGH-VACUUM PUMPS 
 
There are five commonly used high-vacuum pumps in the microwave tube 
industry: 
 
â¢ 
Diffusion pump; 
â¢ 
Ion pump; 
â¢ 
Turbomolecular pump; 
â¢ 
Cryogenic pump; 
â¢ 
Nonevaporable getter. 
 
B.6.1   Diffusion Pumps 
 
A diffusion pump (Figure B-14) is normally used in conjunction with a rotary 
pump to achieve pressures in the high or ultrahigh vacuum range. A very high 
quality silicon oil is vaporized by a heating element in the bottom of the pump. 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
772 
The oil vapors are formed into jets. Collisions of oil molecules with gas molecules 
cause the gas to diffuse toward the exhaust port. A pressure difference (between 
inlet and exhaust) of approximately six orders of magnitude can be produced with 
a diffusion pump. The pump is normally water cooled and so the oil is condensed 
and returns to the oil bath in the bottom of the pump.

Typical pumping speed and throughput for a diffusion pump are shown in 
Figure B-15. Note that speed is constant over a wide range of pressures. 
  
At very low pressures, the ultimate vacuum level is limited primarily by 
diffusion of oil molecules back into the chamber being pumped. This is referred to 
as backstreaming and was discussed previously in this appendix. A baffle is 
sometimes used between the pump and the chamber to limit backstreaming. 
Metallic elements are arranged as indicated in Figure B-16 so that there is no 
line-of-sight path through the baffle. Baffles are normally cooled, sometimes by 
liquid nitrogen, to enhance the condensation of oil vapors. With a baffle it is 
sometimes possible to reduce the ultimate pressure by over two orders of 
magnitude.

B.6.2   Ion Pumps 
 
The configuration of an ion pump is shown in Figure B-17. Ion pumps are capable 
of evacuating a chamber to the ultrahigh vacuum range. They require a pressure in 
the low end of the medium vacuum range (~10â2 torr) before they can be started. 
Often, an sorption pump is used to generate this medium vacuum level. Once an 
ion pump has been started, it can operate without assistance from other pumps. 
 
The operation of an ion pump is indicated in Figure B-18. A cellular anode 
structure is located between two planar cathodes. A magnetic field is applied 
perpendicular to the cathode planes and parallel to the cell axes. Electrons spiral 
around the magnetic field lines and ionize gas molecules. Electrons released 
during ionization participate in further ionization of other gas molecules. During 
collisions, electrons give up energy and gradually migrate to the anode. The 
positive ions are accelerated to the negative electrode, which is fabricated from 
titanium. The ions interact with the titanium, and at least three pumping actions 
occur as indicated in Figure B-19.

1. Ions sputter titanium cathode material, which deposits and acts as a getter 
film, adsorbing reactive gases (such as nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen). 
 
2. The energy of some ions is sufficient for them to be buried in the 
electrode surfaces, where they are adsorbed by ion implantation. This 
process is effective for all types of ions including those of rare or inert 
gases. 
 
3. Enhanced pumping of noble gases is possible with a triode ion pump 
(Figure B-20) because sputtered titanium from the cathodes buries gas 
atoms on the target electrode.

The voltage of operation is typically about 3.5 kV for small pumps and about 
7 kV for large pumps. Ion pumps as small as 0.2 l/s and as large as several 
thousand liters per second are available. A small pump is often used as an 
appendage pump, which is an integral part of a microwave tube. An example of a 
coupled-cavity TWT with an appendage ion pump is shown in Figure B-21. As 
shown in Figure B-22, pump current is directly proportional to pressure and, after 
calibration, may be used as a measure of pressure.

The magnetic flux density varies somewhat with the size of the pump and is 
0.125 tesla (1,250 gauss) for an 8 l/s ion pump. The stray magnetic field of the 
pump is of concern in electron beam applications and so care must be taken in 
locating the pump.

B.6.3   Turbomolecular Pumps 
 
A turbomolecular pump is like a jet engine. A rotor, spinning at a high speed, 
compresses gas by imparting momentum to impinging molecules. As indicated in 
Figure B-23, many rotor discs are used. The gas channels for the discs are in 
series, so that, even though the pressure gradient generated by each disc is small, 
the pump is capable of maintaining a high pressure ratio. The pumps operate at 
rotor speeds up to ~80,000 rpm. They have large compression ratios for hydrogen 
and ultimate pressures in the 10â10 torr range. The fore pressure is ~10â2 torr so oil- 
free backing pumps such as the scroll pump can be used.

B.6.4   Cryogenic Pumps 
 
Cryogenic pumps operate on the principle that gases can be condensed at low 
temperatures and have extremely low vapor pressures. An example of a cryogenic 
pump is shown in Figure B-24. This pump operates in the 10â3â10â10 torr range.

In operation, the 80K array traps water and hydro-carbon vapors. The 15K array 
condenses nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. The specially processed charcoal in this 
array traps helium, hydrogen, and neon. 
 
Cryogenic pumps require periodic regeneration to return them to normal 
operation capabilities. Regeneration removes trapped gases in a process similar to 
defrosting a refrigerator. The frequency with which a pump must be regenerated 
depends, of course, on the pump capacity and the gas load (operating pressure). In 
some cases it is suggested that a pump should be regenerated on a regular schedule 
that coincides with the system maintenance, weekend system shutdown, and so 
forth. Typically, the frequency of regeneration ranges from a few hundred hours 
for high gas load operations to many thousand hours at low pressures (below 10â5 
torr).

B.6.5   Nonevaporable Getters 
 
The phenomenon of gettering has long been used in vacuum tubes. In conventional 
getters, a chemically active metal is evaporated to form a film on the inner surface 
of the vacuum envelope. Gases that react with the metal film are said to be 
gettered. Conventional getters have not found application in high-power 
microwave tubes primarily because the evaporated film may cause electrical 
leakage or breakdown in high- voltage structures. 
 
Nonevaporable getters are now commonly used in microwave tubes. The 
ST175 getters available from SAES GETTERS/USA Inc., are particularly 
attractive for use. These getters utilize a mixture of titanium and molybdenum 
powders in a weight ratio of 9:1. The material is lightly pressed and sintered to 
form a structure that is porous and has good mechanical stability. It is possible to 
use these getters in holders made of nichrome as is indicated in Figure B-25.

The ST175 can be satisfactorily activated by heating to 500Â°C for 10 minutes 
in vacuum (< 10â3 torr) so these getters can be conveniently used during the 
bakeout of tubes. As an example, the results of sorption tests for CO and H2 
activated in this manner are shown in Figure B-26. 
  
Some of the microwave tube experience with nonevaporable getters installed 
in an electron gun is as follows: 
 
 
1. Appendage ion pump current, which might sometimes be high, is 
virtually zero. 
 
2. Arcing in the electron gun is greatly reduced. 
 
3. After extended periods of storage, voltage can be applied immediately to 
a tube without gassing or arcing. 
 
4. The getters are recoverable. After activation and then exposure to air, 
getters can be reactivated.

B.7   VACUUM GAUGES 
 
The gauges most commonly used in the microwave tube industry for measuring 
pressures in the rough to ultrahigh vacuum ranges are: 
 
â¢ 
Thermocouple gauge 
â 
Rough and medium vacuum 
â¢ 
Ionization gauge  
â 
High and ultrahigh vacuum 
â¢ 
Ion pump current  
â 
High and ultrahigh vacuum 
 
 
The use of ion-pump current as a measure of pressure was discussed in 
Section B.6.2. Thermocouple and ionization gauges will be described in this 
section. 
 
B.7.1   Thermocouple Gauge 
 
The thermocouple gauge is one of several gauges that use the thermal conductivity 
of gas to provide the pressure indication. As indicated in Figure B-27, a filament 
of wire heated by an electric current is mounted in an envelope attached to the 
vacuum system. The temperature of the wire depends on heat loss through the gas, 
which depends on gas pressure. The wire temperature is monitored with a 
thermocouple, which is calibrated to indicate pressure. Thermocouple gauges 
operate over the pressure range of ~ 10 to 10â3 torr.

B.7.2   Ionization Gauge 
 
Ionization gauges of the type shown in Figure B-28 are commonly used to 
measure pressures in the high and ultrahigh vacuum ranges. Electrons, accelerated 
by a positive grid, produce ions that are collected by an ion collector. The resulting 
ion current is a measure of gas pressure. These gauges are sometimes referred to as 
inverted triode ion gauges, or Bayard-Alpert gauges. In these gauges, a very small 
diameter wire is used as the ion collector. This is to minimize the X-rays produced 
when electrons strike the positive grid. Some of these X-rays impinge on the 
collector wire, causing it to release electrons. The resulting flow of electron 
current away from the collector causes an error in pressure indication. 
 
 
B.8   BAKEOUT 
 
Bakeout is the process of heating a tube to facilitate evacuation. As pointed out 
previously in this appendix, the rates of diffusion and the desorption of gases vary 
exponentially with temperature, so heat is used to aid in the evacuation process. 
The bakeout temperature commonly used in the microwave tube industry is ~500â
525Â°C. Typically, bakeout takes place in a system like that shown in Figure B-29. 
The tube to be evacuated is connected to a vacuum pump and heated until the 
desired vacuum level is obtained.

Since the tube is very hot (at 500Â°C the entire tube glows a dull red color) it is 
necessary to protect the outside from oxidation. Not only does oxidation look bad, 
but it could damage vacuum joints, change critical mechanical dimensions, and 
cause flaking of material. Oxidation is prevented by providing a partial vacuum 
around the outside of the tube during the bakeout process with a mechanical 
roughing pump. 
 
 
B.9   MICROWAVE TUBE MATERIALS 
 
For proper performance, microwave tubes must operate in the high to ultrahigh 
vacuum range. At best, an ion pump or getter may be used as an integral part of a 
tube to help maintain the vacuum level. At worst, no pump is used, and the tube 
may be required to operate properly after several years in storage. The most 
important factor in achieving and maintaining an acceptable vacuum level is the 
use of the correct materials for fabricating a tube. Many of the materials 
commonly used are listed in Figure B-30.

Figure B-30   Some materials used inside the vacuum envelope of microwave tubes. 
 
 
The primary factor considered in selecting a metal for use inside the vacuum 
envelope is vapor pressure. The charts in Figure B-31, B-32, and B-33 give vapor 
pressure as a function of temperature for the metallic elements. 
 
As an example of the use of these charts, consider zinc (see Figure B-31). At 
low temperatures, the vapor pressure is reasonable (10â9 torr at 100Â°C). At a 
somewhat elevated temperature (400Â°C), the vapor pressure is only 10â1 torr. This 

Klystrons, TWTs, Magnetrons, Crossed-Field Amplifiers, and Gyrotrons 
 
784 
shows why brass (which contains zinc) must not be used in a vacuum system that 
may be heated. If brass was used and baked at 400Â°C or higher, zinc vapor would 
permeate the entire system. 
 
The curve for barium in Figure B-33 is significant in considering the 
operation of cathodes. At a cathode operating temperature of 1,000Â°C, the vapor 
pressure of barium is over 1 torr. Thus, excess barium (over ~ monolayer) on the 
cathode surface evaporates very rapidly. This evaporated barium may eventually 
deposit on insulating surfaces and cause electrical leakage or breakdown. To 
remove excess barium, a new cathode is often placed in vacuum and operated at a 
high temperature before it is placed in a tube.

Nonmetallic materials, such as those shown in Figure B-34, are sometimes 
used in demountable vacuum systems. These materials severely limit the pressure 
and temperature at which the system can operate. 
 
When a nonmetallic material is required in a system that must be baked, one 
of a very small number of materials is selected. If the material is part of the 
vacuum envelope, then either Al2O3 (aluminum oxide), BeO (beryllium oxide), 
glass or, in special cases, CVD diamond is selected. These materials have 
extremely low vapor pressures. Inside the vacuum envelope, in addition to Al2O3 
or BeO, boron nitride or diamond is used.

Some liquids may have extremely low vapor pressures. Examples are 
diffusion pump oils. Still, there is no liquid suitable for use in the high or ultrahigh 
vacuum environment of a microwave tube. It is also appropriate to point out that 
no lubricants are suitable for use in a microwave tube. Thus, in the spin tuned 
magnetron, where a portion of the anode rotates at 4,000 rpm, no lubricants are 
used. Instead, metals are carefully selected, treated and precisely machined so that 
galling and excessive wear do not occur. 
 
 
B.10   JOINING TECHNIQUES 
 
The references for this appendix contain detailed information concerning many of 
the joining techniques and processes used in the microwave tube industry. It is 
possible here to describe briefly only a few of the important aspects of microwave 
tube fabrication. 
 
First of all, as was pointed out in the previous section, it is essential that 
materials to be used are properly selected and cleaned. Then, metals may be joined 
by brazing or welding. Ceramics may be joined to metals by brazing. In no case is 
it possible to use solid fluxes because they may become trapped in joints and then 
produce virtual leaks, that is, they very slowly leak out of joints and produce 
contamination. 
 

Appendix B  Vacuum Technology 
 
787 
B.10.1   Brazing 
 
From OâHanlon [3], âThe joining process of two metal parts with a third one 
having a lower melting point is known generally as soldering. When the solder has 
a melting point lower than 400Â°C, the process is known as soft soldering; if the 
solder melts above 500Â°C, the process is known as hard soldering.  
 
Brazing is defined as the metal joining process in which melted filler metal is 
drawn by capillary attraction into the space between the closely adjacent surfaces 
of the parts to be joined (British Standard 499/1952 [12]). The temperatures 
required for brazing are above 500Â°C (American Welding Society [13]). 
 
It must be remembered that, during the evacuation of a microwave tube, 
bakeout temperatures in excess on 500Â°C are normally used. Thus, to avoid the 
possibility of melting, softening, or excessive vaporization, filler materials must be 
used that melt at temperatures well above 500Â°C. It is common, for example, to 
use filler materials that melt at about 900Â°C. The Brazing Handbook [14] contains 
descriptions of brazing filler materials and their uses.  
 
The temperatures required for brazing are very high and it is important to 
properly control the variation of temperature with time. The reasons for this can be 
seen by referring to Figure B-35. During stage 1, the parts are preheated as fast as 
possible consistent with avoiding warping and thermal shock. Thermal equilibrium 
is established during stage 2. It is important for all parts to reach the solidus 
temperature at the same time. Stage 3 is the brazing step. The final temperature is 
adjusted to obtain the desired viscosity of the filler. The time spent in the liquidus 
region is minimized. Finally, the parts are cooled as quickly as possible. The most 
critical portion of cooldown is dropping the temperature below the solidus 
temperature.

Some of the problems that occur if temperature is not properly controlled 
during brazing are shown in Figure B-36. The ideal braze joint is the one with the 
full fillet. If either temperature or time are inadequate, then the filler material may 
not be completely melted and so the underbrazed condition results. If the parts are 
not properly cleaned or the joint tolerance is incorrect, then voids may occur 
which can result in leaks or virtual leaks. If the temperature is too high or the time 
that the parts are held at a high temperature is too long, then the filler may alloy 
with the parts being brazed and cause erosion.

Manufacture lectures, Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center.) 
 
 
Because of the critical nature of the brazing operation, there are only a few 
processes that can be used. The most common are oven brazing and induction 
brazing. Fluxes cannot be used so brazes must be performed in vacuum or in a 
reducing atmosphere of hydrogen. Hydrogen is often used rather than a vacuum 
because brazing can be performed more rapidly. In some cases, such as brazing of 
stainless steel, extremely dry hydrogen must be used to prevent oxidation. An 
induction heating system for brazing in hydrogen is shown in Figure B-37. 
 
Ceramic-to-metal seals are made by first metallizing the ceramic and then 
brazing the metallic part to the metallized surface. One of the most important 
factors to be considered is the thermal expansion of the parts. Figure B-38 shows 
how thermal expansion coefficients vary with temperature. When ceramics and 
metals having thermal expansion coefficients that differ significantly are used, 
great care must be taken in the design of the seal. In some cases the metal element 

Appendix B  Vacuum Technology 
 
789 
is designed to be flexible in the region of the braze. In a butt ceramic-to-metal seal, 
as shown in Figure B-39, the metal is sandwiched between ceramic pieces that are 
massive enough to force the metal to expand and contract with the ceramic.

B.10.2   Welding 
 
Several types of welding are used in the manufacture of microwave tubes: 
 
â¢ 
Tungsten inert gas (TIG); 
â¢ 
Resistance; 
â¢ 
Electron beam; 
â¢ 
Laser. 
 
 
TIG welding can be used manually or in automated systems A drawing of a 
manual inert gas welding torch is given in Figure B-40. With TIG welding, the 
heat produced by an arc melts the metal of the joint between workpieces and joins 
them together. Important parameters in the welding process are the current, which 
controls the depth and speed of the weld and current types (dc positive or negative 
or ac). Either argon or helium or a mixture of the two is the gas that is used. The 
gas must be very pure with impurities of 50 ppm at a maximum. 
 
Care must be taken in designing weld joints if adequate strength is to be 
obtained and gas and dirt traps are to be avoided. Examples of the precautions that 
must be taken in the formation of a welded joint between a tube and a flange are 
shown in Figure B-41. Whenever possible, the weld should be made on the 
vacuum side of the joint. Then, weld slag or other contaminants that may be 
trapped between the mating surfaces of the cylinder and flange will be outside of 
the vacuum seal. 
 
Resistance welding (sometimes called spot welding) is, perhaps, the simplest 
method for joining two metals. Using a device like that depicted in Figure B-42, 
high pressure is applied to the metal parts to be welded and then a current pulse is 
passed through the parts causing them to melt and fuse together.

Electron beam welding is generally performed in vacuum but can be done in 
an atmosphere. A beam accelerated to 0.3 â 0.7 times the speed of light is used to 
form deep narrow welds. The region affected by the weld is small so welding close 
to parts affected by heat is possible. Disadvantages are that a vacuum requirement 
is usually required, equipment costs are high, and close-fitting joints are required 
because of the narrow beam width that is used. 
 
Laser welding is accomplished with either a pulsed or a CW light beam. It is 
often used for welds of small parts in hard-to-reach locations such as the connection 
in a TWT of the last turn of a helix to the center conductor of a coaxial connector. 
It is also used when complex weld patterns are required. Compared with electron 
beam welding, smaller spot sizes are possible and the region affected by heat is 
smaller. One disadvantage of laser welding is that a large fraction of the light 
beam is reflected until the metals being welded have melted. Other disadvantages 
are that it is difficult to define the beamwidth and precise alignments and control 
of gaps are required. 
 
After assembly and processing of a metal-to-ceramic vacuum tube has been 
completed, it is necessary to separate the tube from the pumping station. (An 
appendage pump may remain as an integral part of the tube.) The technique 
universally used to separate the tube from the pumping station is illustrated in 
Figure B-43. Soft copper tubulation is used to make the vacuum connection to the 
pumping station. This tubulation is molecularly clean on the internal surfaces 
because it has been baked along with the microwave tube (at 450Â°C or higher). 
 

Appendix B  Vacuum Technology 
 
793 
 
By squeezing the tubulation with a special tool, the internal mating surfaces of 
the copper can be forced to flow together to form a cold weld. In its crudest form, 
the tool is similar to a manually operated bolt cutter with the cutting edges 
replaced by cylindrical steel bars. 
 
Because the manual squeeze-off (pinch-off) operation with the tool that is 
much like a bolt cutter is highly operator dependent, an automated system is 
normally employed.

Magnetics 
 
 
Magnetic fields are used for focusing electron beams in nearly all microwave 
tubes. These fields may be generated by permanent magnets or electromagnets. In 
a permanent magnet, electron motion within the material produces the magnetic 
field. In an electromagnet, current passing through a wire produces a magnetic 
field surrounding the wire. Ferromagnetic materials, permanent magnets, and 
electromagnets are discussed in this appendix [1â5]. 
 
 
C.1   MAGNETIC QUANTITIES 
 
In considerations of magnetics and magnetic materials, three quantities are of 
primary interest: 
 
 
â¢ 
Magnetic field intensity, H, is one of the elementary fields in nature. 
 
â¢ 
Magnetic flux density, B, is the density of magnetic flux lines produced 
by the magnetic field. 
 
â¢ 
Magnetic permeability, Î¼, is the property of a medium that determines 
how much flux is produced by a certain field level. Flux density is related 
to field intensity by 
 
B =  H
Î¼
 
(C-1) 
 
The units commonly used for H, B, and Î¼ are given in the following table

C.2   MAGNETIC CIRCUITS 
 
It is convenient, when thinking about magnetic circuits, to relate magnetic 
quantities to analogous quantities in electrical circuits. Figure C-1 indicates how 
magnetic and electric circuits are related. MMF is the magnetomotive force and is 
analogous to voltage. The source of the magnetomotive force can be either a 
permanent magnet or an electromagnet. Î¦ is the magnetic flux and is analogous to 
the current and reluctance is analogous to resistance.

Much can be learned by examining the magnetic circuit in Figure C-1. 
Consider Figure C-2 and assume that there is no flux leakage outside the magnetic 
circuit and also assume that the flux density in the gap, G, is uniform. The problem 
is to find expressions for the flux density, Bg, in the gap and for the operating 
conditions of the magnet. 
 
Let Hm be the magnetic field strength of the magnet, let HFe be the magnetic 
field in iron pole pieces that connect the magnet to the gap, and let Hg be the 
magnetic field in the gap. In terms of field quantities, the magnetic circuit equation

C.3   MAGNETIC MATERIALS 
 
Magnetic materials can be divided into three categories. These are: 
 
 
â¢ 
Î¼r < 1 
diamagnetic 
 
â¢ 
Î¼r > 1 
paramagnetic 
 
â¢ 
Î¼r >> 1 
ferromagnetic 
 
 
Diamagnetism is present in all materials. The establishment of magnetic flux 
is opposed by the material so that the relative permeability is less than unity. This 
effect is explained by the laws of Faraday and Lenz. When a magnetic field is 
applied, an electric field is produced. This electric field acts on the electron orbits 
in a material to produce microscopic reaction currents. The reaction currents 
produce a magnetic field that opposes the applied field. Diamagnetism is an 
extremely small effect. In most materials, it is overridden by paramagnetism or 
ferromagnetism. 
 
Paramagnetic materials have a relative permeability slightly greater than 
unity. In these materials, the application of an external magnetic field aligns 
permanent magnetic dipoles of atoms, ions, or molecules with the applied field, 
thus enhancing the field. 
 
In ferromagnetic materials, a specialized condition exists that greatly aids the 
applied magnetic field. This condition involves the electronic structures of atoms 
and the distances between atoms. The most stable configuration of the electrons is 
when their spin magnetic moments are parallel. The result is that complete 
alignment of the spins occurs within regions called magnetic domains. The 
application of an external field both aligns domains and shifts domain boundaries 
to produce an enormous field. 
 
 
C.3.1   Ferromagnetic Materials 
 
Ferromagnetic materials are highly nonlinear. The relation between B and H must 
be determined experimentally. This is done with a circuit like that in Figure C-4. 
 
From Ampereâs law, the magnetic field, H, in a magnetic sample is 
proportional to the current, I. From Faradayâs law, the voltage, V, induced in a 
winding is proportional to the time rate of change of magnetic flux linking the 
winding. The integral of voltage is, therefore, proportional to the flux and the 
magnetic flux density, B. 
 
A signal proportional to B is applied to the vertical input of an oscilloscope. A 
signal proportional to H is applied to the horizontal input. The result displayed on 
the oscilloscope is known as a hysteresis curve and is illustrated in Figure C-5.

When current is increased, the right-hand portion of the hysteresis curve is 
followed. When current is decreased, the left-hand portion is followed. At very 
large current excursions, the shape of the hysteresis curve is relatively independent 
of the current, and a loop known as the saturation loop is traversed. 
 
Several important characteristics of magnetic materials can be illustrated with 
the hysteresis loop. Some of these are shown in Figure C-5. When a magnetic field 
is first applied to a demagnetized sample, the initial magnetization curve is 

Appendix C  Magnetics

followed. When H is zero, there is a residual flux density, Br, in the material called 
the retentivity. The flux density, B, is reduced to zero when a field, Hc, called the 
coercive force or coercivity, is applied. 
 
If the alternating magnetizing current is gradually increased from zero, small 
hysteresis loops are followed which gradually increase in size as shown in Figure 
C-6(a). The tips of these loops form the normal magnetization curve. This is very 
similar in shape to the initial magnetization curve. This curve is a reproducible 
characteristic for a magnetic material. Figure C-6(b) shows that a material can be 
demagnetized by gradually reducing the alternating magnetic field to zero.

The relative permeability quoted for a material is based on the slope of the 
normal magnetization curve as shown in Figure C-7. The maximum value is 
normally used. It is significant to note that, at very low values of the magnetic 
field, the permeability is low. In fact, for most magnetic materials, the 
permeability at low values of H is so low that they will not shield against stray 
magnetic fields. This is sometimes of importance in the electron gun of a tube 
when it is necessary to shield the cathode from stray magnetic flux. At high values 
of H, the permeability is also low. In fact, when a material is driven well into 
saturation, the permeability approaches the permeability of free space. This must 
be kept in mind in the design of magnetic pole pieces to be used in regions of high 
magnetic field. The concentration of flux lines at corners of pole pieces, for 
example, can cause saturation and distortion of the field pattern.

C.3.2   Normal and Intrinsic Hysteresis Curves 
 
The current used for applying a magnetizing force to the sample in the test 
described in Figure C-4 does two things: 
 
 
1. Orients the domains and magnetizes the sample; 
 
2. Generates a field that would be there in the absence of the sample. 
 
As a result, to find the true (intrinsic) hysteresis characteristic of the sample, the 
additional field that must be supplied must be subtracted. The result is that two 
hysteresis loops shown in Figure C-8 must be considered. These are: 
 
1. The normal induction loop that contains the additional field; 
2. The intrinsic induction loop which is a characteristic of only the metal. 
 
The flux density for the normal loop is

where Bi is the magnetic flux density for intrinsic induction (which results from 
the magnetization of the material). Figure C-9 is useful in explaining the 
difference between normal and intrinsic induction. 
 
In Figure C-9(a), the situation is the same as in Figure C-4. That is, the current 
produces a magnetizing force that magnetizes the sample (produces intrinsic flux 
density Bi) and produces the free-space flux density, Î¼oH. In Figure C-9(b), the 
magnetizing force (current carrying coil) has been removed so H is 0 and the 
sample has been left in a magnetized state with a flux density, Br, which is the 
residual flux density (retentivity).

Figure C-9   (aâc) Normal and intrinsic inductance effects in magnetic material with a gap. 
 
 
In Figure C-9(c), there is a gap in the magnetic sample. When the gap is cut, 
north and south magnetic poles are formed in the faces of the magnet. Within the 
gap, the magnetic field, H, is from north to south and is in the same direction as 
the flux density, B. The flux density produced by H in the gap is Î¼oH. In the 
magnet, the field, H, is also from north to south but is in the direction opposite to B.

804 
The flux density produced by H in the magnet is âÎ¼oH Thus, H tends to 
demagnetize the magnet. This effect is the same as reversing the current through 
the coil in Figure C-9(a). This reverses the field generated by the coil and moves 
the operating point on the BâH curve to the left of the B axis as shown in Figure 
C-10. This is the second quadrant of the hysteresis loop. The curve in this region is 
called the demagnetization curve. Here, the field is opposite to B so 
demagnetization occurs. From Figure C-9, it is seen that the flux density in the gap 
is Bi + Î¼oH so it is the normal BâH curve that is used for magnet design and for 
determining demagnetization.

Figure C-10   Demagnetizing curve in second quadrant of the hysteresis loop. 
 
 
In Figure C-9 when the magnetizing coil was removed, the sample was left in 
a magnetized state with a flux density of Br. Thus, a permanent magnet was 
formed, but all of the flux was contained within the magnetic material, so there is 
no way that the flux could be used, for example, to exert a force on electrons. 
When a gap was cut in the sample, flux was made available for use. 
 
Now, two considerations concerning the design of permanent magnet circuits 
are immediately evident from Figure C-10: 
 
 
1. For optimum utilization of the magnet, the gap must be long enough to 
provide a reasonable gap volume in which interactions with the flux 
density can take place. On the other hand, the gap must not be so long 
that the flux density becomes too low. 
 
2. A material with a coercivity, âHc, as large as possible as well as with a 
large retentivity, Br, should be used to maximize the gap length (and gap 
volume) for a given flux density.  

Appendix C  Magnetics 
 
805 
C.3.3   Energy Product 
 
Magnet materials for TWTs are selected primarily on the basis of the magnetic 
energy that they can produce in an air (or vacuum) gap. A second important 
consideration, which will be discussed later, is temperature stability. The energy 
per unit volume, w, in a magnetic field is 
 
 
 
w = â«H â¢ d B  
(C-15) 
Thus, ignoring fringe effects, the total energy, Wg, in the magnetic field in the gap 
of a magnet is w multiplied by the volume of the gap, or

but this is the energy in the field within the magnet. Thus, the energy delivered by 
the magnet is the energy established in the gap. This is analogous to saying that 
the power delivered by an electrical circuit is the power received by the load. The 
energy delivered by the magnet is proportional to the cross-hatched area in Figure 
C-10. This area is referred to as the energy product of the magnet. To maximize 
the energy product (and maximize the energy established in the gap), the gap 
length, lg, must be such that the shaded area is maximized. The variation of energy 
product with the position of the operating point is shown in Figure C-11.

C.3.4   Rare Earth Magnet Materials  
 
Rare earth magnets are the magnets of choice for most modern microwave tube 
applications. The most common material used is samarium cobalt. The advantage 
of samarium cobalt over some other materials that have been used in the past is 
shown by the demagnetization curves in Figure C-12. The energy product for 
samarium cobalt is approximately four times that of alnico V, which is a magnet 
material that was in common use in microwave tubes 30 years ago. The coercive 
force is over an order of magnitude greater than that of alnico V, with the result 
that the samarium cobalt magnets are extremely stable.

Permanent magnets on microwave tubes must be able to operate over a wide 
temperature range with no significant change in characteristics. Conventional 
samarium cobalt (SmCo5) has a field strength temperature coefficient of about 
0.04%/Â°C. Electron Energy Corporation developed a series of Sm2Co17 magnet 
grades that are temperature compensated so that they have a near-zero temperature 
coefficient. This was done by substituting gadolinium for a portion of the 
samarium the alloy [6].  
 
Figure C-13 shows the demagnetization curves at various temperatures for 
one of a series of Sm2Co17 high-temperature magnets. These magnets have an 
energy product of 20 MGOe. Notice that the normal demagnetization plots are 
extremely linear. This simplifies the analysis of magnetic circuits in which these 
magnets are used.

C.4   PERMANENT MAGNETS [5] 
 
C.4.1   Straight Field Magnets 
 
Historically, permanent magnets were sometimes used for electron beam focusing 
in TWTs and klystrons. These magnets were large and heavy and could produce 
only limited magnetic fields. Figure C-14 shows the magnet used on the SLAC 
2422 klystron [7]. The magnet was barrel shaped, produced a magnetic flux 
density of about 0.06T, and was designed for a gap length of 16.5 inches. The 
inside diameter was 8.5 inches which provided space for the insertion of lead 
shielding and for the easy removal of the tube from the magnet. The maximum 
outside diameter was approximately 18 inches and the total weight was nearly 800 
pounds. Permanent magnets were used because they made it possible to eliminate 
240 focusing coils, focusing supplies, and water interlocks.

Lebacqz, SLAC-PUB-87, 1965.) 
 
C.4.2   Periodic Permanent Magnets 
 
In the majority of applications of microwave tubes, it is necessary to minimize 
weight and size. For these applications, periodic permanent magnet (PPM) 
focusing is used. The weight reduction of the focusing system, when compared 
with a solenoid or a unidirectional magnet, can be one to two orders of magnitude. 
The reason for this weight reduction can be explained by first noting that a 
solenoid or unidirectional magnet establishes a magnetic field in a volume far 
larger than that required for focusing the electron beam. Since the weight of the 
magnet is roughly proportional to the magnetic energy stored in the volume 
surrounding the magnet, much of the weight of the magnet results from the 
production of unused magnetic field.  Figure C-15 [8] is useful in explaining why 
the PPM weight is so low. Assume first that the magnet in Figure C-15(a) has the 
most efficient design (magnet weight is minimized) to produce a magnetic field to 
focus an electron beam as it travels through the magnet. The most efficient design 
is the one that nearly optimizes the energy product for the magnet. 
 
Next, assume that it is desired to focus the same beam over a distance that is 
three times the length of the magnet in Figure C-15(a). This may be accomplished 
with the magnet in Figure C-15(b) but, to produce the same magnetic field that 
was produced by the magnet in Figure C-15(a), it is necessary to increase all 
dimensions of the magnet by a factor of three. (Remember that the dimensions of a 
permanent magnet are established to nearly maximize the energy product. A 
magnet configuration other than that shown in Figure C-15(b) would result in 
either a reduction in magnetic field or an increase in magnet weight.) As a result, 
the magnet in Figure C-15(b) weighs 33 or 27 times as much as the magnet in (a), 
and the energy stored in the field surrounding the magnet in Figure C-15(b) is 27 
times that for Figure C-15(a). By comparison, if three magnets like that in (a) were 

Appendix C  Magnetics 
 
809 
stacked with like poles together as shown in Figure C-15(c), then a field sufficient 
to focus the beam could be produced over the same length as for magnet Figure 
C-15(b). The total weight and energy stored for the magnets in Figure C-15(c) 
would be one-ninth of the weight and energy stored for the magnet in Figure 
C-15(b).

permanent magnets. (Adapted from: J. T. Mendel et al., Proc. IRE, May 1954. Â© 1954 IRE 
(now IEEE).) 
 
 
If the magnet in Figure C-15(b) was replaced by n smaller magnets aligned 
like those in Figure C-15(c), the weight of the resulting structure would be 1/n2 
times that of the larger magnet. In practice, the weight saving is not this great. This 
is because the field on the axis of the periodic structure does not appear as a square 
wave with abrupt reversals occurring at magnet interfaces. Instead, the field may 
be more nearly sinusoidal and the peak value must be increased to produce the 
same effective field as would be produced by the square wave. As a result, the 
magnet sizes must be increased to produce the required effective field. 
 
Since magnet weight is roughly proportional to 1/n2, and since it is usually 
desirable to minimize magnet and tube weight, it is reasonable to ask what limits 
the number of magnets that is used. Qualitatively, this question can be answered 
by referring to Figure C-16 in which an electron beam focused by a periodic 
permanent magnet structure is illustrated. First, the interior dimension of the 
magnets has to be large enough to surround the electron beam and (not shown in 
Figure C-16) the RF circuit. Second, each magnet and the gap between pole pieces 
must be long enough so that magnetic field lines of sufficient strength for focusing 
penetrate into the electron beam. Third, as shown in Chapter 7, the wrong choice 
of magnet length and period of the magnet structure can lead to excessive beam

ripple or beam divergence. Finally, other considerations to be discussed later in 
this appendix lead to the use of double-period focusing or, possibly, to long- 
period focusing. 
 
In PPM structures like that in Figure C-16, ring-shaped magnets are used to 
form magnetic lenses that periodically focus the electron beam traveling along the 
center of the structure. Periodic magnetic focusing of an electron beam is 
discussed in Chapter 7. 
 
A problem with the ring-shaped magnets illustrated in Figure C-16 is that 
each must be split in order to be placed on the tube. This is one of the factors 
leading to nonuniformities in the magnetic fields produced by these structures. To 
obtain acceptable tube performance, it is often necessary to compensate for the 
nonuniformities by placing magnetic shims on the outside of the magnetic 
assembly.

A technique for avoiding some of the problems of ring-shaped magnets is 
shown in Figure C-17. Several (often four) pill-shaped magnets are placed 
between magnetic pole pieces that surround the axis of the tube. The magnets can 
be magnetized to the desired level and then placed on the tube without being split. 
Field uniformity is increased (as compared with the ring-shaped magnets). In 
addition, magnet cost is reduced because magnets of one size can be used on tubes 
having a wide range of sizes. 
 
C.4.3   Double-Period and Long-Period Focusing 
 
Double-period focusing is used in coupled-cavity TWTs. In those tubes, as shown 
in Figure C-18, some cavity walls also serve as pole pieces that concentrate the 
magnetic flux in the electron beam. Other cavity walls serve as flux guides to 
shape the magnetic field in the beam.

focusing. 
 
 
Slots in the cavity walls are used to couple the RF field from cavity to cavity. 
Often, the slots in adjacent walls are on opposite sides of the axis. The slots 
produce asymmetries in the focusing field, which produce transverse forces that 
deflect the electron beam. By arranging the magnets as shown in Figure C-18, the 
transverse forces produced by adjacent pole pieces are in opposite directions and 
so the deflections of the beam are in opposite directions. This prevents the beam 
from gradually being forced off axis as it moves from pole piece to pole piece.

Next, consider the rationale for long-period focusing (LPF) [9]. A single 
permanent magnet can be used to produce a uniform field to focus a beam. If a 
reversal of the otherwise uniform field takes place in a very short distance, the 
electron beam wonât âknowâ that the field reverses. The rotation of the beam will 
reverse but, assuming no cathode flux, the focusing force will remain constant. 
With many reversals and very short distances between reversals, many smaller 
magnets could be used, each one of which had its polarity reversed from the 
previous magnet. The advantage in doing this would be the reduction in the weight 
of the magnets. PPM focusing is the limit, in terms of weight reduction but not 
necessarily in terms of practicality and cost. Long-period focusing is the 
compromise between minimum weight and minimum cost. 
 
A primary application proposed for long-period focusing is high-frequency 
TWTs which have very small-diameter electron beams and, with PPM focusing, 
require many very small magnets. For example, 50 or more small ring magnets are 
required for a millimeter-wave TWT. The cost of parts and of labor to assemble 
the parts is very high. Phillips et al. proposed the use of long-period focusing to 
reduce the parts count, the cost of parts, and the cost of labor to assemble the parts 
[9]. A portion of an LPF structure and the associated magnetic field produced by it 
is shown in Figure C-19. With this configuration, compared with PPM focusing, 
the number of ring magnets is reduced by a factor of 4. In the single period shown, 
a pair of saturable flux guides and four spacers replace the eight spacers that 
would be required by PPM focusing. Phillips et al. demonstrated the feasibility of 
LPF in tests on a 200-watt TWT. 
 
 
C.5   POLE PIECES  
 
In many of the preceding figures, reference to pole pieces has been made. The pole 
pieces must be capable of carrying the flux from the magnets to the electron beam. 
In low-frequency tubes, where dimensions are large and flux densities are modest, 
the flux densities in the pole pieces are modest. However, in high-frequency 
devices, where dimensions are small, the flux density in the pole pieces can be 
high enough so that saturation occurs. When saturation occurs, the flux passes 
through the pole piece material as if it was made of air and the field available for 
focusing the beam is degraded. To avoid this problem, the saturation flux density 
of the pole pieces must be as high as possible and the pole piece must be designed 
so that the flux density is below the saturation value. 
 
It is tedious but reasonably straightforward to estimate the flux density in the 
pole pieces and to determine if there is a danger of saturation [10, 11]. The flux 
density can be estimated if the operating point of the magnet is known and the 
dimensions of the magnetic circuit are known. To find the operating point of the 
magnet, the load line must be determined. To plot the load line, it is necessary to 
know the permeance of the magnet configuration.

where T is the magnet length and A is the cross-sectional area. 
 
Permeance depends very much on the position of the magnets relative to the 
pole pieces as indicated in Figure C-20. The configuration in Figure C-20(a) is 
representative of those used on helix TWTs. In coupled-cavity TWTs, the 
configuration is more like that shown in Figure C-20(b) or C-20(c). The pole 
pieces are the walls of the cavities and the magnets are at a radial distance that is 
large enough to make room for the cavities. As a result, P4 is a significant 
permeance. Permeances P5 and P6 depend largely on flux requirements and 
thermal considerations. 
 
The calculation of some of the permeances is straightforward. For example, 
referring to the dimensions in Figure C-21,

On the other hand, permeances P2 and P3 are not so easy to determine. To find 
these, boundary value problems must be solved using Fourier series involving 
Bessel functions as well as sine and cosine functions. 
 
After the permeances have been determined and the magnet load line has been 
established, the magnetic field that the pole pieces must support can be found. 
With the magnetic field and the pole piece dimensions, magnetic flux densities can 
be calculated. This is when the magnetic characteristics of the pole pieces must be 
known. As shown in Figure C-22, the saturation flux density for iron, which is 
commonly used, is about 21 kG. The highest saturation flux density material is 
vanadium  permendur which, in Figure C-22, is shown to be about 22 kG but is 
sometimes reported to be as high as 23 kG [12]. 
 
Before leaving the subjects of pole pieces and permanent magnets, we will 
briefly discuss the effect of magnetic objects on the focusing of an electron beam. 
In connection with Figure C-16, it was pointed out that ring-shaped magnets have 
to be broken in order to be placed on a tube. As a result, nonuniformities in the 
focusing field for the beam occur and magnetic shims are placed on the outside of 
the tube in an effort to compensate for the nonuniformities. 
 
It is important to realize that magnetic materials of any kind that are brought 
into close vicinity of a permanent magnet focused tube can affect the focusing of 
the beam. Magnetic tools are particularly dangerous, but even a small magnetic 
scrap like that shown in Figure C-23 can affect the beam trajectory and possibly 
destroy the tube. 
 
 
C.6   ELECTROMAGNETS 
 
A wire carrying a current produces a magnetic field as shown in Figure C-24. The 
direction of the field lines in relation to the direction of current flow can be 
remembered with the aid of the familiar right-hand rule. (The thumb points in the 
direction of conventional current and the fingers point in the direction of the field 
lines.) For microwave tube applications, the current carrying wire is formed into a 
solenoid, as shown in Figure C-25. 
 
Very close to each turn of the solenoid, the flux lines are nearly circular. 
However, at greater distances, the flux in the region between adjacent turns 
cancels, so the flux lines around each pair of turns are nearly elliptical. At still 
greater distances, there is further cancellation of opposing flux lines and the 
pattern in the center of Figure C-25 occurs. Near the middle of the solenoid, the 
flux lines are parallel and the flux density is constant. Near the ends of the 
solenoid, the flux lines diverge and the flux density decreases as indicated by the 
dashed line in Figure C-26. This large decrease in field near the ends of the 
solenoid is not acceptable for most microwave tube applications.

To enhance uniformity of the field on axis where the electron beam is to flow, 
magnetic pole pieces, as shown in Figure C-27, are used. The pole pieces have a 
high relative permeability (Î¼r â 5,000) and their effect is to strengthen the field 
near the ends of the solenoid as shown by the solid curve in Figure C-26. The 
magnetic behavior of the pole pieces is described in the following section.

Figure C-28 shows a typical solenoid for a TWT or klystron. Individual coils 
of the solenoid are separated to provide space for RF feedthroughs, cooling lines, 
and so forth. Normally, a solenoid is surrounded by a magnetic shield, or magnetic 
bars, as shown in Figure C-28, to provide a return path for flux lines. These 
magnetic shields do not enhance the magnetic flux density on the axis of the 
solenoid. Instead, they confine the magnetic flux lines surrounding a solenoid to a 
localized region near the solenoid. This helps minimize the possibility that a 
magnetic object, such as a tool, will accidentally be pulled toward the tube being 
focused by the solenoid, thus causing damage to, or destruction of, the tube. The 
magnetic shields or bars also help to minimize the interactions of the solenoid with 
nearby electrical circuits.

AM near-carrier noise: AM noise and spurious outputs at frequencies close to the 
carrier frequency, usually 100 Hz to 500 kHz relative to the carrier. Components 
not related to the presence of the carrier (signal) are usually caused by ripple on 
power supply voltages. Interactions in the TWT are usually responsible for 
components that exist only when a carrier (signal) is present. (See also 
near-carrier noise.) 
Amplitude pulling factor: The amount of gain change experienced when the VSWR 
of the input source or the load is changed. 
Amplitude pushing factor: The amount of gain change experienced as the voltage 
on a particular tube element is varied, usually expressed in dB/volt. 
AM/AM conversion: amplitude modulation to amplitude modulation conversion 
describes a type of distortion in microwave amplifiers. It is the change in the 
output RF voltage produced by variations in input signal level, usually expressed 
in dB/dB. An ideal amplifier has an AM/AM conversion of 1 dB/dB. As the 
amplifier approaches saturation, the amplification process becomes nonlinear and 
gain compression occurs. 
AM/PM conversion: amplitude modulation to phase modulation conversion 
describes a type of distortion in microwave amplifiers. It is the change in phase 
angle of the output RF voltage produced by variations in input signal level, 
usually expressed in degrees/dB. An ideal amplifier has an AM/PM conversion 
of 0 degrees/dB. 
AM/PM transfer: amplitude modulation to phase modulation transfer describes a 
type of distortion in microwave amplifiers. It is the change in phase of the output 
RF voltage on one signal produced by variations in input signal level on a signal 
at another frequency, usually expressed in degrees/dB.  
Amplitude shift keying (ASK): A form of digital modulation in which the amplitude 
of the carrier signal is switched between two states. 
b:  Pierceâs velocity parameter, b is a measure of actual beam velocity relative to 
synchronous beam velocity. 
Backstreaming: (1) A condition in which electrons reflected from the collector or 
secondary electrons from the collector travel âbackwardâ toward the electron 
gun. This is an undesirable effect, distorting the primary electron beam and any 
modulation that may be present. (2) A condition in which gas particles from a 
vacuum pump travel âbackwardâ into the chamber being pumped.

Backward wave oscillator (BWO): A wideband voltage tunable oscillator related to 
a traveling wave tube. It uses a broadband circuit similar to a TWT. Regeneration 
exists because the backward wave mode on the circuit propagates RF energy in a 
direction opposite to that of the electron stream. Oscillation occurs when the loop 
gain is equal to or greater than unity. High-power TWTs can experience 
undesired backward wave oscillations when the backward wave mode has 
sufficient regeneration. 
Barium: The primary emitting constituent of a dispenser cathode. 
Beam efficiency: (also called RF efficiency) The RF output power divided by the 
beam power. 
Beam power: The product of cathode voltage and cathode current. 
Body current: The part of the electron current from the gun that does not arrive at the 
collector. This current is intercepted by the RF circuit and other electrodes. 
Body-helix protection: A combination of circuit elements in the TWT power supply, 
ranging from a simple resistive network to a complex âcrowbarâ device. The 
circuitry is designed to prevent damage to the TWT as the result of arcing or 
unusually high body current. 
Brillouin field: See Brillouin focusing. 
Brillouin flow: Electron flow resulting from the use of Brillouin focusing. 
Brillouin focusing: A magnetic focusing scheme in which the magnetic field that 
provides focusing is parallel to the direction of electron flow and the electron gun 
is shielded from the magnetic field. The magnetic field required to focus an ideal 
beam is called the Brillouin field. 
Bunching: The result of the interaction of an electron beam with an RF field. 
Electrons which are accelerated by the field move toward those that have been 
decelerated, forming a high-density region usually referred to as a bunch. 
C: Pierceâs gain parameter, C is a measure of the effectiveness of the circuit in a 
TWT in interacting with the electron beam. 
Cathode loading: The current density at the emitting surface of the cathode, usually 
expressed in amperes per square centimeter. 
Cavity: A microwave-resonant circuit, usually consisting of a hollow metallic 
enclosure in which RF fields can be established at one or more frequencies.

tube delivers the RF power generated in the tube to the output connector.

Cold match: The input or output RF impedance match of a TWT obtained when the 
TWT is not operating (the TWT is electrically âcoldâ). 
Collector: The electrode that collects the spent electron beam after it has been used to 
provide power for microwave amplification or oscillation. The kinetic energy in 
the spent electron beam is converted to thermal energy (heat) in the collector or is 
recovered and returned to the power supply by the collector. 
Collector efficiency: The efficiency with which the collector recovers power from 
the spent beam. 
Confined flow: A type of beam focusing similar to Brillouin flow except that a small 
amount of magnetic flux is caused to thread the cathode. More field is required 
than for Brillouin flow, but the beam is less affected by RF bunching (less 
scalloping is introduced when RF is applied to the tube and body current is 
affected less by the application of RF drive). Confined flow is sometimes 
referred to as immersed flow. 
Confocal mirrors: For identical mirrors, the radius of curvature the mirrors is the 
distance between the mirrors. 
Contrawound helix: A helix slow-wave structure where two helices, wound in 
opposite directions, are superimposed into a single structure. This circuit offers 
substantially higher power than a conventional helix with some sacrifice of 
bandwidth. 
Control grid: An electrode, usually a gridlike structure, mounted between the 
cathode and the anode to control the flow of electrons. An appropriate negative 
voltage (with respect to the cathode) reduces the electron flow (beam current) to 
zero or cutoff and an appropriate positive (or, in some cases, less negative) 
voltage allows current to flow. This electrode is usually some sort of mesh 
structure. 
Coupled-cavity tube: A TWT with a slow-wave structure made up of a number of 
âcavitiesâ electrically coupled by means of coupling holes, slots, or loops. This 
circuit is capable of very high-power operation. 
Crossed-field device: A microwave tube in which the electric field between the 
cathode and anode is perpendicular to the magnetic field. The resulting average 
motion of the electrons emitted from the cathode is nearly perpendicular to both 
the electric and magnetic fields and parallel to the direction of propagation of 
energy on a nearby slow wave circuit. 
Current density: The current per unit area. For electrons in an electron beam, the 
current density is the beam current divided by the cross-sectional area of the 
beam. The current density at the cathode surface (cathode loading) is equal to the 
current divided by the surface area of the cathode and is usually expressed in 
amperes per square centimeter. 
Chemical vapor deposited diamond (CVD): Used as the output window for RF 
power on high-power high frequency microwave tubes and gyrotrons. 
d: Pierceâs loss parameter, d is a measure of the reduction in gain that occurs in a 
TWT as the result of circuit loss.

dBc: The level of a spurious output relative to the main signal (carrier) expressed in 
decibels below the carrier power level. 
dBm: Power level in decibels above a milliwatt; 60 dBm is a power level of 60 dB 
above a milliwatt and is a kilowatt. 
dBW: Power level in decibels above a watt; 60 dBW is a power level of 60 dB above 
a watt and is a megawatt. 
Denison mode converter: A  modification of the Vlasov converter, which is 
compact and can be placed between the gyrotron cavity and the output 
window. 
Density modulation: The process of controlling the density of electrons emitted from 
a cathode, usually, by a grid or other control electrode located near the cathode. 
Depressed collector: Collector depression is the process of applying a negative 
potential (with respect to the tube body or âgroundâ) to the collector to reduce the 
velocity of  electrons entering the collector. This reduces the kinetic energy of the 
electrons and so less energy is converted to heat and X-rays when the electrons 
impinge on the electrodes of the collector. The energy recovered from the 
electrons is returned to the power supply and so the conversion efficiency is 
greatly improved. A collector designed to operate in this mode is called a 
depressed collector. Depressed collectors can have one or more depressed stages. 
Multiple-stage depressed collectors use velocity sorting techniques to direct the 
high-velocity electrons to stages having the greatest depression and slow 
electrons to the stages having the least depression. 
Dispenser cathode: A cathode that has a body made of porous tungsten. The pores 
contain the active materials that enhance electron emission. When the cathode is 
heated to its operating temperature, the material in the pores migrates toward the 
emitting surface, continuously replenishing the supply of active material at the 
emitting surface. 
Dispersion: A term used to describe the variation in phase velocity of an RF wave 
with frequency. A nondispersive circuit propagates RF energy at a phase velocity 
that is independent of frequency. 
Drift tube: A section of metal tubing in which an electron beam âdriftsâ without 
being accelerated or decelerated by applied electric fields. 
Drive: A term to indicate the RF input or RF signal to an electronic device. 
Dual mode: Usually refers to devices capable of operating efficiently in both a low 
power CW mode and a high-power pulse mode. 
Duty cycle: The fraction of the time during which a device is operating. The term 
duty cycle is usually used with pulsed operation and is the product of pulsewidth 
and pulse repetition frequency. 
Dynamic range for linear operation: The range of operation of an amplifier in 
which the power output is nearly proportional to the power input. The lower limit 
is the input drive level at which the signal input is equal to the noise input plus 
the noise figure. The upper limit is the input drive level that produces 1 dB or 
less of gain compression.

Electronic efficiency: The efficiency with which dc beam power is converted to RF 
power at the desired frequency within a microwave tube. 
Electronic power conditioner (EPC): A power supply/modulator usually associated 
with space-qualified TWTAs. In addition to providing power, EPCs often 
include protection circuits, circuits for receiving commands, and circuits for

cylindrical-shaped ring or a section of wire screen or mesh. 
Group delay: The distortion that results when the time delay of a signal being 
processed is not constant as a function of frequency. Areas of interest are linear 
delay, parabolic delay, and the ripple component. The linear component is the

delay versus frequency. Ripple is the maximum peak-to-peak variation relative to 
a plot of the smoothed curve.

which adjacent cavities are electromagnetically coupled by two slots spaced 180Â° 
apart in the wall between the cavities. The slots in the walls of adjacent cavity are 
aligned. 
Insertion loss: The reduction in signal strength that results when a passive device is 
installed (inserted) into an RF transmission line. Insertion loss is caused by 
power being absorbed in the device and by reflections from discontinuities at the 
interfaces between the device and the transmission line. Usually expressed in 
decibels. 
Intercepting grid: A control grid that is not shielded from electrons emitted by the 
cathode. The grid intercepts approximately 10 to 15% of the emission current 
when a positive potential is applied. 
Intercept point: On a plot of intermodulation distortion data as a function of RF 
input drive, the carrier data at small signal drive levels has a slope of 1:1, third-
order intermodulation products have a slope of 3:1 and fifth-order 
intermodulation products have a slope of 5:1. Extrapolating the slopes for the 
carriers and the third-order products produces an intercept point. The output 
power at this point is called the third-order intercept point. Similarly, the fifth-
order intercept point is the point at which the carrier slope intercepts the fifth-
order product slope. (See also Intermodulation distortion.)

Intrinsic hysteresis loop: The magnetization characteristic of a ferromagnetic metal. 
Intrinsic efficiency: Efficiency calculated by dividing the RF output power from a 
microwave tube by the sum of all power provided with the exception of heater 
power and that provided to the solenoid for focusing the beam.

beam. Common types of klystrons are the reflex klystron (an oscillator having 
only one cavity), two-cavity klystron amplifiers and oscillators, and multicavity

an amplifier (causing the slope of power output versus power input to be nearly 1 
dB/dB over a wide range of drive levels). Linearizers are usually designed to also

and anode containing resonant cavities. An axial magnetic field causes electrons 
to orbit between the cathode and the anode. The RF voltages across gaps in the 
resonators modulate the velocities of the electrons. This causes the orbiting 
electrons to form into âspokesâ that rotate around the tube axis. As the spokes 
rotate past the resonator gaps, they induce currents that excite the cavities. The 
RF voltages build up to large levels. High-power output is obtained at high 
efficiency.

level. (See also dual mode.) 
Multioctave: Capable of operating satisfactorily over a frequency range of two or 
more octaves. 
Multipactor: An electron-RF field interaction in which electrons oscillate back and 
forth in synchronism with an RF voltage applied between electrodes. Secondary 
electrons produced when primary electrons strike the electrodes cause the 
number of oscillating electrons to increase with time. Multipactor is usually an 
undesirable effect and can occur across cavity or drift tube gaps, in output 
waveguides or on the surface of the ceramic output window.

responsible for components that exist only when a carrier (signal) is present.  
Noise figure: The ratio of the signal-to-noise on the output of a device to the signal-
to-noise on the input. It is important because it indicates the amount of noise the

of the device. Noise figure is usually expressed in decibels, and is abbreviated 
NF or F. 
Noise power: The noise generated by a device or amplifier when measured at the 
output port when the input port is terminated and no RF drive is applied. 
Noise power ratio (NPR): A measure of intermodulation when an infinite number of

Perveance depends only on the geometry of the diode. When the voltage is the 
cathode-to-anode voltage in the electron gun, the perveance is called the gun 
perveance. When the voltage is the cathode-to-circuit voltage, the perveance is 
called the beam perveance.

of devices. This is an important consideration when power combining the outputs 
from two or more devices. 
Phase velocity: The velocity at which phase fronts for an electromagnetic wave 
propagate. For a coaxial transmission line with no dielectric, the magnitude of 
the phase velocity is the speed of light. For a waveguide, the magnitude of the 
phase velocity is greater than the speed of light. Slow-wave circuits are designed 
to provide a phase velocity having a magnitude much less than the speed of light. 
PM near-carrier noise: PM (phase modulation) noise and spurious output at 
frequencies close to the carrier frequency, usually 100 Hz to 500 kHz relative to 
the carrier. Components not related to the presence of the carrier (signal) are

usually responsible for components that exist only when a carrier (signal) is 
present. (See also near-carrier noise.)

surface by high energy electrons. 
Serrodyne: An operating mode for a TWT in which the input signal is translated to a 
new frequency at the output. A sawtooth voltage is superimposed on the dc 
voltage between the cathode and the slow wave circuit, causing the phase shift in 
the TWT to change in a linear fashion as a function of time. The amplitude of the 
sawtooth voltage can be adjusted to provide 360Â° of phase shift during each 
cycle, causing the output of the TWT to be offset by the frequency of the 
sawtooth waveform (the âflybackâ time of the sawtooth must be very short so the 
TWT âthinksâ that the phase is being offset continuously). 
Shadow grid: A grid structure placed between the cathode and control grid and 
electrically connected to the cathode. This element shields the control grid from 
interception. 
Shot noise: Noise power generation in a vacuum tube resulting from the random

approximately uniform amplification over a band of frequencies. 
Staggered-slot structure: A fundamental backward wave coupled-cavity structure in 
which adjacent cavities are electromagnetically coupled by one opening or âslotâ 
in the wall between the cavities. The slots are rotated 180Â° from cavity wall to

wave structure to control reflections within a TWT. 
Tapered velocity: A change in the pitch of a helix, the height of cavities, or some 
other axial dimensions of a slow-wave circuit to change the phase velocity of the 
RF wave. This is done because the extraction of kinetic energy from the electron 
beam causes the beam to slow down near the output of the TWT. The taper helps 
to maintain synchronism between the RF wave and the electron beam, which 
improves the efficiency of the TWT. (See also DVT.) 
Temperature-limited operation: Operation of a cathode under conditions such that 
the cathode current depends on cathode temperature. 
Thermionic emission: The emission of electrons from a surface as the result of 
heating of the surface.

grid, and anode. In multimode TWTs, tetrode is a term describing the electron 
gun (cathode, shadow grid, control grid, and screen grid).

microwave tubes operate at pressures below 10â7 torr.
