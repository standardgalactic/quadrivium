Transliteration conventions
1 Capital letters indicate an alternative version of the sound. 
• In the case of D, S, T and Z an emphatic sound is produced by putting
your tongue further back against the roof of your mouth, for example in
a similar position to where it might be for the English word ‘dull’ (as
opposed to ‘dill’).
• In the case of H, the sound is a breathy ‘h’, as if you are breathing on
glasses to polish them.
2 The raised c indicates the Arabic guttural sound, a kind of ‘ah’ produced
from the stomach. Words beginning with c can be found alphabetized 
after Z in the glossary.
3 ‘kh’ is used for the sound made while clearing your throat similar to the
Scottish ‘ch’ as in ‘loch’.
4 ‘gh’ is used for a throaty ‘r’ as in the French ‘rue’.
5 ‘dh’ is used for a hard ‘th’ as in ‘that’ (in contrast to ‘thin’).
Acknowledgments
We would like to thank Dr Mohammed al-Obaydi for his invaluable help with
the Iraqi Arabic phrases and explanations.

medicine from the pharmacy?
Fairuz 
I don’t know. Ask the pharmacist about the appropriate
medicine.
Tareq 
You take it easy, and I’ll come back straight away. 
Pharmacist Hello and welcome. Can I help you, sir? 
Tareq 
My wife is sick and I don’t know what’s the matter 
with her. 
Pharmacist What are the symptoms, please? 
Tareq 
Her face is pale and she feels dizzy and has a
headache.
Pharmacist Is there any temperature? Does she have diarrhoea? 
Tareq 
No, but yesterday we were on a boat in the sun. 
Pharmacist I have some medicine for sunstroke. A pill every four
hours. 
Tareq 
Anything else, doctor? 
Pharmacist Lots of water and complete rest.

Cultural information
Greetings
In informal situations first name terms are used. If the situation is
more formal, family names are also used when people are being
introduced. For official purposes, Arabs will use their father’s name to
identify themselves more precisely, even if they are a woman.
There are many Arabic greetings for different situations. It’s best to
stick to the simpler, all-purpose phrases at first. Amongst the most
common are ahlan and yaa hala (hello), marHab (welcome) and the
well-known greeting as-salaamu calaykum (Peace be on you).
Public transport
Public transport systems vary throughout the Middle East, in terms
of availablility, cost and efficiency. However, the ubiquitous taxi is the
one predictable and reliable method of getting around. Meters are
not always used or available and it’s often better to negotiate a fare
in advance. You’ll need to ask someone with local knowledge of the
particular area to establish what the going rate is. 
Accommodation
The Arabic for hotel is fundug (also pronounced fundu’) or otayl. In
many parts of the Middle East you will find the well-known
international hotel chains. The front-desk staff in these hotels will
generally have a reasonable level of English. But this might not be
true of other employees or of smaller hotels off the beaten tourist
track. In any case, a few words of Arabic will help create a good
initial impression, even if the conversation then continues in English. 
Food
The universal word for ‘bread’ in Arabic is khubz, but in Egypt it is
also referred to as caysh, literally meaning ‘life’. The most popular
bread in Egypt is flat, large pitta-type bread: either baladi
(wholemeal ‘countryside’ bread) or shaami (‘Syrian’ bread made 
from white flour). The two traditional types of cheese are abyaD or
bayDa ‘white’ cheese – a soft, feta-type cheese, and roomi – a hard 
cheese resembling Parmesan. 
22

Jewellery
Gold and silver jewellery in the souk is usually sold by weight,
according to the quality or number of carats. Sometimes there is also
an allowance made for craftsmanship. You will almost certainly get a
discount by engaging in some friendly haggling, but beware of being
unrealistic in how much you expect the owner to reduce the price. 
Khan il-khalili
Khan il-khalili is a huge souk in the heart of old Cairo. It is a classic
Arab bazaar with narrow streets and medieval alleys lined with shops
and stalls selling everything from tourist trinkets, perfume and
jewellery to pot and pans, furniture and rugs. Originally the streets
were organized by craft – coppersmiths, silversmiths, fabric sellers,
spice merchants, etc. However, the current bazaar is more mixed
and tourist-oriented.
Eating out
Middle Eastern food is varied and heavily influenced by Greek and
Turkish cuisine. As well as the ubiquitous global fast-food chains,
you can find tasty traditional snacks such as falafel, beans, kebabs,
tahini and chick peas. A full meal in a restaurant will also usually
involve meat or fish – sometimes fried or grilled and sometimes in a
stew with vegetables such as okra or peas. Desserts are often very
sweet and not for the calorie conscious, who may prefer to sample 
the local fruits.
Islamic marriages
Islamic marriages can have several stages, with a ceremony
attached to each. Initially, the groom asks for the bride’s hand in
marriage. If he’s accepted, he’ll lock hands with the bride’s father
and together they will recite the opening verse of the Qu’ran, known
as the fatHa. This will later be followed by an engagement, which will
include exchanging rings and gifts in a bigger gathering of family and
friends. Finally katb il-kitaab (‘signing of the book’) and the actual
wedding, il-faraH, usually takes place on the same festive night. If
you’re lucky enough to be invited to any of these celebrations, you
should take a small gift for the bride and groom.
23

Beach resorts
Beach resorts on the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf offering sun, sand,
water sports and coral reefs are becoming increasingly popular with
sun-worshipping tourists and they’re big business for the countries
involved. Of course, many visitors will drop in for a week or two and
get by without any Arabic – almost everyone in the resorts will speak
at least some English. But you’ll be surprised at how much a little
Arabic can loosen up a conversation, even if you end up reverting to
English after a while. 
Falling ill
In hot climates, be careful not to expose yourself to the sun in the
middle of the day. In summer it’s better to follow the lead of the
locals and stay out of the sun during the hottest part of the day.
There’s a reason why people live much of their lives in the evening!
Should you feel unwell, a pharmacist will be able to help you with
most minor ailments, or help you to find a doctor should that be
necessary. Most doctors speak good English.
Saying goodbye
Most Middle Eastern men have no problem with kissing each other
on the cheeks or forehead when they meet or as they say goodbye.
This overt physical intimacy may seem strange to a European, but it
is considered normal among Arabs.
