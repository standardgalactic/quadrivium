Preface
The burgeoning popularity of space-time adaptive processing (STAP) is eas-
ily demonstrated with a quick keyword search. Although originally coined 
for airborne multichannel moving target indicator (MTI) radar [1, 2], the 
acronym has been adopted in many disciplines in which joint adaptive sen-
sor temporal and spatial processing are performed (e.g., multidimensional 
adaptive filtering). Although a widely published topic, there is a void in cov-
erage at the introductory to intermediate level—a niche which this book is 
designed to address.
Multichannel space-time array processing is an extremely rich topic area 
in and of itself [3]. When coupled with the modern marvel of a radar system, 
it is doubtful that any single source could come close to providing compre-
hensive coverage. In selecting both the scope and treatment for this book, I 
had the benefit of having taught both introductory and advanced courses on 
STAP for radar for several years in industry, academia, and the IEEE Radar 
Conference series. The audience for such courses is extremely diverse, rang-
ing from pure theoretical academicians to the working engineer trying to 
implement STAP on time and on budget (and most occupation categories 
in between). Moreover, such forums were generally quite time constrained, 
placing a premium on efficient teaching methods.
Introduction to Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar is my attempt 
to distill the many lessons learned from not only my teaching experiences, but 
from my interactions with many esteemed colleagues and my own research. 

xii	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
My overarching goal was to take the reader equipped with a basic foundation 
in radar, electromagnetics, and signal processing from basic adaptive array 
principles to the state-of-the-art in STAP algorithm design.
Echoing in my psyche during the creation of this treatment was the 
often-cited student goal: “How do I make STAP work in the real world?” The 
source of such pleas was often the disappointing results achieved when STAP 
methods were blindly applied to challenging—albeit realistic—interference 
environments. A forensic analysis of such results invariably revealed that the 
root cause of failure was an extreme oversimplification of the nature of the 
underlying interference.
For example, in the derivation of the optimum space-time beamformer, 
stationarity assumptions are imposed that are generally not met in practice 
(except, of course, in highly contrived scenarios—e.g., a flat uninhabited 
desert). Thus, after establishing basic 1st order space-time models for clutter 
and jamming in Chapter 3, many important 2nd and higher order effects are 
detailed in Chapter 4 before introducing modern STAP algorithms in Chapter 
5. The obvious reason for this is simply that many algorithms perform very 
well on 1st order models, but can produce disappointing results when higher 
fidelity models and/or real data is employed. This effect is exacerbated as the 
strength of the interference increases—precisely the situation one wants to 
remedy with STAP!
At the time first edition of this book was written, the only books available 
devoted to STAP for radar were by Klemm [2, 4]. I have copies of both and 
refer to them often (as evidenced throughout this book). However, these are 
advanced treatments and thus are not readily accessible to the newly initiated. 
Moreover, due to their enormous breadth of coverage, particular topics are 
not always explored in great depth. Thus, to even come close to accomplish-
ing my aforementioned objectives in a single source, sacrifices in breadth had 
to be made. For example, I have chosen not to explicitly cover bistatic STAP 
or newly emerging application areas in synthetic aperture radar (SAR)—top-
ics that are covered in [2, 4]. However, many of the robust STAP algorithms 
developed in Chapter 5 are applicable to these more advanced applications. 
Indeed, it is my hope that after completing Chapter 5, the motivated reader 
could simply learn the particulars of another application, and then readily 
adopt a suitable STAP algorithm from their toolkit.
I have been extremely fortunate to have had first-hand interactions and 
collaborations with some of the founding fathers of both the theory of STAP, 
Professors Irving S. Reed and Dante C. Youla, who derived the multichan-
nel Wiener-Hopf equations in continuous form in 1959! [5] and its practical 
implementation (e.g., Marshall Greenspan). Their alacrity and clarity are truly

acknowledge the gentle yet firm encouragement and assistance of my editor, 
Ms. Barbara Lovenvirth of Artech House.
STAP is a vast field and I have benefited over the years from so many 
generous colleagues that have also directly and/or indirectly influenced the 
material in this book. I cannot not possibly mention them all, but feel espe-
cially compelled to mention M. Zatman, M. Wicks, P. Zulch, E. Baranoski, 
J. Ward, A. Farina, and J. Carlini.
Preface to the Second Edition
Since the publication of the first edition over ten years ago, there has been a 
great deal of new adaptive radar developments, including multi-input/multi-
output (MIMO), knowledge-aided (KA) processing, adaptive waveform and 
transmit techniques (i.e., fully adaptive radar), and the newly-emerging field of 
cognitive radar. As a consequence, two new chapters have been added to this 
second edition to provide firm foundation of STAP on transmit techniques 
and applications, along with the latest in knowledge-aided (KA) methods and 
architectures. Thus, when taken in its entirety, Space Time Adaptive Processing 
for Radar, Second Edition provides the necessary tools for the practicing engi-
neer and researcher engaged in the latest state-of-the-art radar developments.
Lastly, problem sets have been introduced at the end of each chapter to 
facilitate the adoption of this book in more formal coursework, as well as to 
provide additional stimulation of problems outside those specifically addressed 
within the chapters.

Introduction
1.1	 The Need for STAP in MTI Radar
As mentioned in the preface, space-time adaptive processing (STAP), which 
was a term originally used for airborne multichannel moving target indica-
tor (MTI) radar [1, 2], has been adopted in many disciplines beyond radar 
in which joint adaptive sensor temporal and spatial processing are performed 
(e.g., multidimensional adaptive filtering). Though our focus is radar in this 
book, virtually all of the techniques discussed have counterparts in other 
applications from sonar to lidar.
The need for joint space and time processing in either airborne or space-
borne MTI radar arises from the inherent two-dimensional, angle-Doppler 
nature of ground clutter when observed from a moving platform. The dis-
tribution of ground clutter (power spectral density arising from the two-way 
antenna pattern) for a sidelooking radar employing a uniform linear array 
(ULA—see Chapter 2) as a function of normalized angle (i.e., the spatial 
dimension) and normalized Doppler (temporal dimension)—as defined in 
Chapter 2—is illustrated in Figure 1.1. Notice that, in the absence of both 
ownship platform motion (v = 0 case in Figure 1.1) and internal clutter motion 
(ICM—see Chapter 4), the ground clutter returns have no Doppler shift and 
can thus be characterized by a simple one-dimensional process. That is, the 
filtering of ground clutter can be achieved by simply rejecting signals from the

“0-Hz” Doppler filter [3, 4]. Moving targets are thus detected by looking for 
the presence of signals (of sufficient strength) in the remaining Doppler filters.
However, when ownship motion is present, ground returns are Doppler 
shifted according to the relationship [1, 2]
	
fd = bq 	
(1.1)
where q  and fd  are the normalized angle and Doppler respectively (see Chap-
ter 3), and β is a proportionality constant that depends on ownship speed, pulse 
repetition frequency (PRF), and array interelement spacing (see Chapter 3).
As illustrated in Figure 1.1, ownship velocity gives rise to 2-D clutter 
ridges whose slope is governed by (1.1). Moreover, due to the Nyquist frequency 
of ±PRF/2 [3], there may be more than one distinct ridge due to Doppler alias-
ing [1, 2]. As a consequence, it is likely that for every target of interest, there 
is a region of ground clutter with the same Doppler frequency—but offset 
in angle—that potentially could mask the target through either sidelobe or 
mainlobe leakage [1, 2]. The objective of space-time processing is to place a 
null in the angle-Doppler beampattern where clutter may compete. Due to 
the aforementioned 2-D nature of clutter, this null will depend on the target 
angle-Doppler of interest [1, 2].
While (1.1) establishes the basic need for space-time (angle-Doppler) 
processing, it in no way implies the need for adaptivity. Since it is conceiv-
able to know the relative orientation of the radar and ground surface through 
ownship inertial navigation systems (INS) and GPS, as well as basic ground 
topology and clutter prediction maps [5], one could simply steer a determin-
istic null in the predicted clutter direction (see (1.2) below). Unfortunately, a 
multitude of practical, real-world considerations severely limit the efficacy of 
this technique. Indeed, many of these considerations are both the impetus and 
subject matter of this book. Examples of such considerations include chan-
nel mismatch, clutter heterogeneity/nonstationarity, internal clutter motion 
(ICM), and other interference subspace leakage (ISL) mechanisms (see Chap-
ters 2 through 4). These real-world effects give rise to the inherent need for 
adaptivity—hence STAP!
1.2	 STAP for MTI Radar
Figure 1.2 shows the basic schematic architecture of a STAP beamformer. For 
ease of analysis, we will nominally consider an N-element ULA and a coherent 
processing interval (CPI) consisting of M-pulses with a fixed pulse repetition 
interval (PRI) (as notionally depicted in Figure 1.2)—though many of the

Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
concepts and techniques discussed are readily extensible to nonuniform/non-
linear [6] arrays and variable PRFs (see Chapters 4 and 5). As with ordinary 
1-D spatial-only beamforming, a 2-D angle-Doppler (space-time) beampat-
tern can be formed by a judicious selection of the complex linear combiner 
weights {wi} [1, 2].
As discussed in Chapter 2 (and elsewhere [7]), to maximize the response 
(and/or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) to a uniform narrowband plane wave cor-
responding to a given angle and Doppler, the linear combiner weight vector 
w = vec(w1, … , wNM), (where vec( ) is the vector operator that simply forms 
an NM-dimensional column vector from the NM elements w1, … , wNM), 
should be set equal to the anticipated structure of the desired signal s; for 
example, w = s (see Chapter 2 for further details). For the ideal ULA example 
under consideration, the result is the 2-D sinc pattern shown in Figure 1.3. 
Note the presence of a peak mainlobe and both angle and Doppler sidelobes, 
which for a sinc pattern, may be unacceptably high. Although tapering or 
windowing can be used to reduce these sidelobes, they come at the expense 
of an increase in mainlobe width and a decrease in SNR. Moreover, channel 
mismatch places further limitations on the amount of tapering possible (this 
will be covered in greater detail in Chapter 2).
Figure 1.2  Space-time (angle-Doppler) beamformer consisting of N independent 
antenna channels and M pulses comprising the coherent processing interval (CPI). A 
specific angle-Doppler pattern is obtained by judicious selection of the complex linear 
combiner weights. See Chapter 3 for further details.

	
Introduction

As detailed in Chapter 2, a linear combiner of this type has NM degrees-
of-freedom (DOFs). Thus, for a desired angle-Doppler look direction s, we can 
also specify up to NM − 1 nulls. Specifically, if the set of NM angle-Doppler 
vectors {s,j1, … , jNM–1} are linearly independent [8], then a deterministic set 
of beamformer weights can be obtained from the linear set of equations (see 
Chapter 2):
	
w¢s = 1
w¢j1 = 0

w¢jNM = 0
	
(1.2)
Unfortunately, due to the relative strength of potential interference (clutter 
and/or jamming), and the aforementioned practical limitations on determin-
istic nulling, this approach is untenable in practice [1, 2]. Instead, the radar

community has looked towards statistical signal processing for a means of 
addressing the limitations of deterministic nulling. In particular, clutter and/
or jamming is treated as a stochastic process, and the optimum space-time 
beamformer is derived via a statistical optimization procedure [1, 2]. Although 
there are many variations on the theme (many of which are described in this 
text), the basic underlying optimum beamformer result is given by
	
w = R–1s	
(1.3)
where, as before, s is the desired signal and w is the optimal set of combiner 
weights. R is the positive definite NM × NM dimensional covariance matrix 
associated with the total interference (clutter plus jamming plus receiver noise) 
for the given range cell under test. Since we have already stipulated that it is 
not possible to characterize the space-time interference a priori with sufficient 
precision to effect adequate nulling, it may at first appear that (1.3) is a mere 
tautology. However, under conditions discussed in Chapters 3 and 4 (and 
elsewhere [9]), it may be possible to estimate R from sample data obtained in 
the normal course of radar operation. Indeed, it is the estimation of R on-the-
fly that is the true basis for the inclusion of the word adaptive in STAP [1, 2].
However, as will be made precise in Chapters 2–5, great care may be 
required in practice to glean the essential information from the environment 
because the amount of data available for estimating R is fundamentally limited 
not only by the resolution properties of the radar, but to the environment itself 
[10]. This latter consideration is particularly acute in highly heterogeneous and 
nonstationary terrain that can be expected to occur in a variety of potential 
real-world operating conditions [5, 10, 11]. It is the intention of this book 
to introduce the reader to an important cross section of these issues and to 
introduce STAP methods that have the potential of meeting those challenges.
A clear illustration of the conspicuous differences between real-world and 
synthetic (or mathematically idealized) ground clutter is afforded by examina-
tion of the radar returns from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 
(DARPA) Mountain Top radar [12], shown in Figure 1.4. Although ground 
based, this airborne MTI radar operation was emulated by a so-called inverse 
displaced phase center array (IDPCA) technique wherein successive pulses 
were transmitted from a different phase center along the uniform linear array 
(ULA) [12]. Thus, as far as ground clutter was concerned, the illumination 
appeared to be moving.
In Figures 1.5 (a)–(b), the processed returns as a function of range and Doppler 
are shown for both the actual radar and a simulation based on a homogenous 
clutter assumption [5]. The radar was situated at the White Sands Missile

Range (WSMR). It is clearly not hard to imagine the mismatch pitfalls that 
await the unsuspecting radar engineer if care is not taken to properly segment 
the returns for both training (estimating the covariance—see Chapter 5), as 
well as establishing a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection scheme [13].
1.3	 New to the Second Edition
In addition to revisions of Chapters 1–6 (including the introduction of end 
of chapter problem sets), two new chapters have been added in this new edi-
tion. The increasing digitization of the transmit side of a modern radar has 
afforded a fresh new look at introducing adaptivity on transmit. In Chapter 
7, we introduce the basic theory of STAP on Transmit and show how it can

be applied to a large variety of problems from increasing rejection of inter-
ference to enhanced target ID. In Chapter 8, recent advances in advanced 
knowledge-aided (KA) processing are introduced; these advances allow for 
far more sophisticated types of adaptation than can be achieved by strictly 
sample statistic based approaches. A variety of KA-STAP techniques and 
architectures are also introduced and applied to both high-fidelity synthetic 
and real-world data sets.
The addition of these two new chapters—along with those from the 
first edition—provides a solid foundation for newly emerging capabilities and 
architectures, including the recently emerging cognitive radar systems that are 
poised to achieve unprecedented new capabilities [14, 15].
1.4	 Book Organization
Chapter 2 introduces the basic concepts of adaptive array processing by first 
considering the 1-D ULA case. Surprisingly, many of the issues that are at the

forefront in advanced STAP research—such as convergence and robust adap-
tivity in heterogeneous and nonstationary environments—can be introduced 
with the 1-D case. After introducing the basic operation of a 1-D phased array, 
an optimum beamformer that maximizes the total signal-to-interference-
plus-noise-ratio (SINR) is derived. This formulation introduces the concept 
of the interference covariance matrix R. Next, since R is not known a priori in 
practice, the concept of an adaptive array is introduced as a practical attempt 
to estimate R on-the-fly from the assumed to be available sensor data. Proper-
ties of the sample covariance-based adaptive beamformer are examined via an 
eigenanalysis of the adaptive beamformer. This leads to the introduction of 
the method of principal components to help alleviate the potentially deleteri-
ous effects of finite sample estimates [16]. Finally, a covariance augmentation 
technique referred to as covariance matrix tapers (CMTs) is introduced, and is 
used to illustrate a potential solution to the so-called stale weights problem [17].
Chapter 3 introduces the basic underlying signals and interference models 
for space-time adaptive processing for airborne MTI radar. Again, beginning 
with a ULA radar, the basic 2-D properties of ground clutter are developed 
along with a derivation of Brennan’s rule that provides an analytical esti-
mate of the underlying rank of the clutter covariance matrix. The optimum 
space-time beamformer is then derived and applied to a notional N = M = 
16 sidelooking ULA radar. As with the 1-D case, the optimum beamformer 
requires knowledge of the total interference covariance matrix. However, the 
dimensionality of the space-time covariance is dramatically greater (due to the 
Kronecker relationship of angle and Doppler)—thus exacerbating the conver-
gence/implementation issues introduced with 1-D adaptive array processing.
Next, in Chapter 4, important refinements to the signal models intro-
duced in Chapter 3 are detailed. These factors can have a profound deleteri-
ous impact on STAP performance in practice, and must therefore be properly 
accounted for in the beginning design stages. Factors considered include chan-
nel mismatch (narrow and finite bandwidth), internal clutter motion (ICM), 
antenna crabbing, and other interference subspace leakage (ISL) effects, as 
well as clutter heterogeneity.
In Chapter 5, a broad class of STAP algorithms is presented and tax-
onomized based on their fundamental formulation. Emphasis is placed on 
those techniques that make the most efficient use of the adaptive DOFs of 
the STAP processor. The primary objective of Chapter 5 is to provide a pal-
let of techniques that can be combined and tailored to a specific application 
in order to maximize STAP efficiency—loosely defined as maximizing con-
vergence rate (minimizing requisite sample support), yet closely preserving 
near-optimal performance. The chapter culminates with a design example in 

10

which the requisite sample support for a sample matrix-based STAP proces-
sor is reduced by an order-of-magnitude, with commensurate computational 
reductions in the adaptation process.
In Chapter 6, some important additional topics are discussed. In Section 
6.2, the statistical basis for STAP is introduced. For the additive Gaussian 
noise (AGN) case, it is shown that the max SINR (or minimum MSE) space-
time beamformer based on the total interference covariance matrix is indeed 
optimal in the statistical sense (e.g., maximum likelihood sense [7]). Refer-
ences are provided for the reader interested in exploring the latest research 
trends related to non-Gaussian extensions of relevance to STAP. In Section 
6.3, basic real-time implementation issues are discussed with an emphasis on 
the popular data domain QR factorization approach [18]. This formulation 
leads to an extremely efficient parallel processing implementation of the sample 
matrix inverse (SMI). Due to its ubiquitous adoption, we have extended it to 
include both diagonal loading and covariance matrix tapering (CMT)—the 
latter covariance augmentation being of value in implementing a class of robust 
STAP algorithms introduced in Chapter 5.
Chapter 7 introduces the relatively new concept of STAP on Transmit, 
which is the application of spatio-temporal adaptivity to the transmit degrees-
of-freedom. The basic adaptive multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) theory 
for optimizing detection and identification is introduced along with several 
diverse applications.
Lastly, Chapter 8 provides an introduction to the field of knowledge-
aided (KA) processing in general and KA-STAP in particular. Here, far more 
sophisticated types of adaptation are introduced as compared to conventional 
sample statistic-based approaches. It allows for the incorporation of a vast array 
of potentially useful environmental knowledge sources, such as digital terrain 
maps, road networks, background traffic, and weather.
This new edition provides the reader with a solid grounding in both 
traditional STAP theory and applications and elements of the very latest 
developments in fully adaptive and cognitive radar [14, 15].

Adaptive Array Processing
2.1	 Introduction
In this chapter we introduce both optimum and adaptive, spatial (angle) and 
temporal (Doppler) processing. Many of the key concepts and issues in STAP 
can be readily grasped by first successively examining the 1-D constituent 
angle and Doppler processing chains. In Chapter 3, we consider the joint 
spatiotemporal (2-D) process required for advanced clutter suppression in 
airborne radars and other applications.
2.2	 Optimum Spatial (Angle) Beamforming
Consider the effect of a unit-amplitude, narrowband electromagnetic (EM) 
plane wave impinging on an N-element ULA with interelement spacing d, as 
depicted in Figure 2.1. In this context, the term narrowband refers to a signal 
whose modulation bandwidth, B, is such that c/B >> Nd [1]. This condition 
insures that propagation delay across the array is manifested as a simple phase 
shift [see (2.1)]. The impact of non-negligible bandwidth will be addressed 
in Chapter 4.
If we define the plane wave angle of arrival (AoA), θ0, relative to boresight 
as shown in Figure 2.1, the complex envelope phasor at baseband observed at 
the nth antenna element as a function of θ 0 is

r = xix + yiy + ziz [1]. Note that the phase progression of a plane wave is linear 
across a ULA. The impact of a nonlinear array geometry for airborne MTI 
radar is discussed in Chapter 4.
By introducing multiplicative complex weighting factors, wn, in each 
receive channel of the array (as shown in Figure 2.1), the output response can 
be maximized for any desired AoA. More specifically, let y denote the scalar 
beamformer output defined as

To maximize the response of the beamformer to a plane wave arriving 
at an AoA of θ 0, we have the following elementary optimization problem:
	
max
{w} y
2 = max
{w} w¢s
2
subject to w 2 = constant < ∞
	
(2.5)
where the constant gain constraint is imposed to insure a finite solution. Since 
w′s is simply an inner (or dot) product of the two nonzero norm vectors w 
and s [2], Schwarz’s inequality can be applied [2, 3]; that is, ⎪w′s⎪2 ≤ ‖w‖
2‖s‖
2, 
with equality if (and only if) the vectors are colinear. This yields the result
	
w = κs	
(2.6)
where κ is a scalar chosen to satisfy the normalization constraint.
This result is intuitive inasmuch as it states that the optimum beam-for-
mer applies phase corrections to each channel to compensate for the time delays 
associated with the plane wave traveling across the array. More specifically, at the 
nth channel, the beamformer forms the product wn
* sn ∝e−jαne jαn = 1, thereby 
canceling the phase term. The beamformer thus coherently integrates the sig-
nal outputs from each channel [1]. Without this compensation, destructive

interference would occur with a commensurate decrease in output signal 
strength.
An important and fundamental limitation of linear beamformers is that 
they will also, in general, respond to signals arriving from other angles. This 
can lead to many practical problems, as strong unwanted signals from other 
directions can interfere with the signal of interest. To visualize this effect, 
consider the response of the above beamformer to plane waves arriving from 
−90° to +90° with w = κs, where s is chosen to be a plane wave with AoA of 
θ 0.If we let xn denote the output of the nth receive channel (and x ∈ ℂN the 
corresponding vector of received values), then the total beamformer output, 
steered to angle θ 0, is given by

while varying θ from −90° to +90°, the beamformer response of Figure 2.2 
results (with κ = 1). Note that for a ULA, the beamformer response can be 
obtained via a fast Fourier transform (FFT) [1]. For this particular example, 
an analytical expression for the normalized beamformer response (⎪y⎪ ≤ 1) 
exists and is given by [1] (see Appendix 2A)

The beamformer response of Figure 2.2 has several interesting features. 
First, note that signals close to 30° also produce a significant response. This 
region is generally referred to as the main lobe. The lobing structures outside 
of the main lobe region are referred to as sidelobes. For the ULA considered, 
the first near-in sidelobe is approximately 13 dB down from the peak of the 
main lobe [1]. The null-to-null width of the main lobe for a ULA depends on 

	
Adaptive Array Processing
17
the number of elements, N (i.e., the antenna length), and the scan angle, θ 0. 
It is easily obtained by setting Np d
l sin(q) −sin(q0)
(

θ MB, which is the first null. The null-to-null width is thus given by
	
qMB = 2sin−1

In modern radar systems, the presence of strong targets, clutter, and

weaker target of interest. There are basically two approaches to combat these 
effects: array tapering [1] and adaptive beamforming [4].
Tapering is accomplished by applying an amplitude (positive and real) 
weighting vector t ∈ ℝN
+ across the array, such as the 40-dB Chebyshev taper 
illustrated in Figure 2.3 (for more details on antenna tapering, see [1]). Math-
ematically, this is tantamount to replacing the untapered beamformer weight, 
w = s, with w = s ○ t, where ○ denotes the Hadamard product or elementwise 
matrix multiplication [2], which in general is defined as

where A, B, C ∈ ℂn×m, and the ijth element of C is given by cij = aijbij. In words, 
given two conformal matrices of dimension n × m, the Hadamard product A 
○ B = C is an n × m matrix whose elements are the pairwise products of the 
corresponding elements of A and B. Note that the output of the beamformer 
y in (2.7) can be expressed as a Hadamard product of the form
	
y = [1  1  …  1](w∗ ○ s)	
(2.13)
where ∗ denotes conjugation without transposition, and [1  1  …  1] is a 
1 × N row vector (Hadamard identity row vector) that acts as the summer 
operator. Note that the Hadamard product in parenthesis must be performed 
first for the expression to have meaning.
Figure 2.3(b) shows the resulting tapered patterns, normalized to a peak 
gain of unity, for two Chebyshev weighting schemes. Although sidelobe levels 
are significantly reduced, there is an increase in the main lobe width and a 
corresponding loss in gain [1] (see discussion on impact of tapering on SNR). 
Also, there are practical limitations to the amount of tapering possible due 
to ever-present channel-mismatch errors [1]. Further details on the impact 
of various forms of channel mismatch are discussed in Chapter 4. As we 
will see, adaptive beamforming has the potential to overcome some of these 
disadvantages.

	
Adaptive Array Processing

Adaptive beamforming attempts to take advantage of the spatial DoFs 
afforded by a phased array by adapting the pattern (i.e., the weights, wn) in 
real time. The adaptive beamformer thus attempts to steer pattern nulls in 
the direction of the interference. The nulls must be determined adaptively as, 
in general, the direction of the interference is not known a priori. In practice, 
adaptive beamforming techniques are the practical attempt to implement 
Figure 2.3  (a) Example of a 40-dB Chebyshev taper function for a 16-element ULA, and 
(b) resulting beam patterns for two different Chebyshev tapers. Note the broadening of 
the main lobe.

optimum beamforming methods. We thus begin by examining the following 
optimization problem.
2.2.1  Derivation of the Optimum Beamformer
Consider the response of a ULA beamformer to signal s ∈ ℂN plus additive 
interfering signals which we will simply refer to as noise, n ∈ ℂN. There are 
many potential sources of noise: clutter, jamming (intentional or not), and 
ever-present thermal or receiver noise [5]. However, for the moment, we will 
simply lump these signals into a single term n. Since the array response is 
linear, the output is given by
	
y = w′s + w′n = ys + yn	
(2.14)
where n is a zero-mean, finite-variance, vector random variable (RV) [6].
Our objective is to maximize, in some appropriate sense, the signal 
response while simultaneously minimizing the response due to noise. A ubiq-
uitously employed metric in radar (and many other sensor) applications is SNR 
[7], which, for the known signal-in-noise case, is defined as
	
SNR 
ys
2
E
yn

{

(2.15)
where E{⎪yn⎪2} is the expected value of the magnitude squared noise response 
[6], which formally, is given by [6]

(2.16)
where fy(y) is the probability density function (pdf) associated with the RV yn. 
SNR is thus a measure of the signal power to the average noise power. Since 
w is not random, the expectation operation E{⋅} only acts on n as follows [6]:

21
where
	
R  E{nn′} ∈ ℂN×N	
(2.18)
is the covariance matrix associated with n (assumed to be zero-mean). In 
Chapter 6, we will see that maximizing SNR is also optimum in a rigorous 
statistical setting for the additive Gaussian noise case.
2.2.2  Case I: Additive White Noise
We first consider the case when the only competing interference is so-called 
white noise, which is typical of thermal receiver noise [5]. For this case, R = 
σ2I, where I is the N × N identity matrix, and the scalar σ2 is the receiver noise 
variance, which is assumed to be the same in each channel. For thermal receiver 
noise, σ 2 = kTeffB, where k is Boltzmann’s constant 1.38 ×10−23

Teff is the effective temperature in absolute degrees Kelvin, and B is the receiver 
bandwidth in hertz [5]. For this case, we have

w¢Rw = max

subject to w¢w = 1
	
(2.19)
The unity norm constraint is chosen for both convenience and to insure 
a finite solution. Substitution of the constraint into the primary objective 
function yields the equivalent optimization problem

(2.20)
which is mathematically identical to the maximum-output deterministic 
beamformer of (2.5); that is,
	
w = κs	
(2.21)
where to meet the unity gain constraint in (2.19), κ = 1/
N (although this 
scalar does not effect the SNR as shown below).

22	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
This is also known as the matched filter solution for the white-noise 
case [7]. It is certainly interesting to note that the solution to (2.9), which 
accounts for noise, is identical to the solution obtained for simply maximizing 
the beamformer response. Intuitively this makes sense since white noise has 
no spatial structure and is completely uncorrelated. Consequently, the DoFs 
are best utilized maximizing the signal response and allowing the summa-
tion operation to average out the noise. Moreover, from (2.7), we see that for 
the white-noise ULA case, the optimum matched filter can be implemented 
with an FFT. This is certainly an important benefit of the ULA since the FFT 
greatly facilitates real-time implementation.
The corresponding optimum SNR is obtained by substituting the opti-
mum weight solution into (2.19), and is given by
	
SNRopt =

s2 w

2
s2k2 s

(2.22)
which is independent of the constant κ. The gain in output SNR achieved by 
the optimum beamformer is the ratio of output to input SNR
	
SNRgain =
SNRopt
SNRin
=
s
2
s2
sn

s2

(2.23)
where SNRin is the single channel SNR (assumed to be equal for all chan-
nels, n = 1, … , N). Note that the expression is independent of σ 2, since the 

	
Adaptive Array Processing
23
gain in SNR is a relative measure and is based on the white-noise assumption 
(not its strength).
In our previous ULA example, N = 16, s and sn are given by (2.3), and 
yield
	
sn
2 = e
j2p(n −1)d
lsinq0

= 1
and
s
2 = s¢s = 16
	
(2.24)
which corresponds to SNRgain = 16 = N (or, in decibels, 10 log 16 = 12.04 dB). 
Thus, in general, for an N-element ULA, the white-noise coherent integration 
gain of a matched filter is given by
	
SNRgain_dB = 10 log N (dB)	
(2.25)
If a taper or window function is employed [1], there is a loss in SNR since 
the weight vector w is no longer perfectly matched to the signal s of interest. 
It is straightforward to calculate this loss in SNR as follows. First, define the 
taper efficiency ratio, η eff, as the ratio of the tapered output SNR (SNRtap) to 
optimal SNR (SNRopt); that is,
	
heff =
SNRtap
SNRopt
= w¢s
2
N
	
(2.26)
where (2.24) was invoked. For the tapered case, w = s ○ t, where to insure the 
unity gain constraint w′w = 1, t must satisfy
	
w¢w = (s  t)¢(s  t)
= (s∗  s)¢(t∗  t)
= [1 … 1](t∗  t)
= t¢t
= t 2
2 = 1
	
(2.27)

24	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
where ‖t‖2 denotes the usual Euclidean (L2-norm) vector norm ‖t‖2 = t¢t  [2]. 
Substituting w = s ○ t into (2.26) yields
	
heff = (s  t)¢s

N
= (s∗  s)¢t
2
N

(2.28)
where ‖t‖1 denotes the L1-norm (sum of the absolute values of t [2]—recall that 
[1  …  1]t is the summation operator, which for a positive taper is also the 
L1-norm). Note that an elementary property of Hadamard products was also 
invoked, namely, s′(s ○ t) = (s∗ ○ s)′t (which is readily verified by an element-
wise comparison of both sides of the equality [8]).
For the 16-element 40-dB Chebyshev taper shown in Figure 2.3(a), ‖t‖1 = 
3.5, which when substituted into (2.28) yields η eff = 0.7642 (−1.17 dB). Note 
that for the uniform taper case (i.e., no taper), ‖t‖1 = 
N  (recall normaliza-
tion constraint) which yields, as expected, η eff = 1 (0 dB). It is interesting that 
for the uniform case, ‖t‖1 = ‖t‖2.
2.2.3  Case II: Additive Colored Noise
In general the additive noise term, n, consists of both white noise and colored 
noise (has correlation and/or spatial structure) due to the presence of structured 
interference sources such as clutter and jamming [7]. Thus, in general the total 
noise (interference plus white noise) covariance matrix R will not typically be 
diagonal, but will have a more complex structure. However, assuming only 
that R is positive-definite, a property guaranteed in practice since receiver noise 
is always present [7], a closed form solution for the optimum beamformer can 
still be obtained. Again, our objective is to maximize the SINR:
	
max
{w}
w¢s
2
w¢Rw
subject to: w¢w = 1
	
(2.29)

	
Adaptive Array Processing
25
Noting that R1/2R–1/2 = I, and again applying Schwarz’s inequality, we 
have the following inequality:
	
w¢s
2
w¢Rw = w¢R1/2R−1/2s
2
w¢Rw
≤(w¢Rw)(s¢R−1s)
w¢Rw
= s¢R−1s
	
(2.30)
or more simply
	
w¢R1/2R−1/2s
2
w¢Rw
≤s¢R−1s 	
(2.31)
Equality is achieved when R1/2w = κR–1/2s (colinearity requirement), 
or equivalently,
	
w = κR–1s	
(2.32)
where the Hermitian property (complex conjugate transpose symmetry [2]) 
of R has been invoked. Note that since the upper bound in (2.31) is indepen-
dent of w, (2.32) is strictly optimum, and achieves the upper bound; that is,
	
SINRopt = s′R–1s	
(2.33)
which reduces to (2.22) for the white-noise case (R = σ  2I).
Since R is of the form
	
R = RI + σ  2I	
(2.34)
where RI is a generally positive-semidefinite covariance matrix [7] associated 
with the colored-noise source (i.e., clutter and/or jamming) that is uncorrelated 
with the white noise, SINRopt is bounded by the white-noise SNRopt result 
(2.22) (i.e., thermal noise limited performance).
To illustrate the colored-noise case, consider the effect that a persistent 
interfering point source (i.e., a jammer) has on our example ULA considered 
earlier. For this case,
	
n = nJ + nRx

where nJ ∈ ℂN and nRx ∈ ℂN are the jammer and receiver noise vector RV 
signals, respectively [4]. The simplest model for a jammer (or strong cochannel 
interferer) is nJ = γ̃ sJ, where γ̃ is a zero-mean, complex scalar RV, assumed to 
be uncorrelated with the receiver noise (i.e., E{nJn′Rx} = ∅), with a variance 
(jammer power)

at the receiver input (per element), and sJ is the jammer steering vector asso-
ciated with a plane wave AoA of θ J [see (2.3)] [4]. Therefore, for the single 
jammer case,
	
R = E{nn¢}

(2.37)
Note that the matrix σ2
JsJs′J is rank one and is thus singular (but positive-
semidefinite since σ 2
J > 0). In general, if there are NJ uncorrelated jammers, 
R has the form [4]

As an example, consider the effect of six uncorrelated jammers imping-
ing on the aforementioned 16-element ULA, shown in Figure 2.4. Assuming 
each interferer produces an element jammer-to-noise ratio (JNR) of 50 dB (i.e., 
10 log10(σ 2
J/σ 2) = 50, for j = 1,  …  , NJ), and that the single element SNR 
is 0 dB (or equivalently, s′s = 16), the resulting quiescent beamformer output 
SINRq with θ 0 = 0° (i.e., s = [1  1  …  1]T) is

= 6.3 ×10−4(−32 dB)
	
(2.40)
This implies that any signal of interest at θ 0 = 0° would be 32 dB lower than 
the output response due to interference—a generally intolerable condition. If, 
on the other hand, we implement optimum beamforming, there is a dramatic 
improvement. Specifically,
	
SINRopt = s′R–1s	
(2.41)
	
= 15.7	
or 12.0 dB, a loss of only ~ 0.1 dB relative to the white-noise case. Even this 
simple example highlights the significant potential of optimum beam-forming. 
Of course, if even one of the jammers had an AoA of θ 0 = 0°, the optimum 
beamformer would be unable to null out the jammer and maximize the signal

response simultaneously. There would thus be no net gain in SINR relative 
to that jammer.
Figure 2.5 shows the corresponding optimum antenna response for the 
six-jammer case. Note that nulls or notches have been introduced into the pat-
tern at precisely the angles the jammers are present. Additionally, the pattern 
still has a distinct and well-formed main lobe to insure maximum response 
to desired signals at boresight.
As mentioned previously, it is possible to combine aperture tapering (e.g., 
Chebyshev windowing) with optimum beamforming by including in (2.32) 
the desired aperture taper t as follows
	
w = κR–1(s ○ t)	
(2.42)
Figure 2.6 illustrates an example of (2.42) and corresponds to the opti-
mum pattern of Figure 2.5 modified by the presence of a 30-dB Chebyshev 
taper. Of course, as previously discussed, the inclusion of a taper mismatch 
introduces additional SINR loss (in this case resulting output SINR is 11.3 dB, 
a loss of 0.7 dB relative to the optimum case). However, in practice, the practi-
cal benefits of maintaining low sidelobes is often well worth the modest loss.

An important fundamental question is, how many jammers can be 
nulled with an N-element array? If we let sJi denote the steering vector associ-
ated with the ith jammer, then a null is achieved if s Ji¢ w = 0.  To insure that 
a target of interest is not inadvertently nulled, we need to also invoke a so-
called mainbeam constraint of the form s′w = 1 (sometimes referred to as a 
unity gain constraint). Assuming that there are NJ linearly independent jam-
mer steering vectors (independent of s as well), the following linear system of 
equations results:
	
s¢w = 1
s J1¢ w = 0

which is a linear system of NJ + 1 equations in N unknowns. From elemen-
tary linear algebra [3], we know that there exists a w (not necessarily unique) 
that satisfies the above set of equations provided that NJ + 1 ≤ N. This, in 
turn, immediately implies that the number of jammers that can be nulled is 
bounded by
	
NJ ≤ N − 1	
(2.44)
The above optimum beamformer calculations were highly idealized as 
they assumed exact knowledge of the total interference covariance matrix, as 
well as perfectly matched channels and idealized jammer characteristics—con-
ditions not met in practice. Much of this book is devoted to strategies designed 
to preserve these desirable gains in more realistic operating environments. 
We next turn our attention to the other significant measurement dimension, 
namely time. More specifically, we will consider pulse-to-pulse time processing 
manifested as Doppler filtering, which plays a fundamental role in MTI radar.
2.3	 Optimum Temporal (Doppler/Pulse) Processing
Besides AoA, another key physical observable for separating moving targets 
from noise is Doppler frequency [5, 9, 10]. Fortunately, the mathematical 
framework employed in modern Doppler radar systems is essentially identical 
to that already introduced in our discussion of the ULA; specifically, a spatial 
point target produces a linear phase progression across a ULA. We will see 
that a Doppler-shifted point target similarly produces a linear phase progres-
sion in time and can thus be processed in a manner directly analogous to the 
beamformer case.
Consider the effect of a Doppler-shifted return propagating through a 
single channel, M-tap delay-line filter as shown in Figure 2.7. For a pulsed 
Doppler radar [5], the delay T is chosen to match the PRI. The output of the 
mth tap is then given by sm = e j2p(m−1) fd ,  m = 1, … , M, where fd  is the 
normalized Doppler frequency given by [5]

where PRF is the pulse repetition frequency (PRF = 1/PRI = 1/T), fd is the 
Doppler frequency of the point target in units of 1/time (e.g., hertz), vtgt and 
vRx are the target and receiver velocity vectors (Cartesian coordinates), ˆiRx  
is a unit direction vector pointing from the receiver to the target ˆiRx = 1
(
),  
λ is the operating wavelength, and ⋅ denotes the vector ‘‘dot’’ product; that 
is, a ⋅ b = ⎪a⎪⎪b⎪ cos θ, where θ is the angle between a and b. Note for a 
fixed PRF, the unambiguous Doppler region for complex sampling based on 
the Nyquist criterion is from −PRF/2 to +PRF/2 [5]. Thus, the unambiguous 
normalized Doppler region is
	
−0.5 ≤fd ≤+0.5	
(2.46)
Note that (2.45) is only valid (in general) for the monostatic case (transmitter 
and receiver collocated).
As with the optimum ULA beamformer, an optimized Doppler filter 
response can also be constructed by a judicious selection of the complex 
weighting factors wm, m = 1, … , M, in Figure 2.7. Let

denote the M-tap Doppler steering vector for a signal (Doppler) of interest and 
w = [w1  w2  …  wM]T denote the vector of weights. Then, as with the ULA 
case, we desire to choose w to maximize SINR. Since the math is identical, 
the optimum SINR solution is also given by (2.32); namely,
	
w = κR–1s	
(2.48)
where R is the M × M total noise covariance matrix, and κ is a scalar constant 
that does not affect SINR.
We will defer examples and rationale of optimum Doppler processing 
until Chapter 3, where ground clutter will be discussed. In this context, we 
will also introduce the notion of 2-D angle-Doppler (or space-time) process-
ing. Next, the notion of adaptive, vice-optimum processing is discussed for 
the previously introduced 1-D beamformer.
2.4	 Adaptive 1-D Processing
Unfortunately, in much of the radar and signal processing literature the expres-
sion for the optimum linear combiner (beamformer) is referred to as an adaptive 
linear combiner (or adaptive beamformer, and so forth). This equivalence is not 
only potentially misleading and confusing, it is in general incorrect—and this 
is not just pedantry. In real-world systems, adaptivity is used to adjust radar 
processing on the fly. The reasons for this are obvious. In the case of jamming, 
for example, one cannot know a priori both the strength and exact angular 
location. Similar arguments are true for airborne radar clutter.
This lack of prior information implies that the essential total interfer-
ence covariance matrix R of (2.32) must be estimated concurrently with the 
beamforming operation. To accomplish this, some form of sample estimate, 
derived from actual radar measurements, must be either explicitly or implicitly 
formed. Referred to somewhat generically as training (the term can be traced 
to Bernard Widrow’s pioneering work on adaptive neural networks [11]), it is 
precisely this adaptation process that is a major impetus for this book, many 
of the techniques described herein, and much of the research literature [12].

	
Adaptive Array Processing
33
Historically, adaptation to interference was accomplished by the explicit 
or implicit estimation of the local noise statistics. Beginning with cell averaging 
constant false-alarm rate (CACFAR) techniques, developed concurrently with 
the very first airborne MTI radars [13], adaptation has been accomplished by 
identifying a subset of the radar measurements from which noise statistics are 
estimated. Figure 2.8 presents a pictorial representation of this process. Let xi 
denote the N-dimensional output vector of a ULA corresponding to the ith 
range bin. To process xi according to (2.32), that is, to look for a target in a 
given direction, s, while simultaneously minimizing the influence of all other 
interfering signals, the covariance matrix for that ith range bin Ri is required.
A reasonable approach is to compute a sample estimate of Ri (which we 
will denote as ˆRi ) using surrounding range bins (without the cell under test 
to prevent so-called self-nulling) that are likely to contain similar interfer-
ence; that is,
	
ˆRi = 1
L
xlx l¢
l ∈Ωi∑
	
(2.49)
where L is the total number of samples used in the summation, and Ωi denotes 
the set of training samples used for the ith range bin. It is easy to show that if 
the data samples {xl}, l = 1, … , L, are uncorrelated and have identical covari-
ance R, (2.49) is an unbiased estimate of R, since

If, additionally, {xl}, l = 1, … , L, are Gaussian and independent identically dis-
tributed (i.i.d.), than (2.49) corresponds to the maximum likelihood estimate 
of Ri [7] as shown in Appendix 2B.
Of course in practice, there is no guarantee that the interference in the 
ith range bin will have statistics identical with the training data. Nonetheless, 
it is a reasonable first choice assuming that only range bins from surrounding, 
and thus hopefully similar, regions are utilized. Another practical constraint on 
the training data selection process is the presence of a buffer region around the 
cell under test comprised of so-called guard cells, as shown in Figure 2.8. This 
is sometimes included to prevent so-called self-nulling, since a target response 
may straddle more than one range bin or have temporal sidelobes present in 
other range bins, a common problem in pulse compression radars [14].
It is important to realize that if (2.49) is used in (2.32), then a minimum 
of N i.i.d. samples are required to insure that ˆRi  is nonsingular (almost surely 
[6]). However, under certain circumstances, as we will see later in this and 
subsequent chapters, very useful adaptive solutions can be obtained with sig-
nificantly fewer than N samples. This can be a very desirable practical feature 
since, in the case of clutter, statistics can vary significantly with range, thereby 
invalidating the necessary stationarity assumption tacitly employed in (2.49).
Reed, Mallet, and Brennan (RMB) [15], in a seminal paper, were able 
to rigorously characterize the impact of replacing the actual covariance, Ri, 
with its sample estimate, ˆRi,  under certain conditions. Specifically, if the L 
training samples Ωi = {xl}i are free of target signal contamination and are 
independent i.i.d. Gaussian vector RVs with statistics identical to the ith test 
cell (not included in the training data), then the following are true: (1) the 
elements of ˆRi  are complex Wishart-distributed [15], and (2) a closed form 
expression for the ratio ρ of the expected SINR using (2.49) to optimum 
SINR using (2.33) is given by [15]

(2.51)
This is the important RMB result, which states that the SMI method produces 
an SINR loss that is ~3dB if L ~ 2N. Note that (2.51) is also extremely use-
ful for estimating the amount of loss due to finite L. Referred to colloquially 
as RMB loss, this equation has become an integral part of a radar systems 
engineer’s SINR budget spreadsheets. As expected, ρ → 1 as L → ∞. An 
elegant and accessible derivation of this result can be found in the chapter by 
Steinhardt in [16].
Although 2N i.i.d. Gaussian samples yield an SINR that is within ~3 
dB of optimum, the corresponding adapted pattern may not be suitable for 
most situations due to pattern distortions. For example, Figure 2.9 displays the 
adapted pattern based on 2N samples for the N = 16 element ULA example 
of Figure 2.6, along with the optimum tapered pattern. Note the presence of 
extremely high sidelobes and shape-distortion of the main lobe. Although the

Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
adapted SMI pattern can be improved by increasing L (note the response in 
Figure 2.9 corresponding to 5N samples), there are many practical limits to 
doing so due to interference nonstationarity and/ or computational burden. 
Instead, it is worth examining the cause of the adapted pattern distortion at 
this stage by conducting an eigen analysis of the underlying adaptation process. 
In so doing, we will also lay the groundwork for an important class of robust 
adaptive signal-processing techniques based on optimum subspace estimation 
and principal components [17, 18].
We begin by first considering an eigendecomposition of a general Her-
mitian, positive-definite, N-dimensional covariance matrix R; that is,
	
R = UΛU ¢ =

(2.52)
where

Λ = diag{λ 1  λ 2  …  λ N} ∈ ℝ+

(2.54)
is the N × N diagonal matrix of corresponding strictly positive eigenvalues [8].

where
	
κ̃ = κ/λ min  and  Λ̃ = (1/λ min)Λ	
(2.57)
and λ min denotes the minimum eigenvalue of R. Thus,
	
Λ̃ = diag{λ̃ 1  λ̃ 2  …  λ̃ N}	
(2.58)
where λ̃ n = λ n /λ min is the nth normalized eigenvalue.
Finally, expressing (2.56) as a summation yields a very useful equivalent 
representation of the optimum beamformer result expressed in eigen form, 
namely,

Equation (2.59) shows that the optimum beamformer weight vector 
is formed by subtracting a weighted sum of the interference eigenvectors 
from the quiescent steering vector s. Note that only the eigenvectors with 
corresponding eigenvalues greater than λ min may contribute to the sum. 
The exact amount they contribute is proportional to the difference between 
their eigenvalues and the minimum eigenvalue term, as well as the amount 
of colinearity [i.e., (u′ns)].
To explain the distorted pattern results of Figure 2.9, consider first the 
eigendecomposition of the exact covariance for the six-jammer, 16-element 
ULA example. Figure 2.10 shows the eigenvalue distribution; there are exactly 
six large eigenvalues (due to the jammers). The remaining 10 eigenvalues are 
often referred to as the noise-floor components. To see why this is so, consider 
the structure of the exact covariance described by (2.38); that is,
	
R =

For the current example NJ = 6. Thus, the eigendecomposition of RJ is of the 
form
	
RJ = UJΛJU′J	
(2.62)
	
= UJ diag{λ J1  λ J2  …  λ J6  0  …  0}U′J
where there are six nonzero eigenvalues (the rank of RJ is exactly six since the 
jammers are linearly independent). Although the remaining 10 eigenvalues 
are zero, we can still use the Gram-Schmidt method to construct a complete 
16-dimensional orthogonal basis. Thus, we can assume that UJ is full rank 
and, therefore, that U–1
J = U′J.
Since any unitary matrix diagonalizes a diagonal matrix [8], the eigen-
decomposition of the total covariance matrix, R, is given by
	
R = U Λ U′ = UJ Λ U′J	
(2.63)
Figure 2.10  Comparison of exact and estimated eigenvalues for the six-jammer

The eigenvalues of R are thus given by

(2.64)
From (2.64) we see that λ min = σ 2 and that only the first six eigenvalues are 
greater than σ min. Thus, there are only six terms that contribute to the sum 
in (2.59) for the ideal case (known-covariance).
Now consider the eigenvalues of the estimated covariance ˆR,  shown in 
Figure 2.10, for an example in which L = 2N i.i.d. Gaussian samples are used 
in (2.49). Note that while there are certainly six large distinct eigenvalues, 
there is no definitive noise floor. More specifically, since the first 15 estimated 
eigenvalues { ˆl1, … , ˆl15}  are greater than the minimum eigenvalue ˆl16,  they 
may all contribute in (2.59). Unfortunately, except for the very strong jammer 
eigenvalues, the eigenvalues/vector pairs associated with the noise floor are 
not well estimated with only 2N samples. The biggest impact, as illustrated in 
Figure 2.9, is significant corruption of the adapted pattern sidelobes.
Although we will defer an in-depth discussion of principal components 
methods until Chapter 4, it is clear from the above discussion that if we only 
used the six dominant eigenvalues/vector pairs in (2.59) and set ˆlmin  = σ 2 
(since the receiver noise floor is reasonably well-known in a calibrated radar), 
we should have a much better pattern. Indeed, as shown in Figure 2.11, the 
adapted pattern using only the six principal components in (2.59) is extremely 
close to the optimum. The corresponding SINR loss relative to the optimum 
tapered response is only 0.8 dB (for L = 2N).
Figure 2.11 also displays the adapted pattern obtained by adding a diago-
nal loading term [19] to ˆR;  that is,
	
ˆRDL = ˆR + d2I 	
(2.65)
where δ 2 = 10σ 2 was chosen (i.e., 10 dB of diagonal loading). Again the 
adapted pattern is quite good compared with SMI. The reason diagonal loading 

40	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
works somewhat similarly to the principal components method is clear from 
an examination of the eigenvalues of ˆRDL,  which are
	
ˆΛDL = diag ˆl1 + d2 ˆl2 + d2… ˆl16 + d2
{
} 	
(2.66)
Since, in the example considered, ˆln << d2,  for n = 7, … , 16, we again 
see that the 10 smallest eigenvalues/vectors will not appreciably contribute to 
the sum of (2.59). However, the depth of the nulls is not the same for diago-
nal loading as it is for principal components because the weighting factors in 
(2.59) have been decreased (uniformly). This resulting decrease in null depth, 
which can be an issue in some applications, highlights some of the limitations 
of diagonal loading (not to mention the issue of choosing a correct value of 
loading factor [20]). Note also that the corresponding SINR loss relative to 
the optimum tapered response is slightly worse (0.9 dB) than that for principal 
components, but is still quite good compared to SMI.

that the principal components pattern is virtually identical to the optimum pattern.

2.5	 Adaptivity in Nonstationary Environments
The availability of a sufficiently large training set of i.i.d. samples is highly 
suspect in stressing applications involving large numbers of adaptive DoFs. 
Variability in clutter terrain and other interference nonstationarities place 
practical limits on the size and quality of the training data available [19]. Thus, 
an extremely important issue is how many adaptive DoFs can be utilized or 
supported in a given interference environment.
The answer, as we have already seen, is highly dependent on the spe-
cific adaptation algorithm employed. For example, in the principal compo-
nents method, we saw that instead of supporting 16 adaptive DoFs, we only 
needed to estimate the subspace associated with the interference, which was 
six-dimensional. Of course, we somehow needed to know that only six eigen-
values were required. For this example, a reasonably simple criterion could be 
used based on the size of the estimated eigenvalue relative to the known noise 
floor. When clutter interference is introduced in the next chapter, we will see 
that there is often a continuum of eigenvalues with monotonic decreasing 
amplitudes down to the noise floor, thus complicating the determination of 
a simple threshold approach. Nonetheless, by a judicious incorporation of 
prior structural information, an order of magnitude or greater reduction in 
sample support requirements can be achieved while preserving near optimal 
performance.
While minimizing sample support requirements is an indirect way of 
addressing nonstationarity, there are other methods that attempt to directly 
model or parameterize the nonstationarity. Examples of this approach include 
the so-called time varying weights technique [21], which has been proposed for 
both bistatic and circular array STAP applications, and CMT, which models 
the subdominant rank inflation mechanisms that give rise to nonstationarity 
in interference rank [22].
Although we will discuss CMTs at much greater length in the context 
of clutter cancellation and STAP in Chapters 4 and 5, they have also proved 
straightforward to apply in spatial-only adaptivity for the so-called stale weights 
problem [23–27]—a form of nonstationarity. For a multitude of practical rea-
sons, the adaptive weight vector derived from the necessarily finite training 
set (secondary data) may need to be applied to data outside of that training 
region [24]. If a jammer is present, it may be at a slightly different angle if the 
training data is old relative to the dynamics of the jammer [24]. Although 
derivative constraints have been proposed to remedy this [24] by producing 
wider jammer nulls, a much simpler and more straightforward approach that 

42	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
essentially produces the same effect (that is, readily extensible to nonlinear 
arrays) is via the application of a CMT to the sample covariance matrix (also 
referred to as covariance augmentation in [28]); that is,
	
ˆR →ˆR  T 	
(2.67)
where ˆR  is the sample covariance matrix (which may also include diagonal 
loading [23]), ○ denotes the Hadamard matrix multiplication operator (sim-
ply conformal elementwise multiplication analogous to matrix addition and 
subtraction [2]), and T ∈ ℂN×N is a CMT matrix [23]. Mailloux [26] and 
Zatman [27] independently showed that by setting T equal to a correlation 
matrix of the form [23]
	
[T]i,j = sinc (Δ⎪i − j⎪/π)	
(2.68)
where sinc (x) ≜ sin (πx)/πx, [T]i,j denotes the (i, j)th element of T, and Δ is a 
positive scalar used to set the amount of notch widening (dimensions of radians 
[23]) and can also be interpreted as the amount of uniform random dither [23] 
or bandwidth [26]. The specific CMT of (2.68) is referred to as a Mailloux-
Zatman CMT in [23]. Figure 2.12 shows an example of the application of a 
Mailloux-Zatman CMT; the jammer notch widening is quite readily appar-
ent, as are the preservation of the main lobe and average sidelobe levels [23].
We will defer a detailed taxonomical discussion of general methods 
for addressing other forms of nonstationarity that arise in space-time clutter 
cancellation, including additional techniques for minimizing sample support

In this chapter we began our journey into STAP with a sojourn into its ori-
gins in 1-D adaptive beamforming and Doppler processing. After deriving 
the equations for optimal beamforming and illustrating its application to a 
multijammer scenario, we introduced the concept of adaptive beamforming. 
An important distinction was drawn between optimal and adaptive beam-
forming, and some fundamental differences were highlighted, particularly for 
the finite sample covariance estimation case. For this case, an eigen analysis 
was conducted to gain key insights into the origins of the degradation from 
optimality for the finite sample case. In particular, the occurrence of erratic 
adapted sidelobes and main lobe distortion were shown to be the result of

estimation errors associated with the so-called noise-floor eigenvalues/vec-
tors. Both principal components and diagonal loading were introduced to 
remedy this problem.
Finally, a brief discussion of issues arising when applying adaptive pro-
cessing in nonstationary environments was introduced, along with an outline 
of strategies that can be brought to bear, including minimal sample support 
methods (indirect approach) and nonstationary modeling (direct approach). 
Figure 2.12  Example of the application of a CMT to produce a wider jammer null 
to help address the stale weights problem. Adapted patterns for a 16-element half-
wavelength ULA in the presence of a 60-dB per element JNR at a normalized angle 
of −0.25 (−30° off boresight): (a) optimum adapted pattern derived from exact (ideal) 
covariance with a −35-dB sidelobe level Chebyshev taper, (b) pattern obtained with 
a 2N sample covariance matrix (i.e., SMI method), (c) pattern obtained if 10 dB of 
diagonal loading is added to the sample covariance matrix, and (d) pattern obtained 
if a diagonally loaded (10 dB) Mailloux-Zatman CMT is employed with a ∆ = 0.01. Note 
the preservation of good sidelobes associated with diagonal loading as well as a 
substantially widened (and more robust) jammer null.

The concept of CMT covariance augmentation was also introduced to simply 
address the so-called stale weights problem. A detailed survey of these methods 
will be presented in Chapter 5.
Problems
1.	 Consider a nonuniform linear array (NULA) with N identical ele-
ments with interelement spacing from right to left of d1, d2, … , dN–1, 
where dn > 0, ∀n (see Figure 2.1).
a.	 Derive an expression for the steering vector for a signal emanating 
from θ 0 analogous to (2.3). Is the resulting phase always linear?
b.	 Derive an expression for the beamformer output response from 
−90° to +90° when the array is steered to θ 0.
c.	 Assume d1 = λ/2 and dn = 2dn–1, n = 2:N − 1, where N = 16. 
Numerically evaluate the beamformer response from −90° to +90° 
when steered to boresight θ 0 = 0. How do the sidelobes compare 
to the ULA response with uniform half wavelength spacing? How 
does the mainlobe compare?
2.	 An alternative to the maximum SINR beamformer derivation of 
Chapter 2 is the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) 
beamformer (see [4]). The goal is to minimize the total output power 
out of the adaptive beamformer subject to a distortionless constraint 
on a desired signal of interest. Specifically, find an optimum set of 
weights w such that
min
w var w¢x
(
)  subject to: w¢s = 1
where w, x, s are as already defined in Chapter 2 for the additive 
colored noise case.
a.	 Find the optimum weight vector w. (HINT: Use Lagrange multi-
pliers for the constraint and recognize that the resulting objective 
function is convex and quadratic.)
b.	 How does your solution compare with (2.32)?
c.	 Use the optimum weight vector you derived to calculate the result-
ing output SINR and compare with (2.33). What observations 
can you make?
3.	 If the optimum beamformer has distortionless constraints on L < N 
linearly independent rank 1 steering vectors (say, L distinct unam-
biguous angles), how many jammer nulls can the beamformer create?

4.	 For the single jammer case, show that the dominant eigenvector u1 
in (2.59) is equal to the normalized rank-1 jammer steering vector sJ 
for all feasible sJ.
5.	 For the two-jammer case, show that (in general) u1 ≠ sJ1 and u2 ≠ sJ2 
(normalized jammer steering vectors assumed). Under what condi-
tions is the equality satisfied?

Appendix 2B: Derivation of the Maximum Likelihood Sample 
Covariance Matrix
The derivation in this appendix of the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) 
of the sample covariance matrix follows that of Steinhardt [16] and Pillai [30]. 
The reader is encouraged to consult [16, 30] for further statistical details and 
properties of the adaptive beamformer including an elegant derivation of the 
important RMB result of (2.51) in [16].

Note also that additive terms not involving R were dropped in (2B.7) since 
they do not affect the result.
Since there is a one-to-one mapping between R and Ψ [i.e., (2B.8)] and 
both are positive-definite Hermitian matrices, we can first minimize with 
respect to Ψ, then solve for R to obtain the final result. This process is further

Space-Time Adaptive Processing
3.1	 Introduction
The term STAP was first applied to multidimensional adaptive filtering of 
clutter and jamming in airborne MTI radars [1, 2]. Unlike ground-based (or 
ground-stationary) MTI radars, clutter returns manifest themselves as fully 
2-D (nonfactorable) structures due to the motion-induced Doppler-spreading 
effect described in Section 3.2. As a consequence, the traditional factored, 
or decoupled, approaches of beamforming followed by Doppler filtering (or 
vice versa) are not optimal [1]. Instead, as we will see, a better approach is to 
perform multidimensional filtering that accounts for angle-Doppler coupling.
As we will shortly see, space-time clutter is generally colored noise, that 
is, a nondiagonal covariance matrix. This is a good news/bad news situation: 
On the one hand, the fact that it has structure suggests that there may be an 
opportunity for separating the clutter subspace from the signal subspace via 
space-time filtering—as described later. On the other hand, this can only be 
accomplished if we have an accurate model for the clutter structure—therein 
lies the rub.
The requisite accuracy of this model is, of course, highly dependent on 
the particular application. For example, in a high PRF (Doppler unambiguous 
[3]) airborne MTI (AMTI) radar with good two-way antenna sidelobes, the 
targets of interest will be well removed (in Doppler) from the strongest main 

54	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
lobe clutter interference [3]. This situation only requires a sidelobe notch that 
is well removed in angle-Doppler from the target main lobe. Since widening 
and deepening this notch width (e.g., with CMTs [4] or power selected train-
ing (PST) [5]) will have virtually no effect on the target main lobe response, 
the clutter model need not be very complex.
On the other hand—in stark contrast to the AMTI case—ground MTI 
(GMTI) radars can often encounter slow targets that are very close (in angle-
Doppler) to mainbeam clutter. In this case, a much higher-fidelity clutter 
model and multidimensional filtering scheme are required [6]. Since ground 
clutter can be exquisitely complex—comprised of all sorts of terrain, surface 
reflectivities, and internal motion—this modeling problem can be extremely 
challenging [6]. To make matters worse, this model must be implementable in 
real time. Indeed, much of the current STAP research is aimed at ever more 
refined and robust modeling (explicit or implicit) of ground clutter for just 
such applications [6–11].
In this chapter, we introduce a basic model of clutter combining both 
basic Doppler physics and stochastic modeling. This first-order 2-D clutter 
model will be useful for establishing basic performance characteristics and 
properties of both optimum and adaptive STAP filtering algorithms. While 
adequate for some nonstressing applications, many necessary real-world refine-
ments to this model will be described in Chapter 4. Only then will a compre-
hensive survey of many current STAP techniques be introduced and applied 
to higher-fidelity simulations.
3.2	 Need for Joint Space and Time Processing
When a radar emits a pulse, it propagates outward at the speed of light with 
a directional intensity distribution governed by the transmit antenna pattern 
[12]. In addition to potentially illuminating a target of interest, everything else 
in the radar’s field of regard will likewise be radiated. Of particular concern 
are the reflections from ground clutter whose aggregate return can be many 
orders of magnitude greater than a potential target of interest.
In addition to angle and range separation, for MTI radars, the Doppler 
shift induced by a moving target is pivotal in separating it from ground clutter 
(which is assumed to be stationary [3]). For a nonmoving radar (e.g., a fixed 
ground-based or statically deployed airborne system such as an aerostat [13]), 
ground-clutter returns should not have appreciable Doppler shifts and can 
thus be eliminated by notching out the zero-Doppler filter [3]. Unfortunately, 

	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing

this straightforward 1-D processing strategy is insufficient when the radar is 
moving—such as in airborne or even spaceborne MTI systems [14].
To see why this is the case, consider Figure 3.1, which depicts the N-ele-
ment ULA radar of Chapter 2 in uniform motion. Neglecting for the moment 
any small elevation angle and curved Earth effects [1, 2], we see that ground 
clutter contained in an iso-range ring centered at the radar will have a Doppler-
shift distribution due to the motion of the radar. The width of the ring, which 
is governed by the bandwidth of the radar pulse, is approximately ∆R ~ c/(2B) 
[2], where c is the speed of light, and B is the pulse bandwidth (consistent units 
assumed). For the side-looking case illustrated in Figure 3.1, we see that the 
normalized Doppler shift induced on a differential clutter patch located at an 
angle θ relative to the array boresight is given by [1]
	
fd = 2vT
l sinq 	
(3.1)

velocity motion relative to the ground.

Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
where v is the speed of the radar in units consistent with λ and T. Note that 
(3.1) is consistent with (2.45) if we recognize that for the geometry of Figure 
3.1, vtgt = 0 (i.e., the clutter patch is stationary), vRx = vˆi y,  where ˆi y  is a unit 
vector in the y direction, and ˆi y ⋅ˆiRx  = −sin θ.
In addition to a spatially dependent Doppler shift, each clutter patch will 
have a spatially dependent reradiating intensity that depends on the transmit 
antenna pattern and the intrinsic reflectivity of the clutter [15]. In general, 
this pattern consists of both front lobe (main lobe and sidelobes) and back 
lobe radiation (see Figure 3.1). Most airborne MTI radars are designed to 
insure that the back lobe radiation is significantly attenuated and can often 
be ignored [16]. However, since this may not always be the case (especially at 
low frequencies), we will explicitly account for it in Chapter 4.
Figure 3.2 illustrates the impact of uniform radar motion. In the absence 
of platform motion (v = 0), the stationary clutter is concentrated along the 
zero-Doppler contour for all q. However, when v ≠ 0, there is a linear rela-
tionship between Doppler and sin θ (or q) governed by (3.1). As a result, the 
clutter energy is distributed along a line, or “clutter ridge,” as shown in Figure 
3.2. Note that for the case illustrated, the antenna is aligned with direction of 
motion. The effect of antenna crabbing (array misalignment with the ground-
referenced velocity vector) will be considered in Chapter 4.
The slope β of the clutter ridge is easily obtained by introducing the 
normalized angle, q = d
l  sin θ, in (3.1), which yields

(3.3)
Thus, the case illustrated in Figure 3.2 corresponds to β = 1. Figure 3.2 also 
clearly illustrates that a simple 1-D filtering scheme is not optimum for sepa-
rating target from clutter since competing clutter can potentially come from 
several possible directions (depending on β) [1], hence the need for joint space 
and time (i.e., 2-D) processing.

We are now in a position to quantify the total clutter return from a given 
iso-range ring. Assuming that the ith clutter patch at a normalized angle, qi,  
in the iso-range ring is far enough away so that elevation angle is negligible 
[1], its spatial N-dimensional steering vector ai is given by
	
ai = 1 e j2pqi e j2p(2)qi … e j2p(N-1)qi

(3.4)
Since this ith clutter patch also has a normalized Doppler shift fdi ,  each vec-
tor of array outputs (i.e., a “snapshot”) from successive pulses due to the ith 
clutter patch will have a temporal linear phase progression; that is, at the mth 
PRI, the clutter patch snapshot is given by
	
e
j2p(m−1) fdiai 	
(3.5)
If M pulses are to be processed in a CPI [1], the total N × M matrix of 
space-time steering vectors for the ith clutter patch is of the form

This corresponds to an observation vector consisting of a total of NM measure-
ments that can conveniently be represented by the Kronecker product [17] of 
the Doppler and spatial steering vectors, namely,

where vi is the NM-dimensional space-time steering vector for the ith clut-

Figure 3.3 displays a sample normalized angle-Doppler signal of the form 
(3.7); as was the case with the 1-D angle response, main lobe and sidelobe 
features are evident. The pattern in Figure 3.3 can be obtained via a 2-D FFT 
since both the spatial and temporal sampling are uniform [1].
The total space-time clutter return from a given iso-range is thus an 
NM-dimensional random vector Xc ∈ ℂNM of the form
	
Xc =
g ivi
i=1
Nc
∑
	
(3.10)
where γ̃i is a complex scalar RV that accounts for the amplitude and phase of 
the ith clutter patch, and Nc is the total number of clutter patches in the iso-
range ring. Note that (3.10) is essentially a Riemann sum approximation to 
the actual continuous clutter integral [1, 15]. However, due to the finite spatial 

	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing
59
and temporal resolution (or bandwidth) of the radar, this approximation is 
accurate provided that Nc and the corresponding clutter patches are chosen 
properly. For a radar-centric treatise of the validity of integral approximations 
like (3.10), the reader is referred to Brennan and Mallett [18].
In general, γ̃i will depend not only on the transmit antenna pattern, but 
also on the intrinsic nature of the clutter and can be quite complex in its scat-
tering mechanisms [15, 19–21]. Several of these complicating factors will be 
considered in later chapters (e.g., inhomogeneities, internal clutter motion). 
At present, we will assume that the underlying clutter is homogenous and can 
thus be modeled as a wide sense stationary (wss) process [22] with uncorrelated 
complex reflectivity factors; that is,
	
E{ g i g j
∗} = 0, ∀i, j:i ≠j 	
(3.11)
Moreover, the average (or expected) strength of the ith scatterer is 
assumed to be proportional to the transmit antenna gain [1]; that is,

The total space-time covariance matrix R ∈ ℂNM×NM, due to both clutter 
and receiver noise, is of the form
	
R = Rc + σ 2I	
(3.14)
where it is assumed that clutter is uncorrelated with receiver noise. The clut-
ter-to-noise ratio (CNR) [1] is defined as the ratio of the clutter power to the 
receiver noise power on a single element and a single pulse; that is,
	
CNR = Rc(1, 1)
s2
	
(3.15)
where the first diagonal element of Rc was arbitrarily chosen since each chan-
nel is assumed to have the same receiver noise level and elemental antenna 
pattern. Throughout this text, we will set the noise floor to 0 dB (σ 2 = 1) for 
notational and graphical convenience and, thus, adjust the clutter (and pos-
sibly jammer) level to achieve a specified CNR (and/or JNR).
We are now in a position to examine the space-time, or equivalently, 
the angle-Doppler structure of R. One method for characterizing the clutter 
is by examining the 2-D (angle-Doppler) power spectrum corresponding to 
R [2]. The so-called Fourier-based power spectral density (psd) is the 2-D posi-
tive function defined as [2]

(3.16)
where s( fd ,q)  is the NM-dimensional target steering vector specifying the 
normalized Doppler and angle of interest, and R is the total interference cova-
riance matrix. Equation (3.16) can be interpreted as the expected value of the 
2-D discrete Fourier transform of the total clutter plus noise signal out of the 
space-time beamformer [2, 23]; that is,

(3.17)
where x ∈ ℂNM is the received NM-dimensional total clutter-plus-noise vec-
tor RV. It is assumed in (3.16) that the receiver noise floor is set to 0 dB (i.e., 
σ 2 = 1) and that the steering vectors are normalized to unity (i.e., s′s = 1), 
which insures that PF ( fd , q) = 1 if only receiver noise is present. Later in this 
chapter, a much higher resolution estimate will be obtained that is far more 
representative of the information exploited by optimum space-time processors.
Figure 3.4 shows the psds for four different Doppler spreads (β = 0, 
0.5, 1, and 2) for a 16-element, 16-pulse example (i.e., N = M = 16) with a 
CNR set to 40 dB. Note the presence of Doppler aliasing when β > 1 [3]. In 
this case, for a given target Doppler of interest, competing sidelobe clutter 
can exist in multiple directions. In certain low Earth orbit (LEO) space-based 
radar (SBR) scenarios, Doppler aliasing can occur in the mainbeam due to 
the extremely high ground speeds (~ 7 km/sec) [16, 24], unless a very large 
antenna is employed.
It is apparent from Figures 3.2 and 3.4 that there can be a substantial 
reduction in the percentage of the unambiguous angle-Doppler observation 
space occupied by clutter when 2-D processing is employed. This colored-
noise subspace compression is best understood and quantified by conducting 
an eigen analysis of the total interference covariance matrix to determine the 
extent of the clutter subspace.
Figure 3.5 shows the eigenvalue distributions corresponding to the four 
different β values considered in Figure 3.4. Note the increase in the effec-
tive rank of the clutter portion of the total interference eigenspectrum with 
increasing β, where the effective rank is defined as

and Rc is the clutter-only covariance matrix. Equation (3.18) defines the effec-
tive rank as the number of eigenvalues that exceed the receiver noise floor 
[25]. This is often a more meaningful definition of rank for radar engineers 
since eigenvalues below the noise floor can be ignored (recall from Chapter 
2 that the eigencanceller form of the optimum weight vector only contains 
Figure 3.4  Power spectral densities (Fourier-based) for four different values of β: (a) β

contributions from eigenvectors whose corresponding eigenvalues are greater 
than λ min = σ 2 [25]).
A useful expression for estimating the rank (under ideal conditions) of 
the clutter-only covariance matrix, Rc, has been obtained by Brennan for the 
case of a side-looking ULA with fixed PRF, constant velocity, and no crab 
[1, 26]. Specifically
	
rank {Rc} ≈ N + (M − 1)β	
(3.19)
Equation (3.19) is an exact equality for integer values of β. Since the effective 
rank depends on CNR according to (3.18), in general rankeff{Rc} ≤ rank{Rc}, 
especially for weak clutter cases.
It is worth examining the origins of (3.19) as it sheds light on the issues 
associated with space-time clutter cancellation, as well as on an historically 
important space-time clutter-rejection scheme known as displaced phase center 
array (DPCA) processing [27]. To accomplish this, we recall from (3.13) that 
Rc is of the form

(3.22)
that is, an N × N diagonal matrix of the relative clutter patch strengths (includ-
ing transmit antenna pattern effects). Since Gi represents the average power 
from each clutter patch, we may assume that Gi > 0, ∀ i [if a particular Gi = 
0, simply remove its corresponding steering vector from the summation in 
(3.20)]. Thus, the rank{R} is given by
	
rank {Rc} = min (rank {[v1  v2  …  vNc]}, NM)	
(3.23)
	
= min (rank {V}, NM)
where it is assumed that N ≥ NM and vi ≠ ξvj for i ≠ j (where ξ is an arbitrary 
complex scalar). In other words, the rank of R is determined by the number 
of linearly independent space-time clutter steering vectors, vi, i = 1, … , N: N 
≥ NM, but may be less than NM (indeed, this is desirable).
For the conditions stated, and assuming that β is an integer, the ith 
clutter steering vector has a Vandermonde structure [1] of the form

Starting with the first N entries from the first PRI (first block), we see that 
only one element from the second PRI (second block) is distinct from the first 
N, namely wN
i. This trend continues for the third and subsequent pulses, with 
only one distinct new element being added for each new PRI. Thus, after M 
pulses, the total number of distinct elements is N + (M − 1), which agrees 
with (3.19) exactly for β = 1.
Since the rank of a matrix is unaffected by an interchange of rows, the

where Ξ is an [N + β(M − 1)] × Nc, matrix. Since the rank of a matrix is 
equal to the number of linearly independent rows or columns (which ever is 
smaller) [28], we see that
	
rank {V} = rank {Ξ} = min {N + β(M − 1), NM}	
(3.27)
since wi ≠ wj, for i ≠ j, which is the desired result.
It is particularly illuminating to examine the β = 1 case, which corre-
sponds to the situation when the antenna moves precisely one interelement 
spacing per PRI. If only the first N − 1 elements are used for reception on 
the first pulse, and only the last N − 1 elements are likewise used for the next 
(second) pulse, then the ground appears stationary to the antenna (assuming 
perfect channel match) [27]. This is the so-called DPCA case [27]. Clutter 
cancellation can then be “simply” accomplished by coherently subtracting the 
returns from successive pulses on adjacent antennas (i.e., the two-pulse MTI 
canceller [2]). Apart from the challenges of matching antenna channels and 
eliminating crab angle of the array relative to the true ground-track flight 
path, DPCA requires that the PRI (or PRF) be chosen in (3.3) to satisfy β 
= 1—an often demanding restriction in practice. DPCA will be studied in 
more detail in Chapter 5.

3.2.1  Joint Clutter and Jamming Characteristics
If clutter and jamming are both present, the total space-time interference 
covariance matrix has the form
	
R = Rc + RJ + σ 2I	
(3.28)
where it is assumed that the jamming is uncorrelated with clutter and receiver 
noise [22]. The single pulse, spatial-only jammer covariance matrix was derived 
in Chapter 2. Assuming that the jammer signal is uncorrelated from pulse-to-
pulse, the off-diagonal block terms (corresponding to temporal cross correla-
tion) are null matrices. Thus, the NM-dimensional jammer-only covariance, 
RJ, has the following block-diagonal form:
	
RJ =

(3.29)
where ∅ is used to indicate that the off-block-diagonal entries are zero. Since 
the rank of a block-diagonal matrix is equal to the sum of the ranks of the 
constituent blocks [28], we see that the rank of RJ is given by
	
rank{RJ } =

(3.30)
For example, if there are three uncorrelated noise jammers, and M = 
16, the rank of RJ is 3 × 16 = 48. If N = 16, the fraction of the total avail-
able observation space occupied by the jammers is 48 ÷ 256 = 3/16, which 
is precisely the same ratio if spatial-only processing is performed (NJ = 3, N 
= 16). In other words, there is no advantage to using space-time processing 
against conventional noise jammers—spatial-only processing will suffice. The

67
advantage of space-time processing is realized against clutter (although simul-
taneous jammer nulling is readily accommodated—as will be shown later).
Figure 3.6 displays a space-time eigenspectrum with and without jam-
ming. Note that the presence of jamming generally increases the effective rank 
of the combined clutter and jamming subspace.
3.3	 Optimum Space-Time Processing for MTI Radar
We next turn our attention to deriving the optimal space-time beamformer 
for rejecting both clutter and jamming. Consider the space-time linear beam-
former of Figure 3.7, consisting of N identical antenna elements (spatial DoFs) 
and M PRI time taps (temporal DoFs). Analogous to the 1-D beamformer of 
Figure 2.1, the output y is in general the linear superposition of the desired 
signal response ys and an undesired noise/interference response yn. Our objec-
tive will thus be to choose an optimal set of complex space-time weights, w, 
so as to maximize SINR.
By adopting the vector RV notation of Chapter 2, we have an optimiza-
tion problem identical to that already solved in Chapter 2. Specifically, the 
weight vector that maximizes SINR is given by
	
w = κR–1s	
(3.31)

where R ∈ ℂNM×NM is the NM × NM total interference (clutter and/or jam-
ming) plus receiver noise covariance matrix, κ is a scalar that does not affect 
the SINR, and s ∈ ℂNM is the NM-dimensional space-time (angle-Doppler) 
steering vector of the desired signal which is given by
	
s = b ⊗ a

where q0 and fd  denote the desired angle and Doppler, respectively, and the 
superscript T denotes transposition without conjugation. The corresponding 
optimal SINR is given by (see Chapter 2),

SINRopt = s′R–1s	
(3.35)
As with the 1-D optimal beamformer, tapering can be incorporated into 
(3.31) to reduce both angle and Doppler sidelobes at the expense of mainbeam 
broadening and additional SINR loss (see Section 2.2). For 2-D beamform-
ing, tapering is incorporated as follows:
	
w = κR–1(s ○ t)	
(3.36)
where
	
t = td ⊗ tθ	
(3.37)
td ∈ ℝ+
M is the M-dimensional Doppler taper, and tθ ∈ ℝ+
NM is the N-dimen-
sional angle taper (thus t ∈ ℝ+
NM is NM-dimensional as expected).
Figure 3.8 provides an example optimum space-time beam pattern (with 
and without tapering) for an N = M = 16 example, with look angle and 
Doppler given by q0 = 0  (side-looking case), fd = +0.25.  The β is set to 1, 
the CNR is 40 dB, and all JNRs are 50 dB (at the element level). Note the 
simultaneous presence of both clutter and jamming nulls. Since for a given 
radar pointing angle there may be a range of Doppler frequencies of interest, 
it is often convenient to plot SINR versus Doppler for a fixed angle. Figure 
3.9 shows an example of this for the side-looking case (θ 0 = 0°); the SINR 
dropout due to main lobe clutter is clearly evident.
It is evident from an examination of Figure 3.8 that the optimum space-
time beamformer is utilizing very high-resolution information regarding the 
interference, which is manifested as sharp nulls in the angle-Doppler patterns. 
Indeed, a very high-resolution (i.e., a so-called super-resolution [29]) spectral 
estimator underlies the beamformer and is given by
	
PMF
fd , q0
(
) =
1
s¢ fd , q0
(
)R−1s fd , q0
(
)
	
(3.38)
which is simply the reciprocal of the optimal SINR given by (3.35). Note that 
consistent with (3.16), it is assumed that σ 2 = 1 and s′s = 1, which insures 
that PMF
fd , q0
(
) = 1 = 1 when only receiver noise is present. Equation (3.38) 
is generally referred to as the minimum variance or Capon super-resolution 
spectral estimator [23, 29, 30] and can be interpreted as the expected value 
of the output power of the optimum colored-noise matched filter (optimum 
space-time beamformer), when a unity gain on signal constraint is invoked.

Space-Time Adaptive Processing
71
The reason (3.38) achieves a much higher resolution than the Fourier-
based estimator of (3.16) is that the weight vector minimizes leakage from all 
other angle-Doppler, while maintaining a mainbeam constraint [23]. To see 
this explicitly, consider the Capon estimator (weight vector), which satisfies 
the following optimization problem:
	
min: 
{w} E w¢x
2
(
) = w¢Rw 	
(3.39)
subject to: w′s = 1
Since R is assumed to be positive-definite, the objective function is a convex 
quadratic form subject to a linear equality constraint [31]. Thus, a necessary 
and sufficient condition for an extremum is that the first (vector) derivative 
of the following augmented objective function vanish:
	
d w¢Rw + m(1−w¢s)
(
)
d w
= 0 	
(3.40)
where μ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the unity gain constraint 
[31]. From the vector derivative identities [31]
	
dw¢Rw
d w
= 2Rw 	
(3.41)
and
	
dw¢s
dw = s 	
(3.42)
we have, upon substitution into (3.40), the following optimum Capon spec-
tral estimator:
	
w = κR–1s	
(3.43)
where to satisfy the unity gain constraint w′s = 1,
	
k =
1
s′R−1s 	
(3.44)

72	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
Note that (3.43) is the same expression as the max SINR beamformer. The 
only difference is the choice of normalization parameter. The beamformer 
output power corresponding to (3.43) is thus given by

Figure 3.10 contains a comparison of the Fourier-based [i.e., (3.16)] and 
Capon power-spectral density plots; the super-resolution properties of the 
space-time matched-filter-based method are clearly evident. Finer resolution 
is often very useful for better understanding the underlying properties of the 
interference, as well as the performance of optimum space-time beam-formers. 
This will be made evident in Chapter 4, when clutter subspace leakage phe-
nomena (e.g., internal clutter motion) are introduced.

3.4	 STAP
With Chapter 2 as background, it is clear that STAP is simply the practical 
attempt to implement optimum space-time processing [i.e., (3.31)]. Since, in 
practice, the interference environment is generally not known a priori, it is 
necessary to approximate the “exact” or “ideal” covariance required in (3.31) 
with a finite sample estimate. Again, this is assumed to be accomplished by 
the availability of a suitable training region in which the interference is pres-
ent (without any target-like signals)—as was the assumption in Chapter 2.
Unfortunately, the sample support requirements are much greater for 
STAP than for the relatively simple 1-D adaptive beamforming examples 
considered in Chapter 2. For example, from the RMB result [see (2.51)], we 
see that at least 2NM = 512 samples are required for the N = M = 16 case to 
insure that the resulting SINR is within about 3 dB of optimum, compared 
with only 32 samples for the N = 16 1-D case. Assuming that the interfer-
ence is stationary over hundreds of range bins is simply not realistic in many 
applications. Thus, from the very onset, we are faced with the inherent require-
ment to develop techniques that retain the benefits of 2-D filtering, but reduce 
sample support requirements. Whatever methods are considered must also be 
robust to other real-world effects (internal clutter motion, channel match, and 
so forth) described in Chapter 4. Thus, we will defer a discussion of potential 
candidate algorithms to Chapter 5.
Figure 3.11(a) shows the impact on the adapted pattern of replacing the 
ideal covariance with a finite sample estimate for the case considered in Figure 
3.8. Note the presence of very high sidelobes and a distorted main lobe (even 
though 30-dB Chebyshev angle and Doppler tapers were applied). However, 
as previously analyzed in Section 2.4, a potential remedy is the use of principal 
components or diagonal loading. Figure 3.11(b) shows the adapted pattern 
resulting from the addition of 10 dB of diagonal loading to the sample esti-
mate (along with 30-dB Chebyshev angle and Doppler tapers). It is important 
to note that these results still required a significant number of i.i.d. training 
data and, thus, may still not be practical.
3.5	 Summary
In this chapter, the rationale for joint 2-D space and time (angle-Doppler) 
processing was established. The detailed nature of the angle-Doppler structure 
of clutter was thoroughly examined from a variety of perspectives. In particu-
lar, a detailed eigen analysis of the space-time clutter covariance matrix was

performed and an expression (i.e., Brennan’s rule) for its rank as a function of β 
was derived. Next, an expression for the total space-time clutter-plusjamming-
plus-noise covariance was derived for the case of uncorrelated noise jamming. 
Utilizing the optimization framework established in Chapter 2, an expression 
for the optimal SINR space-time beamformer was derived and illustrated with 
a multiple jammer-plus-clutter scenario. Finally, STAP was introduced via the 
substitution of the ideal covariance matrix (unknown a priori) with an esti-
mate obtained from sample data. Some adapted pattern-distortion issues due 
to finite sample support (estimation errors) were also illustrated along with 
some rudimentary basic fixes (i.e., diagonal loading).
Problems
1.	 For the basic sidelooking ULA STAP case, β (see (3.3)) determines 
the rank of the clutter covariance matrix as well as the degree of 
Doppler spread.
a.	 What value of β will result in a total clutter Doppler spread of 
±PRF/4?
b.	 If the antenna is designed to perfectly reject signals from outside 
of ±60° off of boresight, what is the maximum absolute Doppler 
spread for the β = 1 case under the same operating conditions?
Figure 3.11  Impact of finite sample support on 2-D adapted patterns: (a) adapted 
pattern resulting from L = 2NM = 512 samples, and (b) result if 10 dB of diagonal loading 
is added. Both patterns include 30-dB Chebyshev angle and Doppler tapers.

2.	 A 2-D ULA can be viewed as vertical stacks of 1-D horizontal (azi-
muthal) ULAs. Assume that there are the usual N elements in each 
1-D ULA azimuthal row, and K vertical rows (all uniformly spaced), 
and that the usual sidelooking scenario parameters utilized through-
out Chapter 3 are the same (e.g., M pulses in a CPI).
a.	 Show that a 3-D steering vector v0 ∈ ℂNKM for a target at normal-
ized azimuth qo,  elevation jo,  and Doppler fdo , is given by vo = bo 
⊗ c0 ⊗ a0, where ao ∈ ℂN, bo ∈ ℂM are as defined previously in (3.4) 
and (3.8), and where co ∈ ℂK is the elevation steering vector given by  
1
e j2pjo
e j2p(2)jo
…
e j2p(K-1)jo
[
]
T .
b.	 Clearly, forming a 3-D STAP covariance matrix greatly exacerbates 
the many problems discussed throughout this book, including 
sample support,stationarity assumptions, and computational bur-
den. Given the long range operating assumptions of Chapter 3—for 
which elevation angle offers virtually no new information—can 
you think of a simple deterministic rank reduction method that 
reduces to the usual NM dimensional STAP problem?
c.	 Again, under the long range operating assumptions, there is an 
extremely high degree of clutter redundancy in the vertical rows of 
the 2-D ULA. Can you think of a way that this can be exploited 
in order to effectively enhance the number of independent samples 
at a given range bin in the NM dimensional covariance estima-
tion problem?
3.	 A fundamental assumption in the 2-D STAP formulation of Chapter 
3 was that the clutter was uncorrelated from range cell to range cell. In 
some applications, this may not be true; this is due to either large range 
sidelobes in pulse compression radars, or where so-called hot-clutter 
[32] (terrain scattered multipath jamming for example) is present.
a.	 Let do = [do1  do2  …  doQ] ∈ ℂQ denote the Q-dimensional 
range-bin (i.e., fast-time) steering vector for a signal of interest. 
Assuming that this vector is constant over a CPI, derive the cor-
responding 3D steering vector for a target with steering vectors ao 
∈ ℂN, bo ∈ ℂM, and do ∈ ℂQ.
b.	 Assume that the clutter interference in adjacent range bins have a 
correlation of ρ and zero elsewhere. Derive a block matrix repre-
sentation assuming that the normal STAP matrix R ∈ ℂNM×NM (as 
defined in (3.28)) is constant over all range bins. To simplify the 
result, assume only three range bins are utilized in a CPI.

Other Important Factors Affecting 
STAP Performance
4.1	 Introduction
Due to a multitude of practical considerations, the idealized performance 
presented in Chapter 3 represents a generally unachievable upper bound on 
performance—for both the known and iid sample estimate covariance cases. 
In this chapter, we will examine some of the salient factors that contribute 
to this degradation and must be considered when both designing a STAP 
system, as well as predicting realized performance. Most, if not all, of the 
factors described in this chapter are present to a greater or lesser degree in 
any STAP radar. Thus, when comparing various STAP algorithms (such as 
those described in Chapter 5 and elsewhere), careful attention should be paid 
to how they perform when one or more of the generally deleterious effects 
described herein is present.
This chapter is not meant to serve as a comprehensive treatise on fac-
tors that can affect STAP performance. It is, however, designed to illustrate 
an important phenomenon of real-world STAP systems: The effective clut-
ter/ interference rank is almost certainly greater than would be the case in 

80

idealized, simplified signal and systems models, and the rank increases with 
increasing interference-to-noise ratio (INR). This latter dependency on INR is 
referred to as the iceberg effect (see Section 4.6), since increasing INR tends 
to “lift” the colored interference eigenvalues further above the “ocean” noise 
floor—thereby exposing more of the “iceberg” (effective interference rank).
In varying clutter terrain situations, this can be a significant source of 
nonstationarity and often will result in wider Doppler clutter notches (and 
poorer minimum detectable velocities). Advanced methods for addressing 
these issues will be discussed and analyzed in Chapter 5.
Although a multitude of factors contribute to increasing the effective 
rank (as defined in Chapter 3) of the interference subspace, the net effect 
is essentially a decorrelation between spatial and temporal measurements 
(channels and/or pulses). The phenomena that give rise to this rank-increasing 
effect are referred to as interference subspace leakage, or ISL, since the decor-
relation tends to cause a smearing or leakage of the interference subspace [1]. 
For example, in the derivation of Brennan’s rule (Chapter 3), it was assumed 
that if the clutter was sampled at a later time (e.g., one PRI later) with an 
identical antenna channel observing from exactly the same spot, the total 
clutter return would be identical (i.e., perfectly correlated). If, however, ICM 
is present, the signals will not be the same, and the net effect is a decorrela-
tion between samples. Moreover, any mismatches between antenna channels 
could likewise cause differences in the observed signals, again potentially 
resulting in decorrelation.
As we will see later in this chapter, a convenient mathematical repre-
sentation of decorrelating ISL (and nondecorrelating channel mismatch) is 
via CMT [1–4]. Specifically, if R ∈ ℂNM×NM denotes the total interference 
covariance matrix, then the resultant covariance including all ISL effects has 
the form [1]
	
R
ISL
⎯→
⎯R  T1  T2  …  Tk R ∈NM ×NM 	
(4.1)
where T1, T2, … , Tk ∈ ℂNM×NM are positive-(semi-) definite Hermitian matrices 
associated with uncorrelated ISL phenomenon (such as ICM and decorrelat-
ing channel mismatch—see below), and ○ denotes Hadamard (elementwise) 
matrix multiplication (see Chapter 2).
This mathematical form turns out to be more than just a convenient 
compact representation of realistic covariance structure. For example in Chap-
ter 5, the CMT structure is explicitly incorporated into two STAP algorithms

81
(PC-CMT and SMI-CMT) that retain the desirable minimal sample support 
properties of principal-component and diagonal-loading SMI techniques (i.e., 
non-ISL environments) respectively, yet account for ISL effects without an 
increase in sample support requirements [1].
The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows: In Section 4.2 
we examine channel-mismatch effects, which are delineated into two major 
categories: bandwidth and angle-dependent effects. For example, in the nar-
rowband signal model case, channel mismatch results in an amplitude and 
phase offset between channels that can be modeled as an unknown (but fixed 
over the CPI) multiplicative complex scalar for each channel. This form of 
mismatch is nondecorrelating and is shown not to result in an increase in the 
effective interference rank, whereas in the finite (nonzero) bandwidth case, 
both bandwidth dispersion effects [5] and transfer function differences [6] 
result in decorrelating mismatch.
Angle-dependent channel-mismatch effects arise when the amount of 
channel mismatch depends on the AoA. For example, element position errors or 
mutual coupling [7] tend to have an angle dependency. However, as discussed 
in Section 4.2, since these errors are small to begin with, the dominant effects 
are associated with the look direction of the radar. Thus, the angle-dependent 
CMT T(θ) can be approximated by the fixed CMT T(θ) → T(θ 0) = T0 and 
then incorporated into (4.1).
Section 4.3 discusses other ISL effects such as ICM and range-walk. 
Again, it is shown that these effects result in a spatial and/or temporal decor-
relation that can be conveniently modeled by (4.1) (under certain general 
conditions).
Section 4.4 examines the impact of antenna misalignment with the 
ground-track velocity vector (i.e., crabbing [8]) on the effective clutter rank 
and derives an expression for the angle-Doppler clutter locus. A brief discussion 
of nonlinear array geometries is contained in Section 4.5, which also includes 
a circular array example.
Section 4.6 contains a discussion and illustration of the mechanism 
by which the aforementioned ISL phenomenon couple into CNR nonsta-
tionarity (which occurs in nature due to terrain variability [9]) to produce a 
more complex nonstationary vector stochastic process whose rank is likewise 
nonstationary ([1, 10]). This iceberg effect is fundamental, omnipresent, and 
must be accounted for in the STAP design stage (as illustrated in Chapter 
5)—otherwise clutter under-or overnulling will result [1]. More exotic radar 
applications such as bistatic space-time adaptive radar [11] generally only 
exacerbate this effect.

4.2	 Channel Mismatch
An important and ever-present factor affecting STAP performance is so-called 
channel mismatch (referred to colloquially as channel match). The N separate 
antenna channels employed in our ULA model have been assumed up to this 
point to be ideal; that is, the output response of a ULA was assumed to have 
a perfect linear phase (Vandermonde) response and no mismatch-induced 
decorrelation between channels.
In reality, it is impossible to have each channel pathway perfectly matched 
from an input-output perspective for all AoAs. For analysis purposes, it is con-
venient to taxonomize each contributing channel-mismatch source based on 
whether or not it is dependent on AoA and whether it is narrowband (or not). 
Angle-dependent channel-mismatch errors are often due to array manifold and 
possibly radome effects (e.g., element position errors and pattern differences, 
near field scattering and multipath) and are often quite complex and difficult 
to model and/or predict accurately [1, 6, 12]. Angle-independent sources are 
generally due to mismatches between the channels after the antenna elements 
[6, 12].
To facilitate the analysis of channel mismatch, we will adopt the CMT 
framework that provides a convenient and unifying mathematical framework 
for a broad class of channel mismatch [1, 2]. Moreover, this framework will 
also prove useful when examining other subspace leakage phenomenon such 
as ICM, as well as when considering model-based minimal sample support 
STAP methods in Chapter 5.
4.2.1  Angle-Independent Channel Mismatch
Angle-independent channel mismatch is due to variations between the trans-
fer functions, Hn (ω), n = 1, … , N, associated with each receive channel (see 
Figure 4.1) without angle-dependent effects (see following discussion). We 
will first consider the ideal narrowband case in which each transfer function 
simplifies to a complex gain multiplier.
4.2.1.1  Narrowband Case
The impact of angle-independent narrowband channel mismatch that is stable 
over a CPI (normally the case) is the introduction of unknown but constant 
gain and phase differences (i.e., mismatch) between channels. This is con-
veniently modeled as a constant tapering of all signal vectors impinging on 
the array. Specifically, if ai denotes the steering vector associated with the ith 
incoming signal, then the resulting actual array response vector âi is given by

	
Other Important Factors Affecting STAP Performance
83
	
âi = ai ○ t	
(4.2)
where t is an N-dimensional vector (or taper) of the form
	
t = [e1e jj1  … eNe jjN ]T 	
(4.3)
In (4.3), ∈1, … , ∈N and φ 1, … , φ N denote the amplitude and phase errors, 
respectively. The amplitude errors represent the differences in gain through 
each channel, and thus 0 ≤ ∈i ≤ 1 for i = 1, … , N. Typically, the variation in 
gain is quite small and is usually less than 0.1 dB (i.e., ~ 0.99 ≤ ∈i ≤ 1). Typi-
cal values for phase errors are 5° or less. Note that in general ‖t‖ ≤ 1. Also, 
it has been tacitly assumed that the noise floor in each channel is identical.
As discussed in Chapter 2, these errors introduce a signal mismatch that 
limits achievable tapered sidelobe levels and signal integration gain. For a given 
mismatch taper t, the SNR loss ratio, defined as the ratio of the realized SNR 
to optimum SNR [see (2.22)] is given by

T = tt′ ∈ ℂN × N	
(4.5)
is a rank-one matrix referred to as a CMT [2]. The final factored form made 
use of the Hadamard matrix multiplication identity
	
(A ○ B)(C ○ D)′ = (AC′) ○ (BD′)	
(4.6)
where A, B are m × n and C, D are n × p matrices [13]. Note that in the absence 
of channel mismatch, T is the Hadamard identity matrix (i.e., matrix with all 
unity entries) [13], and (4.4) reduces to unity (i.e., no loss).
In a well-calibrated radar, the SNR loss due to signal mismatch is quite 
small (~1 dB or less). Of greater concern in general is the impact of channel 
mismatch on interference suppression. For the angle-independent narrowband 
case, each signal impinging on the array is tapered according to (4.2). Thus, 
the total received space-time interference signal is of the form
	
X = Xc + X J + n

(4.7)
where Xc, XJ, n ∈ ℂNM denote the space-time clutter, jamming, and receiver 
noise RVs, respectively. Note that the mismatch taper only affects the struc-
tured (colored) noise signals and not the thermal or white noise. This is a con-
sequence of assuming that each channel has the same noise floor (differences 
in receiver noise levels can be viewed as differences in SNR, which ultimately 
can be represented as differences in signal gain for a fixed noise-floor level).
If only spatial channel mismatch is present, that is, (4.2), then the cor-
responding space-time mismatch taper, t, in (4.7) is of the form

Examining (4.7) in further detail, we see that the first sum is due to clut-
ter (see Chapter 3) with the inclusion of mismatches, while the second sum 
is due to NJ uncorrelated jammers (see Chapters 2 and 3). Assuming that the 
clutter, jamming, and receiver noise obey the aforementioned statistical mod-
els described in Chapters 2 and 3, and that they are mutually uncorrelated,

(4.9)
where RI = RI ○ T, and RI is the total interference covariance matrix (clutter 
plus jamming) in the absence of mismatch. T is the rank-one CMT associated 
with the mismatch; that is, T = tt′.
An important result regarding the impact of simple channel mismatch 
on STAP performance can be immediately inferred from (4.9) based on the 
properties of Hadamard products. Specifically, since rank(A ○ B) ≤ rank(A) 
rank(B), we have [13]
	
rank ( RI ) = rank(RI   T)
= rank RI   (tt¢)
(
)
≤rank(RI )rank(T)
= rank(RI )rank(tt¢)
	
(4.10)
However, since rank(T) = rank(tt′) = 1, we immediately see that
	
rank (R̃I) ≤ rank (RI)	
(4.11)
That is, the rank of the total interference covariance matrix cannot be increased 
by simple angle-independent narrowband channel mismatch. The practical 
consequence of this result is that optimum nulling performance is essentially 
unaffected (there is slight degradation when amplitude mismatch is present—
see following discussion). However, there will still be a small amount of SNR 
loss due to steering-vector mismatch as described by (4.4). Also, limits on 
nominal tapered sidelobe levels will also be present as described in Chapter 2.

86	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
Stronger statements regarding the exact impact of simple channel mis-
match can be derived for certain special cases. For example, for phase only 
mismatch, the eigenvalues of the total interference covariance matrix can be 
shown to be invariant to the phase errors. Coupled with the rank property 
of (4.11), this implies that no loss in nulling performance is incurred (there is 
still a small signal-mismatch loss). To see this explicitly, we begin by assum-
ing that t is of the form

To prove the eigenvalue invariance property, we need to show that the set

where δij denotes the Kronecker delta function. Note that t* ○ t = [1  1  …  1]
T since each element of t is of the form ejφi (unity modulus). Thus, the eigenval-
ues of RI ○ T + σ 2I are the same as RI + σ 2I, and the eigenvectors of RI ○ T + 
σ 2I are those of RI + σ 2I modified by the phase-only mismatch taper; that is, 
ui → ui ○ t. Note, however, that if amplitude errors are present, the eigenvalues 
are not invariant (which impacts SINR—although very modestly in practice).
Figure 4.2 shows the optimum beam pattern (with a 30-dB Chebyshev 
taper) with channel mismatch for the six-jammer case described in Section 
2.2. The phase-only channel-mismatch taper, t, was selected from a 5° (one-
sigma) Gaussian random-number generator. In generating the adapted pattern, 
modified DFT vectors are required since plane waves impinging on the array 
no longer obey a perfect linear phase response. If [s0  …  sj  …] denotes 
the DFT vectors used to generate the optimum response in the absence of 
mismatch, then modified DFT vectors of the form [s0 ○ t  …  sj ○ t  …] 
are required to generate the correct response when mismatch is present.
As expected, the adapted pattern has nulls placed at the jammer loca-
tions and an average sidelobe level of approximately 30 dB (variations due 
to channel mismatch). The corresponding SNR loss computed from (4.4) is 
0.6 dB—an extremely modest loss. Indeed, as emphasized in Chapter 2, the 
ability of adaptive beamforming to effect deep nulls even in the presence of 
certain channel mismatches is a major practical benefit.
4.2.1.2  Finite (Nonzero) Bandwidth Case
For the finite (nonzero) bandwidth case, the N receive channel transfer func-
tions, Hn (ω), n = 1, … , N, can no longer be simply modeled as unknown 
scalar complex gain multipliers (i.e., a rank-one CMT). Instead, the instanta-
neous frequency content of a PRI (pulse spectrum) is subtly altered between 
channels. The net effect for a stochastic signal (i.e., clutter and jamming) is 
a decorrelation of the signals between channels. To see why this is the case, 
we first recall the form of the received total interference signal with channel 
mismatch given by (4.7), but with t a vector RV (as opposed to a fixed, but 
unknown, constant vector). Since we are focusing on spatial decorrelation 
effects resulting from channel-to-channel random mismatch [6, 12], it suf-
fices to analyze the pairwise cross correlation between channels. Specifically,

property 0 ≤ ⎪Ti,k⎪ ≤ 1, although in practice it is much closer to unity than

nulls at the jammer locations to effectively cancel the interference.

In matrix form, (4.16) becomes
	
R = RI ○ T + σ 2I	
(4.17)
where R is the spatial-only covariance matrix, and T = E{tt′} is the CMT associ-
ated with the channel mismatch. Equation (4.17) is of the same mathematical 
form as (4.9) with one major exception: T is generally full rank. Thus, unlike 
the simple rank-one narrowband CMT, the presence of decorrelating channel 
mismatch will alter the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the interference covari-
ance matrix and may increase the effective rank of the colored-noise subspace 
(see the following discussion) [1]. This increased effective rank, in turn, will 
often result in a widening of the angle-Doppler nulls—thereby reducing the 
amount of observation space available for target detection.
To illustrate the impact of decorrelating random amplitude and phase 
channel mismatch on the interference signal, consider a simple uncorrelated 
amplitude and phase mismatch model:

(4.19)
where p(δ ∈i) and p(φ i) are the pdfs (uniform) associated with the amplitude 
and phase errors respectively. Note that other authors have used different 
stochastic representations to model decorrelating channel mismatch (e.g., [6, 
12, 14, 15])—all of which are but approximations to the actually underlying 
mismatch mechanisms. In practice, the correlation coefficients required by 
(4.16) would be measured experimentally as part of the calibration process. 
Once known, a CMT comprised of those coefficients completely characterizes 
the effects from an SINR standpoint. That said, we continue with the analyti-
cal illustration: With (4.18) and (4.19), we can now calculate the elements of 
the spatial-only CMT as follows:

Thus, T is of the following linear matrix form:
	
T = ρ 11 + ρ 2I	
(4.22)
where 1 is the rank-one Hadamard identity matrix [13] (all elements equal 
unity), I is the usual identity matrix, and

91
where the Hadamard product identities RI ○ 1 = RI and RI ○ I = diag{RI} 
were invoked (diag{RI} is a diagonal matrix whose entries are the diagonal 
elements of RI). From (4.25) we see that the net effect of uniform decorrelat-
ing channel mismatch is to effectively raise the white-noise floor (increased 
diagonal entries). Thus, for this particular case, the spatial colored-noise-only 
covariance rank is unaffected (although the effective rank (Chapter 3) may 
change since the INR has changed). However, this is not generally the case 
for the space-time clutter rank as illustrated below. Nor is it generally the case 
when the mismatch is nonuniform, that is, when the off-diagonal terms of 
T are not identical—which, in other words, means the pairwise correlation 
between channels is nonuniform.
Note also that in the absence of amplitude modulation, that is, Δϵ = 0, 
ρ 2 = 1 − ρ 1, and thus (4.22) is a convex sum of the Hadamard and ordinary 
identity matrices. The resulting covariance is of the form

The expression in (4.22) is for the spatial-only CMT. The corresponding 
full-dimensional space-time CMT is simply given by
	
T = 1M×M ⊗ Tspace 	
(4.27)
where 1M×M is the M × M Hadamard identity matrix, and Tspace denotes the 
spatial-only CMT.
Equation (4.27) is a special case of a more general expression
	
T = Ttime ⊗ Tspace	
(4.28)
when there are also temporal mismatches and/or decorrelating effects 
that are uncorrelated with the spatial factors (e.g., ICM). A proof of (4.28)

is relatively straightforward: Let tt ∈ ℂM, ts ∈ ℂN denote the uncorrelated 
temporal and spatial vector RVs, respectively, with corresponding correlation 
matrices cov (tt ) = Ttime ∈ ℂM×M, cov(ts ) = Tspace ∈ ℂN×N, then cov(tt ⊗ ts) 
≜ T is given by

(4.29)
where use was made of the Kronecker identity (A ⊗ B)(C ⊗ D)′=(AC′) ⊗ (BD′) 
[13] (where conformality of the constituent matrix dimensions is assumed). 
We will make use of (4.28) later in this book when a multitude of spatial and 
temporal effects are present simultaneously.
To gain insight into the impact decorrelating channel mismatch can 
have on the space-time clutter covariance matrix, recall from Chapter 3 the 
Riemann sum approximation for the total space-time clutter RV Xc ∈ ℂNM,

tor corresponding to the ith clutter patch (see Chapter 3) with corresponding 
temporal bi ∈ ℂM and spatial ai ∈ ℂN steering vectors. Uniform spatial-only 
decorrelating channel mismatch alters (4.30) as follows:

which is of the factored form in (4.17) with a CMT of the form given by 
(4.27). Note that the above derivation depends on the angle-independence 
of the decorrelating channel mismatch. However, as shown below, even for 
angle-dependent mismatch, it is still possible to approximate the resultant 
covariance with the factored form.
To illustrate the impact of decorrelating channel-mismatch errors on 
the space-time clutter eigenspectrum, consider the following three cases: (1) 
∆ϵ = 0, ∆φ = 0° , that is, no errors; (2) ∆ϵ = 0.01, ∆φ = 2° ; and (3) ∆ϵ = 0.02, 
∆φ = 5°. To make a fair comparison, we will hold the original CNR constant 
regardless of the amount of mismatch. This is tantamount to adjusting the 
original white-noise floor in (4.17) to preserve CNR as defined in Chapter 3.
Figure 4.3(a) shows the total interference eigenvalues for the three cases. 
Note that the effective rank of the clutter is increased due to the presence of 
decorrelating channel mismatches, which will have a deleterious impact on 
SINR performance. Figure 4.3(b) shows the impact on SINR loss. Note the 
increased width in the mainbeam clutter notch—resulting in poorer low-
Doppler-shift signal detection. Also evident is the effective increase in the 
noise floor as a consequence of the structure of (4.22) and (4.26).
In general, both the simple rank-one CMT of (4.9), denoted as T1, and 
the (generally) full-rank CMT of (4.22), denoted as T2, will be present. The

net effect, assuming that the errors are uncorrelated, is a composite CMT of 
the form
	
T = T1 ○ T2	
(4.33)
A proof of the Hadamard multiplicative property can be found in [1] and is 
based on the fact that the expected value of the product of two uncorrelated 
RVs is simply the product of the their expected values [16]. Specifically, con-
sider the (i, k)th element of (4.33); that is,

where t1, t2 ∈ ℂNM are the vector RV modulations with associated correlation 
matrices T1, T2 ∈ ℂNM×NM, respectively. Note that the above argument can be 
repeated to accommodate any number of uncorrelated random effects, result-
ing in the Hadamard factored form of (4.1).
An interesting fact associated with the Hadamard product of two matri-
ces is that if T1 and T2 are both positive-definite, then T = T1 ○ T2 is also 
guaranteed to be positive-definite as a direct consequence of the Schur Prod-
uct theorem [13]. While the reader can consult [13] for a general proof (and 
extensions), it is obvious from (4.34) that this should be the case since T1 ○ 
T2 can be associated with a finite covariance stochastic process t1 ○ t2 [1].
Before we leave this section, mention should be made of how the col-
loquial term cancellation ratio, or CR [6, 12], usually specified in decibels, 
relates to the preceding discussion. CR is defined as the expected value 
of the normalized energy residue (in decibels) resulting from subtracting 
signals from two different channels [6]. Thus, if the correlation coefficient 
between two adjacent channels is ρ, then the cancellation ratio (in decibels) 
is defined as
	
CR (dB)  10 log10 (1 − ρ)–1	
(4.35)

96	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
For example, if ρ = 0 (no correlation between channels), then the CR is 0 dB 
(no cancellation). If ρ = 0.9, the CR is 10 dB. The CR is simply a measure 
of the pairwise correlation between channels. The CMT framework of this 
section shows explicitly how to relate the correlation between channels (and 
thus the CR between channels) to its impact on interference cancellation. 
Namely, if the pairwise correlation between channels is uniform and equal 
to ρ, (which could be experimentally determined), then the corresponding 
spatial-only CMT is simply given by

4.2.2  Angle-Dependent Channel Mismatch
Due to the potential presence of a multitude of array manifold effects (mutual 
coupling, near-field multipath, element position errors, bandwidth dispersion 
[3], and so forth), T of (4.33) may be a function of AoA; that is,
	
T = T(θ)	
(4.37)
which can significantly complicate the analysis of the impact on the interfer-
ence covariance matrix with no mismatch errors. Specifically, when present, 
the total (clutter plus jamming plus noise) covariance matrix R is of the form
	
R = cov Xc
(
) + cov X J1
(

(4.39)
where RJ1 is the covariance associated with the ith jammer in the absence of 
channel mismatch, and T(θ J1) is the total CMT for jammer AoA θ J1. The 
expression for cov(Xc) is more complicated due to the fact that clutter originates 
from all angles (in general). Specifically, from Chapter 3 we have

(4.40)
where we have assumed that the clutter and random RV mismatch error are 
uncorrelated. Notice that since T(θ i) is inside the summation, cov (XC)is not 
of the previously encountered factored form R ○ T. However, in a normally 
operating radar, the transmit and receive antenna patterns are pointing in 
the same direction. This implies that Gi will have a significant maximum in 
the look direction. Since the effect of a CMT is the introduction of sideband 
energy that is generally several (if not many) orders of magnitude down from 
the primary (mainbeam) unmodulated eigenvectors (see [1] and the discussion 
on the PC-CMT technique in Chapter 5), only the dominant eigenvectors 
will generally play a role in introducing subspace leakage.
The practical consequence of these observations is that the unfactored 
result of (4.40) can reasonably be approximated by the factored result
	
cov(Xc ) ≈ Rc ○ T(θ 0)	
(4.41)
where Rc is the covariance in the absence of angle-dependent channel mis-
match, and T(θ 0) is the CMT associated with the radar transmit-receive look 
direction θ 0.
Combining (4.41) with (4.38) and (4.39) yields a simplified, yet useful, 
result for the impact of angle-dependent channel mismatch when both clutter 
and jamming are present; that is,

One potential source of angle-dependent channel-to-channel spatial 
decorrelation is antenna dispersion due to finite bandwidth [7, 17]. Referring 
back to Figure 2.1, we see that the absolute time delay between the kth and 
nth channels in a ULA is

t n−k = n −k d
c sinq 	
(4.43)
where c is the speed of light, d is the element separation (consistent units 
assumed), and θ is the angle off boresight (as defined in Chapter 2). For the 
finite (nonzero) bandwidth case, the receiver (pulse) will have an autocorrela-
tion function associated with it [18]. For an ideal bandpass, with bandwidth 
B (hertz), the corresponding autocorrelation function, r(τ), is given by [16]:
	
r(τ) = sinc (Bτ)	
(4.44)
where to be consistent, τ is expressed in seconds. Other correlation functions 
are of course possible, such as that corresponding to a linear frequency modu-
lation (LFM) with a temporal taper for range sidelobe reduction.
The corresponding angle-dependent CMT is thus given by

Although for a side-looking radar the peak of the mainbeam is nominally 
pointing at θ = 0°, for which τ m = 0, it is not advisable to ignore the above 
dispersion since mainbeam clutter is still spread in angle. A reasonable approxi-
mate angle-independent CMT for this case [i.e., (4.41)] is T(∆θ), where ∆θ is 
some suitable measure of mainbeam width. Figure 4.4 illustrates an example 
of the impact of antenna dispersion on the clutter rank.
4.3	 Other Interference Subspace Leakage Effects
ISL [1] refers generally to situations in which an increase in the rank of the 
colored noise (clutter and/or jamming) is present. As we saw in the previous 
section, decorrelating channel mismatch can cause an increase in rank and is 

	
Other Important Factors Affecting STAP Performance
99
thus a special case of ISL. There are, in general, many other ISL mechanisms. 
For example, random amplitude and/or phase modulation of the clutter signal 
will generally cause an increase in its rank.
One common example is ICM [4, 9, 19] (e.g., wind-blown foliage—an 
extensive research and measurement study was recently conducted by Bill-
ingsley of MIT Lincoln Laboratory [19]). A product of this investigation is a 
very useful and accurate empirical exponential model that captures the salient 
characteristics of ICM and is colloquially referred to as the Billingsley model. 
The only parameters required to specify the clutter Doppler power spectrum 
are essentially the operating wavelength and wind speed. Specifically,
	
Pc( f ) =
r

r +1
bl

(4.47)
where Pc(f ) is the clutter Doppler psd, λ is the operating wavelength, f is the 
Doppler frequency (hertz), and δ(⋅) is the Dirac delta function. The shape

parameter b depends primarily on wind conditions and has been tabulated 
[19]. The ratio r, 0 ≤ r ≤ ∞, between the dc [first term in (4.47)] and ac compo-
nents (second term) was found to be a function of both the carrier frequency 
and wind speed [19], namely,
	
10 log r = −15.5 log w − 12.1 log fc + 63.2	
(4.48)
where w is the wind speed in miles per hour (mph), fc is the carrier frequency 
in megahertz, and log(⋅) is the base 10 logarithm.
The corresponding correlation (temporal) function is given by the inverse 
Fourier transform of (4.48) [4], that is,
	
rc(t) =

(4.49)
The CMT corresponding to this ICM model is easily obtained by sam-
pling rc(τ) at multiples of the PRI; that is, rc(0) (first pulse), rc (PRI) (correla-
tion between first and second pulses), … , rc((M − 1)PRI) (correlation between 
first and last (Mth) pulses [4]. The full-up space-time CMT is thus given by
	
T =TICM ⊗ 1N×N	
(4.50)
where
	
[TICM]i,j = rc(⎪i − j⎪PRI)	
(4.51)
Note that ICM is a temporal modulation effect, as evidenced by (4.50), which 
is a special case of (4.28).
Figure 4.5 shows an example of the impact of ICM on both the eigenspec-
trum and SINR for a modest average wind speed of 10 mph. Note that similar 
to the decorrelating channel-mismatch case, the most significant impact is 
an increase in the mainbeam clutter notch—with a commensurate decrease 
in MDV.
Another potential source of ISL is so-called range walk, which can 
occur due to range-bin migration of the clutter during a CPI (see [20] and 
references cited therein). Figure 4.6 illustrates this effect for the general case 
when the look direction is not broadside. Since, to a reasonable approxima-
tion, the amount of correlation is proportional to the amount of area overlap

ΔA (see Figure 4.6), we see that this effect is in general angle-dependent—
with a minimum at broadside and a maximum in the forward-looking direc-
tion. However, for the same reason cited above, a useful approximation can 
be obtained by considering the amount of correlation in the look direction 
thereby resulting in an approximate, but angle-independent, CMT. Assuming 
a relatively short CPI with a constant velocity, we see from Figure 4.6 that the 
correlation ρ between successive pulses is approximately given by

where ∆θ is the mainbeam width, and ∆R is the range-bin size—which is 
taken to be c/B, where c is the speed of light and B is the bandwidth of the 
compressed pulse (consistent units assumed).
For a short CPI, it is reasonable to assume that the change in area overlap 
is approximately constant between successive pulses. Thus, if the correlation 
between successive pulses is ρ, the temporal correlation between the mth and 
nth pulses, denoted by ρ m,n, is then simply given by
	
ρ m,n = ρ⎪m–n⎪	
(4.53)
The corresponding temporal CMT is therefore of the form

Note that this has a similar (not identical) structure to the ICM case inasmuch 
as there is a monotonic decrease in correlation with increasing PRI separation. 
Thus, the resulting clutter eigenspectrum will have a similar appearance to 
that of the ICM case.
4.4	 Antenna Array Misalignment
Brennan’s rule, as derived in Chapter 3, assumed that the ULA antenna was 
aligned with the ground velocity vector. In fact, this was crucial for showing 
that the clutter rank was generally significantly less than the total spatiotem-
poral DoFs [i.e., the redundancy argument demonstrated in (3.18)]. Moreover, 
when aligned, the back lobe clutter exactly coincides with the front lobe clutter 
as a function of angle-Doppler as evidenced by an examination of Figure 3.1 
and (3.1) [8]. In practice, it is not possible to maintain antenna alignment to 
ground track (e.g., aircraft crabbing and implementation constraints). Con-
sequently, the clutter rank (and angle-Doppler spectrum) is altered.
The impact of velocity misalignment on the angle-Doppler relationship 
of ground clutter (at long ranges) is the introduction of a so-called crab angle 
θ c in (3.1) as follows [8]:
	
fd = 2vT
l sin q + qc
(
) 	
(4.55)

104	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
Note that the symmetry between back lobe and front lobe has generally been 
lost. Specifically, with θ c = 0 (i.e., no crab) there is even Doppler frequency 
symmetry about the nose of the aircraft; that is, sin p
2 + a
⎛
⎝⎜
⎞
⎠⎟ = sin p
2 −a
⎛
⎝⎜
⎞
⎠⎟,  
for ⎪α⎪ ≤ π, where α is the angle of a given clutter patch with respect to the 
nose of the aircraft. Front and back lobe clutter will thus lie along the same 
angle-Doppler contour. With θ c ≠ 0, sin p
2 + a
⎛
⎝⎜
⎞
⎠⎟ ≠ sin p
2 −a
⎛
⎝⎜
⎞
⎠⎟,  for ⎪α⎪ 
≤ π. This will result in a so-called back lobe ridge, which may be of concern 
in strong clutter with poorly attenuated back lobes [8].
Another observation gleaned from (4.55) is that there is no longer a 
strictly linear relationship between normalized angle and Doppler [i.e., (3.2)] 
no longer holds. Instead, the clutter locus forms an ellipse [8]. To see this 
explicitly, we manipulate (4.55) as follows:
	
fd = 2vT
l sin q + qc
(
)
= 2vT
l
sin q
( )cos qc
( ) + cos q
( )sin qc
( )
⎡⎣
⎤⎦

( )sin qc
( )
⎡⎣
⎤⎦
	
(4.56)
where
	
b = 2vT
d , h = d
l 	
(4.57)
Rearranging (4.56) and employing a trigonometric identity, we have
	
fd −bqd cosqc = bhcosqsinqc
= ±bh 1−sin2 q sinqc
	
(4.58)
where the expression for normalized angle qd = hsinq  is inserted and the 
trigonometric identity cosq = ± 1−sin2 q  is employed. Squaring both sides 
of (4.58) and rearranging terms yields
	
fd
2 + b2qd
2 −2bcosqc fdqd −b2h2 sin2 qc = 0 	
(4.59)
Equation (4.59) yields a rotated ellipse in the normalized angle-Doppler coor-
dinates. The standard form for a rotated (and generally translated) ellipse is 
given by [21]

105
	
Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0	
(4.60)
Comparing this with (4.59) yields the following assignments
	
x = qd
y = fd
A = b2
B = −2bcosqc
C = 1
D = E = 0
F = −b2h2 sin2 qc
	
(4.61)
from which it is evident that the ellipse is centered at the origin, but is rotated 
from the qd  axis by an angle ϕ given by [21]
	
cot2f = A −C
B
= 1−b2
2bcosqc
B ≠0
	
(4.62)
Note that for β 2 = 1, cot 2ϕ = 0, which implies that f = p
4 ,  that is, an ellipse 
oriented at 45°.
Figure 4.7 displays angle-Doppler contours for different values of crab 
angle, along with corresponding clutter-plus-noise eigenspectrum and Capon 
power-spectral densities. Note the appearance of a second clutter ridge whose 
strength is determined by the back lobe rejection level of the array.

antenna was aligned with the ground-referenced velocity vector. Indeed, it was

ratio is fixed to 30 dB.
because of this assumption (and several others) that a generally lower rank for 
the clutter eigenspectrum was realized. When this assumption is violated—as 
is the case in Section 4.4 due to crabbing—the rank of the clutter is generally 
increased. Unfortunately, this rank inflation also arises when nonlinear array 
geometries are employed (even if the geometrical axis of the array is aligned 
with the ground-referenced velocity vector) [8]. As with the crabbing case, the 
violation of Brennan’s rule is easily established since the requisite linear phase 
relationship and redundancy in (3.26) no longer hold.
There are obviously too many possible nonlinear array geometries to con-
template them all in this venue. However, an increasingly popular configuration

is the so-called circular array [22, 23]. A static (nonrotating), electronically 
scanned, circular array can eliminate the need for bulky, heavy, and energy-
consuming mechanically scanned servos, as well as provide enhanced track-
while-scan (TWS) capabilities [22].
Figure 4.8 illustrates an example UHF linear and circular array con-
figuration. To insure the formation of proper transmit and receive pat-
terns, only a subsection of the total circular array is active [23]. Note that 
to make a fair comparison with the linear case, a few extra elements are 
included in the circular subsection to maintain an approximately equiva-
lent aperture size.
Figure 4.9 shows the impact of circular-array geometry on the clutter–
plus-noise eigenspectrum or the case of 30-dB and 100-dB back lobe rejec-
tion. Note that as with the crabbing array, low back lobe rejection can have a 
major impact on clutter spread.

4.6	 Interference Nonstationarity and the Iceberg Effect
Due to both man-made and natural variations in terrain, real-world clutter 
is heterogeneous [24]. Thus, the statistics (e.g., pdf, CNR, and correlation 
properties) will vary with location. This fact obviously presents a severe chal-
lenge to any adaptive clutter-cancellation scheme that must estimate requisite 
statistical information on the fly.
To begin to appreciate the impact nonstationarity can have on STAP 
performance, we first consider perhaps the simplest form of heterogeneity, 
namely CNR variation. Figure 4.10 shows the impact of a change in CNR for 
the ideal ULA case (for which Brennan’s rule holds) and for the more realistic 
case in which subspace leakage is present (10-mph ICM). Note that for the 
low CNR case, the effective ranks of the clutter eigenspectra are approxi-
mately equal. However, for high CNR, there is a significant increase in the 
rank when subspace leakage is present. If one thinks of the white-noise floor 
(0 dB on graph) as the surface of a perfectly calm “ocean,” and the clutter-
only eigenspectrum as an “iceberg,” one can see that the increase in effective 
clutter rank with increasing CNR is analogous to an iceberg rising above the 
ocean surface. Although ICM was used to provide the additional subspace 
leakage, any of the decorrelating effects described in this chapter will produce 
the same qualitative result.
This iceberg effect can have a significant impact on sample covariance- 
(adaptive-) based beamforming. As a simple illustration, consider an ideal 
Figure 4.9  Impact of nonlinear-array geometry on clutter eigenspectrum for back 
lobe rejection ratios of (a) 30 dB and (b) 100 dB. First 250 eigenvalues displayed. (Data

side-looking ULA (no crab) where the CNR decreases from 70 to 20 dB 
over a range support of 6,000 samples (bins), where N = M = 16, and there 
is 10-mph ICM. This power variation can simply be the result of decreasing 
CNR with increasing range from the radar [24], or it can be due to gradual 
variations in terrain elevation or coverage [24].
Figure 4.11 shows SINR versus Doppler and range for both the ideal 
optimum (known-covariance) and estimated covariance (2NM SMI centered 
at range bin 3,000) cases. The additional loss in the near-in ranges is due to 
clutter undernulling (i.e., the notch width and depth are inadequate), while 
the loss in the far range bins is due to clutter overnulling (i.e., notch width 
and depth are too large—resulting in unnecessary target signal loss). In both 
cases, the biggest impact is on the minimum detectable velocity (MDV), which 
is defined as the velocity at which SINR loss is 10 dB (see [11] for further dis-
cussion of MDV and alternate definitions). For GMTI radar, this severe loss 
in MDV (mainbeam clutter notch width) may be undesirable [25].
Figure 4.10  Illustration of the iceberg effect, which describes the increase in 
interference rank (eigenvalues above noise floor) with increasing CNR when realistic 
eigenspectra are considered (i.e., Brennan’s rule no longer holds). Note that for low 
CNR the effect is negligible, while for large CNR it can be quite significant.

achieved when exact covariance is used for each range bin, and (b) actual SINR 
performance when a 2NM sample (centered at range bin 3,000) covariance is used. 
The additional SINR loss at near-in range bins is due to clutter undernulling, while 
the additional loss at far ranges is due to overnulling. This example illustrates the 
importance of tracking clutter statistics for optimal performance.

4.7	 Summary
In this chapter, we touched upon a few of the many real-world effects that 
can have a significant impact on STAP performance, as compared with so-
called ideal performance. Although one cannot reduce the effective rank of 
the colored-interference subspace when ISL and other rank-inflation mecha-
nisms are present, judicious algorithm design can minimize its impact. This 
is a primary consideration in the next chapter.

STAP for Radar: Methods, Algorithms, 
and Performance
5.1	 Introduction
Although in theory we have already specified the theoretically optimum strat-
egy for space-time filtering of interference—that is, the ubiquitous Wiener-
Hopf equation w = R–1s—many practical considerations (described in previous 
chapters and elsewhere [1–4]) preclude its direct implementation. Most notable 
is the fact that the interference covariance matrix R is unknown a priori and 
must be estimated on the fly, then utilized in an appropriate real-time space-
time filtering architecture. Even in so-called stationary Gaussian environ-
ments (which, in fact, never truly exist) when a sample covariance estimate is 
indicated (see Section 2.4), care must be taken to avoid erratic sidelobe levels 
introduced due to estimation errors and potentially limited sample support. 
Even greater care is required when confronted with nonstationary environ-
ments—particularly when ISL and other rank-inflating phenomenon (crab-
bing, nonlinear array geometries, and so forth) are present.
In this chapter, we introduce a broad range of STAP algorithms that 
have been developed (many in recent years) to combat one or more of the 
aforementioned performance degrading effects. Although it is not practical 
to consider every current STAP algorithm that has been proposed (a keyword 
search on “STAP” should suffice to make the point), a representative sampling 

116	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
of algorithms drawn from a STAP taxonomy are analyzed in this chapter. 
It should be mentioned that our emphasis here is on performance and not 
specifically on implementation complexity. Certain key aspects of real-time 
STAP will be explored in Chapter 6.
Figure 5.1 illustrates a STAP algorithm taxonomy. All of these algo-
rithms either explicitly or implicitly attempt to reduce the dimensionality of 
the unknown interference parameters via a rank-reducing transformation or 
an explicit model-based method (or potentially both), while still preserving 
acceptable performance [1]. Thus, although the STAP CPI dimension NM 
might be quite large, the dimension of the unknown parameters vector or 
matrix could be substantially less—since clutter is generally restricted in angle-
Doppler space [1, 2, 5]. This reduced-dimension adaptivity is only possible if 
additional prior knowledge of the interference is assumed. Indeed, it is critical 
to know what prior knowledge is explicitly or implicitly assumed in order to 
select an algorithm appropriate to a given radar scenario.
For example, in post-Doppler methods [an example of a reduced-rank 
linear transformation (RLT) data-independent method is shown in Figure 5.1], 
an assumption on the Doppler extent of ground clutter is exploited to subband 
the rejection problem [1, 2, 5]. Thus, a different, but substantially reduced-rank 
(or reduced-dimension) adaptive problem is solved for each Doppler bin. Since 
a much smaller covariance matrix is utilized in these methods, it can provide 
significant advantages in nonstationary environments and also be substantially 
easier to implement. Under certain conditions, which may or may not be suf-
ficiently satisfied in any given application, post-Doppler methods can closely 
approximate the performance of optimum full-DoF STAP [1, 2].
An example of an explicit model-based algorithm that can reduce the 
effective adaptive DoFs is Toeplitz matrix fitting [6, 7]. For an ideal sidelook-
ing ULA (no crab or channel mismatch) and uniform PRF in the presence of 
uniform uncorrelated clutter scatterers (such as considered in Chapter 3), the 
ideal STAP covariance matrix has a Toeplitz-block-Toeplitz (TBT) structure 
[1, 2, 6, 7]. The redundancy in the covariance structure effectively reduces 
the dimension of the unknown parameter vector (unknown elements of cova-
riance matrix) which, in turn, reduces requirements on sample support for 
estimation—a highly desirable property in nonstationary environments or 
where sample support is limited by other factors (e.g., radar horizon). How-
ever, the Toeplitz assumption is an approximation at best and thus must be 
applied judiciously.
The remainder of Chapter 5 will be spent exploring the STAP taxonomy 
tree of Figure 5.1 and comparing the different methods in a variety of simu-
lated, but nonetheless realistic scenarios. Though this treatise is not exhaustive,

the reader should gain a foundation from which to craft a custom STAP solu-
tion well suited to his or her application.
A unique pedagogical feature of this chapter is the explicit mathemati-
cal derivation of an effective covariance inverse (ECI), denoted by RI
eff, for each 
STAP algorithm. That is, each reduced-dimension STAP algorithm can be 
shown to result in a mathematical form
	
w = RI
effs	
(5.1)
where RI
eff is always an NM × NM matrix. Adopting this approach not only 
significantly aids in the mathematical analysis of various methods, but also 
provides insight into precisely how a particular algorithm works—an invalu-
able aid when attempting to choose among the many different methods. It

important to note that many of the methods can be combined, thus greatly increasing 
the palette of techniques from which to choose.

118	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
is important to note that the ECI may be singular and thus may not have an 
inverse. Obviously, for the full-DoF known-covariance case, RI
eff = R–1.
5.2	 Data-Independent Reduced-Rank STAP
The first branch point in the STAP taxonomy of Figure 5.1 differentiates 
between RLT and structured-covariance (model-based) methods. An RLT is 
either data-independent (nonadaptive) or data-dependent (adaptive) and can 
be thought of as a nonsquare matrix transformation (with more columns than 
rows) applied to the concatenated space-time snapshot data vectors (column 
vectors).
The most extreme example of a data-independent RLT is the so-called 
factored approach that consists of nonadaptive Doppler filtering and beam-
forming. Since there is no joint space-time (or joint angle-Doppler) process-
ing, this technique is also referred to as 1-D factored space-time processing 
[1, 2]. This method is extremely suboptimal for airborne radar in the presence 
of ground clutter since it makes no provision for the Doppler dependency on 
angle as described in Chapter 3. Succinctly stated, this method is mathemati-
cally tantamount to simply w = s, which clearly shows the complete lack of 
interference structure (i.e., interference covariance). Figure 5.2 shows the 
extreme suboptimality of this approach and serves as a reminder of why STAP 
for clutter cancellation was invented in the first place.
5.2.1  Pre-Doppler (Signal-Independent) Reduced-Rank STAP: DPCA 
and Adaptive DPCA
The first practical step, both historically and pedagogically, towards joint space-
time processing is the DPCA method [1]. Taxonomically, it is a pre-Doppler 
data-independent RLT. The DPCA method attempts to operate a ULA in 
such a manner that (1) the elements (or subarrays) of the ULA are extremely 
well matched (just how well will be discussed momentarily); (2) the axis of 
the ULA is aligned with the ground-track velocity vector (not necessarily the 
aircraft orientation due to crabbing); (3) the PRI is precisely chosen to insure 
that the array advances one interelement spacing per pulse; and (4) the trailing 
and leading elements are blanked on receive, as shown in Figure 5.3, which 
makes the indicated subarray appear stationary relative to the ground. If all 
four of these steps are performed to requisite tolerances, the ground clutter 
will appear stationary (without ICM, and so forth), thus vastly simplifying 
the clutter-cancellation process—at the cost of aperture efficiency.

above, the array appears to be stationary relative to the ground, vastly simplifying the 
clutter-cancellation process.

More precisely, consider the N-dimensional DPCA ULA “snapshot” 
returns from two successive pulses, x1 and x2, with a corresponding concat-
enated two-pulse space-time data vector x′ = [x′1  x′2]. Since the clutter will 
appear to be stationary (i.e., no Doppler shift), simply subtracting the returns 
from the two pulses should suffice in cancelling ground clutter [1, 2]. If we 
assume that we are interested in returns emanating from boresight (0°, that 
is, side-looking), then mathematically the entire two-pulse MTI DPCA can-
celler is equivalent to

Equation (5.4) is worthy of further examination. It is left as an exercise 
for the reader to prove equivalence between (5.4) and (5.2) (i.e., that the weight 
vectors are identical, which can be accomplished by comparing both vectors 
on an element basis—see Problems at end of this chapter). The implied space-
time steering vector for the two-pulse DPCA system is

This corresponds to a sidelooking (boresight-aligned) spatial steering vector 
[second vector in (5.5)] and a Doppler steering vector of [1  −1]′—which in 
turn corresponds to a simple two-pulse MTI canceller [8]. Since there are 
only two pulses being processed for clutter cancellation and since clutter in a 
perfect DPCA system occupies the Doppler space corresponding to dc (0 Hz), 
the only Doppler space left for signal detection is that which is orthogonal 
to [1  1]′, namely [1  −1]′. Further inspection of (5.4) reveals the effective 
matrix inverse for two-pulse DPCA

which is recognized to be a projection operator [9] that eliminates the 2-D 
subspace spanned by the Euclidean basis vectors e1, e2N. This is the operator 
responsible for alternately shutting off the leading and trailing elements on 
the first and second pulse, respectively.
Comparing (5.6) with the eigen-based form for the inverse of the covari-
ance [see (2.59)] implies that for an ideal two-pulse DPCA system, the clut-
ter rank after the DPCA operation is only two—regardless of the number of 
antenna elements. If the antenna were not operated in this DPCA fashion, 
Brennan’s rule would set the clutter rank at N + β(M − 1) = N +1, since β = 
1 and M = 2. This apparent violation of Brennan’s rule can be explained by 
the fact that it is only applicable to a linear time-invariant (LTI) space-time 
ULA. A DPCA antenna is time-varying (since the array manifold is different 
on each pulse) and is thus not covered by Brennan’s rule.
Before we analyze the performance of DPCA, we need to extend it to 
the processing of an entire STAP CPI, that is, more than just two pulses. This 
is easily accomplished by simply Doppler filtering the scalar (but complex) 
outputs from the two-pulse DPCA MTI filter as shown in Figure 5.4. The 
scalar outputs from the MTI canceller, yi, that are the inputs to the Doppler

where 0′ is an N-dimensional row vector, and the DPCA weight vectors w1 
and w2 are given by (5.2). Thus, the original space-time data has been trans-
formed into a clutter-whitened space spanned by y. For two-pulse DPCA, 
the dimension of y is M − 1, as indicated by the index subscript in (5.7). This 
corresponds roughly to a factor of N rank reduction.
The final stage of filtering is thus accomplished by matched filtering in 
this transformed space to a steering vector of interest. If we are interested in 
detecting a signal with original NM-dimensional space-time steering vector 
s, the corresponding steering vector in the transformed space is sy = Ωs. We 
are now in a position to state explicitly what the equivalent NM-dimensional 
space-time weight vector is (along with its ECI) for a two-pulse DPCA fol-
lowed by Doppler filtering. This is accomplished by working backwards from 
the final scalar output of the DPCA filtered CPI; that is,

Figure 5.5 displays the ideal performance for both full-DoF STAP and 
DPCA for an N = M = 16 sidelooking ULA example. Also shown is the per-
formance of DPCA when errors are present, namely, simple channel-mismatch 
errors (5° rms phase) and/or PRI mismatch (which is equivalent to β ≠ 1). 
The loss can be as much as 20 dB or more, especially for lower Doppler shifts.
As we demonstrated in Chapters 2 and 4, adaptive processing can be 
robust to certain channel-mismatch errors. Thus, it is natural to introduce 
adaptivity into the DPCA process and hopefully restore performance in the 
presence of channel mismatch and allow for operation when β ≠ 1. Adaptive 
DPCA (ADPCA) replaces the nonadaptive DPCA MTI canceller weight vec-
tor in (5.2) with an adaptive one, namely,

where R is the 2N × 2N interference covariance matrix associated with two 
successive array snapshots (i.e., two pulses). This two-pulse ADPCA canceller 
is then followed by Doppler filtering in precisely the same manner as DPCA 
(see Figure 5.4). Indeed, ADPCA has a similar mathematical structure to 
DPCA, namely,
	
wADPCA = Ω′Ωs = RI

where s is the full-DoF steering vector, and, in contrast to DPCA, Ω is com-
prised of the adaptive weights from (5.11).

Although we have only considered two pulses in the clutter-rejection 
filter, the form of (5.16) is the same for an arbitrary number of pulses in the 
first MTI stage with a suitable modification of (5.14). For example, three-pulse

However, when the number of pulses equals the entire CPI (i.e., M), ADPCA 
becomes equivalent to full-DoF STAP and can thus no longer be considered 
a rank-reducing linear transformation.
Figure 5.6 demonstrates the potential of ADPCA to retain performance 
in the presence of both channel-mismatch and nonunity β conditions. Of

course, a sample covariance is required in practice, and this can reduce the 
effectiveness of ADPCA from what is shown (although all STAP techniques 
must work with sample statistics). However, we will defer these considerations 
for the moment and will revisit them later in this chapter when a comparison 
can be drawn with other STAP techniques.
5.2.2  Post-Doppler (Signal-Dependent) Reduced-Rank STAP
Post-Doppler rank-reducing methods apply adaptivity after Doppler filter-
ing has first been applied. The primary rationale for this is the spatial (angle) 
dependency of clutter Doppler as described in Chapter 3. This Doppler sub-
banding approach typically allows for significantly smaller (reduced-rank) 
adaptivity, with a commensurate reduction in sample support and implemen-
tation requirements [1, 2, 5].
The simplest form of post-Doppler rank reduction is the single-bin 
method, which transforms an NM-dimensional space-time filtering problem 
into (typically) M separate N-dimensional spatial-only adaptive beamform-
ing problems as shown in Figure 5.7. Mathematically, the first 1-D Doppler 
filtering stage can be represented by

Rank reduction is achieved by solving a different spatial-only adaptive 
beamforming problem for each of the M Doppler bins. Thus, M different N 
× N adaptive problems are solved in contrast to M different NM × NM full-
DoF STAP problems (assuming a single look direction and M Doppler bins), 
which can be a dramatic computational savings.

where Rymym is the N × N (spatial-only) covariance matrix for the mth Dop-
pler bin, and sym = Ωms, that is, the steering vector corresponding to the full 
dimensional s in the reduced rank subspace (mth Doppler filter). Note that 
the Doppler frequency selected in the full dimensional s does not necessarily 
have to agree exactly with that implied by Ωm. For example, if the cost associ-
ated with estimating Rymym is high, one may use a coarse Doppler grid (i.e., M 
subbands) for Rymym, even though many more Doppler bins may be processed.

that the effective inverse in (5.21) is dependent on the desired Doppler (signal), 
in contrast to the signal-independent effective inverse for ADPCA in (5.16).
As will shortly be made apparent, so-called single-bin post-Doppler STAP 
performance is usually poor for most applications. A much better approach 
is to apply space-time adaptivity to two or more Doppler bins. For example, 
the effective matrix inverse for three-bin (adjacent bins on either side of the 
bin of interest) post-Doppler STAP is

Note that, similarly to multipulse ADPCA, in the limit, as the number of bins 
processed equals M, full-DoF STAP is realized—and thus no rank reduction 
is achieved.

Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
Figure 5.8 demonstrates the performance of single-bin post-Doppler 
STAP for several different tapering levels. The need for a heavy Doppler taper 
is particularly acute in the single-bin approach since mainbeam clutter can 
leak through the Doppler sidelobes (nominally a sinc response). This prob-
lem is significantly alleviated by the multibin approach (see Figure 5.9) at the 
expense of a substantially increased computational burden.
5.2.3  Other Rank-Reducing Linear Transformations
As will become apparent throughout this chapter, there are many combina-
tions and variations possible in designing a STAP algorithm—indeed too 
many to address adequately in any one source. Nonetheless, our objective in 
this chapter is to “span the space” of salient methods in sufficient detail as to 
allow the reader to design his or her own tailored solution.
An example of a natural extension to the above pre-and post-Doppler 
techniques is the so-called beamspace method [1, 5]. In this approach NB 
beams are first formed from the N antenna elements (either with phase shifts

for heavy Doppler tapering and the presence of significant loss in the mainbeam clutter 
region.

or time delays [10]), such that NB < N. The beams are then substituted for the 
ULA outputs. Beamspace rank reduction can be represented by a linear NB 
× N matrix operator, B, applied to each spatial-only array snapshot xi, whose 
output, xBi, is given by
	
xBi = Bxi	
(5.24)
where to be of value as an RLT, dim(xBi) < dim(xi) = N. The corresponding

Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
Due to the linear nature of beamspace rank reduction, other rank-reduc-
ing methods (e.g., DPCA, post-Doppler) can be extended to include beamspace 
via a composite linear operator. For example, the effective covariance inverse 
for single-bin post-Doppler modified to include beamspace rank reduction, 
has the general form
	
Rmeff
I
= BST¢ Ωm¢ ΩmBST RBST¢ Ωm¢
(
)
−1
ΩmBST 	
(5.26)
where it is understood that since the beamspace rank-reduction operator is 
applied first, the dimensions of Ωm are now given by NB × NBM instead of 
N × NM, as was the case for the element space formulation. It is also tacitly 
assumed in (5.26) that the beams are linearly independent [10], thus insuring 
that the indicated inverse exists. The reader is encouraged to derive similar 
expressions for the ADPCA expression in (5.16) and the multibin post-Doppler 
approach, along with a dimensional analysis of the constituent matrices (see 
Problem set at the end of this chapter).
If the competing clutter of concern is of limited spatial extent and its AoA 
is generally known a priori, a substantially reduced number of beams could be 
substituted for the N omnibeams. An example of such an approach for ground 
clutter cancellation is the point beams at clutter (PBC) approach [11]. In one 
potential manifestation of this approach, separate beams are formed for each 
Doppler bin (based on the angle-Doppler relationship described in Chapter 3) 
and then adaptively combined in either a single or multibin approach. However, 
this approach requires precise knowledge of ownship orientation and velocity 
along with terrain characteristics to maximize beamspace rank reduction.
Although an indispensable tool for rank reduction in practice (particu-
larly at higher frequencies), we will not explicitly include beamspace methods 
in the examples considered in this chapter because their efficacy is extremely 
dependent on specific implementation details. For example, poor sidelobe 
control can lead to interference leakage. Also, beam-pointing errors can have 
a significant deleterious effect. Nonetheless, it is easily accommodated as 
described above and can thus be readily incorporated into any analyses or 
examples considered in this book.
One last reduced-rank method worthy of discussion is the so-called 
PRI-staggered [1, 2] method of rank reduction, which is in some sense a 
cross between time-domain (e.g., ADPCA) and Doppler-domain approaches. 
Similar to post-Doppler methods, a rank-reducing linear transformation is 
performed that subbands the full-DoF space-time CPI into distinct Doppler 
bins. However, unlike the previously discussed single or multibin post-Doppler 

	
STAP for Radar: Methods, Algorithms, and Performance
133
methods, a single Doppler bin is formed from multiple-PRI-staggered windows 
or sub-CPI segments. For example, the rank-reducing transformation, 2Ψm, 
for the mth Doppler bin, two-PRI-staggered case, is given by
	
2Ψm =
f ¢m1 ⊗I N ×N
0N ×N
0N ×N
f ¢m2 ⊗I N ×N
⎡
⎣

where 2Ψm is a 2N × NM matrix, and fm1, fm2 are both M − 1 dimensional vec-
tors comprised of the first and last M − 1 elements, respectively, of fm defined 
in (5.19). Thus, the effective inverse for the two-PRI-staggered case is given by
	
Reff
I = 2Ψm¢

Again the reader is encouraged to extend (5.27) to the three-PRI-staggered 
(or higher) case.
The performance of the PRI-staggered approach is similar to that achieved 
by the multibin post-Doppler approach for like adaptive dimensionality (e.g., 
the three-bin post-Doppler and the three-PRI-staggered approaches have the 
same size reduced-dimension covariance matrices, and thus to first order, also 
have similar complexity).
5.3	 Data-Dependent Reduced-Rank STAP
Recently, to achieve even more efficient use of the available adaptive DoFs in 
a STAP beamformer, advanced methods of rank reduction have been devel-
oped whose exact behavior is dependent on the received data (generally sample 
statistics associated with the incoming data)—in other words adaptive rank 
reduction [12]. Indeed, we have already encountered one of the more popular 
methods in Chapter 2, namely principal components (PCs). Analogous to the 
deterministic or data-independent case, these methods also can be delineated 
into signal-dependent or -independent categories, which is to say, the rank-
reduction method may or may not (respectively) choose its reduced-rank 
subspace based on the particular steering vector of interest (see the taxonomy 
of Figure 5.1).
Another subtle, yet important, discriminant is whether the space-time 
snapshot that is being interrogated for the presence of targets is included in 

134	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
the data-dependent rank reduction. For example, the PC method performs 
(directly or indirectly) an eigendecomposition of a sample covariance matrix 
(as was the case in Chapter 2). If the sample covariance was computed without 
the current resolution-cell-under-test data, then the PC method is still a linear 
transformation, because it is tantamount to a linear matrix transformation 
(nonsquare) whose elements are independent of the data being transformed 
(see below).
If, on the other hand, the sample covariance was computed with the 
current resolution-cell-under-test data (along with other cells in general), then 
technically this is a nonlinear rank-reduction method. A nonlinear opera-
tion can be a significant complicating factor if not carefully controlled and 
understood. Nonlinearities can introduce spurious false targets (violation 
of linear superposition) and can transform the statistics of the interference 
data. For example, the application of a nonlinear transformation to a Gauss-
ian stochastic process results in a generally non-Gaussian output, which can 
significantly impact the design of the detector (e.g., CFAR detector) [13]. 
However, reasons to include the cell under test, despite these concerns, might 
be to detect the presence of discretes (i.e., strong interferers that only exist in 
a single resolution cell [11]), or if there is a scarcity of representative training 
data due to extreme nonstationarity [14]. Methods have been developed that 
allow for the inclusion of the test cell in the training data without significantly 
altering the linear behavior of the filter. One such method is the eigencanceler 
and its variants [15].
Section 5.3.1 will examine the signal-independent variants of the data-
dependent rank-reduction methods. These methods choose a linear subspace 
solely on the basis of the training data and not on what particular steering 
vector will be applied for filtering. In contrast, Section 5.3.2 will introduce 
signal-dependent methods. Again, we emphasize that these methods can be 
combined with the deterministic rank-reducing methods previously described. 
This fact will be illustrated later on in this chapter.
5.3.1  Signal-Independent Methods
The most fundamental and important method in the signal-independent 
(data-dependent) category is principal components. Here, the rank-ordering 
metric (ROM) is simply the expected energy, or variance, along an eigenvector 
dimension of the interference covariance matrix (sample or ideal). Rank reduc-
tion is achieved by truncating the eigen-based expansion of the covariance. 
For an illustration of this process, consider Figure 5.10, which shows a block 
diagram for the Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) analysis filter bank [16, 17].

	
STAP for Radar: Methods, Algorithms, and Performance
135
The input NM-dimensional random-vector process (space-time array 
output) is projected onto an orthonormal basis in which the ROM is the 
variance along an eigenvector dimension. Thus, for example, at the first stage 
u1 (an NM-dimensional vector) is chosen to maximize the objective function 
J given by
	
J = E u1¢x
2
⎛
⎝⎜
⎞
⎠⎟= u1¢Ru1
Subject to: u1¢u1 = 1
	
(5.29)
Since R is positive-semidefinite, J is a quadratic form and convex func-
tional [18]. Thus, a necessary and sufficient condition for a maximum is that 
the vector derivative of the Lagrange multiplier augmented objective function 
vanish; that is,
	
d

u1¢Ru1 −l1 u1¢u1 −1
(

(
) = 2 Ru1 −l1u1
(
) = 0NM ×1 	
(5.30)

PC methods. The ROM is simply the expected value of the energy (or variance) at each 
stage. Rank reduction is achieved by truncating the analysis tree.

where λ 1 is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the unit norm constraint 
in (5.29) [18]. The result is an eigenvalue/vector problem of the form
	
Ru1 = λ 1u1	
(5.31)
which for a positive-definite R is known to have exactly NM solutions (not all 
necessarily corresponding to distinct eigenvalues [16]). Thus, at the first stage, 
we choose that solution u1 which corresponds to a maximum eigenvalue λ 1. 
Note that λ 1 is also the variance of y1, that is, the variance of the output of 
the first stage of the KLT analysis tree:
	
E y1

(
) = E u1¢x

⎛
⎝⎜
⎞
⎠⎟
= u1¢Ru1
= l1u1¢u1
= l1
	
(5.32)
where (5.31) and the unity norm constraint were invoked in the second and 
third steps, respectively, of (5.32).
Except for the case when no clutter is present (and at most only one rank-
one jammer), a 1-D subspace is inadequate for representing the colored-noise 
process. Consequently, the above procedure is repeated for k stages, where for 
rank-reduction k < NM (typically k << NM).
Referring to Figure 5.10, we see that the second stage of the KLT consists 
of selecting that second orthonormal basis vector (eigenvector) u2 such that
	
max
u2
u2¢R1u2
Subject to: u2¢u2 = 1
	
(5.33)
where

(5.34)

137
Thus, R1 is the covariance (positive-semidefinite, even if R was full-rank) 
associated with the subspace that is orthogonal to u1 since B1 is a projection 
operator that effectively removes the u1 subspace [16].
The mathematical procedure for finding u2 is identical to that for find-
ing u1. The solution is again that eigenvector that maximizes the eigenvalue 
λ 2 associated with
	
R1u2 = λ 2u2	
(5.35)
Principal components rank reduction is achieved by truncating the 
above procedure at k stages where k < NM. To be useful, however, k should 
be << NM. Recall that for the jammer-only case considered in Chapter 2, 
the number of independent jammers, NJ, was shown to be equal to the rank 
of the colored-noise covariance matrix. Moreover, NJ < N, and thus only a 
few eigenvectors were required to form the adaptive weights. Resulting in a 
well-behaved adapted pattern and commensurately reduced sample support.
For the clutter case (or clutter-plus-jamming case), Brennan’s rule estab-
lishes a lower bound for the clutter rank and can thus be used to aid in the 
selection of a practical stopping rule. However, as was detailed in Chapter 4, 
Brennan’s rule may significantly underestimate the true clutter rank due to a 
multitude of important factors (e.g., crabbing, nonlinear arrays, ISL, and other 
decorrelating effects). This can lead to significantly suboptimal performance 
and/or a loss of the desirable minimal sample support property. However, a 
method for extending the PC method in the presence of ISL is considered in 
Section 5.4.
As derived in Chapter 2, the effective covariance inverse for the rank-k 
PC method is

which is a projection matrix [16]; that is, (RI
eff)2 = RI
eff (which is left as an exer-
cise for the reader to verify). In this case, the PC method projects the data out 
of the subspace spanned by the k dominant eigenvectors.

138	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
Figure 5.11 shows the performance of the PC method relative to both 
the straight SMI and diagonally loaded SMI. In this example, Brennan’s rule 
holds (ideal case) and the PC method can produce results with only 62 train-
ing samples that SMI can only achieve with 2NM or 512 samples. However, 
as detailed in Chapter 2, the proper choice of diagonal loading can approxi-
mate the PC method.
As discussed in Chapter 4 (and elsewhere [1, 2, 4]), Brennan’s rule never 
strictly holds in practice due to a multitude of potential rank-increasing effects. 
As a consequence, PC methods lose their appeal in practical applications 
as they require the inclusion of more subdominant eigenvalues to account 
for the additional interference subspaces. For example, in Figure 5.12, the 
same example is repeated, but with the inclusion of ICM. If Brennan’s rule is 
employed as a PC rank-selection criterion, it will result in significant SINR 
loss. This can be alleviated by including more components, but at the expense 
Figure 5.11  Performance of the PC method for an ideal ULA for which Brennan’s rule 
holds. The efficiency of the PC method results in a substantial reduction in sample 
support requirements compared with the SMI method. Note that a properly loaded SMI 
(10 dB in this case) achieves similar performance since it mathematically approximates 
the PC method for this case (see Chapter 2 for an explanation of this effect).

of a commensurately increased sample support (and computational burden). A 
method of extending the PC approach to more realistic environments—with-
out increasing the requisite sample support—will be discussed in Section 5.4.
Another less-known, signal-independent, rank-reduction method some-
what related to principal components, is the Hung-Turner projection [19]. 
This method has the form
	
RI
eff = I − YY′	
(5.38)
where
	
Y = [x1  x2  …  xL ]	
(5.39)
is a NM × L, L << NM, matrix comprised of space-time array snapshots (i.i.d. 
training data) generally selected from surrounding range-bins. If the colored-
noise interference is both strong (relative to the noise floor) and low rank (i.e., 
k << NM), then the PC method can be approximated by (5.38) if L ≈ k [19]. 
Figure 5.12  Impact when interference subspace leakage (10 mph ICM) is present. 
Note that for this case, Brennan’s rule is not a good choice for rank selection. A method 
for addressing this problem is described in Section 5.4.

140	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
This is because k i.i.d. samples will, in the limit as CNR → ∞, exactly span 
the k-dimensional colored-noise subspace (almost surely [20]). Hence, project-
ing orthogonal to that subspace [i.e., (5.38)] will result in an optimum filter. 
Zatman has analyzed the optimum choice of L for finite CNR [19].
Although not generally considered a robust practical technique, it is rela-
tively simple to implement (no need to perform an eigendecomposition) and, 
for the dominant low-rank colored-noise case, can yield essentially equivalent 
performance as PC (i.e., same SINR for properly selected training data)—
hence its appeal. The reader is encouraged to experiment with this technique 
and compare it to PC. However, for the reasons previously cited, we will not 
consider it further in this book.
5.3.2  Signal-Dependent Methods
As was the case for the data-independent rank-reducing methods, the main 
reason for considering signal-dependency in the rank-reduction process is to 
make more efficient use of the available adaptive DoFs. Post-Doppler methods 
(an example of a signal-dependent data-independent rank-reduction method) 
solved a different adaptive problem for each Doppler bin of interest, in contrast 
to ADPCA, which solved only one adaptive clutter-cancellation problem for 
all Doppler. If the number of signals (i.e., steering vectors) is large, signal-
dependent methods can have dramatically greater overall computational bur-
dens. However, they also enjoy a high degree of parallelism since in most cases 
the signal-dependent solutions can be derived independently of each other. 
However, this feature can only be exploited if a large number of parallel CPUs 
is available in the real-time signal processor.
Perhaps the most straightforward method for introducing signal depen-
dency (i.e., steering-vector-specific dependency) into the subspace selection 
process is to modify the ROM of principal components. For example, the 
standard signal-independent ROM for PC is simply the strength of the eigen-
value. There are several relatively straightforward methods for modifying the 
ROM to include a desired steering vector [12].
5.3.2.1  Relative Importance of Eigenbeam Method
One method is based on examining the amount of influence a particular eigen-
vector has on the weight vector associated with a particular steering-vector 
solution. For example, recall from Chapter 2 the expression for the optimum 
weight vector expressed in terms of the eigenvalues/vectors of the interference 
covariance matrix; that is,

(5.40)
An examination of (5.40) revels a natural choice of ROM; namely
	
max
{i}
li −lmin
li
ui¢s 	
(5.41)
Thus, for example, {λ̃ 1, ũ 1} is the eigenvalue-eigenvector pair that maximizes 
(5.41), which may or may not correspond to the PC ROM; that is, {λ 1, u1}. 
Assuming, without loss of generality, that s′s = u′iui = 1, (5.41) represents the 
normalized amplitude of the eigenbeam (i.e., ui) subtracted from s. For con-
venience, we will refer to (5.41) as the relative importance of eigenbeam, or 
RIE, metric of rank ordering.
There are three ways in which the metric in (5.41) could be zero: (1) 
λ i = λ min, which implies (in practice) that the eigenvalue is equal to the 
white-noise floor and thus should not be subtracted (recall that the optimum 
filter for the white-noise case is w = s); (2) ⎪u′is⎪ = 0, which implies that ui 
is orthogonal to s and can thus be ignored (regardless of the strength of the 
eigenvalue); and (3) both conditions are met. In practice, one should be very 
careful about condition 2, since errors in the assumed steering vector can cause 
erroneous results. A remedy is to place a lower bound on ⎪u′is⎪ to insure that 
it is not completely ignored (a natural choice is to set the lower bound equal 
to the expected steering-vector mismatch residue error). Indeed, sensitivity 
to steering-vector mismatches is a serious concern in all signal-dependent 
reduced-rank methods.
From (5.40) and (5.41), it follows that the ECI for the relative importance 
of eigenbeam (RIE) method is

where {λ̃ 1, ũ 1} denotes the eigenvalue-eigenvector pair that ranked in the ith 
position based on the RIE rank-ordering metric. Thus, in general, λ̃ 1 ≠ λ i 

142	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
(although this is entirely possible). Again for meaningful rank reduction, it is 
tacitly assumed that k << NM.
5.3.2.2  Cross Spectral Metric
Another technique for modifying the PC approach to include signal depen-
dency is based on viewing the STAP problem from a sidelobe canceller (SLC) 
perspective [21]. From Figure 5.13, we see that the space-time filtering prob-
lem can reformulated from a max SINR problem (which is the framework 
adopted so far in this book) to a minimum variance estimation problem [21]. 
Specifically, the objective is to choose the auxiliary space-time weight vector 
w0 [which is of dimension (NM − 1) × 1)] so as to minimize the scalar MSE; 
that is,
	
min
w0
E d0 −ˆd0
2
⎛
⎝
⎞
⎠	
(5.43)
Since ˆd0  is a linear estimator, a necessary and sufficient condition for mini-
mizing the quadratic convex functional (5.43) is setting its vector derivative 
equal to zero (on an element basis):

which yields
	
w0 = Rx0x0
−1 rx0d0 	
(5.45)
where
	
Rx0x0 = B0RB′0	
(5.46)
is the (NM − 1) × (NM − 1) covariance matrix associated with the auxiliary 
data x0 and
	
rx0d0 = B0Rs	
(5.47)
is the (NM − 1) × 1 cross-correlation matrix (actually a vector). B is a (NM − 1) 
× (NM) blocking [21] or null [10] matrix whose (NM − 1) rows are orthonormal 
to s, the desired steering vector (also referred to as the mainbeam response [21]).
To obtain the form of the effective covariance inverse for the SLC for-
mulation, we again examine the output and work back as follows:
	
z = s¢x −w0¢ B0x
= s¢x −w0¢ B0
(

(5.49)
and thus

I = I −B0Rx0x0

(5.50)
While seemingly a different approach than the max SINR method, the 
above SLC formulation is equivalent and yields identical output SINR. One 
way to see this is first to observe that the output from the mainbeam channel 
(scalar) concatenated with the (NM − 1) outputs from the auxiliary channels 

144

formed by the (NM − 1) × 1 blocking matrix is the result of applying an NM 
× NM unitary (and thus invertible) matrix Q given by

⎡
⎣⎢

(5.51)
The unitary property of Q is easily established since, by definition, the rows 
of B are pairwise orthonormal and orthonormal to s (and, without loss of 
generality, we can assume s′s = 1). Since the application of a unitary matrix 
does not alter the SINR [21], a completely equivalent (and optimal from a

Note that only B1 needed to be computed in (5.53) to obtain the SINR.
Again, (5.53) is the max SINR for the transformed (via Q) colored-noise 
matched filter, which is also equal to the original optimum SINR, s′R–1s, since 
a unitary transformation cannot alter the SINR. Showing that this is also the 
SINR corresponding to the minimum MSE SLC is straightforward. From an

orthogonality between s and the rows of B0 was invoked to eliminate the cross 
terms in line four of the above proof.
The cross-spectral metric (CSM) rank-ordering metric as developed in [22] 
is a method for prioritizing the eigenvalues/vectors of the covariance matrix 
associated with the auxiliary channels. This is first accomplished by express-
ing the SINR in terms of these eigenvalues; that is,

tion based on the CSM. For effective rank reduction, it is again assumed that

5.3.2.3  Multistage Wiener Filter
The above signal-dependent methods (RIE and CSM) for modifying the 
data-dependent PC method are relatively straightforward methods for modi-
fying the basis selected for rank reduction. However, both methods utilize 
an existing basis (eigenvectors of R or Rx0x0) that was developed without any 
knowledge of s. An entirely different method for selecting a useful basis that 
explicitly takes s into account was developed by Goldstein et al. and is referred 
to as the multistage Wiener filter (MWF) [23].
To see how the MWF selects suitable basis vectors, consider the first stage 
depicted in Figure 5.14. The objective is to choose a rank-one NM − 1 dimen-
sional basis vector, h1, that is useful for minimizing the MSE. The optimal 
choice for h1 is, of course, the minimum MSE weight vector w0 given by (5.45). 
But this solution requires knowledge of the full covariance matrix Rx0x0, and 

148	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
is thus counter to the objective of rank reduction. We thus seek a basis vector 
that is useful for estimating d0, but does not require full knowledge of Rx0x0.
One candidate, which is the rationale of the MWF, is to choose that 
rank-one basis vector h1 such that the cross-correlation energy between d1 = 
h′1x0 and d0 is maximized [12]; that is,

Since (5.65) is the magnitude squared of an inner product, a direct application 
of Schwarz’s inequality yields the optimum h1, namely,
	
h1 =
rx0d0
rx0d0
	
(5.66)
where a unity norm constraint was imposed on the basis vector h1; that is, 
‖h1‖ = (h′1h1)1/2 = 1. Note that as desired, (5.66) does not depend directly 
on Rx0x0. Equation (5.66) is an intuitively appealing result: Set h1 equal to 
the cross correlation between x0 and d0. With this choice of h1, the optimal 
rank-one MWF (scalar) weight vector w1 is given by
	
w1 = Rd1d1
−1 rd1d0

where σ d0d0 is the cross correlation between d1 and d0, and sd1
2  is the vari-
ance of d1.
Since h1 is not in general colinear with the optimal Wiener vector w0 (as 
this requires the full covariance and cross-correlation information), additional 
basis vectors will be required to adequately span the colored-noise subspace 
that is interfering with the mainbeam response d0. To remedy this, we can add 
more stages to the above process—hence the meaning of “multistage” in MWF.
Figure 5.15 shows a two-stage (rank-two) MWF. The space spanned by 
x1 can be seen to be orthogonal to span(s, h1) due to the blocking matrices 
B0 and B1. Our objective at this stage is to choose a basis vector h2, which, 
reapplying the criterion from the first stage, is maximally correlated with the 
coefficient from the first stage d1, [12, 23], that is,

The corresponding optimal SLC weight for the two-stage MWF is thus

Recently, Weippert et al. [24] have shown the relationship between the above 
sequential decomposition and the method of conjugate gradients. This observa-
tion is of more than just theoretical interest since many previously established 
convergence analyses can be readily adapted to the special MWF case [24].
5.3.3  Comparison of Data-Dependent Rank-Reduction Methods
Before applying these methods to the STAP problem, we will examine the 
relative rank-compression performance of the data-dependent methods for the 
1-D beamforming example first considered in Chapter 2. This simple illustra-
tion will aid in understanding the differences between the various methods 
without extraneous complications. Section 5.5 will illustrate application of 
these methods to STAP.
Figure 5.16 shows the SINR performance for the six-jammer example 
of Figure 2.4 as a function of the rank k of the adaptive beamformer (num-
ber of principal components or MWF stages) for each of the data-dependent 
reduced-rank methods. Figure 5.16(a) is for the ideal case (exact covariance); 
Figure 5.16(a) shows the finite sample case (2k samples, where k is the jam-
mer rank). Note that in the ideal case, the MWF enjoys a significant rank-
compression advantage over the other methods. However, this advantage is 
essentially removed when a finite amount of training data is available. In fact, 
all six basis vectors are required to achieve good nulling performance—exactly 

152

covariance case, and (b) finite sample covariance case.

153
the rank required by the PC methods. This last behavior is due to the need 
to fully characterize the colored-noise subspace before an optimal choice of 
basis can be determined. This characterization is fundamentally limited by the 
amount of sample support (as well as the estimation procedure). The interested 
reader is referred to [12] for further details regarding SINR performance as a 
function of filter rank and sample support.
To gain further insight into how the MWF can achieve higher rank-
compression (for the known or large sample-support covariance case), consider 
the eigenbeam responses of Figure 5.17. Depicted is the PC response, along 
with the principal MWF response. Since PC is based strictly on energy and 
not the steering vector of interest (in this case broadside), it simply selects 
an eigenvector that is essentially aligned with the maximum jammer signal. 
In contrast, the MWF uses the shaping of the quiescent steering vector to 
select responses corresponding to jammers that have a greater influence, that 
is, stronger JNR after beamforming. Of course, if there are steering-vector 
mismatches, the efficiency of the MWF will be reduced. However, this effect 
is highly scenario-dependent, and it is difficult to make general statements 
regarding MWF robustness.
5.4	 Structured-Covariance and Model-Based Methods
Structured-covariance methods, also referred to sometimes as model-based 
methods, refer to techniques that explicitly incorporate specific mathemati-
cal constraints or structures into the covariance estimation process. Implicit 
constraints, such as Doppler or beamspace binning, are almost always pres-
ent in any MTI radar and are generally not considered explicit model-based 
methods. Instead, they can be considered data-independent/signal-dependent 
methods in accordance with the taxonomy of Figure 5.1.
One of the primary reasons for considering structured-covariance meth-
ods is their potential for significantly reducing sample-support requirements. 
This can be of considerable practical value in nonstationary environments 
where there may be a dearth of auxiliary data available for covariance estima-
tion (or weight training) [12].
Section 5.4.1 will consider a broadly applicable class of structured covari-
ance methods based on the observation that many realistic clutter/ interference 
scenarios involve a multitude of ISL phenomena, such as ICM, dispersion, and 
so on, as described in Chapter 4. In particular, a method that combines the 
CMT structure with either PC or diagonal loading will be explored. Due to

155
the ubiquitous nature of ISL, this class of methods enjoys particularly broad 
applicability [12].
Other model-based methods with far less broad applicability include 
Toeplitz and TBT [6, 7], forward-backward smoothing (FBS) [25, 26], and 
parametric multichannel signal modeling [27–29]. Due to their narrow scope, 
we will only briefly discuss their basic modeling assumptions in Section 5.4.2 
and provide references for the interested reader.
5.4.1  Covariance Matrix Tapers
As discussed in Chapter 4, many real-world phenomena give rise to a specific 
covariance structure involving a Hadamard-multiplicative matrix operation 
referred to as a CMT [30]. Specifically, the structure is of the form R ○ T, 
where R is the underlying space-time covariance matrix in the absence of any 
ISL or random modulation effects, and T is the generally composite CMT 
that accounts for all ISL effects.
To see how this CMT structure can be exploited to provide a more 
efficient covariance estimation process, consider the space-time eigenspec-
trum of our standard N = M = 16 ULA with and without ICM (see Figure 
5.18). Notice that the spectrum of the dominant eigenvalues (k = 31 for this 
example) appears essentially unaffected by the ICM. As discussed in Chapter 
4, ICM is well modeled as a CMT and only requires a few simple parameters 
to characterize (e.g., Billingsley’s model [31]). This suggests a hybrid estima-
tion approach in which the dominant eigenvalues/vectors are estimated in the 
usual manner using the PC method (with Brennan’s rule serving as a nominal 
stopping criterion), and then a final estimated covariance is obtained by apply-
ing a CMT and reestablishing the noise floor [4]; that is,
	
ˆRPC-CMT =
ˆliˆuiˆui¢
i=1
k
∑
⎛
⎝⎜
⎞
⎠⎟  ˆT + ˆsn

(5.80)
where the set of k eigenvalues/vectors { ˆli, ˆui}  is estimated in the normal 
manner (e.g., an SVD [9]) with the usual (e.g., 2k) sample support, ˆT  is the 
estimated CMT, and ˆsn
2  is the estimated noise floor. Before commenting 
on the methods for obtaining ˆT  and ˆsn
2,  a bit more justification for (5.80) 
is in order, other than just a simple visual examination of an eigenspectrum 
invariance. Note that the corresponding ECI for the PC-CMT of (5.80) is 
simply its inverse.

156	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
Consider the Karhunen-Loeve [21] representation of the unmodulated 
space-time clutter signal, which is based on a stochastic expansion of the 
clutter-only eigenvectors; that is,
	
xc =
g ciuci
i=1
k
∑
	
(5.81)
where xc is an NM-dimensional vector RV corresponding to the clutter-only 
signal in the absence of random modulation, uci is the ith eigenvector associ-
ated with the clutter-only covariance matrix (see Chapter 3), and the k complex 
scalars and mutually uncorrelated RVs {γ ci} have the property
	
E g cig cq
∗
(
) = lcidiq 	
(5.82)
where σ iq is the Kronecker delta function.

amounts of ISL. This property can be exploited by a structured-covariance estimation 
procedure that models the subdominant eigenvalues/vectors by a CMT.

157
As described in Chapter 4, the presence of a CMT implies that a vector 
random modulation t is present; that is,
	
xc   t =
g ciuci
i=1
k
∑
⎛

i=1

(5.83)
where the distributive property of Hadamard products has been invoked [9].
In practice, the amount of modulation is small; otherwise, the colored 
noise (clutter/jamming) would be effectively whitened, precluding the need 
for structured space-time filtering as a simple white-noise matched filter would 
suffice. Indeed, it is this characteristic of ISL that results in the seemingly 
unperturbed eigenvalues of Figure 5.18. To see this, we first explicitly invoke 
the small modulation approximation; namely
	
t ≈ 1 + ϵ	
(5.84)
where 1 is an NM-dimensional vector with unity entries, and ϵ is a zero-mean, 
NM-dimensional complex-valued vector RV such that E(‖ϵ‖) << 1. Substitut-
ing this approximation into (5.83) yields

uci   e
	
(5.85)
where the vector Hadamard identity property was invoked; that is, uci ○ 1 = uci. 
Equation (5.85) shows that the introduction of a small ISL modulation can be 
viewed as a small complex modulation of a large carrier signal (the eigenvec-
tors). From elementary communication systems theory [32], it is known that 
this will result in a large carrier (original eigenvectors) with small sideband 
signals (subdominant eigenvectors) due to the modulation.
The corresponding covariance matrix is given by [9]

(5.86)

158	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
where Rc = cov(xc), Rϵ = cov(ϵ), and δR = Rc ○ Rϵ. While by definition ‖δ R‖ 
<< 1, it is in general of full rank [9]. Thus, it can be decomposed as follows
	
dR = PcdRPc¢ + I −Pc
(
)dR I −Pc
(
)¢ 	
(5.87)
where Pc is an NM × NM projection matrix onto the subspace spanned by the 
k clutter eigenvectors, and, thus, I − Pc is the projection onto the orthogonal 
compliment [16]. Since, again by definition, ‖PcδRP′c‖ << 1, we see that the 
subspace spanned by Rc is essentially undisturbed—which explains our obser-
vations in Figure 5.18. The subdominant eigenvalues vectors introduced into 
the subspace orthogonal to the unmodulated clutter spectrum may or may 
not be of concern. As discussed in Chapter 4, these subdominant components 
only have an impact if their eigenvalues exceed the elemental noise floor (see 
the discussion on the iceberg effect in Chapter 4).
The preceding argument justifies the use of (5.80) under the conditions 
(normally encountered) of modest ISL. Thus, the indicated eigenvalues/ vec-
tors in (5.80) can be estimated in the usual manner with—and this is the 
important part—a sample support based on k, the nominal clutter rank (for 
which Brennan’s rule can be used as a guide). Of course, it is tacitly assumed 
that the CNR is high; otherwise, the effective rank of the clutter may be even 
less than that predicted by Brennan’s rule (and the subdominant eigenvalues 
due to ISL and so on are below the noise floor—and thus of no concern). The 
noise-floor estimate ˆsn
2  is easily obtained from routine calibration procedures 
and thus will not be further discussed. However, the choice of CMT ˆT  is a 
different matter.
There are a number of different ways in which ˆT  may be estimated, 
such as using knowledge of average channel-mismatch specifications, band-
width dispersion, array manifold calibration tables, and real-time equaliza-
tion procedures. Also, knowledge of the general clutter type and wind state 
can be used. However, since the presence of some form of space and/or time 
decorrelating mechanism is a virtual certainty, having some reasonable esti-
mate of ˆT  is far better than none at all. To illustrate this point, Figure 5.19 
compares a nominal PC method (rank = k) and several PC-CMT methods 
with varying degrees of CMT accuracy for a fixed sample support of 2k = 
62 (two times the Brennan rank). Even with imperfect knowledge of ˆT , the 
PC-CMT method consistently outperforms direct PC, as evidenced by the 
±5-mph mismatch cases in Figure 5.19.
Figure 5.19 also shows a diagonally loaded sample matrix method aug-
mented with a CMT. As described in Chapter 2, diagonal loading approximates 

	
STAP for Radar: Methods, Algorithms, and Performance
159
PC methods and can thus be used as a surrogate for the eigendecomposition 
indicated in (5.80). This can be of considerable practical implementation 
value since this SMI-CMT algorithm is amenable to conventional systolic 
array implementation (see Chapter 6). Specifically, the SMI-CMT estimator 
is of the form
	
ˆRSMI-CMT =
ˆRSMI
(
)  ˆT + dI 	
(5.88)
where ˆRSMI  is the usual sample matrix estimate (based on 2k samples, and 
thus generally positive-semidefinite), and δ is the loading factor [33]. Note 
that the effective covariance inverse is simply the inverse of (5.88).
Since ISL in its many forms is a ubiquitous real-world phenomenon, the 
CMT structure should likewise be widely adopted to account for subdomi-
nant interference. The above methods are merely two simple illustrations of 
how one might incorporate the CMT structured covariance. Many others will 
undoubtedly be developed. For example, a more formal estimation procedure 
might entail a composite joint MLE approach. However these approaches are 
Figure 5.19  Performance of the PC-CMT and SMI-CMT approaches in the presence of 
ICM. Note the robustness of mismatches in the CMT.

160	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
generally only efficient asymptotically [34] and thus might require significantly 
larger sample supports than the divide-and-conquer approach considered here.
5.4.2  Other Structured-Covariance Methods
Due to the ubiquitous presence of spatial and/or temporal decorrelating effects 
and channel mismatch, the above CMT structured-covariance methods are 
fairly general and are thus not overly constraining. Other structured-covariance 
methods have been suggested that are far more restrictive and, thus, less gen-
erally applicable. For example, from Section 3.2, under the assumptions of a 
perfectly matched ULA in the presence of mutually uncorrelated clutter point 
scatterers in the absence of antenna crabbing and any ISL, it can be deduced 
that the space-time covariance matrix of an ideal ULA with constant PRF 
has a TBT structure of the form [1]

which is an NM × NM block-Toeplitz matrix comprised of M, N × N block

where the entries are complex scalars. Thus, the space-time matrix is comprised 
of O(NM) distinct elements, dramatically reducing the number of unknowns 
from the general case that involves O(N2M2) unknowns. This implies that there 
exists significant potential for reducing sample-support requirements [6, 7].
Unfortunately, fitting a TBT matrix to sample data is a highly nonlinear 
process (see, for example, [6, 7], which discuss the MLE and EM approaches) 

	
STAP for Radar: Methods, Algorithms, and Performance
161
that involves iterative processes that are not guaranteed to converge—a sig-
nificant drawback for practical applications. Since the efficacy of this tech-
nique is tightly coupled to the specifics of any given application, it is difficult 
to draw any general conclusions regarding its utility. The interested reader is 
thus referred to the research literature for further details.
Another very closely related technique that applies under the same general 
ULA constraints cited for Toeplitz is the method of FBS [25, 26, 35]. Consider 
the linear flip-up-down-then-conjugate operator J(⋅): ℂNM → ℂNM, given by
	
J(x) = conj

(5.91)
It is straightforward to show that a linear phase Vandermonde steering vec-
tor, v, is, to within a complex scalar phase term, invariant to J(⋅), that is, J(v) 
= ejφv [25, 26]. However, if n is an NM-dimensional vector RV comprised of 
complex, zero-mean, and uncorrelated entries, then E(J(n)n′) = ∅. This sug-
gests that if the colored-noise portion of the total interference signal is a linear 
superposition of Vandermonde steering vectors, then additional data samples 
can be constructed whose white-noise components are uncorrelated. For the 
Gaussian case, this further implies that the extended samples have additive 
white noise that is independent of the original samples—thus effectively 
increasing the available sample support. Again, the efficacy of this technique 
in practice has been found to be extremely scenario-dependent, and it is thus 
not considered further in this text.
Another class of structured-covariance methods effectively reduces the 
number of independent dimensions of the full space-time stochastic process 
by imposing a vector autoregressive multichannel signal model [27–29]. For 
example, the output of the ULA can be thought of as a vector AR time series 
of the form
	
x(m + 1) = A(m)x(m) + v(m)	
(5.92)
where x(m) ∈ ℂN is the array snapshot vector associated with the mth pulse, 
and v(m) is assumed to be a white-noise vector RV, that is, E(v(m)v′(q)) = 
δ mqD, where D is a diagonal matrix. Thus, all of the correlation structure is 
contained in the state transition matrix A(m) ∈ ℂN×N (and the implied autore-
gressive structure). Although certainly a simplifying structural constraint, 
its effectiveness is also highly scenario-dependent and thus not amenable to 

162

generalizations. The interested reader should consult [27–29] and the refer-
ences cited therein for further details.
5.5	 Illustrative Design Examples
In this section, STAP design examples are presented that illustrate ways in 
which various reduced-rank STAP methods can be combined to yield good 
SINR performance, but with dramatically reduced sample-support (and com-
putational) requirements. Specifically, we consider both signal-independent 
(ADPCA with data-dependent CMT rank reduction) and signal-dependent 
(multibin post-Doppler with MWF rank reduction). Our motivation is simple: 
to minimize sample support to insure reliable performance and/or graceful 
degradation in nonstationary heterogeneous clutter environments. While this 
design process does not explicitly include real-time embedded computing 
constraints, they are indirectly, but significantly, alleviated due to the pres-
ence of a deterministic rank-reducing prestage transformation [1, 2]. Further 
discussions of real-time implementation issues and methods can be found in 
Chapter 6 (and references cited therein).
A somewhat stressing clutter scenario is chosen to magnify the impact of 
each of the design stages and to provide a better gauge of algorithm robustness. 
Figure 5.20 shows the full-DoF eigenspectrum for an N = M = 16 ULA with 
a CNR of 60 dB, β = 1, ICM of 15 mph, 5° rms of simple channel mismatch 
(rank-one CMT), 2° of crab with 40-dB back lobe rejection, and decorrelating 
channel mismatch (full-rank CMT) corresponding to ∆ϵ = 0.01, ∆φ = 1° (see 
Chapter 4). Note that the effective rank of the clutter (~ 100; see Chapter 4) 
is substantially greater than that predicted by Brennan’s rule, which for this 
example is 31.
At this stage, the reader might be wondering why we have chosen not to 
illustrate the design methods on real data. There are actually several reasons: 
First, there is a paucity of public-domain multichannel STAP data that is truly 
representative of diverse and complex clutter environments. Although some 
data does exist (e.g., [24, 36–39]), it is by no means enough to draw defini-
tive conclusions regarding the best algorithm for a given operating condition. 
Second, the reader may very well be interested in selecting a STAP algorithm 
for a radar configuration and operation that is dissimilar to the publicly avail-
able data. So rather than potentially bias the reader with information based 
on sparse experimentation, this book has opted to develop the salient con-
stitutive signal and system models that allow for the exploration of countless

163
scenarios—thereby affording the reader the ability to build a comprehensive 
experience base.
5.5.1  Signal-Independent Approach
Our first design step is the choice of a data-independent (deterministic) rank-
reducing transformation. Even at this stage, there is a significant number of 
options available, including beamspace versus element space, and pre-Doppler 
(PRI space) versus post-Doppler. As beamspace is usually indicated when there 
is a large number of independent receive elements or when severe implementa-
tion constraints exist, we will not consider it in this particular design example. 
We are therefore left with a choice of pre-or post-Doppler.
Figure 5.21 shows the ideal SINR loss curves for the full-DoF optimum, 
three-pulse ADPCA, and three-bin post-Doppler cases. While both reduced-
rank methods perform well, the post-Doppler method involves substantially 
greater overall computations since a different adaptive problem must be solved 
Figure 5.20  Eigenspectrum for the design example involving both strong clutter and a 
multitude of real-world deleterious effects.

164	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
for each Doppler bin (see Section 5.5.2). In this example, we select three-pulse 
ADPCA. The three-bin post-Doppler case is considered in Section 5.5.2.
Although we have reduced the adaptive DoFs from 256 to 3 × 16 = 48, 
with a commensurate reduction in sample-support requirements, we would 
still like to achieve further reductions to boost robustness. To accomplish this, 
we will next consider data-dependent methods.
Figure 5.22 shows the eigenspectrum for the three-pulse ADPCA covari-
ance matrix. Brennan’s rule predicts a nominal clutter rank of N + β(M − 1) = 
N + β2 = 18, but the actual effective rank is again substantially higher due to 
the composite ISL effects and crabbing. However, by modeling the additional 
clutter subspace by a CMT, we can theoretically reduce the sample support 
to that associated with only 18 DoFs using PC-CMT—which is more than 
an order-of-magnitude reduction from the original full-DoF case. In other 
words, the requisite 3N × 3N ADPCA covariance matrix R is replaced with 
the corresponding PC-CMT estimate

Shown in Figure 5.23 is the performance of the hybrid ADPCA/PCCMT 
approach and a alternate method that substitutes a 10-dB diagonally loaded 
SMI-CMT for the PC-CMT (easier to implement since no eigendecomposi-
tion is required). The performance was achieved with only 2k = 36 training 
samples—as compared with 2NM = 512. Figure 5.24, which shows wind-speed 
errors of ±10 mph, demonstrates the robustness of this approach to errors in 
the estimated CMT. Notice that even in the presence of mismatch, the hybrid 
approach still provides performance commensurate with that associated with a 
far greater sample support. In general, it has been observed that it is better to 
apply a more pessimistic CMT (greater ISL) to impart robustness and prevent 
undernulling [4]. The reader is encouraged to create his or her own recipe for 
achieving similar or perhaps better results.
5.5.2  Signal-Dependent Approach
As described previously in this chapter, a popular and effective first-stage 
signal-dependent and deterministic rank-reduction transformation is Doppler

filtering. Since the spatial distribution of clutter is highly dependent on Dop-
pler, there exists an opportunity to dramatically reduce the number of adap-
tive DoFs without significant loss [1, 2, 5]. For example, Figure 5.25 shows 
the eigenspectrum corresponding to the three-bin post-Doppler covariance 
(3N × 3N) for a normalized Doppler of 0.125 (a relatively low Doppler, thus 
a stressing case). Note that the effective rank of the clutter has been reduced 
from ~100 (see Section 5.5.1) to ~25.
At this stage there remain (M − 2, 3N)-dimensional adaptive filtering 
problems which could be solved with either signal-independent adaptivity (e.g., 
SMI, PC, or PC-CMT) or signal-dependent methods—which is the course 
pursued in this example. If SMI is used, then 6N ~ 96 or more samples are 
required to reduce SINR losses to within 3 dB or so (as discussed in Chapter 
2). However, as we have already seen in the previous example, this sample 
support can be dramatically reduced if we exploit the fact that the effective

rank of the clutter can be substantially less than the total number of DoFs 
(in this case 3N).
As previously described in this chapter, a highly efficient signal-depen-
dent adaptive rank-reduction method is the multistage Wiener filter (MWF). 
The primary design variables in the MWF implementation are the number 
of stages and the sample support [12]. To illustrate the interplay of these two 
design parameters, Figure 5.26 plots the results of a Monte Carlo simulation 
of SINR loss versus the number of MWF stages and sample support for the 
selected normalized Doppler of 0.125. Notice that as sample support increases, 
the number of stages can be reduced and approaches a theoretical optimum 
[12]. Since our objective in this design example is to minimize sample sup-
port while preserving good performance, we might select the (stages, samples) 
combination of (20, 40) with a corresponding SINR loss of approximately 
4 dB relative to the ideal (known-covariance) three-bin post-Doppler case 
(see Figure 5.21). Thus, again we see that it is possible to significantly reduce 
sample-support requirements, in this case from 512 samples to 40.

5.6	 Summary
In this chapter, we surveyed key algorithms of a STAP taxonomy with an eye 
towards their application to stressing real-world scenarios. In particular, both 
data-independent (nonadaptive or deterministic) and data-dependent (or adap-
tive) reduced-rank STAP techniques were discussed and contrasted. The need 
for either deterministic or adaptive reduced-rank methods is inherent in real-
world applications due to a multitude of potential sources of nonstationarity 
and deviation from idealized conditions—which, therefore, places a premium 
on minimizing sample support. Rank reduction (especially deterministic 
methods) can also dramatically reduce real-time computational burdens [1, 
2]. Deterministic and adaptive reduced-rank methods were further delineated 
into either signal-dependent or -independent methods; that is, whether or not 
they depended explicitly on the desired target steering vector.
Illustrative design examples were then presented that highlighted the 
methods of creating hybrid STAP algorithms that combine various rank-
reduction mechanisms. Specifically considered were both a purely signal-
independent example (ADPCA with CMT-augmented PC or diagonally

loaded SMI) and purely signal-dependent example (three-bin post-Doppler 
with MWF). The results illustrated that robust solutions were possible that 
preserve good performance with dramatically reduced sample-support (and 
computational) requirements compared with a full-DoF STAP implementa-
tion. The statistical basis for STAP, further computational considerations, and 
emerging areas of research are addressed in the next chapter.

6.1	 Introduction
In this chapter, we briefly discuss several important topics in STAP applica-
tions and current research. The statistical basis for STAP is presented in Sec-
tion 6.2, along with a brief discussion of current research trends in this area. 
Section 6.3 considers implementation issues. An important class of real-time 
QR factorization computing architectures is extended to include the CMT 
approach introduced in Chapter 5—thereby expanding the class of robust 
STAP algorithms amenable to current real-time implementation architectures. 
Chapters 7 and 8 address two new important areas in state-of-the-art STAP, 
namely “STAP on Transmit” and “Knowledge-Aided STAP.”
6.2	 Statistical Basis for STAP
The space-time beamformer derived in Chapters 2 and 3 was optimum in 
both a max SINR sense and, if viewed from an SLC perspective, a minimum 
MSE sense as well. However, nothing was said concerning its statistical (i.e., 
probabilistic) optimality [1].
For the additive Gaussian interference case, the max SINR beamformer 
can be shown to be statistically optimal. To see this, consider the basic target 
detection binary hypothesis testing problem [1, 2]:

174	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
	
H0: x = n	
(target absent)	
(6.1)
	
H1: x = s + n	
(target present)	
where x ∈ ℂNM is the received space-time array snapshot corresponding to a 
given range bin, s ∈ ℂNM is the target steering vector (assumed to be known, 
or as is done in practice, hypothesized), and n ∈ ℂNM is the total interference 
RV (receiver noise, clutter, jamming, and so on). Our objective is to construct 
a decision function that is, in some sense, optimal in terms of maximizing the 
probability of detection, while simultaneously maintaining the probability of 
false alarms.
For many sensor surveillance systems, the universally adopted framework 
for constructing an optimum detection test is the Neyman-Pearson criterion 
[1, 2], which maximizes the probability of detection for a fixed false-alarm 
rate. The corresponding decision criterion is the intuitively appealing likeli-
hood ratio test given by

p x H1
(

⎧⎨⎩
	
(6.2)
where p(x⎪H0) and p(x⎪H1) are the conditional probabilities for the observation 
RV x under the target-absent and target-present conditions, respectively [1, 2]. 
The strictly positive threshold γ is chosen to fix the probability of false alarm 
[1]. Note that a completely equivalent test based on the log-likelihood (due to 
the monotonicity of the log function for positive-valued arguments) is given by
	
lnΛ(x) ln p x H1
(
) −ln p x H0
(
)
> lng ,
say H1
< lng ,
say H0
⎧⎨⎩
	
(6.3)
For the complex Gaussian case (see Chapter 2), we can make further progress 
in specifying the exact nature of the test in (6.3). Based on (6.1), p(x⎪H0) is 
given by
	
p x H0
(
) =
1
p N R e−x¢R−1x 	
(6.4)
where R is the total NM × NM-dimensional interference covariance matrix, 
which is assumed to be nonsingular, and ⎪R⎪ is its corresponding determinant. 
The corresponding target-present conditional probability, p(x⎪H1), is given by

	
Other Topics

(6.5)
Substituting (6.5) and (6.4) into (6.3) yields

⎡⎣
⎤⎦
= 2Re s¢R−1x
{
} −s¢R−1s
	
(6.6)
The only term in (6.6) that depends on the observed data (and thus cannot 
be precomputed) is the quantity
	
z = s′R–1x	
(6.7)
which we can write as
	
z = w′x	
(6.8)
where
	
w = R–1s	
(6.9)
Thus, an equivalent optimum detector for the additive (known statistics) 
Gaussian case is precisely the max SINR space-time beamformer, whose resi-
due is compared to a threshold. In the statistical literature, (6.7) is known as 
a sufficient statistic [1] since it can be substituted for all of the data so far as 
detection is concerned.
Of course in practice, as discussed in Chapter 4, the total interference 
covariance matrix is generally not known a priori (apart from the additional 
Gaussian assumption). Thus, in reality, the simple binary detection problem 
is a composite hypothesis testing problem [1].
A well-known approach in this case is the generalized likelihood ratio 
test (GLRT), which consists of a modified likelihood ratio test in which the 
unknown quantities are replaced with their MLEs under each of the assumed 
conditions [1, 2], that is,

Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
As mentioned in Chapter 2 for the Gaussian case under the target-absent 
hypothesis H0, under the assumption that there are L ≥ NM i.i.d. target-free 
samples available, the MLE of ˆR0  is given by the SCM [3], that is,
	
ˆR0 = 1

(6.11)
where L ≥ NM. If the presence of a target is assumed not to affect the inter-
ference statistics (assumed identical for each test cell), then ˆR0  can be sub-
stituted for ˆR1.
The above highly restrictive derivations should motivate the reader to 
appreciate the theoretical difficulties associated with extending optimal sta-
tistical procedures to the generally nonstationary, non-Gaussian case in the 
presence of unknown signal-mismatch statistics [4–6], which of course is the 
real world. Some progress in developing detectors that preserve the CFAR 
property has been made for the class of elliptically contoured distributions 
(ECDs), which is a generalization of the Gaussian case [5, 6]. Also, a more 
effective detection scheme than the GLRT for the finite sample case has been 
developed by Kelly [7] (popularly known as the Kelly test).
At the time of this writing, the most common practical approach to the 
detection problem is a two-stage method in which the scalar residue from a 
robust STAP beamformer is then fed to some form of a cell-averaging CACFAR 
detector [8], as shown in Figure 6.1. Due to any or all of the aforementioned 
practical STAP shortcomings, the noise-only residue from the STAP beam-
former is generally greater than the theoretical optimum (i.e., the white-noise

insertion of the CACFAR circuit after the STAP processor is due to inevitable statistical 
mismatches leading to improperly nulled interference.

177
floor) and is also nonstationary [8]. Thus, the job of the CACFAR circuit is 
to estimate the local noise-floor residue (generally accomplished via a sliding 
window mean or median estimator [8]) and set a detection threshold based 
on this estimate so as to maintain a prescribed false-alarm rate. Designing a 
robust CACFAR algorithm is a challenging problem in and of itself. Indeed, 
one of the major motivations for considering the advanced minimal-sample-
support STAP techniques of Chapter 5 is to lessen the burden on the CACFAR 
designer—since the only DoF is essentially a scalar threshold. The reader is 
referred to the authoritative text by Nitzberg [8] for further details on CAC-
FAR design.
6.3	 STAP Implementation
Consider a hypothetical radar with a 1-kHz PRF and a bandwidth of 10 
MHz. It has approximately 10,000 unambiguous range bins to process. If 
each range bin has N spatial and M temporal DoFs, then a single CPI could 
involve as many as 10,000 NM × NM covariance matrix estimation/inver-
sion STAP operations, easily resulting in a compute throughput measured in 
the hundreds of GFLOPS (hundreds of billions of floating-point operations). 
Thus, from the very onset, a radar designer must look for very efficient parallel-
processing implementations.
Many such architectures have been developed for SMI-based techniques 
[9, 10]. One of the more popular is the systolic array implementation of the 
QR-factorized SMI. It results from recasting the SMI problem in terms of an 
equivalent QR decomposition as follows.
First, recall the SMI formulation for the STAP weight vector w:
	
xlxl¢
l=1
L
∑
⎛
⎝⎜
⎞
⎠⎟w = (YY ¢)w = s 	
(6.12)
where by definition, Y = [x1, … , xL] is the NM × L data matrix (matrix of 
space-time array snapshots), and the 1/L factor has been dropped from the 
sample covariance for convenience since it does not affect the SINR (it could 
easily be absorbed into Y). A QR factorization of Y ′is of the form
	
QY ¢ =
r
∅
⎡
⎣⎢
⎤
⎦⎥	
(6.13)

178	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
where Q is an L × L unitary matrix (i.e., Q′Q = I), r is an NM × NM upper 
triangular positive-definite matrix, and ∅ is an (L − NM ) × NM null matrix. 
Substituting Q′Q into (6.12) yields
	
YY ¢w = YQ ¢QY ¢w
= r¢ ∅¢
[
]
r
∅
⎡
⎣⎢
⎤
⎦⎥w
= r¢rw = s
	
(6.14)
which can be solved in two steps involving straightforward backsubstitutions 
(due to the triangular nature of r) [10] as follows:
	
r′a = s	
(6.15)
	
rw = a	
An important benefit of this formulation is that the numerical condition 
number (ratio of largest to smallest eigenvalue [10]) of r is the square root of 
the sample covariance. Additionally, the QR decomposition itself can be effi-
ciently implemented via a sequence of Givens rotations [10].
Diagonal loading can easily be accommodated in this framework by 
augmenting the data matrix Y with a diagonal matrix whose entries are the 
square root of the desired loading factor; that is,
	
YDL = Y
de1 … deNM
⎡⎣
⎤⎦
= Y
d I
⎡⎣
⎤⎦
	
(6.16)
where e1, … , eNM are the NM Euclidean basis vectors, and I is the NM-
dimensional identity matrix. The corresponding diagonally loaded sample 
covariance matrix is thus given by
	
YDLYDL¢ = YY ¢ + dI 	
(6.17)
where δ is the desired loading factor. From (6.17) we see that the inclusion of 
diagonal loading in the data domain [10] has the effect of creating more data 
samples—albeit artificially. This is a reasonable result since diagonal loading 
is a form of structured-covariance estimation and has been shown to produce 

	
Other Topics
179
results (under conditions that agree with the model) equivalent to those associ-
ated with far greater sample supports (see Chapters 2 and 5).
Interestingly, this data-augmentation approach can also be extended to 
include CMTs. This is of important practical value since a diagonally loaded 
SMI augmented with a CMT can closely approximate the highly effective 
PC-CMT algorithm—without the need for a difficult-to-implement eigen-
decomposition. To see how this is accomplished, we first need to introduce 
an interesting Hadamard matrix multiplication identity discovered by Khatri 
and Rao [11].
Theorem
Let A and B be matrices of size n × n with corresponding factorizations A = 
Ψ′Ψ and B = Ω′Ω, where Ψ is of order q × n and Ω is of order p × n. Then 
the Hadamard product of A and B expressed in terms of its factors is given by
	
A ○ B = (Ψ ⊙ Ω)′(Ψ ⊙ Ω)	
(6.18)
where ⊙ is the Khatri-Rao product, which consists of the pairwise Kronecker 
products of the columns of Ψ and Ω; that is,
	
Ψ ⊙ Ω = [ψ 1 ⊗ ω 1  ψ 2 ⊗ ω 2  …  ψ n ⊗ ω n]	
(6.19)
where ψ i and ω i are the ith columns of Ψ and Ω, respectively.
Proof
Although algebraically straightforward, the interested reader is referred to the 
book by Rao for a proof [11].
Now consider the application of a CMT to the SCM
	
R  T = (YY ¢)  T 	
(6.20)
As discussed in Chapter 5, the structure of T is quite simple in practice and 
can be essentially fixed for a given operating environment (channel mismatch 
and more). Being positive-semidefinite [12], a Gram or square-root factoriza-
tion of T is guaranteed [13]. Thus, (6.20) can be rewritten as
	
(YY ¢)  T = (YY ¢)  (Γ¢Γ)
= (Z¢Z)  (Γ¢Γ)
= (Z Γ)¢(Z Γ)
	
(6.21)

where T = Γ′Γ and, by definition, Z = Y′. The advantage of (6.21) is that 
the same QR factorization and implementation architecture can be applied 
to the augmented data matrix (Z ○ Γ)′. A simple example will illustrate the 
basic procedure.
Consider a simple two-channel adaptive beamformer implementing a 
diagonally loaded SMI-CMT (obviously this is of no practical interest, but it 
is useful for illustrating the process). Assume that there are four i.i.d. samples 
available for estimating the SCM; that is,
	
Y =

Although highly contrived and simple, the foregoing example nonethe-
less illustrates that the final STAP algorithm, which includes data-domain 
formulations and techniques for improving its robustness (e.g., diagonal 
loading and/or CMTs), can be more computationally demanding then one 
might at first expect. This is certainly true for the far more complex struc-
tured-covariance estimation methods described in Chapter 5 and elsewhere. 
For further details on real-time implementation, the reader is referred to the 
literature ([9, 10]).

6.4	 Summary
In this chapter, several important topics were surveyed. Section 6.2 introduced 
the statistical basis for STAP establishing the optimality of the max SINR 
beamformer for the additive Gaussian case and discussed current research 
trends in this area. Section 6.3 considered implementation issues with an 
emphasis on an important class of real-time QR factorization computing 
architectures. This popular implementation method was extended to the CMT 
approach introduced in Chapter 5, thereby expanding the class of robust STAP 
algorithms amenable to real-time implementation.
Problems
1.	 Show that the nonadaptive STAP beamformer with w = s is statisti-
cally optimum for the additive Gaussian white noise case (i.e., R = 
σ 2I).
2.	 Looking at (6.5). Can you argue in words why z = s′R–1x is a suf-
ficient statistic?
3.	 What is the key difference in the Kelly test formulation of the general-
ized likelihood ratio test in (6.10)? (See [17] for an excellent descrip-
tion of the Kelly test.)
4.	 In knowledge-aided (KA) STAP (see Chapter 8), a sample-based esti-
mate ˆR  of R is often augmented with a KA ˆRKA  estimate obtained 
from other knowledge sources such as digital terrain maps and SAR 
imagery. The new estimate is often of the form ˆR + ˆRKA . If ˆR  is of 
the form YY′ as in (6.12), show that the new estimate ˆR + ˆRKA  has a 
data domain representation of YCL = [Y  YKA] where ˆRKA = YKA ′
YKA . 
(HINT: Consider YCLY′CL.) Additional note: The addition of a nondi-
agonal positive semidefinite matrix is sometimes referred to as “col-
ored loading.”

STAP on Transmit*
7.1  Introduction
Modern advances in radar front-end hardware—such as solid state trans-
mitters, digital arbitrary waveform generators (DAWGs), active electroni-
cally scanned arrays (AESAs), and high performance embedded computing 
(HPEC)—have afforded an opportunity to reexamine the design of what and 
how a radar transmits its spatio-temporal RF signals. Conventional modern 
radars generally use nonadaptive transmit configurations that typically opti-
mize some metric associated with a multidimensional ambiguity function 
(e.g., range, Doppler, angle [2]), and do not adapt the transmitter to an ever-
changing target and interference channel, other than changing the operating 
frequency band or bandwidth. Common examples include the very popular 
constant modulus linear FM (LFM) waveform, and low sidelobe transmit 
antennas [2]. However, because the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise 
ratio (SINR) depends on the transmit characteristics, it is natural to ask “for 
a given channel model, what is the optimum transmit-receive configuration?”
While adaptive processing has long since been implemented in the receive 
chain of radar, beginning with automatic gain control and cell averaging 
* To the best of the author’s knowledge, the term “STAP on transmit” was first coined by P. Cor-
bell (see [1]).

Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
constant false alarm rate (CACFAR) [3] in the earliest days of radar to today’s 
space-time adaptive processing (STAP) [4], adaptivity in the transmit chain 
is virtually nonexistent—save for “mode” adaptivity, such as switching in dif-
ferent non-adaptive waveforms (PRF, bandwidth, etc).
Beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s, a few researchers began looking into 
the potential benefits of adaptive illumination (see these early references by 
Gjessing [5], Farina [6], and Guerci, et al. [7–10]). While potential was identi-
fied under certain conditions, radar hardware lagged far behind, so not much 
in the way of real engineering development was initially pursued. Steadily, 
however—over a period spanning two decades—continual RF hardware 
advances (as described above) and relevant applications began to emerge and 
to take hold. This trend continues up to the present.
In this chapter, we develop the basic theory of optimal space-time trans-
mit-receive design using a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) formulation 
that can account for all potential degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) such as waveform 
(fast-time), angle, and polarization as a function of the composite radar chan-
nel. Various applications and examples are provided to further illustrate the 
potential impact of joint transmit-receive adaptivity.
Section 7.2 introduces the basic MIMO channel formulation and 
derives the optimal transmitter-receiver configuration for the additive col-
ored noise case. Several examples exercising different DoFs (such as fast-time 
and spatial) are then presented to illustrate the basic theory and demonstrate 
the flexibility of the formulation. Next in Section 7.3, the formalism is 
extended to account for the basic signal-to-clutter problem. In Section 7.4, 
a basic theory for optimizing transmit-receive configuration for the target 
ID problem is introduced. Next, the concept of constrained MIMO wave-
form design is addressed in Section 7.5 to account for important real-world 
constraints (such as constant modulus). Finally, in Section 7.6, the idea of 
adaptive MIMO waveform design is introduced when the channel must be 
estimated on the fly.
7.2  Optimum MIMO Waveform Design for the Additive 
Colored Noise Case
Consider the basic radar block diagram in Figure 7.1. A generally complex-
valued and multidimensional transmit signal, s ∈ ℂN, (i.e., an N-dimensional 
multi-input (MI) signal) interacts with a target denoted by the target transfer 
matrix HT ∈ ℂM×N. The resulting M-dimensional multi-output (MO) signal 
(echo), y ∈ ℂM, is then received along with additive colored noise (ACN),

n ∈ ℂM. The vector-matrix formulation is completely general inasmuch as any 
combination of spatial and temporal dimensions can be represented.
For example, the N-dimensional input vector s could represent the N 
complex (i.e., in-phase and quadrature—I&Q [11]) samples of a single chan-
nel transmit waveform s(t), for example,
	
s =
s t1

The corresponding target transfer matrix HT would thus contain the 
corresponding samples of the complex target impulse response hT(t), which 
for the causal linear time invariant (LTI) case would have the form [12]

where, without loss of generality, we have assumed uniform time sampling 
(i.e., τ k = (k − 1)T), where T is a suitably chosen sampling interval [13]. Note 
also that without loss of generality, we have for both convenience and a sig-
nificant reduction in mathematical nomenclature overhead, chosen N = M 
(i.e., the same number of transmit and receive DoFs). The reader is encouraged 
to, where desired, reinstate the inequality and confirm that the underlying 
equations derived throughout this chapter have the same basic form except 
for differing vector and matrix dimensionalities. Note also that, in general, 
HT is stochastic (this will be addressed shortly).
The formalism is readily extensible to the multiple transmitter, multiple 
receiver case. For example, if there are three (3) independent transmit and 
receive channels (e.g., an active electronically scanned array or AESA with 
separate waveform generators for each transmit element or subarray), then the 
input vector s of Figure 7.1 would have the form

These examples make clear that the matrix-vector, input-output formal-
ism is completely general and can accommodate whatever transmit-receive 
DoFs desired. Returning to Figure 7.1, we now wish to jointly optimize the 
transmit and receive functions. We will find it convenient to work backwards—
that is, to begin by optimizing the receiver as a function of the input and then 
to optimize the input—and thus the overall output SINR.
For any finite norm input s, the receiver that maximizes output SINR 
for the ACN case is the so-called whitening (or colored noise) matched filter, 
as shown in Figure 7.2 [14]. Note that for the additive Gaussian colored noise 
(AGCN) case, this receiver is also statistically optimum [14].
If R ∈ ℂN×N denotes the total interference covariance matrix associated 
with n, which is further assumed to be independent of s and Hermitian posi-
tive definite [15] (guaranteed in practice due to ever-present receiver noise 
[14]), then the corresponding whitening filter is given by [14]
	
Hw = R–1/2	
(7.5)
The reader should verify the whitening properties of (7.5) (see Problem 7.1 
and [16]).
The output of the linear whitening filter z ∈ ℂN will consist of signal

(7.6)
where ys ∈ ℂN denotes the target echo as shown in Figure 7.2 (i.e., the output

Since the noise has been whitened via a linear—in this case, full rank—
transformation [14]), the final receiver stage consists of a white noise matched 
filter of the form (to within a multiplicative scalar)
	
wz = zs ∈ ℂN

(7.8)
where var(⋅) denotes the variance operator. Note that, due to the whitening 
operation, E{znz′n} = I.

	
STAP on Transmit
191
In other words, the output SINR is proportional to the energy in the 
whitened target echo. This is key to optimizing the input function: Chose s 
(the input) to maximize the energy in the whitened target echo, for example,
	
max
{s}   zs¢zs 	
(7.9)
Substituting zs = HwHTs into (7.9) yields the objective function that explicitly 
depends on the input
	
max
{s}   s¢(H ¢H)s 	
(7.10)
where
	
H  HwHT	
(7.11)
Recognizing that (7.10) involves the magnitude of the inner product of 
two vectors s and (H′H)s, we readily have from the Cauchy-Schwarz theorem 
[17], the condition which s must satisfy to yield a maximum, namely s must 
be collinear with (H′H)s, thus,
	
(H′H)sopt = λ maxsopt	
(7.12)
T﻿hat is, the optimum input sopt must be an eigenfunction of (H′H) with 
associated maximum eigenvalue.
It is important to recognize that the above set of input-output design 
equations represent the absolute optimum that any combination of transmit-
receive operations can achieve. They are thus of fundamental value to the 
radar systems engineer interested in ascertaining the value of advanced adap-
tive methods (e.g., adaptive waveforms, transmit-receive beamforming, etc). 
Note also that (7.12) can be generalized to the case where the target response 
is random, for example,
	
E{H′H}sopt = λ maxsopt	
(7.13)
In this case, sopt maximizes the expected value of the energy in the whitened 
target echo.
Next, we illustrate the application of the above-mentioned optimum 
design equations to the additive colored noise problem arising from a broad-
band multipath interference source.

7.2.1  Additive Colored Noise Example Arising from Broadband 
Multipath Interference
This example illustrates the optimum transmit-receive configuration for maxi-
mizing output SINR in the presence of colored noise interference arising from 
a multipath broadband noise source. More specifically, for the single transmit-
receive channel case, it derives the optimum transmit pulse modulation (i.e., 
pulse shape).
Figure 7.3 illustrates the situation at hand. A nominally broadband 
white noise source undergoes a series of multipath scatterings that, in turn, 
colors the noise spectrum [18]. Assuming (for simplicity) that the multipath 
reflections are dominated by several discrete specular reflections, the resultant 
signal can be viewed as the output of a causal tapped delay line filter (i.e., an 
FIR filter [12]) of the form
	
hmp[k] = α 0δ[k] + α 1δ[k − 1] + … + α q–1δ[k − q − 1]	
(7.14)
that is driven by white noise. The corresponding input-output transfer Hmp 
∈ ℂN×N is thus given by

While certainly a more complex (and thus realistic) target model could be 
assumed, we wish to focus on the impact the colored noise has on shaping 
the optimum transmit pulse. We will introduce more complex target response 
models in the target ID section.

That is, the optimum transmit waveform is the maximum eigenfunction associ-
ated with the inverse of the interference covariance matrix. The reader should 
verify that this is also the minimum eigenfunction of the original covariance 
matrix R—and thus can be computed without matrix inversion.
Displayed in Figures 7.4(a) and (b) are the spectra of the optimum trans-
mit pulses obtained by solving (7.21) for the maximum eigenfunction/eigen-
value pair for the aforementioned short and long pulse cases respectively. Note 
how the optimum transmit spectrum naturally emphasizes those portions of 
the spectrum where the interference is weak—an intuitively satisfying result.

Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
The increase in SINR for the long pulse case is to be expected because 
it has finer spectral resolution and can, therefore, more precisely shape the 
transmit modulation to anti-match the interference. Of course, the uncon-
strained optimum pulse has certain practical deficiencies (such as poorer reso-
lution and compression sidelobes) when compared to a conventional pulse. 
We will revisit these issues in Section 7.5, where constrained optimization is 
introduced and discussed.
The above example is similar in spirit to the spectrum notching wave-
form design problem that arises when there are strong cochannel narrowband 
interferers present [21]. In this case, it is not only desirable to filter out the 
interference on receive, but also to choose a transmit waveform that mini-
mizes energy in the cochannel bands. The reader is encouraged to experiment 
with different notched spectra and pulse length assumptions and apply (7.12). 
Nonimpulsive target models can also be readily incorporated.
7.3  Optimum MIMO Design for Maximizing 
Signal-to-Clutter
The joint MIMO optimization of the transmit and receive functions for the 
general additive colored noise plus clutter (signal dependent noise) has been 
shown to result in a highly nonlinear problem [22] (though efficient iterative 
methods have been developed to solve these equations [22])—for all but the 
case of very restrictive clutter statistics (see [23]). However, in practice, there 
is often a natural separation principle between additive colored noise (sig-
nal independent) and clutter (signal dependent). For example, narrowband 
electromagnetic interference (EMI) resulting from cochannel interference 
might require fast-time receiver and transmit spectral notching [21], leaving 
the slow-time and/or spatial DoFs available for clutter suppression. Similarly, 
adaptive beamforming for broadband jammer nulling can be separated from 
the clutter suppression problem in a two-stage approach (see [24]). In this sec-
tion, we will thus concentrate on the clutter dominant case and focus solely 
on maximizing the output signal-to-clutter (SCR) ratio.
Unlike the previous colored noise case in Chapter 3, Section 3.2, clutter 
(i.e., channel reverberations) is a form of signal dependent noise [25, 26]—
because the clutter returns depend on the transmit signal characteristics (e.g., 
transmit antenna pattern and strength, operating frequencies, bandwidths, 
polarization, etc.). Referring to Figure 7.5, the corresponding SCR at the input 
to the receiver is given by

Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
The application of (7.25) and (7.26) to the full-up space-time clutter 
suppression of MTI clutter is available in [27]. Here, we will consider its 
application to the sidelobe target suppression problem—which, of course, is 
at the heart of the ground clutter interference issue. This is because clutter is 
essentially unwanted target returns.
7.3.1  Sidelobe Target Suppression
Consider a narrowband N = 16 element uniform linear array (ULA) with half-
wavelength inter-element spacing and a quiescent pattern, like the one displayed 
in Figure 7.6. This is essentially the ULA that we have previously considered 
earlier in this book. In addition to the desired target at a normalized angle of 
q  = 0, there are strong sidelobe targets at q1  = −0.3, q2  = +0.1, q3  = +0.25, 
as shown Figure 7.6, where a normalized angle is defined as
	
q d
lsinq 	
(7.27)
where d is the interelement spacing of the ULA and λ is the operating wave-
length (consistent units and narrowband operation assumed).
The presence of these targets (possibly large clutter discretes) could have 
been previously detected, and thus their directions known. Their strong sid-
elobes could potentially mask weaker mainlobe targets. With this knowledge, it 
is desired to minimize any energy from these targets leaking into the mainbeam 
detection of the target of interest by nulling on transmit—that is, by plac-
ing transmit antenna pattern nulls in the directions of the unwanted targets.
For the case at hand, the (m,n)-th elements of the target and interferer 
transfer matrices are given respectively by
	
[HT]m,n = e jφ(const.)	
(7.28)
	
Hc
⎡⎣
⎤⎦m,n = a1e j2p(m−n)q1 + a2e j2p(m−n)q2 + a3e j2p(m−n)q3 	
(7.29)
where φ is an overall bulk delay (two-way propagation) that does not affect 
the solution to (7.25) and will thus be subsequently ignored; [Hc]m,n denotes 
the (m,n)-th element of the clutter transfer matrix and consists of the linear 
superposition of the three target returns resulting from transmitting a nar-
rowband signal from the nth transmit element and receiving it on the mth

receive element of a ULA that utilizes the same array for transmit and receive 
[4, 20]. Note that, in practice, there would be a random relative phase between 
the signals in (7.29), which, for convenience we, have ignored, but which can 
easily be accommodated by taking the expected value of the kernel H′cHc.
Solving (7.25) for the optimum eigenvector yields the transmit pattern 
that maximizes the SCR—which is the pattern also displayed in Figure 7.6. 
The competing target amplitudes were set to 40 dB relative to the desired tar-
get, and 0 dB of diagonal loading was added to H′cHc to improve numerical 
conditioning and allow for its inversion. Though this is somewhat arbitrary, 
it does provide a mechanism for controlling null depth—which in practice is 
limited by the amount of transmit channel mismatch [28]. Note the presence 
of transmit antenna pattern nulls in the directions of the competing targets 
as desired.

7.3.2  Optimal Pulse Shape for Maximizing SCR
In this simple example, we rigorously verify an intuitively obvious result 
regarding pulse shape and detecting a point target in uniform clutter. Namely, 
that the best waveform for detecting a point target in distributed i.i.d clutter 
is itself an impulse (i.e., a waveform with maximal resolution). This is a well-
known result rigorously proven by Manasse [29] using a different method.
Consider a unity point target, arbitrarily chosen to be at the temporal 
origin. Its corresponding impulse response and transfer matrix are respectively 
given by
	
hT[n] = δ[n]	
(7.30)
and
	
HT = IN×N	
(7.31)
where IN×N denotes the N × N identity matrix. For uniformly distributed clut-
ter, the corresponding impulse response is of the form
	
hc[n] =

For example, the optimum pulse shape for detecting a point target is itself an 
impulse. This should be immediately obvious since it is the shape that only 
excites the range bin with the target and zeros out all other range bin returns 
that contain competing clutter.
Of course transmitting a short pulse (much less an impulse) is problem-
atic in the real world (e.g., high peak power pulses), and thus an approximation 
to a short pulse in the form of a spread spectrum waveform (e.g., LFM) is often 
employed [19]. This example also makes clear that, in the case of uniform ran-
dom clutter, there is nothing to be gained by sophisticated pulse shaping for 
a point target, other than to maximize bandwidth (i.e., range resolution)—a 
well-known result rigorously proven by Manasse [29]. The interested reader is

referred to [27] for further examples of optimizing other DoFs (such as angle-
Doppler) for the clutter mitigation problem.
Up to this point, we have been focused on judiciously choosing the 
transmit-receive DoFs to maximize SINR or SCR. In the next section, we 
will extend this framework to the target identification problem.
7.4  Optimum MIMO Design for Target Identification
Consider the problem of determining target type when two possibilities exist 
(the multitarget case is addressed later in this section). This can be cast as a 
classical binary hypothesis testing problem [14], for example,
	
(Target 1)  H1:  y1 + n = HT1s + n	
(7.40)
	
(Target 1)  H2:  y2 + n = HT2s + n	
where HT1, HT2 denote the target transfer matrices for Targets 1 and 2, respec-
tively. For the AGN case, the well-known optimum receiver decision structure 
consists of a bank of matched filters, each tuned to a different target assump-
tion, followed by comparator as shown in Figure 7.7 [14]. Note that the above 
presupposes that either Target 1 or 2 is present—but not both. Also, it has 
been tacitly assumed that a target present test has been conducted in order to 
ensure that a target is indeed present (i.e., binary detection test [14]). Alter-
natively, the null hypothesis (no target present) can be included in the test 
as a separate hypothesis (see the discussion below for the multitarget case).
Figure 7.8 illustrates the situation at hand. If Target 1 is present, the 
observed signal y1 + n will tend to cluster about the #1 point in observation

space, which could include any number of dimensions relevant to the target 
ID problem (e.g., fast-time, angle, Doppler, polarization, etc). The uncer-
tainty sphere (generally ellipsoid for AGCN case) surrounding #1 in Figure 
7.7 represents the 1-sigma probability for the additive noise n—similarly for 
#2. Clearly, if y1 and y2 are relatively well-separated, the probability of correct 
classification is commensurately high.
Of significant note is the fact that y1 and y2 depend on the transmit 
signal s, as shown in (7.40). Consequently, it should be possible to select an 
s that maximizes the separation between y1 and y2, thereby maximizing the 
probability of correct classification under modest assumptions regarding the 
conditional pdfs (e.g., unimodality, see below), for example,

Equation (7.45) has an interesting interpretation: sopt is that transmit 
input that maximally separates the target responses and is the maximum 
eigenfunction of the transfer kernel H′H formed by the difference between 
the target transfer matrices (i.e., (7.43)). Again if the composite target transfer 
matrix is stochastic, H′H is replaced with its expected value E{H′H} in (7.45).
7.4.1  Two Target Identification Example
Let h1[n] and h2[n] denote the impulse responses of Targets #1 and #2, respec-
tively, as shown in Figure 7.9. Figure 7.10 shows two different (normalized) 
transmit waveforms: (1) chirp, and (2) optimum (per (7.45))—along with their 
corresponding normalized separation norms of 0.45 and 1, respectively (which 
corresponds to 6.9 dB improvement in separation). To determine the relative 
probabilities of correct classification for the different transmit waveforms, one 
would first need to set the SNR level, (which fixes the conditional probability 
density functions (pdf), herein assumed to be circular Gaussian), then measure 
the amount of overlap to calculate the probability [14].
It is not at all obvious as to why the optimum pulse achieves much better 
performance simply by looking at the time domain waveform. However, an

examination of Figure 7.11 reveals the mechanism by which enhanced separa-
tion is achieved. It shows the Fourier spectrum H(ω) = HT1(ω) − HT2(ω), along 
with that of Sopt(ω). Note that Sopt(ω) places more energy in those spectral 
regions where H(ω) is large (i.e., regions where the difference between targets 
is large—again an intuitively appealing result).
While pulse modulation was used to illustrate the optimum transmit 
design equations, we could theoretically have used any transmit DOFs (e.g., 
polarization). The choice clearly depends on the application at hand.
7.4.2  Optimality for the Two-Target Case
Referring to Figure 7.8, we see that the solution to (7.45) maximizes the condi-
tional pdf separation metric d = ‖d‖. For the additive noise case with unimodal 
pdf, maximizing d minimizes the overlap of the two conditional pdfs, and 
thus is a statistically optimum choice for s. Note that a Gaussian assumption 
is not required. Does this result hold up if the noise pdf is not unimodal?

7.4.4  Multitarget Identification Example
Figure 7.12 depicts the impulse responses of three different targets, two of 
which are the same as in the previous two target example. Solving (7.48) and 
(7.49) yields an optimally separating waveform whose average separation 
defined by (7.46) is 1.0, as compared to 0.47 for the chirp—an improvement 
of 6.5 dB, which is slightly less than the previous example. This be expected 
because more is being asked of the waveform probe for the three target case. 
As expected, the optimum waveform outperforms (in this case, significantly) 
that of an unoptimized pulse such as the chirp.

7.5  Constrained Optimum MIMO Radar
Often in practice there are a number of practical considerations that may 
preclude transmitting the unconstrained optimum solutions developed so far. 
We will thus consider two cases of constrained optimization, namely Case 1:

with known interferers, such as unwanted targets and/or clutter discretes to 
which we wish to apply transmit nulls.
Equation (7.51) defines the feasible solution subspace for the constrained 
optimization problem. It is straightforward to verify that the projection operator
	
P = I − G′(GG′)–1G	
(7.52)
projects any x ∈ CN into the feasible subspace [31]. Thus, we can first apply 
the projection operator then perform an unconstrained subspace optimization 
to obtain the solution to (7.50) and (7.51), for example,

7.5.1  Pre-Nulling on Transmit Example
If there are known directions for which it is desired not to transmit (unwanted 
targets, clutter discrete, “keep-out” zones, etc), it is possible to formulate a 
linearly constrained optimization accordingly.
Assume that there is a desired target at qT ,  as well as two keep-out 
angles (normalized) qI1  and qI2 .  The corresponding elements of the target 
transfer matrix HT ∈ CN×N, assuming an N-element ULA, are thus given by

Figure 7.13 shows the resulting constrained optimum transmit pattern 
for the case when qT  = 0, qI1  = −0.25, qI2  = 0.4. As expected, a peak is 
placed in the desired target direction with nulls simultaneously placed in the 
keep-out directions.
Case II: Nonlinear Constraints
In practice, there are other generally nonlinear constraints that may arise. One 
family of such constraints relates to the admissibility of transmit waveforms—
such as the class of constant modulus and stepped frequency waveforms [19], 
to name a few.

For example, if it is desired to transmit a waveform that is nominally of 
the LFM type (or any other prescribed type), but which is allowed to mod-
estly deviate to better match the channel characteristics, then the nonlinear 
constrained optimization has the form

subject to:  s −sLFM ≤d 	
(7.59)
The above and similar problems cannot generally be solved in closed 
form. However, there are approximate methods that can yield satisfactory 
results—we will consider two such methods, which are based on very differ-
ent approaches. These simpler methods could form the basis of more complex 
methods—such as seeding nonlinear search methods.
7.5.1.1  Relaxed Projection Approach
Figure 7.14 depicts the constrained optimization problem of (7.58) and (7.59). 
It shows the general situation in which the unconstrained optimum solution 
does not reside within the constrained (i.e., admissible) subspace Ω. In this 
particular case, the admissible subspace is defined as
	
Ω = s: s −sLFM ≤d
{
} 	
(7.60)
where δ ≥ 0 is some maximum acceptable error. An important property of Ω is 
that it is convex [32]; that is, if s1,s2 ∈ Ω, then any linear convex combination 
ŝ = αs1 + (1 − α)s2, where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, is also in Ω (i.e., ŝ ∈ Ω). The proof is 
relatively straightforward, based on an application of the Triangle Inequality 
of vector norms [33]:
	
sLFM −ˆs = sLFM −as1 + (1−a)s2

= a sLFM −s1

Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
Since Ω is convex, the point in this set that is closest in a vector norm sense 
to point exterior to this set is simply the projection of this exterior point onto 
Ω, which lies on its surface [32]. Thus the waveform in Ω that is closest to 
the unconstrained optimum sopt lies on the surface of Ω along the direction 
io, which is the unit norm vector that points from sLFM to sopt, for example,
	
io 
sopt −sLFM
sopt −sLFM
	
(7.62)
Thus, the closest constrained waveform is given by
	
ŝopt = sLFM + δio	
(7.63)
Note that if δ is allowed to relax to the point where δ = ‖sopt − sLFM‖, then 
ŝopt = sopt.

within a subspace (in this case, convex) defined to be close to a prescribed transmit 
input (in this case, an LFM waveform).

7.5.2  Relaxed Projection Example
In this example, we impose an LFM similarity constraint on the same previ-
ously discussed multipath interference problem. Specifically, in Figure 7.15, 
we plot the loss in SINR relative to the unconstrained long pulse optimum 
solution previously obtained as a function of δ, which is varied between 0 ≤ 
δ ≤ ‖sopt − sLFM‖. Note that, for this example improvement in performance 
is generally monotonically increases with increasing δ, (except for a very small 
region near the origin, which illustrates the generally nonlinear nature of the 
problem), and that sizeable SINR improvements can be achieved for relatively 
modest values of the relaxation parameter. In other words, a waveform with 
LFM-like properties can be constructed and can still achieve significant SINR 
performance gains relative to an unoptimized LFM.

Figure 7.16 shows the spectra of the unoptimized LFM, along with the 
unconstrained optimum and the relaxed projection pulse with a 20% relaxation 
parameter. Note how the relaxed pulse is significantly closer to the original 
LFM spectrum, yet still achieves nearly a 10 dB improvement in SINR rela-
tive to the LFM waveform.
7.5.2.1  Constant Modulus and the Method of Stationary Phase
As has become apparent from the previous examples, spectral shaping plays 
a key role in achieving matching gains. However, many real-world practical 
constraints often impose constraints on the optimization. One example is a 
constant modulus constraint of the form

The reason for this constraint is multifold. For some high power applications, 
it is necessary to run the power amplifiers in so-called saturation (i.e., Class 
C) in order to achieve maximum transmit power efficiency. In other cases, the 
transmitters are incapable of amplitude modulation. In such cases, it would be 
desirable to have an optimization procedure that incorporates (7.64) directly. 
Unfortunately, in general, this can lead to a highly nonlinear problem.
One approximate approach to incorporating the constant modulus con-
straint into the optimization process is via the method of stationary phase, 
which can create a nonlinear frequency modulated (NLFM) pulse (and thus 
constant modulus) with a prescribed magnitude spectrum [12, 19].
Specifically, under fairly general conditions, it is possible to relate instan-
taneous frequency ω of a NLFM waveform to time t, as follows [12, 19]:

where ⎪S(ω)⎪, for example, could represent the magnitude spectrum of an 
optimum pulse obtained from an unconstrained solution to the optimization 
problem. Solving for ω as a function of t in (7.65) yields the frequency modu-
lation that will result in a transmit pulse with a magnitude spectrum equal to 
⎪S(ω)⎪, to within numerical and other theoretical limitations [12, 19].
7.5.3  Nonlinear FM (NLFM) to Achieve Constant Modulus
In this example, we use the method of stationary phase to design a constant 
modulus NLFM pulse that matches the magnitude spectrum of the optimum 
pulse derived for the multipath interference problem previously considered.
Figure 7.17 shows the solution to (7.65); ω versus t, along with the opti-
mum pulse spectrum (long pulse case). Note that as one would intuit, the 
frequency modulation dwells at those frequencies where peaks in the optimum 
pulse spectrum occur; conversely, note the regions in which the modulation 
speeds up to avoid frequencies where the optimum pulse spectrum has nulls 
or lower energy content.
The constant modulus NLFM waveform so constructed was able to 
achieve an output SINR that was within 6.0 dB of optimum, as compared 
with a 24 dB loss using an LFM waveform of same energy and duration.

216	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
It is natural to ask if an NLFM waveform with the same spectral mag-
nitude as the optimum pulse (but not necessarily the same phase) will enjoy 
some (if not all) of the matching gains. For the steady-state case (infinite 
time duration) this is indeed true This is because—from Parseval’s theorem

where Y(ω), H(ω), and S(ω) denote the Fourier transforms of the channel 
output, channel impulse response, and input pulse, respectively. Note that 
the output energy in (7.66) depends on the spectral magnitude of the input 
pulse (steady state)—not the phase. Thus in theory, an NLFM waveform that 
exactly matches the optimum pulse magnitude spectrum will achieve the same 
matching gains in the steady state limit (infinite pulse duration) for all square 
integrable (finite norm) functions.
7.6  Adaptive Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) Radar
Section 7.2 derived the optimal multidimensional transmit-receive (i.e., 
MIMO) design equations that assumed exact knowledge (deterministic and/
or statistical) of the channel (target and interference). However, as those famil-
iar with real-world radar are well aware, channel characterization, in large 
part, must be performed on-the-fly—that is to say, adaptively. This is simply a 
result of the dynamic nature of real-world targets and, especially, interference.
While a plethora of techniques have been developed for radar receiver 
adaptivity, estimating requisite channel characteristics for adapting the trans-
mit function—especially for transmit dependent interference, such as clut-
ter—is a relatively new endeavor. In this chapter, we explore several approaches 
for addressing the adaptive MIMO optimization problem.
In Section 7.6.1, we introduce techniques for the case when the channel 
characteristics are independent of the transmit input—for example, additive 
colored noise jamming. Perhaps not surprisingly—given the transmit inde-
pendence—the channel estimation techniques are essentially those often 
invoked in receive-only adaptivity (e.g., STAP [4]), although the convergence 
properties generally differ.
Section 7.6.2 introduces adaptive MIMO techniques for dynamic chan-
nel probing and estimation. These techniques are indicated for signal dependent 
channel estimation, which potentially includes clutter, targets, and certain 
forms signal-dependent jamming. As will be shown, it is possible to employ 
MIMO channel estimation techniques in such a manner that significant 
estimation performance gains can be achieved compared to non-MIMO 

218	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
estimation [34]. However, once an estimate of the channel is made, the opti-
mum MIMO transmit-receive functions should be employed.
7.6.1  Transmit-Independent Channel Estimation
As mentioned previously, a multitude of techniques have been developed for the 
receiver channel estimation problem for the signal-independent case. A classic 
example is that of additive noise jamming [28]. For the case where no a priori 
knowledge is available, the baseline method of sample covariance estimation 
(and its many variants, such as diagonal loading and principal components 
[4, 35, 36]) is often utilized. In addition to its statistical optimality properties 
(it is the maximum likelihood solution for the i.i.d. additive Gaussian noise 
case [14]), efficient parallel processing implementations have been developed 
facilitating its real-time operation [37].
Figure 7.18 depicts a common procedure for estimating additive, trans-
mit-independent interference statistics. Specifically, the interference covariance 
matrix R ∈ CN×N, is approximated by ˆR ∈C N ×N ,  where
	
ˆR = 1
L
xqxq¢
q∈Ω∑
	
(7.67)
where xq ∈ CN denotes the N-dimensional receive array snapshot (spatial, 
spatiotemporal, etc) corresponding to the qth independent temporal sample 
(e.g., a range or Doppler bin), and L denotes the number of i.i.d. samples 
selected from a suitable set of training samples Ω to form the summation. 
As depicted in Figure 7.18, this training region is often chosen to be close in 
range to the range cell of interest (though there are many variants of this). If, 
moreover, the selected samples are Gaussian and i.i.d., then (7.67) can provide 
the maximum likelihood estimate of R [14]. We illustrate this approach in 
the following example.
7.6.1.1  Adaptive Multipath Interference Mitigation
This is a repeat of the previous multipath interference example, with the 
notable exception of unknown interference statistics that must be estimated 
on-the-fly. As a consequence, an estimate of the covariance matrix is used in 
(7.5) for the whitening filter, rather than the actual covariance as was the case 
in Section 7.2.
Plotted in Figure 7.19 is the overall output SINR loss relative to the 
optimum for the short pulse case as a function of the number of independent

samples used in (7.67). The results shown were based on 50 Monte Carlo trials 
(rms average) with a JNR of 50 dB, and a small amount of diagonal loading 
to allow for inversion when the number of samples is less than 11 (positive 
semidefinite case).
It is interesting to note the rapid convergence and contrast this with 
SINR loss performance for adaptive beamforming—which is generally sig-
nificantly slower. This is due to the fact that we are only estimating the single 
dominant eigenvalue/eigenvector pair. For an authoritative examination of 
principal components estimation and convergence properties, the interested 
reader is referred to [38].
7.6.2  Dynamic MIMO Calibration
Perhaps the earliest instantiation of so-called MIMO radar techniques have 
their origins in transmit antenna array calibration [39, 40]. While techniques 
for estimating the receive array manifold using cooperative or noncooperative 
sources have been in existence for quite some time [39], methods for dynami-
cally calibrating the transmit array manifold (such as active electronically 
scanned arrays (AESAs)) in situ are relatively recent developments [40].
An example of the utilization of MIMO techniques for dynamic calibra-
tion of an AESA radar is depicted in Figure 7.20. Orthogonal waveforms are 
simultaneously transmitted from each transmit-receive (T/R) site of an AESA 
(typically a single subarray AESA). A cooperative receiver then decodes each 
individual signal, calculates the relative phases (or time delays) between the 
transmit elements, and then transmits this information back to the radar. By 
repeating this process for different orientations, a detailed look-up table for 
the transmit steering vectors can be constructed on-board the radar platform. 
This in situ approach is basically a necessity for very large AESAs in space 
since rigidity, which requires mass/weight, would not be sufficient to maintain 
prelaunch, predeployed calibration [40].
7.6.2.1  MIMO Cohere-on-Target
An interesting special case of the above dynamic in situ calibration procedure 
is when transmit “calibration” is performed for a distributed radar focused on 
a single high value target (HVT)—as described by Coutts, et al [41].
Consider Figure 7.21, which depicts an airborne HVT that can be 
detected simultaneously by two geographically disparate radars. Given the 
HVT nature of the target; it is desired to have the two radars work coherently 
in order to maximize the overall SNR at each radar. To achieve on-target 

	
STAP on Transmit

coherency, the two waveforms from each radar need to interfere constructively. 
To accomplish this, however, requires precise knowledge of the transmit path-
ways to a fraction of a wavelength [41]—essentially, a dynamic calibration.
Drawing on MIMO-based calibration concepts, the requisite relative 
time delays between the two radars (as seen by the target) can be estimated by

Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
simultaneously transmitting orthogonal waveforms, which are then detected 
and processed in each radar as follows:
• At each radar, the known one-way time delay to the target is subtracted 
from the total transit time for the sister radar (precise time synchroni-
zation is assumed). The remaining time delay is thus due to the first 
leg of the bistatic path (see Figure 7.21).
• By precompensating a joint waveform in each radar, the two waveforms 
can be made to cohere on the target—resulting in a 3 dB SNR boost 
(ideally). If the above procedure is repeated for N radars, as much as 
a 10logN, dB gain in SNR is theoretically achievable.
While relatively straightforward to describe, the above procedure is 
replete with many real-world difficulties. These include target motion com-
pensation to a fraction of a wavelength and precise phase/timing stability.
As mentioned previously, the orthogonal waveform MIMO radar 
approach can provide a means for adaptively estimating the composite target-
interference channel. This is because the individual input-output responses 
can, under certain circumstances, be resolved simultaneously. However, 
once an estimate of the composite channel is achieved, the optimal MIMO

transmit-receive configuration derived in this chapter should be employed to 
maximize SINR.
7.6.3  Dynamic MIMO Clutter Channel Estimation
Recently, the above ideas have been extended from the use of MIMO [34] 
probing techniques to the estimation of the radar ground [48] clutter chan-
nel [and over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) ionosphere channel]. Air-to-ground 
radar operations over complex terrain, especially urban settings, present great 
challenges to the STAP clutter cancellation function. Most fundamentally is 
the violation of the wide sense stationarity (WSS) assumption required by all 
STAP techniques employing an estimate (explicit or implicit) of the clutter 
covariance (see Chapter 3). It is thus of great interest to find alternative methods 
of clutter channel estimation that can enhance performance. In Chapter 8, we 
introduce knowledge-aided (KA) methods that, for example, use knowledge 
of the terrain coupled with ownship information to aid in predicting clutter 
returns. In this section, we consider yet another technique based on MIMO 
probing. A total clutter channel estimate could thus be formed from a com-
bination of all these methods (see Chapter 8).
Consider a spatial clutter transfer function H for a given range bin of 
interest, for example,
	
H =

H12

(7.68)
where we have, without loss of generality, assumed the same number of trans-
mit and receive channels. When we use a conventional phased array approach 
(i.e., single-input, multiple output or SIMO), we cannot probe the individual 
transmit-receive pathways for each transmitter element—and thus cannot 
fully characterize the clutter channel. However, using a MIMO approach, it 
is possible to do just that.
The associated transmit signal vector s would be of the form

Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
where si, for example, could represent the waveform transmitted out of the ith 
transmitter (see [42–45] for further background on this approach). Thus Hij 
represents the transfer function between jth transmit element (or subarray) 
and the ith receive element in this example. For a basic narrowband station-
ary clutter model, a reasonable approximation is Hij = hijI (i.e., the clutter 
signal does not vary during a pulse—particularly a short one). Pulse-to-pulse 
variation due to relative Doppler will, of course, be allowed, as is normally 
the case for MTI STAP.
Using a receiver structure similar to that utilized by code division mul-
tiple access (CDMA) [43], it is possible to reconstruct estimates of the various 
elements of (7.68). To see how this is possible, consider the output of the ith 
receive channel matched filter tuned to the jth transmit waveform, namely
	
Yij = s j¢zi
= aijs j¢ Hijs j + nri + ni
= aijs j¢ hijI
(
)s j + nri + ni
= aijhij + nri + ni
	
(7.70)
where zi is the received signal at the ith receiver input; nj is the receiver noise 
in the jth receiver channel; α ij is a scalar free-space propagation factor that 
subsumes the transmit power and R4 losses; and nrj is the residue from the 
CDMA processing. Note that if TDMA or FDMA MIMO coding was used, 
this latter noise term would be zero. However, these other techniques have 
their pros and cons, such as sampling the channel at different times (TDMA) 
and frequencies (FDMA)—which may or may not be acceptable depending 
on the application. Note also that we have assumed a perfectly normalized 
matched filter (i.e., s′isi = 1). Any deviation from this would be subsumed into 
α ij.We thus see that, to within a common free space scale factor, the output 
of the ith receiver is a scaled noisy estimate ĥij of the channel elements hij.
Recall from basic STAP theory, an estimate ˆRsm  of the actual interfer-
ence covariance matrix R is generally obtained (explicitly or implicitly) from 
a maximum likelihood (ML) optimization that leads to sample-based covari-
ance of the form
	
ˆRsm = k
xkxk¢
k=1

∑
	
(7.71)

	
STAP on Transmit

where xk denotes the space-time receive array snapshot vector for the kth range 
bin, and K denotes the total number of samples used. A major and fundamen-
tal drawback of this approach is the assumption of statistical stationarity and 
mutual sample independence amongst range-bins [4]. Indeed, the estimate 
from a single range bin is identically rank-one because it is formed by a single 
vector outer product.
To relate (7.71) through (7.70), note that xk has the form
	
xk = Hks + nk	
(7.72)
where Hk is the full dimension transfer function, s is the transmit steering 
vector, xk is the received signal, and nk receiver noise (assumed to be the usual 
stationary white noise both spatially and temporally). Note that this tradi-
tional single-input multiple-output (SIMO) approach only yields a rank one 
measurement of the channel transfer function for a given range bin. This is 
why averaging over multiple range bins is required in order to obtain a full 
rank and ultimately useful estimate of the covariance. From (7.72), we also 
infer the form of the clutter component Rc of the total interference covariance 
matrix, R = Rc + σ 2I, namely Rck = cov(Hks), for the kth range bin.
Note that knowledge of (7.72) is tantamount to knowledge of Rc for the 
stationary case of white noise illumination because
	
Rck = cov Hks
(
)
= cov Hkn
(
)
= E HkHk¢
(
)
	
(7.73)
where n is unity variance white noise, and where for the static clutter case, 
E(HkH′k) = HkH′k.
Of more practical significance, is the fact that knowledge of Hk can be 
used to predict and thus coherently subtract out the clutter interference for the 
kth range bin. Of course, to do this perfectly would require exact knowledge 
of both Hk and δs, neither of which is possible. However, in highly inhomo-
geneous and strong clutter environments, this prefiltering stage can be used 
to detrend the otherwise highly nonstationary clutter series with range index 
[27, 34]. The remaining clutter residue would thus be more statistically sta-
tionary and in turn be more amenable to traditional sample covariance based 
approaches.

226	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
Let δs and δH denote the estimation errors in the transmit steering 
vector s and the clutter transfer function H respectively. The corresponding 
prediction with errors would have the form
	
ˆyi = (H + dH)(s + ds)
= yi + dHs + Hds + dHds
= yi + dyi
	
(7.74)
Making the reasonable assumption that δs and δH are zero mean and 
uncorrelated, the variance in the error δyi is given by
	
var(δyi) = var(δH)s + H var(δs)	
(7.75)
Again, this type of prefiltering (or more precisely de-trending) would only 
be indicated in both strong and highly nonstationary clutter environments, 
but could result in a far more stationary clutter residue that would be more 
amenable to traditional sample covariance estimation techniques.
Problems
1.	 A noncasual impulse response can have non-zero values for negative 
time indices (i.e., h(−k) ≠ 0 for some positive k value). This can arise 
when the impulse response is not associated with time, such as the 
case when k is a spatial index, or for when time samples are processed 
in a batch (buffered) fashion. Rederive the “H” matrix of equation 
(7.2) when the impulse response has values from −M to M.
2.	 Verify that the whitening filter of equation (7.5) (i.e., Hw = R–1/2) 
indeed results in a unity variance diagonal output noise covariance 
(i.e., cov(Hwn) = I) where cov(⋅) denotes the covariance operator. 
(HINT: Hw is not a random variable and thus is unaffected by the 
expectation operator).

Knowledge-Aided (KA) STAP*
8.1	 The Need for KA STAP
What does it mean to be adaptive? A working definition that succinctly covers 
the scope of this book is: An automated system that adjusts its input-output 
characteristics ‘on-the-fly’ to better match its changing environment and mis-
sion profile. By environment, in this context, we of course mean the entire 
radar channel: targets, clutter, jamming, atmosphere, and so on.
Conventional adaptive radar methods date back to the very beginnings 
of radar with, for example, automated gain control (AGC) to prevent receiver 
saturation and cell averaging constant false alarm rate (CACFAR) processing 
to maintain an acceptable false alarm rate [2, 3]. In the decades that followed, 
adaptation was extended to antennas (e.g., sidelobe canceller) for jammer 
mitigation, and spatio-temporal DoFs for enhanced clutter cancellation (i.e., 
STAP) [4–6].
Interestingly, virtually all of these adaptive radar subsystems in mod-
ern radar are based on a single adaptation paradigm: Adjust the input-output 
characteristics of the subsystem based almost solely on the same data stream 
used to extract signals of interest. In the case of jamming, this is, of course, 
*  Portions of this chapter are adapted with permission from [1].

Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
essentially the only way to adapt. This is because there is no way to predict 
when and how a jammer may appear with enough accuracy and precision to 
form a mitigation filter (e.g., antenna null and/or spectral notch). In contrast, 
land clutter is quite a different story.
As anyone who has ever attempted to design a STAP filter to process 
real-world land clutter can attest, it is next to impossible to develop a real-time 
STAP subsystem (of any appreciable size) that can achieve near ideal perfor-
mance in all possible real-world geographical/operational environments [1, 7, 
8]. The root cause of the issue is the need to estimate on-the-fly (i.e., sampled 
radar data) the multidimensional statistics (e.g., covariance) required to form 
a space-time (angle-Doppler) clutter rejection filter. Figure 8.1 depicts several 
primary causes of so-called heterogeneity/non-stationarity, which include [1, 
7, 8]:
• Heterogeneous terrain in the form of variations in topology (e.g., 
mountains) and/or reflectivity (land cover variations, land-sea inter-
faces, etc.), as well as internal clutter motion (ICM) such as windblown 
foliage;
• Large clutter discretes, such as man-made buildings, towers, and power 
lines;
• Road networks that are tantamount to moving clutter (particularly 
problematic for GMTI radars for obvious reasons);
• Nonlinear/inclined arrays and bistatic/multistatic operations that exac-
erbate spectral heterogeneity and the interference subspace-leakage 
(ISL) problem [4];
• Intentional or unintentional electromagnetic interference (EMI).
The above effects, which are generally not mutually exclusive, may result 
in significant spectral and/or statistical nonstationarities that preclude (or 
significantly degrade) purely sample statistics based adaption methods from 
achieving their theoretically prescribed performance achievable under i.i.d. 
conditions [1, 7, 8]. For example, in the case of a STAP subsystem employing 
N spatial and M temporal DoFs, an NM × NM interference-only covariance 
matrix must be estimated (explicitly or implicitly). Even under ideal conditions, 
(i.e., the availability of i.i.d. Gaussian samples), an order of 2NM samples is 
required to ensure an output SINR that is, on average, within 3 dB of the 
theoretical optimum [9] (this can be somewhat relaxed when employing diago-
nal loading or subspace estimation methods such as principal components, 
but the number of requisite samples can still be large relative to the requisite 
stationarity assumption [10, 11]).

	
Knowledge-Aided (KA) STAP

Figure 8.2 illustrates one of the most common methods for selecting 
space-time data samples for estimating the underlying clutter statistics. It is 
predicated on the assumption that the random clutter samples in adjacent range 
cells are i.i.d. with respect to that of a cell under test. If complex Gaussianity is 
further assumed, it can be shown that the sample covariance estimate (matrix 
formed by averaging the sum of data sample outer products) is, in fact, the 
maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the true underlying covariance matrix 
(see Appendix B in Chapter 2). To prevent the so-called “self nulling” prob-
lem, and to ensure independence from the cell under test, several surrounding 
guard cells may be omitted from the training set (as shown in Figure 8.2). This 
step can be relaxed or eliminated altogether if certain precautions—such as 
diagonal loading or principal components—are employed [12].
As an example, the DARPA Mountain Top radar (see Figure 8.3) utilized 
N = 14 spatial and M = 16 temporal DoFs in a coherent processing interval 
(CPI) for a total of NM = 224 space-time DoFs, and its range resolution 
was on the order of about 0.5 km [13]. Thus, for full dimensional STAP (to

achieve maximum theoretical performance), statistical stationarity over 100’s 
of kilometers would be required—clearly a very poor assumption over much 
potential terrain of interest.
While reduced-rank STAP methods can be employed to diminish sample 
support requirements by as much as an order-of-magnitude, at the expense of 
generally a few decibels of theoretical output SINR (see Chapter 5), stationar-
ity of many kilometers is still necessary. This too is all but precluded in many 
overland applications (though obviously not all, such as, say, desert terrain).
One might justifiably ask what the impact of forming sample statistics 
from nonstationary data is. The answer, as it turns out, depends on the nature

of the nonstationary data; however, in general, one or more of the following 
effects may result [4]:
• Over or undernulling of the clutter, particularly in the Doppler regime 
closest to mainbeam clutter (because this is where clutter is strongest);
• Increased false alarms;
• Target signal loss/radar desensitization.
These effects are particularly acute in GMTI radars that place a premium on 
detecting so-called “slow movers” (i.e., minimum detectable velocity (MDV)) 
[4, 14, 15].
Examples of real-world (and thus generally non-stationary) clutter 
abound—indeed, they are the norm rather than the exception. Figure 8.4(a) 
shows a comparison of real clutter data versus Figure 8.4(b), which shows 
clutter data that would have been observed if homogeneous clutter of similar 
average strength were present. Figure 8.5 shows an example real-world clutter 
for a higher resolution experimental X-band system.
In the next section, we introduce the concept of knowledge-aided (KA) 
processing to help alleviate many of the difficulties encountered when attempt-
ing to estimate underlying space-time clutter characteristics over land. While 
we are primarily focused on radar land clutter, the concept of an environmental 
database is readily extensible to many other sensors and applications, such as 
bathymetry for shallow water sonar [17] and IR clutter rejection [18].

Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
8.2	 Introduction to KA Radar: Back to “Bayes-ics”
The origins of radar KA processing as described herein can be traced to the 
pioneering work conducted at the Air Force’s Research Laboratory (AFRL) 
at Rome, New York. Beginning with Expert Systems constant false alarm 
rate (CFAR) [19–22], followed in later years by knowledge-based space-time 
adaptive processing (KB-STAP) [23–28].
From an engineering perspective, an expert system attempts to cap-
ture the experience and judgment of a human subject matter expert (SME) 
in a suitably codified engineered system/algorithm such that (to an outside 
observer) the system response to external stimuli mimics that of an expert. 
This is generally accomplished via some combination of rule-based reasoning 
[29] and/or adaptive algorithmic structures. The idea behind expert systems 
CFAR was to improve upon the sophistication of traditional CFAR techniques 
that typically used some cell averaging approach (such as mean, median, and 
others [30]) based solely on the observed sensor data without the benefit of 
any exogenous environmental awareness.
KB-STAP extended the above ideas to the multidimensional filtering 
problem (CFAR is typically a scalar problem). Traditional STAP is, at its core, 
a sample covariance based technique—and thus, in essence, equivalent to the 
aforementioned traditional CFAR. KB-STAP research greatly expanded the 
potential information sources utilized in the overall adaptation process. An 
early but compelling example of the benefits of adopting a KB-STAP approach 
was developed by Melvin et al. [27]. By using knowledge of where the road

networks (sources of moving clutter) were located in relation to the radar and 
a suitable intelligent training strategy, the velocity desensitization problem 
was circumvented for a real-world airborne radar [27].
While it is essentially a rhetorical question to ask: “Could my adap-
tive radar perform better if it had accurate a priori knowledge of the clutter/
interference environment?”, it is quite another matter to incorporate this prior 
knowledge—in all its varied forms and quality—into a modern real-time 
adaptive radar architecture.
Beginning in 2001, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 
(DARPA) and AFRL formed a partnership to pursue the KASSPER project 
(Knowledge-Aided Sensor Signal Processing and Expert Reasoning). The goal 
was to develop an entirely new real-time KA embedded computing architec-
ture that could accommodate the types of KB/KA algorithms that were being 
developed [31]. While evidence demonstrating the benefits of enhanced envi-
ronmental knowledge gleaned from both endogenous and exogenous sources 
was mounting, a fundamental obstacle remained: the knowledge is contained 
in memory, and thus, in general, is subject to access latencies that can all but 
preclude its integration into a modern pipelined embedded computing archi-
tecture. Section 8.3 below shows how this inherent latency was overcome by 
a noncausal predictive KA coprocessor architecture.
In this section, we will provide an overview of KA STAP, from algorithms 
to a high level overview of real-time high performance embedded comput-
ing (HPEC). As the title of this section implies, the use of prior knowledge is 
certainly not new in signal processing or statistical analysis. Indeed, the well 
celebrated Bayesian approaches are predicated on statistical priors [32]. How-
ever, real-world prior information comes in such a myriad of forms (and not 
usually as a probability density function as prescribed by Bayes), that a variety 
of approaches must be adopted in order to fully exploit it [1, 8].
Algorithmically KA processing (in general) and KA-STAP (in particular) 
can be delineated into so-called indirect and direct methods of incorporat-
ing prior information. In Section 8.2.1, we survey indirect methods, such as 
Intelligent Training and Filter Selection. In Section 8.2.2, we consider some 
examples of direct methods such as Bayesian Filtering and Data Prewhitening.
This is a very dynamic and diverse field that is rapidly evolving at the 
time of this writing. Thus, the treatise herein is by no means complete—but 
rather is aimed at providing the reader with a working sense of the possibilities 
(a problem set is also included at the end of this chapter). Moreover, our focus 
here is on the STAP/CFAR problem, and not on, for example, KA tracking—
which is a rapidly developing sub-field in its own right [33].

Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
8.2.1  Indirect KA STAP: Intelligent Training and Filter Selection
In the Intelligent Training and Filter Selection (ITFS) approach, prior knowl-
edge of the interference environment is used to optimize two adaptive filtering 
processes: (1) the filter selection and (2) the selection of so-called filter train-
ing data (i.e., the selection of data samples used to form a sample covariance 
estimate—either directly or implicitly (e.g., data domain methods) [34]. In 
the case of radar clutter, this could be accomplished by first conducting an 
environmental segmentation analysis based on whatever prior terrain/clut-
ter database is available. Everything from digital terrain and elevation data 
(DTED) to land cover land use (LCLU) to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) 
imagery, or even hyperspectral imagery, can be used [1]. Land clutter tends to 
be clumpy, that is, it tends to be locally similar—but with distinct and often 
abrupt boundaries (for an example, see Figure 8.6). Clearly from physical prin-
ciples, an adaptive filter should not attempt to lump all these regions together 
and apply a single filtering strategy. Instead, a segmentation analysis should 
be performed and an adaptive filter tailored to that region should be applied.
Generally speaking, the filter selection stage determines what type of 
adaptive filter is best suited to a given segmented region. In the case of STAP 
filtering for clutter suppression in radar, a pivotal step is the domain in which 
the actual filtering is performed (e.g., pre- or post-Doppler, element or beam-
space, etc.; see Chapter 5), and the number of adaptive degrees-of-freedom 
(ADoFs)—which manifests itself ultimately in the size of the adaptive filter 
Figure 8.6  Measured range-Doppler returns for the Multi-Channel Airborne Radar 
Measurement (MCARM) data set showing the highly segmented nature of radar clutter 
returns [16].

	
Knowledge-Aided (KA) STAP

(e.g., the size of the sample covariance matrix employed). For example, in the 
case of the principal components (PC) method, the number of adaptive DoFs 
refers to the number of significant eigenvectors to be included in the adaptive 
weight calculation [12]. Similarly for the multistage Weiner filter (MWF), 
the number of stages is the metric for ADoFs [35]. What is critical is that the 
number of ADoFs be matched to the available training data (and, of course, 
the real-time computing architecture). A general rule of thumb that has its 
origins in the RMB result [9] is that there be on order k to 2k i.i.d. samples 
available for training the adaptive weights (e.g., sample covariance estimation), 
where k is the number of effective ADoFs [4]. This result is predicated on the 
assumption that the k dominant eigenvectors are strong relative to the noise 
floor. Indeed for strong enough interference, k linearly independent samples 
(snapshots) completely define the subspace—which is the basis for the Hung-
Turner projection method [36].
Once a basic filtering structure has been selected, a training strategy 
can be selected and optimized for that choice. Basically, all or a subset of the 
samples from the locally stationary region are utilized in the weight training 
stage. In the case of PC, all of the range bins—including the cell under test—
might be included because it has been shown that this approach is robust to 
target cancellation. In contrast, a multibin post-Doppler approach might need 
to take extra care and introduce exclusion and guard cells in order to prevent 
target signal cancellation [6].
Figure 8.7 illustrates the impact that ITFS can have when applied to 
real-world data. As described in [27], the MCARM data set included a number 
of significant highways (i.e., moving clutter). If one simply applied traditional 
sample averaging techniques such as those previously described, one could 
suffer significant detection losses at roadway speeds [27]. Using an intelligent 
training and adaptation scheme that essentially took account of the road net-
works, a significant improvement in detection was achieved.
8.2.1.1  Intelligent Filter Selection: Matching the Adaptive DoFs (ADoFs) to the 
Available Training Data
Consider an airborne, sidelooking MTI radar employing a ULA comprised 
of N = 8 receive antenna elements with half-wavelength spacing, and M = 
16 pulses available for processing in a CPI (see [4] for extensive analyses 
of such systems). Theoretically, a full DOF STAP processor would utilize 
NM = 128 ADoFs that, to first order, would require approximately 100–200 
samples (i.e., range bins) or more depending on the level of diagonal loading 
employed (assuming a sample matrix inverse (SMI) approach). It is not out of 

242	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
the question that this range extent might correspond with many kilometers 
or even tens of kilometers.
At the heart of KA processing is a dynamic environmental database that, 
amongst many possible uses, can be exploited to determine the relative degree 
of stationarity (e.g., clutter homogeneity) over a given region [1, 8]. Unless 
one happens to be flying over flat terrain, such as desert or grasslands, it is 
quite often the case that land clutter is comprised of a variety of regions (e.g., 
roads, buildings, fields, mountains, lakes, etc) [37]. Methods for determining 
the degree of stationarity in a sample data set abound (see for example [27, 
38] and the references cited therein related to the nonhomogeneity detector 
approach (NHD) that has been successfully applied to land clutter).

Assume that we wish to operate our radar (at maximum STAP efficiency) 
over a region for which quasistationarity may only be assumed for about 50 
range bins. Applying the “twice the number of ADoFs rule” for sample sup-
port [4, 6, 11, 39] yields a maximum number of 25 for the allowable ADoFs 
(rank of the STAP filter).
Fortunately, there is a plethora of so-called “reduced-rank” STAP meth-
ods that have been developed over several decades and that can be utilized to 
transform the full DoF STAP filter into a reduced-rank one that meets the 
ADoFs constraint—while often maintaining acceptable SINR loss (see [4, 6, 
39] and references cited therein).
Table 8.1 provides several examples for which the product of the space 
and time ADoFs is less than (or equal to) 25. The top portion of the table is a 
sampling of data-independent rank-reduction methods inasmuch as the num-
ber of spatial and temporal ADoFs does not directly depend on the statistical 
properties of the received data—in contrast to the lower portion of the table 
comprised of data-dependent methods for which the rank, k, will depend on 
the data (e.g., number of principal components and/or MWF stages [35]). For 
these data-dependent methods, an estimate for k (interference subspace rank) 
can be obtained from Brennan’s rule which states that the rank of the clutter 
subspace is approximately given by
	
k ≈N + b(M −1)
⎡⎢
⎤⎥	
(8.1)
where ⎡ ⎤ denotes the ceiling operator (i.e., round-up to the nearest integer), 
and β is a measure of the antenna motion relative to the PRI (i.e., distance, 
measured in half-wavelengths, traversed per PRI [6]). For the case at hand β 
would need to satisfy
	
b ≤25 −N
M −1 = 17
15 	
(8.2)
in order to ensure that enough sample support is available for training purposes.
In practice, k obtained from (8.1) is a bit optimistic; for example, the 
actual clutter subspace rank is generally greater due to a multitude of real-
world effects (such as internal clutter motion (ICM), antenna crabbing, jitter, 
etc.; see Chapter 4). Also the rank for the MWF (measured in the number of 
stages utilized) is generally bounded by (8.1), but may often be less due to its 
steering vector dependency [40].

8.2.2  Direct KA STAP: Bayesian Filtering and Data Prewhitening
In the Bayesian approach to KA-STAP, prior knowledge is incorporated 
directly by the space-time filter in order to aid in adapting to nonstationary 
clutter. A convenient pedagogical framework for this approach is the Bayesian 
covariance estimation approach described by T. W. Anderson [32].
Wishart [41] established that the elements of a sample covariance matrix

obey a Wishart distribution (actually a complex Wishart for the case at hand 
[42]) of degree L (i.e., ˆR W (L ˆR, L).  Fortunately, (8.3) also corresponds 
to the maximum likelihood estimate of the underlying covariance matrix R 
[32, 42].
If a prior estimate of the covariance matrix exists—say ˆR0— it is not 
unreasonable to assume it too is similarly Wishart distributed, particularly if

it was formed over the same geographical region. Moreover, if it is based on 
prior radar observations, then it is also of the form (8.3) (i.e., a sum of data-
sample outer products). The corresponding Bayesian (maximum a posteriori) 
estimate that combines ˆR and ˆR0  is easily derived: let L1 and L0 denote the 
degrees of ˆR and ˆR0  respectively, which are further assumed to be i.i.d. and 
complex Wishart [32]. Then ˆR and ˆR0  are collectively sufficient statistics for 
L0 + L1 i.i.d. samples {xi : i = 1, … L0 + L1}. Thus, the maximum a posteriori 
solution of ˆR  given prior ˆR0  is equivalent to the maximum likelihood solu-
tion based on all of the data {xi : i = 1, … L0 + L1}, [32], for example,
	
ˆR = max

where: f0(R) denotes the prior pdf associated with the prior covariance estimate 
ˆR0  based on L0 samples—and thus is W (L0 ˆR0, L0);  and ˆR1  denotes the 
maximum likelihood (ML) estimate based on L1 samples. (8.4) has an obvious 
intuitive appeal: the a posteriori covariance estimate is formed as a weighted 
sum of the prior and current estimates with weighting factors proportional to 
the amount of data used in the formation of the respective sample covariances.
An obvious yet useful generalization of (8.4) is
	
ˆR = a ˆR0 + b ˆR1
a + b = 1
	
(8.5)
which is the familiar colored loading or blending approach of [43] and [44], 
respectively. The practical advantages of (8.5) relative to (8.4) are many. For 
example, the data used to form the prior covariance might lose its relevance 
with time—the so-called stale weights problem [45]. In that case, even though 
ˆR0  might have been formed from L0 samples, it effectively has less informa-
tion and should be commensurately de-weighted. A common method for 
accomplishing this—borrowed from adaptive Kalman filtering—is the fading 
memory approach in which case α, in (8.5), is

246	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
	
α = e–γtL0	
(8.6)
where t is the time elapsed since the prior covariance estimate was formed, 
and the positive scalar γ is the fading memory constant [46].
In a more general setting, the blending parameters (α,β) could be chosen 
based on the relative confidence in the estimates. For example, ˆR0  could be 
derived from a physical scattering model of the terrain. If this is the case, it is 
also typically of the form (8.3), with the distinction that the outer products 
represent clutter patch steering vectors weighted by the estimated reflectivity 
(see Chapter 3), for example,
	
ˆR0 = 1
Nc
Givivi¢
i=1
Nc∑
	
(8.7)
Nc clutter patches have been utilized in the formation of ˆR0  (typically corre-
sponding to a particular iso-range ring [4, 47]), where vi ∈ CNM is the space-
time (angel-Doppler) steering vector corresponding to the ith clutter patch 
and Gi is its corresponding power [4]. Such information could be available a 
priori from SAR imagery [1, 8] (essentially a high-resolution clutter reflectiv-
ity map) or physics-based models [48].
Though the confidence metric to apply, in the form of the weighting 
parameter α, is difficult to ascribe in practice since the quality of the a priori 
estimate is vulnerable to a number of error sources, a straightforward remedy 
is to choose α adaptively so as to maximally whiten the observed interference 
data [49]. For example:

bin; a ˆR0 + b ˆR1
(
)
−1/2  is the whitening matrix corresponding to a particular α 

	
Knowledge-Aided (KA) STAP
247
(with β = 1 − α); yi is the vector residue with dim(yi) = dim(xi); and the sum-
mation in (8.9) is performed over a suitable subset of the radar observations, 
for which ˆR0  is believed valid. If an a priori covariance estimate is available 
for each range bin, then the vector residue (8.10) can be replaced with
	
yi = a ˆR0(i) + b ˆR1
(
)
−1/2 xi 	
(8.11)
where ˆR0(i)  is the a priori estimate for the ith range bin.
The above adaptive α approach is but a special case that is part of an 
entire class of direct filtering methods incorporating prior information. In a 
more general setting, the space-time vector residues, {yi}, can be viewed as a 
de-trended vector time series using prior knowledge in the form of a covari-
ance based whitening filter. The major potential advantage of this is to remove 
(or attenuate) the major quasideterministic trends in the data (e.g., clutter 
discretes, mountains, etc.) so that the resulting residue vector time series is 
less nonstationary or inhomogeneous, and thus more amenable to traditional 
sample covariance based approaches.
An interesting example of this can be found in [16]. In this prewhiten-
ing example, a CLEAN algorithm was applied to the APTI data set of Figure 
Figure 8.8  Results of applying the prewhitening approach. Note the significant 
reduction in the so-called “clutter tails” in the log exceedance plot [16].

4.7(a), resulting in the discrete map of Figure 4.7(b). A deterministic covari-
ance [47] was then formed as in (8.7), from which a square root whitening 
filter matrix could be derived. Figure 8.8 shows a log exceedance plot of the 
difference between the unwhitened data and the prewhitened data. Note the 
presence of spiky clutter as evidenced by the so-called “fat-tails” in the unwhit-
ened data, and its subsequent reduction when employing direct KA methods.
8.2.2.1  Using Past Observations as a Prior Knowledge Source
Perhaps the simplest form of a knowledge environmental database can be 
created from previous scans over a given geographical region. Indeed the 
preponderance of multipass SAR systems, including coherent change detec-
tion (CCD) methods [50], provides an extremely rich knowledge source for 
an environmental clutter database [14]. Inevitably, however, there will likely 
be some amount of decorrelation between the prior measurements and the 
current received radar signals due to a variety of factors including, but by no 
means limited to, geo-registration errors, sensor orientation differences, inter-
nal clutter motion, and array manifold mismatches.
A convenient mechanism for modeling vector random variable decor-
relation is the covariance matrix tapering (CMT) approach [45], as discussed 
at length in Chapter 4. Specifically, an NM dimensional complex multivari-
ate RV with associated original covariance R ∈ ℂNM×NM, that has undergone 
a decorrelating process, can simply be described as
	
ˆR0 = R  T ∈NM ×NM 	
(8.12)
where ˆR0  is the covariance matrix that results from a decorrelating process 
characterized by the CMT T ∈ ℂNM×NM, which in general is a positive semi-
definite (and conformal) matrix [45]. From the Schur Product Theorem, ˆR0  
is guaranteed to be positive definite if R is positive definite and T is at least 
positive semidefinite [51].
Due to real-world clutter nonstationarity and the desire to minimize the 
sample support required to estimate the requisite sample covariance matrix 
(implicitly or explicitly), we would like to take advantage of the prior informa-
tion in the form of a decorrelated estimate of the true underlying covariance 
(i.e., ˆR0  from (8.12)). Let us assume that the primary source of decorrelation 
is due to range walk, which could be caused by a slight misalignment of the 
sensor range bin grid (see Chapter 4). In this case, the CMT is of the form
	
T = Ttime ⊗ 1N×N	
(8.13)

	
Knowledge-Aided (KA) STAP
249
where ⊗ denotes the matrix Kronecker product [51], 1N×N denotes the Had-
amard identity matrix (unity elements), and the temporal CMT, Ttime ∈ 
ℂM×M, is given by

(8.14)
where the correlation coefficient, 0 < ρ < 1, captures the degree of decorrela-
tion between the current and prior data.
If we denote the current and prior sample covariance estimates by ˆR0  
and ˆR  respectively, we would like to form a Bayesian-like estimate along the 
lines of (8.4) and (8.5), for example,
	
ˆRKA = a ˆR0 + (1−a) ˆR 	
(8.15)
where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 is a suitably chosen blending parameter. If there was no 
decorrelation between the prior data and the current measurements (i.e., they 
represented i.i.d. samples from the same underlying Gaussian (clutter) distri-
bution), then one could invoke the exact Bayesian solution of (8.4). However, 
due to real-world decorrelating effects, the effective amount of prior data L0eff 
will generally be less than L0, leading to the inequality
	
a ≤
L0
L0 + L1
	
(8.16)
where L1 denotes the number of i.i.d. samples used to form the current sample 
covariance, per (8.4).
For the special case where L0 = L1, (8.16) implies that in general α ≤ 1/2, 
unless (of course) ρ in (8.14) is unity (i.e., no decorrelation), in which case α 
should be set equal to 0.5 for the optimal Bayes’s estimate.
An interesting question is thus: given the amount of decorrelation as 
described by the CMT of (8.14), how can one choose the effective number of 
samples (and thus α)? An approximate answer can be obtained by computing 
relative SINR loss versus ρ in (8.14) and equating it with the Reed, Mallet, 
Brennan (RMB) rule [9], which is given by

250	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
	
SINRLoss = L −NM + 2
L +1
,  L ≥NM 	
(8.17)
where L denotes the number of i.i.d. complex Gaussian samples. For example, 
if ρ in (8.14) results in a 5 dB loss in predicted SINR (relative to optimum), 
it is (from (8.17)) effectively equivalent to a sample covariance comprised of 
approximately 1.33NM samples (assuming NM is relatively large). Assum-
ing that 2NM samples were originally used to form ˆR0,  we see that—due to 
decorrelating effects—the number of effective samples (effective weighting) 
has been discounted by about 34%.
To illustrate the above observations, consider an airborne sidelooking 
MTI radar utilizing an N = 16 ULA (half wavelength element spacing operat-
ing in the far field), and M = 16 pulses in a coherent processing interval (CPI). 
Assume that β = 1, and that the CNR is 40 dB. Plotted in Figure 8.9 are four 
cases: relative SINR loss versus Doppler for the ideal case (exact covariance 
case); the prior covariance is utilized but with a decorrelation due to range 
walk corresponding to ρ = 0.80 (corresponds to about a 5–7 dB SINR loss);

only NM samples of the current data is used (no priors) resulting in nearly a 
30 dB loss (no diagonal loading); and the current estimate is blended with the 
prior estimate that has been discounted based on (8.17). Note that suitably 
blending the prior estimate even though it has undergone decorrelation can 
still yield a better estimate of the current covariance matrix—illustrating one 
of the basic benefits of KA processing.
In the next section, we address the seemingly daunting challenge of 
incorporating prior knowledge—an inherently memory intensive process—
into a high performance embedded computer.
8.3	 Real-Time KA-STAP: The DARPA/AFRL KASSPER 
Project
Over the years, ingenious real-time computing architecture solutions have 
been devised to implement the sample matrix-based (maximum likelihood) 
STAP solutions in real-time flight hardware [34]. In particular, to achieve the 
enormous throughput burden of a modern multichannel STAP radar, highly 
parallel HPEC systems based on so-called data domain reformulations of the 
Figure 8.10  An example of a computer array implementing a data domain 
reformulation of the sample matrix based Weiner-Hopf equation (see [52]).

252	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
Weiner-Hopf equation have been devised [8, 9]. Figure 8.10 shows one such 
architecture based on a QR-factorization solution to the Weiner-Hopf equa-
tions [52].
With such architectures, tens to hundreds of Giga floating point opera-
tions (GFLOPs) of real-time computing power (or greater) can be achieved in 
hardware that can fit on an airborne radar aircraft [53]. Though the marvels 
of modern technology, these machines are cyber savants; they can solve the 
Wiener-Hopf equations at blinding speeds in a strict pipelined fashion but 
grind to a snail’s pace if the data flow is disrupted for nonpipelined operations. 
This is a major fundamental obstacle in implementing knowledge-aided or 
generalized Bayesian approaches that are inherently memory intensive (prior 
information needs to be stored and retrieved) [1]. Figure 8.11 shows the order-
of-magnitude time scales for accessing different memory storage devices. 
Thus, in order to create a real-time knowledge-aided HPEC (KA-HPEC, 
pronounced “K-PEC”) architecture, a major breakthrough in memory man-
agement must be achieved. This is because much of the prior information (e.g., 
terrain maps, road networks, discrete maps, etc.) will reside on mass storage 
(and thus slow) media.

storage media (Source: Dr. D. Patterson, Graduate Computer Architecture Course,

8.3.1  Solution: Look-Ahead Scheduling
The key KA-HPEC breakthrough in the DARPA KASSPER project is based 
on a basic fundamental insight:
There is a significant degree of determinism—and thus predictability—to 
radar clutter returns, particularly if the prediction horizon is only on the order 
of seconds.
For example, let t0 denote the present time of a postulated airborne radar. 
Let t0 + δt denote a time slightly in the future—say δt = 1 second. Then in 
practice, the following are true:
1.	 The location of the aircraft at t0 + δt can be predicted to a very 
high degree of accuracy—assuming that no radical maneuvering is 
occurring.
2.	 The future state of the radar (e.g., look-direction, frequency, PRF, 
etc.) at t0 + δt is also known to a very high degree of accuracy, 
except perhaps for the most extreme of circumstances—in which 
case, the operator is likely to have much bigger problems than clut-
ter nonstationarity.
The justification for the first assertion is simply that, given the full kine-
matic state vector of the aircraft (position, speed, heading, etc.), Newtonian 
mechanics insures fairly deterministic behavior—particularly for just a few 
seconds into the future. Justification for the second assertion arises from the 
simple fact that modern airborne radar systems utilize a radar scheduler [54]. 
Since the radar is computer controlled, it must have a tasking schedule. The 
scheduler is generally highly deterministic when considering a future time 
horizon on the order of seconds.
Why are the above assertions so critical to solving the posed memory 
access problem? Answer: they allow for look-ahead scheduling. More specifi-
cally, they allow for noncausal processing, whose prediction horizon is com-
mensurate with the memory access delays. To see how this can be exploited 
by a KA-HPEC architecture, consider Figure 8.12. In this instantiation, a 
noncausal look-ahead computer is running in parallel with a conventional 
causal STAP HPEC processor. The noncausal processor is used to spot trouble 
before it occurs, and perform the necessary memory retrieval and precom-
putations to ensure that the right weight modification scheme is ready to go 
when the data appear.
Figure 8.13 shows the MIT Lincoln Laboratory KASSPER HPEC sys-
tem, a real-time 96 node parallel processing architecture implementing the

determinism with look-ahead time-scales on the order of seconds. The noncausal 
processor, running in parallel with a more conventional HPEC STAP processor, is used 
to look-ahead and detect regions of the radar field of regard requiring knowledge-aided 
processing.

noncausal look-ahead scheduling scheme of Figure 8.12 [27]. The system is 
capable of receiving real-time in-phase and quadrature (I&Q) digitized sam-
ples from multiple receive channels over the full range extent of a radar and 
implementing a variety of KA algorithms throughout the entire radar signal 
processing chain from STAP to CFAR.
When it comes to real-time HPEC the devil is most certainly in the 
details! Figure 8.14 gives the basic gist of how the look-ahead scheduling is 
implemented. As the aircraft moves, a sliding window of data is migrated from 
a mass storage medium (e.g., disk drives) to a more readily accessible location 
(e.g., RAM). Depending on the particulars of the radar tasking, a first-pass 
decision is made as to what regions require knowledge-aided processing. For 
example, if the radar is scheduled to point in a direction where a major road 
network is known to exist, essential details regarding this road network (ori-
entation, range extent, etc.) are extracted and exploited in potentially several 
stages of the radar signal processing chain. Given the look-ahead time buffer, 
this is all accomplished prior to the actual radar event. The exact extent of the 
sliding window depicted in Figure 8.14 depends (of course) on the particular 
radar parameters (min/max range, altitude, etc.).
8.3.1.1  Balancing Throughput in a KASSPER HPEC Architecture
Assume it is desired to upgrade a conventional STAP architecture capable of 
100 GFLOPs (pipelined) throughput to a KA-STAP configuration. However, 
due to both budgetary and form-factor constraints, only an additional 10 
GFLOPs of real-time processing and 4 Gbytes of high performance RAM 
can be added to the front-end. We will assume that the addition of mass stor-
age (e.g., RAID) is not a problem, as it can reside elsewhere on the platform. 
Figure 8.14  Illustration of the environmental database manipulation illustrating the 
sliding window approach to migrating data from mass storage to RAM and ultimately to 
cache.

256	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
This latter assumption allows for a very large dynamic environmental database 
containing both a priori data and data gleaned during flight.
As shown in Figure 8.15, this upgrade is tantamount to introducing an 
environmental dynamic database (EDDB)—subsystem A , a KA coprocessor 
B  that communicates with the database (bidirectionally), the conventional 
STAP processor C , the radar scheduler D , and the ownship location system 
E  (e.g., INS). Basically, the KA coprocessor B  looks ahead by determining 
where the radar will be (from E ) and where it will pointingas well as what 
it will be transmitting—all information available from the scheduler D . 
The coprocessor B  then scans through the EDDB A , identifying potential 
problem areas and computing the requisite modifications (e.g., training data 
segmentation, colored loading, etc.).
To make this example a bit more definitive, we will further assume that 
the bulk of the computational burden in the KA coprocessor B  is assigned to 
computing statistics such as the sample covariance matrix—somewhat similar 
to the types of computations performed in the conventional STAP processor 
C . Clearly, since B  has only one-tenth the compute power of C , it could 
not possibly process all of the data in the EDDB. This leads naturally to one

of the key features of the EDDB: database element tags that allow for quick 
scanning and identification of potential problem areas. These elemental features 
could include reflectivity, type of surface (including presence or absence of 
buildings and/or roads, etc.), and topology. The point being that a quick scan 
by the KA coprocessor C  could identify and rank-order potential problem 
areas—then compute the relevant statistical information to be used in the 
conventional STAP processor B .
Let ∆R denote the range extent that the conventional STAP processor B  
can process in real-time. This naturally leads to the first throughput constraint 
on the KA coprocessor C  when, as we have assumed, the computations are 
of a similar type to B ,
	
∆RKA ≤ 0.1∆R	
(8.18)
where ∆RKA denotes the amount of range extent that the KA coprocessor can 
process in real-time. Equation (8.18) is merely a reflection of the obvious fact 
that if C  has only one-tenth the compute power of B , then to first order it 
can only process at most one-tenth the amount of data as B .
The next design issue is how far into the future does the KA coprocessor 
need to look? The answer to this question is driven by the latency associated 
with loading the results from the KA coprocessor C  into the conventional 
STAP processor B . Though a precise answer to this question is inextricably 
dependent on the details of the HPEC system, a look-ahead on the order of 
seconds is typically more than sufficient. Fortunately, this amount of look-
ahead is very easily achieved because both ownship future location and radar 
schedule are all but deterministic on these time scales. For simplicity, we will 
assume a look-ahead requirement of one second.
If each element of the EDDB corresponds to a 1m2 patch of ground and 
the range of extent for the radar is 200 km with min-max ranges (rmin, rmax) 
of 10 to 210 km, respectively, then for each pulse and/or CPI, the amount of 
area A to be examined by the KA coprocessor is on the order of
	
A ≈4p rmax
2
−rmin
2
(
) = 263 million m2 	
(8.19)
which, in turn, implies that on order of 263 million database elements need 
to be examined on a continuous (real-time) basis.
Assuming that each database element consists of 128 bits (reflectivity, 
elevation, cover type, etc.), the above corresponds to approximately 34 Gbytes 

258	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
of storage. Since this data would need to reside in fast-access RAM in order 
to be processed by the KA coprocessor, we see that there is a problem because 
we have only been allocated 4 GBytes of RAM in the upgrade.
The simplest and most practical remedy is to rank order each element 
offline or in the background based on known deleterious characteristics. For 
example, EDDB elements associated with large discretes of sufficient reflectivity 
to cause false alarms would have a high priority, while elements embedded in 
a homogenous background would rank low or be culled altogether. Thus, to 
first order, 4/34 or approximately 12% of the land clutter could be processed 
using KA methods—in one form or another. In an operational setting, there 
may often be hot spots or areas of particular interest; therefore 12% might 
be sufficient.
8.3.2  Examples of a KA Architectures Developed by the DARPA/AFRL 
KASSPER Project*
A number of researchers participated in the DARPA/AFRL KASSPER proj-
ect and developed a number of successful KA methods and architectures. 
The interested reader is encouraged to consult the literature and references 
cited, particularly the proceedings of the KASSPER workshops [31] for fur-
ther details. While a number of KA algorithms and architectures have been 
developed and demonstrated, we will highlight the particular KA STAP 
instantiation developed by Information Systems Laboratories (ISL), Inc. [55].
Figure 4.16 shows a high level component diagram of ISL’s KA STAP 
(IKA-STAP) architecture adopted from [55]. In addition to the EDDB 
(upper left hand corner of figure), the architecture is seen to consist of a KA 
coprocessor (top shaded region) and the conventional STAP processing chain 
(bottom shaded region). Note that the KA coprocessor communicates with 
the target tracker to facilitate various blanking operations. Communication 
paths with the radar scheduler and ownship INS system are not shown in 
Figure 8.16.
As evidenced by the KA coprocessor delineation into mainlobe/sidelobe 
discretes and distributed clutter, the IKA-STAP architecture incorporates 
special processing for optimum clutter discrete handling as well as distrib-
uted clutter cancellation [55]. In particular, five distinct clutter mitigation 
elements are incorporated [55]: 1) Colored loading for distributed clutter; 2) 
Colored loading for mainbeam discrete clutter; 3) Colored loading for sidelobe 
* The author is indebted to Jamie Bergin and Paul Techau, ISL, Inc., and William Melvin, et al., 
GTRI, the developers of the architectures described in this section.

discrete clutter; 4) Land cover-based training data editing; and 5) Iterative 
target editing.
Colored loading [43], as the name implies, is an additive blending of 
sample covariance estimates derived from both online and KA sources. In 
particular, the colored loading covariance estimate ˆRKA−CL  employed in the 
IKA-STAP architecture is of the form [55]
	
ˆRKA−CL = ˆRSM + bKA ˆRKA + bDLI 	
(8.20)
where ˆRSM  is a sample covariance based estimate derived from the online 
measurement data, ˆRKA is a purely knowledge-based estimate, and (β KA, β DL) 
are positive scalar blending parameters associated with the KA covariance 
estimate and conventional diagonal loading. Note that but for the additional 
diagonal loading term, (8.20) is of the form found in (8.5). It should be noted 
that while we are using a power domain or direct covariance representation 
approach to simplify the analysis, data domain representations employing QR 
factorizations are readily implementable. See Chapter 6, which shows how 
to append additional additive (and even Hadamard multiplicative, such as a 
CMT) terms to the STAP data cube used for sample covariance estimation.
For the GMTI application considered in the IKA-STAP architecture 
development, the main culprits contributing to deleterious conventional 
STAP performance were mainlobe and sidelobe discretes and abrupt clutter 
region changes (boundary interfaces). Once these effects were identified and

Systems Laboratories, Inc., under the DARPA/AFRL KASSPER project.

accounted for, the remaining whitened clutter statistics were fairly benign, 
and were thus amenable to conventional sample covariance and diagonal 
loading methods [4].
In the case of mainbeam discretes (which, by definition, have high signal 
strength relative to noise), it is possible to directly identify and estimate requi-
site color loading parameters [55]—as illustrated in Figure 8.17. It consists of 
forming a quasi-SAR (range-Doppler) map matched, thresholding the image 
to allow only large returns around zero Doppler, and then forming augmen-
tation steering vectors to the colored loading covariance. Note that the both 
tracker data and a priori EDDB entries aid in ensuring that real targets are not 
misidentified and that a discrete is declared with high confidence. The result 
is a KA covariance that has deeper nulls than would otherwise be the case.
Figure 8.18 shows the subsystem for addressing large sidelobe discretes 
that can show up as false targets. Both a priori knowledge from a variety of 
environmental databases—along with the data gathered from the mainbeam 
scheme described above—provide a rich basis for predicting when and where 
(range-Doppler-angle) a sidelobe discrete is likely to arise. While sidelobe 
blanking methods could be readily implemented [52], a more sophisticated 
technique was implemented in IKA-STAP wherein a suitable preprocessed 
snapshot vector known to contain the sidelobe discrete was added to the 
covariance estimate via colored loading (see [55] for details). This allowed 
for the detection of targets (unlike blanking) in the range swath known to 
be vulnerable to sidelobe clutter discretes. Interestingly, the null-on-transmit 
technique described in Chapter 7 is potentially an even more effective tech-
nique, as the offending clutter discrete is effectively removed from the receiver 
processing chain.

clutter discretes and incorporate KA corrections via colored loading [55].

Also contained in the IKA-STAP architecture is the provision for land 
cover-based training data editing—that is, the use of terrain maps to determine 
regions of relative homogeneity and abrupt boundaries. Figure 8.19 illustrates 
how such maps can be projected into the radar’s field of view in order to 
determine how best to segment the training data (see [55] for further details).

problem [55]. In this example, land cover maps are projected into the radar’s field of 
view in order to determine an optimum training data selection strategy.

262	
Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
Finally, a KA iterative method is employed to ensure that actual target returns 
are excluded from the training data in order to avoid desensitization [55].
Figure 8.20 shows the results of applying the IKA-STAP architecture to 
the sixth KASSPER data challenge set [55]. Note that mainbeam and sidelobe 
clutter discretes have been eliminated, with a significantly reduced clutter resi-
due overall and at the difficult land-sea interface (see [55] for further details 
regarding the underlying data set). Also contained in [55] are the results of 
applying IKA-STAP to recorded flight test data further establishing its efficacy.
Also developed under the auspices of the DARPA/AFRL KASSPER 
project was the GTRI KA-STAP (GKA-STAP) architecture shown in Figure 
8.21, designed by researchers at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) 
[7, 56]. While there are many complex elements to the overall architecture 
that we will not delve into in this forum, the reader is directed to the two-
stage KA prefilter that effectively detrends the nonstationary aspects of the 
incoming multichannel data stream based on a number of knowledge sources 
as indicated (cultural database information, ownship position, calibration 
information, etc.) [57]. Figure 8.22 shows the corresponding performance of 
Figure 8.20  Application of the IKA-STAP architecture to the sixth KASSPER challenge 
data set [55]. Conventional STAP (left figure) results in significant clutter leakage and 
sidelobe discrete targets, while IKA-STAP essentially eliminates all complex clutter 
issues.

several variants of the GKA-STAP approach as compared with conventional 
STAP when applied to the KASSPER #2 challenge data set [57].
Yet another interesting KA architecture developed under the auspices of 
the KASSPER project utilized a physics-based approach to essentially estimate 
the parameters of all of the scatterers (targets and/or clutter) observable over 
some coherent processing interval [48]. Though very computationally intensive 
relative to conventional STAP (or the IKA or GKA architectures above), it is 
nonetheless extremely illuminating, as it clearly shows the significant potential 
of a radar to precisely measure its environment.
Though the reader is referred to [48] for precise details, essentially the 
KA Signal and Clutter as Highly Independent Structured Modes (SCHISM 
) algorithm is fundamentally an estimation-subtraction approach similar to 
the CLEAN algorithm [58]—that is, as stronger modes are estimated, they 
are coherently subtracted from the CPI data cube. The process is then repeated 
ideally until the residue coincides with the radar noise floor (in practice this 
is only approximately achieved).
Figure 8.21  Illustration of the GTRI KA-STAP (GKA-STAP) architecture developed 
under the DARPA/AFRL KASSPER workshop. Though there a number of complex 
processing elements, the diagram clearly illustrates the central role that knowledge 
plays in detrending the nonstationary aspects of the incoming multichannel 
interference. Knowledge sources illustrated include cultural databases, ownship 
position information, and other calibration knowledge [57].

Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
More precisely, over the coherent processing interval (CPI), M complex 
time samples are collected for each of N spatial channels. Suppose the space 
and time samples are uniformly spaced ∆x and ∆t apart, respectively. The 
measured signal at the (n,m)-th space-time sample can be modeled as
	
yn,m(A,k,w) ≡

(8.22)
where Ap is the complex amplitude of the pth structured (target or clutter) sig-
nal component; κ p is the spatial frequency associated with a plane wavefront 
arriving at a beam angle, θp, relative to broadside; ωp is the temporal frequency 
associated with a Doppler frequency, fp; and vn,m is the measurement noise. A 
point jammer is modeled with M or fewer strong Doppler frequencies from 
a single beam direction.

Doppler STAP approach EFA. Note that all of the KA methods significantly outperform 
conventional STAP.

	
Knowledge-Aided (KA) STAP

Application of the above SCHISM algorithm results in a scatter map 
for all targets, clutter, and/or moving targets, as shown in Figure 8.23. Scat-
terers that are sufficiently separated from the angle-Doppler clutter ridge are 
declared moving targets. Also shown in Figure 4.23 are the results before and 
after array manifold calibration.
What is particularly intriguing about the SCHISM approach is that it 
produces a high resolution range-Doppler image that rivals traditional SAR 
imagery, but with a far shorter dwell time. Moreover, because it does not 
utilize a sample covariance matrix, clutter discretes are readily detectable. 
Consequently, even if SCHISM could not be implemented for every CPI in 
real-time, it could be used intermittently to populate the large clutter discrete 
portion of the EDDB database.
8.4	 KA STAP Epilogue
A common misconception for those first encountering KA methods is that 
somehow only a priori knowledge—such as digital terrain databases [59]—
is being used. Clearly, this is not the case. Rather, a judicious blending of 
Figure 8.23  Sample outputs from physic-based KA SCHISM algorithm as applied 
to the original KASSPER challenge data set before (a) and after (b) array manifold 
calibration. By utilizing an underlying physics model, rather than a purely statistical 
sample covariance approach, individual scatterers (targets and clutter discretes) are 
readily discernible. Such data can, in turn, be used to populate the EDDB.

Space-Time Adaptive Processing for Radar
exogenous and endogenous data sources that draws on the relative strengths 
of each is the most effective. Both the IKA-STAP and GKA-STAP examples 
clearly illustrate this point. The key to KA processing is that knowledge—
however it was obtained—is allowed to exist in a dynamical database (i.e., the 
EDDB) that can be exploited in real-time. The look ahead HPEC architecture 
developed under the KASSPER project enables this approach.
Problems
1.	 For the idealized N = M = 16 sidelooking, β = 1, CNR = 40 dB, 
ULA STAP problem considered in Chapter 3 (no crab or other ISL 
effects), which of the following discrete steering vectors is most likely 
to leak through the STAP filter due to undernulling if the discrete is 
very large relative to the background CNR? Why? The assumption is 
that this discrete was not in the training data. Discrete #1: 1M ⊗ 1N 
or Discrete #2: b ⊗ 1N, where 1L denotes a vector of L ones, and b is 
a Doppler steering vector corresponding to a normalized Doppler of 
0.05. HINT: Carefully study Figure 3.9 in Chapter 3.
2.	 In Chapter 2 (and elsewhere), it was shown that a suitable amount 
of diagonal loading can result in performance commensurate with 
a higher effective amount of training data. Assuming that a chosen 
diagonal loading results in an effective doubling of the available train-
ing data, what is the impact to Table 8.1—assuming all else remains 
the same?
3.	 Assume the existence of two independent complex Wishart covari-
ance estimates ˆR1 W (L1R, L1) and ˆR2 W (L2R, L2);  however, 
due to real-world decorrelating effects, ˆR2  has effectively 20% less 
samples. What would be the resulting relative weighting in the linear 
combiner of (8.5)?
4.	 Assume that the angle (relative to boresight) of a large clutter discrete 
is known a priori, and that its CNR is 40 dB (relative to the noise 
floor). We wish to form a receive null deterministically, which from 
(2.59) would result in a filter weight vector of the form
	
w = s −

where we have assumed that the clutter discrete is much stronger than the 
receiver noise floor. In practice, even though the angle to the discrete is know 
perfectly, slight unknown errors in the receive array manifold result in an 
imperfect estimate of the corresponding discrete spatial steering vector (i.e., 
vc → vc + δv); for convenience, we will assume the errors are independent 
and complex Gaussian. Plot the resulting output SINR as a function of the 
variance in the array manifold error (either numerically via a Monte Carlo 
simulation or analytically). This problem illustrates a fundamental difficulty 
in implementing direct filtering KA techniques. Fortunately, due to the semi-
nal work of Melvin et al. [60], practical techniques for estimating the array 
manifold have been developed that yield excellent results.
