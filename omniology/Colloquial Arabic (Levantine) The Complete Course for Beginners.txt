INTRODUCTION
Arabic is the language of daily communication for between 150 and
200 million people, and the language of worship for many hundreds
more millions of Muslims. It is the original language of the Koran,
which in Muslim belief is incomparably excellent, since it is the
direct word of God (kalaam allaah). Arabic is the language of prayer
for all Muslims, and the language of the muezzin who summons the
faithful to prayer the world over five times daily. It is now an official
working language in the UN and many international agencies. Its
script is used in many other languages—Persian, Ottoman Turkish
and Urdu among them—and since the Koran is possibly the world’s
best selling book the Arabic script may well be the second most
used script after Latin. The Arabic written language is almost
completely uniform throughout the Arab world. Moreover the
language of radio and television is uniform to the same extent, since
it is simply the written word of modern Arabic being read aloud.
There is a direct line of descent from classical Arabic, the language
of the Koran, to modern Arabic; so that across 1,400 years (in the
Islamic calendar) the script is recognizably the same, the grammar has
changed remarkably little (by comparison with, for example, German
or English) and even the vocabulary has shown an astonishing integrity
and consistency. It is the Koran which has preserved the essence of
written Arabic, and it is also the elevated status accorded to the
original language of Islam which has prevented the Arabic dialects
from becoming as far apart from each other as the dialects of Latin.
Whereas Italian and French are not now mutually comprehensible,
the speakers of dialects of Arabic over an enormous area can
understand each other. Peasants from Muscat and Morocco

INTRODUCTION

respectively would certainly have problems with each other’s dialects,
but even peasants and certainly educated people throughout the
Peninsula, the Levant, Iraq, Egypt, the Sudan and some parts of N.
Africa can make themselves understood to each other without
necessarily resorting to classical Arabic.
Within the Levant (historical Syria, Jordan and Lebanon) there is,
if not linguistic homogeneity, at least clearly visible evidence of close
similarity between the many dialects. The differences are what one
would expect. A Sidon (Lebanon) fisherman will use different
metaphors from those of a Syrian from the Jebel Druze; because of
close community ties over long historical periods villages tend to
preserve distinctive features of vocabulary and phonology. *
This introductory manual aims to present those features of the
language which would be acceptable throughout the Levant area.
The speech presented is not, on the one hand, the dialect of any
particular village or area; nor is it, on the other, a debased classical
form spoken by no one in particular. The aim is to present a natural
form of speech, which is acceptable and at the same time idiomatic
and correct.
An Arabic proverb says ‘A new language is a new man’ and, among
other things, this means that a non-Arab approaching Arabic has to
be ready to understand (if not necessarily to imitate) different attitudes
and perspectives. Westerners are not in everyday speech given, as
Arabs are, to quoting poetry, ancient proverbs and extracts from holy
books. Nor are they wont to exchange fulsome greetings. This is to
say nothing of the different attitudes to physical contact and proximity,
as well as to relations between the sexes. It is, however, essential to
understand not only the grammar and vocabulary of the Arabic of
this area but also the underlying attitudes and assumptions.
Perhaps the greatest difference between the Levantine approach
to language and that of westerners is that Levantines, like most Arabs,
take pleasure in using language for its own sake.** The sahra (or
evening entertainment) may well take the form of talk alone, but
*This is after all the area which gave the world the concept of a shibboleth, and
this same feature (s/sh) still distinguishes Levant dialects from each other (sajara/
shajara; tree).
**But in a way totally different from other Arabic speakers: five minutes on the
streets of Cairo reveal attitudes to life and language totally different from those of
Syria.

INTRODUCTION
3
talk of a kind forgotten in the west except in isolated communities
such as Irish villages or Swiss mountain communities—talk not merely
comical, tragical, historical/pastoral, etc but talk ranging over poetry,
story-telling, anecdotes, jokes, word-games, singing and acting. It is
no accident that Arabic has a verb which means ‘to chat to someone
in the evening’ and that a common name is Samir (f. Samira) meaning
‘one with whom one chats in the evening’. The moral for the non-
Arab is that if one can adjust to these different attitudes to language,
and understand what is going on, one can discover whole layers of
Arab life which must remain unsuspected to those who know no
Arabic or who, knowing some, remain attached to (for example) the
belief that only classical Arabic is a fit object of study. The present
writer takes the view that a real understanding and appreciation of
colloquial Arabic can only expand a student’s knowledge of classical
Arabic. A student who understood all the allusions to poetry, proverbs
and religion to be heard on a day’s march in the Levant would be far
beyond doctoral standards in terms of university study. *
This manual attempts to give some insight into aspects of colloquial
Arabic other than syntax and vocabulary: in addition to twelve lessons
on these subjects there are lessons on idioms, greetings, ritual language,
terms of address and reference, proverbs, even on abuse. A multi-
media approach would be necessary to do justice to a communicative
approach to colloquial Arabic** (perhaps to any language) but the
present volume, it is hoped, will, by presenting information in separate
‘packages’ on the printed pages, prepare the student’s approach to
mastering this most fascinating language.
*Lebanese Arabic in particular is much maligned by some orientalists.
In fact a study of its vocabulary reveals a very high percentage of
classical vocables.
**This manual has, perforce, to omit an essential element in everyday
Levantine communication, namely hand gestures. An illustrated
dictionary of the meanings of some hundreds of gestures could be
(indeed, once was) compiled. These differ from Mediterranean hand
gestures (with which they show some features) in that they not only
reinforce meaning but can also be used to hold meaningful
conversations across a distance.

INTRODUCTION

THE STRUCTURE OF ARABIC
The following are brief notes on how Arabic works, taking ten
broad features common to both written and spoken Arabic.
1
Arabic is a Semitic language (unlike Turkish and Persian), hence
the similarity to Arabic of Hebrew phrases from the Bible, e.g. Matt.
27:46: ‘Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lamma sabachthani?
that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou for-saken me?’
2
Semitic languages are distinguished by the triliteral root
system. The consonants k-t-b imply something to do with writing.
The addition of prefixes, infixes and suffixes generates words
connected with writing.
3
The root and pattern system in Arabic is highly developed
and, being on the whole consistent and predictable, can be used
by a foreign student to guess meanings of new words and increase
vocabulary. Thus, from k-t-b:
Pattern
Word
Remarks
1
ma/—a-
maktab
Office, study, bureau, desk
Pattern always means ‘place of…’
2
-aa-i-
kaatib
Clerk, writer, author
Pattern always means the active
participle or doer of the action
3
ma--oo-
maktoob
Letter
Pattern always means the passive
participle
4
-aa-a-
kaatab
To correspond with someone
Form III derived verb, usually means
to do the action to someone
5
mu-aa-i-     mukaatib     Correspondent
  
Active participle of (4) above
4 Predictability Arabic has almost complete predictability in its patterns
(cf. English: light/lit; fight/fought; sight/sighted). Past-tense verbs conjugate
with suffixes, for example, which are invariable for all verbs.
5 Consistency in spelling
(a)
Words can be spelled correctly once the sound is known
correctly. Not for Arabic the complexities of English: seen/
scene; bean/been etc.

INTRODUCTION
5
(b) The name of the consonant gives the consonant’s pronunciation.
Haa’ is the name of the sound registered by H (cf. English:
aitch=h).
6 Economy
(a)
Arabic has only two tenses, past and non-past.
(b) Arabic has basically only three short vowels (a, i and u), three
long (aa, ee and oo) and two diphthongs (ay and aw).
(c) In classical Arabic the short vowels do heavy morphological
duty for verb endings, case endings and pronoun distinction,
in ways which are clearly related, for example a final /i/ or /
ee/ means you, feminine singular, in both verbs and pronouns.
(d) In colloquial Arabic the same applies, but even more so:
colloquial has almost no case endings, and verb suffixes are far
fewer than in classical.
 
7 Simplicity Particularly in colloquial Arabic, sentence structure is very
simple: for example, equational sentences have no is/are. Furthermore,
Levantine Arabic like all Arabic dialects is much given to expressing a
great deal in highly truncated sentences and phrases and even single
words. (Cf. Egyptian multi-purpose use of the word for yes!)
8 Stress patterns The place of the stress—or prominence—in a
word is almost completely determined by fixed rules. In broad terms
the stress falls on the first syllable except when the word has a long
syllable. Then the stress falls on the nearest long syllable to the end
of the word.*
9 Formality Colloquial Arabic has many ritual or formal phrases in
greeting, salutation etc. (Beware of thinking, however, that the language
is cabalistic!)
10 Intonation Particular attention should be paid by students to
native speakers’ intonation: a wrong intonation is one of the clearest
markers of a foreign accent.
TRANSCRIPTION AND PRONUNCIATION
Systems of transliteration seem to vary only in degrees of repulsiveness.
No one system is satisfactory to all, and the general reader is often
*A long syllable is one with a long vowel or diphthong or a short vowel followed
by two consonants.

INTRODUCTION
6
deterred by an excessively scrupulous attempt to render phonetic
differences.
The system employed in this book uses only the symbols found
on an ordinary typewriter. In the writer’s experience most of the
apparent difficulties of using transliteration disappear when use is
made of a recording of the text (see How to use the book).
Introduction to Arabic pronunciation
1
Consonants and vowels The table below aims to guide the
beginner with a mixture of technical terms and layman’s language.
The recordings should also be used freely.
2
Stress Arabic stress rules are quite different from English, and
failure to observe this is one of the principal features of a foreign
accent.
(a)
short syllables have short vowels;
(b) long syllables have either long vowels or a diphthong; or a short
vowel followed by two consonants;
(c) in words with long and short syllables the stress falls on the
nearest long syllable to the end of the word;
(d) otherwise the stress is on the first syllable.
Examples: mu’Hamw  mad; bayróot; ána.
3
Intonation One of the principal features distinguishing Levantine
dialects one from another, and all from English, is the intonation, the
rise and fall of the voice. Students should note different intonation
patterns most carefully. A wrong intonation pattern is another common
feature of a foreign accent.
4
Junction and elision The student should note how words ‘run
together’, in order to avoid sounding too foreign.
A hyphen is intruded as a guide to pronunciation as follows:
between /s/ and /h/ when these symbols represent separate
consonants, for example,’as-hal (easy). Therefore when /sh/ is written
with no hyphen the sound is as in English ship. Similarly for k-h/kh,
t-h/th, d-h/dh and g-h/gh.
An asterisk (*) in the table below indicates that the pronunciation
of Levantine Arabic (in one or other dialect) may differ markedly
from that of classical Arabic.

INTRODUCTION
7
Please note
For most occurrences in classical Arabic of the unvoiced uvular plosive
(qaaf: /q/ in transliteration) the symbol /’/ is used (i.e. the symbol for
the glottal stop). Most Levantine dialects regularly make this
‘conversion’ from classical Arabic, but the student should note that:
 
1
Bedouin throughout the area use /g/ for /q/,
2
the Druzes systematically maintain /q/,
3
certain words always retain the classical /q/: al-qur’aan (Koran)
and al-qaahira (Cairo).

HOW TO USE THE BOOK
Without a teacher
There are scores of possible ways of using a combination of the
Arabic text, the translation or key and the sound recording of the
Arabic, but among the possibilities are the following four step-by-
step procedures for exercises and dialogues:
1
Read the English; say the Arabic; hear the Arabic recording; repeat
the Arabic.
2
As 1 and then: play your own voice recording; play the Arabic;
correct where necessary.
3
Hear the Arabic recording (at any point, i.e. in random fashion);
write the translation; check and correct where necessary.
4
Use the recordings for memorizing vocabulary; test yourself by
covering up the Arabic version and saying the Arabic; check from
the recording.
All sections of text which are on the cassette are marked 



 in the margin.
With a teacher
The teacher will want to use his own methods based on experience,
but the following suggestions may be useful.
1
Ten drills based on the sentences and dialogues: repetition;
inflexion; replacement; restatement; completion; transposition;
expansion; contraction; transformation; integration. (See the author’s
Course in Colloquial Arabic, Beirut, 1974, pp. 12–14)
Of these, transformation is particularly valuable for Arabic; a
given sentence can be changed for tense, negativeness, positiveness,
interrogative etc.
2
Random comprehension practice The teacher may use the
Arabic of the dialogues or the exercises for rapid-fire testing of

INTRODUCTION
12
comprehension (in random order, preferably) or for eliciting the
correct response.
3
Action and movement The teacher may have the student(s) act
out the dialogues with appropriate exits and entrances when necessary.
4
Recapitulation The student(s) may be asked to re-tell the story
of the dialogues and the anecdote in Lesson sixteen.
5
Vocabulary testing This can be done Arabic-English or English-
Arabic using the lists in each chapter or, at a later stage, the vocabularies
at the end of the book.

13
PART ONE
THE LESSONS
LESSON  ONE
NOUNS AND ADJECTIVES;
BASIC SENTENCES
FIRST, THE GOOD NEWS
Equational sentences (e.g. The teacher/he…is…)
You can communicate a great deal in perfectly correct Arabic (spoken
and written) without using a single verb.
1
The present tenses of to be and to have are not in the form of
conjugated verbs in Arabic (see Lesson two for to have). In fact
there is no need normally to say is/are.
2
The negative is formed by using one word (mush)
systematically for nouns, adjectives and adverbs.
3
The interrogative is formed by simply changing the
intonation of the voice. Compare English: They are not here,
Aren’t they here?
Examples
Salim is here—saleem hawn
Salim is not here—saleem mush hawn
Is Salim here?—saleem hawn?
Is Salim not here?—saleem mush hawn?
Karim is Lebanese—kareem lubnaanee
Karim is not Lebanese—kareem mush lubnaanee
Is Karim Lebanese?—kareem lubnaanee?
Is Karim not Lebanese?—kareem mush lubnaanee?

LESSON ONE
14
Note The ‘Karim’ sentences illustrate that all adjectives may be used
as nouns. Indeed the classical grammarians say that the whole of
Arabic grammar may be summed up in three parts: nouns, verbs and
particles.
SUBJECT PRONOUNS
Singular
Plural
1 c.
’ana
’iHna
2 m
’inta
’intoo
2 f.
’intee
’intoo
3 m.
huwa
hum
3 f.
hiya
hum
Note (1) You and I—’ana oo ’inta. (2) Many dialects use a different
compound form of the subject pronouns (see below, in Lesson two,
‘Possession’): You and I—’ana oo iyyaak.
Examples
They are Jordanians—hum ’urdunee-een
We are Syrians—’iHna sooree-een
They are the Lebanese girls—hum ’il-banaat il-lubnaanee-een
AGREEMENT
Adjectives and verbs agree in gender and number with their noun or
pronoun subjects in Arabic. On the other hand…
1
There is no indefinite article, let alone a declined one as in
many European languages.
2
The definite article does not change for gender or number.
3
Plural non-humans are regarded as feminine singular for the
purposes of grammatical agreement.
GENDER
The feminine adjective is formed in most cases by simply adding /a/
: shaikh, shaikha; sulTaan, sulTaana; lubnaanee, lubnaaneea; urdunee,
urduneea.

LESSON ONE
15
Adjectives formed from names, such as lubnaan/lubnaanee, bayroot/
bayrootee, are called nisba adjectives (meaning relationship). When made
feminine (by adding /a/) they double the /ee/ sound. The feminine
nisba ending will henceforth be transcribed-iyya.
Noun
Adjective
Feminine adjective
lubnaan
lubnaanee
lubnaaniyya
bayroot
bayrootee
bayrootiyya
dimashq
dimashqee
dimashqiyya
Examples
The boy is Syrian—’il-walad sooree
The girl is Syrian—’il-bint sooriyya
The boy is a Muslim—’il-walad muslim
The girl is a Muslim—’il-bint muslima
Conversely, most nouns ending in /a/ are feminine.
NUMBER
1
Arabic has a form for dual (two of anything) formed by
adding -ayn (as in Bahrain, Alamain etc,):
The two boys are here—’il-waiadayn hawn
The two girls are here—’il-bintayn hawn
2
The most common plural formula (the ‘sound’ one) is that
composed of the adjective/noun plus -een:
a Syrian—sooree (NB no indefinite article in Arabic)
the Syrians—’is-sooree-een
(Plurals formed otherwise—see Vocabulary—are called broken
plurals.)
3
In colloquial Arabic the feminine plural ending (-aat) is not
extensively used:
The girls are Syrian—’il-banaat sooree-een
4
The attributive adjective (e.g. ‘the Syrian girls’) must also be
definite:
the Jordanian girls—’il-banaat ’il-’urdunee-een

LESSON ONE
16
5
Usually a dual noun (especially with humans) will, in
colloquial Arabic, have a plural adjective:
the two Lebanese girls—’il-bintayn ’il-lubnaanee-een
THE IDAFA OR CONSTRUCT
This feature of Arabic has no equivalent in English, but the rules can
be learned from simple, well-known examples.
The Arabic name Dar es Salaam means ‘the abode of peace’. Notice
that the first definite article is not used.
Rule 1
in the structure the…of the…the first definite article is not
found:
the book of the boy—kitaab ’il-walad
Rule 2
the construct, if longer, removes all but the final definite
article:
the book of the son of the teacher—kitaab ’ibn il-mu9allim
Rule 3
there is no ‘apostrophe s’ in Arabic. ‘The boy’s book’ must
be rendered ‘the book of the boy’.

LESSON TWO
POSSESSION AND PRONOUNS
POSSESSION
1
The verb to have (present tense) is expressed in Arabic by saying
that something is with /to/ in the possession of someone.
I have a book—9indee kitaab
They have a book—9indhum kitaab
9ind implies with/in the possession of/chez etc. The pronouns attached
to it have multiple uses: as possessive pronouns, object pronouns and
as additions to prepositions.
The full table is:
Singular
Plural
1 c.
-ee (-nee when object of
 -naa
verb and following
   prep, fee)
2 m.
-ak
-kum (or koo)
2 f.
-ik
-kum (or koo)
3 m.
-o
-hum
3 f.
-ha
-hum
2
The negative is as follows:
I do not have a book—maa 9indee kitaab
Hasn’t she a book?—maa 9indhaa kitaab?
3
my book—kitaabee
their books—kutubhum (etc.)
Note My book=the book of me. The definite article disappears, as
this is a kind of idafa or construct. Attributive adjectives added to my
book etc. must be definite.
my new book—kitaabee il-jadeed
her Arabic book—kitaabhaa il-9arabee
Note also A refinement is introduced for nouns ending in /a/ (see
Vocabulary note below).

LESSON TWO
19
OTHER PRONOUN USES
1
you and I—’ana oo ’inta
In many Levantine dialects, however, this becomes ’ana oo ’iyyaak; i.e.
the possessive pronoun is added to ’iyyaa.
we and they—’iHna oo ’iyyaahum
(In such phrases, pronoun order is always 1, 2 3; for example: you and
they—inta oo iyyaahum.)
2
Added to prepositions:
from—min
with—ma9a

VERBS, WORD ORDER
AND DEMONSTRATIVES
VERBS: INTRODUCTION
Strong men have been known to blench at the thought of conjugating
verbs; any verbs, let alone Arabic ones. Moreover the published memoirs
of old-Arab-world hands are replete with heart-rending accounts of
grappling in Aden or Lebanon (without benefit of air-conditioning
and heating respectively) with the forty-four (or was it ninety-two?)
forms of the verbal noun.
There are difficulties, but the reader may be assured that the
Arabic verb system is much easier to grasp than that of Russian,

German or French, and is simplicity itself compared to the English.
Not for Arabic speakers the deviousness of the (British) English ‘I
should’ve thought…’, meaning ‘I think, and contradiction is
inconceivable’. Arabic is by comparison the soul of economy and
elegance, in form and function.
First the bad news
– Arabic verbs conjugate for number and gender (classical Arabic
verbs have thirteen ‘persons’: singular, dual and plural).
– In addition to indulging in fancies such as hollow verbs, assimilated
verbs, doubly defective verbs and quadriliteral verbs, Arabic is prolific
in derived forms of the same, viz. Forms II to XV.
– For the ‘simple’ verb there are forty-four patterns possible for the
verbal noun.
Now the good news
– Colloquial Arabic has no dual form in verb conjugation.
– The distinction between plural masculine and feminine is
neutralized: i.e. there is only one form for each of we, you and they
(dual masculine and feminine; plural masculine and feminine).
– Arabic has only two tenses: past and non-past.
– The past tense is formed by adding suffixes.
– The non-past is formed by adding prefixes (plus some of the ‘past’
suffixes to indicate number).
– Prefixes and suffixes are standard for all types of verb.
There is almost no such thing as an irregular verb in Arabic.
– The subject of the verb if a pronoun (I/we etc.) is included in the
subject; pronouns are used only to give extra emphasis.
– The economy of prefixes/suffixes used is extreme: the foreigner
often feels there is risk of ambiguity. For example:
I/you (m. sing.) wrote—katab/t/
you (m. sing.)/she writes—ta/ktub
– The prefixes and suffixes are nearly all clearly related to the subject/
possessive pronouns (see Lessons one and two). For example:
you (f. sing.) wrote—katab/tee (cf. in/tee: you f. sing.)
you (pl.) wrote—katab/too (cf. ’in/too: you pl.)

LESSON THREE
26
– Negation of verbs is done in only one way in colloquial Arabic:
the word maa is placed immediately before all forms of the verb
(classical Arabic has one form for past (maa) and another for non-
past (laa), a distinction more or less suppressed in colloquial
Arabic).
– The interrogative form is nearly always achieved by simply changing
the intonation of the affirmative form.
– Derived forms in colloquial Arabic are nine only, not II–XV as in
classical Arabic.
To sum up
As with reports of Mark Twain’s death, reports of the difficulty of
Arabic verbs have been greatly exaggerated.
CONJUGATION OF PAST TENSE OF SIMPLE VERBS
he wrote—katab
Note In Arabic grammar the starting point is always he, not the infinitive
as in European languages (to write etc.).
Singular
Plural

I—katabt
we—katabnaa

you—katabt
you—katabtoo
2f.
you—katabti
you—katabtoo
3m.
he—katab
they—kataboo
3f.
she—katabat
they—kataboo
Note The above is the active voice. The passive (It was written) is little
used in colloquial: either They wrote it or Form VII (see below, Derived
forms of verbs) is used.
Exercise
Conjugate the following verbs:
open, fataH; eat, ’akal; return, come back, raja9; drink, sharib; know,
9araf; do, make, 9amil; take, ’akhad; go up, Tala9; go down, nazal;
ask, sa’al

LESSON THREE
27
OBJECT PRONOUNS
The object pronouns (see Lesson two) are suffixed to verbs:
He wrote it—katabo
She knew them—9arafat-hum
Note When it/him (o) is added to verbs ending in a long vowel, the
pronoun is indicated simply by lengthening the final vowel (indicated
below by (h)):
You (f. sing.) wrote it—katabtee(h)
They ate it—’akaloo(h)
WORD ORDER
Classical Arabic prefers the order: verb+subject+predicate. For example:
wrote+The boys+letters. Furthermore, in such cases the verb is always
singular.
Colloquial Arabic prefers the order: subject+verb+predicate.
The boys wrote letters—’il-’awlaad kataboo makaateeb
i.e. the verb agrees in gender and number with its subject.
NEGATION AND INTERROGATION
Negation
The rule is very simple: the verb takes maa, immediately preceding.
The boys did not write letters—’il-’awlaad maa kataboo makaateeb
Interrogative form
This is indicated by changing the intonation. Occasionally a classical
Arabic form (hal) is used, particularly when a speaker wishes to upstage
his interlocutor. (Arabic has many devices to be used as conversation-
stoppers or to focus the attention of the speaker. See Lesson fourteen
on Proverbs.)
Did they write letters?—hal kataboo makaateeb?

LESSON THREE

DERIVED FORMS OF VERBS
Introduction (Past tense)
This section concentrates on the aspects of conjugation, meaning-
survey and usage. Like the man who discovered he had been
speaking prose all his life, the student may be pleasantly surprised to
find he has been using Arabic derived-form verbs without being a
master of the contents of Wright’s Arabic Grammar (2 vols, 3rd edn,
Cambridge, 1964).
Conjugation
All forms except IX (see Lesson seven below) are conjugated exactly
like the verbs in the previous section of this chapter. For example:
from he knew—9araf
comes they became acquainted (with)—ta9arrafoo (9ala)
This is a Form V verb.
Below are some specimen verbs:
 
Form II
send someone/thing back
rajja9
(from come back
raja9)
III
correspond with someone
kaatab
(from write
katab)
IV
send someone/thing down
’anzal
(from go down
nazal)
V
become acquainted (with)
ta9arraf(9ala)
(from know
9araf)
VI
become acquainted with each other ta9aaraf
(from know
9araf)
VII
be written
’inkatab
(from write
katab)
VIII
be assembled
’ijtama9
(from gather, add
jama9)
X
use, employ
’ista9mal
(from do, make
9amil)

LESSON THREE
29
Survey of meaning and usage
The forms of verbs are completely consistent: Form VII verbs
always put /’in/ before the Form I verb; Form V verbs always
double the middle radical of Form I verbs and put /ta/ before the
result (which, itself, is the form for Form II verbs); and so on.
Exercise: form the derived forms of fa9al.
Meaning is not quite so consistent: hence the many academic
jokes about the meaning of Arabic derived-form verbs. However,
in general the following guide is true, though not the whole truth.
Form II
often means to make someone do the action of Form I:
hence rajja9 means ‘to make someone/thing go back’, i.e. ‘to
send back’.
Form III
frequently means to do the action of Form I to
someone: hence kaatab means ‘to write to someone’. (Lots of
academic jokes here on the sexual proclivities of Form III verbs.
And in fact the verb ‘to have sexual intercourse with (a woman)’
is a Form III verb.)
Form IV
often has the same meaning as Form II. Both nazzal (II)
and ’anzal (IV) mean ‘to make go down’ (e.g. to drop off passengers
from a cab). (’anzal means also ‘to send down the revelation’, i.e.
reveal the Koran.) Note IV frequently has a ‘denominative’
meaning. For example ’aslam means ‘to become a Muslim’.
Form V
usually the passive of II. 9arraf(II) means ‘to make
someone know someone’ (i.e. introduce someone to someone
else), so ta9arraf (V) (9ala) means ‘to be introduced (to)
someone’.
Form VI
usually the reflexive of III: hence ta9aarafoo means ‘they
got to know one another’.
Form VII
in Levantine Arabic a heavily used form, by
comparison with other dialects. It is most commonly used in
place of the passive. Where other dialects use the passive or the
form ‘They did so-and-so’, Levantine Arabic generates Form VII
verbs. From the verbs in the previous section come: be opened,
infataH; be edible, ’in ’akal; be drinkable,’insharib; be known,
’in9araf; be done, ’in9amal.

LESSON THREE
30
Form VIII
frequently the passive of Form I. jama9=gather, add;
’ijtama9=be gathered, assembled.
Form X
has possibly the most diverse collection of areas of
meaning attaching to it, some only vaguely related: hence yet
more academic jokes. Frequently has a sense of ‘to make
something perform the action of Form I’. Hence ista9mal
means ‘to make something work’, i.e. ‘employ’. (Form IX, by
the way, is used only for colours and defects in classical Arabic,
and in colloquial Arabic almost solely for colours: e.g. ’iHmarr
means ‘to become red’, from ’ahmar, red. See Lesson seven
below.)

(The intonation indicates that this is a sentence with a predicate in
the definite form. The first syllable in the sentence is more stressed
than usual.)
When used as adjectives all forms of this can be replaced by hal. For
example:
These boys are Lebanese—hal-’awlaad lubnaanee-een
In Lebanon, especially, a double-demonstrative is frequently used.

Anyone knowing classical Arabic will recognize the similarity to
colloquial Arabic forms. The above forms are used in colloquial Arabic,
for example following auxiliary verbs (such as must, laazim; may, mumkin)
but in the Levant two changes are made to the above.
1
Where u is the vowel before the third radical, u is most
frequently used also before the first radical: i.e. there is regressive
vowel harmony: yaktub becomes yuktub. (Bear this in mind for the
imperative form below.)
2
Before the prefixes mentioned above, a bilabial (unreleased) is
added, which is /b/ in all forms except 1 plural, where it is /m/

Meaning and extensions
1
The non-past form, above, means
He is writing, he writes—byuktub
Also, ‘he does write’ (but see present continuous, at 7 below)
2
He will write—raaH yuktub
(Note raaH does not change for number or gender. After most
auxiliary verbs the non-past has no /b/ or /m/ prefix.)
3
We must write—laazim nuktub
Note We must not write—mush laazim nuktub
(Again: laazim is invariable and the non-past verb has no /b/ or /
m/ prefix.)
4
He wants to write—biddo yuktub (bidd+pronouns+verb
without b/m)
5
They may write—mumkin yuktuboo (i.e. ‘possibly’)
6
We can write—feenaa nuktub
(The preposition fee (‘in’) takes the normal pronoun suffixes and
comes to mean ‘it is in my power/ability’:
Note I can—feenee)

Syria)

ELATIVES (comparatives and superlatives)
Possibly the two most powerful words in all Arabic, and indeed in all
Islamic history:
God is Most Great!—allaahu ’akbar!
The pattern ’a/k/ba/r is typical of all comparatives and superlatives
(elative).

The elative without ’al- is comparative.
The elative with ’al- is superlative. (Al-Azhar, in Cairo, means ‘the
most resplendent’.)
Where radicals 2 and 3 are the same, note the formation:

LESSON FIVE

Meaning and usage
Active participle
1
Normally this is the doer of the action. For example:
kaatib (writer); 9aalim (scholar); mu9allim (teacher); mukaatib
(correspondent).
2
Sometimes, the active participle can mean that an action has
been completed. For example:
Will you have something to drink?—btishrab shee?
No, thanks! I’ve had a drink—laa, shukran! ’ana shaarib
3
A common Levantine usage is:
He has just arrived—ba9do waaSil
We have just arrived—ba9dna waaSileen
(i.e. the preposition ba9d+pronouns+active participle, which is
inflected for gender and number. Compare Irish-English ‘He’s
(just) after coming’).
4
faatiH can mean ‘opened’ (e.g. for shops).
Passive participle
1
In the strict sense of the passive participle—the action having
been done:
It has been written—maktoob
(This expression is used to accept fate, in the sense that such-and-
such an occurrence has been known to God forever.)
2
As a noun: maktoob (‘a letter’). Note many such nouns have
broken plurals.
letter
maktoob becomes makaateeb, but
drink
mashroob becomes mashroobaat
3
Some plural passive participles have no singular:
information—ma9loomaat
food—ma’koolaat
4
The passive participles of derived-form verbs can be used to

LESSON FIVE

together) is mujtama9.
hospital (place of seeking a cure)—mustashfa

HOLLOW VERBS AND
‘TO BE ABLE’
HOLLOW VERBS
These verbs are so called because the middle radical is unstable: a
verb with /aa/ medial in the past may become /aa/, /ee/ or /oo/ in
the non-past, according to certain rules: kaan (he was) may be taken as
an example.
Past

KAAN AND VERBS (pluperfect and past continuous)
He had studied—kaan daras
We had studied—kunna darasna
Rule
The pluperfect of any verb is formed by kaan+verb (past tense, both
verbs conjugating):
He was studying or He used to study—kaan yudrus
To emphasize past continuity many Levantine dialects use the particle
of the present continuous, 9am (see Lesson four).
He was studying—kaan 9am byudrus

Note All active participles have /i/ or /ee/ finally. All passive
participles have /a/ or /aa/ finally. Notice that in VII and VIII /aa/
distinguishes both forms, active and passive.
TO BE ABLE
Arabic has a distinction somewhat similar to that of French between
savoir and pouvoir, though in Arabic there is more free variation. Two
verbs are acceptable: ’adar, byi’dir; and 9araf, byi9raf. These are followed
by another verb always in the non-past (with some exceptions in some
dialects), with no b/m- prefix.
Can you write?—bta9rif tuktub? or bti’dir tuktub?
He could not write the letter—maa ’adar yuktub il-maktoob

as different conjugations.

LESSON NINE
RELATIVE PRONOUNS,
VERBAL NOUNS AND
POSSESSION
THE RELATIVE PRONOUN (who, which, etc.)
This construction in Arabic is simplicity itself, in comparison with
English.
The man whom I saw, the man I saw, the man that I saw are three
perfectly acceptable spoken and written usages in English.
Furthermore, dialects may say The man who (’oo) I saw; the man what
(wot) I saw, not to mention the man as I saw and the man worr I saw, etc.
All of these are rendered in practically every dialect through the
Arabic-speaking world as follows:
ir-rajul ’iilee shufto
The complexities of English are not to be found in Arabic. (‘This
is a thing up with which I will not put’ ‘A preposition is something
which you should not end a sentence with’)
Rules
1
illee is invariable for all genders and numbers: case does not
arise because
2
’illee is best regarded as a word linking two co-ordinate
sentences (as its name in Arabic grammar implies)
3
When the antecedent is indefinite, ’illee is omitted.
Examples
He is the man who went to Beirut—huwa ir-rajul ’illee raaH ’ila
bayroot
He is the man whom I saw in Beirut—huwa ’ir-rajul ’illee 
shufto
fee 
bayroot.
They are the men in whose car I went to Beirut—hum ’ir- rijaal
’illee ruHt ’ila bayroot fee sayyaarat-hum
She is the woman in whose sister’s car I went to Beirut—hiyya ’il-
mara illee ruHt ’ila bayroot fee sayyaarat ’ukht-ha

LESSON NINE
64
There’s a girl here who wants to speak to you—fee bint hawn 
bidd-
ha tiHkee ma9ak
From these examples it can be seen that when translating from English
one first makes two sentences which contain the same meaning.
These sentences are translated and then linked with ’illee (omitted
when the antecedent is indefinite).
This is the explanation for the slightly odd-looking ‘the man
(whom) I saw him’.
THE VERBAL NOUN
This is roughly the equivalent of the ‘infinitive’ (to write, to see etc.),
but also equates with the so-called gerund (e.g. ‘seeing is believing’).
Arabic would use the verbal noun in the above cases,
Examples
Writing Arabic is easy—kitaabat ’il-lugha ’il-9arabiyya sahla
He likes reading and writing—byiHibb ’il-’iraya oo il-kitaaba
(Note The verbal noun is usually definite.)
Uses of the verbal noun
Arabic uses the verbal noun where English frequently uses some
other construction. An example is airport flight announcements. Where
English says ‘Would passengers please proceed…’ etc. Arabic says
‘The proceeding of the passengers is requested….’
Examples
1
Adverbially
He hit him hard—Darabo Darab (lit. he hit him a hitting’)
In this usage the verbal noun may take an adjective, for example:
He hit him repeatedly (a continuous hitting)—Darabo Darab
mutawaa Sil

LESSON NINE
65
2
In place of clauses
After Muhammad arrived—ba9ad wuSool muHammad
3
As the infinitive
He likes to visit the Arabic countries—byiHibb zeeaarat il-bilaad ’
il-9arabiyya
4
As the gerund
He likes travelling—byiHibb is-safar
5
To render ‘as…as’ etc. Arabic does not have the equivalent small
words of German, French and English (so…wie; aussi… que; as…as),
but among ways of rendering such constructions is the use of the
verbal noun.
He is as interested in English as he is in Arabic—byihtamm
billugha il-inkleeziyya ihtimaamo bil-lugha il-9arabiyya
6
To render a variety of clauses
(a)
because the students are not here—bisabab 9adam (lack)
wujood iT-Tulaab (lit. ‘the lack of the presence of…’)
(b) because the students may attend—bisabab ’imkaaniyyat
HuDoor iT-Tullaab (‘because of the possibility of the students’
attendance’)
7
In formal Arabic: for example notices or announcements which may
be broadcast and will therefore be part of the student’s contact
with spoken Arabic.
no smoking—mamnoo9 (forbidden) it-tadkheen
no parking—mamnoo9 (forbidden) il-wu’oof
please (come forward)—’ar-rajaa (both parts are v.ns) ’al-HuDoor
8
In idioms
absolutely beautiful—fee muntaha al-jamaal
(Note 3 and 4 above are very common in colloquial Arabic; 1, 2, 5,
6, 7 and 8 are used in a slightly elevated form of colloquial Arabic,
or, indeed, in standard written Arabic.)

LESSON NINE
66
Forms of the verbal noun
Wright’s Arabic Grammar lists forty-four forms possible for the verbal
noun (apart from the derived forms which have standard patterns
for each form). It is not necessary to memorize these forms, but the
student will need to memorize the form(s) occurring for each
particular verb. (These are given in the vocabulary lists at the end of
the book.) Some common forms are:
Past
Verbal noun
1
understand
fahim
fahm
2

fariH
faraH
3
sit
jalas
juloos
The forms for derived-form verbal nouns are as follows.
   II

   X

POSSESSION
Levantine Arabic has another formula for indicating possession, in
addition to the construct (Lesson one) and 9ind (Lesson two). This is
the word taba9 (cf. classical Arabic taabi9, meaning ‘subordinate to,
belonging to’). taba9 has a variety of uses
1
his book—’il-kitaab taba9o
2
the book of the boy—’il-kitaab taba9 il-walad
3
The book belongs to the boy—’il-kitaab taba9 il-walad
(There is a difference in intonation between the above: 3 is an example
of an equational sentence; hence the lack of a verb.)
Whose is this book?—hal-kitaab taba9 meen? (Also la-meen hal-
kitaab?)

LESSON NINE
67
In some Levantine dialects taba9 has a feminine, taba9a, and a plural,
taba9een. For example:
his boys—’il-’awlaad taba9eeno

CONDITIONAL SENTENCES
CONDITIONAL SENTENCES (‘If…’)
1
The rules for classical Arabic ‘if’ sentences are very elaborate,
but the colloquial rules are much simpler.
2
Real or ‘probable’ conditional sentences
Arabic uses ‘iza for ‘if’ in sentences such as:
If you see him tell him I’m here—iza btshoofo ’ool lo ’ana hawn
3
Unreal or ‘impossible’ conditional sentences
law is used:
if I had a million dollars—law kaan 9indee milyoon doolaar
4
The rules for sequence of tenses are much less elaborate than
in classical Arabic.
If they had gone that way down to Beirut they would be there
by now—law kaanoo nazaloo ila bayroot min hunaak kaanoo
waSaloo (halla’).

A classical word for ‘if’ (’in) is used in some formal

(a) The classical in is used:

LESSON TWELVE
IDIOMS
 
The vernacular of the Levant is rich in idioms, as is the vernacular of
any society where speech is prized as an art-form. (‘Wisdom alighted
on three things, the brain of the Franks, the hand of the Chinese and
the tongue of the Arabs.’) Poetry recitals, songs, Koran recitations,
story-telling, poetry composition, word-games, speech-making, zajl
competitions,* are all examples of Arabic language activity which are
still highly prized.
The Levant is no exception among Arabic societies. Before the
Lebanese civil war a bon mot at a public zajl competition would often
be greeted by enthusiastic small-arms fire. But, apart from formal
activities such as the above, Arabic everyday speech is vivid and
idiomatic. Levantine Arabic is especially rich and varied, as its
geographical area includes coastal plain and mountain, desert and
plateau, villages, rural settlements and metropolitan areas, while the
communities range from trilingual western-orientated city dwellers
to monolingual Bedu; from Druze ‘initiates’ to Muslim peasants; and
from Imams to Maronite patriarchs and cultivators, not to mention
*Extempore competitions in rhyming colloquial poetry on themes set as debating
topics between rival teams.

LESSON TWELVE
77
Armenians, Greek Orthodox, Chaldean Catholics, Nestorians, Roman
Catholics and even Aramaic-speaking communities. Given such variety
it is not surprising that there is a wide range of idiom (mariners and
mountaineers, peasants and traders, Christian and Muslim, etc.). The
approximately 200 idioms which follow are a modest offering from a
wealth of possible items.
The arrangement is alphabetical Arabic-English and English-Arabic,
taking the initial letter of the main word in the idiom.

’a 9oozu billaah min ash-

LESSON THIRTEEN
TERMS OF ADDRESS AND
REFERENCE
English is poverty-stricken by comparison with Arabic in terms of
address and reference. In the Levant one can ring the changes in
everyday communication on a great range of titles for people (coupled
with a vocative ‘O…!’) depending on whether they are young, old,
male or female, venerable, known or unknown, superior or inferior
in station, single or in a group, and even according to religious
denomination: a priest has a different title from a mufti, a Druze elder
from a young Druze in modern dress. The terms which follow are a
mere selection of those it is possible to hear in the Levant on a
typical day between town and village, between home and souq, school
and office.
Words on a page cannot describe fully the background to the
terms given. Only experience can tell the foreigner how to use the
terms freely. A start may be made on those expressions which are
almost entirely unambiguous, being addressed to people whose status
is known, and being, in most cases, meant literally, (yaa, the vocative,
is invariable and has none of the quaint old fashioned sound of
‘O…’in English. Exclamation marks and ‘O…’are omitted in the
translation into English.)

LESSON THIRTEEN
91
Arabic
Meaning
Used to*
 50 yaa allaah!
Allah
Many uses; often,
e.g. ‘how could
anyone be so
brazen as to do/
say a thing like that!’
The above categories are by no means exhaustive, and each category
has many additional terms. Furthermore each term could be described
at greater length: for example yaa 9azeezee, yaa Habeebee (‘my dear, my
darling’) could be used in exasperation or remonstrance, And so
on…. However, the above are an indispensable minimum which the
student should recognize and begin to use.
REFERENCE
Very often such terms are the obverse of terms of reference For
example, when referring to some distinguished person one would
say HaDino, whereas one would address him as HaDirtak (His/ Your
Honour). A Muslim religious dignitary would be referred to as
samaaHto.
Three terms should be noted which overlap address and reference.
In asking, ‘What is your name?’, one may say:
1
shoo’ism il-’akh?
What is the name of the brother?
2
shoo’ism il-kareem?
What is the name of the noble one?
3
shoo’ism il-9azeez?
What is the name of the dear one?
Such formulae could be used for many questions: for example Where
are you from?’, ‘Is this yours?’ and so on.
ADDRESS AND REFERENCE IN RELIGIOUS TERMS
Scores of terms may be used to address a stranger in Islamic terms:
yaa 9abdo! (‘O, His slave!’) is an example. Indeed, in some dialects any
male stranger may be acceptably addressed as yaa muHammad!
 
*But not exclusively, in any particular example below

LESSON FOURTEEN
92
PATRONYMICS etc.
A married couple with children may be addressed as the parents of
the first-born male child. Such address implies closeness and respect
on the part of the speaker. The parents of Ashraf would be described
and addressed as ’aboo ’ashraf and ’umm ’ashraf. Couples without
children and even unmarried men may be given honorific parenthood
titles such as ’aboo Zayd (hence the widespread use of such terms for
describing PLO figures).
Holders of certain names are traditionally called ’aboo so-and-so. A
man called Muhammad may be styled Abul-Qasim (recalling the Prophet
Muhammad’s son who died in infancy). For Chnstians a slightly
bantering example would be that a Maroun would be styled ’aboo-T-
Taa’ifa (‘Father of the Sect’, i.e. of the Maronites)
 
LESSON FOURTEEN
PROVERBS
Proverbs are used with great effect in Levantine Arabic—as in all
Arabic dialects—and are highly prized as the distillation of collective
wisdom and experience. A native English speaker would be wary of
using English proverbs, fearing to sound quaint or tendentious or
both, but Arabic proverbs are used in all contexts.
The student should note carefully how proverbs are used, and
with practice should be able to use them appropriately. But be careful!
A foreigner using the proverb ‘Tie the donkey where its master tells
you to’ (i.e. ‘Follow the boss’s instructions!’) once caused a major
industrial stoppage, since he seemed to be calling an Arab subordinate
a donkey!
The following fifty proverbs have been chosen for their popularity.
Where necessary explanation is added. Very distinctive attitudes and
particular beliefs or superstitions are shown in Nos 10, 14, 20, 22, 23,
24, 25, 26, 29, 30, 31, 32, 35 to 50.

LESSON FIFTEEN
COURTESY EXPRESSIONS FOR
VARIOUS OCCASIONS
British English must be unique among developed languages in having
no agreed response to the phrase, ‘Thank you’. By comparison,
Levantine Arabic is rich in polite formulae for every occasion. There
is a danger, however, that the foreign student may fear that ‘courtesy’
Arabic is a cabalistic language which only the initiates may master
after undergoing years of travail and nameless rites.
This chapter explains usage appropriate to salutations,
congratulations, condolences etc. From the ten sections covered it
will be seen that certain phrases are comm on to many occasions, in
particular, invocation to the Deity. The name of allaah is used on most
occasions and, indeed, ‘God bless you’ (allaah yisallimak) is possibly
the most frequently used courtesy formula,
Greetings and welcomes
The Arab gives and expects a warm welcome.

Conclusion
The above phrases are but a fraction of the possibilities, but will take
the student a long way. With increasing familiarity he will pick up
variants and additions. It should be noted that, of course, many of
the above will need the addition of names or titles or patronymic
(see Lesson thirteen on terms of address). Again, much variety is to
be expected as between the many communities making up Levant
society.
Much more detail on courtesy expressions of the Levant will be
found in H.T.Farha’s manual (see Bibliography).
The student should be ready to be generous with expressions of
courtesy, remembering the common Arabic phrase, ‘Anyone who
greets you, return his greeting twice over.’

TRANSLATION
Once, there was an Englishman who came to the (this) country to
learn Arabic. He registered (his name) at the School of Languages
in the centre of the capital and began to study classical Arabic as well
as colloquial. A week later they saw that he was not making any
progress at all. He could not pronounce even the simplest words. For
this reason the director of the school saw that it was necessary to
amend the programme (syllabus) a little in order to help the
unfortunate young man. (It was) a shame that he should come from
London and pay the expense of an air ticket as well as the school
fees in addition to daily expenses, that is, the cost of food, drink and
accommodation (sleep), and (then) after all this not learn a thing! So
the director agreed with his teacher on changing the syllabus, on the
basis of abandoning classical (Arabic) and concentrating on
colloquial.
They tried the new syllabus for a whole month but with no
success (without benefit). The young man learned…(well…let’s) say
he learned nothing. He could speak no more than 2 or 3 words.
(And) really (it was) completely broken Arabic. The teacher went
back to the director and said to him,
‘Director, allow me to tell you: this young Englishman who is
with me in the class is completely useless. It’s better for him to go
back to his country. It’s (absolutely) no use at all. If he were to stay
twenty years more in the school it would be impossible for him to
learn to speak Arabic, believe me!’
‘Well, I appreciate the position you’re in. But what can we do?’
‘I’ll tell you what. I have a suggestion. I hope it is to your liking.’

LESSON SIXTEEN
104
‘Please go ahead. I want to help him, poor chap. ’
‘Why don’t we make an arrangement with (some) people for him
to stay (sit) with them for six months or a year and speak nothing but
Arabic with them? In that way (thus) he must learn, in spite of
himself!’
‘An excellent idea. But where? Do you know anyone?’
‘Yes. I have relatives living in the country, maybe 400 miles from
here. (They are) a large group, very nice (people), and there’s not a
single one of them knows English.’
‘Wonderful. Can you arrange a way for him to stay with them?
We will pay them what is necessary. Then…(Well), we’ll see.’
‘We will rely on God!’
Then they made an agreement with the teacher’s family, who
received the young man in the village and arranged two rooms for
him in the house of the teacher’s cousin.
This happened at the end of the year, and six months later, that is,
in the summer, the director of the school sent the teacher to the
village to enquire about the young man and see if he needed anything.
After an hour in the aircraft and two hours in the small bus which
runs between the village and the centre for the province the teacher
arrived, praising God and thanking Him, at the beginning of the
village.
When he got off the bus he saw a peasant working at the side of
the road. He greeted him and began to speak with him.
‘Hello! May God give you the fitness!’
‘May God increase you in strength sir! Welcome! How are you
(Your Honour)?’
‘We thank God every hour! Won’t you sit down for a while, sir?’
‘Thank you but I wanted to finish my journey (complete the
way) to the village and see my family and my friend. Maybe you
know him, the Englishman who came here about six months ago?’
‘Of course I know him!’
‘Where is he now?’
‘He’s just round the corner in the fish-and-chip shop!’

LESSON SEVENTEEN
A MISCELLANY
 
Of learning languages there is no end. There are always deeper levels
to fathom even in one’s own language, let alone in a foreign language,
to say nothing of a language from a different family, in this case the
Semitic family.
The student will always be learning Arabic. There is always more
to learn, but this is no cause for despair: the same is true of every
language. It is in this sense that all languages are equally difficult. In
this chapter fifteen miscellaneous topics are taken which constantly
crop up in everyday communication in Arabic, and with which the
student should have some familiarity. Some relate to syntax and idiom,
others are sociological, anthropological, religious, historical,
etymological or morphological.
1
Simple as A, B, C
Arabic uses abjad, hawaz etc. for A, B, C…. The letters of the alphabet
are taken and made into words which sound like genuine Arabic
words. These are abjad, hawaz, HuTTee, kalman, sa9fas, qurshit, thakhadha,
DaZagha.
Furthermore each letter in classical Arabic is assigned numerical
value (1–1,000) as follows (read from right to left):

The two calendars do not coincide, of course: the Islamic calendar is
lunar and is of 354 days, the months having twenty-nine or thirty
days, alternately. The Christian calendar corresponds to the Gregorian
calendar.

Trades and professions
The pattern -a- (doubled) aa-indicates ‘one professionally engaged
on some activity’.
Hence:
baker—khabbaaz
mason—Hajjaar
butcher—laHHaam
tentmaker—khayyaam
carpenter—najjaar
blacksmith—Haddaad
money changer—Sarraaf
coppersmith—naHHaas

Colours
The principal colours are all of the pattern ’a—a- (f. -a—aa).
red—’aHmar (pl. Humr)
black—’aswad (pl. sood)
white—’abyaD (pl. beeD)
green—’akhDar (pl. khuDr)
blue—’azra’ (pl. zur’)
yellow—’aSfar (pl. Sufr)
brown—’asmar(pl. sumr)
Feminines are of the pattern ’aHmar/Hamraa (hence the Alhambra
in Spain).
Other colours
brown—bunnee (coffee-coloured) pink—wardee (rose-coloured)

Shapes, areas etc.
Triangle—muthallath
circle—daa’ira
square—murabba9
cube—muka99ab

Numbers, powers etc.
odd number—9adad fardee
even number—9adad zawjee
a pair of shoes—zawj (jawz) kundara
a dozen—darzen
bilateral—thunaa’ee
trilateral—thulaathee
quadrilateral (quartet, quatrain)—rubaa9ee (e.g. of Omar
Khayyam)
five-fold (quintet)—khumaasee
six-fold (sextet)—sudaasee
seven-fold (septet)—subaa9ee
eight-fold (octet)—thumaanee
nine-fold (nonet)—tusaa9ee
ten-fold—’9ushaaree
Notice another pattern giving useful numerical ideas. From thalaa-
tha comes muthallath (triangle). Hence:

LESSON SEVENTEEN
109
muthanna—dual (grammar)
muthallath—triangle
murabba9—square
mukhammas—pentagon
musaddas—hexagon (but also ‘revolver’ i.e. ‘six-shooter’!)
9
What’s in a name?
Whereas English does not now use names such as Praise-the-Lord
Barebones, Arabic names always tell a story.
(a) Origins
Many family names are based on the place of origin: hence Hourani,
Shami, Trabulsi, Halabi, Nabulsi (to use American names of Levantine
origin).
(b) Qualities
Many personal names describe virtues.
kareem—generous
SaaliH—upright
saleem—sound
najeeb—of good stock
fareed—unique
naseeb—of noble descent
(There are many proverbs and stories illustrating discrepancy between
a name and its owner’s qualities!)
(c) Qualities to be avoided!
Names expressing defects may relate to the condition of an
eponymous ancestor, or may be given to ward off the affliction
referred to.
’aTrash—deaf ’a9war—one-eyed
(d) Trades and professions
(See section 5 above.)
Haddaad—blacksmith najjaar—carpenter

LESSON SEVENTEEN
110
(e)
Religious names
(i)
The largest category of names is that beginning with Abdul
(9abdul-), This means ‘the slave of…’, but the name is incomplete
without the addition of one of the ninety-nine Most Beautiful
Names of God. Hence:
9abdul-9azeez, 9abdul-kareem, 9abdul-majeed, 9abdul-waaHid
Although this group of names is usually given to Muslim males,
some Christians have names of this kind, either as personal or
family names. Abdullah (9abdullaahi) is used by both Christians and
Muslims.
(ii) Some names are clearly always Muslim: Muhammad, Ali,
Hussayn etc.
(iii) The Shia tend to prefer certain names over others: Ali, Hassan,
Hussayn.

11 The feminine ‘it’
As in many other languages a vaguely defined ‘it’ is rendered in the
feminine (cf. English, ‘You’ve had it!’, ‘It’s a mess!’). Below are examples
in Levantine colloquial.
 
 (i)
bifrij-haa ’allaah!—God will sort it out!
(ii)
Tuli9at’inno…—It turned out that…
(iii)
mndabbir-haa—We’ll fix things.

LESSON SEVENTEEN
111
 (iv) maa Tuli9at bi-eedo—He failed (lit. ‘It did not come up
into his hand’)
  (v) saa’abat inno…—It just happened that…
 (vi) khallee-haa 9alaynaa—This one’s on me (e.g. restaurant
bill)
(vii) maa btifri’ ma9ee—It makes no difference to me
(viii) takhkhanoo-haa—They overdid it/went too far
 (ix) halla’ ZabaTat—Now it’s turned out OK
  (x) maa misheeat—Things did not go well (lit. ‘It did not
walk’)
 (xi) ’akaloo-haa—They had a terrible time (lit. ‘They ate it’)
(xii) wa’t-haa, saa9at-haa, yawmit-haa—at that time, then
(xiii) mleeH innha maa kaanat ’a9Zam—A good thing things
were no worse
(xiv) bi-laa-haa—Never mind, forget it !
(xv) 9am bitshattee—It’s raining
12
The future negative
A common pattern is:
We shall not see him—mush Haa-nshoofo
Won’t you be coming?—mush Haa-teejee?
Haa is a truncated form of the colloquial future particle raaH.
13
Present tense negative
‘He is not…’ is frequently rendered in the Levant (especially Lebanon)
by maano(h)sh. This is (a) the negative maa, plus (b) the particle inn,
plus (c) the pronoun, plus (d) the negative suffix /sh/. Hence:
He is not here—maano(h)sh mawjood
The other pronouns may be substituted.
14
The double-possessive/object pronoun
A very common Lebanese formula is as follows:
Karim’s book—kitaabo la-kareem
Samira’s husband—jawz-haa la-sameera
He hit Samir—Darabo la-sameer

LESSON EIGHTEEN
112
15 ‘Arabic has no word for “interesting”’*
To round off this miscellany, the above myth should be finally laid to
rest.
What is true is that the English word ‘interesting’ does duty for
many words, even ‘boring’ (e.g. ‘How interesting!’). ‘An interesting
condition/person/book/evening/idea’ can all be rendered perfectly
adequately in Arabic, but no one word covers all the above cases.
Among translations for ‘interesting’ are mufeed, muhimm, lazeez, shayyi’,
mushawwi’ and mutheer lil-ihtimaam.
The student can judge the quality of English-Arabic dictionaries
by the number of Arabic words given for ‘interesting’.
LESSON EIGHTEEN
CONCEPTS IN SOCIETY
 
‘Let us pause to consider the…Levantines’—as Ogden Nash might
have said.
The Levant Arabic-speaking population includes a wide variety
of Christian sects (Uniate and Orthodox divisions of all the principal
Eastern communities, together with Roman Catholics and Protestants
of many persuasions) in addition to the predominantly Sunni Muslim
population. Of other Muslim communities there are many varieties:
Shia (‘Seveners’ and Twelvers’), Druze, Nusairis (Alawites) etc. Then
there are small communities of Arabic-speaking Jews, not to mention
members of the Bahai and other communities.
Since adherence to religious community is of fundamental
importance in the Levant (e.g. conflicts in 1979 in Syria between
Sunni and Alawite; the constitution of the Lebanese parliament,
Christian and Muslim in the ratio of 6 to 5; the name of the kingdom
of Jordan, ‘Hashemite’), it is not surprising that evidence of adherence
to community is found in speech. Indeed it is this area which gave
the word shibboleth to the English language: possibly the most famous
*‘cannot be adequately expressed in Arabic’: J. van Ess, The Spoken Arabic of Iraq,
2nd edn, Oxford, 1938, p. 162.

LESSON EIGHTEEN
113
example in world history of betrayal of community origins and belief
by a single word (see the Introduction).
The student should realize that knowledge of Arabic implies not
only knowledge of syntax and pronunciation but an awareness of
the dimension of concepts, i.e. the basic assumptions about society
which underlie the native speaker’s use of his language. Religion is
only one element, though a very obvious one: a Muslim may, in an
everyday ‘oath’, invoke the Prophet Muhammad, while a Christian
may invoke the Cross. The student will also come across ideas more
or less unfamiliar to him (depending on his own origins) relating to
family relationships, the constituent elements of society, neighbours,
what makes life worth living, the hereafter, sex, time, the position of
women, marriage, race, superstition, honour, politics, fate, birth, life
and death.
This lesson explains some of the language used in relation to
some of these concepts. A beginning may be made as follows.
Oaths
By comparison with British English, Levantine Arabic is extremely
rich in oaths. Whereas in the author’s lifetime ‘By God!’ and ‘By Jove!’
have declined in British use, Levantine speech has maintained its
traditional everyday oaths. A man may give extra emphasis to a
statement by saying:
 
1
wallaahee (il-9aZeem)!—By Almighty God! (Largely Muslim)
2
wa-Hyaat ’oolaadee!—By the life of my children!
3
wa-Hyaat in-nabee!—By the life of the Prophet! (Muslim)
4
wa-Hyaat il-maseeH!—By the life of Jesus the Messiah!
 (Christian)
5
wa-Hyaat 9uyoonee!—By the life of my eyes!
6
bi-sharafee!—By my honour!
7
wa-Hyaat il-’imaam 9alee—By the life of the Imam Ali!
(Shia)
8
wa-Hyaat haadol…(ish-shawaarib/il-9uyoon)!—By the life
of these…moustaches/eyes!
9
wa-Hyaat il-9adraa!—By the life of the Virgin! (Christian)
10
wa-Hyaat 9arDee!—By the life of my honour!

LESSON EIGHTEEN
114
Honour
sharaf and 9arD are used. The first tends to refer to generalized personal
or family standing, while the second has complex implications,
frequently to do with the honour of a family group as represented by
its women-folk (cf. T.Y.Awwad’s novel Death in Beirut, Heinemann
Educational Books, London, 1976, translated by the present writer).
In a famous incident, however, a Lebanese community leader was in
modern times presented at his front door with the head of a follower’s
sister with the words: ghasalna ishsharaf (‘We have washed clean the
(family) honour’).
Fate
It was written—maktoob!
It was a judgment of God and fate—qaDaa oo qadar!
Groups in society
Muslims (usage by non-Muslims)—il-’islaam
my ancestors (grandfathers)—’ujdoodee
my uncles (paternal)—9umoomtee
(maternal)—’akhwaalee
our group (can mean family or even religious community)—
jamaa9atnaa
What makes life worth living
Clearly an enormously broad field but any foreigner must be familiar
with a key phrase: keef oo basaT, approximately ‘good spirits and
cheer’.
Time
As is well known by rumour, the Arab’s approach to time is, at least,
more flexible than that of non-Arabs. Two phrases may be examined
to illustrate possible misunderstandings.
bukra is frequently taken by foreigners to mean ‘tomorrow’. To
a Levantine it may, quite sincerely, mean only ‘at some time in the

LESSON EIGHTEEN
115
future’. Indeed in Lebanon they say bukra 9aa-bukra for
‘tomorrow’.
fee hal-yawmayn—lit. ‘in these (next) two days’. Frequently the
Levantine means by this (apparently exact) phrase only ‘quite
soon’.
Women
Care must be taken to use the right term of reference or address.
Among phrases to be heard are:
is-sitt—the lady (i.e. your wife)
sitt-haanum—madame (with a Turkish honorific)
madaamtak—your wife (Lebanese, indeed Beiruti!)
martee—my wife (some groups would deplore this usage)
il-Hurma—my wife (used in very conservative circles, e.g. among
Bedu)
il-maHroosa—your daughter (lit. ‘the guarded one’)
mart-9ammee—my mother-in-law (lit. ‘the wife of my 
uncle’).
NB A euphemism is felt to be needed!
Marriage and divorce
The subject is so fundamental and attitudes are so varied that refuge
will be sought in brevity!
1
‘Divorce’ is Talaa’. A Muslim divorce (‘I divorce thee’ said three
times) is ’iT-Talaa’ bit-talaata. A bantering oath used to persuade
someone to do something is: T will divorce my wife!’ baTalli martee.
But note that Talla’t-haa can mean not only ‘I divorced her’ but ‘we
parted company’, e.g. two unmarried people. (The root T-1-’
means ‘be free’.)
2
NB a very revealing word:
He married X’s daughter—’akhad bint fulaan (lit. ‘He took X’s
daughter’)
3
Honeymoon. The phrase is an exact rendering of lune de miel or
‘honeymoon’: shahr il-9asl (‘month of honey’). The phrase used for
the wedding night is less ambiguous: laylat id-dakhla, lit. ‘the night
of the entering’.

LESSON EIGHTEEN
116
Race/community
Every community throughout the world likes to distinguish itself
from others by developing its own terms for referring to others:
hence ‘ethnic’ jokes and terms such as ‘paddies’, ‘jocks’, ‘limeys’ etc.
Levant society has its ‘ethnic’ jokes, though they tend to be directed
against the next village rather than against other countries, A certain
village in Lebanon refers to the next two villages in rhyming prose as
follows: ‘If it weren’t for—and—the world would be empty of morons’.
Two phrases which should be cleared up are:
1
il-9arab—lit. ‘the Arabs’
Depending on who says it, this may mean ‘non-Lebanese’, ‘the
Bedu’ or ‘member states of the Arab League’.
2
il-9abeed—lit. ‘the slaves’
This apparently offensive phrase is commonly used of blacks, even
of US citizens. It is best regarded as being like English titles such as
Tory, which were originally terms of abuse but have now more or
less lost their pejorative connotations.
Superstition
Levantine society has inherited a wealth of ideas which seem to be
irreconcilable with the degree of scientific education attained by
their adherents. Belief in ‘the evil eye’ is very widespread, and the
consultation of fortune tellers was attributed to 80 per cent of the
population of Lebanon in a survey in the late 1960s. Two common
phrases may illustrate this.
1
ba9eed 9annak—far from you
This is used to wish that the interlocutor may not be affected by
the unpleasant thing just mentioned: death, disease etc.
2
yikhza-l-9ayn—‘may He disgrace the (evil) eye’
This phrase may be used to express admiration for a handsome
child. NB In most Levantine societies it is not usual or welcome
for such admiration to be explicitly formulated, so as not to attract
the evil eye.

LESSON NINETEEN
117
Family reputation
It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of a family’s reputation. A
term of admiration is ibn-naas: ‘a son of people’, i.e. of people of
standing. To preserve a family’s standing periodic clan-gatherings are
common: a well-known Baalbek (Lebanon) extended family claims
22,000 members.
Revenge
Not only the Bedu insist on revenge; vendettas are endemic
throughout the Levant.
To take revenge—il-’akhd bit-taar (CA tha’r)
Influence
To end on a lighter note, all should be aware of the need for waaSTa,
lit. ‘mediation’.
In a society accustomed to leader-client relationships, modern
impersonal bureaucracy is intrusive. Dealings with government are
regarded as so fraught with perils that reliance can be placed only
on those known to the petitioner/citizen to have influence.
Hence the frequency of appeals for intervention made to
‘Godfather’ figures for assistance in getting passports, telephones
and permits of all kinds.
 
LESSON NINETEEN
ABUSE
 
A delicate subject!
1
It is inviting trouble to attempt to instruct a foreigner on how
to be abusive.
2
Below are examples of expressions which may be heard. These
are given for purposes of comprehension only. There is no
recommendation to use any of these phrases, still less to reply
to them!
