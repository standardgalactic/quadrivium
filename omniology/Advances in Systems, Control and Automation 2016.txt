Preface
Advances in Systems, Control and Automation is a collection of research articles
and critical review articles presented in the International Conference on ‘Emerging
Trends
and
Advances
in
Electrical
Engineering
and
Renewable
Energy
ETAEERE-2016,’ organized by the Department of Electrical and Electronics
Engineering (EEE) of Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology (SMIT), Majhitar,
Sikkim, India, during December 17–18, 2016. This was a very unique conference
which combined renewable energy, electronics, computing, communication, sys-
tems, controls and automations under one roof. Moreover, it is a matter of honor for
SMIT to learn that Springer was associated with ETAEERE-2016 as a major
publication sponsor for the event. The proceedings of this conference come out with
four different book volumes titled under Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering
(LNEE). The chapters cover the problems of multivariable control systems and
provide the necessary background for performing research in the ﬁelds of control
and automation. Aimed at helping readers understand the classical and modern
design of different intelligent automated systems, this book presents coverage on
the control of linear and nonlinear systems, intelligent systems, stochastic control,
knowledge-based systems applications, fault diagnosis and tolerant control,
real-time control applications, etc.
Eminent speakers like former Vice-Chancellor Prof. A Chakrabarti of Jadavpur
University; Prof. A Rajaraman of IIT Chennai; Prof. Gyoo-Shee Chae of Baekshok
University, South Korea; Prof. Avinash Konkani of University of Virginia, USA;
Prof. Kamani KK (the global economic advisor of Karnataka); Prof. Manjesh of
Bangalore University and Dr. Amitanshu Patnaik of DRDO Delhi shared their
knowledge and experience. The conference attended and presented by participants
from institutes such as IISc; IITs; NITs; NEHU; BIT; VIT; MIT Manipal; IIEST
Kolkata and abroad deliberated on their research works. In addition the paper
presentations were accompanied by six keynote addresses from leading academic
and industry researchers around the globe. The paper presentations took place in 3
different tracks with 18 parallel sessions. Through the platform of ETAEERE-2016,
we got the opportunity to promote the national campaign “Make In India.”

with High-Pass Filter by MATLAB
Simulation
Manjesh, A.S. Ananda, Akash Kumar Bhoi and K.S. Sherpa
Abstract This chapter proposes and evaluates the feasible method to minimize the
harmonic and its distortion. Many modern power systems incorporate different tech-
niques to eradicate the harmonics, and ﬁlters are widespread methods used all over the
world. Multi/polyphase power systems are trending because of improved performance
of the system by their inherent advantages over traditional single and three-phase
techniques [1]. The ﬁve-phase inverter is designed and studied with low-pass LC ﬁlter
to evaluate and eradicate the behavior of harmonics in the ﬁve-phase inverter.
Harmonics and THD comparison of the ﬁve-phase normal conﬁguration with high-pass
ﬁlter conﬁguration are analyzed practically, and the results are presented in this chapter.

three-phase power electronic scheme. Polyphase power electronic system has broad
applications in industries and aircraft applications because of its high torque and low
maintenance. Induction motor efﬁciency deteriorates and causes voltage imbalance in
the windings of the induction motor which in turngenerates dv/dt and ripple voltages at
converter and inverter output power electronic systems. Multi/poly phase system is
implemented in the applications of marines, powered vehicles (PVs) and hybrid
powered vehicles (HPVs), aviation, traction, and very high-voltage and current etc.
Polyphase power system has many advantages such as current reduction, reliable
during its fault operations, and also ripple current reduction at the output of the con-
verter system.
Many methods are reported in the prior research study for the injection of
harmonics, and the one among them is nonlinear load in the inverter. Eradication of
harmonics is considered as top priority in power quality improvement. Harmonics
appear at resonance in any power systems, both in parallel and in series forms.
Parallel resonance will effect in the ampliﬁcation of the output line voltage dis-
tortions and series resonance will effect in obnoxious maximum harmonic load
current. Nonlinear loads such as power switches in the inverter switching ON/OFF
at high speed will generate harmonics and EMIs. These harmonics are superim-
posed on the fundamental pure sine wave, cause adverse effect on the power system
performance by degrading the quality of the fundamental sine wave.
Power quality is optimized by suppressing the harmonics and to remove from
the power electronic system the harmonics ﬁlter technique is feasible and also
effective in power systems [12]. Passive and active are the two types of ﬁlters that
can remove the harmonics and THD. In the ﬁve-phase systems, present harmonic
orders are 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, etc., and ﬁfth and every multiple of ﬁfth harmonic
order are absent. The third harmonic order is the leading harmonic order which
degrades the performance. To remove the third harmonic order, a high-pass ﬁlter is
connected at the load stage of the inverter.
2
High-Pass Filter
There are three types of high-pass ﬁlter such as ﬁrst order, second order, and third
order. In the ﬁrst order, capacitor and resistor are used and the power losses are
more due to the presence of resistor. The second order is preferred by many
designers to remove the higher-order harmonics. The second-order high-pass ﬁlter
includes inductor, capacitor, and resistor, and a low resistor value leads to low
power dissipation. High-pass ﬁlter is designed to remove the third harmonic order.
The ﬁlter is designed to 15 Hz, and the capacitor (C), inductor (L), and resistor
(R) are calculated as follows:

Five-Phase Inverter
Inverter is constructed using ten power switches S1–S10, and MOSFET or IGBT can
be used as switches. Gating signals are programmed by pulse generators and
connected to the input gate of the IGBT’s as shown in Fig. 1. All the ten switches
are turned ON for the conduction period of 180° mode and having 72° out of phase
with each other. Ten switching modes are programmed using pulse generator as
depicted in Fig. 2. At Mode-1, switches S1S3S5S7S9 will conduct; similarly, at
Mode-2, S6S8S10S2S4 will conduct.
Five-phase inverter drive is constructed with high-pass ﬁlter to eliminate the
harmonics as shown in Fig. 2.
The calculated values of inductors L1–L5, capacitors C1–C5, and resistors R1–R5
in high-pass ﬁlter are shown in Table 1.

magnitude, that simply super imposed on the fundamental harmonic, it might be
adverse effect on the performance of the ﬁve-phase inverter and also the harmonic
reduction with THD has been analyzed and obtained the results. The comparison of
harmonics and total harmonic distortion has been presented with normal ﬁve-phase
PWM inverter and ﬁve-phase inverter using high-pass ﬁlter. It is found that the
harmonics and THD are found to be less using high-pass ﬁlter. This work is used to

Akash Kumar Bhoi, Vinay Gupta and Basudev Prasad
Abstract This chapter deals with the electrical and optical properties of ZnS by
using the ﬁrst principle plane-wave pseudopotential technique [ab initio Technique].
The obtained results show that the bandgap of ZnS system becomes narrow under
the transition state condition, and also it changes the conductivity of ZnS from
semiconductor to metal behavior. Zinc sulﬁde is a direct bandgap-type non-toxic
semiconductor
material.
Moreover, it is used
as an optical device. The
above-mentioned properties show that the ZnS is a favorable candidate for luminous
materials as well as solar photovoltaic cell. Doping of rare earth element and tran-
sition element in ZnS is used as a good phosphor material.

Introduction
The non-toxic and wide bandgap semiconductor materials of the II–VI group such
as zinc sulﬁde, zinc selenide, cadmium selenide, and cadmium sulﬁde are used as
photo and electroluminescence materials. Zinc sulﬁde has a direct and wide
bandgap semiconductor material (3.73 eV) along with the large band energy of
exciton (37 meV). The above-mentioned properties signify that zinc sulﬁde is a
favorable material for optical devices like ultraviolet LEDs [1–3], ﬂat-panel dis-
plays [4, 5], solar photovoltaic cells [6], and sensor devices [7]. Zinc sulﬁde is an
inorganic material which is in the form of sphalerite (cubic form) or zinc blende and
wurtzite (hexagonal form). The material is an intrinsic semiconductor with a wide
bandgap of about 3.54 eV for a cubic form of ZnS and 3.91 eV for hexagonal form.
Such types of semiconductors are suitable for the analysis of discrete energy level
states in the bandgap [2, 8, 9].
The optical, electrical, and electronic properties of semiconductors are likely to
be characterized by the help of reﬂectivity, absorption spectra, and vibrational
spectroscopy. The above optical constants depend upon photosensitive bandgap of
the material.
In this work, the band structure, the density of states (DOS), dielectric functions,
refractive index, absorption spectra, reﬂectivity, optical conductivity, and vibra-
tional spectroscopy of ZnS are studied by the help of plane-wave pseudopotential
method using density functional theory (DFT).
2
Computational Study by CASTEP
The computational study of zinc sulﬁde is performed by using the software code
CASTEP [10] in the frame of density functional theory (DFT) with generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) as
exchange functional [11–14]. The collaborations between ion and electron are
represented by norm-conserving pseudopotentials for Zn and S atoms [15]. All the
computing properties of ZnS used 380 eV as plane wave basis set cut-off energy,
and k-point is 1  1  1 Monkhorst–Pack [16] grid for the selection of the
Brillouin zone. Geometrical optimization is conducted that 5  10−6 eV atom−1:
convergence thresholds for the total energy, 0.01 eV Å−1: the maximum force,
0.02 Gpa: maximum stress and 5  10−4 Å: maximum displacement under the
transition state method for DFT-D connections. BFGS method is used in a geo-
metric optimization of ZnS [17, 18]. The space group number of sphalerite ZnS is
F-43 M (216) [19, 20].
Generally in the study of the interface between light and matter, adiabatic and
only electron approximation is used. The effect of phonon interaction in the tran-
sition process whether the intraband and interband is ignored since the transition
frequency  phonon frequency. According to the transition probabilities and

Kramers–Kronig dispersion process, it can analyze the different optical properties
like absorption spectra, dielectric functions, reﬂectivity, refractive index, and
vibrational spectroscopy.
The optical response of the semiconductor can be deﬁned by the complex
dielectric function e(x) = e(x)real ± e(x)imaginary where e1(x) = e(x)real and e2
(x) = e(x)imaginary are given below Eqs. (1) and (2) [21].

Computational Results and Analysis
3.1
Band Structure and Electronic Density of States
In Fig. 1, the Brillouin zone path is used to compute the bandgap of ZnS. The line
at zero signiﬁes the fermi level. From the ﬁgure of band structure, it can be seen that
the ZnS has formed the crystalline of pure zinc blende or sphalerite. It is observed
that ZnS has a direct bandgap-type semiconductor at G point of Brillouin zone. The
calculated Eg [Band Gap Energy], 1.317 eV, which is lower than the experimental
Eg [Band Gap Energy] value 3.68 eV. The above-mentioned difference in values
due to DFT uses the ground state, whereas the energy gap lies in the excited state.
The difference in calculation does not affect the computational study of ZnS [16].
From Fig. 1, it is known that the valence band of ZnS consists of lower valance
band, i.e., −5.5 to −7.4 eV and higher valence band, i.e., −4.4 to 0 eV. The DOS
sharp peak is obtained at −6.4 eV of valance band side.

3.2
Complex Dielectric Function
The dielectric function (e) is a complex quantity which is divided into two parts,
i.e., real and imaginary, which is known as the complex dielectric function
eðxÞ ¼ eðxÞreal  eðxÞimaginary
h
i
. Where, e(x)real signiﬁes that the material becomes
polarized under the electric ﬁeld, and e(x)imaginary represents the absorption in a
semiconductor material. In Fig. 2, the energy is in the range of 0.8–15 eV. In a
metal, the induced dipole oscillations are likely to be large as well as it can absorb the
energy from the applied ﬁeld. E(x)imaginary becomes important at the time of
absorption as well as it must be nonzero under absorption. It is important that the

shape of e(x)real is responsible for the changes in the shape of e(x)imaginary and vice
versa. This is called as the Kramers–Kronig relation for complex dielectric function.
The dielectric function and refractive index are associated with the material by the
equation e = n2 = n ± j k. Figure (2) shows that the photon energy is responsible
for the change of n [real] and k [imaginary] of the complex dielectric function. It can
be seen that the n of the dielectric constant increases with photon energy. It touches
its maximum point at 3.2 eV and after that it decreases continuously with the energy
rise of photon varies in between 4.2 and 7.4 eV.
3.3
Absorption Spectrum
The absorption coefﬁcient [a] deﬁnes an attenuation of light strength in percentage
per units of distance traveling through the medium. The absorption spectrum of ZnS
is given via the Eq. (3) [2, 8, 9, 22] as follows:
a 	 2xK
c
¼ 4pK
k0
ð3Þ
Figure 3 displays that the absorption becomes zero at the energy 
 1.2 eV and
 19.6 eV. When the energy of photon  1.2 eV, then the absorption coefﬁcient
[a] is increasing up to the maximum peak intensity on 300,000 cm−1 at 8.2 eV.
Subsequently, it drops to zero with the rise of photon energy  8.2 eV. It can be
concluded from Fig. 3 that ZnS has an absorption coefﬁcient in the range 105 cm−1
along with a very actuate cutoff response in the spectrum of UV.

3.4
Refractive Index
The link between refractive index and dielectric function mentioned in below
equations [11, 15–17, 21, 23, 24]. Those are as follows:
eðxÞ ¼ eðxÞreal  eðxÞimaginary
ð4Þ
NðxÞ ¼ nðxÞ  jðxÞ
ð5Þ
eðxÞreal ¼ n2  k2
ð6Þ
eðxÞimaginary ¼ 2nk
ð7Þ
[Note: ‘n’ is the refractive index and ‘k’ is the extinction coefﬁcient].
The refractive index of ZnS is shown in Fig. 4. The maximum peak lies at
3.2 eV. It is seen that the maximum peak changed with the increase and decrease of
photon energy. e1(x) and e2(x) show its peaks lie at 3 and 8.5 eV, respectively. It
intersects the real axis at 7.2 and 15.0 eV. 7.2 eV is called as resonance frequency
(indicated as x0), whereas 15.0 eV is a plasma frequency (indicated as xp).
3.5
Reﬂective Spectra
The correlation of the reﬂectivity R(x) and complex refractive index can be
obtained from the below Eq. (8) [13, 14, 21]

Figure 5 represents the reﬂectivity spectrum of ZnS. It is seen that the reﬂective
spectra are very strong in the range of 7–16 eV. From Fig. 5, it can be concluded
that ZnS shows metal reﬂective properties.

Optical Conductivity
Optical conductivity is the ratio of the current density to the electric ﬁeld of a
material, and it results due to the increase and decrease of illumination [2]. The
complex optical conductivity [r(x) = r1(x) ± jr2(x)] is shown in Fig. 6. The real
part [r1 (x)] of optical conductivity becomes zero when it lies at 
 1.5 eV and
 16 eV. Its maximum peak lies at 7.5 eV. The imaginary part becomes negative at
the beginning, and it intersects at 8 eV.

Energy Loss Function
The energy loss function deﬁnes the loss which is occurred by energy when the
electron cross through a homogenous dielectric ﬁeld. It can be calculated from
Eq. (9) [10, 11, 15–17, 21, 23, 24].

The energy loss function peak signiﬁes its characteristic along with the oscil-
lation of plasma frequency. Figure 7 shows the spectra of ZnS energy loss function.
It can be noticed that the highest peak lies at 15.0 eV which is the plasma energy of
ZnS.

Vibrational Spectroscopy
Raman and infrared (IR) spectroscopies are known as vibrational spectroscopy, and
it is used for analysis and characterization of the spectrum within the region of
0.3–5 THz. The requirement of vibrational spectroscopy is to calculate the phonon
frequencies, phonon displacement patterns as well as intensities of Raman and IR
spectra [25].

Molecular crystals can be analyzed by Raman spectrum. Here in Fig. 8, the
highest active mode lies at 194 cm−1 whose maximum activity is 3.4 A4.
There are many ways to get the information regarding the functional group of
inorganic crystals. IR spectroscopy is one of the vibrational spectroscopies which
can provide the functional group or to measure the vibration of phonons. In
Fig. 9, we got the peak of 2192 km/Mole at 338 cm−1 frequency. In Fig. 9, it
shows that ZnS has far-infrared spectrum, where its wave number lies in between
−500 to 500 cm−1.

Conclusion
The bandgap, DOS, and optical characteristics consisting of the absorption coef-
ﬁcient, reﬂectivity, conductivity, energy loss, vibrational spectroscopy, and
refractive index of ZnS are measured which are based upon a plane-wave pseu-
dopotential method. The outcomes show that ZnS is a wide bandgap-type material.
So it can be concluded that the computational results of ZnS have a structure of
cubic, and the bandgap of ZnS becomes narrow under the speciﬁed condition as
compared to theoretical one.

Abstract The heterogeneous e-learning materials are generated in the progress of
online e-learning technique. The system of e-learning is providing huge opportu-
nities for learning online for learners with enhanced and efﬁcient practices of
learning. The system of e-learning needs to cater for the individual learner
requirements including learner’s proﬁle and activities of learning in the form of tree
structure. There are several issues of pedagogical learning. In case of learning
phenomenon, this is too difﬁcult for any learner or user to select their suitable
learning resources without having exact background knowledge. To address these
issues, this research is proposing two enhanced techniques called as Hybrid
Fuzzy-based Matching Recommendation Algorithm and Collaborative Sequential
Map Filtering Algorithm. This proposed approach recommends a new method to
assist users on their individual as well as collaborative learning methods for
accessing learning resources.

Introduction
The development in communication and Web-based information technologies has
indeed popularized e-learning system among educational institutions. The acceptance
of e-learning system has altered the conventional learning procedures of learners
(students) and offers a new condition to them, which greatly enhances and supports
online learning. In the advent of different learning methodologies (element of

understanding [1], such as learning resources, subjects, and other relevant content) in the
online learning platform, students are ﬁnding it difﬁcult to choose appropriate learning
activity that better suits their needs. In this era of big data, problem due to overloading of
information has been increasingly acute. It is necessary that e-learning platform should
generate tailor-made suggestions with minimal manual intervention to help learners’
activities [2], and as suggested by Lu [3], an “E-Learning Recommender System”
should ideally generate personalized recommendations. This paper strives to develop an
approach to help learners to select the most perfect learning method in online learning
system. The paper proposes Collaborative Sequential Map Filtering Algorithm and
Hybrid Fuzzy-based Matching Recommendation Algorithm. The former uses the ben-
eﬁts of collaborative ﬁltering and knowledge-based suggestion methods. Let us learn the
similarities exist between learners for both collaborative ﬁltering and sequential mapping
learning methods [4]. While analyzing the similarities of collaborative ﬁltering, instead
of using the common learning activities, the grades of matched learning actions are taken
into consideration. A learner’s need is usually mentioned as “very important or highly
required.” Techniques such as fuzzy sets can handle such category data which are
uncertain. Fuzzy logic [5] is ideal for making decisions relied on fuzzy classiﬁcation.
The aim is to provide a tailor-made e-learning method with the help of techniques
known as sequential mapping and collaborative ﬁltering. The integrated ﬁltering method
[6] has been followed.

Related Work
Several researches have been undertaken in the e-learning ﬁeld. In one such research
undertaken to understand a better way of learning, [7] proposed that e-learning can be
enhanced using two features: one that focused on learner interest, and two that
focused on background knowledge. When hybrid and content-based approaches were
compared, [7] found the hybrid collaborative ﬁltering method not only outperformed
Web-based educational systems in adaption and personalization, but it also lowered
computational costs. Baylari and Montazer [8] proposed the development of a
multiple e-learning platform that could include adopting tests runs on IRT (item
response theory), and ANN (artiﬁcial neural networks). Another method by [9]
sought to include two modules that incorporated content-based and collaborative
ﬁltering approaches so that learners could access automatically recommendations
based on their recent activities without seeking feedbacks online. For this, an ofﬂine
module containing the names of learners and their content is compared with online
modules to suggest what kind of content satisﬁes a learner’s needs or goals. In any
form of learning, recommendations and feedbacks are necessary, and it is the same
with online learning as well. Keeping this in mind, [10] introduced Comtella-D
wherein, a learner’s history of learning could be retrieved to design an appropriate
strategy for him or her based on their input data. In one such experiment, it assessed
that collaborative ﬁltering techniques could indeed be successful when tested on
discussion forums. Garcia et al. [11] went a step further and designed a data mining
apparatus to assist non-expert educators to improve their online teaching methods by

sharing and studying their outcomes with other non-expert educators. However,
considering that there would be dynamic interests, multi-preferences, and varied
interests among these non-expert educators, [12] proposed the sequencing of data
using algorithms such as “Apriori” and “Preﬁx Span” to identify latent patterns to
access learning content. However, [13] wanted a simpler and uniﬁed approach to
understanding a learner’s learning preference and sought to introduce a CT (compact
tree) approach. Salehi and Nakhai Kamalabadi’s [13] method outperformed the
earlier algorithmic calculations in terms of its accuracy, recalls, and listings.

Hybrid Fuzzy Tree Matching Recommendation
By introducing a suitable learning mechanism, students will be able to learn more
effectively online. This work is proposing the idea of data uploading in cloud server
side, while learners are trying to access the data. By giving query to e-learning
system, the learner can retrieve the similar data by using sequential mapping pro-
cess. It is classifying the data from cloud server and then classiﬁed data ﬁltered by
collaborative ﬁlter based on similarity. The relevance data are recommended to user
with the help of hybrid fuzzy tree matching (Fig. 1).
Learners’ proﬁles are stored in the system administrator, and it can be ﬁltered
using a password. It is a user’s proﬁle that determines his or her learning prefer-
ences. Similarly, a learner’s proﬁle can be used to retrieve details of other learners
with similar interests, otherwise called as the learner’s neighborhood.
The activities of learners are an activity of periodical learning performing a
complied proposed subject or the request of instructor likewise: group discussion on
speciﬁc topic, chat on speciﬁc topic, online video for any speciﬁc topic, etc.,
producing the resources of e-learning within several different types of supports.
The matching approach of fuzzy system has been proposed for evaluating the
concept similarity. As per the requirement of students and material information of
learning system seen over the concept, the approach of fuzzy matching is com-
pletely suitable to ﬁnd out the learning material recommendation based on the
requirement of students. The given component, requirement set Ri of a particular
student xi implies association rule to form Ri Li, (calculate Li on the basis of Ri),
where the learning material Li is set of learning material taxonomy subject. The
component task is for ﬁnding the set of material for e-learning Li = (li1, li2, …, lik)
for student xi, the functionality lim could be either one or one class for material of
learning at similar level that is matching with the fuzzy technique function Ri.
3.1
Matching Algorithm
Using the matching rule of fuzzy system for discovering the association relation
between students and their requirements, the component would be generating a
recommendation material of personalized learning list for (N materials) for every
student. This proposed component is addressing that how to determine the value of
“N” for the top-N e-learning recommendation material and recommendation format.

Collaborative Sequential Mapping Algorithm
3.2.1
Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative ﬁltering is an important strategy in the recommender system. The
technique of collaborative ﬁltering for e-learning is based on grouping of common
interests of learners. The approaches are broadly divided into three categories. They
are: i) learner’s activities such as material, ii) materials uploaded by tutor, and iii)
collaborative material. Collaborative e-learning platforms are fast growing, making
them an irreplaceable provider of learning materials. The user preferences are col-
lected and are propagated aggressively through word-of-mouth recommendations.
3.2.2
Efﬁcient Collaborative Filter Algorithm
The proposed algorithm, efﬁcient collaborative ﬁltering, is to ﬁlter the proﬁle of
learner and the activity of learner through cloud database.

3.2.3
Sequential Mapping
Several factors are considered by the learner when he selects a learning activity
such as his background, goals, and choice of learning categories. These factors are
comprised of several sub-factors, which eventually takes a tree structure. Learners
most likely express their requirements with linguistic terms in real-time applica-
tions. This may include phrases like “Highly Required.” A fuzzy set technique
might be suitable in handling the linguistic terms.
3.3
Personal Recommendation System
In this system, information such as learner’s demographics and previous education,
goals, and choice of learning categories are recorded during the registration and
learning process. Most importantly, the planned careers of the learners are noted
from the predeﬁned career list (Fig. 2).
3.4
Cloud Database Storage
The cloud database stores all information about learning objects and user. The layer
of database includes the knowledge library of current user’s or learner’s, the object of
learning resources, the assessment score of learner’s, and rules mining through the
algorithm of sequential mapping. The knowledge library of current users or learners
is having the behavior of each and every learner’s and other all relevant properties
including knowledge ID of current learning, learning time, and learning level.
3.5
Hybrid Fuzzy-Based Matching Recommendation
Algorithm
The proposed rule of fuzzy matching is being used to ﬁnd out the materials of
learning that matches to learner’s requirement. The taxonomy of learning material is
being represented as structure of tree classifying the low-level set of learning material
into high-level set of learning material. The tree leaves are denoting instances of
learning material, and non-leaf nodes are denoting the material of learning obtained
through the combination of lower level nodes within one parent node.

Result and Discussion
For carrying experimentation of the proposed approach, a system consisting of
Windows 7 or XP operating system with i3 processor with 2-GB RAM and 500-GB
hard disk drive with Java for implementation of recommendations using hybrid
fuzzy tree matching is needed.
In Table 1, a new registered user is shown as Learner 5 and a subject, and study
material design is shown as S8. The subjects recommended by the system for
Learners 4 and 5 will be generated in the paper. Alternative subjects for Learners 4
and 5 are also calculated.
The recommendations alternatives are selected for Learners 4 and 5 based on the
SMCF similarity degrees calculated between learners.

Figure 3 shows number of user proﬁle; User activities and user preferences are
also used by the proposed work based on HFTMA algorithm. This proposed
algorithm is HFTMA; it is compared with background fuzzy tree structure algo-
rithm. Finally, result is showing new proposed system (96) better than existing
system (90).
The results shown in Fig. 4 indicate that the proposed new system is more
efﬁcient than the existing one due to the use of collaborative ﬁltering sequential
mapping process for ﬁnding similarities of activities.
Table 2 shows comparison between the proposed system with the existing
system where “v” represents recommended system. It is seen from Table 2, the
developed HFTMA will be able to handle more complex data in comparison with
background e-learning recommender system.
Figure 5 shows the process of existing and proposed system. When compared to
existing system, the proposed system, hybrid fuzzy tree matching recommendation,
is high based on time between learners’ materials and learners’ activities. The
technical processes of existing and proposed systems are shown in Fig. 5, while
parameter performances are shown in Fig. 6. On comparison, it is seen that the
proposed system has high reliability, quality, and efﬁciency.

Conclusion
Based on user’s or learner’s proﬁle and activities, the proposed technique of Hybrid
Fuzzy-based Matching Recommendation Algorithm and Collaborative Sequential
Map Filtering Algorithm gives an accurate e-learning recommendation compared to
knowledge-based recommendation. This is due to the tree-structured fuzzy-based
learning activity model in the proposed system within learner’s proﬁle model which
is responsible for the improved recommendation system. The fuzzy system pro-
poses a similarity model within collaborative sequential ﬁltering. This model makes
evaluation of similarity measurements in respect of learning activity and learner’s
proﬁle. It is seen that the proposed system is very fast and gives an accurate results
of user’s query and requirement. In addition, the proposed approach is compatible
with different types of data such as text, audio, video, pdf, and images.

Tension Controllers for a Strip Tension
Levelling Line
Daniel Magura, Viliam Fedák, Padmanaban Sanjeevikumar
and Karol Kyslan
Abstract Strip material processed in continuous production lines causes a
mechanical coupling among tension rolls driven by a multi-motor drive system.
Thus, the drives are mutually mechanically coupled and inﬂuenced in their oper-
ation. One of the key techniques, to guarantee the output product quality in the
ﬁbre, paper, plastic and metal plating industries, consists in controlling the strip
tension on a preset value that should be set differently for each section of the line.
This paper describes two newly developed types of tension controllers: a tension
controller with the ramp and a stepper tension controller, which are suitable for the
line sections with high and low level of the tension, respectively. The proposed
controllers were veriﬁed experimentally on a real tension levelling line.

Introduction
During technological process in strip processing lines, the processed material
changes its mechanical properties. Strip causes mechanical coupling of motors, and
thus, they are mutually inﬂuenced in their operation. In manufacture and processing
of continuous strips such as paper products, plastic ﬁlms, metal foils and rubber
proﬁles, it is important to maintain the tension and the speed of the strip at the set
point values between consecutive pairs of driving rolls. In order to achieve required
quality of the outgoing strip, the tension in the strip and its elongation in each line
section should be kept within speciﬁed, preset boundaries. Unprecise tension
control may result in deterioration of the material quality, strip deformation or even
in a strip breaking.
From the technological point of view, the tension in the strip should be kept at
constant, preset value, regardless variations of the strip speed. Several control
methods to keep the constant tension are known, [1–6]. The authors in [1] present
the tension control using PI controller, where variable parameters of the controller
are calculated according to the diameter of the rolls, inertia and strip speed. In [2], a
strip tension controller based on feedback information about the position difference
between two rollers is proposed. The tension controller is implemented in parallel
with the speed controller and improves dynamic reaction to changes in the strip
tension.
Complex systems usually require the involvement of fuzzy tension controllers,
but for users it is troublesome to modify the table of the fuzzy controller, [3]. The
authors [4] have published a methodology for a self-tuning fuzzy controller, in
which the control parameters can be changed so that the whole system has sufﬁcient
stability and performance in the presence of variable system parameters or structure
uncertainty. Some methods, based on implementation of observer techniques
replacing tension transducers, were published in [5, 6]. Such solution is suitable for
low-cost applications. The authors [7] have realized a control algorithm for con-
tinuous line designed on the basis of the II. Lyapunov method in laboratory
environment.
One of the key problems in processing the strips is to get ﬂat-rolled products of
high ﬂatness quality. Strip shape equipment—ﬂatteners or levellers—generally
presents the heart of most manufacturer’s or service centre’s coil processing lines
[8]. The quality of unﬂattened strips can be improved in strip tension levelling lines,
the main part of which is a tension leveller [9].
The goal of this paper consists in presenting two developed tension controllers,
which can be used in various applications of the direct strip tension control: for the
line sections with high tension, a tension controller with the ramp was developed,
and for the line sections with low tensions, a stepper tension controller is intro-
duced. The operation of both controllers has been veriﬁed practically at experi-
mentation on a strip tension levelling line for aluminium sheets.

Description of the Strip Levelling Line
A tension levelling line is divided by material storages into three parts (Fig. 1)
containing the following machines:
• Entry section:
– Uncoiler(s),
– Side trimmer,
– Strip connecting station (joiner).
• Strip processing section:
– Annealing section (oven),
– Tension leveller—Levelﬂex,
– Cleaning section.
• Exit section:
– Inspection table,
– Drum shear,
– Recoiler(s).
Arrangement of the machines in the line (arrangement of working and transport
rolls) depends on application and customer requirements: some machine changes
directly mechanical properties of the strip material (e.g. at annealing, or in rolling
mills), the other ones deal with the surface treatment (cleaning—pickling, galva-
nization, zinciﬁcation, coating, straightening, etc.), or serve for manipulation of the
processed strip—its transport, loading the strip into the line, accumulation/storage
of the strip, connecting its endings, cutting the strips, etc.
The rolls and the working machines are mutually bounded by the processed
strip. From the technology of strip processing, it follows that a different tension in
the strip is required in each from the line sections.
In the analysed line, the block “Technological Process” in Fig. 1 contains a part
of the line with an annealing oven because during cold rolling (prior entering the
Fig. 1 Diagram of a continuous strip levelling line
Tension Controllers for a Strip Tension Levelling Line
35

strip into the analysed line), the aluminium strip solidiﬁes, has residual stress and
must be annealed to regain its formability for further processing.
From the point of view of tension levelling technology description, it follows
that there are two types of the line sections: high strip tension and low strip tension.
For each from these categories, we have developed a special tension controller:
(1) The sections in which tensions in the strip reach the highest values (high
tensions) which are necessary for getting the strip with the high ﬂatness. Such
sections usually occur in the entry and output sections of the line (in case of
aluminium strip having the tensions of r = 5–10 MPa) and in levelling section
(with very high tensions of r = 15–70 MPa) consisting of a roller levelling
device and bridles (tension rolls). The designed tension controller is described
in the Sect. 3.2.
(2) The sections with low-level tensions (low tensions) what is the case of a
technological section inside (in our case an annealing oven with a long length
section—about 100 m, where the strip is supported by hot compressed air and
the tension reaches values round r = 1 MPa). The designed tension controller
is described in the Sect. 3.3.
Proposed structures of these tension controllers were successfully implemented
for the control of tensions in the line sections of a strip levelling line produced by
company BWG.
3
Tension Control
The basic formula used for calculation of a required strip tension is based on the
relationship between the tension Fp acting on the roll on the motor torque MT [8]:
MT ¼ Fp  R
ð1Þ
where R is radius of the tensional roll.
Except of the torque MT causing the tension in the strip, the total motor torque
consists also from the acceleration component J dx
dt


and friction component ðMTrÞ.
When considering the gear ratio j for creating the required tension F, the motor
must develop the torque:
MM ¼ 1
j MT þ 1
j2 J dx
dt þ MTr
ð2Þ
Having to disposal measured mechanical losses and moment of inertia of each drive
in the line then, in an ideal case, the actual value of the tension should correspond to the
required value of the tension in the section between the working rolls [10].
36
D. Magura et al.

Of course, in the praxis it is impossible to measure nor to obtain mechanical
losses (depending also on the strip speed) within the whole speed range and
simultaneously also to consider the temperature of the motors and the environment,
material friction nor friction in the bearings. For this reason, to control the strip
tension, the tension controllers are used.
3.1
PI Tension Controller
At ﬁrst, let us consider dynamical properties of a classical PI tension controller
presenting the simplest controller that is often used in the tension control circuit. Its
advantage consists in its easy implementation—it is usually implemented in the
library of each digital control system, and thus, one does not need to program it.
The controller can be set up and tuned directly on place at commissioning of the
line. Its tuning does not require any extra burden but sometimes it is necessary to
modify or adapt the controller parameters according to variable speed of the strip
and/or for various materials of different quality and cross sections.
Another problem the PI controller meets presents an oscillating value of the
tension signal on its input, which is measured or estimated from other process
variables. This also causes oscillations of the PI controller output value which gives
rise to undesirable oscillations that are led into the motor torque limiter. In praxis,
we try to avoid using a classic PI controller with constant parameters for the control
of the strip tension. It is more advantageous to use developed simple tension
controllers, as presented in this paper.
3.2
Tension Controller with Ramp Generator
We use this kind of controller for controlling the high tensions in the strip. These
occur in the straightening section of the line in Fig. 2.
Fig. 2 Scheme of arrangement of the drives in central part of the analysed continuous strip
processing line
Tension Controllers for a Strip Tension Levelling Line
37

The notation P11, P12 … P31 presents drive bridles (the tension rolls). The
tensions in the strip between these drives reach high values. Satisfactory control
results can be obtained with a controller that gradually changes the required value
of the tension in the line section (smoothly or by slow changes) in time instants,
when the actual value tension reaches the set point value within a band of hysteresis
(set up by the programmer). The smoothly changed value is generated by a ramp
generator. In our tension levelling line, it is allowed that the preset tension can vary
within the boundaries of ±1%, what means that a controller having a constant
control deviation can be also used.
The controller scheme is shown in Fig. 3. We have named the presented
structure as a tension controller with ramp. The control deviation X is compared to
the value M which is set to zero in order to keep the control deviation at zero value.
Figure 4 shows the function of the block comparing the value with hysteresis.
Fig. 3 Tension controller equipped by a ramp generator
Fig. 4 Comparator principle
38
D. Magura et al.

The ramp generator principle of operation is shown in Fig. 5. If the signal
CU = 1, the output of ramp generator is raised; if CU = 0 and CD = 0, the output
of the ramp generator does not change.
The ramp generator output is multiplied by the tension, and the signal is divided
among the drives to compensate arose control deviation. In our control system, the
output from the ramp generator is multiplied by a constant presenting 20% of the
sum of all maximal possible tensions for the drives P22, P23 and P24. This constant
corresponds to the maximum actuating controller intervention. It also depends on
precise measurement of mechanical loses in the line equipment and correct esti-
mation of the inertia of rotating parts. The value of 20% has been estimated
empirically for the given line having certain parameters.
The entire controller structure is designed for a four-drive system, as shown in
Fig. 2. One of the drives works as a lead one—the master drive (drive P21 in
Fig. 2). It is a speed-controlled drive without torque limitation, i.e. the torque
limiter is set to maximum. Its function is to keep strip elongation on a required
value according to the preset speed value.
The signal from the tension controller presents an additional tension signal for
the drives P22, P23 and P24. The block Tension dividing divides the actuating
intervention of the controller among the adjacent drives.
Based on the production technology, partition of the tension among the drives
can be done by operator/programmer himself in time of commissioning the line.
Two conditions to be considered are to take in the consideration the power rating of
the drives and to ensure that the tensions in the line satisfy the condition (3):
F21 [ F22 [ F23 [ F24
ð3Þ
i.e. the master drive should develop the highest tension, and thus, it has the highest
torque.
The experimental results from a real line are shown in Fig. 6. It can be observed
that the initial transport speed of the strip v = 5 m/min was changed by the operator
Fig. 5 Ramp generator
principle
Tension Controllers for a Strip Tension Levelling Line
39

to the value of v = 20 m/min within a short-time interval. In the time instant, when
the tension mode was switched on, the output signal from the controller has
increased (the trace Tension Controller Ramp). The reference value of the tension
was set to the value of r = 22 N/mm2 by the superimposed control loop. During the
tension mode, the tension in the line was kept on approximately constant value (the
trace TM4 ActTen).
During the ﬁrst measurement on the real line, the deviation from the set value
was
Dr = 0.24 N/mm2
and
during
the
second
measurement
it
was
Dr = 0.18 N/mm2. Note that the relative elongation during a run at the constant
speed is not constant. We suppose this is caused by changes of the material
properties.
3.3
Stepper Tension Controller
In case a low tension in the strip is required, we have designed another solution. As
an example for such a case, an annealing oven for the aluminium strips serves here.
The length of the strip in the oven is 100 m. The mechanical arrangement of the
Fig. 6 Time responses of the variables in line with the ramp tension controller (for the labeling of
the curves see Table 1).
40
D. Magura et al.

drives in the input part of the oven is shown in Fig. 7. The tension in the strip
coming out from the accumulator is high, and it is decreased by a tension section
consisting of four drives working in the generator mode.
The value of the tension F25 in the oven is as follows:
F25 ¼ F21  T21  T22  T23  T24
ð4Þ
where the variable Tij presents a tension corresponding to the developed torque by
the drive Pij. It consists of two components: the calculated contribution of the
torque (a portion of the total required torque for four drives) and signal corre-
sponding to the additional tension from the tension controller. The variable F21
presents the strip tension in the output from the accumulator.
For such an arrangement of the section, a stepper tension controller was
developed as shown in Fig. 8. Its operation is based on increasing or decreasing of
the set tension value in steps: the controller works until the control deviation is
lower than the preset range. If any difference between the set and actual number of
impulses occurs, the controller increases or decreases its output. The output from
the counter is multiplied by the tension, and then, it is divided among the drives
which control the arisen control deviation.

The described low-tension controller was applied in the control system of the
drives in the annealing oven, and the main variables were recorded in Fig. 9, where
labeling of the curves is listed in Table 2. During measurement, the set value of
tension in the strip was adjusted to the value 1 N/mm2 and the tension was con-
trolled with the maximum control deviation of ±0.1 N/mm2.
It can be observed in Fig. 9 that the control deviation between reference tension
FU_Set_Ten and the actual tension in the oven TM2_ActTen really does not exceed
value of ±0.1 N/mm2. The step value of the tension controller output is led into

the tension)

control circuits of the drives changing the motor torques, and thus, the tension in the
strip is also changed.
It is advantageous to use the described stepper controller in cases when opera-
tional intervention of the controller allows a slow change of the controlled variable
or when the time of the system response is not known or when this time depends on
various other parameters (temperature in the oven, the strip speed, strip cross
section).

Conclusion
This paper deals with the design and description of two developed tension con-
trollers for a continuous strip straightening section of the strip processing line. Two
special tension controllers were developed based on practical experiences. The ﬁrst
one is a tension controller with ramp, which is advisable to use for the control of
high tensions. The second controller is a stepper controller, which can be advan-
tageously used for the control of low tensions in a very long section. The controllers
were successfully applied during commissioning of a continuous levelling line for
aluminium strips and they work reliable. They consist of basic programming blocks
that are involved in the basic libraries of digital control systems.

Introduction to Linear Motors
Linear electric motors can drive a linear motion load without intermediate gears,
screws, or crank shafts [1]. Different linear motor topologies are presented in Fig. 1. In
practice, linear motion can be produced by four different ways. They are electrostatic,
electromagnetic, piezoelectric, and magnetostrictive. The electromagnetic-type linear
motors are again broadly classiﬁed into three groups: (i) DC motors (ii) induction
motors, and (iii) synchronous motors. The main difference between them is the
excitation approach. Figure 2 shows the classiﬁcation of linear motors [2].

Introduction to Linear Synchronous Reluctance Motors
Although linear synchronous reluctance motors (LSRELMs) are not commonly
spread in industrial applications, they are not utterly unfamiliar. The motor tech-
nology was dated back to 1975. Linear reluctance motor (LRM) having segmented
secondary has been studied in [3–6]. A semi-analytical theory for segmental-rotor
LRM having larger air gaps was developed and correlated with the experimental
results in [7]. Expressions for a goodness factor, efﬁciency, and power factor are
derived. LRM for urban transport vehicle application was designed and tested in
[8]. Figure 3 shows the equivalent circuit of the LRM.
A test rig was constructed in which the solid-steel rotor segments speeds of up to
5 m/s. The normal force of a toothed LRM had been analyzed using the permeance

function approach [9]. Figure 4 shows the two-phase toothed LRM. The advantage
of the toothed linear motor is that, no mechanical linkage is positioned between the
motor and the device. LRM with short secondary has been described in [10, 11].

Design Prospects of LSRELM
5.1
Basic design [17]
A three-phase, four-pole, two-layer LSRELM has been designed and optimized
using FEA. The secondary parameters such as teeth width and teeth height are
designed initially as 32.27 and 25.12 mm, respectively. Figure 10 shows the
ﬂowchart for thrust analysis using ﬁnite element analysis.

5.2
LSRELM with Multi-ﬂux Barrier [18, 19]
A reluctance equalization structure was designed in such a way that the reluctances
of all iron layers were equal with respect to the conventional equal-width structure.
5.2.1
Slotless Stator
The primary side is regarded as slotless, and the excitation current is treated as a
distributed current on the stator surface. It is evident from Fig. 11 that, forming a
reluctance equalization structure increases the thrust and is more effective under
operating conditions at which the iron layer will cause magnetic saturation.
5.2.2
Stator with Slots
Figure 12 shows the stator designed with slots. Three slot shapes are studied:
(i) open slots (ii) semi-closed slots, and (iii) fully closed slots. On the other hand,
two different mover slot shapes are considered: (i) angular and (ii) circular shapes.
Both the mover structures are shown in Fig. 13.
5.2.3
Double-Sided LSRELM [20–22]
The schematic model of LSRELM with double-sided stator is shown in Fig. 14. In
this conﬁguration, the thrust ripple ratio is 92% and the attractive force ripple ratio
is 21.5%.
To avoid these ripples, the mover was divided into a few segments as shown in
Fig. 15. The thrust ripple ratio of Type-B is 26.1% and Type-C is 19.0%. The
attractive force ripple ratio of Type-B is 5.8% and Type-C is 2.3%. These are
improved of the Type-A. The thrust of the Type-B is only decreased by 0.3%. As
the thrust of the Type-C is decreased by 17.1% from the Type-A, the Type-C mover
is unfavorable for carrier systems.

manent magnets, by applying three-dimensional boundary integral equation to a
short-primary motor (without magnet), are shown in Fig. 16. Six kinds of different
secondary geometries (refer Fig. 17) are calculated, and their characteristics are
discussed.
In addition, analyses are made on both single-sided and coreless permanent
magnet linear reluctance motor (PMLRM). The load angle characteristics for sec-
ondary iron plates of different conﬁgurations are analyzed.

employs rare-earth magnets with a thickness of 7 mm, a pitch of 24 mm, and a
width of 20 mm, and the is air-cored to avoid magnetic attraction. The load angle

Design of Optimal Secondary Segment Shapes Using Stochastic
Searching [28]
For the optimal design of secondary segment, stochastic search method was used to
change the shape of the secondary segments. In the initial shape of the segments,
two lamellas per primary slot pitch are considered (Fig. 19), which causes force
oscillations. The optimized shape obtained using FEM is depicted in Fig. 20. The
force oscillations occurring during the shift of the primary for one pole pitch were
analyzed.

LSRELM for Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System [29, 30]
LSRELM with the maximum-output thrust force and optimum power factor was
designed for electromagnetic aircraft launch system. In this model, a long primary
and a short secondary with a solid or laminated are evaluated. Figure 21 shows the
cross-sectional view of the designed motor.
The pole pitch was 150 mm for a 20-pole machine. Two type of winding
arrangement for stators in a blade system were considered; one N–N and another
N–S. The key results are shown in Figs. 22, 23, and 24, respectively. With the
Patterson model, the linear machine output force is not achievable. To overcome
this problem, a new machine conﬁguration was proposed with modiﬁed secondary
shown in Fig. 25. Results such as thrust force, ﬂux density variation, and harmonic
spectrum are shown in Figs. 26, 27, and 28, respectively, for model MM.

shape of the bulk is a rectangular parallelepiped. Figure 30 shows width depen-
dence of thrust and guidance forces on each length of the parameter. The larger the
thrust force increases, the thinner the thickness of the bulk. Figure 31 shows the
relation between HTS bulk volume and thrust force/HTS bulk volume (Fx/VHTS).

Control Aspects of LSRELM
6.1
Parameters Identiﬁcation in LSRELM [32, 33]
The experimental methods used for determining the aforementioned characteristics
are based on the closed-loop current control of the LSRELM supplied by a voltage
source inverter. The responded currents and the reference voltages, measured
during the experiment, are shown in Fig. 32.
Figure 33 shows the calculated ﬂux linkages, and their partial derivatives. The
trajectories of calculated thrust, Coulomb friction force, and ﬂux linkages are cal-
culated based on the control algorithms.

High-Performance Position Tracking [34–39]
Input–output linearizing control combined with the tracking controllers provides
good tracking performances and high disturbance rejection of a servo drive. The
translation range of the tested LSRELM is limited; therefore, the position, speed,
and acceleration trajectories are calculated from the kinematic model. The block
diagram of the input–output linearized system and its equivalent circuit is shown in
Fig. 34. Here, ‘M’ denotes the motor model. The system in Fig. 34 is linearized,
decoupled, and unstable. The simulated and experimental results are shown in
Figs. 35 and 36, respectively.

Transverse Flux LSRELM [40–46]
A static test machine, which has a transverse ﬂux coil arrangement and a thin
ferromagnetic reaction plate, has been manufactured and shown in Fig. 37. Two
types of rail systems are designed and implemented: (i) Segment-type reaction rail
and (ii) reluctance-type reaction rail.

6.4
Lateral Force in Segment-Type Reaction Rail
In this type of motor (refer Fig. 37 for reaction rail), the lateral force works to pull
back a primary member to the center of a reaction rail if a vehicle displaces in a
transverse direction. Figure 38 indicates the change of the lateral force for different
displacements as a parameter of load angle. When the load angle varies, the lateral
force decreases by 27, 36, and 26% for the air gap length of 1, 1.5, and 2 mm,
respectively.

Application and Future Scope
The applications of LSRELMs have been increased exponentially for the past one
decade. Some of the noted applications of LSRELMs are as follows:
1. High-speed trains
2. Elevators
3. High precision industrial servo drives
4. Electromagnetic aircraft launch system
5. Machining applications
6. Material handling systems, etc.
Although LSRELMs have many advantages, such as direct drive, more freedom
for structure design, and easy recycling, it suffers from poor power factor. Design of
magnetic structures with increased direct axis inductance, make use of advance
control aspects, and optimal converter conﬁguration are few possible solutions to
increase the power factor as well as performance of the machine, which the authors
consider as the future scope of this linear drive system.

Mitigation of Circulating Current in Diode
clamped MLI fed Induction Motor Drive
Using Carrier Shifting PWM Techniques
C. Bharatiraja, P. Sanjeevikumar, J.L. Munda, Lars Norum
and S. Raghu
Abstract Reduction in circulating current is one of the major considerations in
inverter-fed electrical drives. Diode-clamped MLI (DC-MLI) enables higher output
current per phase, thereby rating of the drive gets increased effectiveness. Various
methods of triggering in the inverter legs create a better voltage proﬁle and lead to
the enabling of circulating current in the drive system. The induced circulating
current (CC) ﬂows through the apparatus neutral (N), and supply ground (G) is
caused by the existence of parasitic capacitance. This circulating current may cause
potential danger, especially when parasitic capacitance poses large. In the past,
different modulation techniques and conversion topologies have been introduced to
minimize the ﬂow of circulating current. However, these techniques lead to com-
plexity, high cost, low voltage proﬁle, and efﬁciency due to lower modulation
parameters. This paper proposes PS, POD, PD carrier shifting PWM algorithms for
DC-MLI to tumbling the CC. The performances of the proposed algorithm, in terms

Introduction
Voltage source inverters (VSIs) are widely applied in different industrial needs for
conditioning the power in adjustable speed drives and renewable energy system
because of its ability to generate the desired output proﬁle [1, 2]. Multilevel
topologies are employed mainly to reduce the total harmonics distraction (THD) in
the inverter voltage and current output waveforms and to reach the required voltage
rating of the power switches and equipments. MLIs are eye-catching, more wide-
spread because of its power rating, reduced harmonics, and EMI. The multilevel
inverter contains three topologies, namely diode-clamped (DC-MLI), cascaded
inverters (H-bridge-MLI), and capacitor-clamped inverters (FC-MLI) [3, 4]. The
inverters have various types of modulation strategies to control the performance.
Space vector modulation (SVM) is one of the most popular PWM techniques. The
carrier-based PWM strategy can be segregated into two types: single carrier and
multicarrier PWM. The diode-clamped multilevel inverters are having some good
advance features such as stair case waveform and minimized harmonics, and it is
having an advantage of controlling the medium voltage drives [5]. In DC-MLIs,
modulation schemes like, phase disposition (PD), phase opposition disposition
(POD), alternative phase opposition disposition (APOD), PS (phase shift) gives
best results in terms of constant carrier frequency not synchronized with the stator
terminal frequency [6, 7]. For diode-clamped inverters, POD modulation strategy is
widely used, however it offers a high harmonic performance [8]. Out of the
modulation strategies, the space vector PWM gives a greater fundamental output
voltage and improved harmonic performance of the inverter. The analysis of cir-
culating current is more important in the AC motor drives application. It produces
between neutral point (N) of the motor and supply ground (G). The existence of
shaft voltage, bearing damage, etc., is some of the major effect of circulating
current. The concurrent switching of the series connected switches creates high
dv/dt across the load terminals of the inverter. The increase in circulating current
affects the motor insulation and also the cables. In drive applications, it may cause
the electromagnetic interference (EMI), and this noise causes to trip the inverter
drive [9]. It is very essential to limit the CC to certain boundary. A MLI can reduce
the CC. The output voltage of multilevel inverter will vary in small increments
because of the number of switching states [10], and it allows to mitigate the
low-frequency harmonics, thereby the switching loss will be reduced. Furthermore,
the CC can be reduced by reducing the dv/dt [11]. The cascaded inverter is widely
implemented in the industrial applications in the literature [12, 13]; however, the
main drawback of this type of conﬁguration is it requires isolation transformers on
72

the AC side and a number of DC sources. Among all the conﬁgurations present in
multilevel inverter, the analysis of circulating current is derived from the DC-MLI,
which is the more frequent topology of the three-level inverters. For medium- and
high-voltage AC drives, this topology can be connected directly to the power
system utility.
The effect of shaft voltage and its resulting current was studied by Alger in the
1920s [14]. Various mechanical modiﬁcations in the system had been presented in
the literature to eliminate the negative effects of the circulating current over motor
bearing, such as cable type, passive ﬁlters, and the type of the bearing. There are
two types of cables available: shielded type and unshielded type; the unshielded
type of cable has no impact on the circulating currents, and the shielded type of
cable has no impact on small rating motors and on higher rated motors; the mag-
nitude of CC is inversely relative to the motor speed. Pairodamonchai [15] has
given the procedure for designing and complications while designing passive ﬁlters.
There are four types of ﬁlters available to mitigate the CC: dv/dt ﬁlters, reactors
[16], sinusoidal ﬁlters [17], and common-mode (CM) chokes [18]. The elimination
of bearing current is 30–90% [16, 19] based on the type of the ﬁlter on large rating
motors, and there is no impact [20] in small rating motors. Moreover, the passive
ﬁlters have more size and weight penalties. There are two types of bearings
available: insulated bearing [21, 22] and hybrid bearing. Insulated bearing elimi-
nates 40–60% of the circulating current on small rating motors and 60–80% [23] on
large rating motors. Hybrid bearings give complete suppression of bearing currents
in small motors not suitable for the large motor applications [24], [25], [26].
The different PWM technique provides different values of circulating current in
the inverter. In this paper, the circulating current suppression is proposed with the
different modulation strategies. A three-level DC-MLI is designed to drive 400-V,
three-phase induction motor. Sinusoidal PWM, PD, POD, PS techniques are
implemented using a MATLAB-2013b for the modulating index, ma = 0.9 and
switching frequency of 1050 Hz. The partial elimination of circulating current
implemented using SPARTEN III family FPGA processor. The simulation and
experimental results are provided to validate the CC in three-level DC-MLI.

Effect of High Circulating Currents
The circulating current can be deﬁned as the current that exists between the
application neutral and ground.

The motor shaft voltage on the rotor side is induced due to the common mode

where BVR is the bearing voltage ratio.
This circulating current causes the malfunctioning of the sensitive electronic
equipment such as in control systems, false tripping of the ground fault relays. In
rotating electrical machines, this current damages the bearing which in turn dam-
ages the machine and also causes electromagnetic interference. The instantaneous
current sum is called as the circulating current. The generation of circulating current
can be observed from Fig. 1.

Carrier Shifting Algorithms
To generate the required PWM signal on the carrier-based pulse width modulation,
the triangular carrier wave is compared with the reference sine wave.
A. Single carrier pulse width modulation (PWM)
The SPWM is one of the top modulation methods in the control of VSI. In SPWM,
single triangular carrier wave is related to the single sine wave reference in order to
generate ﬁring signals for switching of the power electronic switches. In the
medium-voltage applications, power dissipation is one of the most common
problems. The open-loop SPWM control method of fundamental frequency is to
minimize the switching losses.
B. Multicarrier PWM
The multicarrier PWM (MC-PWM) technique is employed only for the MLIs. This
practice is used to increase the efﬁciency of the inverter output. In this PWM
technique, the carrier waves are in two ways: horizontal and vertical. The vertical
carrier distribution techniques are classiﬁed into two conﬁgurations: PD and POD,
where the horizontal distribution arrangement is only one type and that is PS control
technique.
C. Phase disposition (PD)
The phase disposition is one of the techniques in the MC-PWM. In this type of
technique, the number of carriers depends upon the number of levels in the VSI.
The formula for knowing the number of carriers is (m −1). Here, m is number of
levels. All carriers should be in phase disposition (PD, the PD-PWM is best suited
for the NPC). We can observe this technique from Fig. 2.
D. Phase opposition disposition (POD)
The number of carriers is (m −1), and all these carriers are in phase with zero
reference. Here, the carriers are arranged above the zero reference and below the
Fig. 2 Phase disposition
(PD) PWM technique

75

zero reference in phase and phase opposition, respectively. Fig. 3 represents the
POD technique.
E. Phase shift (PS) PWM
The number of carriers is (m −1), and each carrier is shifted by an angle of 90°
accordingly. Figure 4 represents the phase shift technique.

Analysis of Circulating Current Depends on Switching
States
The circulating currents have been discussed for the different switching states
available in the below sections. The circulating current can be stated as the current
between the applied N and the G points of the inverter. Magnitude of circulating
current depends on the amount of the inverter input current. In the balanced
star-connected load, the sum of phase currents is zero. The three-level NPC inverter
produces different combinations of the phase current depends on the switching

Circulating Current Reduction
The circulating current minimization can be done by avoiding the abnormal
switching of the inverter. The PWM techniques such as PD, POD, and PS can
control the circulating current to such an extent, though the controlling of switching
operation is not possible. The above chapter gives the detailed analysis of the
available switching states and corresponding circulating current. From that analysis,
selecting the proper switching states the circulating current can be minimized. In the
partial reduction of circulating current can be eliminated up to Idc/3(n −1) for
n-level inverter. In the partial elimination, the three-level inverter allows the cir-
culating current magnitude of ±Idc/6. Harmonics are inversely proportional to the
common mode voltage. This shows that the reduction in harmonics can be achieved
by eliminating the common mode voltage. Similarly, the circulating current is
directly proportional to the harmonics. The amount of harmonics will decrease with
the reduction in the circulating current. Different PWM techniques such as PS, PD,
and POD will reduce the circulating current to such an extent. The PS PWM
technique eliminates only till the level of ±Idc/2. The PD technique will reduce the
circulating current till ±Idc/6.
The necessity to reduce the CC is more with the aim of protecting the device
from the failures. Finally, the POD algorithm will reduce the circulating current till
±Idc/3. By comparing all the above results, the best algorithm to reduce the CC is
PD algorithm type. As we know already, the circulating current is directly pro-
portional to the harmonics. So the harmonic level in the PD technique is compar-
atively low compared to all different algorithms.

the PD technique provides good results in terms of the circulating current and
harmonics. This is the partial elimination technique of the circulating current. The
complete elimination is not possible while using POD. The simulation, provided in

Experimental Results
In this section, theoretical and simulation results for a 1 kW load system are shown.
All waveforms shown in this section are captured from FPGA SPARTAN-III-
3AN-XC3S400. The simulated MATLAB code connected with the FPGA board
through system generated tool ensures the less computational complexity environ-
ment [28, 29]. Three-phase three-level IGBT-based NPC MLI was used for to
experimentation of the proposed PD PWM. The Fig. 7 shows the experimental results
of PD PWM. Where in Fig. 7a shows the output voltage, Fig. 7b shows the pulse
generation, and Fig. 7c shows the circulating current. The following waveforms
represent the voltage output, pulse generation and circulating current, respectively.
The IGBT used here is IRG4BC20FD with a fundamental frequency of 50 Hz and
switching frequency of 1 kHz. The input DC bus voltage is 150 V. 1 kW motor with
50 mH inductance and 15 nF capacitance is used here. The circulating current miti-
gated using the PD technique is ±Idc/6 and that can be observed from the following
diagram, and the performance of the system is improved in terms of harmonics
(Table 1).

Conclusions
Premature failure of the bearings in the conventional two-level inverter is due to the
induced circulating current in it. MLIs have their intrinsic ability to lessen the
circulating current. Simulation and experimental results prove that the magnitude of
the circulating current minimized to ±Idc/6, and that has a minimum THD in the line
voltage and current. The proposed three different PWM techniques will also decrease
the cost of reduction. Thus, when compared to the two-level inverter, the multilevel
inverters have lots of advantages in terms of leakage current and harmonics.

Three-Level Inverter with C-Type Filter

Simulink/MATLAB
Manjesh and B. Rajesh
Abstract The inverters and converters are introducing harmonics due to its
properties. The most commonly used load for a three-phase line is a motor for
industrial applications. The major problem of linear and nonlinear loads like motors
are heats up due to harmonics introduced in the line voltage. The analysis of total
harmonic distortion and magnitude of harmonics at the output of the three-phase
inverter drive is carried out in this work. The simulation is obtained using
MATLAB/Simulink. A traditional three-level inverter and three-level inverter with
C-type ﬁlter are constructed and simulated. The circuits are built using IGBTs as
switches and pulse generators are used to provide the gating signal to the switches.
A three-phase asynchronous machine is provided with the same parameter of actual
motor. An FFT analysis is done to obtain magnitudes of harmonics at the inverter
output voltage, and the obtained results are compared.

Introduction
Many researchers have done their studies on intelligent power modules to construct
inverter and converters for high-power electronic system. Different methods are
used to control various electric machines, and most of these machines are nonlinear
loads. The voltage and current harmonics produced by these nonlinear loads causes
damage to the power grid, and quality of the power supplied by the grid is reduced.
The important parameter in power quality is the power system harmonics‚ the most

conventional method of reducing these harmonics is to use ﬁlters and multilevel
inverters. The power electronic system has their own limits on the magnitude of
voltage and/or current harmonics in electrical machine. The variable speed appli-
cations in industries are induction motors and synchronous motors, and the
pulse-width modulation (PWM) inverters are used to achieve motor’s speed vari-
ation. The various techniques of PWM inverters are used to drive the induction
motor. To control the speed of the induction motor, a voltage/frequency method is
employed, and the major drawback of the inverter is it produces odd harmonics [1–
4]. Percentage of total harmonic distortion is obtained using FFT analysis, and in
this work a three-level inverter is used to vary the speed of induction motor. For
high-power applications in industry a three-level inverter is widely used, and the
inverter constructed with multilevels synthesizes the output voltage approximately
sinusoidal than the normal two-level inverter. The three-level inverter approxi-
mately improves magnitude of harmonics four times the normal inverter drive.
Many researchers use the PWM multilevel inverters to minimize the harmonics, and
in addition to multilevel inverters, ﬁlters can also be used to eliminate the har-
monics completely at the output of the inverter. There are many types of ﬁlters for
PWM inverter drives to limit the harmonics. The output of multilevel inverter
provides an output voltage with more and more sinusoidal. The PWM inverter
output is added with additional odd harmonics such as 5th, 7th, 11th, 13th. The ﬁfth
harmonic magnitude is equal to 20% of the nonlinear load current, and similarly
seventh harmonic is 14.30%. The suppression of inverter output harmonics is an
added advantage, and the nominal power (P1) is given by Eq. 1 where P1 is nominal
power, V1 is line-to-line voltage across load, and R is the resistance of the load. The
elements used in this experimental work are a resistor and an inductor. The reac-
tance X1 is calculated using Eq. 2. The reactive power (Q1) is given by Eq. 3,
where V is line-to-line voltage across load [4–9].

Traditional or Two-Level Inverter (TID)
The traditional or two-level inverter circuit has six IGBTs. Figure 1 depicts the
circuit diagram of a three-phase two-level inverter. Three phases in the inverter are
120° out of phase with each other, and pulse generators are used to provide the
gating signal to the switches. The switch Sb1 is turned on with a phase shift of 120°,
and the switch Sa1 and switch Sc1 will be turned on for the next phase shift of 120°
with respect to Sb1. All the IGBTs used in the circuit can be divided into upper and

lower IGBTs. The IGBT’s Sa1, Sb1, and Sc1 are +ve group of switches, and also Sa2,
Sb2, and Sc2 are −ve group switches. The −ve group switches—Sa2, Sb2, and Sc2 are
compliment signals with respect to their upper switches—Sa1, Sb1, and Sc1. Both
+ve and −ve group switches in the same leg should never turned on together. The
pattern in which the switches are turned on can be analyzed, if two switches from
+ve group are ON, and one switch from −ve group is ON or two switches from −ve
group are ON, and one switch from +ve group is ON. The combination of these
control signals produce a three-phase output voltage which is connected to drive the
three-phase induction motor.

Diode-Clamped Multilevel Inverter (DCMI)
The three-level PWM inverter is constructed with 12 IGBTs. Figure 2 shows the
construction of three-level inverter. Control signals are generated by pulse gener-
ators. All the three-phase signals have 120° phase shift with each other. The IGBT5
is switched on for a phase shift of 120° with reference to IGBT1, and also IGBT9
will be turned on with a phase shift of 120° with reference to IGBT5. The IGBT2,
IGBT6, and IGBT10 are switched on with a phase shift of 10° with respect to
IGBT1, IGBT5, and IGBT9 are ON for the period of 160°. IGBT1, IGBT2 IGBT5,
IGBT6, IGBT9, and IGBT10 are the +group switches, and IGBT3, IGBT4 IGBT7,
IGBT8, IGBT11, and IGBT12 are the −ve group switches. The −ve group switches
are the compliments of +ve group switches. IGBT3, IGBT4 IGBT7, IGBT8, IGBT11,
and IGBT12 are the compliments of IGBT1, IGBT2 IGBT5, IGBT6, IGBT9, and
IGBT10, respectively.

traditional inverter output and three-level DCMI inverter drive, and the work is
extended for construction of three-level DCMI with C-type ﬁlter. The induction
machine is run with a frequency of 8 Hz. The circuits have been simulated in
MATLAB/Simulink, in this work the harmonic analysis and THD are studied, and
the results are obtained after repetitive trials with variable elements. The output
voltage of traditional inverter, DCMI, and DCMI with ﬁlter is obtained and pre-
sented in Figs. 4, 5, and 6. The harmonic graph of line-to-ground voltage for
traditional inverter drive (TID) and DCMI is presented in Fig. 7. Figure 8 shows

Conclusion
The traditional inverter, three-level diode-clamped multilevel inverter, and DCMI
with ﬁlter have been constructed using MATLAB/Simulink. A C-type ﬁlter is
connected at the output of inverter to study the effects of harmonics; the results
obtained with and without C-type ﬁlter have been simulated and compared. The
analysis shows that the inverter output is nearly sinusoidal output; the individual
harmonics at the PWM inverter are also reduced. The total harmonic distortion is
also found to be less. It is concluded that using C-type ﬁlter at the output of the
inverter has made signiﬁcant improvements to the harmonic suppression. The
results can be extended to carry out temperature analysis of three-phase asyn-
chronous motor in future.

Abstract When radio frequency micro-electromechanical switch is closed posi-
tion, it provides very small insertion loss, and in opened position, it provides
superior isolation. RF MEMS switch is presented for low actuation voltage and
stress computation. The ﬂexures and multiple perforation is used to reduce actua-
tion voltages due to this the spring constant is also reduces. The stress is calculated
by simulating slender micro-membrane which is made up of hafnium oxide
material. The RF MEMS switch is designed with supporting of various types of
ﬂexures which provides different displacement and capacitance. The RF MEMS
switch is designed Fixed Fixed beam with supported of various types of meanders

Introduction
From last few years the Radio frequency Micro-electromechanical system (MEMS)
based devices or switches have created more revolution in industry or in Electronics
markets [1]. RF MEMS switch is fabricated with semiconductor technology for
communication application due to their small size and good performance [2]. Pin
diode requires a power to operate at high frequency. RF micro-electromechanical
switch consumes low power for operation [2]. MEMS switch has drawback of high
pull in voltage against the current which is useless in micro-system. The drawback
is removing by using electrostatic mechanism which is to control the pull in voltage
of switch. To reduce the pull in voltage, the researchers employed reducing the
stiffness constant by increasing the length or decreasing the width of switch,
reducing the air gap between electrodes and increasing the actuation area [3].

The stiffness constant concept is depend on spring constant of beam. As decreasing
in spring constant of beam with increasing the length of beam or reducing the width
of beam but it should be ensures that beam have doesn’t any stiction with surface.
As stiction problems created, the losses of restoring force increases due to this it
could not decrement in pull in voltage [3]. MEMS switches are classiﬁed in two
parts: capacitive and direct. Direct contact Microelectronic mechanical switch is
generally used for gigahertz operated application while for high frequency appli-
cation used capacitive switches. MEMS switch has two stable states, ON state and
OFF state, which is applied through mechanism of electrostatic, magentostatic, or
thermally induced forces. Radio frequency micro-electromechanical system switch
is widely used for electrostatic actuation due to little insertion loss, small power
consumption, highly reliable for higher frequency, and short switching time.
Electrostatic MEMS switches entail an excessive actuation voltage to operate the
movable component. In the wireless communication application, RF MEMS switch
requires low pull in voltage [4].

Material
The material plays a vital role in RF MEMS switch. The material which has a
higher constant is being considered with a thin layer providing same performance.
Hafnium oxide dielectric materials have been latterly focused for their reliable
performance. As some dielectric materials contain very low crystallizing tempera-
ture, it is very major task to integrate them into CMOS. The hafnium oxide dielectric
material has advantages over other dielectric material as it has good insulation and
capacitance interpretation. It prevents diffusion of dopants such as boron and
phosphorus and protects from breakdown performance. It also has good thermal
stability, sound interface, and high recrystallization temperature qualities [5].

The electrostatic actuation technique is a popular technique for capacitive switch.
The actuation process is also achieved by thermal, magnetic, and piezoelectric
techniques. In electrostatic actuation method, a DC voltage is given between the
two electrodes or bridge and the base of electrode. The square of electric ﬁeld E is
proportional to the downward force of beam. The spring force is proportional to the
deﬂection of the beam due to which beam will be moved towards ground electrode.
The applied voltage is given by Vin, gap between two electrodes is given by g, and
area is deﬁned by A. The spring constant of the beam depends on geometry
dimension of the beam. The beam spring constant will be varying with change in
Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and material. The variation in geometrical of
beam changed the pull down voltage and also changed displacement between

ground and electrode. As applied voltage is apply on beam due to this downward
force on beam is increases fastly in the compare of upward force and beam found to
deﬂect [6]. The high electrostatic actuation voltages give conﬂicting effect on
reliability of switch. As the electric ﬁeld changes, it will change the gap and
actuation voltage E [6].

Surface Contact Analysis
RF MEMS shunt switch executes vital role in examination of surface contact. The
radio frequency signal ﬂow through a pathway lies between opened transmission
lines and switch beam. The system loss and insertion loss on the transmission line
path will be determined during the process. When electrostatic actuation voltage is
applied to electrodes, the beam changes its position and its move downward in
z-direction. In Fixed-Fixed beam the middle tip will be touch the ground electrode
due to this the RF signal transmit through the switch [7].
5
Stress Analysis
In multiphysics, software computes the von Mises stress of the ﬁxed-ﬁxed beam
membrane at ﬁxed height [8]. The hafnium oxide material is introduced in mem-
brane which provides maximum stress of 20.84 MPa for Switch A and 45.55 MPa
for Switch B. The two switches are designed with different ﬂexures of support It
provides distinct stress analysis. The switch B is provides maximum stress so it has
good quality to hold higher switching with maximum stress.
6
Flexures
In this research aim design the RF MEMS switch with reduced spring constant
value and minimized actuation voltage. The ﬂexures or meanders are added in the
beam to provide supported beam [9]. These ﬂexures pull down the value of spring
constant [9]. As more ﬂexures are added, it signiﬁcantly reduced the spring constant
without extremely increasing the required space. As smallness is essential for a
device to be ﬁxed in RF MEMS application, Eqs. 1 and 2 are as follows

Geometry and Simulation of RF MEMS Shunt Switch
The sacriﬁcial layer is removed by adding perforation beam plates during the
fabrication process. The perforated beam or switch advance changes in capacitance
ratio of switch and switching time [10]. The shunt RF MEMS switch is a switch in
which both ends are ﬁxed at both sides above free gap. The dielectric material HfO2
with high dielectric constant value and good thermal stability is used in RF MEMS
switch. The beam is supported at both ends with ﬂexures or meanders which
provides greater ﬂexibility. Here, two types of meanders are connected to the beam,
and due to this, it provides various properties of switch. The design and simulation
of RF MEMS switch done bys using Comsol multiphysics software. The software
calculated the pull in voltage, capacitance and stress. As in Fig. 1, Switch A and
Switch B simulated are shown which represent the maximum displacement in
z-direction at pull in voltage. Both switches also compute stress due electrostatic
force.
8
Result and Discussion
The amount of rectangular perforation is used in RF MEMS switch which is
approximately same in both switches. Figure 1 shows the simulation Switch A
22.1 V at the maximum displacement −0.308 lm. The Switch B provides maxi-
mum displacement −0.418 lm at 22.1 V. The concept of switches is designed for
low power consumption and reduces squeeze ﬁlm damping, residual stress, and
high switching speed. The fringing ﬁelds and air resistance of switch can be
reduced by adding perforation. The graph is between applied voltage and dis-
placement for Switch A and Switch B for various voltages. As air gaps reduce, the
value of down capacitance continuously increases. The Switch A capacitance is
26.8 fF, and Switch B capacitance is 27.6 fF.

Conclusion
As result conclude structure of ﬂexures reduced the pull in voltaage and provide
maximum displacement. If switch required low actuation voltage and high
switching speed, then the Switch B is used for better reliability. The hafnium oxide
material with high dielectric constant value provides high switching speed and
lower mass and reduces squeeze ﬁlm damping at low actuation voltage. The
capacitance of Switch B provides greater displacement compared to Switch A.

Optimal Design Conﬁguration Using
HOMER
Prashant Kumar and Sanjay Deokar
Abstract The aim of this chapter was to present an idea of using free sources of
energy for designing stand-alone hybrid renewable energy system. This stand-alone
hybrid system is used for powering the Electrical Engineering Department of
AMGOI, located at latitude and longitude 16.8347 and 74.3148, respectively, of
Peth Vadgaon Kolhapur, Maharashtra. The target of designing this system is to ﬁnd
the optimal net present cost (NPC), cost of energy, emissions, and monthly elec-
tricity production. The motive of this paper is to give optimal solution to the
problems of energy crisis in the globe. In current scenario, the non-renewable
sources are available in plenty amount to fulﬁll our increasing demand. Considering
the above information, we have made an effort to analyze advantage of distributed
generation. If we use only solar power or wind power, it can ﬂuctuate and is not a
reliable source of energy. The combination of solar and wind energy sources with
diesel generator provides a reliable generation and a constant source of energy ﬂow
for the designed system. The main task of this research work is to analyze the
possibility of solar–wind–diesel hybrid power system by maximizing the use of
non-conventional generation system while minimizing the total system cost.

Introduction
In recent era, there is a great scope for advancement in power generation consid-
ering environment-friendly technology such as renewable energy technology which
is technically viable and environment friendly. All over the world, effort is being
made to study the feasibility of renewable energy incorporated within hybrid sys-
tem which will prove to be the best alternative of diesel generator. In village, hybrid

energy system offers an attractive and practical solution to meet electrical power
demand in rural communities around the globe [1–3].
Main drawbacks of the stand-alone system are irregular delivery of power due to
ﬂuctuations of energy as provided by free source of energy. This can be a bottle-
neck in different areas, such as agriculture and factory, where reliable and con-
tinuous supply are required. Such types of problems can be solved by using
stand-alone hybrid systems. A hybrid power system usually consists of more than
two energy sources to increase the efﬁciency and reliability. In comparison with
conventional sources, hybrid system uses the better features of individual energy
resource. The electricity generated by hybrid system has quality as par with con-
ventional ones, with a wide power range.
The major advantage of a hybrid system is that it is continuous and reliable. At
any time of the day, one of the power sources will be usually at higher level, even if
other is running at lower level. Solar panel is less effective on cloudy and windy days
so it will produce lower energy levels, while wind generator may be producing a lot
of energy. Similarly, for wind generation, the main issue is location of the site, where
the ﬂow of wind is irregular. The major use of non-conventional energy is that the
long-term energy prices are reduced, and diesel generator combination is used as
backup in emergency such as high loads or low renewable power availability.
This case study is done on the Electrical Engineering Department of AMGOI,
Kolhapur, one of the remote areas where grid connectivity/extension is difﬁcult; in
our case study, Vathar and Kolhapur areas are considered whose latitude is
17° 53′ 0″ North and longitude is 74° 9′ 0″ East (Fig. 1).
1.1
Advantages of Distributed Generation
The basic tangible beneﬁts of distributed generation are as follows:
• Using prefabricated standardized components helps in easy and faster installation.
• For long distance, high-voltage transmission is economical.

• Eco-friendly means reduction in emission using non-conventional energy
sources.
• Using non-conventional sources, the running cost remains constant over a
period of time.
• Less complexity encourages possibility of user-operator participation.
1.2
HOMER Software
HOMER is the acronym for Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable. It is
the most widely used software and developed in 1993 [1]. HOMER does both opti-
mization and sensitivity analysis. With the help of HOMER, system performs the
energy balance calculation considering several numbers and sizes of component.
A sorted list of conﬁguration result based on the total net present cost (TNPC) has been
displayed on the software. Sensitivity analysis determines varying factors such as wind
speed and fuel cost. HOMER displays simulation results in a tabular and graphical
form on the basis of possible conﬁgurations. These results assist in comparison with
different conﬁgurations and evaluation based on their economic merits [3–5].
2
Methodology
In this paper, the proposed simulated hybrid renewable energy system consists of
wind turbine, photovoltaic (PV) array with power converter, battery, and diesel
generator. In case of an emergency, battery is used as a backup unit for the con-
sidered system that acts as a storage medium. The considered system is designed
speciﬁcally for an off-grid continuous power supply (24/7) to ATM machine. The
data required for solar and wind resources for the automatic teller machine site were
taken from online data of NASAs Meteorological department. The survey has been
made to plot a graph between daily load proﬁle and energy consumption of ATM.
Simulations, optimization, and sensitivity analysis are the key tasks of HOMER
software that plays an important role in determination of optimized solution [6].
These main tasks of the HOMER software are discussed below.
2.1
HOMER: Simulation
The proposed system is designed on the basis of the selection of components by
design engineer. Here, the considered components are PV array, wind turbine,
diesel generator with battery, and converter for the purpose of analysis [4, 5]. After
simulation, it determines the best optimal system conﬁguration which is suitable to

provide the energy demand. HOMER will simulate the designed system based on
the estimation of NPC [3, 4].
2.2
HOMER: Optimization
The best optimal possible system conﬁguration has been obtained by performing search
operation after simulation process. A list of conﬁguration result displayed in a sorted
form considers total net present cost (TNPC). HOMER analyzes the different possible
conﬁgurations of system according to TNPC. However, the sensitivity variable selected
by the designer can impact the system conﬁguration which is based on TNPC.
2.3
HOMER: Sensitivity Analysis
For a sensitive analysis, software shows that how the outputs of the problem is
related with inputs. The HOMER software will perform the iterations to get optimal
result for each. Various system conﬁgurations of designed hybrid renewable energy
will be presented in a tabular form considering cost-wise analysis in an ascending
order of TNPC. The designed energy system having lowest TNPC will be con-
sidered as an optimal solution [2, 4, 5].

Conclusion
In this work, we designed four hybrid systems: solar–wind, solar–diesel, wind–
diesel, and solar–wind–diesel. According to the NPC, ranks are given to all opti-
mization systems used in the case study. Economic values are calculated for the
purpose of electrifying Electrical Engineering Department of AMGOI and ﬁnding
the optimal net present cost (NPC), cost of energy, emissions, and monthly elec-
tricity production. Based on these values and comparisons, the optimal system is
solar–wind power system. The cost of energy and the net present cost of the solar–
wind hybrid system are lesser than other systems because operating and

Designing of a Half-Bridge Converter
for Lead-Acid Battery Charger
Jitendra Singh Tamang, Rachit Saxena, Snigdha Kalita
and Akash Kumar Bhoi
Abstract In our daily life, power electronic circuits such as inverters, UPS, and
SMPS comprise of AC–DC converters and DC–DC converters are widely used.
The chapter, however, makes an effort to present a charging circuit comprising of
transistors, control circuit, and rectiﬁers for a discharged battery to make it
chargeable which can be used in electric vehicle and mobile applications. In this
chapter, we have tried designing a converter using different softwares viz OrCAD,
MATLAB, and PROTEUS and tried calculating the different parameters related to
each design. Further based on the obtained results, we have done the hardware
implementation of the converter. Almost all the designing methods encourage the
implementation of different types of SMPS converters because of higher efﬁciency
and greater transformer utilization factor (TUF). Among these converters,
half-bridge and full-bridge converters have enormous and important role in the ﬁeld
of power electronics and industry application. The converters can be designed and
implemented in different ways depending on the area of application.

Introduction
The converters always play a vital role especially in the ﬁeld of industry and
automation. However, only few converters make their signiﬁcance known based on
their different factors like form factors, ripple factors, power conversion efﬁciency [1,
2]. The major part of electronic and automation applications are its batteries and ﬁlter
circuits. Therefore, the rectifying and charging circuit for a particular electronic
device is very essential for any electrical and electronic system. For charging purposes
in the area of power electronics, isolated DC–DC converters [3, 4] are used. The DC–
DC converters or DC–AC converters or AC–DC converters are chosen in such a way
that their conversion percentage makes them more efﬁcient to use for different
technology.
The different types of converters mainly are a kind of SMPS. Starting from
half-bridge converters [2, 5] to push–pull converters and then to full-bridge con-
verters, each has its own power consumption and efﬁciency. However, among them
half-bridge converter topology is extremely used in power electronics and basic
electronic applications. The converter is capable enough to provide an output power
utilization of more than 450 W.
In recent times, apart from designing a simple half-bridge converter, a particular
concept of switching characteristics of a transistor is also taken into consideration.
More emphasis is given on their designing and electrical properties rather than
implementing them in charging and rectifying circuits. Apart from ampliﬁcation,
switching purpose is also being highlighted if one designs a converter. The only
possibility is switching characteristics of a power semiconductor device can be
controlled and thus maintaining a proper efﬁciency. Though the charging circuit
proposed by us follows constant current principle, the another method of charging a
discharged battery is by using a bidirectional converter [6, 7]. The main objective of
the project is to study the purpose of isolated DC–DC converters and design and
implement a battery charging circuit using different formulae [1].
2
Methods
2.1
Proposed Block Diagram
Before going into the methods of how we have tried designing and making a
prototype of the battery charger, at ﬁrst we should know why the half-bridge
converters are preferred among other converters viz ﬂyback, forward, and
full-bridge converters. The reasons behind choosing such converter are as follows:
1. The circuits of half-bridge converters are simpler.
2. It is more cost-effective (low cost).
3. Due to the presence of capacitors, the output in the on time of the transistors
increases efﬁciency to 90% range.
110
J.S. Tamang et al.

4. Physical size of the circuit is small.
5. Power density is more.
6. Square wave frequency is twice that of other converters (e.g., forward
converters).
7. For low- and medium-power applications, half-bridge converters provide a
better solution than full-bridge converters which are generally used for
high-power applications ranging from several hundred to thousand kilowatts
(kWs).
The simplest block diagram for the proposed half-bridge converter is given in
Fig. 1.
2.2
Simulation of the Proposed Block Diagram Using
Different Software Tools
The designing and calculation of different parameters of the half-bridge converter
was being done using software tools like OrCAD, PROTEUS, and MATLAB. The
proposed block diagram was being tested using PROTEUS software tool as given
in Fig. 2.

Calculation of Different Parameters Using Different
Software Tools
Based on the software tools used viz OrCAD, PROTEUS, MATLAB and taking the
help of the proposed block diagram, the parameters like time period (T), on-time
period (tON), no. of turns in the primary (NP), secondary side (NS), and resonant
frequency (fr) are being calculated, and a comparison is being drawn among all the
calculated parameters [1].

Table 1 shows the comparison of the above-mentioned parameters being cal-
culated using different software tools.
From the values of the above table, we can notice that each and every parameter
values play a signiﬁcant role for designing a half-bridge converter. The OrCAD
software has a very less time period and less no. of turns required in the primary
side and secondary side of the transformer but has more resonant frequency than the
one calculated in the PROTEUS software tool. The maximum resonant frequency
which we calculated is in MATLAB software tool, but the drawback lies in the less
time period and on-time period as compared with the other software tools.
Therefore, we can notice that for different software tools, we get different para-
metric values which will be helpful enough for us to design different kinds of
half-bridge converters. Based on the calculated values and taking the help of the
proposed block diagram, we were being able to have a hardware implementation of
the half-bridge DC–DC converter which can be used as a lead-acid battery charger.

Conclusion
The closed loop hardware implementation and simulation using various software of
the half-bridge converter with calculations and different ratings was done. The
development of a converter for charging a discharged battery taking the concept of
half-bridge converter with several parameters was completed. The assistance of a
discharged battery was taken wherein it was being charged to around 15 V to
understand the importance of half-bridge converter. Also, apart from charging a
discharged battery, the half-bridge converter also has a rectiﬁer circuit to minimize
and remove any ripples present after conversion. This feature makes it idle to be
utilized in automation and electronic ﬁelds.
Throughout the implementation of the converter, we gained the knowledge of
how different simulating software tools help us to get the desired values.
Henceforth, the proposed block was implemented in PROTEUS and expected
outputs were obtained, and later the same was modiﬁed to achieve desired results
for the hardware implementation. Apart from UPS, the SMPS also operates like
half-bridge converters and full-bridge converters. Hard switching SMPS also ﬁnds
its role in the power switches in order to have higher power efﬁciency. To achieve
high-efﬁciency circuit conﬁguration, zero voltage switching (ZVS) and zero current
switching (ZCS) are being implemented making the half-bridge converter just as an
alternative option. Therefore, to achieve higher power output, one concentrates
mainly on full-bridge converters as it is used for high-power applications ranging
from several hundred to thousand kWs even though it is complex and not
user-friendly.

A Comparative Analysis of Determination
of Design Parameters of Boost
and Buck–Boost Converters Using
Artiﬁcial Intelligence
Ipsita Das and Moumi Pandit
Abstract Conventionally, mathematical calculations based on formulas are
required to model and design any converter for software or hardware implemen-
tation. However, in this chapter, an alternative method has been suggested to
replace the conventional method of formula-based mathematical calculations by
developing a hybrid model known as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system
(ANFIS). It is a hybrid system which combines two most important methodologies
of soft computation namely artiﬁcial neural network and fuzzy logic. It has been
used as the tool in MATLAB platform to determine the design parameters of Boost
and Buck–Boost converters. The alternative suggested in this chapter also focuses
on reduction of computational time and susceptibility toward human error in
mathematical calculation.

Introduction
To understand and analyze any system, proper designing and modeling is very
important. Modeling and designing also helps to anticipate the behavior and nature
of the system in the future. Various soft computing methods based on artiﬁcial
intelligence have emerged as effective tool to simplify the process of modeling and
designing of complex systems. One such efﬁcient hybrid method which integrates
neural network and fuzzy logic is ANFIS. Fuzzy logic helps to deal with uncer-
tainties and imprecision with the help of linguistic variables which are the fuzzy
if-then rules while neural network presents the ability of learning capability and self

adaptability. A Takagi–Sugeno-type ANFIS model has been considered in this
chapter. The ANFIS model is an adaptive network consisting of nodes which are
interlinked with each other. Parameters are associated with each node, and they
change in accordance with the membership function associated with them
throughout the learning process. Various artiﬁcial models have been developed
using soft computation techniques to implement them as controllers in various
converters [1, 2], but in this proposed work, these artiﬁcial models have been
successfully implemented for designing converters. With the increase in demand of
regulated power supply, DC–DC power converters have emerged as an important
trend in power electronics. Boost and Buck–Boost converters have been considered
for modeling and designing in this chapter. Both the converters convert unregulated
DC input voltage to regulated output DC voltage. Boost converter produces reg-
ulated output voltage which is greater than the input voltage [3, 4], whereas the
Buck–Boost converter produces either increased or decreased output voltage
magnitude for a given input voltage [5].

Design of Converter Models
The circuit diagram of the boost converter is shown in Fig. 1. The percentage of
conversion ratio of output voltage (Vo) to input voltage (Vin) also called duty cycle
(D) of Boost converter can be varied from 0 to 100% and is given by the relation as
Vo = Vin/(1 −D).
The circuit arrangement of the Buck–Boost converter is shown in Fig. 2. This
converter inverts the polarity of the output voltage, and therefore, it is also

considered as inverting converter. The conversion ratio of output voltage (Vo) to
input voltage (Vin) of Buck–Boost converter is given by the relation:
Vo ¼ Vin ½D= 1  D
ð
Þ
When the duty cycle is less than 50%, the converter works in Buck mode, and
when the duty cycle is between 50 and 100%, the converter works in boost mode.
At 50% duty cycle, the converter gives an output which is equal to the input
voltage.

Simulation of Boost and Buck–Boost Converters
The parameters listed in Table 1 have been used to simulate the open-looped
DC–DC boost converter and open-looped Buck–Boost converter in MATLAB
platform. The PWM block provides the pulse to the gate of the MOSFET switch.
The PWM block used for both the converters has been simulated as shown in
Fig. 3, and the simulated model of boost and Buck–Boost converters has been
shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively.

Development of the ANFIS Model
For the purpose of design and development of the ANFIS model, the most
important steps are collection of data, loading of data, and training the data sets.
The steps are discussed in details as follows:
• Collection of data: The Simulink model of the open-loop boost and Buck–Boost
converters as shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively, has been used to collect the
required data of output voltage. A total of 646 sets of simulated output data of
Boost and Buck–Boost converters have been obtained by varying one of the
input design parameters keeping the rest constant. The input design parameters
and their range of variations of values for both the converters have been listed in
Table 2.

• Loading of data: In this chapter, the input and output data sets obtained by
simulating the converter models have been arranged in the form of matrix where
the output data set occupied the last row in the matrix.
• Training of data sets: For the training process of the ANFIS model of the two
converters, the adaptive networks have been provided with input pattern which
is simulated output voltage value (Vo) and an output pattern which consists of
seven parameters, i.e., input voltage (Vin), inductance (L), parasitic inductive
resistance (Rl), capacitance (C), parasitic capacitive resistance (Rc), switching
frequency (Fs), and duty ratio (D). To evaluate the variation between the tar-
geted voltage (Vo) and the actual output voltage given by the ANFIS model,
hybrid learning algorithm consisting of least square method and back propa-
gation technique was implemented [4, 6–10]. The learning process continued till
the accuracy of the ANFIS output was maximum. The number of epoch for the
training process was kept as 50. The training particulars of the developed
ANFIS models for the two converters in this chapter have been listed in Table 3.
3.1
Algorithm for the Development of ANFIS Structure
MATLAB software was used to develop the ANFIS model. The algorithm for the
developed program has been mentioned below:
Step 1. The data pairs consisting of input voltage (Vin), inductance (L), parasitic
inductive resistance (Rl), capacitance (C), parasitic capacitive resistance
(Rc), switching frequency (Fs), duty ratio (D), and load (R) along with the
corresponding output voltage data pair (Vo) have been loaded.
Step 2. Command ‘genﬁs1’ has been used to generate the Sugeno-type FIS
structure with default input and output membership functions.
Step 3. Generalized bell membership function (gbellmf) has been chosen to
characterize the input parameter fuzzy sets.

Step 4. The total number of membership functions and the number of epoch have
been set as 50.
Step 5. To train the developed FIS structure, command ‘trndata’ has been used.
Step 6. To obtain the required output, the designed parameters corresponding to its
output voltage have been computed using command ‘evalﬁs’ which per-
forms the fuzzy inference calculations.
During the training process, the parameters related to the MFs changed
throughout the learning process till the error percentage is negligible. After the FIS
structure has been generated and trained using the appropriate training data.
A ﬁve-layer generalized ANFIS structure has been developed, where a hybrid
learning algorithm combining the least square technique and back propagation
technique has been implemented. The general ANFIS model is shown in Fig. 6.
Five layers have been represented, namely the fuzzy layer, the product layer, the
normalized layer, the defuzzy layer, and the output layer in the ANFIS structure
[11–16].

Result and Analysis
To validate the developed ANFIS model in this chapter, any desired input voltage
different training data set has been provided to the ANFIS model, and corre-
sponding values of 8 design parameters were collected as output. The design
parameters obtained from the ANFIS model for the corresponding user inputs were
then used to simulate the Simulink model shown in Figs. 4 and 5 accordingly, and
its corresponding output for both Boost and Buck–Boost converters was recorded
which has been mentioned in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.

The percentage error between the output obtained using ANFIS-generated
parameters and the user input of the Boost and Buck–Boost converters has been
shown in Tables 6 and 7, respectively, where the percentage error is calculated as:

parameters)/Simulated value] * 100.

Conclusion
The ANFIS model developed in this chapter can be established as an effective
alternative which eliminates the real-world problem of hard computation and
formula-oriented time-consuming mathematical computations to determine the
design parameters of any converter. For every new desired output voltage of a
speciﬁc range of the converters, one single model of the developed ANFIS structure
can compute all the necessary design parameters within a very short time and
without having to go through long mathematical calculations repeatedly. Also with

numerous number of soft computation methods like genetic algorithm and artiﬁcial
intelligence, ANFIS holds an edge over them as the complexity of evaluation,
learning, and defuzziﬁcation in ANFIS is simpler. The output of the developed
ANFIS model also holds advantage over other soft computation method as it
implements hybrid algorithm which results in optimized, less error-prone output.

Optimization of Induction Motor Using
Genetic Algorithm and GUI of Optimal
Induction Motor Design in MATLAB
Rakeshkumar Chaudhary, Rajesh Sanghavi and Sanjay Mahagaokar
Abstract In this paper, an optimal design of induction motor using genetic algo-
rithm is discussed and the results obtained are compared with a conventionally
designed induction motor. Graphical user interface (GUI)-based user simpliﬁed
interface is prepared in MATLAB to achieve an optimal design of different
power-rated three-phase squirrel cage induction motors. Full-load efﬁciency and
active material cost are chosen as an objective function to be optimized, and based
on that, the concept of dual optimization is explained. To achieve the best suitable
design, different variables are chosen and different constraints are imposed on the
design of induction motor.

Introduction
Increasing power demand is being a crucial issue in power sector from last some
years. Efforts are made to reach power demand and decrease demand generation
gap. So to solve this issue of demand generation gap, a new concept of optimization
is suggested [1].
A MATLAB-based program is developed for designing a three-phase squirrel
cage induction motor. “Full-load efﬁciency” and “active material cost” are taken as
an objective function. A 50 kW, 440 V, 50 Hz, 1000 RPM induction motor is

chosen for designing, and then, genetic algorithm is implemented on this motor for
efﬁciency and cost improvement in a way to increase efﬁciency and decrease cost.
Results of optimized design of induction motor are compared with the conven-
tionally designed induction motor to check for performance parameters and
real-time implementation. Graphical user interface in MATLAB gives the user a
ﬂexibility and easiness to user program for problem-solving in a much easier way.
So a generalized program is developed to design any kW motor and optimize that
design using genetic algorithm and then GUI of the same generalized program is
done for development of user-friendly environment.

Design Optimization of Induction Motor
The process of optimization of induction motor is expressed as follows:
Find Z (Z1, Z2, Zn), so that F(Z) is minimum [1], where F(Z) is an objective
function.
Satisfying; All desired constraints and all design variables within speciﬁed limits
are satisﬁed [2].
A. Design Variables
Design variables are basic parameters used in designing induction motor, and they
are made free to take any value within its limits to achieve best suitable design. For
proposed work, all these variable parameters are adjusted, so that for high efﬁciency
and low cost, an optimal or best design can be achieved (Table 1).
B. List of Constraints
Constraints are imposed on an optimal design of induction so that it satisﬁes certain
requirements. Main performance parameters are chosen as constraints. So while
running genetic algorithm, no constraint is violated and satisfactory design can be
achieved with all constraints to be satisﬁed (Table 2).

C. Objective Function
Objective functions are main performance parameter or main goal of whole design.
In this paper, proposed scheme of optimization is implemented choosing two dif-
ferent objective functions.
(1) full-load efﬁciency and
(2) active material cost
where
Full-load efﬁciency is deﬁned as follows:
Efficiency ¼ kW= kW þ Ptotal=1000
ð
Þ  100;
Active material cost is deﬁned as follows:
Cmaterial ¼ Ciron þ Ccopper;
Two different designs are prepared for two different objective functions. In
design 1, efﬁciency is chosen as an objective function so a feasible designed is
achieved in such a way that highest efﬁciency can be achieved satisfying all the
constraints. In design 2, active material cost is chosen as an objective function so a
feasible designed is achieved in such a way that low active material cost can be
achieved by satisfying all the constraints and also maintaining good efﬁciency but
not the highest.

Results and Discussion
I. Single-Objective Optimization
Efﬁciency and cost are chosen as two separate objective functions, and GA is
implemented as optimization technique. Comparison between conventionally
designed motor and optimally designed motor is made in a way to clearly under-
stand performance improvement and comparison.

A 50 kW, 50 Hz, 440 V, 1000 RPM induction motor is chosen. Two different
designs are prepared for two different objective functions:
Design 1: full-load efﬁciency as an objective function and
Design 2: active material cost as an objective function.
From the above results, it is shown that very good value of efﬁciency can be
obtained when efﬁciency is taken as an objective function and optimization is done
using genetic algorithm. But active material cost of the motor is higher compared to
Design 2.
Design 2 is prepared to choose active material cost as an objective function;
optimization is done; and a visible decrease in active material cost is achieved with
little compromise on efﬁciency.
II. Multiobjective Optimization Technique/Dual Optimization
Results presented in Table 3 shows that Design 1, in which efﬁciency is taken as
objective function, gives higher efﬁciency at higher cost compared to Design 2. In
Design 2, active material cost is taken as an objective function where cost deﬁnitely
decreases and efﬁciency also decreases. So we have to choose the best value of
efﬁciency or cost to compromise in another value of objective function. To solve
this problem, a method of “dual optimization” can be implemented with two

objective functions together. A NSGA-II program in MATLAB [3, 4] is used for
dual optimization with efﬁciency and active material cost as an objective function
(Fig. 1).
Above Graph shows the relation between two objective functions. This is
obtained using NSGA-II Program in MATLAB. A number of generations selected
are 200 and 50 populations for each generation. Average time taken for each
Generation is 0.0111 s. From above graph shows that with the higher efﬁciency,
cost of the motor is higher and it decreases with decrease in efﬁciency. So a proper
motor can be designed as per requirement from results obtained using NSGA-II
program using the concept of dual optimization.
III. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
As shown in Fig. 2, a MATLAB-based GUI is prepared for designing of induction
motor with single-objective function. In Fig. 2 a, demonstration is shown with
efﬁciency as an objective function. GUI gives the user a ﬂexibility to use program
easily and shows results in very user-friendly way. In the proposed GUI, certain
input parameters are to be fed and interface is made to run, which will give opti-
mized design of induction motor.

Conclusion
Design optimization of three-phase squirrel cage induction motor is presented in
this paper. Results show that when efﬁciency is considered as an objective function
and GA is implemented for optimization, efﬁciency increases to 2.12%; and when
active material cost is considered as an objective function and GA is implemented
for optimization, active material cost decreases to 19.15% compared to the con-
ventionally designed induction motor. Dual optimization can be successfully used
for two objective functions together, and motor can be designed as per the desired
performance requirement.

High Response Photon-Counting
for Phase Fraction Measurement
Using Compact-RIO with FPGA
Merina Mathew, N. Ramesh Babu, M. Suresh and P. Sanjeevikumar
Abstract This paper presents the measurement of phase fraction of multiphase
using LabVIEW/FPGA&RT. Phase fraction measurement is done by high-
frequency gamma ray photons attenuation from multiple scintillation detectors
without dead time between dwell intervals. This phase fraction measurement
method is based on the differences in the linear or mass attenuation coefﬁcient of
components of each phase to light. The electromagnetic wave attenuation based on
Beer-Lambert’s law gives the width of individual phases. Even though this method
requires shielding, it has the advantages of penetrating through steel. Other phase
fraction methods include differences in the permittivity of the components of
phases. The voltage across the two electrodes kept opposite to each other deter-
mines the phase fraction. But, it has the disadvantages of requirements of special
shielding for low capacitance and stray capacitance. Besides, the differences in the
conductivity can measure the path resistance. This conductivity change gives phase
fraction. Among the above volume—percentage measurement methods, former
method is more accurate for industrial applications.

Introduction
In industrial applications such as petroleum industry and thermal power plants, the
phase fraction measurement should be accurate since a minute change in the vol-
ume may cause a disaster. There are different methods such as void phase fraction,
capacitive measurements to measure the area of phases in a given cross section. The
disadvantages of these methods are that it produces dead time and lose data in some
intervals of time. This will be resulting in a big loss to the industry. In such
conditions, an accurate device is needed to measure the phase fraction at every
instant. In such a pondering, phase fraction measurement without dead time came
into existence.
Three gamma rays are passed through the water–gas mixture containing pipe-
line. Since the angle of fall of rays on the pipeline varies, the area of cross section
that the rays passing through will be different. Each ray captured at scintillation
counter varies, because of the quantity of ﬂuid that absorbs the rays is different. The
intensity of gamma rays is decayed after passing through the water–gas mixture
pipeline. The analog values—pressure of water, ﬂow of water, temperature of
water, differential pressure of air, pressure of air, temperature of air, air–water
mixture differential pressure, air–water mixture pressure, air–water mixture tem-
perature—are measured online and values for each microsecond is recoded.

Multiphase Flow
Multiphase describes multiple ﬂuid components in a ﬂowing stream. Difﬁcult
multiphase [1] measurement usually involves liquid–gas mixture such as water–air
mixture. The measurement difﬁculty comes into existence since the gas has the
tendency to separate [2] from liquid creating a heterogeneous ﬂuid. Fluids that can
emulsify easily can be mixed and measured accurately. To measure the multiphase
ﬂow, the count measurement of gas and liquid is taken separately.
The homogenization of two phases [3] and measure of the count for ﬁctitious
single phase are difﬁcult processes in industry for different ﬂow patterns [4]. But,
homogenization method is widely used in chemical engineering applications and
nuclear industry. The principle of the multiphase ﬂow is based on the bulk ﬂow or
mass ﬂow rate of the ﬂuid which gives the information about the phase fraction of
individual phases considering the slip between each phase is nil. Measurement of
multiphase ﬂow is very difﬁcult since it is characterized by extreme changes in the
ﬂow properties such as viscosity, density, and surface tension. Figure 1 shows the

High-frequency gamma [5] rays are passed through the pipeline containing water
or gas (air) or water–air mixture. The attenuated rays are captured at scintillation
detector kept after the pipeline. The attenuation is due to the linear absorption of
gamma rays by steel, with which the pipe is made, and the medium.
In scintillators, the ionizing radiations are converted into light pulses. The light
output of scintillator [5] is directly proportional to the energy deposited in the
radiation source. The photons, which are the output of the scintillation counter, are
converted into electrical signals by photomultiplier tube (PMT). The ampliﬁed
output from the PMT is further ampliﬁed by preampliﬁer circuitry. Preampliﬁer
produces pulse outputs whose amplitudes are proportional to the energy of incident
gamma photons. The radiation source used in this project is cesium 137. These
pulse outputs are fed through a chain of pulse processing circuitries consisting
mainly of pulse shaping spectroscopy ampliﬁer, energy discriminator, and ﬁnally
pulse counting interface hardware for computer.
The dwell time is the average time spent by a particle in a given region of space.
The duration of time in minutes is also added in the front panel. The less time
among total dwell time and total time in minutes will be selected, and up to that
time the count will be taken. These time settings should be presetted.
The basic clocking frequency of FPGA 9024 is 40 MHz. The frequency can be
multiplied or divided in accordance with the need. In this project, the frequency is
multiplied by two and made it 80 MHz. Since the count is to be taken in each
milliseconds and all the rising edge or all the falling edge should be noted, 80 MHz
is required. The fetching speed of the data in FPGA should be high in order not to
miss any pulses. The fetching speed of data by FPGA should be greater than the
storage speed in FIFO. The gamma ray frequency is of the order of maximum
10 MHz. Before started taking readings, initial values are resettled. Since same
values of time and count are shown in the excel sheet after taking readings, the
multiple same values are weeded out through a subprogram.

Design Requirements
Compact-RIO (C-RIO) with FPGA is used for receiving the instantaneous values of
analog signals, which are gamma rays [6]. C-RIO-embedded real-time controller is
programmed in LabVIEW. This depicted program can be converted into C program
by FPGA modules. In a particular dwell [7, 8] off time and dwell on time, the
signals from the radiation source are taken in FPGA and shifted to FIFO of host.
Cesium 137 is used as the gamma ray source and is shown in Fig. 2.
All compact-RIO will be having reconﬁgurable FPGA module. FPGA is used
for fetching of high-speed values. Since the FPGA has very low memory, the
captured values cannot be stored in it. The values in each microsecond are captured
by FPGA and shifted to the host computer. It is done with First In First Out

memory. The data will be stored in the host as an excel sheet. The data includes the
time (in seconds), number of signals, and eight analog values. In FPGA program,
the dwell time and the number of dwell intervals can be set manually. In Fig. 3,
C-RIO 9024 with two analog modules and one output digital module is shown.
Two analog modules 9203 are kept in the case as well as one digital module 9401 to
convert the counts in digital format.

Conclusion
In this paper, phase ﬂow measurement using high-frequency gamma ray emission
method for multiphase ﬂow measurement has been carried out. The method is
implemented using Labview/C-RIO hardware setup in the laboratory and validated
the results. Among multiphase ﬂow measurement using different methods done,
gamma ray emission is found to be the accurate method for multiphase ﬂow
measurement.

Numerical Stress Analysis of Artiﬁcial
Femur Bone
Sujoy Kumar Dey, Vikash Mainali, B.B. Pradhan
and Sutanu Samanta
Abstract Femur bone is one of the strongest bones of the human body, and it bears a
maximum weight of the body with the different types of daily life activities. In the
present study, we are trying to use semi-crystalline polymer such as polyetherether-
ketone (PEEK) and its composites such as hydroxyapatite-polyetheretherketone
(HA–PEEK) as a substitute for bone implant. First a solid cylinder was designed of
human bone, PEEK, and HA–PEEK, and the effect of compressive loading was
analyzed using directional deformation and Von-mises stress, respectively, in the
ANSYS. In the second analysis, a human femur bone was designed using software and
analysis was made using ANSYS for the compressive loading. From the analysis, it
can be seen that both PEEK and HA–PEEK have shown nearer Von-mises stress and
directional deformation as compared to that of a natural bone. HA–PEEK had more
close value as compared to the pure PEEK.

Introduction
In this modern era, lot of research has been going on in the ﬁeld of orthopedic
implants and lots of materials have been tried as a bone replacement. But none of
materials behaved like natural bone. Once the material have been implanted, there
are always chances of revision surgery, and this is due to the stress shielding which
makes the bone weaker and has to be replaced in due course of time. Revision
surgery at an old age is quite risky, and serious problem may occur during surgery.
Stress shielding occurs mainly in the metal implants [1].

The mentioned Eq. (1) was given by Weinans et al. [2].
To reduce the chances of revision surgery and stress shielding problem, we are
trying to ﬁnd out the polymer which have directional deformation and equivalent stress
(Von-mises) closer or nearer to the natural human bone. In this paper, we have taken
two polymer materials: one is PEEK, and the other is HA–PEEK. PEEK is a
semi-crystalline polymer having excellent mechanical properties and chemically inert
to most organic and inorganic chemicals. PEEK is a thermoplastic material which is
wear resistant having stability at high temperature [3]. It has a glass transition tem-
perature of 143 °C and a melting point of 335 °C. Some researchers have also
described the potential of PEEK in medical applications [4], and it can serve as a
replacement ofthemetalimplantsinorthopedic surgery[5].PEEKalsoremainedstable
during the process of sterilization process [6] and is biocompatible in both the cases of
in vivo and in vitro [7, 8]. It can be modiﬁed to increase its bioactivity by surface
modiﬁcation or incorporation of ﬁber into PEEK matrix [9, 10]. Previously, static
analysis has also been done on the artiﬁcial femur bone using different materials such as
Ti–Al—4 V and structural steel [11]. Analysis has been done for different loading
conditionssuch aswalking,standing,running,andjumping[12].Suchanalysishelps to
know about the stress distribution and from where the facture will occur due to loading.
2
Manufacturing
PEEK can be manufactured easily from injection molding, extrusion, conventional
plastic processing techniques [13, 14]. HA is the one common material that has
been used to increase the bioactivity of the PEEK. Various methods can be used to
140
S.K. Dey et al.

make a HA–PEEK composite, such as plasma spraying, cold spraying, and spin
coating. Plasma spraying method can be used to deposit metallic or nonmetallic
material in a molten or semi-molten state onto a different material [15].
High-quality HA coatings can be made using gas plasma sprays [16]. Cold spraying
has also been used by some researchers to coat PEEK with the HA. In cold
spraying, the particles are accelerated to a very high velocity toward a substrate.
The particles to be sprayed are kept below the melting point [17]. Spin coating has
also been done for coating HA over PEEK polymer. Zhang et al. [18] have man-
ufactured the HA–PEEK by selective laser sintering process and done the evalu-
ation of the cell attachment. Scaffold development of PEEK and HA has also been
done using the laser sintering process [19].

Modeling and Material Properties
(a) Modeling of Solid Cylinder
1. A circle of diameter 8 mm was drawn using a sketch tool.
2. The circle was extruded to 100 mm length along the normal direction (Figs. 1
and 2).
(b) Model of the Human Femur Bone
The material properties of PEEK [20], PEEK and HA in the ratio of 70:30 [21], and
human femur bone [22] are given in Table 1.

The density of the HA–PEEK is calculated using the formula of density of
composite, given by
qc ¼ qfvf þ qmvm
where qc; qf; qm is density of the composite, ﬁber, and matrix, respectively, and
vm; vf are the volume fraction of the matrix and the ﬁber.

Analysis

Analysis of the Solid Cylinder
Static analysis of the cylinder has been done considering the material to be isotropic
and homogenous. Material properties are assigned as given in Table 1.
Step 1: Meshing
Meshing was done all over the volume of the cylinder, with 66,722 nodes and
15,496 elements using a mesh tool. Figure 3 shows the meshed model.
Step 2: Condition for Analysis
One end of the cylinder has been ﬁxed, and a compressive load of 750 pa [5],
which is consider to be a weight of 75 kg person, is applied on the other end of the
cylinder. We have taken compressive load as during walking or standing the nature
of the load is compressive on the human femur bone. Figures 4 and 5 show the end
conditions.

Step 3: Results and Discussion
On the basis of the static structural analysis done in the ANSYS and considering the
results based on the Von-mises stress and directional deformation, Figs. 6 and 7
show the directional deformation and equivalent stress in all the three materials:
bone, PEEK, and HA–PEEK.
As per the static analysis of the natural bone, we ﬁnd the value of the directional
deformation is 3.513  10−8 m and the stress is equal to 1026.9 pa (maximum) and
373.87 pa (minimum) (Figs. 8 and 9).
As per the static analysis of the PEEK cylinder, we ﬁnd the value of the
directional deformation is 2.332  10−8 m and the stress is equal to 1175.1 pa
(maximum) and 179.38 pa (minimum) (Figs. 10 and 11).
As per the static analysis of the HA–PEEK cylinder, we ﬁnd the value of the
directional deformation is 1.099  10−8 m and the stress is equal to 1120.4 pa
(maximum) and 250.12 pa (minimum).
The above results are given in Table 2 for the comparison of the directional
deformation and equivalent stress.
From the analysis, it can been seen that HA–PEEK has closer properties as
compared to the natural bone and even its directional deformation is less than both
the bone and PEEK, so it can act as a substitute in orthopedic implants.

Analysis of Human Femur Bone
The static analysis has been on the model considering it to the isotropic and
homogenous material though the human femur bone is heterogeneous. Material
properties have been assigned as given in Table 1.
Step 1: Meshing
The geometry is meshed using a meshing tool into 34,362 nodes and 23,531
elements. Figure 12 shows the meshed geometry of human femur bone.
Step 2: Analysis Conditions
Human bone is inﬂexible so we had ﬁxed lower end of the femur bone.
A compressive load of 750 Pa [22] which is considered to be a weight of 75 kg
person is applied on the upper end. The changes in the equivalent stress and
directional deformation have been compared between natural bone and bone made
of PEEK, HA–PEEK. Figures 13 and 14 show the ﬁxed and compressive loading
conditions in human bone.
Step 3: Results and Discussion
On the analysis made on the ANSYS workbench using static structural following
results were produced (Figs. 15 and 16).

Abstract This chapter presents about one of the power quality improvement issues
such a current harmonic compensation in a shunt active power ﬁlter as power
quality issues distort the system. The control theory employed here is PI–hysteresis
controller-based instantaneous PQ current theory. Simulation is done in MATLAB
for a three-phase shunt active power ﬁlter, and the results of load current, ﬁlter
current, and source current have been veriﬁed before and after compensation.
An FFT analysis is done to evaluate the total harmonic distortion.

Introduction
Active power ﬁlter is used to cancel the harmonics and ripple-free currents [1].
Harmonics are generated by nonlinear loads. Harmonics originate from rectiﬁers
and cycloconverters (Figs. 5 and 7). Harmonics lead to overheating, malfunction,
and distortion. Control scheme is based on current modulation and harmonic

extraction. Harmonic extraction deals with extracting reference currents [2] using
active and reactive current theory and direct quadrature theory because of their
accurate results. Current modulator provides gate pulse to the converter.

Shunt Active Power Filter
Active power ﬁlters are divided into shunt and series that are connected in parallel
and series with the loads. As shunt APF cancels the distorted currents, series active
ﬁlter compensates the voltages as shown in Fig. 6. The control technique is incor-
porated to obtain ﬁltered currents, as shown in Fig. 8. APF consists of a voltage
source converter with a dc link capacitor with an energy storage device [3, 4]
(Fig. 1).

Instantaneous Vector Control Method
The active ﬁlter currents are produced using the above method. The transformations
used here are Parke and Clarke transformations. The transformations are applied to
load currents with respect to synchronous rotating frame of reference (Parke

PI Controller and Hysteresis Current Controller
The actual and the reference currents are compared, and the error is fed back to a
PI controller to track the reference current [5, 6]. The three-phase reference and
actual currents are fed back to hysteresis band which chooses the converter
switches [7, 8]. As the current switches, the lower switch of that phase has to be
switched ON, and as the current decreases, the upper switch has to be switched
ON which is in turn feedback as gate pulse to the converter [9, 10] (Fig. 3).

Abstract Synergy of optimum illumination and image processing techniques is a
very important aspect which needs to be incorporated in a machine vision envi-
ronment to improve the durability of the lighting unit and also to conserve power
requirements. This research work presents a novel way to optimize lighting
requirements in a machine vision system using image feature analysis and image
processing algorithms for texture identiﬁcation. The practical implementation could
be considered for automated machine vision environment for object surface
inspection and quality monitoring.

Introduction
Nowadays, in many of the automated manufacturing and packaging industries,
machine vision-based applications have a vital role in deﬁning the product quality
and ﬁnish. The need for a vision-based equipment in any manufacturing and
inspection process is a necessity due to the fact that human visual system has
limitations considering the environment conditions, robustness of deciphering an
image, ability to focus only on the ROI, pixel level object identiﬁcation, etc. All
these issues can be clearly addressed as per the user requirements, by using a right
combination of lens, camera, lighting equipment, corresponding data acquisition
hardware, and image processing software. With the advancement of automation
technology, production and inspection process in manufacturing companies have
become simpliﬁed using online visual inspection methods where in the scope of

human involvement all the stages are minimized. The production cycle, i.e., from
part production to inspection and packaging, is completely controlled and moni-
tored by a central server zone. Many researchers have contributed to the varied
ﬁelds consisting of machine vision applications. Chan et al. [1] have presented the
scope of machine vision applications in industries. Kumar [2] researched upon the
fabric defect detection applications in textile industry. Ke et al. [3] researched upon
the online surface inspection in steel industries. Yu et al. [4] researched upon the
micro-tool wear measurements using machine vision. Duan et al. [5] researched,
developed, and successfully implemented a prototype which can detect bottle
defects using machine vision application. Zhao et al. [6] researched and have
presented work for identifying wooden sample species identiﬁcation based upon the
shape and texture of the wooden surfaces. Jin-Cong et al. [7] have investigated
upon the wooden surface feature defect detection based upon texture features using
image processing parameters. Li et al. [8] have done in-depth study regarding tool
wear monitoring implementing image texture and segmentation analysis.
Taking inspiration from the above research works, this present research work
aims at addressing unmanned and quick visual inspections of engravings/texture
features on metallic surface objects in an automated industrial inspection
environment.

Experimental Setup
The image capturing is done in a static environment (Fig. 1) where the object of
interest which is a cylindrical aluminum (AISI 304 Grade) shaft specimen of cir-
cular cross section manufactured using facing operation, 14 mm in diameter,
50 mm in length, is kept stationary against an ideal background. The camera

distance from the object is also ﬁxed at 33 cm (setup followed resembles that of an
industrial product inspection environment). The camera and object are aligned
vertically in-line. Front lighting arrangement using LED ring lighting module is
opted for providing the required illumination upon the surface of the object.
2.1
Image Acquisition Environment
The ring lighting is mounted on the lens of the camera, and the illumination
conditions are controlled by tuning the LED ring lighting intensity which is con-
trolled by a voltage regulator to the desired luminance. The luminance is captured
by using a lux meter from time to time to get a measure of the increasing brightness
or darkness in the object environment.
The digital images are captured by the CMOS Marlin AVT grayscale camera
which is connected to a PC by the means of a corresponding hardware. The cap-
tured grayscale images are processed using corresponding image processing soft-
ware. The sequence of lighting conditions (Figs. 2 and 3) which is shown above
gives an overall understanding of the image capturing process and the functioning
of the entire experimental setup. The images are captured in 8-bit grayscale format.
The image resolution is 800  600 (Width  Height). Each image thereby consists
of 480,000 pixels. The intensity of the pixels ranges from 0 to 255 (gray level
values). The proposed work to understand lighting condition and surface
feature/texture detection is explained in Fig. 4.

Surface Pixel Intensities at Varying Lighting Conditions
Surface Image Maps: It is observed from the intensity maps that when there is a
change in the lighting intensity, surface texture has a corresponding pixel intensity
change. Shown in Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 are the surface images (left) and
corresponding grayscale images (right) at various illumination conditions. The
color in the intensity maps corresponds to grayscale intensity, where the color scale
from blue to red corresponds to gray values from 0 (blue) to 255 (red).
Observations: It can be seen that the surface features tend to appear in a distinct
manner at an illumination intensity of 19.96 lx in Fig. 8. In further sections of this
paper, the supporting criteria which make Fig. 8 an optimum image are veriﬁed by the
results of maximum feature edges detected by Canny algorithm in Fig. 17 and maxi-

Image Processing and Canny Edge Detection
4.1
Grayscale Image Representation
A 2D grayscale image f(x, y) can be represented as a matrix consisting of gray level
values ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white). This can be mathematically repre-
sented as:
f x; y
ð
Þ ¼

The row and column elements in the above matrix represent the gray intensity of
the image pixel at that particular point on the 2D image plane represented by I(x, y).
4.2
Canny Edge Criteria and Algorithm
John Canny proposed the Canny edge algorithm [9] and had come up with three
important criteria for optimum edge detection. It involves the following:
(a) SNR Value: True edges cannot be missed, and ﬁltration of spurious edges is
necessary. A high SNR (Eq. 1) means true edge is properly detected.

Filter impulse response of edge [−w, w] is f(x), RMS of Gaussian noise is d, and
E(x) is edge function.
(b) Accurate Edge Localization: This implies a minimal distance criteria between
actual edge and located edge. The located edge should be at sub-pixel vicinity
of the actual edge. Localization (Eq. 2) value should be high for detecting true
edges.

(c) Single Response Criteria: Multi-responses (non-maxima) to a single edge is
minimized. Single edge response (Eq. 3) is obtained. Xmax(f) is the pixel dis-
tance between the adjacent maxima in the response noise to f.

Step 3: Non-Maxima Suppression: Only the local maxima magnitude is retained,
and pseudo-edges are suppressed to get a reﬁned true edges.
Step 4: Hysteresis Thresholding: Higher and lower thresholds (TH and TL) are
set, and edges are marked based upon the gradient magnitude M(i, j) being linked in
the threshold range.
• If M(i, j) > TL implies, the point is an edge.
• If TL < M(i, j) < TH implies, the point is an edge, provided the adjacent pixels
are edge points, otherwise it is not an edge.
• If M(i, j) > TH implies, the point is an edge.

Harris Corner Points and FFT for the Image Sets
Harris Corner Points: Harris corner [10] (HC) points are pixel locations which
correspond to a region in the image where there is a signiﬁcant change in the pixel
intensity values surrounding the pivot pixel P(i, j). The detected corners are the
local maxima of an 8-pixel neighborhood for a pivot pixel P. Implementing the
Harris corner algorithm in MATLAB yielded the following results.
Observations: It is seen that at low illumination (Fig. 22), the detected Harris
corner points are 657 in number, and at optimum illumination (Fig. 23), there are
maximum Harris corner points detected (1035), indicating a wide range of texture
variations on the object surface, while at high illumination condition (Fig. 24), the
detected points are 392 in number, thereby indicating that the surface features are
not detected in an optimum manner at both high and low illumination conditions.

Fast Fourier Transform: Converting the image into a frequency domain signal
helps in understanding the edge features in a profound manner. To understand
brieﬂy, “higher magnitude response for an image using Fourier transform indicates
edgier image texture.” Implementing Fourier transform for the image sets, it has
been observed that at an illumination of 19.96 lx, the maximum Fourier magnitude
was obtained which indicates that the image with the optimum edge features and
best surface texture is obtained at the corresponding illumination condition.
Inference: In this experimental work, it is seen that illumination conditions
above 19.96 lx are not needed for optimum surface feature inspection. Voltage
requirements and corresponding power for the LED lighting unit can be optimized
by utilizing only the required luminance from the lighting unit, which can be
calibrated and set using image parameters and their values.

Conclusion
From this research work, it can be concluded that for identifying optimum surface
texture, image parameters such as edges, corner points, Fourier magnitude, and
surface maps have been found highly useful for validation, and accordingly, the
illumination conditions can be modulated for obtaining the best surface features
based upon the image parameters, giving a synergy between lighting control and
image processing in a machine vision environment.

Accuracy Analysis of Machine Vision
for Detection of Malignant Melanoma
Using Pixel Intensity Matrix Parameters
Punal M. Arabi, Gayatri Joshi, Surekha Nigudgi

Abstract Malignant melanoma is a life threatening disease which develops in the
skin cells and has the potential to spread the other parts of the body. Early detection
and treatment not only increase the survival rate but also reduce the cost of treat-
ment. Sun exposure/ultraviolet exposure, free radicals and history of melanoma in
ﬁrst degree relative are important few factors of the many factors which cause
malignant melanoma. Image processing and image analyzing techniques can be
intelligently employed for computer aided diagnosis of malignant melanoma. Every
year 132,000 people are affected by skin cancer worldwide. This paper proposes a
method for the computer aided diagnosis of malignant melanoma using pixel
intensity matrix parameters; the accuracy of the proposed method is also found. The
results obtained show that the proposed method may be useful for developing an
automated diagnosis system for malignant melanoma.

treatment is also reduced [1]. Main factors that cause melanoma are over exposure
to sunlight and genetic factors [2]. Skin cancer can be reduced by limiting or
avoiding over exposure to the UV (ultraviolet) radiation. Early detection of mela-
noma is given by the mnemonic “ABCDE”: Asymmetry; Borders (irregular);
Color; Diameter (greater than 6 mm (0.24 in.) Evolving over time.
Sadeghi et al. [3] proposed a method for melanoma diagnosis by identifying the
presence or absence of streaks in skin lesions, analyzing and classifying the
detected streaks in pigmented skin lesions.
Sirakov et al. [4], proposed two automatic skin lesion classiﬁcation systems to
identify the malignant and benign based on the shape, texture and color features. Ali
et al. [5], developed a computer aided diagnosis system to assist dermatologists to
detect the lesion boundary with highest diagnostic accuracy. Sáez et al. [6],
described a method using local and global patterns to detect melanocytic lesions.
Abdul Jaleel et al. [7], proposed the artiﬁcial neural network and image processing
techniques for diagnosing skin cancer instead of going for biopsy test. Li et al. [8],
developed a new approach using a spectroscopic device to extract the features of the
image based on statistical measurements. Jose Luis García Arroyo et al. [9],
developed an algorithm for the detection of reticular pattern over dermoscopic
images to diagnose malignant melanoma.
The diagnosis of malignant melanoma by ABCDE parameters is a popular
method. Out of these parameters color variation in a mole gives a notable clue about
the nature of the mole i.e. whether it is normal or abnormal. This paper proposes a
novel method for diagnosis of malignant melanoma using pixel intensity matrix
parameters and computer vision.

Methodology
In the proposed method as shown in Fig. 1, pre-processing is done on acquired
images and here the color variation of the mole is taken for experimentation and the
proposed method attempts to develop a pilot computer aided diagnosis system for
the detection of malignant melanoma by the pixel intensity matrix parameters; the
proposed method involves two stages as
(1) Image enhancement
(2) Filtering by low pass ﬁlter.
For this work a set of 30 images of cancerous and normal moles are taken for
analysis. The acquired images are RGB images and hence converted into gray
images. ROI from the gray images of 400–600 pixel size are then identiﬁed. Pixel
intensity matrix from these ROI’s are found from which co-variance, standard
deviation and maximum intensity level of pixels are calculated and tabulated.

Decision Rule
If the values of the pixel intensity parameters of the image of concern are greater
than the threshold values, the image is a suspicious one, may be a malignant mole.
If the values are lesser than the respective threshold values, the image of interest
may be a normal one. The threshold values are calculated by two methods as
explained below.
Method-1: Average values of pixel intensity parameters of normal images are ﬁxed
as threshold values.
Method-2: The average values of all parameters of the normal images are found
and is denoted as x. The values greater than the average values are found; a data set
is created of these values and is represented as X. Using the following relation the
reference values (threshold values) are arrived at as:

The pixel intensity matrices of these moles are obtained. The average values of
the parameters namely co-variance, standard deviation, Δfv (mode) are found. To
ﬁnd Δfv (mode), every image is divided into 4 quadrants and this would lead to 4fv
(Maximum pixel intensity values) values for every image. Out of these values
maximum and minimum values are found from which Δfv (mode) is calculated as
Δfv = [maximum fv −minimum fv]. Table 2 shows the parameters with average
values. Using these average values the accuracy analysis of machine vision method
for diagnosis malignant melanoma is carried out by two methods as described in the
decision rule section. In method-1, the average values are taken as threshold values
or reference values. By method-1, abnormal moles are found out very accurately
where as normal moles are not accurately classiﬁed; 40% of false positive results
are found in our experiment (i.e. the normal moles are classiﬁed as abnormal
moles). To reduce the false positives, an empirical relation is proposed in method-2
as R ¼ x þ P X  x
ð
Þ=N. In this method the reference value R is calculated using
the above relation. The accuracy obtained by this method reduces false positives.
Though it introduces few false negatives (i.e. abnormal moles are classiﬁed as
normal moles), the overall efﬁciency obtained by this method is much greater
compared to method-1.

conﬁrmed only after experimenting with many more images and after clinical
studies.

Investigation of Perylene as a Converter
Material for Fast Neutron Detection
and Spectroscopy Using GEANT4
Monte Carlo Simulations

Abstract Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to investigate the
perylene (C20H12) as a converter layer for fast neutron detection and spectroscopy.
Perylene is an organic semiconductor material having high hydrogen content which
could be utilized as a medium of elastic scattering for fast neutrons to produce
recoil protons such as in proton recoil detector. This charged recoil proton would
further liberate e-hole pairs while traversing through the material which will induce
the detector’s response in the associated electronics with appropriate applied
reverse voltage. Perylene is used as a neutron converter layer on top of the wide
band-gap semiconductor material such as silicon carbide (SiC) which can maintain
its typical characteristics even in the harsh radiation environment. SiC would help
in efﬁcient charge collection resulting from recoil proton. The thickness of perylene
as a converter layer was optimized and found to be *500 lm for wide energy
range of fast neutrons. This work would further aid in the comparative study of
different converter material for SiC-based fast neutron detector.

Introduction
Neutron detectors are employed for nuclear applications such as monitoring of
nuclear reactor core, fuel reprocessing plant [1], special nuclear material detection,
and high-energy physics experiments, and for fast neutron radiation therapy [2].
Gas-ﬁlled neutron detectors are currently being used for nuclear applications that

could not provide the energy spectrum which is a major drawback along with other
shortcomings such as gas purity, space charge effect, wall effect, high voltage
supply requirement, bulky structure [3]. These gas-ﬁlled detectors have high radi-
ation hardness in comparison to semiconductor detectors. Si-based semiconductor
detectors are very much prone to radiation induce defects [4]. Recent research in the
area of wide band-gap semiconductors has revealed a new era of semiconductor
detectors which are unsusceptible to radiation-induced damages. Wide band-gap
semiconductors such as silicon carbide (SiC), boron nitride (BN), aluminum nitride
(AlN), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and gallium nitride (GaN) are extensively being
researched for the development of radiation hard detectors [5–12]. SiC, with wide
bang-gap of *3.25 eV and displacement threshold energy of 21.8 eV [5, 13], has
shown a great potential to become a future material of choice for harsh environment
radiation detectors. SiC can detect neutron directly and indirectly. Silicon and
carbon atoms in SiC can directly undergo elastic and inelastic scattering reaction
upon interaction with fast neutrons [14–16]. A layer of neutron converter material
would further enhance the detection efﬁciency [15, 17]. A low-Z hydrogenous
material is preferred for neutron converter since it has a higher cross section for
elastic scattering with fast neutrons [3]. We have optimized the thickness of
hydrogenous converter layer polyethylene in our previous work [18]. Recoil proton
generated in converter would lose part of its energy in converter itself which could
not be collected, thus resulting in a continuum of energy spectrum. A. Kargar et al.
have reported a fast neutron detector based on organic semiconductor, i.e., perylene
[19]. Perylene has good optical properties and thermal stability, and it is generally
used for blue-emitting dopant material in OLEDs [20]. Since the mobility of
electrons and holes in perylene is low, i.e., 5.5 and 87.4 cm2/V s at 60 K,
respectively, [21] which could hinder the efﬁcient charge collection process.
Therefore, to increase the charge collection efﬁciency (CCE), we have presented
perylene as a hydrogenous neutron converter material in this work. Perylene upon
interaction with fast neutrons would generate recoil proton which will further lib-
erate e-hole pairs in SiC detector active region. This method of fast neutron
detection is primarily known as proton recoil method [3]. It must be noted that as
we increase the thickness of converter, more number of neutrons will interact
resulting in a large number of recoils [18]. But these recoils will have a certain
range in a particular material. If the thickness of converter is more than the range of
energetic recoil, most of the recoils will die out in converter itself, or it may
enter detector active area with very less energy which can be considered as a
background. Thus, Monte Carlo-based GEANT4 [22] simulations have been per-
formed to optimize the thickness of perylene for the wide energy range of neutron
detection.

GEANT4 Simulation Methodology
GEANT4, stands for GEometry ANd Tracking, is a simulation toolkit for particle
transport through matter. It has a complete range of functionality including tracking,
geometry, physics models, and processes [23]. It is capable of tracking down the
secondary particles generated due to the primary reaction. It provides a vast set of
well-deﬁned physics models including hadronic, electromagnetic, and optical
process from low energy to very high energy range [24]. It has been developed with
software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in C++
programming language. The neutron transport class library described in GEANT4
simulates the interactions of neutrons with kinetic energies from thermal energies
up to 20 meV.
2.1
Model Description
GEANT4.10.01 version is used to build the detector model. The planar detector
geometry has been constructed using GEANT4 geometry category class as shown
in Fig. 1. It consists of a converter layer of perylene (density 1.28 g/cc) with 1 cm2
front face (XY-plane), and thickness (Z-axis) is varied from one micrometer to few
millimeters using GEANT4 macro ﬁle to optimize the thickness of converter. Here,
optimized thickness represents the thickness at which the detector efﬁciency is
maximum [25]. In other words, the thickness at which, maximum number of recoil
protons will stretch out of the converter layer into the SiC semiconductor to gen-
erate a detectable signal. Adjacent to the converter is a detector layer made up of
SiC with similar XY-plane, and thickness is kept at 500 lm as shown in Fig. 1.
General Particle Source Class of particle category has been used to generate neutron
of various energies and spectrum of 241Am-Be neutron source. ROOT, a data
analysis framework [26], is integrated to generate various histograms. In order to
optimize the converter thickness, 108 neutrons have been simulated 5 times at
different converter thickness for different energy neutron sources.

Results and Discussion
3.1
SiC as a Neutron Detector
SiC exists in about 250 crystalline forms [27], and similar crystalline structures are
termed as polytypes. Major polytypes are 3C–SiC, 4H–SiC, and 6H–SiC. 4H–SiC
polytype is a popular choice for radiation detectors due to its substantially higher
electron transport properties and higher band-gap compared to other polytypes [28].
SiC can be used directly to detect fast neutron. Silicon and carbon atoms in SiC will
undergo elastic to generate 28Si or 12C recoils, respectively, and inelastic scatterings
to produce alpha, protons, or other charged particles as per their reaction cross
section [29]. Energy deposition in SiC due to neutron interaction is demonstrated in
Fig. 2. Most probable reaction, i.e., elastic scattering will produce Si and C recoils.
We have generated 241Am–Be neutron source with 107 events for demonstration
purpose. Table 1 listed out the major particles produced in SiC detector. A layer of
neutron converter layer to increase the efﬁciency is discussed in next section.

SiC Detector with Neutron Converter Layer
A layer of hydrogenous converter layer would signiﬁcantly increase the detection
efﬁciency of SiC-based detectors [15]. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) is gen-
erally used as a converter layer for fast neutron detection. Optimized thickness for
HDPE is taken as *500 lm [18] for comparison of energy deposition in SiC with
and without converter layer. From Fig. 2, it is evident that having a converter over
SiC detector would enhance the energy deposition in detector active layer which
will result in better efﬁciency.
Recoil proton would deposit part of its energy in converter before reaching the
active layer of the detector. Figure 3 shows the energy which is lost or unexploited
in the converter by recoil proton. A substantial amount of energy is being lost in
polyethylene converter which would certainly limit the energy resolution of the
spectrum and of course, hamper the efﬁciency.
A material which could assist the charge collection even from the unexploited
energy lost in converter would deﬁnitely augment the efﬁciency of the detector and
further magnify the energy resolution. A converter layer based on conductive
polymers or organic semiconductor could be presumed to unravel this argument.
We are proposing perylene as a converter layer after being motivated from [19].
3.3
Perylene as a Converter Layer for SiC Detector
In order to employ perylene as a converter, we have performed Monte Carlo
simulations to optimize its thickness for the wide energy range of neutron. Further,
a special case of 241Am–Be neutron source has been taken up to analyze the various
energy spectrum in SiC detector. Figure 4 represents an efﬁciency of perylene
converter-based SiC detector as a function of converter thickness for different
energy neutrons. From this plot, optimum thickness could be determined for the
wide energy range of neutron. Optimum thickness could be contemplated as the
thickness which can provide adequate recoils in the detector active region. We have
estimated *500 lm as an optimum thickness for perylene converter layer. The

thickness of perylene is also optimized for a particular case of 241Am–Be neutron
source which is having a mean energy of *4.177 meV. It is found that for 241Am–
Be neutron source, the optimized thickness is *500 lm (Fig. 5), which is in good
agreement with our wide energy range optimization estimation.

Calculation of Energy Deposition
Figures 6 and 7 represent the histograms of total energy deposited and energy
deposited by recoil proton in the active region of SiC detector, respectively. These
energy spectrums show the potential of perylene converter with SiC detector to be
employed as a fast neutron spectrometer.

Conclusion
GEANT4 simulations have been performed to investigate neutron transport and
interaction in SiC detector along with perylene converter layer. Reactions due to
neutron interactions that are happening in SiC are tabulated along with their mean
energy and range. Improvement in SiC detector efﬁciency has been demonstrated
by applying a neutron converter layer, i.e., polyethylene. To minimize the unused
deposited energy in polyethylene converter, organic semiconductor material per-
ylene is propounded. The thickness of perylene converter layer has been optimized,
and it is found to be *500 lm. Spectroscopic capabilities of perylene converter
with SiC detector has been demonstrated using various histograms. Hitherto, it is
unclear, how the difference in charge collection efﬁciency (CCE) of perylene and
SiC will affect the overall CCE of detector, but it could be a worth area to explore
further. Our GEANT4 model could further assist in the study of converter layer for
fast neutron detection and spectroscopy.

Spectral Analysis and Comparison
of Single-Carrier PLC Modules
in Narrowband Power Line
Communication System
Srihari Mandava, Abhishek Gudipalli and G. Vidhya Sagar
Abstract In recent times, power line communication (PLC) has an ability of
communicating the signals and messages making use of the existing power lines
without going for new mediums such as optical ﬁbers or radio waves. Considering
the voltage, electrical networks are rated as low (1 kV), medium (1–100 kV), and
high (>100 kV) networks and the communication problems in these networks
increase with increase in voltage. In order to establish high-speed data communi-
cations with data rates in the range of megabit/s over power line networks, dedi-
cated communication systems considering the hostile channel properties are
required. In addition to signal distortion, losses in cables and multipath propagation,
noise from the system also plays a key role to alter the digital communication over
power line networks which is dealt in this project. In this work, the signals are
obtained with less bit error rate (BER) using Rayleigh fading channel improving the
efﬁciency of the whole system. Different modulation techniques are compared in
narrowband power line communication (PLC) systems, and some suggestions are
made for the improvement of data transmission in narrowband systems. The best
compromise for single-carrier PLC modules between efﬁciency and architecture
complexity is being investigated in this project.

Introduction
PLC is a protocol of communication used to transfer both digital signal and electric
signal simultaneously. PLC is also called as power line carrier, power line net-
working (PLN), and power line digital subscriber line (PDSL). The concept of power
line communication was ﬁrst introduced in the 1950s and was used for controlling
the one-way remote relays operating at a frequency of 10 Hz and at a power rating of
10 kW. Later in the 1980s, research was carried out [1]. In the next step, the
narrowband power line communication (PLC) was used for telemetry purpose in
high-voltage lines with a frequency range of 15–500 kHz of which is still playing its
role in power line communication [2]. The very ﬁrst test for the bidirectional data
transfer was done in 1997 by Ascom in Switzerland. Nowadays, the concept of
power line communication is used in the smart grids to establish a two-way com-
munication over the existing power distribution network. Modern power networks
comprise of a variety of alternate energy sources and much advanced energy con-
suming devices. These advanced sources include solar power sources, wind mills
and smart appliances and electric vehicles on the consuming end.
Load management is the main aim of power line communication. The present
methods have the drawbacks of consuming more power for information transmis-
sion. The second goal is to make the possibility of electrical meter reading from a
distance. A meter reader using PLC is shown in [3] which gets the information at a
rate of only 1 bit/s. Tokyo Electric Power Co carried out some successful experi-
ments in the 1970s showing the ﬂow of information in both the directions (bidi-
rectional) with several hundred units [4]. This narrowband PLC technique can also
be used for the detection of fraud, power theft, switching on and off loads, load
shedding, and demand response. Broadband PLC system was developed by AT&T
[3] to provide Internet services over the existing power line network and with the
help of the power grid. In this, the frequencies at which the current and data signals
vibrate should not match with each other. This method has the disadvantages of
noise introduction and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). Qun et al. designed a
power line communication system based upon the FSK-KQ 330 [6] module and
analyzed that when there is no data transmission, the signal in the transmit pin is a
straight line. It was also seen that the data transmission values at low voltages are
nearly same as obtained in the theoretical calculations. Manfred Zimmermann et al.
showed the effect of broadband noise on a PLC network in [5]. In this, the PLC
system developed at a frequency range of a few kilohertz to a few megahertz does
not experience any additive white gaussian noise but is only interfered by nar-
rowband noises and impulsive noises in this particular frequency band. The noise
can be a background, narrowbanded, periodic, and asynchronous to the main fre-
quency and periodic impulsive noise.
Dan Raphaeli of Itran Communications et al. [5] showed the differences of
OFDM, spread spectrum, and single carrier for high-rate data transmission through
PLC. In this work, the FSK was a technique used for transmission in narrowband
signal and a major part of the signal was distorted with high spectral density. On the
200
S. Mandava et al.

other hand, the OFDM technique used for the data transmission through broadband
could be used on any practical distorting channel. The implementation of OFDM
technique is quite tough than the implementation of the FSK techniques used in
narrowband PLC system. The spread spectrum was able to transmit at all the band
frequencies, and this transmission depends only on the positive signal-to-noise ratio
of the spectrum.
This paper will help in study of different modulation techniques in narrowband
power line communication (PLC) systems and will help to determine that which of
all the techniques used is best on the basis of BER versus SNR ratio and with the
help of Simulink model. The signals are obtained with less bit error rate
(BER) using Rayleigh fading channel improving the efﬁciency of the whole system.
The best compromise for single-carrier PLC modules between efﬁciency and
architecture complexity is also investigated. In this paper, Sect. 2 gives brief
introduction to different modulation techniques, Sect. 3 explains about the classi-
ﬁers of binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK), amplitude-shift keying (ASK), and
phase-shift keying (PSK) used in single-carrier modulation, and Sect. 3 gives the
result analysis of the classiﬁers comparing with each other.

Feature Extraction
Modulation is a technique which is used to send signals of low frequency to a large
distant place by using another high frequency without much loss of the binary data.
The main reason for sending a low-frequency data by combining along with high
frequency is that the high frequency has less wavelength and thus because of this
reason it suffers less diffraction. The procedure by which original signal is received
from a modulated signal is known as demodulation. A modulated wave consists of
different carrier or sideband signals. In a PLC system, the process of demodulation
is used to extract the binary data which is sent from the sending end. The quality of
this data depends upon the modulation and demodulation techniques used for
sending the signal from the sending end to the receiving end. There are different
types of modulation and demodulation techniques used to transmit the signal from
one end to the other end.
2.1
Single-Carrier Modulation
In this, a section of bits are associated with a group of symbols. Fourier coefﬁcients
are set for various transmitters, i.e., the users by mapping and demapping of blocks.
The reverse section has the modules for IDFT, demapping and to detect user signal.
Guards’ symbols are implemented between different blocks of symbols to put an
end to the interference of intersymbol caused by time widening across the blocks. In
single-carrier modulation, mapping is of two types, i.e., localized mapping and

distributing mapping. The mapping which has the subcarriers set for the DFT
outputs of input data restricts them to small fraction of the bandwidth in system is
called localized mapping and the one in which the DFT outputs of input data are
allocated to subcarriers for the whole bandwidth is called distributed mapping.
2.2
Multicarrier Modulation
This is a technique which divides the stream of bits into several bit streams. Each
bit stream will have a lower bit rate and are used to modulate several carriers. After
receiving the overall transmission, the receiver has then to reassemble the overall
data stream received from the individual carriers. The concept of multicarrier
modulation is based on several channels which are isolated from other using
steep-sided ﬁlter. The interference from different available channels is eliminated in
this manner. Initially, the multicarrier modulation technique was mainly used in the
broadcasting systems such as digital amplitude modulation and video broadcasting.
The different multicarrier modulation techniques are orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM), generalized frequency-division multiplexing, and ﬁlter bank
multicarrier.
2.2.1
Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing
OFDM has number of closely spaced modulated carriers. The receiver receives the
complete signal and then demodulates the signal. So when a signal is transmitted,
the receiver segregates the received signal from transmitted. The receiver passes the
received signal through a ﬁlter and the guard is used between the signals to prevent
interference with each other. In an OFDM signal, the primary requirement is that
the signal must be linear in nature otherwise the overlapping of signals would take
place and will cause disturbance the orthogonality of the transmitted signal. The
data to be sent by the OFDM signal is passed onto the carriers of the signal so that
each carrier takes the payload, thus reducing the data rate on each carrier. When the
data rate gets reduced, the main advantage is that interference from the other signals
is less and does not affect the data in signal much. This is because of the guard band
introduced into the system. Thus, the data is sampled only when signal is stable and
no other signals altering the time and phase of the signal.
2.2.2
Generalized Frequency-Division Multiplexing
Generalized frequency-division multiplexing is the latest idea for ﬂexible multiple
carrier transmission that provides with extra degrees of freedom as compared to new
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing. In this, the pulse-shaping ﬁlter is
responsible for out of band radiation of the transmitted signal applied to the
202

individual subcarriers. In order to reduce the number of carriers, the size of the
block is a variable parameter.
2.2.3
Filter Bank Multicarrier
This type of modulation technique depends upon the division of frequency spec-
trum into many narrowband frequency channels. It completely depends upon the
high performance of the DSP processors because channel estimation and equal-
ization becomes a trivial task. With the insertion of some redundancy, the
frequency-selective channel becomes a frequency ﬂat subchannel. The required
level of selectivity and separation can be achieved by using the ﬁlter bank itself.

Classiﬁer
The different types of single-carrier modulation techniques used in power line
communication system are listed as follows.
3.1
Binary Frequency-Shift Keying (BFSK)
Binary frequency-shift keying [1] is the technique which is used to transmit the binary
data through the changes of discrete frequency in a carrier wave. In this type, a discrete
pair of frequencies are used which are used to transmit data. In this frequency-shift
keying, ‘1’ is called mark frequency and ‘0’ is called space frequency.

where m(t) = 0 or 1, T is bit duration, A is amplitude, fc is frequency, and x0 is phase.
3.2
Amplitude-Shift Keying (ASK)
Amplitude-shift keying involves the digital modulation in which the carrier wave
amplitude gets modiﬁed in a completely discrete manner. There can be a number of
baseband signals which are given by the formula

where A is a constant, m(t) = 1 or 0, fc = carrier frequency and T = the bit duration.
3.3
Phase-Shift Keying (PSK)
Phase-shift keying is the technique which is widely used in the radio communication.
It is one of the best suited techniques to use for the purpose of data communications
through PLC system. In phase-shift keying, there are deﬁned states or points which are
used for sending the bits. When a digital signal is transmitted through a line, it creates
amplitude reversals between 1 and −1, thus leading to phase reversals of 1800 phase
shifts. The main problem used while using the phase-shift keying is that the user at
receiver end is not able to determine that whether it is in space or mark condition.

Analysis
Analysis of signals plays a key role in signal communication and signal processing
and it is a tough task for all researchers and scientists. It is always important to
know the information on the signal’s properties and signal analysis is the only tool
used for this purpose. As part of signal analysis, spectrum analysis and vector signal
analysis are used for analyzing the electrical signals. In this, we tend to solve the
problem of excess BER with introducing a Rayleigh fading channel to the system
and operate it with the gain. Rayleigh fading is the name which is given to the
fading experienced by large number of reﬂections. This fading uses a statistical
approach to analyze the propagation and is used in a number of domains. The
Rayleigh fading model is particularly useful when the signal gets scattered between
the transmitter and receiver. The attenuation that happens due to multipath fading in
wireless channels can be solved by Rayleigh fading (for the case where no line of
sight component present). A Rayleigh random variable R has the probability

For a wireless channel, the envelope of the channel response is modeled to have
a Rayleigh distribution. The output graph for each classiﬁer with and without
Rayleigh channel is shown in Figs. 7, 8, and 9. The outputs give us a general idea
that even on using the Rayleigh fading channel the BER value of the plot remains
same as without the Rayleigh gain. On considering the time value of the sequences,
the differences can be shown in Figs. 10 and 11.
5.1
BER Analysis
BER analysis is the method to determine the BER versus SNR ratio and get a plot
accordingly for a system. In this project the BER analysis is done by getting the
BER values of the system at different SNR value having a speciﬁc range and
sample time. The tool plots graph at all SNR values starting from the lower limit to
the upper limits with the ranging sample time. The values of BER also can be
displayed if needed. In this simulation work, a general QAM modulator/
demodulator baseband is used for the execution of the Amplitude-Shift Keying
(ASK) technique. For the exact execution of the work, the noise has also been
added which is an AWGN channel. There are two operations: one with complex
path gain of the Rayleigh fading channel and one without the gain involved.
The results involved in both the scenarios are different as shown in Figs. 7, 8, 9, 10,
and 11.

The result suggests that lately increasing the simulation time would result in
increase in BER ratio, i.e., the errors for a larger sample time would be high as
compared to lower simulation time, with an increase in SNR ratio. The simulation
result for the same with different simulation times and with Rayleigh fading channel
reduces the errors.

Conclusion
This paper is aimed to get the comparison of different modulation techniques used
in narrowband PLC system. The differences in the modulation techniques were
ﬁgured out using various MATLAB and Simulink tools. This paper gave us an
insight on how the different modulation techniques (ASK, FSK, and PSK) would
respond to different parameters such as simulation time which can be seen as the
measure of time for which the data is being transferred or the SNR ratio. The
simulation results for the techniques brief us about the possible usage of techniques
in various scenarios. The PSK modulation technique will be a better option to use
than the other two variants but only if the SNR ratio of the system lies below 4 dB
for higher SNR values. The technique would fall behind FSK which has a lesser
error probability, i.e., lesser BER ratio. This justiﬁes the theoretical results of FSK
being better option than PSK for lower bandwidth, i.e., the narrowband systems.

Three-Level Flying Capacitor Multilevel
Inverter Is Used to Suppress Harmonics
at the Output of 3-Phase Inverter Drive
and Study of Heat at Various Parts
of 3-Phase Induction Motor
B. Rajesh and Manjesh
Abstract Harmonics are the major cause for degradation of an induction motor;
these unwanted harmonics deteriorate the motor performance. In literature, many
researchers have studied that application of multilevel inverter suppresses the
harmonics. The multilevel inverter has three major types cascaded, diode clamped,
and ﬂying capacitor. The output of multilevel inverter is more sinusoidal than of
normal inverter. This work shows normal 2-level inverter constructed with six
switches and 3-level ﬂying capacitor multilevel inverter constructed with twelve
switches experimentally to study the harmonics and total harmonic distortion
(THD). Temperature at various parts of the 3-phase induction motor is obtained by
placing J-type thermocouples. The motor is run with 9-Hz input frequency for a
period of 4-h duration. V/f control method is employed to control speed of the
motor. Temperatures obtained for 4-h duration with normal inverter and multilevel
inverter are compared. The harmonics and THD is obtained by using a power
analyzer for both the inverters, and the results are compared. The load for the motor
is kept at 500 g for both inverter topologies, the analysis and reduction of harmonic
content are employed to study the 3-phase induction motor temperature, and results
are presented experimentally.

Introduction
The core of most modern dc/ac inverter circuits has the concept of multilevel
inverter, which enhances the quality of power by introducing various steps of
voltage in line to neutral voltages. The losses are less, and improved electromag-
netic compatibility is add-on beneﬁts using multilevel inverters. The multilevel
inverters are an enhanced structure of the traditional power inverters which are
universally accepted and have found different applications, for example, motor
drives. The working of multilevel inverter depends on the construction and number
of switches in each leg of the inverter [1, 2]. The multilevel starts form 3-level, and
it can be raised to any number of voltage levels. The inverter performance could be
improved by increasing the switches per leg in circuit. The number of levels at the
output in a multilevel inverter is determined by the number of switches. The voltage
levels in the output at the load are increased as the number of switches in the
multilevel inverter is increased and inverter output voltage becomes more and more
sinusoidal structure. The most important feature of multilevel inverter is its ability
to reduce the stress of voltage on each switch; the more number of levels in the DC
bus of circuit allows for development in steps. This has the highest priority,
especially when DC voltage applied is very high which is required to drive the load.
The multilevel inverter’s output power fed to an electrical motor which improves
the performance of the motor by a extreme level [3, 4]. The content of harmonic
voltage applied to terminals of the motor is reduced by large amount. The major
source of the motor failures is identiﬁed to be high dv/dt effects produced by the
traditional or normal inverter drives. The multilevel inverter produces a multi-
stepped output voltage; this will prevent failures of motor by the reduction of rate of
change of (dv/dt) voltage. The major concern of using a multilevel inverter is that, it
requires additional number of switches. The multilevel inverters are classiﬁed into
three major topologies: cascaded multilevel inverter (CMI), diode clamped multi-
level inverter (DCMI), and ﬂying capacitor multilevel inverter (FCMI). FCMI uses
a capacitor for clamping the switches in each phase leg to provide the desired extra
voltage DC level. This type of circuit construction provides redundancy in
switching states which increases the multilevel inverter to provide high capability
during power usages. A k-level inverter will require a (k −1) main DC bus
capacitor and a (k −1)  (k −2)/2 auxiliary capacitor for each phase leg [5]. In
this work, a three-level ﬂying capacitor multilevel inverter is constructed with a
normal 2-level inverter, and a three-phase induction motor is driven with both
inverters. The motor is ﬁxed with J-type thermocouple at various parts of the
3-phase induction motor, and the temperature is recorded for a period of 4 h with a
500-g motor load. The power analyzer WT-500 is used to measure the harmonics
and total harmonic distortion. The motor is run with an input frequency of 9 Hz.

Normal or 2-Level Inverter (NID)
The normal or 2-level inverter circuit has six switches. Figure 1 shows the circuit
diagram of a three-phase 2-level inverter drive. Switches used in the circuit are
MOSFET’s (IRF 840); the control signals are provided to the IRF 840 by the
microcontroller 89S52 through an opto-isolator MCT2E. The keil micro Vision-3 is
used generate control signals, and it is programmed on to the microcontroller by
SPI programmer. The three phases in the inverter are 120° out of phase with each
other. The switch Sv is turned on with a phase delay of 120° form switch Su and
switch Sw is turned on with a lag 120° with respect to Sv. The switches can be
divided into upper and lower switches. The switches Su, Sv, and Sw are upper
switches, and Su′, Sv′, and Sw′ are lower switches. The lower switches—Su′, Sv′,
and Sw′ are complimentary with respect to their upper switches—Su, Sv, and Sw. In
same leg, both upper and lower switches should never turn on together; therefore, a
dead time of 100 is incorporated at the end of each control signal. The pattern in
which the switches are turned on is two switches from upper group are ON and one
switch from lower group is ON or two switches from lower group are ON and one
switch from upper group is ON. The result of this combination of control signal
produces a 3-phase output voltage which is used to drive the 3-phase induction
motor.

Flying Capacitor Multilevel Inverter (FCMI)
The 3-level ﬂying capacitor multilevel inverter has twelve switches. The circuit
diagram is as shown in Fig. 2 of a three-phase 3-level ﬂying capacitor inverter
drive. Switches used in the circuit are MOSFET’s (IRF-840); the control signals are
provided to the IRF-840 by the microcontroller 89S52 through an opto-isolator
MCT2E. The three phases in the inverter are 120° out of phase with each other. The
switch Sv2 is turned on with a phase delay of 120° form switch Su2 and switch Sw2
is turned on with a lag 120° with respect to Sv2. The switches Su1, Sv1, and Sw1 are
turned on with a delay of 20° in each phase with Su2, Sv2, and Sw2, respectively,
and the switches are ON for 140° duration. The switches Su2, Sv2, and Sw2 conduct
for duration of 170° instead of 180°; this delay is provided for the switches to turn
on or off without shorting the circuit in the same leg. The switches can be divided
into upper and lower switches. The switches Su1, Su2, Sv1, Sv2, Sw1, and Sw2 are
upper switches, and Su3, Su4, Sv3, Sv4, Sw3, and Sw4 are lower switches. The
lower switches—Su3, Su4, Sv3, Sv4, Sw3, and Sw4 are complimentary with respect
to their upper switches—Su2, Su1, Sv2, Sv1, Sw2, and Sw1. The pattern in which
the switches are turned on is two sets of switches from upper group are ON and one
set of switches from lower group is ON or two sets of switches from lower group
are ON and one set of switches from upper group is ON. The result of this com-
bination of control signal produces a 3-phase output voltage used to drive the
3-phase induction motor.

Results
The three-phase induction motor is inserted with J-type thermocouple at various
parts of the induction motor to monitor the temperature. The temperature is logged
on to computer using a temperature module kit. The total harmonic distortion
(THD) and harmonics are measured at the output of the both 2-level normal inverter
and 3-level FCMI drive using a power analyzer WT-500, and for a duration of 4 h,
the motor is run to record the temperature and harmonics at the output of the
inverter. Figures 3 and 4 show the temperature plot for duration of 4 h for which
the motor is run with normal inverter drive and FCMI drive, respectively. The
comparison of stator winding temperature for both the inverters is as shown in
Fig. 5. The comparison of the percentage of individual voltage harmonics of normal
inverter and FCMI is shown in Fig. 6, and in Fig. 7 also the individual current
harmonics are compared. The motor has been run for the speed 265 and 267 rpm,
respectively, for normal inverter and FCMI with 9-Hz input frequency for both
cases. The total harmonic distortion is shown in the Table 1. Fig. 8 shows the
output wave form of voltage and current for the normal inverter drive, and Fig. 9
shows vector graph of output voltage and current for normal inverter drive.
Figures 10 and 11 show the output voltage and current waveform and vector graph
for all three phases current and voltage with FCMI drive.

Conclusion
The three-phase normal inverter drive (NID) and ﬂying capacitor multilevel inverter
drive are constructed experimentally to study the temperature at the different parts
of three-phase induction motor. The harmonics and THD are also obtained at the
output of the inverter using power analyzer with input frequency of 9 Hz. The
harmonics and THD obtained for NID and FCMI is analyzed and compared; it is
found that the harmonics and harmonic distortion is less using FCMI drive, and also
the temperature analysis of the 3-phase induction motor is also studied and com-
pared with NID method; a less rate of rise of temperature rise in the induction motor
is found by using FCMI drive method. The most dominant harmonic in 3-phase is
ﬁfth harmonic; this harmonic is suppressed for both voltage and current harmonics
as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. Table 1 shows the total harmonics distortion of both
NID and FCMI. This study enumerates the effect of harmonics on the motor
temperature, and reduction of temperature is obtained by using a FCMI in place of
NID.

Anish Bhargav, Javed Ashraf and V.N. Ojha
Abstract In this paper, we present an indigenously developed automated mea-
surement setup comprising of three modules, using LabVIEW software in
CSIR-NPL. The ﬁrst module deals with differential measurements of any thin ﬁlms,
devices, elements, etc., under different magnetic ﬁeld environment. Differential
measurements provide analysis of individual slope of an I-V curve. The second is to
measure the I-V (current-voltage) characteristics of any element or devices. The
third module consists of a setup that can be used to measure the I-V characteristics
of thin ﬁlms, semiconductor devices, etc., from room to cryogenics temperature.
Some of the results obtained using these softwares had been reported in this paper.
Also the setup had been validated. The paper encourages the use of virtual
instrumentation for accurate and fast measurements.

Introduction
The automation has strengthen its root in the manufacturing industries, research and
defense laboratories, etc., due to its beauty of making the process faster, more
accurate, more productive, and so on. The advent of microcontrollers in 1971 by
Gary Boone and Michael Cochran provided a breakthrough in electronics
automation [1]. The research laboratories, industries, etc., all over the world are
using automation for providing solutions that are reliable, fast, etc. The present
work had been carried out in CSIR-NPL. CSIR-NPL is the National Measurement
Institute (NMI) of India, which maintains primary and secondary standards for most

of the physical quantities, such as voltage, resistance, time, force, temperature, etc.,
and also maintains SI units [2].
The current-voltage characteristics of a device or element represents the rela-
tionship between the current applied and voltage developed across the device or
vice versa. It gives an idea about the behavior of an element or device in electrical
circuit and also helps in determining basic parameters. In reference to supercon-
ductivity, it helps in determining the critical current of the superconductor. It is
generally speciﬁed in terms of a graph or curve in the datasheet of an
electrical/electronic component. On the other hand, differential measurements
provide analysis of individual slope of an I-V curve. The I-V curve shifts or exhibits
changes with applied magnetic ﬁeld [3].
The thin ﬁlms, elements, and electronic components made from different
materials exhibit dissimilar properties at different temperatures [4]. Therefore, it
becomes essential to monitor the behaviors of such elements at different controlled
temperatures. For example, Niobium, YBCO, etc., become superconductors at
cryogenic temperatures. Thus, we have developed a complete automation setup that
caters to these needs. The National Instruments LabVIEW (Laboratory Virtual
Instrument Engineering Workbench) software had been used to develop this
automation setup. It is generally based on graphical programming, where a VI
(Virtual Instrument) is created as per user requirement. A VI generally has three
components:
1. Front Panel: It acts as an interface to the user.
2. Block Diagram: The inputs and indicators that are placed in the front panel
appear in the form of terminals in the block diagram. The block diagram con-
tains structure and functions that perform operations as per the input applied and
passes the results to the indicator.
3. Connector Panel: It is used to represent the VI in the block diagrams of other
calling VI’s [5].
The automation or software control reduces error as it minimizes human
involvement, thereby resulting in high precise measurements. Using this software,
we had obtained differential characteristics, I-V characteristics, and temperature
controlled characteristics of thin ﬁlms, resistor, diodes, etc.

Measurement Techniques
2.1
Differential Measurements with Magnetic Field
Differential measurements provide an in-depth analysis of individual slopes of an I-
V curve. The software that had been developed here is based on Keithley’s four
wires, source current—measure voltage concept/technique [6]. Here, an alternating
current is added to a linear staircase current sweep. The values for this sweep can be
226
A. Bhargav et al.

deﬁned by the user. The differential current (dI) represents amplitude of the alter-
nating portion of current and is constant throughout the experiment. The voltage is
measured at each step of current. Then, the delta voltage between consecutive steps
is calculated. The differential voltage (dV) is calculated by averaging each delta
voltage with the previous delta voltage. The differential conductance (dG) is
obtained using dI/dV, whereas differential resistance is obtained using dV/dI. The
magnetic ﬁeld is applied to the sample under test by energizing the electromagnet
with the help of an electric current. The electromagnet used here had been devel-
oped at CSIR-NPL and calibrated at “Multiferroics and Magnetic standard” activity
of CSIR-NPL. It is traceable to primary magnetic standard “NMR Gaussmeter”
whereby one can apply desired amount of electric current to get a particular
magnetic ﬁeld. The software has the provision of applying desired electric current.
2.2
I-V Measurement
I-V measurement is based on the concept of sourcing the current and measuring
corresponding voltage across the sample under test. We had used current source and
voltmeter for this purpose. The current range can be deﬁned with the step value. At
each step of current, voltage is measured and the corresponding graph is plotted.
This technique is well suited for the elements or devices that follow Ohm’s law.
However, at nano level and cryogenics temperature, we perform differential
measurement.
2.3
Temperature Controlled I-V Measurement
Some samples/electronic components exhibit different properties at different tem-
peratures [4]. Hence, temperature controlled I-V software had been developed. The
measurement setup comprises of temperature controller, current source, voltmeter,
and a cartridge heater. The temperature controller uses PID control to reach the
desired temperature.

The sequences of events are as follows:
1. First, we enter the GPIB address of current source and SMU unit (source for
magnetic ﬁeld).
2. Then, we provide the start and stop current along with step size and delay
between each successive step of current. The differential current to be applied is
also deﬁned here.
3. Then, we provide the value of current for electromagnet (This current is deﬁned
using the calibrated curve whereby one can perform the measurements at the
magnetic ﬁeld he desires).
4. Finally, we specify the path and ﬁlename, to store the data in the form of excel
sheet.
5. The program is then executed and after reaching stop current, it terminates.

I-V Measurement
The front panel of I-V measurement software is shown in Fig. 2. In the developed
software, we need to enter the GPIB address of each instrument. Then, the inputs
are deﬁned, where we provide the starting current value and stop current value i.e.,
the range is deﬁned. Also step size is deﬁned. In the output section, we have the
current and the voltage indicators that show the actual current ﬂowing and voltage
being measured by the instruments. The current value and the corresponding
voltage value get stored in the table, and the I (Current) versus V (Voltage) graph is
displayed on the front panel. All these front panel sections are wired or programmed
in the block diagram.

resistance values of 500 X resistor at 0 Gauss and 104 Gauss magnetic ﬁeld. There
are no variations in the resistance values as desired.

conductance values obtained using software, we get desired resistance values,
thereby conﬁrming the reliability of this setup.
All the above measurements were carried out at room temperature. The readings
obtained in automatic as well as manual mode are almost identical.

tiometer is linear as desired.
The V-I curve of the diode obtained using the software developed is similar to
the curve provided in the datasheet supplied by the manufacturer. The above graph
also shows the curves for the readings taken in manual mode using same set of
input values and elements. The readings taken in manual mode are almost similar to
the readings taken in automatic mode, resulting in validation of the developed

Temperature Controlled I-V Measurement
The software is tested on Niobium thin ﬁlm at different temperatures. Graphs 8 and
9 show the I-V curve obtained at 175 K and 225 K, respectively, with and without
using software. From the curves, we conclude that the readings obtained in manual
and automatic modes are almost identical, thereby conﬁrming the reliability of this
software. The resistance of this thin ﬁlm at 175 K is 7 X approx. and at 225 K is
8.8 X approx. and is constant. We had obtained similar values using the developed
software. Table 1 shows the values obtained in manual and automatic mode.

Conclusion
The user-friendly automation setup for differential measurements, I-V characteristics,
and temperature controlled I-V measurements had been developed, tested, and suc-
cessfully applied for sample characterization. The software had been rigorously tested
on different resistors, diodes, pot, thin ﬁlms, etc. Differential measurements provided
an in-depth analysis of the I-V curves at different current range. For linear devices, we
got linear I-V curves, i.e., with increase in current there is a linear increase in the
voltage. For non-linear devices, we got the curve as desired. For temperature-
controlled I-V measurements, we obtained desired temperature with high accuracy
and stability, thereby conducting I-V measurements at different temperatures suc-
cessfully. The software control increases the precision and reduces the human error
besides resulting in the reduction of measurement time. Also, the setup had been
validated as the reading taken in manual mode matches with the readings obtained
using the software.

Design and Analysis of a Permanent
Magnet DC Motor
A. Senthil Kumar, T. Prasath Vijay Raj, A. Tharagesh
and V. Prasanna
Abstract Permanent magnet machines are widely used in many applications. The
structure of these machines is simple, and it is of low cost. Due to the advance in the
power electronic drives and circuits, the control of a PMDC motor is very easier.
Because of their excellent torque characteristics and good power factor maintain-
ability, PMDC machines are used extensively in artiﬁcial intelligence, aerospace
and military applications. Design methodologies are mainly due to armature
winding, stator magnets, poles, commutator, brushes which were carried out in an
efﬁcient manner in the mathematical form. This chapter presents the mathematical
model and analysis of PMDC motor, and it is validated using the simulation
software.

Introduction
The energy conversion device using permanent magnet as exciter can be termed as
a permanent magnet machine (PMDC machine). In industrial and automobile
applications, the PMDC machines play a major role in starters, wipers, blowers,
power window motors and toys. In space applications, these motors are used along
with encoders, decoders, and throttle actuators in a wide-bodied aeroplane which

could be operated without the pilots. The whole system is referred to be the ‘Smart
Actuators’. The PMDC motors for its least maintenance appear to be good for such
applications [1–4]. For designing the components in automobiles, high safety
measures should be taken, and so the design process needs to be more accurate [5].
These motor drives work efﬁciently, where the speed varies constantly and also
where the variable speed operations need to be achieved [6]. With the advent of
alnico (aluminium, nickel and cobalt alloys), the PMDC motor with high efﬁciency
could be designed. Samarium–cobalt made it possible to construct a small-sized,
lightweighted and high-efﬁciency PMDC motor [7].
The working of the PMDC machines is similar to the DC shunt motors except
the fact that the stator ﬁelds are replaced by the permanent magnets to provide a
necessary ﬂux by which the motor operate. Because of the less interaction of the
armature ﬁeld with the main ﬁeld, the motors experience a linear speed—torque
characteristics. If the torque increases, the speed will be decreasing proportionally
for a given armature voltage. Because of the permanent magnets, these motors do
not need separate excitation for the stator, and hence the size and cost of the motor
will also decrease effectively lesser than the conventional DC motors. By con-
trolling the armature, the speed of the motor could be controlled [8, 9].
PM motors are better in the ﬁeld of control, volume, cost, weight, size and shape
in comparison to its counterpart. They exhibit excellent acceleration and deceler-
ation. However, the major drawback is that the ﬁeld in the motor is permanent and
the air gap is limited and ﬁxed, and so the speed could not be controlled externally.
Therefore, the efﬁcient speed control is difﬁcult in this motor. The production cost
of these motors depends on (i) material cost, (ii) machine assembly cost, (iii) ma-
chine controller cost, (iv) operating cost and (v) emergency maintenance cost.
This paper presents the design and analysis of a PMDC motor. The modelling of
the motor was also performed, and the results were veriﬁed with the help of the
MAGNET software. Generally, the modelling is done to represent the mathematical
form of the mechanical and electrical system parameters [10]. PMDC machine
speciﬁcations: (1) output voltage = u (V), (2) output power = w (W), (3) rotational
speed = N (rpm), (4) type of duty = continuous, (5) type of construction = totally
enclosed.

Detailed design ﬂow, Sect. 4—Performance characteristics analysis, Sect. 5—
Simulation results, Sect. 6—Conclusion.

Mathematical Model of a PMDC Motor
The mathematical model could be achieved by relating the armature voltage and the
motor velocity. By this, the two balanced equations could be derived.

2.1
Electrical Characteristics
The equivalent circuit of a PMDC motor is shown in Fig. 1. The supply voltage and
the current are given.
The circuit consists of an induced voltage (Vi) in series with an armature resistor
(Rarm) and inductance (Larm). The rotation of the ﬂux generates the induced voltage.
It is also referred to as the Back emf.
According to the Kirchhoff’s voltage law,
Varm  VRarm  VLarm  Vi ¼ 0
ð1Þ
By Ohm’s law, the voltage across the resistor could be written as,
VRarm ¼ iarmRarm
ð2Þ
Similarly, the voltage across the inductor could be written as,
VLarm ¼ Larm
d
dt iarm
ð3Þ
The Back emf could be represented as,
Vi ¼ kvxarm
ð4Þ
where kv is a velocity constant derived by the permanent magnets, reluctance and
number of turns; xarm is an angular velocity of the armature.
Substituting the Eqs. (2)–(4) into Eq. (1) we get,

Mechanical Characteristics
The condition for the energy to be balanced is that the sum of the torques should be
equal to zero. Hence,
Te  Tx0  Tx  TL ¼ 0
ð6Þ
where Te is the electromagnetic torque, Tx0 is the rotational acceleration torque, Tx
is the torque due to the velocity of the rotor and TL is the mechanical load torque.
The electromagnetic torque Te with respect to the armature current is written as,
Te ¼ ktiarm
ð7Þ
Similarly, the rotational acceleration torque Tx0 can be represented as,
Tx0 ¼ J d
dt xarm
ð8Þ
where J is the inertia of rotor.
The torque associated with a rotor velocity is written as,
Tx ¼ Bxarm
ð9Þ
where B represents the damping coefﬁcient of the mechanical rotational system.
Substituting Eqs. (7)–(9) into Eq. (6) we get the following equation,
ktiarm  J d

Block Diagram with Transfer Function
The block diagram could be developed from the Eqs. (11) and (12). Taking Laplace

If the variation in steady-state values are considered, the initial conditions go to
zero, all values change with the reference state, and the equations could be repre-
sented as follows,

Hence, the block diagram could be represented for PMDC motor as shown in
Fig. 2.

This block diagram could be simpliﬁed by assuming the load torque is constant.
Further, the block diagram could be reduced and the overall transfer function
could be found, and it becomes as in Figs. 3 and 4.

Number of Slots Calculation
Usually, in 12 V machines, slot pitch (Ss) value lies between 5.5 and 6.5 mm.
No. of slots S = p  (D/Ss)
Taking Ss = 5.5 mm,
S ¼ p  53:8=5:5
ð
Þ;
S ¼ 31
Therefore, no. of slots should lie between 25 and 31.
No. of slots is taken as odd number to avoid the effect of harmonics.
So, the no. of slots can be 25, 27 and 29.
To reduce ﬂux pulsation,
Ratio of W  S/p = integer ± 0.5
For S = 25, W  S/p = 0.8875  25/6 = 3.69 (approx. = 4)
For S = 27, W  S/p = 0.8875  27/6 = 3.99 (approx. = 4)
For S = 29, W  S/p = 0.8875  29/6 = 4.28 (approx. = 4)
NO. OF SLOTS = 25

4.3
Type of Winding
Usually in case of low-current applications, the winding is assumed as wave
winding (Fig. 6).
So, for this application, wave winding is used.
Armature winding = wave, double-layer winding.
Double-layer winding is used for achieving higher torque.
4.4
Slot Width Calculation
(Tooth width + slot width) at slot root diameter = p  d/S = 3.14 * 39.8/25 =

Tooth width at slot root diameter should be at least 1.48 mm to avoid losses due to
saturation effect.

Brush Design
Maximum current density at lock condition in a brush should not be greater than
5 A/mm2
Lock current = 900 A
Since wave winding is used, no. of parallel path = 2
Current/brush = 900/2 = 450 A
Taking brush width as approx. 2 times segment width + mica width
Brush width = 3.45  2 = 6.9–7 mm
Area = 7X mm2
Current density = current/area = 450/7X
X = 450/35 = 13 mm
Height of brush = 13 mm
Brush width = 7 mm

Conclusion
This chapter presents an innovative design and analysis of PMDC motor. The
analytical model of a PMDC motor had been veriﬁed and validated using
MOTOR SOLVE MAGNET software. With the advent of rare-earth PM material
like samarium–cobalt, neodymium iron boron, the brushless PM motor, becomes
more efﬁcient than induction motor. The output power/volume ratio is high, and
better dynamic performance is available with this motor. Construction and main-
tenance of PMDC motor are also simple. Since the performance and control of this
PMDC motor are excellent, it makes the best choice in low-cost and highly efﬁcient
applications.

Abstract Simulation and measurement are essential to the process of designing
electronics. But they have differences in capabilities and limitation of making it
happen. This paper presents the detailed implementation of an electronic ballast, for
a ﬂuorescent lamp. The circuit is commutated smoothing circuit, power switch, and
driving circuit. It is a low-voltage starter, non-stroboscopic, has no noise, energy
efﬁcient, and has high power factor with very high switching speed. Characteristic
results and measurements are provided with comparison to market available ballast.
The circuit has been successfully applied to a 36 W lamp.

Introduction
The ﬂuorescent tube is essentially a low-pressure mercury discharge lamp. The
convenience and popularity of ﬂuorescent lamp is underscored by the fact that it
accounts for a great amount of light produced on our planet than any other light
source. It achieved its portion of dominance starting from the 1980s, and it is
estimated that today it accounts for about 80% of the artiﬁcial light used in the
world. It can be manufactured in almost any shape of white and colored versions.
The main disadvantage of ﬂuorescent lamp is their negative impedance char-
acteristics. So to connect the lamp directly to utility line, we need to prevent the
lamp from the excessive ﬂowing current and make sure they work in desired
operation region. For this purpose ballast are used. In ﬂuorescent light ﬁxtures, two

common types of ballast are electronic ballasts and magnetic ballasts. While
magnetic ballasts are simple and easy in their design and operating principle, the
more sophisticated electronic ballast just has too many advantages. In addition to
not causing ﬂuorescent ﬂicker and noise like magnetic ballasts, electronic ballasts
are preferred because they are smaller in size and weightless. They are also great for
the environment, and they are energy efﬁcient and help us reduce our monthly
energy bill. When we use ballast in ﬂuorescent lamps, there is an introduction of
harmonics in the line and that causes very poor power factor at input. So these line
current harmonics are required to be within standards. The international standards
IEC61000-3-2 and its European version EN61000-3-2 are followed for detailed
harmonic limits [1].
Important considerations for ballast include high power factor, low-total har-
monic distortions, low electromagnetic interference, and no ﬂickering. The elec-
tronic ballast has been designed to work for a 36 W ﬂuorescent lamp operating
from 220 V ± 10%, 50 Hz utility line. Switching frequency of the lamp is 25 kHz.

Circuit Description and Function of Components
The circuit diagram for the electronic ballast is shown in Fig. 1. The ﬂuorescent
lamps can be modeled as a resistive load because the converter operates at very high
frequency [2, 3]. The circuit is basically divided into four parts:
(a) Smoothing circuit: The VD1, VD2, VD3, and VD4 make up the smoothing
circuit of the bridge rectiﬁer that converts AC supply of input 230 V to pul-
sating DC. The output voltage from rectiﬁer will be ranging between zero and
ﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
times rms voltage. It will not work for analog circuit as it will have high
level of ripple superimposed on the output.
Fig. 1 Proposed electronic ballast circuit diagram
252
J. Lokesh et al.

To smooth the output from the rectiﬁer, reservoir capacitors C1 and C2 are
used. When the rectiﬁer voltage goes above the reservoir capacitor voltage, it
charges up and it provides the required current from stored charge when the
rectiﬁer voltage drops. Capacitors are placed in parallel with the bridge rectiﬁer.
It also helps in improving the power factor as the voltage level rises across the
capacitor and hence the power factor. The D1N4007 diodes are used in rectiﬁer
circuit and the capacitance in circuit can be found using the following equation
Rload  C  1=f
ð1Þ
where, Rload = the total resistance, C = capacitor value and f = ripple fre-
quency; will be double as full wave rectiﬁer is used. So we can ﬁnd C from
Eq. (1). Ripple is generally considered to be 1–20% of the input voltage. The
following waveform shows the ripple for a full wave rectiﬁer with capacitor
smoothing (Fig. 2).
(b) Snubber circuit: They are energy absorbing circuits that are used to protect the
circuit from overvoltage or rather absorb the voltage spikes caused by induc-
tance present in the circuit during switching. It is also used to limit the current
for the ﬂuorescent lamp to operate without any problems. In this circuit, R1 and
C3 are R-C components used.
The design procedure is [3]:
Assuming that the source has very less impedance, then the worst possible peak
current in circuit is given by:
IPK ¼ V0=RS
ð2Þ
where RS = snubber resistance, V0 = open circuit loop voltage.
The circuit dv/dt is determined from the following equation:
IP ¼ C dV
dT
ð3Þ
Substituting Eq. (2) in (3), we get
dV
dT ¼ V  C=RS
ð4Þ

253

By Ohms law, snubber resistance will be
R ¼ V0=I
ð5Þ
The amount of energy stored in the snubber capacitor is the amount of energy the
snubber resistance is to dissipate. It is recommended that to choose AC value
that causes the resistor to dissipate one half the wattage rating of resistance.
C ¼ P=ðf  ðV2ÞÞ
ð6Þ
(c) Power switch and driving circuit: Two MOSFETs VT1 and VT2 are used in
the circuit. They have very high switching speed and work in saturation and
cut-off states. Resistances R4 and R5 are put to protect the gate of MOSFETs
VT1 and VT2, respectively. Similarly in the case of source, for both the
MOSFETs, resistances are present. Diodes D5 and D6 are also used for pro-
tection of MOSFETs. Moreover, they connected in parallel to weaken the
memory effect of electric charge greatly between base electrode and emitter,
thus improve the switching speed.
The voltage transformer used is a triﬁlar toroid transformer. It plays a mutual
inductance coupling of signal role. It is wounded by single-stranded intersec-
tion of core wire and T1, T2, T3 at magnetic ring formation because the
intersection of driving circuit and the part to contact has very close interde-
pendence. So the relation between the intersection and the parameters used in
the process of production is relatively very difﬁcult to conﬁrm. T1 has 3 circles,
T2 has 3 circles, and T3 has 5 circles in this circuit. Electric capacitor C4 is
connected to VT2 base electrode and emitter, can prevent the base electrode
and the launch of sudden change of interpolar electric potential, and can protect
VT2 emitter to a certain extent. Capacitance C5 prevents the direct current volts
direct access to the ﬂuorescent tube and allows high-frequency alternating
current voltage of 25 kHz to pass.
(d) Series resonance circuit: Choke coil L, electric capacitor C6 make up the
series resonance circuit. The brightness and working current of the ﬂuorescent
tube is thus controlled.

Testing
3.1
Evaluation of Total Luminous Flux
There are two ways to ﬁnd the total luminous ﬂux emitted by the lamp or luminaire.
(1) Using integrating sphere: If light is emitted uniformly, then the light output
emitted by the lamp or luminaire is given by:
254
J. Lokesh et al.

I ¼ ø
w
ð7Þ
where
I is the luminous intensity in a particular direction (luminous ﬂux per solid
angle),
U is the luminous ﬂux in Lumens (lm), and
x is the solid angle in steradians (sr).
(2) Using goniophotometer (BZ method). In the zonal method, the light source is
assumed as point source and tested under standard test conditions. The following
equations are used to ﬁnd the total light emitted by the lamp. The following
equation is used to ﬁnd the luminous ﬂux between the angle h1 and h2
ø ¼ Imid  ZF
ð8Þ
where
ø is the luminous ﬂux.
Imid is the average intensity within the zone.
ZF is zonal factor, and ZF is calculated using following equation:
ZF ¼ 2  p  ðcosðn  1Þa cos naÞ Steradians:
ð9Þ
where n is zone number and a is zone angle (angular width).
The accuracy of the value increases as the number of zones increases with
decrease in zone angle. The proposed system is tested using goniophotometer, and
results are shown in Tables 1 and 2.
3.2
Reference Ballast
As per Indian standards, reference ballast always operates at 50 Hz line frequency.
They have constant impedance for long periods of time over a wide range of
operating current and are relatively taken care against temperature or magnetic
surroundings since the characteristics of any of the magnetic components will get
affected by them.

Reference ballasts are designed and manufactured speciﬁcally to provide stable
reference conditions for testing ballasts and lamps ANSI also recommended a
standard (ANSI C82.3-1983) for reference ballasts to check the performance
characteristics such as ballast factor (BF) and rated light output of ballast with FTL.
They are different from commercially available magnetic and electronic ballasts
such as those discussed in this report. The performance characteristics of proposed
system are measured in terms of ballast factor and ballast efﬁcacy factor (BEF). BF
and BEF is given by:

The proposed system is designed for 36 W FTL and the speciﬁcations are

luminous ﬂux with different ballast is obtained and shown in Table 1. The BF and
BEF is calculated using above-mentioned equations and listed in Table 2.

Conclusion and Future Scope of the Work
This report proposes an electronic ballast topology with very fast switching for
ﬂuorescent lamp. There is no ﬂicker at high frequencies. This circuit presents
simplicity of control, allowing use of reduced number of components when com-
pared to other topologies, for a given input voltage. Reduction in memory effect by
the use of diodes plays a vital role in increasing switching speed. Photometric test
has been performed to compare proposed ballast with market available ballast and
ﬁnd the characteristics. Presented ballast circuit has better ballast factor than the
market available ballast. It was applied successfully to a ﬂuorescent tube of 36 W
with very little losses.
We can also add dimming feature in ballast as it can save tremendous amount of
energy and also is an attractive feature that provides mood and brightness effect.
A 4 wire ballast uses a hot (non-dim) and a neutral (ground) plus two voltage
conductors for 0–10 vdc control or DALI control protocols. This can further be

extended by using a wireless network to control ﬂuorescent tubes to entire area
from one place. If using a wireless network to control the ballast (DALI), we need
to take care of the security measures. As ﬂuorescent lamps are widely used at
airports, hospitals, and many public places, and if the system is compromised, it can
lead to security threats.

Ballistocardiogram Signal Denoising Using
Independent Component Analysis
B.M. Manjula and Chirag sharma
Abstract Ballistocardiogram (BCG) signal provides measurement of body’s
reaction force for cardiac blood ejection. BCG signal acquisition and processing
techniques have attracted researchers due to its huge applications in biomedical
ﬁeld. These techniques comprise of detection of BCG signals which includes
weighing scales, chairs, tables, or beds. There are various signal acquisition pro-
cesses present, i.e., EEG, fMRI, etc. In last decade, simultaneous recording to EEG
and fMRI signal has grown as promising technique in this ﬁeld of biomedical where
brain monitoring or other physical activities need to be monitored. During signal
acquisition, original signal gets corrupted due to various conditions which affect the
signal. This unwanted signal causes artifact in the original signal, which makes
difﬁcult for researchers to analyze and monitor the activities. In order to address
this, we propose independent component analysis-based approach for artifact
removal. Proposed approach is implemented using MATLAB tool, and experi-
mental study is carried out for various user ‘data’set. Outcomes of the ﬁltering
method show better ﬁltering or denoising performance.

Introduction
During last decade, biomedical research has grown tremendously for developing
various noninvasive techniques which allows us to study about brain functionality
and neural activity, in depth. In biomedical electroencephalogram (EEG) and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the promising techniques to provide better

understanding of brain structure and study of brain activity. In later years, EEG and
fMRI are combined which is used for electrophysiological information extraction
and study of hemodynamic changes which occur in brain [1]. EEG signals provide
neural activity of brain with a spatiotemporal resolution which is generated in brain
structure by considering centimeter and millisecond order [2]. On the other hand,
functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) depends on blood oxygen variation and
neural activity, and using this also spatiotemporal information can be extracted with
the same order as EEG i.e., with the millimeter and seconds order [3].
In today’s scenario of biomedical applications, simultaneous recording of EEG
and fMRI is used widely for monitoring brain activities such as epileptic spikes [4],
evoked potentials [5], and sleep spindles [6]. EEG ‘data’ acquisition is performed
during MR imaging; due to MR imaging some artifacts are induced into the original
EEG ‘data’ which are mainly classiﬁed into two categories: (1) ballistocardiogram
(BCG) artifact [7] and (2) imaging artifact [8]. BCG artifacts are caused due to
subject’s head movement, motion of EEG electrodes, whereas imaging artifacts are
caused due to rapid variations in magnetic ﬁeld. Amplitude and timings are the
main components to characterize imaging artifacts. Key features of these artifacts
are predictability and regularity which are useful for artifact removal from recorded
EEG and fMRI signal. By considering this, various approaches have been proposed
in [9–11]. In [9], Allen et al. discussed about the artifacts present in EEG signal and
proposed a new recording system for artifact removal.
Similarly, during continuous acquisition of EEG with functional MRI, ballis-
tocarigraphic (BCG) artifacts are induced in the original signals. As we have dis-
cussed earlier these signals are generated due to head or electrode movements
during acquisition and due to electromagnetic states of the user in MRI Scanner In
the last decade, various methods have been proposed to address the issues and
complexities of ballitsocarigraphic (BCG) artifact. Ferdowsi et al. [12] developed a
new approach for BCG artifact removal by applying source extraction method. This
method uses semi-blind source extraction process followed by linear prediction
method by considering temporal structures of signal and uses previous information
of ‘data’ for predicting long-term data. Most promising approaches in this ﬁeld are
known as independent component analysis (ICA) [13], “optimal basis sets” (OBSs)
[14], adaptive ﬁltering [15], etc. These methods are promising techniques to provide
better signal quality and reduced power for BCG signals, but these approaches
suffer from signal distortion which results in the signal reduction or distortion of the
informative signal for single trial of classiﬁcation scheme. It shows the better
performance if limited trials are provided by considering speciﬁc situations. In this
type of scenarios, single-trial classiﬁcation methods provide better performance due
to its nature as supervised approach and multivariate capacity which can perform
artifact removal for low SNR [16].
During past two decades, various studies have been carried out related to car-
diovascular diseases by using BCG signal. These studies show the importance of
BCG signal processing approach. Various minor changes occur during BCG signal
processing which make it complex and cannot be measured by using these algorithms.
In order to address this issue, bed-or-table-based measurement systems were
260

developed for measuring the reaction forces. However, these schemes are able to
provide better and accurate performance during measurement but main challenging
issue related to this was implementation cost and requirement of mechanical
procedures.
1.1
Issues and Challenges
In this section, we describe the various artifacts which are present in the signal.
Artifact signals are not achieved from brain activities, whereas due to acquisition
conditions, artifacts are induced in the original signal. Various causes are present
which are responsible for artifact in brain signals, such as electrode location, hairy
leather, and impedance of electrodes. Causes of artifacts are characterized as three
main categories: (1) baseline noise, (2) powerline noise, and (3) occurrences of
noise.
A. Baseline Noise
This noise causes artifact in the original signal due to poor contact of electrodes
which results in low-frequency type artifacts. Another reason of this issue is tem-
perature variation of instruments and ampliﬁers.
B. Powerline Noise
Biological signals are corrupted due to interference of line, wire interference, and
other equipment which are used in signal acquisition. These kinds of noises are
responsible for spike generation in original signal.
C. Occurrences of noise
During the signal acquisition, if above-mentioned noises are not detected and
removed then it continues until the signal is acquired. This is called noise occur-
rences which makes biomedical signal processing more complex. Still there are
various issues present in this ﬁeld of biomedical signal processing which need to be
addressed.
In order to address these issues, here in this paper we present a new scheme for
BCG signal ﬁltering using independent component analysis-based approach.
According to proposed approach, all activities are considered as mixture and spa-
tially stable.
Rest of the manuscript is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, proposed model is
discussed, Sect. 3 describes outcomes of proposed model, and ﬁnally manuscript is
concluded in Sect. 4.

Proposed Model
In this section, we describe proposed approach for BCG signal ﬁltering using
independent component analysis method. Proposed ICA scheme considers three
key components for signal ﬁltering or artifact removal: (i) It is assumed that all
activities are mixture and stable for spatial distribution, (ii) propagation delay for
source and electrode is considered negligible, and (iii) electrodes are not lesser than
sources.
Figure 1 shows the overall working ﬂow of the proposed model for BCG signal
ﬁltering using independent component analysis method. Initially, raw ‘data’ is
given input and Preprocessing steps are performed, such as designing the ﬁlter, data
ﬁltering, and high-pass ﬁltering implementation. By applying preprocessing steps,
noise is estimated. On this data, high-pass ﬁltering and ICA are applied which
provide ﬁltered output.
2.1
Independent Component Analysis
Independent component analysis approach was ﬁrst introduced by Jutten and
Herault in 1991. In this approach, m mixture in a linear form with m independent
components is considered which is given as
xi ¼ d1s1 þ d2s2. . . þ dmsm
ð1Þ
According to ICA model, it is assumed that signal mixture and its components are
random variables and these components and variables have zero mean. If zero mean
is not achieved then sample mean is subtracted for zero mean modelling. This
model is used in this work for BCG signal ﬁltering. Here according to ICA, it is
assumed that S signals are recorded simultaneously which are given as

These recorded signals are considered in the form of linear mixture such as

which includes artifacts and neural activities of the brain

ð4Þ
where unknown mixing weight matrix is denoted as M which contains information
about signals at each recording.
Once the ICA algorithm process is performed, temporal structure and compo-
nents are analyzed to extract the artifacts, and responsible components for artifacts
are estimated. After estimating the artifact responsible components, its values are
ﬁxed to zero which results in a component matrix by considering rejection of
artifactual sources. Using this, reconstructed signal can be represented as
bNðtÞ ¼ M d
IðtÞ
ð5Þ
bNðtÞ is the artifact removed data.
In this proposed approach, we measure spectral and partial coherence of the
input signal’s spectrum which provides the measurement of similarity between two
signals which are recorded or reconstructed at different stages of signal acquisition.
2.2
Spectral Coherence Computation
In this model, to measure the similarity between input signal and reconstructed
signal, spectral coherence is computed for the given signal. This provides nor-
malized cross-spectrum of input signal which can be denoted as
Ca;bðf Þ ¼
Fa;bðf Þ

ð6Þ
where Fa;bðf Þ ¼ FaF
bðf Þ.
If spectral coherence for the given signal for all frequencies is zero, then it can be
concluded that there is no interaction present between two signals; similarly if
Ca;bðf Þ

 ¼ 1, then a perfect linear relationship can be estimated between given
signals.

Computation of Partial Spectral Coherence
Another measurement parameter for given signal is computed in terms of partial
spectral coherence measurement which is measured by applying inverse compu-
tation to cross-spectra for the given signal.

Results and Discussion
This section provides discussion about simulation study for BCG signal ﬁltering.
Proposed approach is implemented using MATLAB 2013b tool.
3.1
Dataset Description
In proposed model, for performance analysis, dataset is obtained from Georgia
Institute of Technology Institutional Review Board. This dataset contains 17 users’
recordings where ten users are male subjects and seven are female subjects with the
age variation of 18–27 years and height variation of 160–180 cm with 60–70 kg
variation in weight.
For ‘data’ acquisition, subjects stand still for 60-s duration on baseline and force
plate measurement. After this, each subject was asked to perform stepping for
5 min.
For performance evaluation, we have considered 17 users’ recording data. For
simulation, sampling frequency, cutoff frequency, and other parameters are con-
sidered which are mentioned in Table 1.
According to proposed study, initially data is taken as input in raw signal format
which contains artifacts and noises in the signal. Our main aim is to remove artifacts
from the signal. In order to do this, raw BCG data is processed through proposed
model, where initially, second-order IIR ﬁlter is designed and data is ﬁltered for
further processing. This data is processed using high-pass ﬁltering method. After
achieving high-pass ﬁltered data, mean values of BCG data are removed. On this
data, independent component analysis is applied to achieve ﬁltered output using
deﬂation approach which processes signal in one-by-one manner.
Table 2 shows the performance of BCG signal ﬁltering by computing average
coherence, minimum coherence, and correlation. These measurements are carried

out by considering input noisy signal and output artifact removal signal. Coherence
shows the similarity between two signals, and here we achieve lesser coherence
values between two signals which show that the ﬁnal output signal is artifact
removal signal corresponding to average coherence. Similarly, another parameter
computed is correlation which also has same characteristics as coherence.
In Fig. 2, we show ﬁltering steps of BCG signal using proposed approach.
Figure 2a is the original signal or raw signal which is takes as input for ﬁltering
process. Further, IIR is applied on this data followed by ICA algorithm.
ICA algorithm provides independent components which are used for signal
ﬁltering, and Fig. 2d shows ﬁnal ﬁltered output.
A comparative graphical representation is given in Fig. 3 by considering raw
input ‘data’ and ﬁltered output data.

Conclusion
In this work, our main aim is to propose an efﬁcient technique for artifact removal
from the biomedical signal. To address this issue, here we propose independent
component analysis-based approach for signal ﬁltering. Proposed approach is
considered as threefold technique where all the activity signals are considered as the
mixture model which has constant or continuous spatial distribution, second, it is
assumed that the propagation delay between electrodes and source is negligible, and
ﬁnally, it is also assumed that electrodes are not lesser than number of sources. Raw
‘data is taken as input which is processed through Preprocessing stage of proposed
mode. In preprocessing stage, initially second-order IIR ﬁlter is designed and later
high-pass ﬁltering approach is applied which gives high-pass ﬁltered data. Using
this ‘data’, independent component approach is performed which provides

independent components of each signal, suing these components responsible source
is detected and removed which results in signal ﬁltering. Outcome of study shows
better ﬁltering performance for various test scenarios.

Sleep Stage Classiﬁcation Using
S-Transform-Based Spectral Energy
Feature
Ankita Mishra and Madhusmita Sahoo
Abstract In this paper, we have presented a novel approach to extract the features
of EEG signal from its S-transform, in order to classify human sleep disorder
accurately. The estimation of sleep disorder plays an important role in identifying
sleep stages. Correct predictions can aid doctors in the diagnosis and further
treatment. In this paper, features are extracted in both time and time-frequency
domain and classiﬁed using a various machine learning algorithm. The recorded
EEG datasets are divided into delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma sub-bands, and a
set of descriptive statistical features are attained from all the sub-bands in the time
domain. In the time-frequency domain, spectral energy features are extracted from
the S-transform. Finally, classiﬁcation is done using three different classiﬁers such
as ANN, KNN, and SVM. The extensive numerical simulation results illustrate that
the proposed method is providing more classiﬁcation accuracy.

Introduction
One major activity of the human brain is sleep. Any normal human being spends
around one-third of the life in sleeping. According to Rechtschaffen and Kales
(R&K), sleep is divided into three different stages: awake, rapid eye movement
(REM) sleep and Non-REM (NREM). This NREM sleep is separated into four
stages such as stage 1, 2, 3, and 4 [1]. So a total of ﬁve stages is encountered by
sleep. As the stage 1 and awake has almost same properties, this paper merges these
two stages as one. The sleep disorders can be detected by analyzing each stage of

sleep. Thus, the necessity of separating human sleep stages is the crucial part for
detection and medication of sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and
narcolepsy. As EEG signals are nonstationary in nature, their statistical properties
change with time, and hence, it is time averaged. So the estimations based on the
time domain features are inadequate to track changes, for examining nonstationary
and multicomponent signals. So time-frequency-based techniques are used which
surpass traditional techniques based on either time or frequency analysis. The main
aim of this paper is to extract essential features, beneﬁcial to improve the classi-
ﬁcation accuracy. The paper has been assembled as follows: in Sect. 2, a brief
discussion on ﬁltering and decomposition of EEG sleep signal into different stages.
Section 3 deals with basics of different machine learning algorithms. Section 4
deals with details regarding analysis and classiﬁcation of the signal in time domain.
Section 5 deals with a brief discussion on S-transform. Section 6 deals with the
proposed scheme. The simulation results and discussion have been presented in
Sect. 6, and this paper concludes in Sect. 7 with a direction toward the future work.

Decomposition of EEG Signal
The EEG dataset is downloaded directly through the Internet from the following
link http://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/sleep-edf for our study [1]. Out
of 30 recorded signals, 12 are healthy and 18 are non-healthy subjects. Each EEG
signal was actual 100,000 samples per second in the raw state. In our work, we have
taken 6000 samples. There are two subsets of dataset, namely SC and ST. SC*s
are taken as normal signals, whereas ST*s are taken as abnormal signals. The EEG
data were divided into epochs of 30 s and a total of 4700 epochs (350, 310, 2220,
510, 480, and 830 epochs from awake, S1, S2, S3, S4, and REM sleep stages,
respectively) selection based on Fpz-Cz channel. Typical EEG signals (one from
each sleep stage) are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 simulated on MATLAB R2010a.
The ﬁve frequency bands of each stage named as d, h, a, b, and c are extracted
and ﬁltered using IIR Butterworth band-pass ﬁlters. The bands were ﬁltered by
taking Butterworth band-pass ﬁlters in the order of ten, eleven, eight, and two for
alpha, beta, theta, delta, and gamma.

Machine Learning Algorithms
Machine learning algorithms normally learn from the training dataset, and once
learning is completed it performs co-relational tasks on test data. An artiﬁcial neural
network (ANN) is a learning algorithm. It is a group of interconnected neurons
where a weight is associated with each connection of same or different value. In the
process of classiﬁcation, the weights are modiﬁed for prediction of a correctly
labeled class of the input layer. In this work, we have taken 300 hidden layers and
270
Ankita Mishra and Madhusmita Sahoo

six output layers. K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) algorithm normally compares a set of
training samples with unknown test samples that are stored in an n-dimensional
space to measure the closeness of samples. In our work, 150 hidden layers are taken
and the Euclidean distance is assigned as 1.
The support vector machine (SVM) [2] is a binary classiﬁer, used to locate a
space known as separating hyperplane between the two classes. The nonlinear data
can be classiﬁed effectively using SVM as compared to any other machine learning
algorithm. Accuracy, sensitivity, and speciﬁcity are used as evaluation criterions for
computing the effectiveness of the algorithm.

Analysis and Classiﬁcation in Time Domain
For analyzing the EEG signal in time domain, basic statistical features such as
energy, entropy, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis are taken into account.
(a) Energy: The signal’s power at any period of time is represented by its energy,
which is given by:

(d) Skewness: It is the third moment of distribution of data.
(e) Kurtosis: It is the measure of the ‘tailedness’ of the probability distribution of a
real-valued random variable.
The above analytical parameters are computed for all the stages of EEG signals.
Here, three sets of training and testing datasets such as 80–20, 70–30, and 50–50%
which include normal and abnormal subject’s features are taken for classiﬁcation.
The simulated results for three different test percentages are presented in
Tables 1, 2, and 3. The accuracy is better in SVM, and if more data are used for
training, then also accuracy improves further.

Time-Frequency Analysis
The time-frequency depiction of the signal is used to represent the signal in both the
time and frequency domains simultaneously, so that we can track variation of
frequency components with respect to time [3]. This can be achieved either using
STFT or S-transform.
(a) STFT
At each instant of time to represent the spectral or frequency content of the signal,
short-time Fourier transform analysis is used. Basically, in STFT, the considered
wave form is sliced into a number of short portions/segments and analysis is carried
out using Fourier transform on each of the segments. The time-frequency resolution
in STFT is poor, because of ﬁxed width of the window [3].
(b) S-transform
Stockwell developed a time-frequency representation which merges the best fea-
tures of STFT and WT. It can be described as a frequency-dependent STFT or a
phase-corrected wavelet transform [4].
Let us say a time series H(t) is given, the local spectrum at time t = c can be
evaluated by multiplying h(t) with a Gaussian located at t = c. Hence, the
‘Stockwell transform’ is given by:

Here, the oscillatory exp. Kernel remains stationary in nature, while the time

and 4).

Proposed Scheme
In our proposed scheme instead of taking the generalized features, we have taken
some special features. These features are computed from its time-frequency matrix.
First, the S-transform of each stage is computed, and then energy matrix was
extracted. Energy matrix (E) was calculated using the following expression:

where M and N are the numbers of frequency and time indices, and S is the

[4]. Once the features are extracted, some of the data are used for training and
others are used for testing purpose using different learning algorithm [7]. Earlier,
the same approach has chosen the features were extracted from STFT matrix. From
Tables 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, we can visualize that the S-transform-based approach
provides the better result as compared to other approaches using any machine
learning algorithm (Figs. 5 and 6).

Conclusion
In this paper, statistical features and spectral features are calculated from EEG
signal to analyze sleep disorder by verifying each sleep stages. In our proposed
method, we have taken the spectral energy features for classiﬁcation. From the
extensive simulation, it is clear that our approach with SVM gives the highest
accuracy that is 93% as compared to any other method. In future, the result can be
improved further if modiﬁed S-transform will be considered.

in Nakagami-m Channel
Samarendra Nath Sur, Susmita Prasad, Rabindranath Bera
and Bansibadan Maji
Abstract Multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) system is proven to be the
key technology for future generation communication system. Latest trend in this
ﬁeld is massive (or large scale) MIMO system. But it comes with additional signal
processing complexity burden. Also from the point of view of signal restoration at
the receiver side, equalizer plays an important role. Therefore, design low-complex
receiver is utmost important. This paper deals with the performance analysis of
low-complex loop-reduction-based Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz (LLL) algorithm. The
performance has been analyzed based on the achievable capacity and bit error rate
(BER). As also its performance has been evaluated keeping linear receiver such as
zero forcing (ZF) and minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) as references.

performance, all are inferior to the maximum likelihood (ML) detection [2]. But
because of the implementation complexity of the ML detector is not used in
piratical scenario [3]. In order to reduce the complexity, QR decomposition algo-
rithm is proposed. From the point of view of recent development of MIMO,
low-complex receiver system is required [4].
To support the growing demand of high data rate seeking application, large
MIMO or massive MIMO is the key technology. Hardware realization of large
MIMO is a challenging task due to enormous increase in the complexity of MIMO
receiver. Lattice-reduction-aided detection is a favorable approach [5–9], in the
context of large MIMO systems. This algorithm utilizes the near orthogonal matrix
to improve the BER performance of the system. The widely used lattice-reduction
algorithm is called the LLL algorithm [10, 11].
The LLL algorithm-based improved MIMO detectors are utilized and with less
complexity in comparison to linear equalizers (LE). However, the LLL algorithm
consists of many checking operations, which increase the computations time [12].
Therefore, to encounter this problem a look-ahead check technique has been pro-
posed to avoid the unnecessary complexity [10]. This technique is known as
loop-reduction LLL algorithm (LRLLL). This algorithm can be applied to real- and
complex-value LLL algorithm [12, 13]. However, in this paper, complex-valued
LLL algorithm has been used.
This paper includes the performance study of LRLLL-aided MIMO in presence
of Nakagami-m channel. Aim of this paper is to analyze performance improvement
of the LRLLL-aided ZF and LRLLL-aided MMSE detectors.
The remaining paper is presented as follows: Section 2 represents mathematical
formulation MIMO system. While Sect. 3 represents the loop-reduction-aided LLL
algorithm. Section 4 represents the comparative results to evaluate the performance.
Sect. 4 provides the conclusion remarks.

System Description
We consider MIMO system with NT transmit and NR receive antennas. The
received signal y can be described by:
y ¼ Hx þ n
ð1Þ
where the transmit symbols vector is represented by x, and n is the NR  1 additive
white Gaussian noise vector. The vector H is a NR  NT complex matrix, repre-
senting the channels for the wireless transmission. Here, quadrature phase shift
keying (QPSK) modulation is used. As a wireless channel, Nakagami-m channel
model is considered.

Typically, H is QR decomposed into two parts as H = QR, where Q and
R denote unitary and upper triangular matrix of dimension NR  NT, respectively.
At the receiver, equalizers are used to estimate the transmitted symbols ^x. In case
of a zero forcing (ZF) [15], the estimated symbols may be represented by
^x ¼ ðHTHÞ1HTy
ð7Þ
And on the other hand for MMSE [15] receiver, the estimated symbols may be
represented by:
^x ¼ PdðPdHHH þ r2
n IÞ1HHY
where Pd is the transmitted data power, and r2
n is the noise power at the receiver.
As stated in introduction section, lattice-reduction-aided receiver is more efﬁ-
cient in comparison to linear receiver. Aim of the lattice-reduction techniques is to
make the channel matrix H more orthogonal in nature. And this leads to better BER
performance. This technique ﬁrst operated on H to produce reduced channel matrix
eH ¼ HT. The matrix, T, is unimodular. The mathematical model then can be
rewritten as:
y ¼ HT T1x


þ n ¼ eHz þ n
Then, the next process is to estimate z with the help of linear receiver such as ZF
and MMSE.

of
LRLLL-concatenated ZF/MMSE receiver with conventional ZF and MMSE
receiver with the variation in Nakagami fading parameter m and correlation coef-
ﬁcient. As in Fig. 1, with increase in m value the BER performance of the system
gets better. At the same time, as in Fig. 2, increase in correlation coefﬁcient
degrades the system performance. As represented in Fig. 1, for m = 5.0, the
required SNR to achieve a BER of 10−2 for all the systems is 25 dB (ZF), 21 dB
(MMSE), 15 dB (LRLLL-ZF), and 14 dB (LRLLL-MMSE). Therefore, it is clear
that there is signiﬁcant amount of SNR improvement in case of LRLLL-aided
system.

Figure 3 shows a comparison between MMSE and LRLLL-MMSE receiver with
the change in correlation coefﬁcient. For example, for uncorrelated channel, to have
BER of 10−3, the minimum required SNRs are 33 dB (MMSE) and 19 dB
(LRLLL-MMSE). Therefore, there is a SNR improvement of 14 dB.
And also out of above said three ﬁgures, one can conclude that LRLLL-MMSE
is the best receiver and LRLLL-aided receiver signiﬁcantly improves the system
performance.

receiver. It also shows that as we increase the m value the channel capacity is also

(LRLLL-MMSE) for all receivers system. Therefore, impact of LRLLL algorithm
on the channel capacity is also signiﬁcant.

formance analysis of lattice-reduction-aided MIMO receivers. From the simulated
results, it can be concluded that lattice-aided receiver systems are much more
suitable than the conventional linear receiver (ZF and MMSE). Out of all the
receiver systems, LRLLL-MMSE receiver performs best under severe channel
condition.

Introduction
The neural network technology is the subdivision of artiﬁcial intelligence. And this
artiﬁcial intelligence has more sub divisions. For all those subdivision of AI, the
most important requirement is “machine learning”; there are different examples can
be made for machine learning concepts such as friend suggestion in the Facebook is
the best example; that application gives us suggestion on its own by relating our
contacts by analyzing by AI. There is another example is that the suggestion comes
in the Google when we type some words, the AI relates the general sentences which
can be made and it gives us suggestion, and this kind of actions saves our time and
makes our task more smarter way [1]. The current approach in neural network is the
object recognition, which makes the machine learning methods as essential [2]. But

still, there is a problem of over ﬁtting. The recognition of the pattern can be solved
with the size of thousand images if those images are augmented with the technology
called label-preserving transformations. By this technique, almost the recognition
reached to near about human performance. The over ﬁtting can be optimized by
data augmentation and dropout techniques [3]. In reality, the objects exhibit several
variations in it, so in order to recognize them, we need to use widely recognized
training tools as Pinto et al. [4]. The recent study says that it is possible to recognize
the datasets even with the millions of images using some standard tools (LabelMe)
[5] which has several thousands of segmented images and image net which has
more than 15 million high-resolution images under 20,000 categories. The tool
which is used in neural network should have the qualities such as scale, accuracy,
and diversity. The proper hierarchical structure of any tool can help to get unpar-
alleled ways in computer vision community [6]. To improve the present perfor-
mance in this ﬁeld ﬁrst one should know that the change can improve the present
scenario, deciding about the change which can improve the performance called
problem in fundamental credit assignment. The two main steps which are involved
in primary stage are: (i) the allotment of notation for event orientation to spread the
information in NN of networks and (ii) Measure of depth of credit assignment to a
path and their problems. The results of both the steps meet at a point to make the
output where the image processing can be applied and carried out for the further
process to get more advanced and better and smarter solution [7]. After the machine
learning, the next technology comes into picture which gives the support to the
machine learning and makes the AI smarter is image processing. The human visual
system is one of the wonders of the human evolution. It can perform highly
complex day-to-day task with utmost ease. Image processing is one of those dif-
ﬁcult endeavors. While human brain can easily compute such task, it is highly
difﬁcult to accomplish such a problem via computer program. This task will
obviously be daunting for a simple computer program, but if we approach this
problem by neural networks, this problem can be fairly easy to handle.
2
Neural Networks
What is neural network? And what is the idea behind this? The idea is that the
neural network is utilised to develop a system which can mimic the human brain.
A neural network, thus, is made up of small functional units called neurons. These
neurons are nothing but simple mathematical functions, which behave in the same
way a biological neuron does. These neurons are interconnected to form layers, and
these layers are interconnected to form a whole network. Simple neural networks
may contain 3–4 layers but today’s highly complex neural networks contain up to
thousands of layers which are used for all sorts of pattern recognition, image
processing, and what not. Let us begin by discussing types of neurons. Basically,
there are 2 types of neurons: (a) Perceptron and (b) Sigmoid.
288
Ambikapathy and A.V. Singh

(a) Perceptron:
A perceptron takes several binary inputs to produce a single binary output.
Figure 1 shows the representation of perceptron which has three inputs, namely
x1, x2, and x3, but in actual practice, it can have more than three or less than the
three inputs. Then, it comes to the concept of weights. Weights represent the
importance of input to the output. If an input signal has more weight, then it is more
important in determining the output. Generally, the neuron’s output is either zero or
one, and it is determined by P
j wjxj, and in this case, it may be greater value
otherwise lesser value as threshold value. It is same like weights, threshold value is
generally a real value, and moreover, it is a variable of the neuron. To put it in more
precise algebraic terms:
Output ¼
0
if
P
j
wjxj  threshold
1

P

wjxj [ threshold

<
:
ð1Þ
We make notational changes to the expression “P
j wjxj” and convert it to
“w  x”.
Where w = weight vector and x = input vector (Fig. 2).
Now, we replace the −ve of threshold value by bias, where bias point represents
the strength of a neuron how strongly it is being ﬁtted.
A bias represents the ﬁring strength of a neuron, which means higher the
value of bias, more easy it is for the neuron to respond to a signal and vice
versa. The values of these weights and biases determine the overall response of the

network. To get the best response, a neural network uses certain learning algo-
rithms to automatically tune the values of these weights and biases. This tuning is
initiated in response to external stimulation. The perceptron algorithm of perceptron
was invented by Frank Rosenblatt in the year of 1957 at the place of Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory [8]; this research sponsor is done by the United States
Ofﬁce of Naval Research [9]. The perceptron assumed to be a machine, instead of
assuming as a program; it was created and implemented in the hardware, and its
name is custom-built hardware, and it is named as “Mark 1 perceptron.” This
machine was created generally to recognize the images of array of 400 photocells,
connected to the “neurons.” The different weights are fed or encoded through
potentiometers, and weight updates at the time of learning were done by using
electric motors [10].
(b) Sigmoid neuron:
The problem with perceptron neuron is that a little change in the input values to the
perceptron can have drastic effects in the output of the neural network or artiﬁcial
neural network. That is why perceptron neurons are not preferred for image
recognition. This problem can be solved by replacing the perceptron neuron by
sigmoid neuron. A sigmoid neuron also accepts inputs and produces an output but
instead of accepting input only in the digit form of 1s and 0s, it can accept inputs in
the digit form of both 1s and 0s. It produces output in the form of rðw  x þ bÞ,
where “r” is an activation function. An activation function is a function of weights
and biases which is in turn reason for producing an output. In case of a sigmoid
neuron, the activation function’s true form is [11]:
rðw  x þ bÞ ¼ 1= 1 þ exp 
X
j
wjxj  b
 
!
 
!
ð2Þ
Therefore, small changes in the weights and biases produce easily controllable
changes in the output.
The changes in the output are well approximated by the equation:
DO=P 
X dO=P
dWj
DWj þ
X dO=P
db Db
ð3Þ

Architecture of Neural Network
A neural network (NN) consists of input and output layers, and it has some hidden
layers as well. As the number of these hidden layers increases, the decision-making
capability of neural increases (Fig. 3).
290
Ambikapathy and A.V. Singh

There are two types of neural networks:
(a) Feed forward networks: Networks without loops. The information travels in
forward direction only. (b) Recurrent neural networks: Neural networks with
loops. We must deﬁne certain algorithms by the help of which our network can
approximate the value of weights and biases. A learning algorithm basically
tries to constantly reﬁne the value of weights and biases by trying to minimize a
cost function [12].

So, our training algorithm does a good job if it can ﬁnd the values of weights and
biases for which the value of C(w, b)  0. To accomplish this task, an algorithm
called the gradient descent algorithm is used. The idea behind neural network is
to develop a system which can learn through some initial data called training data.
Gradient descent is one of powerful and most famous algorithms to perform
optimization. To understand the gradient descent algorithm, we will replace our
variables “w” and “b” with v1 and v2. We can understand the working of this
gradient descent algorithm by thinking of a ball rolling down the curve C which is a
function of v1 and v2 with Δv1 change in the direction v1 and Δv2 change in direction
v2. Then, change in C(v1, v2) is as follows:
DC  @C
@V1
DV1 þ @C
@V2
DV2
ð5Þ
We can imagine a ball which is rolling down the valley. So, we will have to
choose the value of v1 and v2 such that the value of ΔC decreases (so as to minimize
the cost function).

ΔC can also be written as the dot product of rC and Δv, where

ΔV can be written in terms of a variable called learning rate.

ð8Þ
This shows that DC will always decrease and that is what we want, to minimize
the cost function C. So, if the ball is moving downwards, then
V0 ! V  DV
ð9Þ
We will update the rules over and over again until we reach global minimum.
The learning rate should not be too small or too large. In case of large learning rate,
the cost function would not minimize easily by changing values of weights and
biases. In case of too small learning rate, the neural network will not learn fast
enough [13]. So, as the neural network learns, it constantly updates the rules of
weights and biases. Therefore, the new values of weights and biases according to
gradient descent rules are:
w0 ! w  g @C
@w
ð10Þ
b0 ! b  g @C
@b
ð11Þ
4
Stochastic Gradient Descent
If the training examples are very large in numbers, the learning rate is very slow.
So, to improve the learning rate, we can divide those training data into number of
batches of smaller data containing “m” training examples.

We keep picking up different batches of data until we have exhausted all the

Back Propagation Algorithm
This is a very popular algorithm used in neural networks to compute the results. It is
a common algorithm used for training the neural network. It works by computing
the derivatives @C

The weight also gets automatically tuned after the output from the layer prior to
the previous layer and the error from the previous layer gets multiplied. Thus, as we
have already calculated the derivatives in the 5th step, ﬁnally, the weights and
biases can be updated for the whole network [16].
6
Problem with the Quadratic Cost Function
If we initialize the weights and biases of a network and we obtain some initial
output from that initial value of weights and biases, and if the difference between
the initial output and desired output is large, the network learns very slowly. So,
to avoid the problem of this learning slowdown, we use another cost function called
the cross-entropy cost function. The cost entropy function looks like this:

ð18Þ
where

Softmax Neurons
Just like perceptron’s and sigmoid layer of neurons, there is another type of neurons
called softmax neurons which compute the output via softmax functions [17]:
al
j ¼

P
k ezkl
ð19Þ
The output from the softmax layer can be thought of as a probability distribution.
As we will see later in the results, we achieve a better classiﬁcation percentage
when we use cross-entropy cost function along with softmax layer of neurons than
using quadratic cost function along with sigmoid layer of neurons. Now, when we
train a neural network for classiﬁcation, we generally face some problems. One of
them is called over ﬁtting. Researchers are constantly trying to ﬁnd new techniques
to avoid over ﬁtting. Over ﬁtting is a phase when our neural network just mem-
orizes the outputs from training data and fails to generalize new situations and
therefore is not able to classify new objects (in this case). (a) Increasing the
number of training examples: if there will be a huge number of training examples,
our network will be able to learn more about the problem and thus will be able to
generalize new situations effectively. (b) Using validation data: We can divide our
294
Ambikapathy and A.V. Singh

data into training and validation data. It is a set of data through which our network
learns about some hyper parameters, e.g., learning rate and number of epochs to
train. This data set is used to verify whether any increase in the accuracy of the
training data is yielding any increase in the training data set. If it does not happen, it
means that our network is over ﬁtting. (c) Using regularization techniques:
Another technique to reduce over ﬁtting is to use regularization methods. There are
many types of regularization methods such as L1, L2, and dropout [18].

Use of Neural Networks in Classifying the Handwritten
Digits
This paper will use the concepts deﬁned earlier to classify handwritten digits. Such
networks are used by banks to read cheques and by post ofﬁces to read handwritten
addresses. Now, we will see the effect of different cost functions (those covered in
this paper), the various parameters of different values (such as rate of learning,
different number of epochs, and number of different hidden neurons) on the clas-
siﬁcation of accuracy of the neural network. The results have been obtained by
programming a neural network through python and the database on which we are
testing our network is called MNSIT database, maintained by the US Govt., which
contains thousands of scanned handwritten images. Let we use the stochastic
learning descent method. Let,
The number of training sample images = 60,000
Quadratic learning rate = 3.0
Number of hidden neurons = 30
Mini-batch size = 10
Classiﬁcation accuracy = 95.42%
But now, changing the cost function of the cross entropy, the classiﬁcation
accuracy becomes 95.49%. But, these times if we keep the cost function as quadratic
and change the number of neurons which are hidden to 100, the classiﬁcation of
accuracy increases up to 96.59%. We have not applied regularization yet. But if we
keep the number neurons which are hidden to be 100, keeping all the different
parameters same, but change the cost function to cross entropy, the classiﬁcation
accuracy goes up to 96.82%. Now, to test the idea of over ﬁtting (to see whether it
really exists or not), we reduce the number of training images to 1000 from 60,000
and keep all the other parameters same. As expected, we encounter the problem of
over ﬁtting i.e., our network failed to generalize new situations and our classiﬁcation
accuracy reduced to 82%. To tackle the problem, we increased the number of
training images to 50,000 and also applied regularization and found out that our
classiﬁcation accuracy increased to 87%. But, on top of that, if we train our network
on validation data, we see that the classiﬁcation accuracy increases to 97.92%. Now,

if we keep everything same and just change the number of epochs of training to 60,
we see that the classiﬁcation accuracy increases up to 98.02% [19, 20].

Conclusion
In this paper, we covered fundamental concepts regarding the neural networks and
deep learning and applied those concepts in classifying handwritten digits. The
choice of different parameters such as number of hidden layers, number epochs, and
rate of learning can be arbitrary according to the need of number of the network.
But the right choice can only be arrived at through trial and error and after some
experience. Till now, there is no set method to derive the exact learning rate, the
exact number of hidden layers etc.

Error Rate Analysis of Precoded-OSTBC
MIMO System Over Generalized-K
Fading Channel
Prabhat Thakur and Keerti Tiwari
Abstract The orthogonal space–time block codes (OSTBCs) increase the diversity
order of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system at a reasonable cost of
complexity. However, the precoding technique in which complete channel knowl-
edge is available at the base transceiver station has come into existence with OSTBC
for improving the system performance. Moreover, a composite generalized-K
channel model has become the key for analyzing both the effects of multipath fading
and shadowing. Therefore, this chapter has exploited the precoded OSTBC to
improve the bit error rate (BER) performance of MIMO system over a generalized-K
fading channel.

Introduction
The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a very rapidly growing technology
in the wireless communication systems. It has the potential advantages over the
single-input single-output (SISO) such as high data rate, low bit error rate (BER),
and enhanced signal-to-noise plus interference ratio (SINR) [1]. The MIMO is
exploited in the wireless communication by using three frameworks as follows:
(1) spatial multiplexing [2], (2) spatial diversity or antenna diversity [3], (3) and
beam-forming technique [4]. The use of spatial multiplexing enables us to achieve

higher data rates, whereas spatial diversity reduces
the BER.
Also, the
beam-forming increases the SINR signiﬁcantly with the help of smart antenna [5].
The spatial diversity is responsible for the reliable communication, i.e., low BER
and is possible at both transmitting (transmitter diversity [6]) and receiving ends
(receiver diversity [7]). Space–time block codes (STBCs) reduce the error rate of
MIMO systems by adding spatial diversity in various fading channel conditions.
The improved system performance is obtained by transmitting multiple replicas of
the same signal from all measured antennas. Thus, the probability of information
loss decays at an exponential rate. Then, the OSTBCs have been exploited for the
transmitter diversity in the wireless communication with known channel state
information (CSI) [8]. However, for real scenarios where CSI is not available at the
transmitter, precoded OSTBCs have been presented in the literature [9].
It is cumbersome to design OSTBCs for an arbitrary number of antenna with
complex ﬁeld modulation schemes. Also, multiuser detection at the receiving end in
MIMO systems is a prominent challenge. Therefore, to overcome the mentioned
limitations, precoding or pre-equalization techniques are used at the transmitting
end. The precoding is deﬁned as a process of exploiting the channel-side infor-
mation at transmitter (CSIT) on the signal before transmission [9].
A number of models have been proposed to consider the effects of fading and
shadowing in the wireless channels such as K [10], Weibull–gamma [11],
generalized-K [12–16], and extended generalized-K (EGK) [17, 18] fading.
However, the generalized-K fading model is receiving the attention due to its
ﬂexible modeling that has Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, and K fading as its special cases.
In [12], Shankar has proposed the concept of the generalized-K fading model. In
[19], the authors have designed a memoryless precoder to reduce exact symbol error
rate for OSTBCs MIMO communication systems by considering joint transmit–
receive correlation. The authors in [20] have presented a linear precoder by using
STBCs to minimize the upper bound of the pair-wise error probability. Further, it is
illustrated that designed precoder outperforms the preexisting approaches over
OSTBCs using Rician channels, especially for high co-related channels. The impact
of spatial modulation and precoding design on the SER in OSTBC MIMO systems
is illustrated in [21]. Moreover, it is reported that receiver-side correlation degrades
the SER, whereas transmit-side correlation improves the same at low-to-medium
SNR, and impact is almost negligible at high SNR. In [16], the authors have
examined the error exponent of generalized–K fading MIMO channels over
OSTBCs and have derived the mathematical expressions for Gallager’s random
coding and expurgated error. The performance of OSTBC MIMO systems over
generalized-K fading channels is presented in [15], and the analytical expressions
have also derived for the essential performance metrics such as SER, average
outage probability, and channel capacity. In [13], the authors have analyzed the
performance of multihop wireless links over generalized-K fading channels. Hendre
and Murugan [22] have presented a way to exploit the channel state information
(CSI) at the transmitter so that OSTBCs MIMO systems can use the precoding
techniques. In addition to this, a mathematical model for designing the codebook of
precoded OSTBCs has been provided to minimize the pairwise error probability.

Note that, precoded OSTBC gives improved error rate performance compared to
conventional OSTBC. To the best of our knowledge, error rate performance has not
been analyzed for precoded-OSTBC MIMO systems over a composite generalized-K
fading channel. Therefore, the same is analyzed in this chapter using binary phase
shift keying (BPSK) and quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation.
This chapter is organized as follows: Section 2 presents precoded-OSTBC
MIMO system and generalized-K fading distribution. Simulation results and
analysis of BER for proposed system are given in Sect. 3. Finally, the Sect. 4
concludes this chapter.

System and Channel Model
2.1
Precoded-OSTBC MIMO System
In [23], an approach of a codebook design shared by the transmitter and receiver is
recommended for reducing the feedback overhead by constricting the estimated CSI
at the receiver. The codebook contains a set of code words which represent channel
state conditions. This codebook is used in the precoded-OSTBC system analysis.
Consider a MIMO system which contains the NT transmit and NR receive
antennas with channel gains h 2 C1NT and space–time code C 2 CLT with length
L. The code word C is represented as
C ¼ c1 c2 c3 c4. . . cT
½

ð1Þ
where cq ¼ ½cq;1 cq;2 cq;3. . . cq;LT, q = 1, 2, 3, … T and value of L  NT.
The space–time code word C needs to multiply with precoding matrix P in the
precoded OSTBC. The precoding matrix P 2 CNTL is chosen from the codebook
with codebook size n (i.e., CB ¼ ½P1; P2; P3; . . . PnÞ in such a way to improve the
overall performance of the communication systems in terms of channel capacity or
error rate. If NT channels are assumed to be static over time period T, then received
signal r 2 C1T can be computed as
r ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Es
NT
r
hPC þ N
ð2Þ
where Es is the energy of the transmitted signal and S 2 CNTT.
Now the probability of code-word error in Eq. (2) can be calculated similarly as
in Eq. (12.3) of [23]. For a given channel h and precoding matrix P, the pair-wise
code error probability PrðCi ! CjjHÞ is considered and expressed as

N0, here, N0 is noise power spectral density and Ei;j denotes the error matrix
between the code words Ci and Cj for the particular OSTBC scheme. Now to reduce
the pair-wise code error probability, the factor HPEi;j in equation (3) needs to be
maximized. The H and Ei;j are not in our control due to random variations in the
channel condition. Therefore, we need to opt P in order to maximize the HWEi;j,

Equation (4) is a constrained optimization problem in which constrained on the

problem is presented in [9] by exploiting the concept of singular value decompo-
sition (SVD) of channel matrix H ¼ UhVH. In [9], it is reported that the leftmost

Simulation Results and Discussion
This chapter evaluates the BER performance of precoded-OSTBC MIMO system
for BPSK and QPSK with different fading and shadowing parameters. It is illus-
trated that for low values of k and m, the BER performance of the MIMO system is
worst; however, as the values of both k and m increase to 5, system performance is
improved. At low SNR, better performance can be achieved with high values of
k and m which is shown in Fig. 1. For k = 5, m = 1, high BER is achieved as
compared to k = 1, m = 5 which shows that shadowing gives more impact on BER
performance improvement. At k = 1, m = 70, BER of proposed system observes
Rayleigh fading scenario [23]. For all simulations, X ¼ 1 is taken into considera-
tion. The number of frames and number of packets are 1000 and 100, respectively.
According to [23, Table 12.1], the codebook generator produces the codebook
using the design process of (7) with NT ¼ 4; L ¼ 2; n ¼ 64, where L  NT. In
codebook design, channel gains are expected at the receiver side. Subsequently, the
index of the suitable code word is chosen to signify a state of expected channel
gain. Each index represents b bits and n ¼ 2b. BER performance of precoded-
OSTBC scheme is illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 for NT ¼ 2; NR ¼ 1. The
precoded-OSTBC scheme gives better performance than the conventional OSTBC
scheme without enhancing transmit power or spectral bandwidth.
The generalized-K fading channel is produced by the product of gamma random
variables and the channel matrix given for Nakagami-m fading with its independent
and identically distributed (iid) entries. Comparing Figs. 1 and 2, it is shown that by

increasing modulation order, better BER performance can be achieved. At 10−2
BER, BPSK gives approximately 3 dB performance improvement than QPSK. The
nature of BER curves for numerically chosen value of k and m for BPSK and QPSK
modulation techniques is similar.
Moreover, the error performance is improved at high SNR values with higher
modulation order. Simulation results are veriﬁed from [23] for a special case (i.e.,
Rayleigh fading) of composite generalized-K fading which shows that approxi-
mately 5 dB less SNR is required at 10−2 BER in precoded OSTBC compared to
conventional OSTBC MIMO system.

Conclusion
In this chapter, we have evaluated the performance of MIMO system with
precoded-OSTBC scheme in a composite fading scenario. It is concluded that
precoding enhances the system performance approximately 5 dB at 10−2 BER
compared to conventional OSTBC for a special case of generalized-K fading, i.e.,
Rayleigh fading. Moreover, it is also illustrated that the shadowing parameter has a
signiﬁcant effect on error rate performance. Further, this work can be extended with
spatial multiplexing and spatial modulation using precoding over a composite
fading channel.

lower power consumption and fast analog signal processing circuits. The
CCDDCCTA [2, 3] is a newly developed ABB. Its input block is CCDDCC
combined with transconductance ampliﬁer, which has high output impedance ports
for current and three high input impedance ports for voltage. The resistance and
transconductance are electronically tunable.
The study of various implemented sinusoidal oscillators [1, 4–9] using different
current conveyor blocks reveals that these circuits suffer from one or more of the
following weaknesses:
(a) No grounded passive components.
(b) Use of excessive passive components.
(c) Use of two or more ABBs.
(d) Non-availability of electronic tunability.
(e) Independent control of condition and frequency of oscillation.
A new CM and VM sinusoidal oscillator with a recently implemented
CCDDCCTA block with grounded passive elements has been proposed. The pre-
sented oscillator needs single CCDDCCTA, grounded capacitors, and resistor only.
The attributes of the presented oscillator can be electronically controlled by external
biased current of the CCDDCCTA without alteration of circuit topology.
Comparison with available oscillator circuits is also included. Simulation results are
included to validate the theory.

Abstract This paper discusses direct torque control (DTC) strategy for a syn-
chronous reluctance motor (SynRM). In this article, the SynRM is used to drive the
centrifugal pump that requires high power density. A mathematical model of
SynRM is formed using dynamic equations. This motor model is then simulated
using MATLAB Simulink. The suggested DTC control is analysed for different
speeds, and the results are illustrated. The control strategy is simulated, and its
performance parameters (ﬂux and current along direct and quadrature axes) are
analysed. Simulation results of the synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) and
pump are presented in this paper to determine the performance of the drive.

Introduction
The rotor structure of a synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) is robust and
simple [1]. They are capable of rotating at very higher speeds in hot climatic
conditions also, since there are no windings in the rotor [2, 3].
The
modelling
and
simulation
of
SynRM
are
carried
out
using
MATLAB/Simulink software. MATLAB consists of a variety of block sets and
toolboxes depending on requirements. For modelling the drive, Simulink provides
the necessary components. SynRM was created from the dynamic equations that
describe the motor [4]. The electrical parameters must be known for simulation of
any machine. These parameters can be either calculated or measured [5, 6].
In asynchronous motors, air-gap ﬂux induces the rotor currents. Whereas for
permanent magnet synchronous motor and synchronous reluctance motor, the rotor
currents are generated using permanent magnet or ﬁeld winding [7, 8].
Figure 1 shows the stator and rotor laminations of the synchronous reluctance
motor. Mutual ﬂux linkage along d-axis can be calculated using the following
equations:
bwmd ¼ kws1 Ns

p spl0^Bdd
ð1Þ

Calculating Ld and Lq for any rotor structure, the model of synchronous machine
can be treated as synchronous reluctance machine. Figure 2 shows the MATLAB
Simulink model of SynRM.

Modelling of Controller
In synchronous reluctance motors, rotor position has to be estimated because the
stator current vector and rotor position should be synchronized. Whereas‚ due to the
requirement of speed sensor that increases hardware cost‚ and reduces system
reliability‚ sensorless control of SynRM is gaining more focus by the researchers
nowadays.
In a SynRM, because the rotor follows the ﬂux, the position of rotor and ﬂuxes is
changed together. Therefore, in this method, the rotor position is estimated using
ﬂux linkage. Flux calculation using fundamental models to estimate angles is the
most straightforward approach and has several advantages.
In this approach, torque (Te), speed (xr) and ﬂux linkage phase angle (qs), in
both transient and steady states, are calculated by using the estimated ﬂux linkages
in stator (Ws). The equations of these calculations are shown as follows:

The DTC control algorithm for speed control of synchronous reluctance motor is

Simulation Results
Direct torque control was employed with the SynRM model using the parameters
given in Table 1, and the results were obtained as shown in Fig. 4.
The speed gets constant at 1750 rpm which is given as the reference value. The
ﬁnal torque is settling to 10 N m. At the beginning of the simulation, the motor is
unable to drive the pump load, and the torque ﬂuctuates between negative and
positive values. As we can see from Fig. 4, the torque settles when the speed gets
settled at 2.3 s. All the other output waveforms are pulsating in nature.
The acceleration and deceleration of a DTC control when load is kept constant
are shown in Fig. 5. As we can see from Fig. 5, ﬁrstly the speed is accelerated and
gets settled at the reference value of 1750 rpm. The motor torque is constant
throughout this time. The reference value is changed to −1750 rpm at 2 s. Because
of this, the speed is decelerated and ﬁnally gets settled at 4.5 s. During this period,
the torque ﬂuctuates as the rotor rotating direction is changed.
The stator ﬂux for DTC is given in Fig. 6. X-axis and y-axis represent the stator
ﬂux along direct and quadrature axis, respectively.
A centrifugal pump has been used to replace the load, and the output of the
pump is observed. The output waveforms of the pump are shown in Fig. 7. Before

opening of the valve, the speed should become constant. When the valve is partially
opened at 1 s, the valve ﬂow rate increases and the pressure is decreased. This
pattern is also observed when the valve is opened again at 2 s.
4
Conclusion
DTC is suitable for high-power applications due to its lesser switching frequency
simple control structure. It is concluded that the DTC exhibits a dynamic response
to the change in speed command of the synchronous reluctance motor. Also the
required control period is short in DTC. The response time in ﬂux and current is
very less, and the torque experiences very low ripple even during the acceleration
and deceleration of the motor. A major disadvantage of the conventional PI con-
troller is that it requires high response time that has been overcome by the suggested
DTC technique. Moreover, the switching frequency of DTC is variable.

Modeling of Controller
The vector control strategy based on one fact that on the basis of rotor position, we
are going to apply voltage vector. This principle is useful for all the drives that exist
today. Obtaining the rotor position is not an easy task as it requires sensor to detect
rotor position. Sensors have two main shortcomings. It is disturbed by noise, and it
is costly.

The drive system must be efﬁcient in terms of cost and performance. To solve
these two problems, the two main transformation of power system is used: Park and
Clarke transforms. These transforms are very useful in implementing sensorless
drive system. The equation for torque can be written in the form:

of the valve, the speed should become constant. When the valve is partially opened
at 1 s, the valve ﬂow rate increases and the pressure is decreased. This pattern is
also observed when the valve is opened again at 2 s.
From the Fig. 6, the speed gets constant at 1750 rpm which is set as the ref-
erence value. The motor torque is not always positive in this case. The torque is
settling at a constant value of 10 Nm which is desired for any pumping applica-
tions. The torque ﬂuctuates till the speed gets constant. This is because the motor is
unable to drive the pump when the speed is low. As the losses, damping and
saturation are not considered in designing this model, so the ﬂuxes and the currents
are oscillating in nature. These results were also veriﬁed.
Figure 7 shows the stator ﬂux loci for FOC. The ﬂux is generated according to
voltage vector to run the rotor smoothly.

Conclusion
FOC is better in comparison to other control technique as it gives lower torque and
ﬂux ripple. It gives similar result to PMSM except lower power and torque density.
Its dynamic response is slow as voltage vectors are not easy to calculate when
SynRM is disturbed. FOC has higher complexity due to the fact that it uses Clarke
and Park transforms; also, it consists of ramp function with PI controller which
increases the speed of motor during starting to calculate torque. Position of rotor is
also important to calculate and apply required current. The SynRM shows similar
dynamic and transient as its predecessor. The major advantage that it offers is fewer
ripples as it has no armature circuit and permanent magnet which distort the stator

magnetic ﬁeld. On controlling with FOC, it reduces ripple. The losses are not
considered due to limitation of mathematical modeling. This model is simple but
useful in understanding SynRM performance while changing saliency ratio.

Introduction
Electricity has become signiﬁcant part of industry and modernized civilization. This
electricity must be provided to consumer at a speciﬁed voltage and frequency to
operate gadgets. Due to economic and easy transmission, distribution electricity
demand is increasing progressively. But due to restrictions on exhausting energy
sources, the efﬁcient use of nonexhausting sources is compulsory to achieve the
rising energy burden [1–4]. Sometimes to provide uninterrupted power supply in
inaccessible areas of country is problematic. Distributed power generation using
available nonconventional sources is best alternative for electriﬁcation of remote
areas [5–9]. The kinetic energy of ﬂowing water can be utilized for electricity
production in small tributary using small-scale hydroelectric power plants
(SS-HEPPs). A valuable task is worked out by the SS-HEPP in generation of
electricity and the growth of pastoral and remote areas in budding nation [10].
However, cavity among demand of electrical energy and generation is aggregating
daily due to increasing electriﬁcation and limitations of conventional energy
sources. This is increasing the burden on available generating stations. Furthermore,
load sharing is compulsory to do by disconnecting small village electricity from
grid for few minutes. Relying on small electric loads from distant vicinity on grid
supply can be reduced by making use of separate generation units using local
renewable resources [11]. Thus, extents having plenty of water storage can also be
engaged for SS-HEPP. The hydroelectric power has profuse but unused potential in
many region of the globe and can compose a major contribution to energy needs in
future [10, 11]. Such electrical power generation is already a ﬂourishing and pro-
ﬁcient veriﬁed technology, but need to improve controllability of this system [10].
Power plants parameters need to maintain in speciﬁc value to obtain the precise and
valuable routine[12]. Frequency can be upheld via rejecting the divergence between
load and generation demand while voltage magnitude is sustained by means of
control circuitry.
1.1
Traditional Frequency Control Methodology
of SS-HEPP
In SS-HEPP, the output frequency control mechanism is not in practice due to huge
expenditure [11]. In stand-alone SS-HEPP due to lack of storage provision, total
power is converted into electrical energy irrespective of overall requirement. Load
ﬂuctuations are suppressed with dump load which are usually resistive. Frequency

control of SS-HEPP system with dump load is depicted in Fig. 1; therefore, the
actual and dump load can be always continued to have same electric power [10].
The prime necessity of SS-HEPP is water for use of irrigation.
1.2
Construction of Proposed System
In this technique, the valve control mechanism is used to guard the quantity of inlet
supply to the SS-HEPP at penstock driven as shown in Fig. 2.
In this case, servo electrical machine is employed whose angular momentum is
maintained by controlling command. The advantages of servo electrical machine is
that it is well-suited with processor, linear characteristics, quick response, etc. [11].
In this anticipated method, servo electrical DC machine is operated for governing
the input supply ﬂow through penstock.
In many methods, for certain operating conditions only linear system is consid-
ered while designing the frequency controller. The electrical components have
nonlinear characteristics which result in the occurrence of uncertainties in few
parameters, and due to this, traditional controller’s routine gets changed and affected.
Hence, it is very important to plan a good controller which has strength against the
parameter variations, uncertainties, and outside turbulence. In this article, a
fuzzy-based PI controller is recommended for frequency control of SS-HEPP.

PI Controller and Fuzzy Logic-Based Controller
Proportional integral controller is used for nonlinear design of SS-HEPP as elab-
orated in Fig. 3 [12]. The model consists of following parts such as the proportional
integral (PI) controller, the dimension system, model of servo electric machine, and
rotary mechanical device. At various operating conditions, the performance of PI
controller is affected by system nonlinearity and parameter uncertainties [12], so it
is appropriate to utilize well-built control method in opposition to these nonlinearity
characteristics of the system.
2.1
Conventional Sliding Mode Controller
Sliding mode controller (SMC) is used in control strategy of variable structure
control. The key beneﬁts of the SMC are toughness against nonlinearity, external
turbulence, and fast active response. Also, this method is simple in design and
implementation [13]. In SMC, system state oscillates around sliding surface and
does not stay on it due to uncertainties in parameters and restriction of high
switching frequency. The oscillations caused in system are called as chattering [12–
15]. This occurrence of chattering is unwanted as it may raise the control behavior
and stimulate the high frequency [13–15]. SMC is providing a viable solution to
control nonlinear system range.
Consider a nonlinear system.

The control law is speciﬁed as,

by switch sign function as,
unðtÞ ¼ kðsÞsgnðsÞ
ð5Þ
where k(x) is switching factor, and it is particular more than utmost compared to
uncertainty as s_s\0. The main complexity in this traditional SMC is unwanted
chattering in response to system due to the irregular extent in size of kðxÞ [13]. In
fuzzy-SMC, chattering is eliminated and also enhanced the system response.
2.2
Fuzzy-SMC Design
When the system state is away from the sliding level, the switching factor kðxÞ must
be augmented in same amount to gain the appropriate response from SMC [13]. To
get rid of the chattering, it is proposed to substitute the sign function kðxÞsgnðsÞ in
control law with fuzzy function uf ¼ kfs tð Þufs tð Þ and the controller utilized is
identiﬁed as fuzzy-SMC, and Fig. 4 depicts the block diagram of the fuzzy-SMC.

Proposed Control Strategy Simulation Result
To examine the performance of proposed control and traditional control methods
simulations are carried at various operating parameters for frequency controlling
SS-HEPP.
The simulation model of SS-HEPP in which PI controller is used for the fre-
quency control is shown in Fig. 3. The response of the system for 0.1 pu change in
load using PI controller is shown in Fig. 6a. From the simulation model, the settling
time of the PI controller system response is observed to be 80 s with the peak
overshoot of 3.3. In Fig. 6b response of proposed system is shown. In proposed
control strategy, very smooth control signal is achieved as unwanted chattering is
removed. In response to proposed control system, the settling time and peak
overshoot are reduced to 6 s and 0.58, respectively.

Abstract Electrical energy is required to run everyday appliances. It is generated
by from conventional energy sources, which are exhaustible; therefore, the
importance of non-conventional energy sources is increasing by the hour. Wind
energy as an energy source is non-polluting and does not pose any threat to nature.
For utilizing this source of energy, it is imperative to ﬁnd suitable ways to harness
it. This paper involves simulation of a DFIG for wind energy applications its
investigation under different network fault conditions, both symmetrical and
asymmetrical. The simulation is carried out with the aid of Simulink toolbox in

Introduction
Wind energy due to its economics and policies, environmental beneﬁts, modularity,
scalability, relative ease of installation, mature technology, and penetration in
modern power systems [1–3] is the most preferred form of renewable energy. DFIG
is a preferred choice in high-power grid-connected wind energy conversion sys-
tems, due to the huge economic gains resulting from reduced sizes of power
converters and ﬁlters [4]. A DFIG is also capable of extracting best wind power for
extended wind speeds, reduced mechanical stresses, and four-quadrant operation
[5, 6]. It reduces the load stresses on different wind turbine parts, counting the base,
tower, and blades. When efﬁciency of the turbine is higher, longer life time, and
energy quality is improved to make these wind turbines inexpensively aggressive,
although the initial cost is high [7–9]. Wind power plants are relatively nonlinear
containing many uncertainties. The utility grid operators need to anticipate the
vulnerability of the grids [10], for regulating wind energy integration into the
electric grids. This article attempts to provide an overview on different fault issues
related to DFIG connected to the electric grid. In this article, Sect. 2 gives brief
overview of network faults effect on DFIG. Section 3 gives the dynamic equations
for the modeling of DFIG, and Sect. 4 discusses the DFIG convertors; Sect. 5
provides the numerical simulation results and discussion for response of DFIG to
different faults. Section 6 provides the conclusion of the paper. Figure 1 depicts the
grid-connected doubly fed induction generator (DFIG).

DFIG and Network Faults Types
All the network faults can be classiﬁed as symmetrical and asymmetrical faults.
Various studies show that the highest chances of occurrence, compared to other
types of faults, are for single-phase faults. DFIG enables power production at an
effective cost resulting in decreased cost and increased power production capability.
But, the DFIG systems are prone to unstable operating conditions during grid fault.
This is due to direct interconnection between the electric grid and its stator
terminals.

B2B Conﬁguration of DFIG
The B2B (back-to-back) converter consists of rotor-side converter (RSC) and
grid-side converter (GSC). These are voltage source converters that have a capacitor
connected at the DC-link acting as the DC-link voltage source. RSC controls the
generator speed, and GSC injects reactive power to the electric grid. Decoupled

power control is easily achieved by implementing vector control on the DFIG
power converters.
(A) Rotor-side converter (RSC)
Overall power conversion for the DFIG takes place here for regulation of active
and reactive power. Control of terminal voltages and power factor is also achieved
by exchange of reactive power with the electric grid. It is rated less due to which in
presence of a disturbance, large amount of currents cannot be safely handled.
Considering RSC acting as a current source, the DFIG response is determined by
network voltage and frequency; the speed of the rotor; and rotor currents. Under
fault conditions, large rotor over-currents persist due to large changes in source
voltage. This happens because of the delay associated with rotor voltage control and
RSC limitations, necessitating RSC protection.
(B) Grid-side converter (GSC)
It is mainly responsible for DC bus regulation. It is also capable of processing
active and reactive power. Depending on the operating conditions under faults,
source of concern could be torque and active power oscillations. It is also inﬂu-
enced by the requirements of network management.
5
Numerical Simulation Results
The fault analysis is carried for constant wind speed of 15 m/s for L-G fault and
L-L-G fault which are asymmetrical network faults along with three-phase fault
which comes under the category of symmetrical faults. The converters’ control can
be carried out by vector control, which would generate the required pulses for the
operation of the converters. The fault analysis is carried out with the aid of the Fault
block embedded in Simulink. The various faults, both symmetrical and asymmet-
rical, are implemented on the grid side, and the behavior of the various parameters
of the wind energy conversion system (WECS) is analyzed for different faults.
Figure 2 shows DC link voltage (VDc) response to the faults. Figure 3 represents
rotor speed (xr) response to the faults. Figure 4 depicts real power (P) response to
the faults. Figure 5 illustrates reactive power (Q) response to the faults.
Large disturbances lead to high fault currents in RSC, and DC bus voltage rises
rapidly. During the aforementioned faults, the converter becomes saturated leading
to increase in DC-link bus voltage. This is because the saturated converter absorbs
large amount of power. During the faults, the voltage dips resulting in decreased
grid voltage. This causes drop in power transfer capability of the GSC, and the
additional power cannot be evacuated to electric grid. This bonus power ﬁnds its
way into the DC-link capacitor leading to incessant growth in its voltage. As
observed from Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 5, highest ﬂuctuations occur at the beginning of the
fault. For three-phase fault, the magnitude of current can reach up to 3 p.u. nearly

every time. This may lead to damage of the converters’ semiconductor devices
unless a overrated converter is used. Under three-phase fault, leakage inductances
will be saturated due to an emf that causes rotor converter saturation. Under such
conditions, analyzing the DFIG behavior becomes complicated due to deviation
from the Superposition principle.

Conclusion
DFIG has an edge over other wind power generation technologies making them the
favorite choice. In this article, different fault issues related to grid-connected DFIG
have been simulated and an attempt is made to assess their severity for DFIG as in
order to attain increased wind power penetration in the electric grid. Under severe
faults, analyzing the DFIG behavior becomes complicated due to deviation from the
Superposition principle. Analysis of fault conditions is necessary as the future of
DFIG wind energy systems is to beneﬁt both utility systems and individual con-
sumers of energy in a safe and reliable manner to achieve optimum performance
and provide grid resiliency to power quality issues.

Abstract In this paper transfer function of a heat exchanger is implemented in
MATLAB and is controlled by a PID controller. The controller is implemented in
PLC (S7-1200). They both are interfaced using Arduino. The advantage of this
method is that without having the actual plant, its response can be studied if the
transfer function of a system is available. We have used Arduino Uno for inter-
facing PLC with MATLAB. The response of the system for three set points was
noted. This project also shows that even though Arduino can be used for inter-
facing, the maximum output voltage of 5 V becomes the limitations. Transfer
function of Heat exchanger is used in the recovery of soda in a paper pulp industry.

plant is stable or unstable, but the real response of the system cannot be known. We
can change the set point and see what happens in real time which is not usually
possible in MATLAB and Simulink packages. That will only be known when the
system is actually being controlled by a PID controller. Here, the MATLAB will
behave like an actual plant, and the controller will control the developed plant in
MATLAB in real time. So that we can analyze what actually is happening in
between the plant and the controller. In this way, we are developing a new method
to check the response of a real-time plant control without having the actual plant
with us. To make the plant to interact with the controller, we have to take an
interfacing device which will create the behavior of the plant inside it. The inter-
facing device can be controlled with PLC. To maintain a particular temperature in a
heat exchanger will be very difﬁcult, so we have implemented here a PID controller.
The controller will try to maintain the current temperature given by the user.
This PID logic can be implemented using the HMI which will use the human–
machine interface device and maintain the temperature according to the user. But as
a whole, the main thing will be done by PID controller implemented inside the
PLC. The controller will maintain the temperature without affecting the plant sta-
bility. The performance of the system is determined in terms of settling time, peak
time, and the percentage overshoot [1]. Generally, we use Ziegler–Nichols method
to study different response of the plant, but real-time auto-tuning method is more
effective compared to ofﬂine tuning like Ziegler–Nichols method This process of
ﬁne tuning provides some algebraic rules to tune the PID parameter. This tuning
method is deﬁned inside the PID controller which is designed by the S7-1200
manufacturer. The process is veriﬁed here as a real-time implementation. In this
process, we can implement the stabilization for an nth order system also. Usually,
PID control done by using a dedicated test signal, but a real-time plant response is
taken as input to the PID controller in this paper [2].
Here the PID controller is discretization PID controller it will be more interactive
with the process that we are implementing in. Here, also the sampling time taken as
0.5 and 0.3 s for observations. The PID controller [3] will add one pole or zero
according to the plant model and make the system stable. It is more important that
the plant properties should not be affected with the help of the implementation of
PID controller, so real-time implementation plays an important role in this case [4–
6]. There are variety of control schemes such as internal model predictive control,
smith predictor control, dynamic matrix control, and cascade control; all these
schemes of control system use PID controller as their main control part so if the PID
control action will be online, then the desired control scheme can be implemented
in an effective way. This enables us to come out from simulation area to a real-time
implementation in laboratory [7].
Arduino Uno [8] is a microcontroller which is based on AT-mega 328P. It has 6
analog input pins, 14 digital input and output pins. Out of these, 14 pins and 6 pins
can be used as PWM (Pulse-Width Modulated) output pins. It uses 16 MHz quartz
crystal. It also has an ICSP (In-circuit Serial Programming) header and a button for
reset.

PLC contains three important parts; they are power supply, CPU, I/O modules
[8]. The I/O modules can be divided into analog and digital I/O’s. The PLC used in
our laboratory for the experiment is S7-1200 [9], and its processor is CPU 1214C. It
has 4 MB internal load memory (each data log ﬁle can contain maximum of
500 KB) and has 14 digital input ports and 10 digital output ports. It also has 2
analog input and 4 pulse output ports and uses Ethernet for communication pur-
pose. It has a math execution speed of 2.3 µs per instructions. Total integrated
automation (TIA V13) writes the program into the CPU [8]. Here, set point is taken
as digital signal and PWM techniques used for giving the output signal. The range
of input signal is usually 0–24 V, and the range of output signal is 0–12 V, which is
also matching the range of Arduino input voltage range, so interfacing both the
devices becomes easier. The selected heat exchanger is used in the recovery of soda
in a paper pulp industry. In paper industry, chemicals are used to separate cellulose
from wood and other substances used for the production of paper. After doing this
process, these chemicals have to be recovered for the economical operation of the
plant. So the resultant product is burned to produce heat, which is used to produce
steam and run the turbine to produce electricity.

Methodology
Here, the interfacing of MATLAB with PLC using Arduino Mega 2560 is shown in
Fig. 1. The plant model in MATLAB is burnt into Arduino [10]. The response of
the plant is taken and given to the PLC via its analog input port. The necessary
control action is taken by the PID implemented in the PLC is given back to Arduino
through its analog input ports. Figure 2 shows the transfer function implementation
in MATLAB through Arduino. Here, analog input block is used to read analog
input signals. The port numbers are speciﬁed as 0–5, and any one port can be
chosen to receive the signal from the PLC. Arduino can read 0–10 V in its input
port. Arduino converts the voltage into bit value; for example, it assigns 1024

(0011 1111 1111) for 10 V and 512 (0001 1111 1111) for 5 V. The calculation is
made (5/1024 is multiplied) to normalize this assigned value in the range of 0–5 V.
This voltage is given as input to the valve transfer function; its output is given to the
heat exchanger transfer function. The output from the heat exchanger transfer
function is taken by the sensor transfer function and given to the Arduino PWM
block. The sensor output is converted as duty cycle value by normalizing it and that
input is fed to the PWM block which is now determining the duty cycle of PWM.
For ex: if duty cycle of 127 PWM block gives 2.5 V, 255 PWM gives 5 V etc. Heat
Exchanger model [4] is implemented in MATLAB. The transfer function of heat
exchanger gives the relationship between ﬂow of steam entering into the heat
exchanger and the temperature of the ﬂuid coming out of the heat exchanger of the
other side which is given in Eq. (1). This process of steam inﬂow into the heat
exchanger is usually controlled by the valves. The transfer function of the valve is
given in Eq. (2). Now, PLC will control that valve through the appropriate PID
parameters which is converted as voltage. This voltage controls the valve which
regulates the steam ﬂow. The output side of heat exchanger temperature is fed to the
PID controller through the sensor whose transfer function is given in Eq (3).
Transfer function of heat exchanger [4] is given below:

The whole process is described in the steps given below:
• The plant, feedback sensor, and actuator transfer function is made available in
Simulink through the transfer function block. Arduino and MATLAB are
connected through the Arduino Simulink support package in MATLAB [9].
• The PLC is programmed by using TIA V13 software which drives the PLC
S7-1200.
• The PID controller is created in the PLC cyclic block.
• All the I/O ports which are needed for the PLC to communicate with Arduino
are deﬁned.
• MATLAB and Arduino are interfaced through the ports. The output signal is
pulse-width modulated (PWM), and it is given to the Arduino via its analog
input port.
3
Interfacing
The PID controller is designed in PLC software as given in Fig. 3. The PID con-
troller can only be implemented in the cyclic block present in PLC. As this is a
real-time implementation, the time constraints here are very important. PID is a
closed loop controller that is used in many processes to minimize the error value
and to achieve the desired set points. It has 3 control actions: proportional (P),
integral (I), and derivative (D).
Proportional produces a control action proportional to the present error value. It
is adjusted by varying the proportional gain constant. Integral produces a control
action that is proportional to the magnitude and duration of the error. It can be
varied by varying integral gain constant. It helps the system to reach the set point
faster. Derivative control improves the transient performance of the system. It
anticipates the error and produces the automatic control action accordingly. It can
be adjusted by varying the derivative gain constant. In heat exchanger to maintain
its temperature to the desired set point, PID controller is implemented through PLC.
The controller should react to the process within a stipulated time; otherwise, the
process cannot be controlled in the desired manner. In this way, our method is
different from other models. The online ﬁne tuning system given inside the PLC
was used for tuning the PID. There are two types of tuning system inside PLC out
of which ﬁne tuning mode was implemented. The sampling time was taken to be
0.001 s. By implementing the above mentioned methods, the PID control was
implemented in PLC. After tuning process is completed, the PID parameters are set
automatically which is shown in Fig. 4. The response is shown in Fig. 5 which also
gives the enlarge view of the reading.

Results and Conclusion
Figure 6 shows settling time of 2750 s with 45 °C set point. From the above
responses when the present temperature of the heat exchanger increases above the
set point, the control input is decreasing which implies that the actuator which is
controlling the valve will reduce the ﬂow of steam to the heat exchanger. As a result
the temperature starts decreasing. The reverse will happen when the present tem-
perature of the heat exchanger decreases below the set point. From Fig. 6, we infer
that the plant takes some time to settle to the set point. In Figs. 5 and 6, it is seen
that the control action and the temperature are varying rapidly, which is taken after
certain interval; it is seen that the temperature has settled to the set point. It is
observed that as input increases from the set point, the controller output decreases
proportionally and vice versa. It takes some time for the system to auto-tune itself.
Since Arduino is having the maximum possible output voltage of 5 V, the rating of
the output temperature of the ﬂow from the heat exchanger is restricted within the

the square wave in red color. The settling time here for the 45 °C temperature is

observed is 2025 s. When the system is ﬁrst started, it is taking some time to tune;
after the system is being tuned, the control action is being implemented, and the
system is ﬁnally being settled. After the settling time is reached, the temperature of
the heat exchange is reached to the desired set point means here the working ﬂuid is

Digitally Controlled Hybrid Liquid Level
Detection System Using Programmable
Logic Controller and Microcontroller
U.B. Kayande, P. Jaspreetkaur, R.M. Kulkarni, S.B. Mahajan
and P. Sanjeevikumar
Abstract In this paper, digitally controlled hybrid liquid level detection (HLLD)
system using programmable logic controller (PLC) and microcontroller is articu-
lated. In most of the industries, liquid (chemicals, paint, water, etc.,) is stored at
ground levels or in underground tanks and then pumped into overhead tanks as per
requirement. This method is advantageous because it is very easy to unload tanks of
liquid into underground tanks, and liquid can be pumped as per its necessity. PLC is
excellent industrial controller which is used for pump control along with its analog
module interfaced to sensor for level detection. This system is efﬁcient but very
costly because of analog module. Proposed system eliminates the analog module
and replaces it with an embedded microcontroller. In proposed system, PLC analog
module is replaced by Arduino microcontroller. This reduces cost of system very
much, even the sensors used with microcontroller are comparatively very cheap
than those used with PLC directly. In the proposed mechanism, supervisory control
and data acquisition (SCADA) system is also interfaced with PLC which monitors
the level of liquid and logs the data of liquid usage for analysis. This paper gives
detailed information of proposed system along with ﬂowcharts, algorithms, and
hardware implementation with actual result of SCADA system.

Introduction
Resource or raw material supervision is most crucial point in industrial manage-
ment. Liquid-state raw materials like water, oils, chemicals, paints are more difﬁcult
for managing than solids; hence it needs a well-supervised system of control for
preserving raw material before it gets processed. Not only controlling expenditure
of such materials is important but also measurement of units consumed is equally
essential. Wastage of such resources may affect industry in terms of economic loss
as well as energy loss [1–4]. In recent years, industries are replacing all the material
and resource handling techniques with fully self-governing systems which save
time, labor cost, and energy with minimum amount of error [1–3]. Extensive
research in area of automation already made industrial processes very fast, effective,
and accurate. Industrial automation systems mostly prefer programmable logic
controller (PLC) for controlling purpose which is very easy to operate and cost
effective over a period of time.
In most cases, liquid-type raw material is stored in large underground tanks as it
is easy to unload liquid in such type of storage. Then, this liquid is pumped as per
the requirement of process. The existing process is having disadvantage of liquid
unexploited due to overﬂow of the upper tanks, due to delay in turning off pump, to
avoid this disadvantage, PLC-based automation is implemented using analog
module by interfacing it to ultrasonic sensor [5–10]. Figure 1 depicts the block
diagram of conventional PLC control system for pumped liquid storage system.
The cost of such design is very high because analog modules and ultrasonic level
sensors are operating on the range of 0–24 V. By considering this drawback, new
mechanism is implemented in proposed system which overcomes the existing
disadvantage. In the suggested system, analog module of PLC is converted into

digital by using Arduino ATmega328 microcontroller which is having in build A to
D converter. The designed mechanism is also having additional feature to log liquid
dispatch which can explain expenditure of liquid by hours, day, week, month, or a
year [7–10].
Effective administrative level control of multiple tanks can be accomplished by
proposed system model. Two level sensors are used to deliver the level statistics to
the PLC through an auxiliary controller (embedded controller Arduino). PLC works
on these records to proceed the required decisions and thereby energizing and
de-energizing a drive. This system was implemented in SCADA to create the
required human–machine interface (HMI). Figure 2 depicts the block diagram of
proposed PLC control system for pumped liquid storage.

Connection Diagram of Proposed System
Connection diagram of proposed system is depicted in Fig. 3. Arduino is employed,
and it works as an interface between sensor and PLC instead of analog module. The
ultrasonic sensors are used with operating voltage of 5 V DC same as that of
Arduino. The sensors are interfaced with controller, and then output pins of con-
troller are connected to analog terminals of PLC. Ladder logic loaded in PLC will
operate relay (digital output) from the values of these two analog ports. The motor
driver circuit operates on the command of the relay. SCADA/HMI is also connected
with the PLC by the GUI. SCADA/HMI is used for continuous monitoring and
analysis of the water ﬂow in the tanks. Ethernet communication provides data
transfer from PLC to SCADA or vice versa; communication cable type may vary
with distance. Product required for design of proposed system is given in Table 1
with speciﬁcation.

can offer serial communication over USB and seems to be a simulated com port to
software on the computer. This 16U2 ﬁrmware customs the standard USB COM
drivers without commissioning the external driver. Figure 4 shows the ﬂowchart of
the sensor and Arduino interfacing program which can establish communication
between two sensors and Arduino. The maximum range of the sensor is used at the
respective analog value of 255 and minimum on 0, but practically it cannot be kept
at zero; hence it is kept at 35 which corresponds to minimum range of the sensor.
Quantities such as long duration, distance, and PWM correspond to sensor 1
reading, whereas duration 2, distance 2, and PWM 2 corresponds to sensor 2.
Sensor 1 and sensor 2 readings are then written on analog pins of Arduino which
are then given to PLC.

comparators. Pump can be controlled both manually as well as automatically
according to our demand. Separate relay is used for pumping motor. Figure depicts
the ladder logic designed for proposed system. The above ladder logic shows our
different values of both sensors which are calculated from Arduino output voltage
values and bits of arithmetic and logical unit (ALU) of PLC and controller. For tank
1, the values of sensor are max 14,300 and min 2600. For tank 2, the values of
sensor are max 13,400 and min 2300. The program is executive with the sequence.
(i) Firstly it will check whether the underground tank has sufﬁcient water present or
not after coming empty signal from overhead tank. The value for it is 9300, i.e.,
25%. (ii) If tank_2 < 100%, then pump will be on and tank_2 will ﬁll-up, same
time tank_1 decreases. (iii) If tank_2 full, then pump will be off. (iv) If press
manually pump start button, then tank_2 ﬁll-up manually but release button that
time pump will be off, otherwise tank ﬁll-up full then automatic stop pump. (v) If

Hardware Implementations and Result
Figure 5 shows the actual hardware setup of interfacing of Arduino, PLC, and
SCADA of proposed system of liquid level detection, and Fig. 6 shows the
mounting of sensor on tank and its control.
SCADA is interfaced with Ethernet-based communications which establish data
transfer serially. The InTouch 9.5 HMI is employed to quickly and easily develop
custom graphical views of their processes. The results were occupied in four cir-
cumstances and were characterized in Variable Table (VAT). The variable depic-
tion along with its status is presented. The manual overrule is turned off to enable
automatic procedure. Figures 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 show different conditions of the
proposed system, i.e., (1) overhead tank is empty and underground tank full,
(2) water is pumping in overhead tank, (3) underground tank is empty and overhead
tank full, (4) alarm indicating level of water lowers in underground tank, (5) water
pump manually operated, respectively.

Conclusion
Digitally controlled hybrid liquid level detection (HLLD) system using pro-
grammable logic controller (PLC) and microcontroller is articulated in this paper.
Some other automated level detecting schemes are also accessible so far, but most
of the methods have some practical limitations and proposed system can resolve
these problems with an competent automated liquid level monitoring and control-
ling system. Without making use of ﬂoat sensors, accurate results can be
acknowledged. Hence, unwanted vibrations and high costs of the ﬂoat sensors are
overwhelmed. A supple, inexpensive, and easy conﬁgurable system is established
which can solve concern of liquid wastage without any human supervision.

Realization of OTRA-Based Quadrature
Oscillator Using Third-Order Topology
Bal Chand Nagar and Sajal K. Paul
Abstract A new conﬁguration for realizing third-order quadrature oscillator
(TOQO) circuit using operational transresistance ampliﬁer (OTRA) with voltage
output is presented. It may also be reported as MOS-C realization, which eases the
integrated circuit implementation. It uses two OTRAs, four resistors, and three
capacitors. The frequency of oscillation and condition of oscillation are orthogo-
nally controllable. The effect of non-ideality analysis of the circuit is also given and
found that at high frequency the effect of parasitic capacitance is negligible.
PSPICE simulations and experimental test are provided to verify all the theoretical
analysis.

Introduction
Different variants of sinusoidal oscillators, such as single-phase, quadrature, and
multi-phase oscillators, generally form important block of a processing system. In
communication, such as ASK, PSK, QPSK, quadrature mixers, and SSB modula-
tors applications, there is a requirement of two/multiple sinusoids which are 90°
phase shifted. A quadrature oscillator may be used to generate such sinusoids,
which can be implemented using second-order and third-order networks. The
third-order topology provides good frequency response with high quality factor and
low distortion.
There are many methods to design third-order quadrature oscillators (TOQOs)
using different active building blocks (ABBs) in the literature. These include
realizations using OTA [1], CCII [2], current controlled conveyor (CCCII) [3],

current differencing transconductance ampliﬁer (CDTA) [4], differential voltage
current conveyor (DVCC) [5], combination of two different ABBs (DDCC + OTA
and CCCCTA + OTA) [6], operational ampliﬁer [7], operational transresistance
ampliﬁer (OTRA) [8, 9], and DVCCTA [10]. The TOQOs [1–5], [7, 8] use three or
more ABBs. Moreover, the topology [6] uses two different types of ABBs, which is
normally not encouraged. The topologies [7, 8] use more than four resistors. On the
other hand, the topology [5] provides neither independent CO nor FO, whereas the
oscillators [1, 2, 7] do not provide only independent control of frequency of
oscillation (FO). There are only few third-order quadrature oscillator topologies [9,
10], which use only two ABBs. Moreover, the topology [6] uses two different types
of ABBs, which is normally discouraged in integrated circuit implementation. The
topology [10] uses two DDCCTAs but the hardware implementation of each
DDCCTA using commercially available IC needs ﬁve numbers of IC AD844 and
four numbers of resistor and the topology [9] can not eliminate parasites easily.
A novel third-order QO using OTRAs is proposed. The circuit provides the
following useful features: (i) uses only two OTRAs, (ii) provides control of FO
independent of CO, (iii) MOS-C realization of the topology eases IC implemen-
tation, (iv) moreover, hardware implementation of each OTRA using commercially
available IC requires only two numbers of AD844 and one resistor, and (v) low
power consumption. The simulation and experimental results are provided.

The phase difference between V02 and V01 is 90°. It ensures that the proposed

The differential input of OTRA allows the implementation of electronically

where ln, Cox, and W/L represent standard MOS parameters and VA and VB are the

the integrated circuit implementation of QO. Figure 4 shows the MOS-C imple-
mentation of the proposed TOQO.
The output impedance of the OTRA is very small, ideally zero; hence, the two
output voltages, V01 and V02, can be connected to the next stage without any extra
circuitry, resulting in easy cascading with high output current drive capability.

The sensitivity study shows the variation of output response when we change
passive components by a small amount. The sensitivity of oscillation frequency
(x0) with respect to resistances (R1, R2, R3, and R4) and capacitances (C1, C2, and

where

ð13Þ
It is observed from Eq. (13) that Rm(s) will behave like a reactance for a
capacitor having value Cp. Taking the non-ideality effect of Rm(s), the characteristic
Eq. (2) modiﬁes to

It can be readily seen that with Cp ! 0, Eq. (14) reduces to their ideal form as in
(2). Here, Cp is the parasitic capacitance and it is inversely proportional to dc
transresistance gain (Rm(0)) and pole frequency (x0). For high frequency of oper-
ation, C2
p is very small and it can be neglected, then the Eq. (14) reduces to

Equations (16) and (17) reveal that the FO and CO are affected by Cp. However,
when R1 = R2 = R3 = R and C1 = C2 = C3 = C, then FO and CO [(16) and (17)]
revert back to the form of Eq. (5). Thus, the effect of Cp may be almost eliminated
without changing circuit topologies or without adding any additional elements
except selecting resistances (R1, R2, and R3) and capacitances (C1, C2, and C3) of
equal values.

Simulation and Experimental Results
The circuit is simulated using 0.5 µm MOSIS (AGILENT) process parameters. The
aspect ratios for PMOS and NMOS transistors are same as in [12], and supply
voltages used are VDD = −VSS = 1.5 V and VB = –0.5 V (Fig. 5).

The TOQO as shown in Fig. 2 is designed for a frequency of 18.38 MHz with
element values as R1 = R2 = R3 = 1 kX, R4 = 2.7 kX, C1 = C2 = C3 = 15 pF. The
steady-state waveforms of the TOQO are shown in Fig. 6. Figure 6a shows the
growth and sustained oscillations. The frequency spectrum (FFT) of the proposed
QO as shown in Fig. 6b has FO around 18.58 MHz. A slight deviation in the
frequency of the oscillator from theoretical values may be caused by the
non-idealities of the OTRA. Total harmonic distortion (%THD) as obtained for
proposed oscillator is 1.83%. It proves that the quality of output is good. The power
consumption of the oscillator is found to be 1.622 mW. Figure 7 shows the Monte
Carlo simulations which provide the strength of the proposed oscillator circuit by
taking result of 10 samples for ± 10% variations in R4. Monte Carlo simulation
results thus conﬁrm that the proposed oscillator works well even though the con-
dition of oscillation is disturbed little bit by varying R4. It also shows the range of
the % of samples in different output signal amplitude. Figure 8 shows the variation
of FO with R for the oscillator.
A hardware prototype of the proposed circuit as shown in Fig. 2 is also
assembled in breadboard to check its functionality experimentally. The OTRA is

constructed using the commercially available CFOA IC AD844AN as shown in
Fig. 9 with supply voltages ±6.5 V. The experiment is performed using the ele-
ment values of resistances and capacitances (R1 = R2 = R3 = 1 kX, R4 = 2.7 kX,
and C1 = C2 = C3 = 15 pF). The measured values of the resistances and capaci-
tances are obtained as R1 = 943 X, R2 = 951 X, R3 = 940 X, R4 = 2.56 kX,
C1 = 13.64 pF, C2 = 13.58 pF, and C3 = 13.41 pF for which calculated frequency
is found to be 21.55 MHz. The experimental response of the QO is shown in
Fig. 10. The measured FO is 21.6 MHz. It shows that the experimental result agrees
well with the theoretical value.

The comparison of the proposed work is discussed here. It reveals that the pre-
viously reported third-order current-mode building blocks-based quadrature oscil-
lators have one or more deﬁciencies such as (a) excessive number of ABBs,
(b)

(c)

(d) non-independent control of FO, and (e) use of mixed ABBs. The proposed
quadrature oscillator uses two ABBs, which is minimum in available literature [9,
10]. Moreover, topology [10] has independent control of FO as that of the proposed
one, the practical implementation of DVCCTA requires eight IC AD844 and eight
extra resistors in comparison with four IC AD844 and two extra resistors in proposed

one. It is found that the effect of parasitics can easily be eliminated in the proposed
circuit, which is not possible in [9].

Conclusion
New topologies for realizing voltage-mode third-order QO using OTRA have been
presented. The PSPICE simulations are performed using realization of the OTRA
based on MOS implementation and also tested experimentally using IC AD844.
The proposed design offers the feature of non-ideal parasitic capacitance (Cp) effect
elimination without any extra circuit element. Moreover, parasitic resistances Rn
and Rp at the input of OTRAs may be absorbed in external resistors (R1, R3, and
R4). The proposed circuit gives the following advantageous features: (i) use of
minimum ABBs, (ii) independent control of FO, (iii) low passive sensitivity,
(iv) low %THD, (v) low power consumption, (vi) MOS-C realization, which eases
integrated circuit implementation, and (vii) low output impedance. The function-
ality of the proposed circuit using simulation as well as experimental technique is
found to agree well with the theoretical proposition.

Mathematical Models for Solving
Problems of Reliability Maritime System
A. Nyrkov, K. Goloskokov, E. Koroleva, S. Sokolov, A. Zhilenkov
and S. Chernyi
Abstract Mathematical models are proposed, and on their basis, software is
developed. Methods of the risk theory are used to minimize the risks. Risk is a
consequence of the impact of uncertainty on the achievement of goals.
A consequence of inﬂuence in the paper refers to the deviation from the goal,
expressed in the expected results and the deviation of certain criteria indicators. In
this case, we mean any measure of quality. In its turn, risk factors reduce criteria
indicators. These factors are divided into categories: general transportation risks and
risks of transporting ground. In these categories, one may derive the following
risks: incidents at transport resulting from the impact of a set of random factors,
including the human one. Furthermore, it should be noted that the occurrence of a
risk situation could determine and have a direct impact on the other. As a result, you
may experience a chain of risks connected to each other.

Research Problem
During the global crisis, the maritime industry continues to evolve. However, some
areas do not show strong growth. Commercial and industrial ﬂeet is a strategic
component of every country and region. Mathematical research for the solution of
problems of the maritime industry in our time is rather urgent task. Many scientists
investigate this industry. The study is a problem in this publication is focused on the
use of fuzzy logic and programming.
Modern offshore drilling platforms (ODPs) are completely self-contained objects
consisting in terms of automation of a variety of complex subsystems, each of
which has, in turn, their own local control and central management for the entire
complex. In fact, each of these subsystems, starting from elementary sensors and
ending with central control units, is a set of critical components as potential sources
of unwanted processes scenarios in the system and, consequently, the cause of the
failure. Thus, modern offshore drilling platforms are characterized by a high level of
automation of core processes with the congregation of the local automatic control
subsystems into a common set of controlled automation systems such as
«Amphion», «Cybershot». In general, the ODP is a complex system that operates in
non-deterministic conditions associated with low predictable drilling conditions,
and the occurrence of an emergency with a high degree of probability can lead to
catastrophic consequences [1, 2].
Risk management involves the creation of the environment of proactive or
reactive (but with higher reaction rate) decision making within the target ODP
system prone to the risks able in real time to identify the possibility of a continuous
(i.e., to predict) under these conditions scenarios, within which this process can go
down the wrong path.
The difference between the proactive risk management from the reactive one is
that with the reactive management overcoming the erroneous scenario begins at its
climax, while managing proactively the prediction of occurrence of erroneous
scenario is made in the judgment of any prerequisites for its development. Thus,
with proactive management, the focus is given not only to the prevention of the
development of emerging adverse scenario plans, but also to the methods of early
identiﬁcation of the latter and the effective prevention by all available means, before
the scenario starts to be implemented, and its effects have begun to acquire the
critical scale.
The need to address the improvement of tools and methods to optimize the
controlling of costs determines the relevance of the research. Increasing the prac-
tical importance of development and improvement of cost controlling causes the
growth of scientiﬁc interest in their research.
An important task of the functioning of marine systems is the analysis of

Materials and Methods of Research
The main trend in the development of control systems in industry is to transit from
centralized to distributed intelligent systems based on network technologies. With
the development of microprocessor technology and telecommunications, the
opportunity has appeared to place the information processing means near the
automation objects. It allows you to create effective control systems with locally
distributed equipment—so-called distributed control systems. Operation of power
plants and many other objects determines the subject area of the control systems for
such objects in real time.
Quality control of ship’s diesel generators is a difﬁcult task requiring a high
performance of the control system (CS). One of the stages of decision making is the
formation of criteria for the performance evaluation, i.e., metrics, which compares
the “quality” of possible solutions x 2 X: In terms of multicriteriality, the most
promising approach to the assessment of the problem is the formation of a gen-
eralized multiscalar evaluation of P(x) on a set of particular criteria kjðxÞ; j ¼ 1; m.
To do this, one must solve the problem of structural–parametric identiﬁcation of
models of formation of P1(x). The effectiveness of the CS is an integrated feature
for the set of technical, operational, and economic performance of the equipment. It
requires continuous improvement of both individual indicators and approaches to
the integrated assessment of the CS efﬁciency [3–5].
To achieve the objectives, the following items should be developed:
1. A method to develop mathematical models of the operational control system for
the ship’s diesel generators.
2. Systematization of methods of formation of the elements in the operational
control system for the ship’s diesel generators.
3. The implementation of the decision-making stages by the person engaged in
decision-making (DM) in the operation of the ship’s diesel generators.
4. Development of the functional structure of the decision-making system
(DMS) using the controlling action adoption system.
The target of research in this paper is management information systems for the
ship’s diesel generator operation.
The scope of research is the method of complex solution for the problem of
decision making using the group accounting for the arguments while assessing the
efﬁciency of the operational control system.
When carrying the tasks outlined in the paper, methods of system analysis and
mathematical modeling were used. The main research tool was a software package
MATLAB.

The Results of Research
In this study, a comprehensive approach to evaluating the effectiveness of the
control system is considered from a uniﬁed point of performance evaluation, since
evaluation of CS without its prediction as incomplete as the forecasting efﬁciency
CS without assessing its current state. Due to the limited knowledge about the
processes of intellectual activity in the implementation of decision-making proce-
dure by the decision maker, it is advisable to determine the structure of the mul-
ticriteria model for evaluation of the CS effectiveness within the class of polynomial
models and, in particular, on the basis of the Kolmogorov–Gabor polynomial [2].

kiðxÞ; kjðxÞ; klðxÞ are particular criteria characterizing the decision; ki, kij, kijl are
isomorphism factors reducing all the summands of a polynomial in one dimension
and taking into account the importance (“weight”) of each of them. However, even
within the Kolmogorov–Gabor polynomial a variety of different models can be
synthesized. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate a criterion for selecting a single
version of the model. The most important indicator of the “quality” of the model is
the accuracy of the approximation of the experimental data, by which the model and
its predictive capability are identiﬁed, i.e., the accuracy of calculation of output
variables for input variables, which are not included in the original (training) pilot
sequence [1, 3, 5–7]. This means that it is necessary to synthesize such a model that
approximates the objectively existing relationship between the input and output
variables, i.e., minimizes some functional of the form

Due to the particular speciﬁc features of the object being modeled, other accu-
racy estimates may be used. As with any complex system, the “quality” of a
mathematical model cannot be described adequately by means of the single crite-
rion. The accuracy of the model, though being important, is the local (particular)
assessment of its “quality”. Therefore, let us introduce an additional particular
criterion such as relevance and complexity of the model. The adequacy of the
model will be regarded as the validity of the model, i.e., the stability of its accuracy
at all feasible set of input variables. The complexity of the model will be treated as a
relative measure, characterizing features and dimensions of the model structure. The
relative valuation indicates that compared to the complexity of the models of the
same class, for example, the model described by the Kolmogorov–Gabor polyno-
mial is compared.
In this case, the evaluation of the model complexity should take into account the
dimensions of the input variables X 2 En, the dimensions of the output variables
Y 2 Em, the total number of the polynomial members being characterized by the
dimensions of the nonzero coefﬁcient tuple k, and the maximal order of the
polynomial. Then, the complexity assessment of the polynomial model will be as
follows [2]
Q ¼ n þ m þ a þ b;
ð5Þ
where a is the number of the polynomial summands; b is the maximum power of
the polynomial terms. n is the number of input variables; m is the number of output
variables.
The complexity of the model is determined by its accuracy and adequacy. In
particular, if the number of Kolmogorov–Gabor polynomial terms is equal to the
number of experimental samples by which the model is identiﬁed, so the approx-
imation error, i.e., model error, is zero. However, this does not mean that the model
has good predictive qualities, i.e., the ability to predict accurately the value of the
output variable for any value of the input variables. This is due to the fact that the
initial experimental sample, which is used to identify the model, contains infor-
mation not only on the actual relationship between input and output, but also on
measurement errors, random interferences, etc.
Determination of the model with optimal complexity is associated with the
implementation of the principle of external addition [3], which means that the
predictive accuracy of the model should be determined based on the “independent”
experimental data, which are called test statistics and are not used in solving the

problem of the model identiﬁcation. Thus, all the raw experimental data are divided
into two sets—a training one that the model is identiﬁed and testing one, which is
determined by its prognostic quality.

Practical Implementation and Veriﬁcation
The proposed method has been taken as the basis for the creation of risk identiﬁ-
cation program in order to construct the models in the tasks of diagnosing the
emergencies on the ODP. Characteristics of models are shown in Table 1.
Experimental data obtained on the designed models have shown the efﬁciency
and effectiveness of the proposed method and its practical implementation with
relatively low-resource requirements of computational devices.
From the data in Table 1, it follows that the use of the proposed method sig-
niﬁcantly reduces the volumes of sample and does not require multiple passes at the
same time for the initial sample. The latter signiﬁcantly reduces resource con-
sumption for the method, while at the same time maintaining the most important
topological properties of the original sample in the subsample being formed and for
subsequent analysis [1, 7, 8].
5
Further Reduction of the Samples Being Formed
and the Analysis of Identiﬁed Risks
Analysis in the context of this paper is referred as for converting data obtained in
the process of identifying risks into information based on which it is possible to
prioritize the implementation of the identiﬁed risk, and, ultimately, to produce the
input data required for decision support for risk management.
This function suggests analysis for every identiﬁed risk, the result of which is the
assessment of each of these risks in terms of consequences and the probability of
their occurrence. The latter category in general includes also such a parameter as a
recurrence rate in a certain time interval.
The assessment of consequences of a certain risk being realized may be made in
terms of the following characteristics of the impact on the equipment and processes:

• Cost—ﬁnancial losses;
• Time—downtime of the equipment and production interruptions;
• The efﬁciency of the equipment or process performance;
• The quality of the process implementation or equipment operation.
Thus, the dimensions of the reduced sample formed in terms of the set of
representative parameters can be further reduced to two factors, namely the like-
lihood and magnitude of potential impacts.
The process of formalizing the decision of tasks in a particular domain can be
represented in a model and expressed in the set of arrays M ¼ X; A; Y; F

X; A; Y are arrays of respective control, and ﬁxed and controlled parameters of the
environment; F is an array of functional dependencies which link the elements of
arrays X; A; Y. In order to realize the dialogue in a better way, let us introduce brief
verbal characteristics of the relevant parameters in arrays X; A; Y. In this case arrays
X and Y will be represented as set of the following regular pairs: X ¼

Conclusion
Based on the proposed method, it is possible to create the system supervisor,
integrated with the central ODP control system that allows not only to minimize the
inﬂuence of the human factor in the control of alarms and process for veriﬁcation of
information about emergencies, but also to manage the processes in terms of
maximum efﬁciency, by taking into account the possible risks.
Further research in this area can be devoted to the search for new ways to form
descriptions of instances as summarized indicators. Implementation of the proposed
method with the use of software and hardware supporting parallel computations and
distributed data processing is also relevant.

Tuning PID Controller for Inverted
Pendulum Using Genetic Algorithm
C. Sravan Bharadwaj, T. Sudhakar Babu and N. Rajasekar
Abstract The Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers are extensively
used as the controllers for controlling the system outputs. The performance of the
system is mainly depends on the parameters of the PID controller. To tune these
parameters, various techniques are available, and in these methods, there exists
drawbacks. To overcome these drawbacks in this paper, the tuning of PID
parameters are done by using genetic algorithm, and it is effectively tested on linear
inverted pendulum system (LIP). In addition, extensive simulations are performed
by varying parameters of the pendulum. For brevity, comparison is made with Z–N
methods of tuning, and it is observed that GA-tuned PID controller is giving better
performance.

Introduction
The controllers are placing major in the automated industry due to its efﬁcient
operation of system. In this PID, controller is extensively used in industry due to its
simplicity and effectiveness. To realize any controller, the gains of controller must
be determined effectively. To determine the gains of PID controller, more efforts
has been devoted to reduce the required time and to optimize the PID parameter
values. There are numerous tuning techniques are available based on the

implementation methods [1]. Tuning methods are mainly classiﬁed as: (i) empirical
methods (Z–N) (ii) analytical method such as root–locus-based design, and
(iii) Optimization methods such as iterative feedback tuning. For the extensive
range of industrial applications, Z–N ﬁne-tuning technique suits well, but the main
shortcoming of this process is that the operator needs to have clear awareness about
plant model [2]. Once it is tuned by Z–N technique, it gives good response, but it is
not optimum. If there exists any change in the plant dynamics, then the transient
response of the system will vary drastically. To guarantee an independent perfor-
mance, the controller must have the capability of adapting to the changes in the
plant dynamics [3]. Current years, artiﬁcial intelligent methods such as fuzzy logic,
genetic algorithms (GA), and neural networks are rigorously used due to various
features.
Advancements in digital technology have made the controllers automatic. The
automatic control system facilitates a wide range of options for control schemes,
despite the fact that more than 90% of industrial controllers are still employed based
on the PID algorithms, mostly at the low levels, since none of the controller will
facilitate the advantages like PID controller. The main features of PID controller are
applicability, clear functionality, and simplicity in structure. There are numerous
optimization and optimal control procedures available for linear and nonlinear
dynamic systems [4–6] to meet the performance optimization requirements of
dynamic systems.
The authors in [7] tuned controller constants in a trial-and-error technique, which
was time consuming and increased the complexity, and the system response is not
satisfactory. More efﬁcient ways to optimize PID gains has been proposed by the
authors in [8–10]; in these methods, authors implemented the deterministic opti-
mization procedures based on the integrated absolute error (IAE) standards are
used, but these techniques use the predeﬁned MATLAB toolbox and their tuned
gains are optimum in only certain operative regions and these techniques are not
robust. To bring the inverted pendulum to be stable in vertical position and to
control the cart at the preferred position, two PID controllers are required. One can
be used for the rod angle control known as angle PID controller, and another for the
cart position, and it is referred as cart PID controller [1]. This method increases the
complexity of the system. To overcome the drawbacks of existing systems, opti-
mization techniques were widely used for effective operation of system.
Genetic algorithms (GA’s) are search techniques motivated by the laws of a
genetics and natural selection. The GA is ﬁrst implemented by Holland based on the
Darwin’s principal. This can be seen as an optimization technique and is applied to
search, machine learning, and optimization tasks [11–13]. GA was effectively
adapted to the system dynamics [14]. In this article, gains of PID controller are
tuned via GA method for a linear inverted pendulum. To illustrate the effectiveness
of genetic algorithm-tuned PID controller, the impulse and step* responses are
plotted and are compared with that of the conventional (Z–N) method.

Mathematical Model
In this analysis, an inverted pendulum on a moving cart is explored. A pendulum
rod is moved around a rigid pivot point ﬁxed to the cart, driven by the stepper motor
which is forced to move on the horizontal platform. The rod is set in the vertical
position, which is known as an equilibrium point. Main intention is to apply a force
to move the cart so that the pendulum stays in the vertical position. The system is
shown in Fig. 1, where F is the force in Newton, m is the mass of the pendulum rod
in kilogram, M is the mass of the moving cart in kilogram, FV is the force applied to
the cart in Newton, Ff is the force due to friction in Newton, g is the acceleration
due to gravity in ms2, and h is the angle of the inverted pendulum measured from
the vertical y-axis in radians.
Consider the free-body diagrams shown in Fig. 2. In addition, assume that the
coordinates of the center of gravity of the pendulum, (xG, yG), are given by:
xG ¼ x þ 1 sin h;
yG ¼ 1 cos h

PID Controller
Tuning of PID controller is a challenging task, even though there are only three
parameters in the system, because it must satisfy several criteria within the limi-
tations of PID control. Controller design and tuning seem to be theoretically
intuitive; however, it can be tough in real time, if various objectives such as good
stability and transient response are to be attained. PID controllers generally provide
adequate control by default tunings by using the traditional methods, but perfor-
mance can be enhanced by ﬁne tuning, and poor tuning may lead to undesirable
performance. Typically, initial designs need to be adjusted frequently through
simulations until the closed-loop system performs as desired. The most common
practice in industries is to utilize PID controller. The schematic of PID is shown in
Fig. 3. This set up is acknowledged as parallel form or non-interacting form.
The output of a general PID controller in a parallel form is given as:

where Kp,Ti, and Td are proportional gain, integral, differential time constants.
Ki ¼ Kp=Ti, Kd ¼ KpTd kp ki are derivative and integral gains, respectively.
The tuning of PID means generating the gains of individual controller in a system,
for this conventional Z–N method is used. It is based on critical gain Kc and oscillation
period Tc. In this technique, the integral time Ti is initially set to inﬁnity, and the
derivative time Td is set to zero. This step is only for the proportional control. Kp will
be varied until the system output is oscillatory, and the gain pertaining to this is called
as critical gain. In case the output is not oscillatory which indicates Z–N method is not
applied.The goal is to minimize the peak overshoot within the limit of 10%. In case the
maximum overshoot is greater than 15%, gain adjustment has to be done to decrease it
to less than 10%. The parameters tuned using Ziegler–Nichols frequency method [1];
the parameters of PID controller are tuned and shown in Table 2.

Genetic Algorithm
Genetic algorithm is a population-based global search algorithm that follows
Darwin’s principle of survival of the ﬁttest was ﬁrst proposed by John Holland and
his students in the year 1970. The process of GA starts without any knowledge of
the output, it will adapt to the environment in which it is working, and the opti-
mization will take place with the help of its operators such as crossover, mutation,
and reproduction to attain the global best solution. The method starts with random
initial values and explore the search space parallelly. GA’s can be applied to
complex problems irrespective of its dimensionality, compared to the other gradient
techniques which depends on the order of derivative [14].

Characteristics of Genetic Algorithm
In GA method, solution to the problem is represented as chromosome, and groups
of chromosomes form population. Chromosomes are individually awarded with
ﬁtness and compared with the other in the population and the success rate is

determined. To attain the better solution, genetic algorithm uses the genetic pro-
cedures such as crossover and mutation for generating new set of population. This
process is achieved by combining two chromosomes or by changing the bits in
chromosomes. Selection of parental chromosomes will be based on the ﬁtness of
the parents. By this type of selection, the child chromosomes will have the better
characteristics of both parents. Initialization of chromosomes is done with the set of
20–100 chromosomes. In this article, chromosomes are represented in binary. The
performance of individual chromosomes is evaluated by a function called objective
function. The objective function value for the corresponding chromosome is called
as ﬁtness value. The evaluation is based on ﬁtness value and the strongest
chromosomes are survived for the next iteration.
Here, each chromosome is having three parts as Kp, Ki, Kd with a length of 30 bit
and 10 bit for each parameter.
Steps involved in development and implementation of GA.
1. Initialize the GA parameters.
2. Evaluate the chromosomes for best ﬁtness.
3. Parents should be selected based on the ﬁtness.
4. Reproduction is done by the roulette wheel method.
5. Crossover is introduced to the chromosomes after reproductions.
6. Mutation is done for the resulted chromosomes at lowest probability.
7. Iterate the process from step 2 to 6 until the performance criteria is met. The
values of parameters used for the experimentation are given as, Population
size = 20, Length of chromosome = 30, Length Kp ¼ 10, Length of Ki ¼ 10,
Length of Kd ¼ 10, Max. Generations = 50, 0  Kp  100, 0  Ki  100,

4.2
Objective Function Problem Formulation
Here, the objective function is framed to tune PID gains in such a way that it
provides less peak over shoot, small rise time. Each chromosome is evolved, and
chromosome having highest ﬁtness considers to be the ﬁttest chromosome. GA uses
the ﬁtness values of individuals to produce a new generation set of population
comprising of the members with best ﬁtness.
In the evaluation process, the chromosome is divided into 3 parts and it is used

Results
In this section, the simulations have been performed to evaluate the response of
GA-tuned controller. Calculations are performed with 20 chromosomes. The tuned
controller is characterized by minimum overshoot, less settling time, and rise time.
The best response will then be chosen.
The parameters of GA are chosen as: probability of crossover = 0.8, probability
of mutation = 0.3, generations = 50, crossover is single point crossover, and
selection is roulette wheel selection. From the Fig. 4, an impulse disturbance of 0.1
PID controller is giving a peak of 0.08, whereas GA-tuned controller is giving
around 0.1. Settling time has drastic improvement in GA-tuned PID controller and
it is around 0.15 s, whereas in traditional controller it is around 1 s.
Hardware plots are plotted without disturbance in pendulum angle and cart
position because of complexity in providing same disturbance with same magnitude
since the disturbance is given manually. The cases with disturbance are shown in
the simulation results. Different sets of PID gains tuned by GA are veriﬁed on
hardware, and the plots for both cart position and pendulum angle are plotted for all
methods including conventional method. From the hardware response with the 2
types of PID tuning, conventional PID controller will make the pendulum oscillate
around the 3.14, but ITAE-based gains provide less oscillations. The experimental
setup is shown in Fig. 5.

Conclusion
From the experimentations, it can be conclude that GA-tuned PID controller will
give the faster and good response compared to traditional PID controller tuning
methods. These traditional methods will lead us to a starting value of PID controller
gains but not the optimal one. Along with this, obtaining gain from classical
techniques
is
more
troublesome.
It
requires
more
steps,
and
sometimes
trial-and-error procedure is to be followed for reaching the desired performance.
With GA tuning, the sound knowledge about the system is not required. The tuning
time also will be reduced with the help of GA tuning.

LQR PI Controller Design for First-Order
Time-Delay Systems
K. Harshavardhana Reddy, Prabhu Ramanathan, Sudha Ramasamy
and P. Sanjeevikumar
Abstract In this paper, a linear quadratic regulator-based PI controller is designed to
control the ﬁrst-order time-delay systems. In most of the linear systems, the time
delay is commonly found and this delay causes the performance of the system to
deteriorate. So to achieve the good performance having delay, need to ﬁnd the
optimal PI controller gains. For this purpose, in this paper PI controller gains are ﬁnd
out by using the LQR, it gives the optimal gain values. In the design of LQR-based PI
controller, the selection of Q matrices plays a vital role. So a skew symmetric
matrix-based feedback gain matrix is used in selection of Q matrices. The proposed
method is validated through various simulation examples. The results are compared
to other existing techniques to show the better performance of the proposed method.

Introduction
In this paper, a design of optimal PI controller for ﬁrst-order time-delay systems
using LQR theory is proposed. The PI/PID controllers are mostly used in all
industrial applications such as chemical process and electrical applications because
it has simple design and achieves the good performance [1]. The time-delay
problem is found in many industrial control applications, to control the system
having time delay is changeling task. A lot of research is going on to ﬁnd the
optimal, robust controller gains for time-delay process [2]. This section provides the
exiting methods using the LQR PI controller and methods to ﬁnd the selection of
weight matrices. In the recent past, several works are reported on LQR and
implemented on advanced controllers such as self-adjusting LQR, hybrid LQR,
fuzzy LQR, and LQR-based PI/PID controllers. In [3], authors explain the design of
the PI controller for time-delay process using LQR. Same procedure is also used in
this paper. However, the two constraints of LQR problem have been the subject of
investigation since 1960s and the problems are selection of weight matrices (Q and
R) and solution to algebraic Riccati equation (ARE). These two problems are
strongly time dependent on certain operations conditions. Even if all of the control
strategies are optimal in nature, different Q and R values will give nonoptimal
system performance. In the design of LQR PI controller, the selection of ‘R’ and
weight matrices ‘Q’ is important to achieve the optimal performance. In [3], the
LQR PI controller algorithm was developed for time-delay systems. In this paper
proposed the feedback gain matrix-based selection of weight matrices. This
methods gives the high integral errors.
In [4], author proposed a genetic algorithm (GA) is to ﬁnd the weight matrices ‘Q’
using the feedback regulator, to minimize of integral performance index. In [5],
authors used an multiobjective algorithm to selection of weight matrices. This
algorithm used an integral time multiplied squared error (ITSE) and integral squared
deviation output (ISDCO). In [6], authors proposed an adaptive practical swarm
optimization (APSO) to design LQR PI controller for application of laboratory
helicopter. This algorithm takes more to time to achieve the global optimization. In
[7], the authors designed the LQR PI controller for second-order plus dead-time
process using the dominant pole placement technique. This method is an analytical
approach to ﬁnd the weights of q1 and q2. From the literature on design of LQR PI
controller, weight matrices play vital role and existing methods have certain disad-
vantages like taking more time because most of the algorithms take more number of
interactions to converge. As optimization techniques used are nonlinear, the global
solution cannot be guaranteed. To overcome the above problems, a new skew
symmetric-based feedback gain matrix is introduced to ﬁnd the optimal selection of
weight matrices Q. The organization of paper as follows: Sect. 1 is literature review
of paper, Sect. 2 describes the design of LQR PI controller, Sect. 3 explains the
proposed method to selection of weight matrices, Sect. 4 shows the simulation
results, and ﬁnally, Sect. 5 gives the conclusion of the work.

Proposed Method to Selection of Weight Matrices
In this section‚ the analysis of the output responses for different values of 'Q' has
been presented. If the values selected in the weight matrix(Q) are very random then
the performance of the system will be poor and therefore the selection of values for
'Q' matrix should be deﬁned as per the considered process.
Figure 2 shows the transient response for various ‘Q’ matrix values. Here, three
cases are taken into consideration to show the performance. Case (i) is selection of
‘Q’ values randomly as q1 = 1 and q2 = 1, for this the obtained integral absolute
error (IAE) is 1.23. For Case (ii), the ‘Q’ matrix is selected as q1 = 2 and q2 = 2 and
the IAE obtained as 1.25. For case (iii), selection of ‘Q’ values randomly as q1 = 2
and q2 = 1, the obtained IAE is 1.65. From this observation, the selection of ‘Q’
matrix is random, it will give the high integral error and poor performance as shown
in Fig. 2 (Table 1).
As above mentioned, the output performance of the LQR-based controller
depends on ‘Q’ matrices. This paper proposed a skew symmetric matrix [9]-based

feedback gain matrix to select the weight matrices ‘Q’. The performance of the
system gives better optimal response when speciﬁc choice of weight matrices is
optimum values.
The feedback gain matrix is given Eq. (14), is modiﬁed using the skew sym-
metric matrix, formula is AT ¼ A; then, it becomes the AT þ A ¼ 0. Let us con-
sider the A as the feedback matrix. So Eq. (14) is modiﬁed as shown in Eq. (18).
Ac ¼ A  ððA  BFÞ þ A  BFÞTÞ
ð18Þ
Substituting the values in Eq. (18) and determine the characteristics equation of
closed-loop matrix which is equal to the desired closed-loop equation as shown in
Eq. (19).
DðsÞ ¼ sI  Ac
j
j ¼ s2 þ 2  nmxm þ x2
m ¼ 0

Then we get the optimal values of weight matrices as shown in Eqs. (20) and

q2 ¼ ð2  nm  xm  aÞ2  4  a2  2  x4

The parameters of proportional and integral gains are obtained by using the
values of damping ratio (nm) and natural frequency (xm). The selection of these
parameters are speciﬁed in the range of = [0.7 to 1.0] and L = [1.0 to 1.5] [3, 7].

Simulation Results and Discussion
Let us consider the simple ﬁrst-order delay system model to design the LQR PI
controller using the proposed selection of weight matrices method to validate the
results through the two examples. Example (1) is shown in Eq. (22).

time-delay systems. The skew symmetric matrix with damping ratio and natural
frequency method gives the optimal weight matrices, which leads desired system
response to achieve control goals. Simulations results are obtained as shown in
Sect. 4, which shows the accuracy of proposed controller and their efﬁciency in
achieving desired time-domain speciﬁcations. Further studies are implemented for
diverse industrial applications.

Determination of Protein Content
of Castor Leaves Using UV-Based Sensor
System
Jhimli Kumari Das and Shakuntala Laskar
Abstract Protein is the building block for the growth of all living creatures. The
protein content in different food products can be analysed by various invasive and
non-invasive methods which can be either direct or indirect way of measurement.
This paper proposes non-destructive and indirect in vivo analysis of the protein
content by using optical sensor system. The sensor system is based on the study of
the optical properties like transmittance and absorbance of the castor leaf. The
results are validated with that of the results derived from chemical analysis. The
relationship between the protein content and the absorbance of different leaves were
found to be highly correlated. The results show that the proposed system can be
used to determine the quality of the castor leaf based on its protein content.

Introduction
Protein is an important parameter that determines the quality of the food consumed
by various living beings. It also plays a vital role in determining the quality of the
silk that is spun by the silkworms. One such silkworm is the Eri silkworm which
primarily feeds on castor leaves and is the source of all sort of nutrition for these
worms. There are many invasive and non-invasive methods for quantiﬁcation of
protein content in leaves, and the invasive methods are based on chemical analysis
which is time-consuming and also destroys the sample. The non-invasive method on

the other hand is non-destructive and consumes less time, but the most commonly
used techniques are very costly and require expertise to operate the device [1–4].
This paper proposes a simple optical sensor system for determination of protein in
castor leaves which is non-destructive in nature and is also cost effective. There are
many optical systems that are used for determination of protein in variety of food
items, and these systems are based on near-infrared spectroscopy. The spectroscopic
method is used to measure either transmittance or reﬂectance of the sample, and the
content of protein is related with the values of the optical parameters. The chloro-
phyll meter is also used for measurement of protein which is related with the nitrogen
content in the leaves. The UV absorbance spectroscopy is one of the preferred
chemical methods for determination of protein as it gives more accurate protein
concentration compared to colorimetric assays.
The proposed sensor system is designed using UV source and detector, and the
results obtained from the sensor system were then compared with the readings
obtained from the spectrophotometer at 660 nm. The spectrophotometric readings
were based on Lowry method which is one of the popular methods for determi-
nation of protein content. The sensor system actually records the transmittance
values through the sample leaf. The transmittance values were then converted to
absorbance by taking log of the transmittance, i.e., log (1/T). The absorbance values
of spectrophotometer and the sensor system were compared to establish the relation
between the protein content of the leaf and the sensor reading.

Materials and Methods
The samples of castor leaves were collected from the plants growing in the roadside
of the suburban areas of Guwahati, Assam, and not from plants grown under
controlled conditions because the device is designed for farmers who do not always
grow the plants in prerequisite conditions as sericulture in Assam is carried out
along with other farming activities. The leaves were plucked at different climatic
conditions like the ﬁrst sample was collected in the month of January, the second in
the month of May and third one in the month of August. The samples collected in
the month of January comprised of four leaves from different positions of the plant
starting from the leaf at the top that has just opened, and immediately after that the
ﬁrst leaf the second, third and the fourth leaves were taken. The same was repeated
for the month of May whereas in the month of August the ﬁfth and the eight leaf
from the top was taken. The plants from which the samples were collected were
from different locations and also of different variety. The plants for the month of
January and May had reddish stems and green leaves, and plant sample for the
month of August had green stems and green leaves.

Chemical Analysis
The chemical analysis to determine the protein content of the leaf samples was done
using the Lowry’s method which is one of the most commonly used spectropho-
tometric methods. All the solutions were prepared fresh. The phosphate buffer of
pH-7.6 was prepared using 0.2 M monobasic sodium phosphate (NaH2PO4) and
0.2 M dibasic sodium phosphate (Na2HPO4). This buffer solution was used with the
leaf samples for protein extraction. Apart from the buffer solution, alkaline Na2CO3
was prepared by dissolving 0.4 g of NaOH in 100 ml of distilled water. Likewise
the copper sulphate reagent was prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of CuSO4  5H2O in
distilled water and then adding 1 g of sodium potassium tartarate. The volume of
the solution was then adjusted up to 100 ml. This copper sulphate reagent was
made alkaline by mixing 1 ml of copper sulphate solution in 50 ml of alkaline
solution mentioned above [5].
2.2
Protein Extraction
The protein was extracted by crushing the leaves of four different leaf samples
separately in mortar and pestle by adding buffer solution to it. Supposing if 1.5 g of
castor leaf is taken, then 1.5 ml of the buffer solution was added to the leaves to
prepare the mixture. The mixture was then put in centrifuge tube that is fully
covered and kept overnight so that maximum protein can be extracted. The juice
from this mixture was extracted by putting the crushed sample in a clean piece of
cloth and squeezing it. This juice was then used as the sample whose absorbance
reading was observed. 1 ml of each sample of four different leaves was taken in four
different test tubes, and 5 ml of alkaline copper sulphate solution was added to it.
This solution was then shaked properly and kept for resting for 10 min. After
10 min, 0.5 ml of Folin’s reagent was added to it, and the solution was again mixed
properly and kept in a dark chamber for another 30 min. The absorbance values at
660 nm of these samples were recorded from a spectrophotometer with respect to a
reference of 0.5 M NaOH [5] (Fig. 1).

2.3
Sensor System
The sensor system comprises of a UV source (390 nm) and a compatible detector
(ML8511 sensor). The sensor gives the output in analog voltage that is linearly
related with the measured UV intensity (mW/cm2). After plucking the sample leaf,
it is put in a stand between the source and detector, and the transmittance value was
recorded in terms of voltage. The reading was also recorded for red LED as it had a
wavelength around 660 nm, and it could have been related with that of the spec-
trophotometer reading. The output transmittance value was then converted to
absorbance values by using the basic colorimetric analysis (Fig. 2).
The transmittance can be deﬁned by:
T = I1
I0  100%
I1 is the intensity of light when it passes through the leaf sample, and Io is the
reference intensity without the leaf. The absorbance (A) is given by:
A ¼ log 1=T
ð
Þ
The distance between the source and the detector was kept as 1.5 cm because if
the distance between the two increased then the absorbance value would decrease.
Moreover, as the device is supposed to be a small hand-held one, the distance
between the source and the detector also has to be less. A ﬁgure representing the
system is shown in Fig. 3.
2.4
Calibration Experiment
The relationship between the protein content and the absorbance was established by
taking a standard protein solution, i.e., a bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution. The
Lowry method was used to determine this relationship. In this, 50 mg of BSA

was dissolved in distilled water, the volume of which later adjusted to 50 ml.
Therefore, 1 ml of this solution contained 1 mg of protein. It was observed from the
experimentation that with the change in the protein concentration, the absorbance
also varied. This variation was linear in nature, i.e., as the protein content increased,
the absorbance also increased. A graph plotted from the reading of the spec-
trophotometer for the same is shown below. This concept was later used to rep-
resent the relationship between the absorbance readings from the spectrophotometer
with that of the developed sensor system (Fig. 4).

Result and Discussion
As discussed above, four leaves from four different plant positions were considered
as the samples. The ﬁrst plant had red stems and a bit dark green leaves. The
youngest leaf from the tip of the tree was considered as the ﬁrst sample, and other
three samples were leaves more matured than the previous one. The graph showing
the relationship between the absorbance of the spectrophotometer and the sensor
system is shown below. From the graph, it is seen that the youngest leaf has
minimum absorbance which indicates that the protein content of this leaf is the
minimum, whereas the second leaf sample which is from the third plant position has
the maximum protein content. The sensor system is less sensitive to the fourth
decimal point variation which is evident in the graph. The reading of the same
samples was also taken using a red LED, but the relation between the spec-
trophotometer absorbance and the sensor system absorbance did not match. There

was a linear increase in absorbance of the sensor system with the increase in
maturity of the leaf. Hence, those readings were discarded (Fig. 5).
Likewise the readings for a different species of the castor plant were also con-
sidered which had green stems, and the younger leaves were of lighter shade of
green compared to the species discussed earlier. Here also it was observed that the
sensor system was not sensitive to the variation in the third decimal point as well.
But in both the cases, the changes in the spectrophotometer absorbance and the

sensor system absorbance followed the same trend, i.e., if one increased then the
other also increased or remained same due to sensitivity issues (Fig. 6).
Some leaves from different plant like papaya were also studied along with some
more matured leaves of the castor plant of the ﬁrst species. All these readings of the
papaya were put together with readings of the second species and shown below.
Since the experimentation was carried out for different plant species at different
time, there are some variations in the absorbance reading, but the overall trend was
similar except for papaya leaves which had different texture and structure of the
veins. The absorbance reading of the spectrophotometer was almost ten times more
than the sensor system reading (Fig. 7).
4
Conclusion
The observations given above showed that the absorbance values of the spec-
trophotometer are related with the protein content of the leaf. If the protein content
increased, then the absorbance also increased. Later the relation established
between the spectrophotometer reading and reading of the sensor system varied in
similar manner which indicated that the sensor system can be used to determine the
protein content of the leaf. The sensitivity of the system can be increased by using
some ampliﬁer circuits. The proposal thus justiﬁes the use of a system that is
simple, non-invasive and economical. The system was designed for speciﬁc use,
i.e., for castor leaves, and this can be modiﬁed to be used for other leaves as well.

Clamping Modulation
Amarnath Yalavarthi, Akbar Ahmad and Paulson Samuel
Abstract The modiﬁed structure of multilevel inverter including a capacitor in
series and parallel, providing voltage boost feature, is suitable for both symmetrical
and asymmetrical cascaded operations. It produces a more number of voltage levels
at the output with reduced number of switching devices when compared to the three
basic multilevel inverters, namely diode-clamped, ﬂying capacitor, and cascaded
multilevel inverters. The hardware in loop switched capacitor multilevel inverter
has been simulated and veriﬁed with the most popular and widely used sinusoidal
pulse width modulation and space vector-based bus clamping modulation tech-
niques. The vector modulation techniques have advantages of high output voltages
and reduced harmonic distortion as they utilize the DC bus effectively.
Bus-clamped pulse width modulation has the ability to reduce the switching losses
of the converter and has reduced harmonic distortion. This paper provides a
comparison between various control algorithms and bus clamping techniques for
modiﬁed multilevel inverter.

Introduction
Research and development are focused on renewable energies, as they are the major
future solution to the increasing energy demand. Power electronic converters with
improved efﬁciency play a prominent role in energy harvesting and supply to the
grid through dedicated controls [1]. This led to the innovation of a wide range of
power converter topologies. The research is still in progress to develop the most
efﬁcient and reliable converters. Multilevel inverters have replaced the earlier used
three-level inverters because of their high-quality output waveform, low-voltage
stress, and reduced switching losses [2–4]. Development of this prototype has given
the idea for the latest schemes of the multilevel inverter.
There are three conventional multilevel inverter categories: (1) diode-clamped
(neutral point clamped) multilevel inverter (DCMLI) [5], (2) capacitor-clamped
(ﬂying capacitor) multilevel inverter (CCMLI) [6], and (3) cascaded multilevel
inverter (CMLI) [7]. DCMLI has some drawbacks such as an unequal rating of the
devices, the high voltage rating of blocking diode, and the voltage unbalance.
CCMLI uses a large number of capacitors and requires a special technique to
balance the capacitor voltages. In CMLI, the problem of voltage unbalancing does
not arise, but it requires a number of isolated DC supplies for higher levels. Many
multilevel inverter topologies with reduced power devices and higher voltage levels
have been presented in [8–11].
The two main challenges for the converter are the quality of the output wave-
form and boosting of the input voltage. At ﬁrst, transformers are being served for
boosting the input voltage. But the use of transformer increases the size and cost of
the system and decreases the efﬁciency. This encouraged the research toward the
transformerless topologies. The ﬁrst transformerless topology with boosting capa-
bility was introduced in [12]. This type of converter uses switched capacitor con-
cept to boost the input voltage. But this includes a number of switches and has
certain limitations on a number of output levels. Later, many switched
capacitor-based topologies have been introduced to overcome those limitations
[13–15]. In [14], a topology has been introduced with the advantage of extending a
number of levels with reduced number of power switches. This topology has
inherent voltage balancing capability and a simpliﬁed gating circuit. A new hybrid
topology has been introduced in [15] which have an advantage of cascading the
units. This topology produces output levels based on the input voltage applied to
the cascaded unit.
In this paper, a switched capacitor-based multilevel inverter has been simulated,
and the output voltage and current waveform quality have been observed for both
SPWM and SVPWM modulation strategies. The simulation and experimental
results are presented at different modulation indices for RL load.

SCMLI Topology
The proposed converter operation is based on switched capacitor scheme. It has an
advantage of boosting the input voltage. Figure 1 shows the conﬁguration of the
proposed topology used. The boost in voltage level is obtained by a series–parallel
combination of the capacitor with the input voltage. When the capacitor is in
parallel to the input voltage, it gets charged, and when in series, it gets discharged
supporting the input voltage. Thus, the boost in the voltage level is achieved
without the use of a transformer.
Basic unit consists of two power switches, a diode and a capacitor, as shown in
Fig. 1. When the switch Sa is turned OFF and Sb is turned ON, capacitor comes in
parallel with the supply voltage. During this stage, the capacitor gets charged.
Vout ¼ VC ¼ Vin
When the switch Sa is turned ON and Sb is turned OFF, the capacitor network
adds to the supply voltage, thereby increasing the available voltage level:
Vout ¼ VC þ Vin
Vout ¼ 2Vin *VC ¼ Vin
ð
Þ
Both the switches Sa and Sb work complimentarily to each other and prevent the
supply voltage from being short. The diode in the circuit prevents the capacitor
discharging into the source. Thus, the output voltage is greater than input voltage
without any transformer, thus reducing the size and cost of the circuit. The level of
output voltage depends on the number of SC units used in the circuit. Various levels
can be achieved as discussed in Table 1.

Modulation Methods
The modulation techniques for multilevel inverters can be classiﬁed according to
the switching frequency. An exceptionally prominent strategy in modern applica-
tions is the multiple carrier sinusoidal PWM which uses phase-shifting strategy to
lessen the harmonic content in the voltage waveform [16]. Carrier-based PWM is
the most famous technique on account of its lucidity and ability to produce suitable
output signal. Many multicarrier strategies have been proposed and implemented to
reduce the harmonic distortion producing the high-quality output waveform with
triangular carrier in comparison with sinusoidal signal. This technique is classiﬁed
into 2 types: horizontal distribution (phase-shifted) technique and vertical distri-
bution (level-shifted) technique. In phase-shifted pulse width modulation strategy,
the equal amplitude and frequency carriers with slight shift in phase are compared
with modulating signal to generate driving switching signals [17]. To generate
n-level output waveform, n −1 carrier signals are required.
Amplitude modulation index is as follows:
ma ¼
2 * Am
n  1
ð
Þ * Ac
;
Frequency modulation index is as follows:
mf ¼ fc
fm
where Am and Ac are the amplitudes, and fm and fc are the frequencies of the
modulating and carrier signals, respectively [16].
The number of cascaded blocks in each phase is represented as Nc with the
carriers displaced by an angle using the same control signal to produce output
voltage with less distortion. The minimum distortion is achieved when the carriers
are shifted with an angle of hc ¼ 2p=Nc.
In level-shifted pulse width modulation strategy, the carriers with equal ampli-
tude and frequency are shifted vertically [17]. In phase disposition pulse width
modulation (PD-PWM), all the carriers are in phase. In phase opposition disposition
pulse width modulation (POD-PWM), the carriers above the zero reference are in
phase and those below the reference are shifted by 180°. In alternative phase
opposition disposition (APOD-PWM), each carrier signal is shifted by 180° from
the adjacent carrier.
In bus clamping techniques [18], each phase is clamped to either positive or
negative DC bus for a particular duration by adding a common-mode signal:
mR ¼ M * vR
ð
Þ þ mcm
ð1Þ
426
A. Yalavarthi et al.

mY ¼ M * vY
ð
Þ þ mcm
ð2Þ
mB ¼ M * vB
ð
Þ þ mcm
ð3Þ
where vR, vY, and vB are the three phases, M is the modulation index, mcm is the
common-mode signal, and mR, mY, and mB are the resulting modulating signals. The
phase to be clamped and the period of clamping majorly depend on the location of
desired reference voltage vector [19]. In 30° clamping, each phase gets clamped for
the duration of 30° in every quarter cycle. In 60° clamping, the duration is of 60°
for a half cycle of the phase. 60° strategies perform better when compared to
30° clamping at higher modulation indices [20]. In this paper, 60° bus clamping
technique has been discussed, and Fig. 2 shows the modulating signal. The
common-mode signal is generated based on the following equations:

modulating signal as in Fig. 2.

The simulations were realized with input DC voltage 100 V with the switching
frequency fC = 5 kHz. It is noted that all the SPWM techniques considered show
almost similar performance. It can be observed that 60° clamp PWM with RL load
gives best harmonic performance at modulation indices close to unity. The hard-
ware in loop switched capacitor multilevel inverter has been simulated and veriﬁed
using DSP microcontroller TMS320F240. The MOSFETs utilized in the prototype
are IRFP250N with in-built bypass diodes. The experimental prototype is given an
input supply of 15 V and the switching frequency of 1 kHz operating at an output
phase frequency of 50 Hz with the load parameters R = 10 X and L = 12 mH.
Figures 3 and 4 show the experimental results of the switched capacitor inverter for
both PD and Bus clamping techniques.

Switching and conduction losses in SCMLI are compared for SPWM and bus
clamping modulation methods at different modulation indexes and are shown in
Fig. 5. It is inferred that in comparison with SPWM techniques, bus clamping
modulation has reduced switching losses due to clamping of the phase to the peak
value as stated in Sect. 3. It is nearly 30% reduction in switching losses noted for
bus clamping 60° modulation when compared to SPWM strategies. It is observed
that for a given topology, bus clamping strategy has slightly increased conduction
losses when compared to other techniques at higher modulation indexes. This is due
to high value of fundamental current at the output drawn from the source.

Conclusion
Switched capacitor unit has an advantage of boosting the input voltage without the
use of transformer and hence ﬁnds the motivation for the work to study the per-
formance of the unit with different switching techniques. The most popular and
simple SPWM technique has been compared with the bus clamping technique.
From both simulation and experimental results, it is observed that all the SPWM
techniques show almost similar performance and the bus clamping technique
reduces the harmonic distortion in comparison with SPWM techniques at higher
modulation indices. It is further noted that bus clamping technique has reduced the
switching losses in the output voltage waveform with the increase in the funda-
mental value of the voltage. Bus clamping technique results in approximately ten
percent reduction in THD, and about one-third of the switching losses reduced than
that of the SPWM techniques.

Estimation and Modeling of Underwater
Acoustic Sensor Network
Jyotsna W. Chavhan and G.G. Sarate
Abstract Underwater wireless communication is a rapidly growing area of
research and engineering. The acoustic channel used for propagating the underwater
data from transmitter to receiver was having formidable challenges like slow
transmission of data, prescribed bandwidth, varying transmission delay, and many
more, which gives multipath fading and Doppler effect. Here, we present the
underwater acoustic sensor network designed for two underwater wireless sensor
nodes which transmit their data using acoustic link from one node to another. The
acoustic link between transmitter and receiver is established for underwater data
transmission. Acoustic link is having its own limitations like noise interference
which is common in acoustic signal, transmission losses increases, time-varying
multi-path transmission, Doppler spread is limited, bandwidth is limited up to
certain distance, and also it provides high transmission delay. But waves under the
water are scattered and propagate very slow which produces the propagation delay
in it. Therefore, to overcome these issues, the acoustic channel is particularly
modeled based on Gaussian distribution, where the delay varies with time rapidly.
As acoustic signal get scattered in almost all directions under the water and it
increases fading problem, Doppler spread, Doppler shift and Doppler delay, etc.
The orthogonal frequency division multiplexing technique is used to overcome the
problem of scattering by using the method called maximum entropy modeling. In
this method, the delay between transmitting signal and received signal has been
calculated referred as Doppler spread. It also calculates the bit transmitted rate and
bit error rate by diving the channel into sub-channels using OFDM. The proposed
system is designed and tested for shallow water using two tested nodes. The
low-cost sensor nodes are designed which can continuously read the data like
temperature, pressure, and salinity below the water, and it can then be transmitted to
the receiver which is also kept under the water. The receiver receives the data and

Introduction
Nowadays, researchers and scientists are doing their research work for underwater
areas, which is the growing and emerging ﬁeld for them. Underwater data are
required for many applications like weather forecasting, hazard monitoring, and
seaquake monitoring; oceanic data are required for seismic monitoring and many
more. This can be possible by developing an underwater communication network
by designing certain sensor nodes which can continuously read the underwater data
and transfer it to the base station. In this research paper, underwater acoustic sensor
network (UWASN) is designed to monitor the underwater data continuously with
the help of sensors. The proposed system is designed and tested for shallow water
condition using two tested nodes. The low-cost sensor nodes are designed which
can continuously read the data like temperature, pressure, and salinity below the
water, and it can then be transmitted to the receiver which is also kept under the
water; then the received data are transmitted to the base station (laptop), which is
kept above the water or nearby sea coastal region which actually continuously
monitor the received data. This process demonstrates the vertical and horizontal
communication link. Here, the underwater acoustic channel is modeled using
maximum entropy modeling technique which calculates the Doppler spread that is
0.5–2 Hz only. Here, the acoustic channel satisﬁes the smart antenna approach by
using IEEE standard 802.15.4, which gives the data transmission rate up to
250 kbps at 2.4 GHz carrier frequency for at least 2 m vertical link and approxi-
mately 10 m horizontal link, by keeping the depth of water up to 1.5 m.
The system is tested in a 25 m  13 m (i.e. 325 m2) swimming pool with
1–1.5 m depth. Therefore, the acoustic channel is also estimated based on shallow
water conditions, since shallow water acoustic communication is consider. For this,
the bandwidth was kept up to 2.4 GHz. Here, 16–64 sub-carriers are created with
312.5  10 + 3 sub-carrier spacing at the frequency of 3.6 MHz, and each
sub-carriers are made to process 256 bits per sub-channel. Thus, the smart under-
water acoustic communication system can be designed with fast communication
and less power consumption.

Here in this work, we have designed a sensor node based on Fig. 1 as a transmitting
node and Fig. 2 as the receiving node. The transmitting node reads the data like
temperature, pressure, and salinity of water and transmits it to the receiving node
using acoustic link. The design node is having some common speciﬁc parameters
like (1) input power unit; (2) processing unit; (3) various sensors; (4) smart

frequency of 2.4 GHz at the speed of 250 kbps. Initially, we made wired con-
nection between underwater receiver node and to the base station; later on, we
convert that into complete wireless solution.

Underwater Acoustic Channel Modeling
The acoustic channel creates various issues like transmission loss, includes noise,
multipath fading, Doppler effects, and propagation delay. These issues determine
the temporarily and spatially varying signal of the acoustic channel based on both
the factors like bandwidth and frequency. Thus, this factor creates the refracting
effect while reading the underwater data of temperature, pressure, and salinity based
on the sound speed rather than the light speed. The sound speed is less than the light
speed which is within the range of 1450–1540 m/s [1]. Thus, these factors are
solved in this research paper, which gives signiﬁcant values of bit error rate, data
transmission rate, transmission delay, noise factor, etc.
3.1
Propagation Delay
The reading parameters like temperature, pressure, and salinity vary with the
variation of speed of sound in water. As per the research, the temperature and
pressure are almost constant near the surface of water, and the temperature
decreases while pressure increases with depth of water. After certain level of depth,
the temperature reaches a constant level of 4 °C, and from there, the speed of sound
increases with depth [2]. Here Eq. (1) shows the calculation of speed of sound in
water.

where t is temperature in degree Celsius, s is the salinity; whereas d is the depth of

where s is time in seconds and l is distance in meters.

3.2
Absorption Coefﬁcient
Absorption coefﬁcient is an another important factor for acoustic channel. It
increases rapidly with increases in frequency as shown in Fig. 3. For this case, the
transmitting frequency is 2.4 GHz; therefore, the maximum signal gets attenuated
due to high range of frequency, which reduces using the Eq. (3) denoted by a,
which is plotted in the form of graph in Fig. 3. In this plot, the absorption coefﬁ-
cient factor reduces due to maximum entropy method for the frequency range about
2.4 GHz. This is already been explained properly in [3]. Here in this case, the
acoustic channel was designed and tested for swimming pool where the depth of
water was 1 m, and the transmitter and receiver were kept apart from each other
around 10 m; therefore, the absorption coefﬁcient was calculated as shown in the
equation below, and its result is shown in Fig. 3.

Underwater Acoustic Channel Estimation
Once the acoustic channel was modeled, it needs to estimate properly based on the
designed condition. Here, the channel estimation was done, where various factors
were considered along with signal-to-noise ratio, bit error rate, and optimal fre-
quency utilization. The channel to be modeled in such a way that it should be
considered for maximum energy allocation within the speciﬁed frequency band, so
that the channel capacity is maximized [3]. The results that are assessed suggest
that despite the fact that frequency spectrum [4, 5] for underwater acoustic

communications, the possibilities in terms of usable frequency bands are not
numerous, due to acoustic path propagation and noise characteristics [6].
4.1
SNR and SER
The signal-to-noise ratio identiﬁes the signiﬁcance of maximum signal received at
the receiving end over the distance of 10 m at a frequency of 2.4 GHz, which can
be calculated as shown in Eq. (3). In this equation, the transmitted power will be
provided as the input power and the amplitude-to-noise ratio can be calculated; its
resultant value is provided in the given Eq. (4):
SNRðl; f Þ ¼ Pðf Þ
A l; f
ð
Þ
Nf Df
ð4Þ
where P(f) is the transmitted power at the given frequency f, A the amplitude of the
transmitted signal at the given frequency f travels at l m distance, N is the noise
added into the received signal at the frequency f, and ﬁnally Df is a narrow fre-
quency band. Figures 4 and 5 show the resultant graph of SNR and BER.
4.2
Optimal Frequency
Figure 5 shows the BER of the data transmission reduces as the frequency of the
transmitted signal varies from MHz to GHz. Here, we used the ZigBee module
Fig. 4 SNR with BER
436
J.W. Chavhan and G.G. Sarate

using XBee protocol for wireless transmission between transmitter and receiver.
This module can work for wide range of frequency from MHz to GHz. Based on its
system design and particular nodes, the frequency band is selected for maximum
data transmission [7]. Thus, as per Fig. 5, the AN product is used for calculating the
product for each distance of l m which can provide the maximum narrow band SNR
at the receiver end for the optimized frequency f. Therefore, while implementing a
wireless sensor communication system, a proper transmission bandwidth needs to
be chosen so that the transmission power is adjusted for achieving the desired SNR
throughout the selected frequency band. Practically, the response of the Doppler
effect and noise generated using ﬁltering processes of swimming pool was con-
sidered, and optimal transmission frequency was considered.
4.3
Channel Estimation
The designed system is based on 802.15.4 used for ZigBee technique which uses
XBee protocol for data transmission using OFDM approach. The data get scattered
under the water; therefore, OFDM technique is used; in this method, data are
transmitted using the number of sub-carriers with uniform data transmission rate,
and the frequency band is sub-divided into these channels. In Xbee-based systems,
the IEEE 802.15.4 standard is used for data transmission between the nodes, where
the transmission channel is based on OFDMA, which is a multiuser multicarrier
modulation technique, in which the channel is divided into number of sub-channels
which is used to share the data between several users. The bandwidth of 2.4 GHz
scaled is sub-divided into 64 sub-channels each with a frequency of approximately
37.5 MHz [1]. All these sub-channels are correspondingly used to transmit the data

from underwater transmitter to receiver by keeping the OFDM symbol duration at
3.2 ls. In this coding technique, Doppler spread was calculated as 0.5–2 Hz using
IEEE standard 802.15.4, and delay spread was around 1 ms (Figs. 6 and 7).
4.4
A Smart Antenna Approach
In this proposed system, we used micro-strip antenna for fast and efﬁcient trans-
mission at the data transmission rate 250 kbps using 2.4 GHz frequency band. To
support this antenna, IEEE standard 802.15.4 XBee is also used which actually
providing the transmission rate up to 250 kbps. The use of smart antenna helps us to
reduce the power consumption at every stage of transmission. The maximum power

require to transmit any data from transmitter to receiver is not more than 0.3459 J. The
same power consumption can also be simulated for 25 numbers of nodes using 64
sub-carriers, each used 256 bits at 25.6 MHz frequency to transmit using MC-ESE
algorithm. Therefore, the simulated results for the system are shown in Table 1.

Conclusion
Therefore, here we are concluding that the underwater acoustic sensor network is
designed using two underwater low-cost homemade sensors. The nodes can
transmit the data from the transmitter to the receiver using acoustic channel at the
frequency of 2.4 GHz. The system is simulated, and corresponding results are
shown in Table 1. Here the designed system was tested in swimming pool of
325 m2 dimension, where the depth was kept as 1 m and the distance between the
nodes was around 10 m maximum. The system was transmitting the data at the
range of 250 kbps using XBee protocol of ZigBee module, which actually using for
underwater data transmission. The underwater acoustic communication channel is
designed using maximum entropy modeling technique by selecting acoustic
channel simulation and performing root mean square. Doppler spread is 0.5–2 Hz.
The acoustic communication channel satisﬁes smart antenna approach by using
IEEE standard 802.15.4 which gives the data transmission rate up to 250 kbps at
2.4 GHZ carrier frequency for at least 2 m vertical communication link and
approximately 2 m horizontal link by keeping the depth of water up to 1 m, since
shallow water acoustic communication is consider. For this, the bandwidth was kept
up to 2.4 GHz. The system can generate the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
that is up to 1.477 dB, and its signal-error-rate (SER) is calculated as −14.9513 dB.

Abstract For general image sensing applications in avionics, it is necessary to
keep the line of sight (LOS) of the sensor insensitive to the carrier’s body rates.
Such application requirement necessitates the usage of an inertial stabilized plat-
form (ISP). Any ISP generally consists of a two- or three-axis gimbal system with
the payload, i.e., sensors or cameras on the inner gimbal. The dynamics of such a
system are complicated, and it is a difﬁcult task to attain the objective of stabi-
lization. Parameter estimation techniques are used to derive a state space model of
the gimbal system dynamics from the experimented data or design data of the
gimbal system. In this paper, a state space model is estimated using a prediction
error method for a cross-coupled two-axis inertial stabilization platform and the
results of both cross-coupled and state space estimation method are compared. The
model satisﬁes the characteristics of the original system for a required frequency
range.

Introduction
Every image sensing and target tracking application requires an image processing
device which is supposed to follow and track the target with high precision. Such
devices are generally placed on moving vehicles which cause disturbances in the line
of sight (LOS) of sensor and also degrade the quality of the image. Inertial stabilized
platforms (ISP) are employed for the purpose of decoupling the movement of the
body from the sensor’s LOS [1]. The sensor will be placed in the inner elevation
gimbal, and they are carried by the outer azimuth gimbal. The dynamics of such a
structure are derived using Newton’s second law or Lagrange equations [2, 3]. These
equations are hard to derive if one assumes a dynamic mass imbalance in the system.
Several papers have been published on gimbal dynamics assuming a linear and
balanced system, but did not account for the dynamic mass unbalance which would
occur once the body starts rotating [4]. A single axis gimbal which explained the
single axis ISP well, but could not extend it to a multiaxis gimbal system is presented
in [5]. If one assumes all the nonlinearities present in the system like friction torque or
cable restraint torque to be linear or nonexistent, then the derived equations of motion
will be an approximation of the actual systems dynamics and not exact [6]. Hence, for
such complicated systems one may revert to system identiﬁcation and parameter
estimation techniques. This requires one to perform an experiment or a series of
experiments on the actual system and then estimate a model of the system which, due
to the advances in computational techniques and computing devices, will give a more
accurate model than that obtained mathematical derivation. The motive behind
implementing the parameter estimation techniques is to make the ISP system simple
by the virtue of mathematical complexity so as to achieve better tuning of the
controllers. In addition to that adopting the prediction error method attain that pur-
pose better than subspace algorithms and facilitates improved understanding of the
gimbal dynamics [7]. System identiﬁcation was used to ﬁnd the state space model of
the gimbal dynamics, but a balanced gimbal system assumed thereby reducing the
complexity of it [8]. Here, an unbalanced gimbal system is modeled and simulated.
Then, its parameters are estimated using the prediction error estimation method.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a derivation of the gimbal
dynamics based on Newton’s laws of motion and Lagrange’s equations, and then
dynamic unbalance and kinematic coupling are explained. Section 3 gives a brief
introduction about system identiﬁcation and parameter estimation using which a state
space model has been derived. The obtained state space representation is then simulated
giving the same signal as the original model and the two responses are compared.

Gimbal Dynamics
The two-axis gimbal is considered as shown in Fig. 1. It is placed on the main body
via shock absorbers, and the outer gimbal is the azimuth gimbal and the inner
gimbal is the elevation gimbal [1]. The sensor is placed on the inner gimbal, and its

velocities in y and z direction are measured with the help of a rate gyro placed on
the elevation gimbal. Three sets of coordinate frames are attached to each of the
body, azimuth and elevation gimbals, (i, j, k) to the body, (n, e, k) to the outer
gimbal, and (r, e, d) to the inner gimbal with A representing the inner gimbal, by

Kinetic Coupling
In the above equations, the terms of the type Are, Ard, Ade denote the inertia terms of
the respective gimbals with respect to two axes and are called as products of inertia.
Such terms are zero for symmetrical bodies. In addition to the asymmetrical nature
of the ISP, angular coupling between the two channels is also present, meaning that
the angular motion with respect to one axis disrupts the position of the LOS with

Parameter Estimation Using Prediction Error Method
Parameter estimation and system identiﬁcation are two concepts with the same
procedure of calculation with disguised goals or applications. The latter gives a
model that explains the system’s responses, while the former also gives a vector
containing the parameters of the system. Since the advent of computers, this has
become quite achievable. So to obtain the mathematical model of the gimbal system
without manually deriving the entire equations, one can adopt one of the above
processes depending on their application. The MATLAB System Identiﬁcation tool
is used here, which can give a linear (transfer function or state space) or a nonlinear
model of a system. The block named cross in Fig. 2 contains the equations derived
in Sect. 2. The cross-coupled block is connected to actuate motors, one each for
elevation and azimuth channels. By applying system identiﬁcation toolbox, the
cross-coupled block is to be replaced by an estimated model in order retain system
characteristics.
To ﬁnd the state space model for the gimbal system using prediction error
method, in which the past inputs, outputs, and tries to predict the future output.
A parameter vector has kept updating based on the error in the predicted value for
every iteration. It is an iterative procedure using a gradient search algorithm. This
method computes the parameters of the model from complex transfer function into
the state space model to pertain its original characteristics. The system identiﬁcation
toolbox in MATLAB is used to obtain the state space model of the gimbal system
The original model was simulated initially under excitation with random signal
as inputs and the system’s response to it are sampled into the toolbox. Using indent
commands, the data appear in the working data box and the required operation
performed. This model is validated in the toolbox by choosing the model order of
estimation. The procedure is repeated more types of inputs to incorporate the
characteristics of the original system. More the number of experiments tends to
guaranteed for the valid mode. So higher sample number, then the goodwill be the
estimated model.

Simulation and Results
The two case studies are estimated with different inputs using system identiﬁcation
toolbox and obtained estimated model and are shown below. Both the original and
estimated models are tested with the same input, i.e., unit step and corresponding
output signals are observed in each case for elevation, yaw channels and their
position, stabilization loops.

is that to simplify the system to enhance the tuning procedure of the controller
without any approximations.

Conclusion
The cross-coupled model obtained by considering all nonlinearities of the inertial
stabilization platform is more complex in nature, and it is very difﬁcult to determine
the parameters of PID controllers for two channels. Parameter optimization block
facilitates the same characteristics of cross-coupled model with less complexity in
tuning the position loop and stabilization loop controllers. This approach is iden-
tical for any two-axis gimbal systems with various sets of parameters. The
parameter estimated model retains all characteristics of the original physical system.

Simple FOPI Tuning Method
for Real-Order Time Delay Systems
Utkal Mehta, Vincent Lechappe and Om Prakash Singh
Abstract Fractional-order controllers (FOC) can be more adequate to control
systems with complex dynamics than integer-order controllers; however, how to
obtain FOC is still being explored vigorously. This paper deals with a tuning
approach for FOC with primary requirements of simplicity in technique and
robustness. A simple analytical method to tune fractional-order proportional-
integral (FOPI) controller for known system transfer functions is proposed. Study
shows the simplicity and efﬁciency of the presented design method over some
previously published approaches.

Introduction
There are many techniques for PID tuning, classical rules, optimization programs,
model-based tuning, and many other tested in industry so far [1]. Even though the
PID is simple, many challenge to tune the controller parameters practically.
Recently, real-order PID controller design shows considerable interest in academic
research and industry [2–8]. This is mainly due to the fact that real-order transfer for
controller can better represent the various systems of engineering and sciences [1].
In general, real-order transfer function considered for PID is called the

fractional-order PID (FOPID) controller. Moreover, it is evident from signiﬁcant
research that FOC have additional merits of handling complex system dynamics
compared to conventional PID. After inducing the concept of FOPID controller in
[1], a stabilization problem of fractional systems using FOPID controllers was also
studied by Hamamci [9]. Especially, due to the computational tool such as
FOMCON toolbox [10] available, design veriﬁcation of real-order transfer function
is possible in Simulink study. Literature study shows that number of design
approaches have been reported to suggest good FOPID parameter values. Some
methods were applied successfully in many practical non-integer examples such as
control of hard disk drive servo systems, control of power electronic converters,
velocity control of a servo system, control of composite hydraulic cylinders, and
control of head ﬂow. All previous techniques experience certain limitations, such as
to solve simultaneously two or more nonlinear algebraic relations to calculate the
unknown parameters of FOPID. However, in this way, there is a possibility to place
the non-optimum solution if pitiable guess of initial values is used.
In this work, an effort is made to develop explicit tuning method for FOPI
controller considering the real-order dead time systems. In this way, the proposed
method can be applied to integer and fractional systems also. The objective is to
derive simple and fast tuning formula that industry can adopt easily for various PID
tune-controlled systems. The main objective is to design parameters of FOPI such
that it optimizes load disturbance rejection. The exact formula is derived with
required constraint imposed on the Nyquist curve. The loop transfer function of
closed-loop must, therefore, satisfy robustness index.

number order, the transfer function is also called “fractional-order.” It includes, in
particular, traditional integer-order time delay systems.

FOPI Controller
It is well-known that PI controller is most simple and widely tested relatively in
industry [1, 11]. There are many reﬁned control techniques such as model pre-
dictive control and Smith predictor and are developed on PI. In this paper, the FOPI
is considered as fractional-order controller and can be represented as C(s) to show
the proposed controller synthesis effectively.
C ¼
Kp þ Ki
sk

ð2Þ
where Kp, Ki and k are the positive real tuning parameters. The real number k
represents the fractional-order.
3.1
Design and Tuning
Any control design wants to realize decent load disturbance rejection and also to
robust from parameter variations. We desire to have tuning rules of controller be
simple and still result in good closed-loop behavior. Based on robustness speciﬁ-
cations, such as gain margin, phase margin, and maximum sensitivity, many
classical PI/PID tuning methods were developed and also quite well adopted in the
practice [1]. Generally it is possible to change the system characteristics of
G jx
ð
Þs¼jx in (1) such that the overall closed-loop system performs ﬁne. How can
we say the system’s performance is up to the satisfaction? When the effect of load
disturbances will be less and it must be stable always whenever moderate changes
in system parameters. In general, it is desired to choose C(s) tuning parameters so
the system under controlled is not disturbed with variations in system dynamics.
A study tells that this requirement can be obtained via sensitivity speciﬁcation.
A sensitivity problem for same purpose was discussed in [11]. According to deﬁned
speciﬁcation for sensitivity, the system remains stable to variations in system
dynamics if the robustness is speciﬁed by:

where, GLðsÞ ¼ GðsÞCðsÞ. Figure 1 shows the geometrical illustration of the above

imaginary axis and the Nyquist curve of GL(jx), and it is measured from the
left-half of the complex plane. Moreover, a speciﬁcation in (3) turns out to be
sufﬁcient condition for designing a controller.

Here, @A=@x and @B=@x are denoted by A0ðxÞ and B0ðxÞ in the rest of the
paper. Now, for given x and k, both Kp and Ki can be estimated from two
expressions (8) and (9). Hence, the complete region of the parameters can also be
generated for 0\x\1 and 0\k\2. Obviously, any arbitrary set (Kp, Ki, k) will
satisfy the condition in (6) and also follows the relation

ð10Þ
By stating that each set is not unique to a given value of Mr. The task is remained
to ﬁnd the optimal set (Kp, Ki, k) while it satisﬁes the Mr constraint. In addition, the
value of Mr can be set up as suitable trade-offs between performance and robustness
in any given dynamic models.
In order to estimate the optimal set of (Kp, Ki, k) and given Mr, we need to know
the optimal point of frequency x. For this, the well-known integrated error criterion
can be used, deﬁned by
IE ¼
Z1

eðtÞdt
ð11Þ
Here, the unit step input gives the error e(t). In [1], it shows that the value of IE is
directly related to the controller parameters, i.e., IE = 1/Ki. Thus, the controller
parameters can be calculated by maximizing Ki (to reduce the error quickly) subject to
requirements (6) and (7). So, the expressions (8) and (9) deﬁne subtly Ki as a function
of Kp and k. One can write the derivative function to ﬁnd maximum of this function as
df ¼ @f
@Kp
dKp þ @f
@Ki
dKi þ @f
@k dk þ @f
@x dx

It is obvious that Ki is maximum to have the condition satisﬁes dKi = 0. Same
way for Kp, one can formulate the relationship as

to relate third controller parameter k in terms of measured system frequency x90.

Choice of Mr
The choice of Mr provides us desirable property of closed-loop system to be
insensitive with parameter variations. The controller parameters will vary
depending on the changes of Mr, but the system will always remain stable. To
understand this point further, let us take the fractional-order system with transfer

Mr ¼ 1:5 observed oscillatory with a larger overshoot but faster. This indicates that
Mr value can be useful to tune parameter values. Note that Mr value is also to be
decided based on the stability margin. A large value of Mr indicates that the
stability margin of the control system is high. Obviously, it is desirable in system
control at the time to design any controller values.

for the system frequency x90 ¼ 1:7191. For comparison with other methods,
responses to a unity setpoint change and disturbance of +0.2 at t = 20 s are given in

controller could obtain smaller control effort with small overshoot and settling time.
The total variation in control input was measured as 2.12 for [8] and 2.21 for [7];
while that for the proposed method was measured only 1.87. The merit of the
proposed method is visible since it gives the desired properties with less control
input effort. Moreover, the percentage overshoot was measured 2.82 and 5.89 for
[7] and [8], respectively.

Conclusion
This paper presents a general FOPI design method for any order transfer function
with various dynamics, including with and without time delays, low and high real
orders. The method uses the integrated error criterion with a desired robustness
speciﬁcation and solves for the FOPI controller parameters in the frequency
domain. Explicit tuning rules succeed for various real-order systems with a single
robustness parameter to be selected by the user. This investigation helps to explore
online automatic tuning procedure for fractional controller which is very attractive
in a practical point of view.

Particle Swarm Optimization-Based
Closed-Loop Optimal State Feedback
Control for CSTR
Geetha Mani, Natarajan Sivaraman and P. Sanjeevikumar
Abstract Complete state vector information is necessary for implementing the
state feedback control via algebraic Riccati equation (ARE). However, all the states
are usually not available for feedback because it is often expensive and impractical
to include a sensor for each variable. Hence, to estimate the unmeasured variables, a
state estimation technique is formulated to estimate all the states of the process. One
of the major problems of closed-loop optimal control design is the choice of
weighted matrices, which will result in optimal response. The conventional
approach involves trial-and-error method to choose the weighted matrices in the
cost function to determine the state feedback gain. Some of the drawbacks of this
method are as follows: it is tedious, time-consuming, optimal response is not
obtained, and manual selection of weighting matrices is also not straightforward. To
overcome the above shortcomings, swarm intelligence is used to obtain the optimal
weights, which provide superior performance than the conventional trial-and-error
approach. The proposed approach performance is assessed by weight selection
using PSO, which is compared with manual tuning that satisﬁes the closed-loop
stability criteria. Further, the proposed controller performance is evaluated not only
for stabilizing the disturbance rejection, but also for tracking the given reference
temperature in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR).

Introduction
The challenge involved to design an optimal state feedback controller by means of
LQR is selecting matrices Q and R that should satisfy both the design criteria and
the reduction in control effort. Conventionally, trial-and-error method is being
followed to ﬁnd the weighting matrices, but optimal response is not obtained with
this type of search. Therefore, to overcome the difﬁculty in selecting weighting
matrices of LQR, in the last decade, few approaches using evolutionary algorithms
for optimization were reported [1]. In the existing literature, the control design is
considered by using evolutionary algorithms and these methods do not require
explicit gradient information for optimization. Outlines the evolutionary algorithm
in control engineering aspect [2].
In particular, by using genetic algorithms (GAs), the problem with pole place-
ment was solved carefully, formulating it as multi-objective optimization problem
[3]. Recently, it was found that tuning the PI and PID controllers using particle
swarm optimization (PSO) method improves the response time. Further, PSO also
outperforms other evolutionary algorithms like GAs. It also became a reliable tool
for control optimization problem [4].
In [5], for model-based predictive control (MBPC) application to determine the
optimal control sequence, EAs were used. In particular, the focus is on nonlinear
systems that have constrained input. To avoid the infeasibility, specialized genetic
coding and operators were developed. Favorable results were obtained for long
control horizons by applying the resulting scheme in a simulated batch-fed
fermenter.
Tsai et al. [6] proposed the controller design for automatic ﬁghter tracking
problems using the variable feedback gain based on PSO, in which the performance
of the PSO-based LQR was proved to be better than the LMI-based LQR for the
automatic ﬁghter tracking applications. Solihin and Akmeliawati [7] proposed
employing PSO for optimizing the stabilizing controller design via LQR applied for
an inverted pendulum and designed stabilizing controller for a single inverted
pendulum using LQR. Then, the gains of the LQR are chosen by minimizing the
objective function via PSO. Proposed methodology is given in the next section.
Section 3 is about the discussion on simulation results followed by the conclusion
given in Sect. 4.

Weighting matrices Qo and Ro play a vital role in optimization. Its compositions
have a larger impact on the system performance [3]. The number of matrix elements
in Qo and Ro depends on state variable and the input variable. Let the numbers in
diagonal-off is considered to be zero. Then, the quadratic performance index is
weighted ISE of the states and inputs if the diagonal matrices are chosen. The
trial-and-error approach is simpler which makes the designers to select the Qo and
Ro matrices without restriction. On the other hand, selection process is very tedious

because it involves iteration and time-consuming process and requires suitable
experience and also awareness about the physical problem. Further, it iterates for a
very long time to ﬁnd the best value for the elements in Qo and Ro matrices.
Thus, by employing the PSO technique, the above problem could be averted. It
ﬁnds the optimum solution for the LQG. The obtained solution is used to minimize
difference between the reference input and actual process variable. Flowchart for
weight selection of LQG based on PSO algorithm is shown in Fig. 2. Particles in PSO
represent the diagonal elements of Qo and Ro matrices, and the elements are chosen to
be positive real. Firstly, the position and velocity of the particles are initialized, and for
each particle, the solution of Riccati equation is found. It is followed by calculating the
corresponding feedback gain matrix. The ﬁtness of each particle is calculated using
the current position value. By using the integral square error (ISE), the ﬁtness value is
calculated. The position is updated by comparing the present ISE value with the
previous best ISE value. If it is found to beless, then the current values are set as best pi,
otherwise the current ISE value is retained. Among all the particles, whichever is
having minimum ISE value is selected as a global best pg.

Formulation of Fitness Function
In order to arrive at the proper global optimal solution, formulation of the ﬁtness
function is essential. It decides on convergence rate. Integral of the square error
(ISE), integral of the time-weighted absolute error (ITAE), and integral of the
absolute error (IAE) are some of the commonly used ﬁtness functions to design
controllers. The ﬁtness function used in this paper is ISE, and it is given in (14)

Comparative Analysis on Simulation Performed
Linearized state space model of CSTR is used for simulation purpose in all process.
Feed temperature, feed ﬂow, and concentration are assumed to be constants.
Manipulated input variable is given as a coolant ﬂow rate. Reactor concentration
and temperature are taken as state variables. The open-loop poles of CSTR system
are −2.39 + 3.03i and −2.39 −3.03i. The system is stable and satisﬁes both
controllable and stabilizable conditions. The pair [state matrix (A), output matrix
(C)] is measurable. The stability of closed-loop system is guaranteed by the
C matrix where C is CTC = Q. So, the tuning parameter values of LQG controller
are found out using manual tuning (trial-and-error method) selected as Qo = Diag{1
1} and Ro = 1 to satisfy the closed-loop stability.
The tuning parameters of Kalman ﬁlter preferred are the following:
Process noise covariance matrix Q = Diag{0.0025, 0.0025}
Measurement noise covariance matrix R = 0.0025
Initial state error covariance matrix P = 1000I(22).
PSO Parameters:
Swarm size: 100; number of generations: 400; cognitive acceleration constant:
c1 = 1.3
Social acceleration constant: c2 = 1.3; inertia weight wmin ¼ 0:4, wmax ¼ 1:1
Distribution range [0 1] and [1 10]
The simulation under both set point tracking and regulatory control was performed
based upon the situation that would be on reality.
Case 1: Set point Tracking
The objective of the controller is to track the temperature, which is given as set
point irrespective of disturbances prevailing in the process by properly adjusting

coolant ﬂow rate. The corresponding state feedback gain is determined using LQG
whose weighting matrices are tuned in ofﬂine by PSO and manual tuning.
Table 1 shows the tuning parameters used for manual method and PSO (two
different distributions) optimization methods along with the state feedback gain
matrix, set point gain function for tracking application, and closed-loop eigenvalues
of the system. From Fig. 3, it could be observed that the closed-loop eigenvalues of
the system tuned via PSO in the search interval [1 10] are located comparatively far
from the imaginary axis, which suggest that the stability of the system is improved.
Simulation result in Fig. 4 shows that the proposed PSO-based optimal control
approach tracks the set point better when compared to trial-and-error approach. The
output variation of the controller (coolant ﬂow rate) for servoresponse is shown in
Fig. 5.
In order to assess the performance of the controller, the integral square error is
calculated between desired set point temperature and actual output temperature for
all the three methods and the observation is given in Table 2. The value of ISE in

methods. It has no offset, exactly tracking the set point variation. The EKF esti-
mates the concentration of the reactor based on measured temperature value.

In regulatory control, the temperature and concentration of reactor state variable

initial transients. Integral square error between the actual and estimated variables is
chosen as a performance index to evaluate the performance of the controller.
Table 3 shows the PSO in search interval [0 1] gives least ISE value in both the
state variables (temperature and concentration). Figure 8 shows the coolant ﬂow
variation in closed loop. The estimated value of concentration is shown in Fig. 9.
So, PSO in the search interval [0 1] gives optimal tuning parameters of the
system in both servo and regulatory mode.

results. Further, the stability is improved in terms of both set point tracking and

Design of a Piezoresistive
Microaccelerometer with High Sensitivity
for Medical Diagnostic
Sonali Biswas and Anup Kumar Gogoi
Abstract The design of a piezoresistive microaccelerometer and its performance
analysis have been presented in this paper. The objective is to design a tremor
diagnostic system operating at frequency range from 0.1 to 25 Hz and ±2 g. In this
paper, mainly the analysis has been done based on the temperature effect, drift, and
doping. The microaccelerometer designed has been simulated using the ﬁnite ele-
ment method-based software COMSOL 4.3 with the following dimensions; proof
mass: 3200  3200  250, ﬂexure: 1000  250  20, frame: 5200  230  250,
piezoresistor: 100  25  2 (all dimensions are in lm). Here basically, the impact
of strain on the temperature and doping has been studied. Sensitivity is dependent
upon the piezoresistive coefﬁcient; therefore, the temperature and the doping con-
centration have a direct impact upon the sensitivity of the device. The designed
microaccelerometer has a sensitivity of 10.5 mV/V/g, and Wheatstone bridge is
employed as the signal pickup circuit to reduce the cross-axis sensitivity.

High-performance MEMS accelerometer in terms of sensitivity, resolution, and low
noise ﬂoor is still an active area of research. In this paper, the design of a piezoresistive
microaccelerometer operating from 0.1 to 25 Hz and the performance analysis of the
same have been done for obtaining high sensitivity. Several neurodegenerative dis-
eases cause tremor in patients and are characterized by a rhythmic roughly sinusoidal
oscillatory movement ranging from 0.1 to 25 Hz. Therefore, MEMS accelerometer is
used to measure the tremor, namely rest, kinetic, and postural operating with maxi-
mum acceleration amplitude of ±2 g. Piezoresistive accelerometer has high sensi-
tivity, DC response, and easy readout. The disadvantage is that piezoresistors are
highly temperature sensitive and suffer from thermal drift [5]. The piezoresistance
coefﬁcients depend on the doping concentration and temperature [1, 2]. In this paper,
mainly the effect of temperature, offset, and doping has been studied and simulated.
Sections 2–4 describe the effect of strain and the piezoresistive coefﬁcient and
components. In Sect. 5 and its subsections, the simulated results have been given
mainly taking into account the temperature effects and the doping on the response
characteristic and sensitivity characteristic of the sensor output.

Effect of Strain on Piezoresistor
The basic principle of a piezoresistor is given by Eq. (1), where the bulk resistivity
is q, the length (L), and the area (A).
R ¼ qL = A
ð1Þ
From the above equation, we see the resistance value changes with applied strain
in two ways:
1. Dimension
2. Resistivity
The piezoresistors undergo change in resistance when strain is applied and its
behavior is linear as shown in Eq. (2). Here, the dimensional change is negligible
compared to the change in resistivity.
DR=R ¼ GDL=L
ð2Þ
Therefore, gauge factor is
G ¼ DR=R
ð
Þ= DL=L
ð
Þ ¼ DR=eR
ð3Þ
where e is the strain. In the above equation, when we introduce Poisson’s ratio (k)
which is the negative ratio of transverse to axial strain, we get the gauge factor as in
Eq. (4).

As compared to the dimensional change, the resistivity change is larger by a
factor of 50 for a semiconductor, when strain is applied hence we take into account
the change in resistivity. In the above Eq. (4), the ﬁrst two terms occur due to
change in dimension, and the third term occurs due to change in resistivity, dom-
inant for semiconductor gauges.
Hence we get
Gl ¼ plY þ 1 þ 2k

where Gl denotes the longitudinal gauge factor, pl is the piezoresistive coefﬁcient
along longitudinal direction, and Y is the Young’s modulus and is anisotropic with
respect to crystal direction [1].
For semiconductors, we have pl  1 þ 2k therefore using (Y = r1/e) where rl

Piezoresistive Component
Different orientation relative to the crystallographic axis there exist a nonzero
coefﬁcient matrix [P]. Table 2 shows the longitudinal and transverse piezoresistive
coefﬁcient for some typical cases [3, 6].
The piezoresistivity component is shown in Table 3 [3, 6]. The gauge factors for
longitudinal and transverse are given, and we need to calculate according to our
orientation. In our case for the piezoresistive accelerometer designed, ﬁrst the lon-
gitudinal coefﬁcient is calculated for 〈110〉orientation given by (P11 + P12 + P44)/2.
Then, the longitudinal gauge factor is obtained by using Eq. (5), and the change in
resistance to original resistance, i.e., ΔR/R can be obtained using (6).

5.1
Thermal Drift of the Offset Voltage
Piezoresistors are positioned in such a way that maximum stresses can be obtained
for any minimum deﬂection. In our case, four p-doped piezoresistors are placed.
The nature of the accelerometer as an effect of acceleration has been shown in
Table 4 [4]. Initially under perfect equilibrium, the output voltage must be equal to
zero. Due to the effect of temperature, the values of its four resistances will change

and an offset voltage is obtained [4–8]. As the temperature changes are identical in
all the elements, the ratio of their resistance does not change, and hence the output
voltage of the sensing elements does not change. The temperature drift can be
corrected using the full-bridge conﬁguration.
As piezoresistances are temperature sensitive, Wheatstone bridge helps in
eliminating the temperature effect on the output, thereby reducing the cross-axis
sensitivity. The eight piezoresistors connected in a Wheatstone bridge manner is
shown in Fig. 2 [6]. Here, the resistors Rim and Rif in Fig. 1 denote the sensing
element near to the mass and near to the frame, respectively.
5.2
Effect of Temperature on the Sensitivity
Piezoresistive accelerometers are temperature dependent [4]. Even if the acceleration
remains constant, the accelerometer output varies with temperature as reported in
[4]. Temperature coefﬁcient of piezoresistive sensor is of two types; ﬁrst the tem-
perature coefﬁcients of offset (TCO) and second the temperature coefﬁcient of
sensitivity (TCS). The signal pickup circuit we have used here is the Wheatstone
bridge which reduces the offset or the TCO. In our case, the material is silicon, and
based on the amount of doping concentration, the resistivity ranges from 0.1 to

60 Xm. The temperature coefﬁcient of silicon is 0.07/°C. Silicon is a semiconductor
that has the conduction band and the valence band moderately separated. Hence as
the temperature increases, the conductance increases or the resistance decreases. As
resistance is
directly
proportional
to resistivity,
resistivity also decreases.
Considering a variation in temperature, the resistivity is seen to decrease with
increase in temperature as obtained in Fig. 3.
As the piezoresistive coefﬁcients are temperature sensitive, the piezoresistor
sensitivity depends upon the TCS [4]. It is seen that with the increase in temper-
ature, the piezoresistive coefﬁcients decrease and hence the output voltage also
decreases as reported in [4] as given in Fig. 4 [4]. At lower temperature range, we
have higher temperature drift.
5.3
Effect of Doping Concentration on the Sensitivity
Different levels of doping concentration and different types of doping have an
impact upon the piezoresistive coefﬁcients. With an increase in temperature and
doping concentration, the value of the piezoresistive coefﬁcient for p-type and
n-type silicon decreases. As reported in [2], the doping concentration and the
operating temperature have a direct inﬂuence on the longitudinal piezoresistive
coefﬁcient. At constant operating temperature that ranges between −75 and 75 °C,
the piezoresistive coefﬁcient decreases both with the increase in the doping con-
centration and the temperature. When the level of doping is increased, it decreases

the signal output and hence reduces the sensitivity. For our case, we have chosen
p-doped silicon. In intrinsic crystalline silicon, there is approximately 5  1022
atoms/cm. The doping chosen here is p-doped silicon with 5  1017 atoms/cm3.
This speciﬁcation lies in between the typical range for lightly doped that ranges
from 1013/cm3 to 1018/cm3. Continuous increase of doping level leads to the sub-
stantial decrease of the sensitivity. Moreover, it gives the acceptable signal stability
and caters to the desired properties in the device that the semiconductor silicon is
intended for. High doping level at high operating temperature may degrade the
performance of the accelerometer in terms of sensitivity.
5.4
Sensitivity
Considering the p-type single crystal silicon as the piezoresistive sensing element
with orientation 〈110〉, we choose the piezoresistive coefﬁcient, namely P11, P12,
and P44 and obtain the longitudinal coefﬁcient. Considering the bridge input
voltage of 5 V and Young’s modulus of 1.69e11, we obtain the bridge output. The
sensitivity for the ±2 g speciﬁcation has been obtained as 10.5 mv/V/g. The sen-
sitivity has been obtained for various input acceleration due to gravity and has been
plotted in Fig. 5. The plot shows that the dependence of sensitivity on g value is
nonlinear. There is low cross-axis sensitivity due to the Wheatstone bridge pickup
circuit thus enhancing the performance.

Conclusion
A complete study of the temperature effect, offset, doping concentration on the
piezoresistive MEMS accelerometer of ±2 g has been done and simulated for low
cross-axis sensitivity and high-performance medical diagnostic application. The
tremor diagnostic system essentially requires bandwidth ranging from 0.1 to 25 Hz
with dynamic range of ±2 g. The piezoresistive coefﬁcient decreases both with the
increase in the doping concentration and with the increase in temperature. As
sensitivity is dependent upon the piezoresistive coefﬁcient, therefore temperature
and the doping concentration have a direct impact upon the sensitivity of the device.
The sensitivity for the ±2 g speciﬁcation has been obtained as 10.5 mV/V/g.

Recognition of Human Speech Emotion
Using Variants of Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefﬁcients
Hemanta Kumar Palo, Mahesh Chandra
and Mihir Narayan Mohanty
Abstract In this chapter, different variants of Mel-frequency cepstral coefﬁcients
(MFCCs) describing human speech emotions are investigated. These features are
tested and compared for their robustness in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy and
mean square error. Although MFCC is a reliable feature for speech emotion
recognition, it does not consider the temporal dynamics between features which is
crucial for such analysis. To address this issue, delta MFCC as its ﬁrst derivative is
extracted for comparison. Due to poor performance of MFCC under noisy condi-
tion, both MFCC and delta MFCC features are extracted in wavelet domain in the
second phase. Time–frequency characterization of emotions using wavelet analysis
and energy or amplitude information using MFCC-based features has enhanced the
available information. Wavelet-based MFCCs (WMFCCs) and wavelet-based delta
MFCCs (WDMFCCs) outperformed standard MFCCs, delta MFCCs, and wavelets
in recognition of Berlin speech emotional utterances. Probabilistic neural network
(PNN) has been chosen to model the emotions as the classiﬁer is simple to train,
much faster, and allows ﬂexible selection of smoothing parameter than other neural
network (NN) models. Highest accuracy of 80.79% has been observed with
WDMFCCs as compared to 60.97 and 62.76% with MFCCs and wavelets,
respectively.

Introduction
Currently due to involvement of ambiguous and multi-modal expressive behavior,
emotion inference in daily human interaction remains a challenge. Mostly the
emotional expressions are in the form offacial or bodily movements, although speech
is sole medium of emotional expression during telephone conversation. For such
task, detection of emotion arguably remains a challenge. The recognition system
demands extraction of suitable features that can best represent speech emotions.
Among different feature extraction techniques such as prosodic, spectral, voice
quality, nonlinear, MFCC uses frame-based approach and is widely accepted for
speech and emotion analysis [1–3]. Although popular, MFCC feature extraction
process does not involve the temporal dynamics among features that is essential for
emotional analysis. The drawback can be minimized using derivative and acceleration
coefﬁcients of MFCC and has been approached by different researchers [4, 5].
However, MFCC-based features including deltas give information on amplitude and
energy, hence unable to provide adequate information on speech emotion. To improve
the recognition further, multi-resolution capability of wavelet analysis in extracting
MFCC features has been proposed for speaker veriﬁcation [6]. These literatures
suggest for a possibility in enhancement of accuracy if the advantages of both wavelet
analysis and differential MFCC are combined. Hence, a novel effort has been made to
extract the wavelet-based delta MFCC (WDMFCC) features for comparison purpose.
Most classiﬁers used in speech analysis are statistical, NN-based, fuzzy logic,
and combination of these [1–7]. GMM and HMM have the ability to model the
pattern involving large feature sets. Smaller dataset and difﬁculty in modeling the
emotions using conventional statistical classiﬁers such as GMM and HMM have
opened up new avenues for NN-based classiﬁers [7]. As compared to multilayer
perceptron (MLP), PNN is much faster, simpler, easy to implement, and more
accurate [8]. Requirement of only one parameter adjustment and absence of any
constraint in choosing the parameter with precision makes it superior to RBFN.
This
has
motivated

to

for
probabilistic
neural
network
(PNN) classiﬁer in this work.
The organization of the paper is as follows: The feature extraction techniques
and the classiﬁcation model used are explained in Sects. 2 and 3, respectively.
A detailed description on the simulation result with a comparison among the state of
the art and the proposed features is described in Sect. 4. The conclusion and future
research direction are provided in Sect. 5.

Feature Extraction Techniques
Initially, standard features based on wavelet analysis and MFCC are extracted and
compared for their effectiveness in terms of recognition accuracy and mean square
error (MSE). Next to it, delta MFCC features are extracted and compared with the

wavelet-based MFCC and proposed wavelet-based delta MFCC features. The
proposed feature extraction technique is shown in Fig. 1.
2.1
MFCC
One of the most dominant and effective cepstrum-based features is MFCC that uses
a Mel-scale to wrap the original signal frequency into Mel-frequency. This way
both human auditory and hearing mechanism are taken into account since human
ear is logarithmic in nature. The relationship used to convert the windowed signal
frequency f into Mel-frequency fm is given by

Wavelet Analysis
In wavelet analysis, the emotional speech signal sðnÞ is decomposed into approx-
imated and detailed coefﬁcients using a series of low-pass and high-pass ﬁlters,
respectively [9]. For the low-pass ﬁlter having an impulse response hðnÞ, the output
can be represented as a convolution and is given by

Similarly, the output of the high-pass ﬁlter is the convolution of the ﬁlter impulse
response and the signal under consideration. The sub-sampled output of the ﬁlters
by a factor of two can be represented as

MFCC in Wavelet Domain (WMFCC)
The steps of extraction of WMFCC feature are explained below.
(1) Signal decomposition: Initially, decompose the signal into detailed di and
approximation ai coefﬁcients at ith level, respectively. A three-level decom-
position with Daubechies-4 (dB-4) has been performed here. Emotional utter-
ances of Berlin database has been used for this work having a sampling
frequency of 16 kHz. Thus, for 8 kHz bandwidth, the sub-bands are distributed
in the range of 0–1, 1–2, 2–4, and 4–8 kHz due to ﬁltering.
(2) The MFCC feature extraction technique as shown in Fig. 1 is applied indi-
vidually for these sub-bands. Five WMFCCs from each sub-bands of 1–2 and
2–4 kHz and three WMFCCs from each band of 0–1 and 4–8 kHz have been
extracted. More WMFCCs are extracted from the middle bands (1–4 kHz) to
obtain more perceptual information as the speech signal often lies in this band.
The number of WMFCC coefﬁcients obtained this way is reduced to 16
coefﬁcients per utterance.

where MFCCD is the delta features, and to scale the frequency, a value of b ¼ 2 has
been used. N is the number of delta features per utterance, whereas q is the indexing
parameter associated with analyzing window.
2.5
Proposed Wavelet Delta MFCC (WDMFCC)
In the proposed technique, the use of wavelet analysis has provided both time and
frequency information of the signal, while traditional MFCCs provided the energy
or amplitude information. Application of derivatives of MFCC has inducted the
dynamic characteristics with the WMFCC features. The steps of extracting
WDMFCC features are explained below.
a. Extract the wavelet features as explained earlier using Eqs. (3) and (4) as shown
in Fig. 1.
b. Apply the MFCC feature extraction technique to the wavelet features as
explained in WMFCC feature extraction technique.
c. Apply the derivative algorithm as given in Eq. (5) to the WMFCC features to
extract 16 WDMFCC features per utterance of an emotion.

Results and Discussion
Berlin emotional speech database (EMO-DB) [10] has been chosen to distinguish
ﬁve emotional states such as angry, anxiety, happy, sad, and neutral. The utterances
used for training of the classiﬁer are not involved in testing or validation purpose.
Approximately 70% of the data are used for training, and 20% each are used for
testing and validation of every emotional state.
The recognition accuracy using the extracted features with PNN classiﬁer is
given in Table 1. Comparison of the results has gone in favor of WDMFCC as
compared to others. Use of both temporal information due to involvement of

differential values of MFCC and exploration of multi-resolution capability of
wavelet analysis is the prime reason of the accuracy improvement.
Wavelet-based features like WMFCC and WDMFCC are better than delta
MFCC and MFCC features as observed in Table 1. It is found that involvement of
either differential information or wavelet approach in modifying the MFCC
extraction technique has enhanced the robustness of the resultant features as
compared to the standard MFCC or wavelet features.
A comparison of MSE has provided similar results as shown in Fig. 3. It is
found that standard wavelet-based features are more reliable as compared to
MFCCs both in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy and MSE.
To ﬁnd the response time of the classiﬁer with different MFCC features
extracted, the time elapsed both during feature extraction and classiﬁcation has been
compared in Table 2.

Conclusion
There is an improvement in feature reliability involving the differential values of
MFCC coefﬁcients due to inclusion of temporal emotional information. Application
of multi-resolution capability in extraction of MFCC features has resulted more
reliable information than standard MFCC as the classiﬁcation results suggest.
Involvement of both wavelet analysis and differential algorithm used for modiﬁ-
cation of standard MFCC found to be a novel effort in this direction. Other mod-
iﬁcation techniques that can add valuable emotional information to MFCC features
can open up new avenues in the ﬁeld of emotion recognition.

Optimal and Novel Hybrid Feature
Selection Framework for Effective Data
Classiﬁcation
Sivakumar Venkataraman and Rajalakshmi Selvaraj
Abstract Data mining methods are frequently applied in the framework of data
classiﬁcation. Under data mining methods, feature selection (FS) algorithms are
essential for dealing with various dimensional data sets that may contain features in
the range of small, medium, and large dimensions. Handling large number of
features always raises the issues regarding the classiﬁer accuracy and running time.
A novel hybrid feature selection technique build on symmetrical uncertainty and
genetic algorithm is proposed. The experiments’ results on UCI datasets using this
hybrid framework proved that proposed feature selector is efﬁcient through mini-
mizing the volume of initial features and accurate by providing better detection
performance in the classiﬁcation algorithms comparing with other feature selectors
in the literature. It is evident from the earlier research work the prosed method
promotes in optimizing and improves the performance. In summary, the proposed
feature selection method has outperformed other methods in minimizing the
selected features, classiﬁcation performance and reduces the executing time.

Introduction
Data analytics researchers need relevant and high-quality data from huge amount of
stored data. Feature selection method helps in reducing the dimensionality of fea-
tures by removing redundant, irrelevant, or noisy data through which improvisation
in classiﬁcation accuracy with minimum processing of data can be achieved.

Due to increase of dimensionality of records and features in data repositories, there
is shift in maintaining the records related to each and every individual. Formally, in
recent times, data mining techniques are used to discover a novel and useful pattern
from the historical data. Many research ideas are openly still needed to solve this.
Mostly classiﬁcation framework gives an effective result for classifying the data-
sets. Usually, large and high dimensional datasets contain complex information
with errors, and in such a situation, classiﬁcation algorithm plays a vital role.
By using the feature subset selection process, the relevant subset features can be
determined from the original features. The process of ranking features according to
their signiﬁcance in improving the performance of classiﬁers is called as
ranking-based feature selector. Under KDD process, feature selection is only one
essential step that improves the detection performance of the classiﬁers, minimizes
the time taken to build the data mining model, and reduces the number of initial
features because there are no quality features and no quality results in the classiﬁers.
FS methods are classiﬁed as ﬁlter and wrapper method. Based on this key idea,
several FS methods are introduced in machine learning paradigm. Wrapper method
is used to select the features based on the accuracy estimate, and ﬁlter method is
used to select the features not based on the accuracy estimate; rather, it uses the data
characteristics with the relevancy or correlation measures. Filter-based approaches
are not dependent on classiﬁers and usually faster and more scalable than
wrapper-based methods. Moreover, they have low computational complexity too.
Recently, numbers of hybrid approaches are also being proposed to achieve a good
balance in the feature selection criteria by combing both ﬁlter and wrapper method.

In [1], the author discussed the impact of the noise in the class labels by analyzing
the traditional mutual information-based ﬁlter feature selection algorithm. This
proposed idea brings the solution for the nearest neighbors-based entropy estimator
to minimize the class label errors. In [2] the author presents an empirical study on
many feature selection and classiﬁcation algorithms to analyze their performance on
diverse biological datasets. This study reveals combination of RFE with SVM and
LR as best generalization model to perform feature selection and classiﬁcation. In

author proposed genetic algorithm (GA) as commonly used global searches for
optimization. This method is used in feature selection process among various

applications and has exposed to be a good tool [8–12]. A recommended way of
solving this issue is to group genetic algorithm and some memetic (search) oper-
ations [13, 14]. This helps in ﬁne-tuning the search process and improves the
quality of the results generated from genetic algorithm with relation to accuracy and
efﬁciency. Recently, these types of evolutionary algorithms are called hybrid
evolutionary algorithms (EAs), memetic algorithms (MAs), Lamarckian evolu-
tionary algorithms, Baldwinian EAs, and local search or cultural genetic algorithms.
These algorithms are not used for convergence to high-quality results only, also for
further efﬁcient search mechanism [13, 14]. Selecting only the minimum relevant
features from the original subset is the main challenge in feature selection. This
work aims to develop ‘symmetrical uncertainty and genetic algorithm (SU-GA)’-
based feature selector named universal and novel feature selector. The goal of this
study is to make accurate prediction with the help of least number of signiﬁcant
features. In this research work, the features undergo memetic (genetic) evolution
such as ‘include’ and ‘remove’ to select the features. The examined results prove
the proposed SU-GA-based classiﬁer attains signiﬁcant dimensionality reduction in
various dimensional datasets from the UCI machine learning repository [15].

Proposed Method
3.1
Symmetrical Uncertainty
The symmetrical uncertainty (SU) between features and the target concept are used
to obtain the best features for classiﬁcation. Features with a larger SU value obtain
greater weight. SU measures the relationship among X, Y variables based on the
information theory. It can be calculated as follows.
SUðX; YÞ ¼ 2
IðX; YÞ
HðXÞ þ HðYÞ
Considering I(X, Y) as the MI among X, Y. H(..) as an entropy function for X,
Y features. The SU admits the normalized range value [0,1] as correction factor
value is 2. If SU value is 1, then the information of one feature is absolutely
predictable. If SU value is 0, then X, Y are not associated.
3.2
Genetic Algorithm
The amount for genetic algorithm (GA) [16] is stated randomly for all individual
chromosome that encrypt the feature subsets. Each chromosome are assembled with
binary string, and the binary string encrypting describes that the value ‘1’ (‘0’)

number of SF.
3.3
Proposed SU-GA Feature Selector
The proposed hybrid feature selection algorithm including feature ranking and
optimal feature selection (FR-OFS) method adopts the ﬁlter method with wrapper
method to attain the optimal subset features. First phase, the proposed algorithm
selects very few relevant features, by computing the SU values between features
and the target concept. Second phase, GA is used to search the optimal subset of
features with higher accuracy obtained in the ﬁrst phase with symmetrical uncer-
tainty. The number of GA is set based on features rank rendering from the
examined results from SU. Features having higher SU value will have the higher
possibility, where the feature can be selected, that states the resembling bits will
have more possibility to be select in the chromosome. Each individual’s ﬁtness is
evaluated using GA such as the value of the result by using the ﬁtness function. The
chromosomes might subjectively have transformed by the crossover and mutation
functions. This impacts the aptness value is carried out by both crossover and
mutation operation. The procedure is repeated until acceptable results are obtained.
The features are chosen at the end of this space called as reliable features. The
proposed SU-GA feature selector is shown in Figs. 1 and 2.

System Implementation and Experimental Results
The implementation of proposed SU-GA Feature selector is on twofold. Firstly, the
SU value of each feature is examined, and the features are prioritized based on the
highest SU value, and those features having lesser SU are eliminated by considering

as an irrelevant and redundant feature. Both WEKA and MATLAB tool box are
used to successfully implement the proposed hybrid feature selector SU-GA. In the
second phase, genetic algorithm is applied on the selected feature subset by SU to
ﬁnd out the optimal feature with out compromising the classiﬁcation accuracy. The
ﬁnal set of optimal features selected by the proposed hybrid feature selector SU-GA
is tested with the help of various benchmark classiﬁcation algorithms in the liter-
ature by using the classiﬁcation accuracy, number of reduced features, and time
taken to build a model by using 10-fold crossvalidation as a test method.
4.1
Experimental Setup
Totally, 10 benchmark dataset from UCI machine learning repository is chosen for
carrying out the experiments on the existing and proposed feature selector in terms
of number of feature selected by each method, the improvement in detection per-
formance of classiﬁers by each method and time taken to build a model by each
method are empirically evaluated and tested on various datasets including Soybean,
Lung Cancer, Ionosphere, and Dermatology. The summary of this datasets such as
the number of attributes and instances in each dataset is shown in Table 1.
Different classiﬁcation algorithm, namely NB, J48, SMO, and JRIP, are applied
on both original as well as number of features selected by SU, GA, and proposed
SU-GA feature selector. The proposed method is implemented using WEKA and
MATLAB tool box. The features having higher SU values are identiﬁed through
ranker search algorithm available in WEKA. The number best-ranked features by
SU was given as an input to the GA toolbox available in the MATLAB to select
only the optimal feature set through eliminating both irrelevant and redundant
features effectively. Finally, it varies supervised classiﬁers applied on both original
and optimal subset of features selected by the proposed method. The classiﬁcation
accuracy, number of selected feature by each method, and time taken for classiﬁers
are clearly proved that the proposed method is superior than other existing feature
selector in the literature. The results are presented in Tables 3 and 4.

Results and Discussions
In this experiment, three widely used evaluation measures features selected; clas-
siﬁcation accuracy and processing time are adopted to evaluate the proposed
method. This proposed SUGAFS algorithm and other two feature selection algo-
rithms SU and GA are implemented in WEKA and MATLAB. These three algo-
rithms are tested and compared on ten discrete UCI datasets. The results abstained
from SU, genetic feature selection methods, and the proposed method have been
tabulated. Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 exemplify the number of features selected,
classiﬁcation performance, and the time taken by the proposed method with SU and
GA methods. This experiment shows the proposed method is more effective when
compared with available feature selection methods.
4.3
Feature Selection
FS is a process of driving the subset features from the original feature space. The
proposed method has been applied in all datasets to select the relevant features by
removing the irrelevant one. Table 2 shows the features selected by using SU, GA,
and SU-GA. The results indicate that the proposed method selects the least number
of features than other two methods for all the ten datasets. Notably, this method
selects around ten percentage of attributes for segment challenge and vote datasets.
For lung cancer and vehicle data, it selects only around twenty percentage of
features. If the selected features are decreased, the performance of classiﬁcation
algorithm does improve this advocates the necessity of feature selection. Therefore,
effective feature selection may improve the accuracy and performance of learning
algorithms (Fig. 3).

Classiﬁcation Performance
In order to evaluate how well original features and each selected feature by different
feature selector including SU, GA and SU-GA will able to improve the detection
performance of various classiﬁers is empirical evaluated. The various classiﬁcation
algorithms are used in numerous sets in predicting the results, and the value are
observed. It is observed that the selected features by SU-GA feature selector will able
to improve the detection performance of all the classiﬁers. However, this method
selects more number offeatures as compared with the proposed method which selects
only 30% of features. It is worth to note that the difference of classiﬁcation perfor-
mance between GA and the proposed method is very small with better running time
and number of features selected. And also, the proposed method is effective and
efﬁcient when compared with other available feature selection methods.
Table 5 shows the average learning accuracy and observed the proposed SU-GA
feature selector improves the detection performance of JRIP and decision table
algorithms and is comparatively improved than the other methods. This experi-
mentation concludes that the attributes reduced through SUGAFS, and classiﬁca-
tion accuracy may increase or remain comparatively identical. The exploratory
results illustrate the classiﬁcation accuracy from the chose feature subset indicates
prevalent results than all other existing strategies (Fig. 4).
4.5
Processing Time
In the third phase, several tests are carried out to assess the running time of the
proposed method across all the datasets. It is also conducted that the same exper-
iments for SU and GA feature selection methods. After obtaining the results, the
performance of the three feature selection methods are compared with the original
dataset in terms of running time. The detailed results are provided in Tables 6, 7
and 8. From the experimental results, it can be noted that the proposed feature
selection method drastically reduces the running time of a learning algorithms.

Conclusion
In this work, both SU and GA are combined named as hybrid feature selector for
the purpose of eliminating both irrelevant and redundant features and to select only
the most relevant features for improving data classiﬁcation. The performance of the
proposed feature selector was evaluated in terms of three quality measures such as
number of selected features, detection performance of classiﬁers, and time taken to
build the model with the dataset from University of California Irvine dataset. The
proposed SU and GA should probably become part of the standard tool box of
feature selection method for effective data classiﬁcation. The proposed method can
more clearly be stated as follows:
1. SU and GA are combined named as SU-GA hybrid feature selector for selecting
only most relevant features for supervised. The system is aimed at making
improvements over the existing work in three perspectives such as reduction in
feature set, improvement in classiﬁcation accuracy, and ﬁnally, minimizing the
running time of achieving the goal.
2. The proposed method signiﬁcantly reduces processing time than any other
feature selection methods with minimal number of features. The result of
SU-GA imparts higher classiﬁcation accuracy rate for some dataset with mini-
mum selected features and minimum running time.
3. The proposed features and learning paradigm SU-GA are promising strategies to
be applied on any data classiﬁcation problems.

Sensorless Direct Torque Control
of Induction Motor Using Neural
Network-Based Duty Ratio Controller
H. Sudheer, S.F. Kodad and B. Sarvesh
Abstract Improvements in the sensorless direct torque control of an induction
motor by employing fuzzy logic switching controller (FLSC) plus neural
network-based duty ratio controller (NNDRC) are explained in this paper. The
conventional direct torque control (CDTC) of an induction motor suffers from
major drawbacks such as high ripples in motor torque and ﬂux response, poor
performance during low speed and starting, and switching frequency variations due
to hysteresis bands. Duty ratio controller evaluates the time for which active
switching state is applied (d), and for the remaining time period, zero switching
vector is applied. The simulation results show that by using FLSC with NNDRC,
considerable reduction in torque and ﬂux ripples and improvement in dynamic
response of drive compared to CDTC are achieved.

circuit [2, 3]. However, conventional direct torque control (CDTC) suffers from major
disadvantages such as (a) high ﬂux and torque ripples predominantly during starting
and at low-speed operation [4–6], (b) variable switching frequency due to hysteresis
bands and variable motor speed [4–6], and (c) current and torque distortion when
sector changes [6]. In order to overcome the disadvantages, several techniques are
developed by researchers such as direct self-control, DTC with SVM, and DTC-SVM
with neuro-fuzzy logic controllers as given in [7]. In recent years, researchers
employed the use of artiﬁcial intelligent (AI) techniques such as fuzzy logic, neural
networks, and neuro-fuzzy for direct torque control. The execution of the CDTC
switching table with fuzzy logic is given in [8, 9] which results in the reduction of
torque and ﬂux ripples to some extent. The torque ripple reduction using a simple duty
ratio controller is ﬁrst proposed in [10]. The duty ratio algorithm proposed by [11]
demonstrates that active voltage vector is applied for only the part of a sampling
period, while the zero voltage vector is applied for the remaining time period results in
the torque ripple reduction. In this paper, CDTC ﬁrst improved using fuzzy
logic-based switching controller called fuzzy DTC (FDTC). As explained in the [12],
speed sensor elimination was important in the industry. The sensorless control results
in lower cost and reduced hardware complexity. The CDTC is ﬁrst improved by a
fuzzy logic switching controller (FLSC) which used 180 fuzzy rule base. In this paper,
optimal duty ratio using ANN is implemented. The performance of FDTC with neural
network-based duty ratio (NNDRC) controller is assessed using MATLAB/Simulink
simulation results. Simulation results indicate that there are considerable improve-
ments in both dynamic and steady-state responses of an induction motor using FDTC
with NNDRC when compared to CDTC.

Conventional Direct Torque Control (CDTC)
In CDTC, the torque and ﬂux are controlled by the selection of the optimal
switching vector of inverter based on torque, ﬂux errors, and stator ﬂux angle [1, 3].
The selection of inverter switching vector is done using a classical switching table,
such that ﬂux and torque are bound within the hysteresis limits, thereby enabling
the fast transient response of the drive. The challenges in DTC are the estimation of
the torque and ﬂux parameters and development of an optimal switching table. The
induction motor is fed by voltage source inverter (VSI). Motor stator currents (ia, ib)
and rotor ﬂux angle are feedback to current-based model reference adaptive system
estimator [12], which estimates torque and speed of the induction motor. The speed
error is given to the discrete PI controller of KP = 2, KI = 300. The PI controller
output is limited using saturator T
e = ±8 Nm. The estimated torque (Te) compared
with its reference value (T
e ) generates a torque error (eT) which is processed
through three-level hysteresis comparator so as to limit the torque error. The ref-
erence ﬂux of the motor is estimated based on motor parameters given by:

The estimated ﬂux compared with reference ﬂux generates ﬂux error (eu) which
is processed through two-level hysteresis comparator. Depending on the stator ﬂux
angle, the stator ﬂux plane is divided into six sectors. If the stator ﬂux angle lies
between −30° and +30° is sector 1, +30° to +90° is sector 2 and so on. The
hysteresis comparator outputs ‘eT’, ‘eu’ and sector (S(n)) are given to a switching
table, which selects the optimal switching state Sa, Sb, Sc of voltage source inverter.
The optimal switching vector is selected based on present sector, ﬂux error, and
torque error [13].
3
DTC Using Fuzzy Logic Switching Controller (FDTC)
The major reasons for high torque and ﬂux ripples are ﬁxed magnitude hysteresis
bands and application of switching vector for the complete sample time period.
Fuzzy logic supports the variable membership function which aids in selecting
optimal switching vector. Using fuzzy logic torque error (eT), ﬂux error (eu) and
stator ﬂux space (h) are divided into multiple subsections which enable the precise
and optimal selection of the switching vector The torque hysteresis band, ﬂux
hysteresis band, and switching table are replaced by FLSC as depicted in Fig. 1.
Fuzzy logic is an excellent tool to implement switching table. The optimal
voltage vector is selected using the rule base developed by an expert having
knowledge about process or plant. The expert’s intelligence is included using a set
Fig. 1 Block diagram of DTFC with NFDRC

of fuzzy rules. Fuzzy logic variable are assigned to membership values which lies in
between 0 and 1. FLSC has 3 input’s ﬂux error (u
s −us), torque error (T
e −Te),
stator ﬂux angle (hs), and one output switching state (n) [4, 14]. 3 inputs cannot be
applied to FLSC directly; they are fuzziﬁed before applying to the fuzzy rule base.
In fuzziﬁcation process, the inputs are fuzziﬁed using fuzzy membership functions.
The mapping of inputs and output depends on a rule base. The fuzzy rule is
developed based on expert knowledge and intuition in order to meet the objective of
controlling. Since there are three MFs for eu, ﬁve MFs for eT, and twelve MF s for h
signals, 3  5  12 = 180 fuzzy rules are developed to select one of seven MFs
for the output [9, 15]. The rule base proposed in [4] is employed. For example,
Rule: If eT is PL, eu is P, and h is h1, then the output is V1. The fuzziﬁed output is
developed using ‘Min-Max’ fuzzy inference method [4]. The aggregation gives a
range of output in fuzziﬁed form, which is converted into crisp value using
defuzziﬁcation. Out of available methods of defuzziﬁcation, the mean of maximum
(MoM) method is employed. The output of FLSC determines the switching vector
Vn (n = 0–6) that needs to be applied to VSI so the output is converted in SA, SB,
and SC switching signals using the Boolean expression.
4
Duty Ratio Controller Using Neural Network (NNDRC)
In most of the literature, duty ratio controller is applied to CDTC for torque ripple
reduction. The basic idea of duty ratio control is the selected active switching state
of VSI that is applied for just enough time that the motor torque and ﬂux reach their
reference values. Once Te reaches Tref, a zero switching state is applied for the
remaining switching time period (1 −d). The NNDRC determines a time duration
for which active voltage is applied. The selection of an optimal duty ratio is a
nonlinear function of torque error, reference ﬂux, and ﬂux angle in the particular
sector [13]. A nonlinear function which gives optimal duty ratio for every switching
cycle is difﬁcult to implement using conventional methods.
The NNRDC is implemented using feed-forward neural network with one hid-
den layer that is trained for the evaluation of an optimal duty ratio. The neural
network is developed using neural network toolbox in ‘MATLAB.’ The NNDRC
has three inputs: torque error, reference ﬂux, and stator ﬂux angle and one output
duty ratio. 80,000 samples of inputs and output are collected to develop the neural
net. Using ‘nftool’ command, the neural network ﬁtting tool is generated. Inputs
and targets are imported from a ﬁle stored in Mat ﬁle.
The feed-forward, backpropagation neural network with a hidden layer of 20
neurons with ‘Tansig’ (sigmoid transfer function) is selected, and an output layer of
one neuron with ‘Purelin’ (linear transfer function) is selected as shown in Fig. 2.
The neural networks are trained using Levenburg–Marquardt algorithm by setting
validation and testing as 15%. ANN learns by adaptation of weights in order to
reach the target of mean square error equal to zero. The best validation at 1000

epoch is shown in Fig. 3. Once the training is ﬁnished, the neural network Simulink
block is generated using ‘gensim’ as shown in Fig. 4 which is placed in the
Simulink model of FDTC with NNDRC. The trained neural network will select the
optimal duty, and the selected optimal duty ratio (d) is applied to switching vector
of VSI.

Simulation Results and Discussions
To evaluate the performance of FDTC with NNDRC in the improvement of the
dynamic and steady-state responses of drive, respective ‘Simulink’ models are
simulated using MATLAB software. To measure dynamic and the steady-state

performances of the drive, induction motor is initially subjected to a reference speed
of 50 rad/s and subjected to a sudden change from 50 to 100 rad/s at t = 0.4 s. In
order to test the effectiveness of a feedback loop and robustness of the drive
initially, the motor load torque is 0 Nm and subjected to a sudden load of 4 Nm at
t = 0.2 s. All simulations are performed for a sampling time of 1/10,000 s, i.e.,
equivalent to the sampling frequency of 10 kHz.
Figure 5 shows the speed response, torque response, ﬂux response, and stator
current’s response of CDTC of the induction motor. During starting, the motor is
able to reach a reference speed of 50 rad/s in t = 0.05 s, but the speed response
contains peak overshoot of 9% and few oscillations. At t = 0.5 s, it is subject to
step change with xref = 100 rad/s. The drive is able to track the speed of 100 rad/s
with load torque of 4 Nm, but the speed response contains an overshoot of 2.5%
and oscillations as shown in Fig. 5.
The motor torque contains ripples and peak overshoot of 6 Nm when subjected
to a step change of 4 Nm. During steady state, torque response contains ripples of
4 ± 1.2 Nm. The ﬂux response contains the ripples 0.924 ± 0.076 Wb. As shown

in the ﬁgure, the stator currents are not purely sinusoidal and contain ripples during

Figure 6 shows the speed response, torque response, ﬂux response, and stator
current’s response of FDTC with NNDRC (neural network-based duty ratio con-

speed of 50 rad/s in t = 0.07 s, but the speed response had a zero peak overshoot
and reaches a steady state of 50 rad/s without any oscillations. At t = 0.5 s, it is
subject to step change with xref = 100 rad/s. The drive is able to track the speed of
100 rad/s with a load torque of 4 Nm. The speed response does not contain peak
overshoot and oscillations as shown in Fig. 6. The motor torque overshoot is
reduced to 4.4 Nm when subjected to a step change of 4 Nm. During steady state,

Summary/Conclusion
This paper proposes the use of fuzzy logic switching controller along with neural
network-based duty ratio controllers for improvements in sensorless direct torque
control of induction motor. The fuzzy logic switching controller selects an optimal
switching state to meet the torque demand and reference speed of induction motor.
In FDTC with NNDRC, active switching state is applied for a time determined by
optimal duty ratio (d) developed by duty ratio controller for each sampling period,
and for the remaining time (1 −d), a zero switching state is applied. Simulation
results show that using FDTC with NNDRC, the torque and ﬂux ripples are reduced
to 99 and 86.84%. Dynamic and steady-state response of the induction motor is
improved using proposed schemes.

Multichannel Charger for Lithium-Ion
Batteries
Vipin Valsan and Agidi Oghenemaro Emmanuel
Abstract Recently, the usage of portable electronic gadgets such as laptops and
mobile devices has grown massively. These developments have led to an alarming
increase in demand for rechargeable batteries. Beneﬁts of lithium-ion batteries
include but are not limited to high operating voltage, high energy density and low
maintenance because it has no memory making it the most widely used recharge-
able battery in today’s electronic industry [1]. With Li-ion batteries being in such
high demand, numerous researches have been conducted to develop a suitable
charging system for them. In recent times, majority of these researches have been
focused on charging the lithium-ion battery for automobile application. In this
paper, a single-output charger for charging lithium-ion batteries of different spec-
iﬁcation is presented and simulated. A TTC dynamic model of Li-ion battery is
modeled in MATLAB/Simulink. A DC–DC buck converter is designed and a PI
controller is integrated into the system for stabilizing the output. The novelty of the
proposed system is that it can be used to charge multiple devices sequentially. From
the experimental results obtained, the proposed charging system has the ability of
charging Li-ion batteries of laptops and mobile phones with a current ripple of less
than 1%.

Introduction
In recent years, the number of portable electronic gadgets such as tablets, mobile
phones, and laptops has increased tremendously. This development has resulted in
an increase in demand for portable batteries. Rechargeable batteries are often
preferred in these devices because in the long run they represent a more
cost-effective solution. Today, secondary batteries such as NiCd and NiMH are
inadequate in satisfying consumer’s requirements as a result of their generally
bulky size and low energy capacity [2]. In contrast, advantages such as low
maintenance, no memory effect, portability, and high energy density have made
lithium-ion battery the prominent battery for portable electronic systems.
With the demand of rechargeable batteries constantly on the rise in the consumer
market comes the complimentary increase in the demand for chargers to keep these
batteries in constant operation. The performance and life span of Li-ion batteries
largely depends on the quality of their chargers. Conventionally, the charging of
lithium-ion batteries occurs in two stages: Firstly, constant current (CC) is applied
to charge the battery until the battery voltage reaches the predetermined upper
voltage limit. This constant current stage is followed by a constant voltage charging
stage until the battery current attains a predeﬁned value. This approach is referred to
as the constant current–constant voltage (CC-CV) charging method, and it is often
employed in commercial battery charging ICs [1], but this method is mostly applied
to charge batteries of speciﬁc ratings. Similarly, various lithium-ion battery chargers
have been developed for charging multiple cell [2], but again the drawback of this
design as with majority of available multi output designs is that it can only be used
for a speciﬁc voltage rating.
In this paper, a single-output charger for charging lithium-ion batteries of dif-
ferent speciﬁcation is presented and simulated. The proposed charger system
comprised of a bridge rectiﬁer, capacitor ﬁlter, a DC–DC buck converter, a PI
controller, and a switching circuit at the output.
Also, in this paper a dynamic model of lithium-ion battery is established using
TTC equivalent circuit model in MATLAB/Simulink. The parameters of the
dynamic model are obtained from experimental results. These parameters are varied
with current and state of charge (SOC), thus allowing various circuit designs to be
made using the parameters of the battery. These battery models are capable of
predicting current–voltage (I–V) performance and predicting the runtime of the
battery [3].
This paper is arranged as follows: Sect. 2 explains the charger system; Sect. 3
describes the Li-ion battery; Sect. 4 provides some experimental test results of the
charger and the Li-ion battery; Sect. 5 presents results of the charger combined with
the battery; Sect. 6 describes Discussion and Conclusion.

Charger System
2.1
Architecture/Hardware Conﬁguration/Charger
Overview
The general overview of the charger is shown in Fig. 1. The rectiﬁer (bridge) is
used to convert alternating voltage signal from the supply source to pulsating DC
voltage, and the ﬁlter circuit (capacitor) is used to smoothen the DC output. The
output of the ﬁlter is fed to the input of the buck converter which depends on the
switching circuit provides output voltage and current for charging the batteries.
A PWM signal is used to switch the buck converter (MOSFET) for a speciﬁed
duty
cycle.
The
output

is

(PI) controller. The entire charger system design can be divided into three major
sections: buck converter, controller, and the switching circuit. The rectiﬁer section
is a bridge rectiﬁer and capacitor, and its operation is as basic as any rectiﬁcation
process in power electronics.
2.2
Buck Converter
Of all available DC–DC converters available, the buck converter is the simplest
form that can reduce DC voltage without the application of a transformer. The
conventional buck converter is shown in Fig. 2 [4].
For this paper, the ideal switch shown in the conventional buck converter is
replaced by a MOSFET. The buck converter operates by switching the MOSFET
between ON and OFF states at high frequency. A pulse width modulation
(PWM) signal controls the duty cycle of the MOSFET to regulate buck converter’s
output. At the beginning of each switching cycle, the gate signals turn the MOSFET

on and reverse bias the diode; therefore, the potential difference between input and
output of the converter is applied across the inductor which results in a linear
increase in inductor current. When the MOSFET turns off, the voltage across the
inductor becomes negative and the inductor current decreases linearly. The energy
stored in the inductor is transferred to the load. The relationship between the output
voltage and the input voltage is given as
Vout ¼ Vin  D
ð1Þ
where duty cycle D is ton
T .
ton is the period for which the MOSFET is on, and T is the total period of the
MOSFET.
2.2.1

Given the current ripple requirement, the value of the required inductor can be
obtained using Eq. (2).

Fs  DiL
ð2Þ
Vo is the output voltage; Fs is the frequency of one switching cycle; DiL is the
peak-to-peak inductor current ripple given by the design speciﬁcations; and D is the
duty cycle of the switch. Because both duty cycle and the output voltage are
changing during charge operation, the output capacitor is used to ﬁlter out the
inductor ripple current. If the capacitance is large enough, most of the ripple current
will ﬂow through the output capacitor. The value of the capacitor is given by (3).

Battery Modeling
To show the properties of the battery, an equivalent dynamic circuit model shown
in Fig. 5 is proposed [3].
The model above comprises of a DC voltage source, two RC parallel networks,
and a resistor in series. the DC source denoted as OCV is the open circuit voltage,
the internal resistance of the DC source is represented by series resistance Rs, and
the terminal voltage of the cell is represented by Vt while the two RC parallel
networks (R1, C1; R2, C2) are used to depict the voltage transient response of the
battery. The usable capacity of the battery is varied with different value of current in
consideration of the rate capacity effect. The battery’s state of charge (SOC) is
determined from the value of the usable capacity of the battery. All parameters
obtained from this model are dependent on the current and SOC of the battery [3].
Figure 6 shows the simulation model of the Li-ion battery in MATLAB/
Simulink. The output of the model is the battery’s terminal voltage which is a
controlled voltage source. The ﬁve subsystems seen in the proposed model are
employed to regulate the battery’s terminal voltage: They include SOC calculation,
OCV calc, RC values, voltages of RC parallel networks, and VRS. SOCo is the
initial state of charge while SOC is the real-time state of charge.

charge test (PDT) was carried out to obtain the parameters of the lookup tables

Design of Spectrum Sensing System
Riya Paul, Pamoli Nath and Soumyasree Bera
Abstract Current spectrum management is licensed in a deﬁnite frequency band,
and since a large part of radio spectrum allocation is already done, vacant bands are
not available to either effectively use new services or develop existing ones. As a
solution to this, it is required to ﬁnd means for improved spectrum utilization
creating situations for access of dynamic spectrum. In these days, spectrum scarcity
is a prime hurdle faced by all users. This problem gives rise to the idea of cognitive
radio, where available channels for communication are detected and instantly
moved into vacant channels. In this paper, matched ﬁltering and energy detection
methods are covered, where our motive is the all-time presence of spectrum to all
users.

Introduction
The available electromagnetic radio spectrum is highly scarce. This issue is solved
by the use of cognitive radio (CR) technology [1]. Cognitive radios [2] are designed
to ensure a trustworthy communication for all network users. According to inter-
action with environment, cognitive radio can change its parameters in which it
operates. Spectrum sensing, spectrum management, spectrum sharing, and spectrum
mobility are its four major functional blocks. In spectrum sensing, the presence of

spectrum and licensed user is determined. Spectrum management predicts the time
of availability for use to the unlicensed users. Spectrum sharing distributes the
spectrum holes among the secondary users taking care of the spectrum cost.
Spectrum mobility maintains uninterrupted communication for a better spectrum [3].
Figure 1 shows the classiﬁcation of spectrum sensing methods [4]. Among
these, the non-cooperative system is studied in this paper. Three signal processing
techniques are used for spectrum sensing [4] in the literature: matched ﬁlter, energy
detection, and cyclostationary feature detection. Matched ﬁltering, though optimal,
needs full knowledge of primary signaling. But when nothing is assumed, an energy
detector is used. In this paper, we have covered matched ﬁltering technique and
energy detection techniques.
2
Methodology
2.1
Energy Detection
Energy detection is the signal detection technique which uses an energy detector to
state the absence or presence of signal in the band. It is an efﬁcient approach to
spectrum sensing since its computational technique is not that complex and can be
implemented in both time domain and frequency domain [5]. Noise power
knowledge in the band to be sensed is required by the energy detector to adjust the
threshold of detection. Though not the best, energy detection is simple to imple-
ment, so it is widely used. The signal is detected as the energy detector output is
compared with the threshold. It is suitable for wideband spectrum sensing. It works
according to the following block diagram:
Fig. 1 Classiﬁcation of spectrum sensing
538
Riya Paul et al.

2.2
Match Filtering Process
A matched ﬁlter is a network in which the output peak-signal-to-noise (power) ratio
of a radar receiver is maximized which again maximizes a target detectability. Here,
the signal detection is ﬁrst done using various codes, which are described later.
Matched ﬁlter is a trusty detection technique but requires the primary user signal
knowledge beforehand. The block diagram of matched ﬁlter is shown in Fig. 3.
3
Simulation Results
At ﬁrst, the desired transmitted signal is generated and the noise is added to give the
real time effect of channel during transmission. The same signal can also be treated
as channel ouput which then becomes the received signal. The presence or absence
of the transmitted signal is evaluated from this received signal. The received signal
is then passed through the different sensing techniques following the methods
shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. For each case, a particular threshold level is
set, and comparing the signal level with this level, it is concluded whether a
spectrum is sensed or not. Further, the experiment is continued to ﬁnd out the
detection probability of each of the sensing techniques for different signal-to-noise
ratios (SNR), so as to deﬁne up to which SNR, the system is able to detect the
presence or absence of any spectrum.
3.1
Energy Detection Method
Energy detection method [6] is the simplest form of detection techniques, and the
details of the method are already being discussed in the previous section (shown in
Fig. 2).
Fig. 2 Frequency-domain representation of energy detection
Fig. 3 Match ﬁltering using spectrum sensing
Design of Spectrum Sensing System
539

In this method, at ﬁrst, a simple sinusoidal signal is being generated and the
same is being considered as the transmitted signal. The generated signal is shown in
Fig. 4. Figure 5 shows the signal that is being fed to the sensing system at a
particular SNR.
The performance of the designed energy detection technique is tested and ver-
iﬁed in terms of two properties—(i) probability of detection (Pd) versus SNR and
(ii) probability of false alarm (Pfa) versus SNR. At ﬁrst, Pd versus SNR is plotted as
shown in Fig. 6, which depicts that the system is able to detect the presence of
spectrum when the SNR is positive. Therefore, the system will work in positive
SNR, but it fails when the SNR is negative.
The next performance that is being tested is the Pfa versus SNR (in Fig. 7)
which is just the reverse implication of probability of detection; i.e., at higher SNR,
the chances of false detection is negligible, whereas at lower SNR, Pfa is very high.
Fig. 4 Original transmitted signal
Fig. 5 Signal received by the sensing system
540
Riya Paul et al.

3.2
Match Filtering Method
The second sensing technique that has been designed is match ﬁltering [7] where
the receiver is able to detect only the known type of spectrum and rejects the rest.
Therefore, to create such waveform, coded signal is considered as the transmitted
signal. At ﬁrst, the various coded signals are designed and their correlation property
is tested (such as barker code, P1 code, P2 code, P3 code, P4 code), and the code
with best correlation property is selected as the transmitted signal, i.e., P4 code.
The autocorrelation of the generated transmitted signal (P4 coded) is shown in
Fig. 8. After the generation, it is being polluted by adding noise to it so as to
provide the channel effect (refer Fig. 9).
As discussed previously that the performance of the system is tested in terms of
its Pd versus SNR and Pfa versus SNR, same is being implemented in this case as
well.
Therefore, Figs. 10 and 11 depict the Pd versus SNR and Pfa versus SNR of the
match ﬁltering method.
But the constraint of this method is that it is able to detect only known type of
signal unlike the energy detection technique [8].

Conclusion
This paper presented a comparative study of all detection codes using matched
ﬁltering and energy detection techniques. As SNR goes beyond 5 dB, a good
probability of detection of signal is found (from Fig. 6). Though we have used
matched detection technique here, it is totally code-dependent, which makes
cyclostationary process a better one. In the future, spectrum sensing analysis can be
done using cyclostationary method also. Its hardware implementation can be done
which will make the process more efﬁcient.

Mathematical Model of SRM
Main objective of motor modeling is to derive a nonlinear function to relate the
mechanical output (torque, speed) of the motor to the electrical input (voltage,
current). In conventional motors, torque can be represented as a function of motor
current or its component. As against it, motor torque is nonlinear function of phase
current and angular position of rotor. The phase current is also a function of both
ﬂux-linkage and rotor angle.
Figure 1 represents simpliﬁed model of the SRM. It has only single source of
magnetic ﬁeld production, i.e., stator winding, and there is no winding on the rotor.
Magnetic material (rotor) placed in between this magnetic ﬁeld experience a force
of attraction. Voltage balance equation for the phase can be written as (1) as applied
phase voltage is equal to summation of the voltage drop across phase resistance and
rate of change of ﬂux-linkage. Flux-linkage Eq. (2) is derived using integration.
Electrical characteristics of the SRM obtained from the Eqs. (1) and (2) are shown

dh. The total instantaneous torque of the motor is given by the summation of
the all phases. Linear model of the SRM is sufﬁcient for the implementation of the
controller; however, the nonlinear model is required for the realization of complete
SRM drive and to investigate the dynamic behavior of the entire system.
Many practices have been in use to model the magnetic nonlinearity of the SRM;
out of which, several methods are covered in the following sections.
1.1
Method-1: Look-Up Table-Based Approach
The look-up table-based approach [1–3] is very accurate method to represent the
magnetic nonlinearity of the SRM. The model of SRM discussed here is designed in
[1] for the electric vehicle propulsion, where the goal is optimal efﬁcient operation
of the drive. Magnetic characteristics of the SRM is shown in Fig. 4, which rep-
resents number of magnetic curves at the different rotor angle [1]. Look-up table is
used to store the magnetic characteristics as a three-dimensional data. The
ﬂux-linkage calculated from the Eq. (2) and the rotor angle are used as an index to
select the phase current. One more Look-up table is used to represent torque
characteristics of the motor. The torque characteristic of the SRM is shown in the
Fig. 5, which represents nonlinear relation among torque, phase current, and rotor

angle. The look-up table-based approach to map nonlinear characteristics of the
SRM reduces involvement of the dynamics equations and thus reduces the process
time. This method is the most accurate method to model a physical SRM, if precise
data of the magnetic as well as torque characteristics are available.
However, it requires a large amount of experimental workout to obtain the motor
characteristics. The accuracy of the model depends on the experimental technique
used to obtain the precise motor parameter as well as on the accuracy of the
measuring instruments. This method is time consuming and costly but is an
accurate modeling technique of the SRM. The experimental procedure required to
obtain the motor magnetic characteristics is well explained in [3].
This method is suitable to model an existing SRM, where it is required to study
the entire motor performance with high grade of accuracy along with the different
types of converter and control techniques. PC-based design and FEA software
packages such as PC-SRD and PC-FEA are available, which makes it possible to
derive the magnetic parameters of the motor from the dimensional detail and
winding parameters of the motor. It saves the time to model a SRM based on look-up
table; however, it requires a skill to deal with an available software package.
1.2
Method 2: Analytical Modeling Technique
It is possible to develop a mathematical expression to represent the magnetic
nonlinearity of the motor with the help of exponential or trigonometric functions.
Many modeling techniques have been published in the literatures to map the
magnetic nonlinearity in the form of mathematical equation, where the goal is to

determine number of unknown parameters from the motor parameters with calcu-
lations and analytical reasoning [4–7]. The piecewise analysis is covered in [7] to
connect the fundamental geometry and turns per phase of the motor with an ana-
lytical terminal description.

Equation (4) summarizes the magnetic characteristics of the SRM over all the
rotor position and current, where a1(h), a2(h), and a3(h) are the unknown coefﬁcient
needs to be determined. The derivative of ﬂux represents an incremental inductance

Unsaturated phase inductance ‘L’ can be represented as a function of rotor angle
as given below:

ð6Þ
Equation (6) is simpliﬁed as,
a2ðhÞ ¼ a3ðhÞ  LðhÞ

ð7Þ
It is required to determine three unknown coefﬁcients a1(h), a3(h), and L(h),
which depend on rotor angle. The piecewise linear models assumed for the coef-
ﬁcients are shown in Fig. 6. The angle ha and hu refer to aligned and unaligned
position of the rotor, respectively. The stator/rotor pole arc is fully covered by the
rotor/stator pole arc, from the rotor angle ha to the angle h1, and just after h1 pole
arcs start uncovering. The angle h2 represents a position, where both the pole arcs
just become fully uncovered. The process of the determination involves deter-
mining all eleven parameters listed in Table 1. Seven parameters are found based
on simple calculation, two are based on values from tables and two are found
iteratively. Angular breakpoints are found directly from the motor design param-
eter. Inductive constant Lmax is found from the equation, while determination of
Lcorner and Lmin require dimensional detail of the rotor and stator pole, to ﬁnd out
the constant from the table [7]. The magnetization coefﬁcient a1(ha) and a3(ha) are
found iteratively. The values for a1(hu) and a3(hu) are then taken as constant
fraction of a1(ha) and Lmin, respectively. Step-by-step procedure of ﬁnding each
parameter is covered in [7].
If all the eleven parameters are known, then coefﬁcients a3(h), L(h), and a1(h)
can be found from the simple equations. The MATLAB embedded function is
designed to represent a nonlinear relation among ﬂux-linkage, phase current, and
rotor angle approaching analytical modeling technique. Flowchart of the embedded

function design is shown in Fig. 7 where it is assumed that all the eleven parameters
are known. The embedded function provides the value of the ﬂux-linkage for the
given phase current and rotor angle. The design parameters of the motor are listed
in the Table 2. The magnetization coefﬁcient, inductance constant, and angular
breakpoints are derived from the design parameter of the SRM, as summarized in
Table 2 design parameter of 60 kW SRM (Table 3).
The magnetic characteristics derived using embedded function is compared with
the actual magnetic characteristics of method-1 in Fig. 8. The accuracy of the
nonlinear function mapping is quite reasonable for the low phase current value. The
phenomena of pole corner saturation and saturation of yoke reduce the accuracy of
the mapping, at the higher current level. The details about motor geometry and
winding turns are sufﬁcient for the analytical modeling technique; however, several
pre-calculations are required. This method reduces the time and cost of the mod-
eling technique compared to method-1, where it was required to collect a large

method is suitable for the performance evaluation of the power electronics con-
verter and different control techniques as well as to predict the performance of the
motor.

The electromagnetic torque is a nonlinear function of the phase current and rotor

The

modeling
technique
considers
nonlinear
relation
of
inductance-current-angle relation to represent a magnetic nonlinearity of the SRM,
instead of ﬂux-current-angle relation [8, 9]. The phase-winding inductance is a
nonlinear function of rotor angle and phase current. The variation of the phase
inductance with the rotor position is expressed by a limited number of Fourier series
terms. The coefﬁcients of the Fourier series are determined by the values of the
inductance at the aligned position, unaligned position, and midway position. The
nonlinear relation between the phase inductance and the current is represented by
the polynomial functions. The coefﬁcients of the polynomial are derived by static
characteristics obtained from experimental results or ﬁnite element analysis. The
dynamic phase equation can be represented as a function of phase inductance as

where ‘xm’ is the motor speed in rad/sec, ‘i’ is the phase current, and ‘L(h, i)’ is the
equivalent inductance of the phase. The leakage inductance and the mutual

further as

where e(h, i) is the back EMF ¼ dLðh; iÞ

The equivalent inductance of the phase is represented as a three terms of the
Fourier series as
Lðh; iÞ ¼ L0ðiÞ þ L1ðiÞ cosðhÞ þ L2ðiÞ cosð2hÞ

and thus, the back EMF can be represented by the derivative as—

where ‘La’ is the aligned position inductance, ‘Lm’ is the midway position induc-
tance and ‘Lu’ is the unaligned position inductance. The aligned position inductance
and midway position inductance are function of the phase current, while the
inductance at the unaligned position can be assumed as the independent of the
phase current. The inductances La, Lm, and Lu are represented as—

Comparison of the Modeling Techniques
Both the method-2 and method-3 provide analytical solution to account for the
magnetic nonlinearity of the SRM. Method-3 requires experimental data of
inductance proﬁle L(h, i) of the SRM to obtain coefﬁcient of Fourier series. It
provides reasonable accuracy compared to the method-2; however, it requires
experimental setup which increases the cost and time of implementation. Also the
computation time of the simulation model is comparatively high as it involves
derivative calculations. This method is suitable to analyze the performance of the
converter as well as to obtain the dynamic performance of the SRM drive. The
method-2 does not require experimental data; however, it involves extensive cal-
culations to derive polynomial coefﬁcients. Even though the coefﬁcients are com-
puted with good precision, accuracy of method-2 is somewhat less due to error in
ﬂux derivative calculation. The details about motor geometry and winding turn
parameters are required initially. This method takes minimum time and cost to
derive the simulation model as compared to other methods. It gives high accuracy
for low current level, while effect of magnetic saturation reduces the accuracy of the
model at the higher current level. The method can be used to investigate the
performance of various converter topologies and control techniques, which helps in
its performance and design optimization. The method-1 accounts for the nonlin-
earity of the SRM magnetic characteristics while it minimizes the simulation time.
This is because it avoids all partial derivatives and utilizes a look-up table which
approximates the relation ﬂux-current position and torque-current position.
However, it requires large number of experimental data, and thus, it takes maximum
time to derive simulation model of the SRM. Nevertheless, the method provides
highest efﬁciency among all other methods, and it also has advantage of minimum
computation time which results in faster simulation.
Several techniques have been published in past which use artiﬁcial intelligent
techniques to model nonlinearity of SRM [10]. All this techniques tries to achieve
highest accuracy to replace look-up table-based approach. But it is computational
intensive and required prior knowledge of magnetic characteristics.
3
MATLAB Simulink Model of the SRM
The nonlinear model of the SRM is derived using method-1. The look-up tables are
used to represent the magnetic characteristics (Fig. 4) as well as the torque char-
acteristics (Fig. 5) of the 60 kW SRM. The Simulink model of the SRM is shown is
Fig. 10 where look-up tables ‘ITBL’ and ‘TTBL’ store the ﬂux-angle-current and
current-angle-torque relation, respectively. The motor model produces the torque
and speed for the voltage applied to the phase. The model of the converter is
developed using ‘simpowersystem’ library components. It is also possible to model
Modeling and Simulation of Switched Reluctance Motor

various converters and control techniques using the Simulink library. However,
‘simpowersystem’ library of the MALTAB offers ﬂexibility and easy to model a
power electronic and power system components using the node-based circuit
simulation approach. The main advantage of using a ‘simpowersystem’ library to
develop the model of converter is that actual devices used in the drive system can
be modeled quickly because of readily available modules of the power electronics
switches. It offers a great ﬂexibility to study the different converter topologies and
certain practical issues can be clearly understood.
Two methods are developed to incorporate the model of converter, designed
with ‘simpowersystem’ library, and the model of the motor, designed with
‘Simulink’ library. The ﬁrst method uses the resistive element and the dependent
current source from the ‘simpowersystem’ library to represent a phase of the motor
as shown in Fig. 11a [1, 11]. The switching device in series with the motor phase is
not shown for the simplicity. The node voltage across the motor phase is converted
into the single line signal using the voltage measurement block of the ‘simpow-
ersystem’ library, and it is applied to the Simulink model of the motor. The motor
model produces current, torque, and speed according to the applied phase voltage.
The phase current in the ‘simpowersystem’-based phase model depends upon the
phase current of the ‘Simulink’ model. Thus, phase voltage applied to the phase of
the ‘simpowersystem’ model results in the production of torque and speed in the
Fig. 10 Simulink model of the SRM

‘Simulink’ model; while at the same time, the phase current of the ‘Simulink’
model reﬂects to the phase of ‘simpowersystem’ model.
The controlled voltage source-based method is applicable where the ﬂux-linkage
is to be estimated from the phase current and rotor angle, as in method-2. The
resistive element and dependent voltage source from the ‘simpowersystem’ library
form a motor phase. The phase current is transformed to the single line signal using
ampere meter. The voltage source depends on the rate of change of ﬂux-linkage
generated from the embedded function, and thus, phase current is governed by the
Eq. (11).

Conclusion
Present paper provides guidelines in selecting mathematical modeling technique for
particular application. Developed embedded model provides great ﬂexibility and
fast simulation compared to look-up table-based approach. This method is suitable
for performance analysis of SRM-based drive and converter, whereas look-up
table-based approach is must when accuracy is the main concern as like in state
observer-based sensorless motor control techniques. Furthermore, this paper pre-
sents that transpose of SRM model developed in MATLAB ‘Simulink’ library to
‘simpowersystem’ library is possible with the use of controlled voltage source and
controlled current course. It is important to model complete SRM drive where
converter of the motor needs to design in ‘simpowersystem’ library with available
models of semiconductor devices.

B. Senthil Kumar and K. Suresh Manic
Abstract This paper presents Continuous Sliding Mode controllers applied to
nonlinear high pressure rated modiﬁed CSTR system which has been linearized to
one operating point. Firstly, the ﬁrst-order sliding mode control or classical sliding
mode control has been discussed, and second-order super twisting control is used to
attain robustness properties in the presence of uncertain bounded External distur-
bances when applied to the system. Later, Terminal Sliding Mode Control and Fast
Terminal Sliding Mode Control are presented which result in faster convergence of
state variables with respect to initial values of the system. The convergence of state
variables to the equilibrium point occurs in ﬁnite time. The simulation results show
the improved control performances and the properties of continuous Sliding Mode
Controllers when applied for maintaining pH control for High Pressure Rated
Modiﬁed CSTR system where it has unmodelled dynamics as the external bounded
disturbance.

Introduction
pH is the degree of acidity or alkalinity of a solution. It is measured as log H þ
½
,
and the range of pH value is between 0 and 14. The logarithmic relationship
between hydrogen ion concentration and pH value, pH process is highly nonlinear
[1]. The nonlinearity present in the system has been linearized to one equilibrium
point, and transfer function has been attained. Control of pH is a difﬁcult task due to

the nonlinearity and higher sensitivity to disturbances of the process. The deep sea
condition is mimicked using high pressure rated environmental CSTR system to
study the growth of micro-organisms. For that, pH inside set-up has to be main-
tained at a predetermined level at elevated pressure. Due to various conditions like
elevated pressure, enzymes produced by microbes inside the environmental CSTR,
the pH value is going to vary frequently. For the survival of microbes, this variation
should be controlled. Around the neutral point (pH value 7), the pH curve has a
huge gain, i.e. even a small change in acid/base ﬂow is going to vary the pH value
drastically. The control of pH around this region is really challenging.
The system has to be modelled accurately for the design of controller. In this
work, it is modelled as a ﬁrst-order plus dead (FOPDT) system from the real-time
open-loop response [2, 3]. The system is having signiﬁcant delay due to various
reasons like the delay for uniform mixing of acid/base in the ﬁve litre environmental
CSTR [4]. This paper presents the robustness properties for the FOPDT system
using Sliding Mode Control, where the system is regulated under plant parametric
uncertainties and disturbances act along the input which is bounded.
Sliding Mode Controllers are used for the regulation of chemical process and
realizing robustness properties [5, 6]. Sliding Mode Control is a robust control
method used whenever there is a mismatch in the system where it comes from
unknown bounded external disturbance acting on the system [7, 8]. In this paper, the
state space methods are used and Linear State Feedback Control is studied along
with different type of Sliding Mode Controllers such as First Order SMC, Super
Twisting Control, Terminal Sliding Mode Control and Fast Terminal Sliding Mode
Control [9–11].

Control Strategy
2.1
First-Order SMC
The ﬁrst-order SMC is a reduced order controller which has a linear sliding surface
and becomes invariant when it reaches the sliding surface, and the control is dis-
continuous when applied to the system on the other hand super twisting controller is
a second-order controller where the control is a continuous type.
The delay time has been converted to a ﬁrst-order system.

Conclusion
The system which is a ﬁrst-order plus dead time has uncertainties when modelled
which has been controlled using ﬁrst-order sliding mode control where robust
properties has been realized. The realization shows Figs. 2 and 8 the phase plane
analysis for the First Order Sliding Mode Control Fig. 2, Terminal Sliding Mode
control Fig. 8 the convergence rate is ﬁnite near the equilibrium point and
Convergence rate is faster for Faster Terminal Sliding Mode Control when the
initial values are too far from the origin. The control variable which is discontin-
uous in the case of First-Order Sliding Mode control has lot of chattering which
occurs due to signum function‚ Whereas in the case of Terminal Sliding Mode
control and Fast Terminal Sliding Mode Control, the sliding surface is nonlipschitz,
that is nonlinear surface, but convergence rate is ﬁnite; with respect to magnitude of
the control input, there are some variations.

Experimental/Simulation Study to Check
the Signiﬁcance of Proximity Effect
Asha Shendge
Abstract Nowadays, due to smart grid technologies, the working on off seashore
wind/solar renewable energy where power carried through medium of submersible
cables, transient peaks have signiﬁcance to investigate proximity effect of a conductor
system. To investigate these phenomena, author has experimented energized pipe
conductor in close proximity to aluminum plate. The return path is provided by alu-
minum plate to check the signiﬁcance of proximity effect. The ﬁeld measurements are
carried out, and also, simulation is done with numerical method FDTD. Then, com-
parison is done between experimental measurements and simulations. As the height of
conductor varies from earth, distribution of current becomes uneven. It could be con-
cluded the proximity effect is represented by height variation from earth return path.

Introduction
The electromagnetic behavior of parameters of conductor/cable is represented by line
impedance Z and line admittance Y. The simulation models need Z and Y for con-
ductor system. While doing simulation using electromagnetic transient program
(EMTP) routine [1] it calculates conductor and cable transients using Z, the series
impedance using formulae derived by [2–5] that do not reﬂects the presence of
proximity effects. EMTP assumes cylindrically symmetric of currents and electro-
magnetic quantities and calculates skin effect. In case there is current deviating from
cylindrical distribution the assumption that only skin effect present due to Z in case
nature cylindrically symmetric of currents and quantities is no longer true. However,

more than one conductor or stranded cable is closer to each other, and also, frequency
f is increased proximity effect becomes more pronounced. To approach, the author has
already experimented [6] proximity effect for simple conductor system.
To investigate current distribution on conductor due to change in the height of
injection point, in order to investigate new formulae when conductor is used in
close proximity are the subject of interest. The FDTD helps to analyze the prox-
imity effect signiﬁcance for conditions where conductors are close to each other in
energized conductor.

Experimental Setup
Figure 1 shows the laboratory setup. For investigation, aluminum pipe with 2 m
length and 5 cm radius was used. 100 V was applied using source as pulse gen-
erator (PG). The source resistance was 1 kΩ. 100-Ω resistor through lead wire is
connected at receiving end. Then, it is terminated into aluminum plate as return
path. At center point of disk, the transient voltage was applied. For height
h = 5.5 cm, top, center, and bottom voltage is injected. It helps to observe effect of
close proximity for height change. The receiving end resistor positions as bottom,
center, and top of pipe are changed for nine conditions. The distribution of current
which ﬂows through the conductor to ground was measured.
Figure 2 illustrates detailed view of front and rear side of pipe. Points T, C, and
B represent top, center, and bottom positions of injection and receiving end resistor.

Whenever circuit theory approach could not solve transient problems, then electro-
magnetic theory comes into picture. Numerical analysis is carried out by Maxwell’s
equations. Digital computers can handle Maxwell’s equations expressed in differ-
ential forms that are valid integral forms is a discrete in nature. These forms of
Maxwell’s equations are the basic fundamentals of the ﬁnite-difference time-domain

problems [7] which can calculate various incidents and reﬂected and scattered ﬁelds.

FDTD Model
In this paper, Visual Simulation Test Laboratory developed by Central Research
Institute of Electrical Power Industry, Japan [8], is adopted. Pipe conductor cannot
be simulated directly by Visual Simulation Test Laboratory. The pipe is represented
by 4 conducting square plates. The pipe with width equal to equivalent of diameter
of aluminum pipe is constructed while doing simulation. The OC (open-circuit) and
SC (short-circuit) test conditions at receiving end as per experimental circuit were
simulated. The time period was 20 ns. Ds = 5 mm is the cell size of an analytical
space for VSTL simulation. An aluminum plate is assumed to be earthed with
resistivity qc = 2.8  10−8 Ωm. For simulation purpose there was around 40–50
cells boundary was set by apart. Injecting voltage was the measured waveform.
For injection of current and termination of receiving end by resistor, two square
plates were enclosed to front end as well as rear end as shown in Fig. 4.

Denoising of MRI Images Using Curvelet
Transform
Ranjit Biswas, Debraj Purkayastha and Sudipta Roy
Abstract Most of the medical images are usually affected by different types of
noises during acquisition, storage, and transmission. These images need to be free
from noise for better diagnosis, decision, and results. Thus, denoising technique
plays an important role in medical image analysis. This paper presents a method of
noise removal for brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image using curvelet
transform thresholding technique combined with the Wiener ﬁlter and compares the
result with the curvelet and wavelet-based denoising techniques. To assess the
quality of denoised image, the values of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), mean
square error (MSE), and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) are considered.
The experimental results show that curvelet denoising method depicts better result
than wavelet denoising method, but the combined method of curvelet with Wiener
ﬁltering technique is more effective than the wavelet- and curvelet-based denoising
method in terms of PSNR, MSE, and SSIM.

acquisition process, the images may be corrupted by different types of noise and it
is very important to remove the noise to get better interpretation. Removal of noise
from digital images is a big challenge for the researchers. Huang et al. [1] proposed
a type of median ﬁltering technique which is much faster and was implemented in
2D. Later, Ney [2] implemented a technique of dynamic programming for imple-
menting nonlinear smoothing ﬁlters, which gives a good result in removing noise
but keeps much more information around the curves by penalizing when there is
large difference in two consecutive samples and rewarding when these are close.
Saluja et al. [3] proposed an adaptive Wiener ﬁlter based on wavelet transform to
calculate coefﬁcients of weighted high-pass ﬁltering. Boulfelfel et al. [4] investi-
gated the usage of Wiener ﬁlter and PSE ﬁlter in CT images and developed a 3D
ﬁlter that performs better than 2D ﬁlters.
The transform domain ﬁltering contains wavelet transform, ridgelet transform,
and curvelet transform. Lang et al. [5] used wavelet analysis of undecimated
wavelet transform on unidimensional signals to remove noise which was one of the
earlier implementations of wavelet in noise removal. To remove noise and to
compress image, Chang et al. [6] used adaptive wavelet soft threshold using
data-driven method called as Bayes Shrink method for threshold estimation.
Mojsilovic et al. [7] classiﬁed the stages of liver disease using wavelet transform.
One of the important thresholding techniques—Visu Shrink developed by Donoho
et al. [8, 9] using wavelet shrinkage. Another technique called SURE (Stein’s
Unbiased Risk Estimator) shrink also developed by Donoho et al. [10], which is
based on SURE estimator developed by Steinin [11]. Stein name it as Unbiased
Risk Estimator. SURE estimator estimates mean of random normal variable which
is independent. Zhang [12] proposed and implemented diffusion in image domain
and also in wavelet domain.
Candes and Donoho [13] showed ridgelet transform of images. Based on rid-
gelets, curvelet transform came into existence. The disadvantage of wavelet
denoising is that it does not perform well while denoising in the curves in an image
and results in loss of details. Starck and Candes in [14] proposed a curvelet
transform based on Candes’s ridgelet technique. This technique can efﬁciently
represent a curve because it has ability to select and identify curves along with time
and frequency relations. This technique also uses wavelet shrinkage for thresh-
olding. Ulfarsson et al. [15] removed speckle noise efﬁciently from SAR images
using curvelet domain transform. Liu et al. [16] studied and analysed the curvelet
based on ridgelet. Ali et al. [17] developed a method to fuse CT image and MR
image, and the fusion is done in curvelet domain.

Denoising Techniques
There are two fundamental approaches to image denoising, viz. spatial domain
ﬁltering and transform domain ﬁltering methods.

R. Biswas et al.

2.1
Wavelet Transform
Wavelet is very useful for nonlinear representation of signals. Wavelet basically
decomposes the image into its time and frequency relation components. Thus, the
image is transformed into frequencies rather than pixel. In the wavelet domain, the
noisy image is decomposed into four subsamples according to their low (L) and
high (H) frequency bands called LL, LH, HL, and HH. The LL subsample is again
decomposed into four subsamples at level two [3] and so on as per the requirement
of the computation.
2.2
Curvelet Transform
Stark and Candes [14] solved the problem of wavelet transform by proposing
curvelet transform based on ridgelet transform. Ridgelet implementation was done
by converting it into radon transform. In the ridgelet transform, support interval or
the scaling is done by anisotropy scaling relationship, denoted by Eq. (1).
width = length2
ð1Þ
This was done in the ﬁrst generation of curvelet transform using multiscaling
ridgelet where the curve is divided into blocks and the subblocks are approximated
into a straight line and ridgelet analysis is done upon it. The basic curvelet
decomposition steps are given as follows.
The subband decomposition is done by Eq. (2).
f 7! ðP0f ; D1f ; D2f ; . . .Þ
ð2Þ
where P0 are subband ﬁlters, and Ds; s  0, and subbands Dsf contain details about
22s wide. The smooth windows are wQðx1; x2Þ which are localized in diadic
squares and which is deﬁned by Eq. (3).
Q ¼ k1=2s; ðk1 þ 1Þ=2s

  ½k2=2s; ðk2 þ 1Þ=2s

Then, the resulting square is renormalized to unit scale, which is represented by
Eq. (4).

Thresholding Technique
Thresholding in transform domain is achieved by hard thresholding and soft
thresholding to remove unwanted noise signals. Hard thresholding removes all the
value after a certain limit, and soft thresholding lowers the intensity of noise
towards zero values, which is deﬁned by Eqs. (6) and (7).

Proposed Technique
A new technique is proposed here using curvelet transform thresholding technique
combined with the Wiener ﬁlter. The curvelet transform helps to overcome the
problem of wavelet transform, and noise is removed using it ﬁrst, and then, the
Wiener ﬁlter is used to remove the residual noise.

Experimentation
In this work, the proposed technique along with other existing techniques is
experimented on MRI images of brain. The experiments are performed using
MATLAB on MRI images of size 256  256 following the wrapping technique on
curvelet software package. White Gaussian noise is added in MRI images with
different sigma, i.e., r = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70. Then, the various types of
denoising techniques were implemented, viz. Wiener ﬁlter, wavelet thresholding,
curvelet thresholding, and curvelet thresholding, with Wiener ﬁlter.

Results and Discussion
After applying different denoising methods to noisy MRI brain image, results were
compared visually and using quality metrics values of PSNR, MSE, and SSIM. The
experimental results show that the proposed combined method of curvelet with
Wiener ﬁlter-based image denoising is performed more effectively compared to
other methods. Tables 1, 2 and 3 show the PSNR, MSE, and SSIM values obtained
by each method for MRI brain image with different sigma, i.e., r = 10, 20, 30, 40,

50, 60, 70. The noise level of the image gradually comes down for the high PSNR
value and the low MSE value. We have analysed that the combined method of
curvelet with Weiner ﬁlter gives the higher PSNR and SSIM value and lower MSE
value compared to other techniques. These are represented graphically in Figs. 1, 2,
and 3, whereas in Fig. 4, the noisy image and resulting images of different methods
corrupted by Gaussian noise with r = 40 are shown. The visual quality of the
image also becomes better in this combined curvelet with Wiener ﬁlter technique.

Conclusion
In this paper, we havestudied wavelet, curvelet, and proposed ﬁltering method and their
effect in terms of the considered assessment parameters. The experimental results show
that curvelet based approach performs better than the wavelet-based method. It also
clearly indicates that curvelet with Wiener ﬁlter method outperforms compared to the
other denoising methods, i.e., Wiener, wavelet, and curvelet. Also, the combined
method does a very good job even when the noise is high as revealed from the exper-
imental results. The curvelet denoising method removes the noise mostly lying in low
frequency subbands, but some of the white Gaussian noise is spread in high frequency
subbands also. So Weiner ﬁlter combined with curvelet transform is used here to
remove that residual noise to some extent and the results were satisfactory.

Epileptic Seizure Detection from EEG
Signals Using Best Feature Subsets Based
on Estimation of Mutual Information
for Support Vector Machines and Naïve
Bayes Classiﬁers
A. Sharmila and P. Geethanjali
Abstract The detection of epileptic abnormality from electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals is achieved using pattern recognition system. In this work, to dis-
tinguish the epileptic seizure from normal EEG signal, pattern recognition is
applied. Novel pattern recognition is studied with the conventional features which
are extracted from discrete wavelet transform (DWT) sub-bands D3-D5 and A5 to
detect epileptic seizure with support vector machine (SVM) and naïve Bayes
(NB) classiﬁer for 14 varying combinations of set A to D with set E. The open
source EEG data which is provided by University of Bonn, Germany, and Christian
Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), India, are used in this work. Further, the
DWT coefﬁcients obtained from D3-D5 to A5 sub-bands increases the computa-
tional burden of the classiﬁer. So, feature selection based on the estimation of
mutual information theory is applied to the DWT coefﬁcients to obtain signiﬁcant
features required for the classiﬁer to get better accuracy with lesser computational
burden. The results show that SVM performs well for 9 data sets and NB performs
better for 4 varying data sets. However, SVM and NB performed equally well in
differentiating normal open EEG and epileptic data and afford an accuracy of 100%.
In using CMCH data, SVM provides 100% accuracy with only top 2 ranked
features.

Introduction
A valuable tool which is proven in the study of conditions whose special effects are
perceptible in the electrical brain activity is an electroencephalogram (EEG).
Epilepsy is a condition which is characterized by spatially well-localized occur-
rence or prevalent transient recurrent seizures observable in the EEG [1]. Nearly,
1% of world population grieves from epilepsy, and it is one of the most common
neurological disorders [2]. Owing to the difﬁculty in seizures prediction, the epi-
lepsy study implicates that recording of the EEG over extensive periods of a few
days continuously. Therefore, an expert must visually analyze huge number of data
to detect the activity associated to epilepsy. To assist the experts in this long and
tiresome process, over the years several attempts have been made to improve
computerized epileptic seizure detection systems. In these systems, different tech-
niques have been taken with varying degrees of success.
The main aim of this study is to recognize a pattern recognition scheme which is
based on best feature subset using estimation of mutual information theory for
efﬁcient seizure detection with NB and SVM classiﬁer with most relevant features.
In this work, for ﬁrst time, an attempt has been made to use the 6 varying data set
combinations such as AC-E, AD-E, BC-E, BD-E, and ABC-E. The study presented
here inspects both openly existing ﬁve EEG data sets A, B, C, D, and E provided by
Department of Epileptology at University of Bonn, Germany [3] and the data sets of
normal and epileptic patients which have been provided by Department of neuro-
science, CMCH, India. Further, in this study, signals have been decomposed into
various sub-bands frequencies using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The three
statistical features such as mean absolute value (MAV), standard deviation (SD),
and average power (AVP) were derived from D3-D5 and A5 of DWT coefﬁcients.
With the intention of avoiding the redundancy of features, the derived features are
ranked and studied using NB and SVM classiﬁer based on top ranked features using
feature selection based on mutual information theory to differentiate the epileptic
signal from non-epileptic signals.
1.1
EEG Data Segmentation
In this work, open source EEG database [3] which is provided by University of
Bonn, Germany, has been used. Also, the EEG data consists of 12 normal and 12
epileptic patients acquired for the duration of 26 s from 29 channels which is
provided by Department of Neuroscience, CMCH, India has been used. The digi-
tized data has a sampling rate of 500 Hz, and it is ﬁltered using band-pass ﬁlter with
the cut-off frequencies of 0.53–100 Hz. In this study, 13,000 samples are segmented
into 6 equal data segments of size 2000 samples; in which, the remaining samples
are discarded in each channel data. Thus, a total of 72 segments are attained from 29
channels data for each normal subject and epileptic patients.

1.2
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
Since the EEG signals are non-stationary, it is difﬁcult to capture frequency content
with time of actions, so in this work, fast Fourier transform (FFT) and time domain
analysis are not preferred. The time-frequency representation using discrete wavelet
transform is preferred in this work to capture frequency content with the time of
occurrence. Five-level wavelet decomposition is done, and statistical features such
as mean absolute value (MAV), standard deviation (SD), and average power
(AVP) which are extracted from the DWT coefﬁcients such as D3, D4, D5, and A5
are considered in this work, because utmost the frequency content necessary for
analyzing the epileptic seizure signal is available in that sub-bands [4].
2
Feature Selection and Ranking
Certain features which are extracted from the DWT coefﬁcients might be redundant,
and hence, they increase the classiﬁer computational burden even if not providing
the information useful for classiﬁcation [5]. So, in this work, to avoid taking
redundant features applied to the classiﬁer, a feature selection based on mutual
information (MI) which provides the top signiﬁcance features based on ranking is
chosen [6]. The estimation of mutual information between features and associated
class labels using quantized feature space has been employed.
2.1
Classiﬁcation
The necessity of the classiﬁer in this pattern recognition system is to detect the
epileptic seizure in EEG data with NB and SVM classiﬁer. These classiﬁers are
used to categorize the epileptic seizure EEG from the other EEG using the derived
DWT statistical features obtained based on feature ranking. A comparison has been
done between the NB and SVM classiﬁers with top ranked to last ranked features.
The classiﬁers are assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, and speciﬁcity. Lesser
training data is required for classiﬁcation using NB than SVM.

Results
This main goal of this pattern recognition study is to detect epileptic seizure from
the EEG signals based on feature selection with relevant leading ranked features. In
this work, pattern recognition system has been developed based on best MAV,
AVP, SD features subsets from D3-D5 to A5. In SVM, 60% of data is used for

training and 40% of data is used for testing data. Whereas, in NB, 20% of data is
used for training and 80% of data is used for testing data in all the 14 varying
combinations.
Table 1 shows the classiﬁcation table of NB and SVM for the ranked features in
the descending order, and Table 2 shows the comparison of these NB and SVM
classiﬁers with highest ranked features. For all the 14 data sets combinations, the
ﬁrst and second ranking features are applied to the classiﬁer, then the next two
ranked i.e. in the order of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 features are applied to classiﬁers. The
performance of NB and SVM is studied using statistical parameters such as clas-
siﬁcation accuracy (CA), sensitivity (SEN), and speciﬁcity (SPEC). Upon feature
selection, the NB performance could be improved with lesser training data. In the
data set combination A-E, the leading 10 ranked features provide 100% classiﬁ-
cation accuracy with NB and the ranked features such as 11 and 12 are not essential
for this data set classiﬁcation, and so it is not required for the classiﬁer, and
therefore, these features are neglected. In case of SVM, with the all 12 ranked
features, 100% CA is attained.
In using the B-E data set combination, the highest CA of 99.58% is obtained
with NB for the leading 6 ranking features and with SVM, the highest CA of
99.12% is achieved using the leading four ranking features. In using the C-E data
set combination, highest CA of 99.12% is achieved with SVM using the leading ten
ranked features, and the highest CA of 99.58% is achieved with NB using all 12
ranking features. In using data sets combination D-E, with SVM, the highest CA of
97% is attained for leading four ranked features and the highest CA of 93.5% is
attained with NB using the leading two ranked features. So, to classify the data set
D-E, NB requires features whereas SVM requires 4 features. In the data set com-
binations AB-E, CA of 99.67% is attained with leading 6 ranked features with NB,
and CA of 99.61% is achieved with SVM for only leading 2 ranked features. In case
of using the data set combination AC-E, CA of 99.55% is accomplished with the
leading 10 features with NB and with SVM, CA of 99.41% is achieved with leading
10 ranked features. In the data set combination AD-E, the CA of 97.83% is
achieved with SVM, and it is 96.67% for only leading 2 ranked features with NB.
The other features are not required for the classiﬁers and therefore it is neglected.
In case of data set combination BC-E, highest CA of 97.94% is attained for
leading 4 ranked features with NB and it is 98.33% with SVM for leading 4 ranked
features. In case of BD-E data set combination, the highest CA of 95.5% is attained
with SVM for leading 10 ranked features and it is 91.44% with NB for leading 8
ranked features. In the data set CD-E combination, using leading 4 ranked features,
the highest CA of 96.19% is achieved with NB and it is 97.58% with SVM for only
leading 2 ranked features. In the data set combinations ABC-E, the highest CA of
98.58% is attained with NB for leading 6 ranked features, and with SVM, it is
98.81% for all the 12 ranked features. In the data set ACD-E combination, the
highest CA of 97.62% is achieved with NB for leading 4 ranked features and CA
98.06% is attained with SVM for the leading 2 ranked features. In the data set
BCD-E combination, the highest CA of 94.04% is attained with NB for leading 4
ranked features and it is 96.68% with SVM for leading 8 ranked features. In case of

the data set ABCD-E combination, with SVM the highest CA of 97.3% is attained
for leading 10 ranked features and it is 95.53% with NB for leading 6 ranked
features. Moreover, the SVM affords better CA, SEN, and SPEC for leading 2
ranked features in using the data sets combinations such as AB-E, AD-E, CD-E,
and ACD-E as shown in Table 2.
From Fig. 1, it is inferred that the average CA of SVM is 98.13% and it is
97.13% with NB for the leading ranked features. SVM is well performed for 9
varying data sets combinations, and NB is well performed for 4 varying data set
combinations. In case of the data set combination A-E, NB and SVM performed
equally with difference in the leading ranked features. In general, performance of
the SVM is well performed to detect the epileptic seizure from EEG signals using
best feature subsets based on mutual information theory. The leading ranked fea-
tures which afford highest CA are the most relevant features for the classiﬁers.
In this work, an attempt has been made to use CMCH database, and the results of
clinical inference are presented in Table 2. From 29 channels, a total of 348 features
are extracted from the coefﬁcients D3-D5 and A5 with 72 segments. Subsequently,
because of 29 channel, there are larger number of features, so initially applied the
feature selection method and obtained feature ranking for each individual features
and the top ranked features in the order of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14. The leading

Conclusions
In this pattern recognition system, the EEG data from normal and epileptic subject
has been analyzed to attain good accuracy with lesser time. The best subset sta-
tistical features of MAV, SD, and AVP derived from DWT coefﬁcients based on
mutual information are important in the detection of epileptic seizure. It has been
inferred from the results that pattern recognition system attains highest accuracy of
100% in using NB and SVM for leading 10 and 12 ranked features for the data set
combination A-E. In CMCH data set, an accuracy of 100% is obtained with SVM
for only leading 4 ranked features and the highest accuracy of 98.86% is achieved
with NB for leading 8 ranked features. This pattern recognition system based on the
leading ranked statistical features from DWT achieves the best accuracy using SVM
classiﬁer for 9 data set combinations and attains best accuracy in NB for 4 data sets
combination, and both SVM and NB provide better accuracy for 1 data set in using
University of Bonn database. It is inferred that SVM is well performed with feature
selection technique, and NB shows improved result with smaller training data.

Intelligent Routing in MANET Using
Self-Adaptive Genetic Algorithm
R.M. Nareshkumar, S. Phanikumar and Manoj Kumar Singh
Abstract At present, communication technology provides support for different
varieties of mobile networks, and among them, mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is
of prime importance and challenging. Topological change with time is the inherent
characteristics in MANET. This occurs either to save the energy or mobility observed
with nodes. Therefore, routing problem under MANET is also dynamic and can be
formulated as a dynamic optimization problem. It is essential that the solution should
have a high level of adaptability to deﬁne dynamic routing. In this paper, high level of
adaptiveness has achieved by designing the different strategies under genetic algo-
rithm like redeﬁnition of solution population, small random perturbation, and sharing
the gained knowledge to current solution. The proposed solution has achieved
optimal routing in a very efﬁcient way under dynamic topology.

Introduction
In all types of networks, quality of routing solution is the prime deciding factor for
overall network performance. Dynamic characteristics of topology in MANET
transform the routing as a dynamic optimization problem. To get the best solution,
it is necessary that high level of adaptiveness should be there. In an informal way,

routing problem under dynamic condition can be deﬁned as: for a pair of nodes as
source and destination in wireless network carries an upper bound of delay and
requirement is to ﬁnd a minimum cost path on a topology graph which is without
loop. Either energy-saving perspective or nodes mobility, there is a change in
topology or objective is to ﬁnd quickly the new optimal minimum cost path which
satisﬁes the delay constraint.
Mathematical formulation of the objective can be represented as: in MANET, G(V,
E). There is a request of unicast routing between a pair of nodes and has been an upper
bound of delay Δ. Routing can be consider as ﬁnding a number of paths fOiji 2
f0; 1; . . .gg sequentially over a set of graph fGiji 2 f0; 1; . . .gg, which must satisfy
the delay constraint as given in (1) and carry the minimum cost path as given in (2).

In practical aspect, dynamic condition of many systems is very natural, and
achieving the optimal solution under the dynamic environment is a very challenging
task. There is need to explore the changing landscape very quickly to have the
optimal solution and track the change over the landscape. Natural computing
methods are based on natural models, hence there is a high level of adaptiveness
inherently exists. Among the various possibilities under natural computing methods
like evolutionary computation, swarm intelligence, are well established and have
shown their usefulness in various applications.
Due to a huge number of applications in practical life, numbers of researchers
have given attention over the dynamic routing problem. Multiple path possibilities
can be achieved through the multipath routing, and for MANET, environment-
related issues have been discussed in [1]. To reduce the communication overhead
and storage demand, [2] has proposed the Fuzzy logic-based routing solution with
consideration of input parameters like delay, signal power, and mobility.
Comparative performance analysis of routing protocol AODV and DSR has been
presented in [3], and their applicability for MANET has also discussed. Routing
which is based on trust has discussed in [4]. Forwarding ratio has been considered
to estimate the direct trust, and indirect trust has been obtained from neighbor’s
recommendation. Based on clustering method, routing for mobile nodes has been
discussed in [5]. For a multiple node pair as source and destination, end-to-end
delay minimization method has been proposed in [6]. Black hole nodes detection or
their effects on routing have been achieved through DSR-based routing in [7].
Achievement of optimal routing path through A-star evaluation function has been
proposed in [8]. Swarm intelligence like ant colony has been applied in [9] to
develop

system.
Energy-efﬁcient routing algorithms can increase the life span of WSNs; hence it is

very important that routing solution should take care in the estimation of optimal
path of routing. In [10], orientations toward homogeneous and heterogeneous
WSNs-based classiﬁcation of existing routing algorithms from energy efﬁciency
perspective have been discussed.

Proposed Solution
To obtain minimum distance, we have designed various adaptive forms of genetic
algorithms like redeﬁnition of population in genetic algorithm (RGA), random
perturbations in genetic algorithms (PGA), and knowledge-based genetic algo-
rithms (KGA). In MANETs, there are a number of applications where dynamic
topology exists, for example, in the case of track animals, soldier strategy in war
ﬁeld. In natural systems, evolution can be considered as the best example of
adaptability, hence genetic algorithm platform has taken to develop the solutions,
but the existing challenge is to ﬁnd the optimal connectivity quickly for a change in
topology. To handle all these issues, in this research, three different approaches
have been developed: (a) apply a completely new solution population with event,
(b) keep applying a small amount of perturbation in population, and (c) use the
knowledge of some previous better solutions to the current population. To simulate
the MANET, a deﬁned range of area is decided, and nodes position can be rep-
resented through the uniformly distributed random number on X coordinate and
Y coordinate direction. Connectivity between nodes is decided through the esti-
mation of Euclidean distance on the communication range.

GA with Redeﬁne Population on Time (RGA)
To handle the change, a completely new population, which has a high level of
diversity introduced at the time of change, is observed. The pseudo-code for RGA
has given below.

GA with Continuous Perturbation (PGA)
A new member is always incorporated in the population of each iteration to have
better diversity so that under dynamic condition a better solution could explore.
With this approach, it is possible to handle dynamic conditions faster and free from
event detection procedure. The pseudo-code for PGA has given below.

GA with Sharing Knowledge (KGA)
If there is a possibility to use the knowledge available with some previous gener-
ation best solutions to current generation, there is a very good chance to handle
dynamic topology in an efﬁcient manner because they may have the knowledge to
handle the change in the topology with the time, in result the optimal solutions can
be achieved with very less time and chances of failure are minimized. The
pseudo-code for KGA has given below.

Experimental Design
Simulation experiments have done in MATLAB environment. A set of 50 nodes
has been applied in experiment in square region, having area of 200  200 square
unit. The communication range of each node has taken as 50 units and after esti-
mation of Euclidean distance from each node to all other nodes, topology con-
nectivity decides. For all the experimental case, size of population is taken as 50.
Crossover has applied with 1 probability if it is feasible else equal to zero. Mutation
has applied with 0.1 probabilities.
6.1
Chromosome Representation
We have applied a constraint-based deﬁnition in an initial population deﬁnition of
routing path to a desired source and destination. Following steps have been applied
in the representation of chromosomes:
(i)
Deﬁne the source sensor as starting number.
(ii)
Obtain the possible neighbors.
(iii)
Apply uniform random process to select a connected sensor among possible
neighbors.
(iv)
If selected node is not a destination sensor, add the selected sensor as the
next node in routing path.
(v)
Repeat the process from (ii), until the destination source does not meet.
6.2
Connectivity-Based Crossover Operator and Mutation
In MANETs, it is not possible to deﬁne the crossover over the length of solution at
any arbitrary position, because if there is no connectivity exists with immediate
neighbors, it will become unfeasible solution. It is again not possible to compensate
the quality of unfeasibility through any penalty approach, as it applies for most
other types of problem. We have designed the crossover operation through an
attractor approach, which is not based on similar position in solution, instead it is
based on node connectivity, where possible distribution of connectivity is
exchanged. These attractors are the common nodes available in both parents’
solutions. Among possible locations of attractors, one location is selected randomly
to form the offspring.
As shown in Fig. 1, parents P1 and P2 have taken for crossover. There are two
attractors available in chromosomes (N3, N2) and (N2, N6), where the ﬁrst position
(like N3) is the position from 1st parent and a second position (N2) is the position
from second parent. Other positions are not allowed to crossover, because they will

599

make the solution unfeasible. It is also observed that crossover can cause the change
in chromosome length. In this paper, possible domain of change under mutation
with each node is the possible number of nodes, which are connected with their
neighbors only.
In the simulated network as shown in Fig. 2, three different topology changes
have been applied by different events. Topology corresponding to third event has
shown in Fig. 3. These topology changes have occurred at the 10th, 20th, and 30th
unit of time. Different algorithms, RGA, PGA, and KGA, have been applied to ﬁnd
the routing path between node numbers 11 and 49. Topological changes have been
applied at the same time independently for all algorithms. Corresponding to
topology 3, convergence characteristics have shown in Figs. 4, 5, and 6.
Performances of obtaining routing path for all three topologies corresponding to
different events have shown in Table 1. It is observed that every time there is the
largest cost of the route appeared by RGA and more time required achieving the
ﬁnal value. Performances of KGA are always better in terms of low-cost route and
time required to get new route once changes take place in topology.

high level of change occurs in topology, it may difﬁcult to ﬁnd the optimal solutions
within a time span by the PGA. KGA has shown the superior results in all cases in
terms of the high level of adaptive characteristics and faster exploration of the
global solution. This is possible because of experience from the past event helps to
handle the new event better manner, if it occurs.

Comparison of Various Decoding
Algorithms for EG-Low Density
Parity Check Codes
J. Chinna Babu, C. Chinnapu Reddy and M.N. Giri Prasad
Abstract he latest advancements in low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes have
been resulted in reducing the decoding complexity. Hence, these codes have
excelled over turbo codes, BCH codes, and linear block codes in terms of evalu-
ating the performance in higher decoding rate; hence, these decodable codes are the
trending topic in coding theory of signals. Construction of LDPC codes is being
elaborated in this proposed paper which further helps to study decoding and
encoding of these binary and non-binary low-density parity-check codes, respec-
tively. In this proposed design architecture, we have considered the SBF and
MLDD algorithms employed here utilize reliability estimation to improve error
performance and it has advantages over bit ﬂipping (BF) algorithms. This algorithm
can be improved with still more security level by having a trade-off between
performance and data transmission. It can also be enhanced by implementing it in
real-time applications for data decoding and correction, for smaller-size datum.

receiver to obtain the relevant information. Various error decoding schemes are
selected, depends on the occurance of error types. Based on the rate of occurance of
errors, we may consider the communication channel. This Channel deals that,
whether the data retransmission is possible or not [1].
LDPC codes are the linear error decoding and correcting codes, where LDPC
codes represent low-density parity-check codes. Here, the term ‘low density’ replies
to one of the characteristic parity-check matrix H, which may contain only few
numbers of ones in comparison with zeros. These low-density parity-check codes
are undoubtedly the best error detection and correction codes in existence at present
scenario. The parity data or redundant data is added to the original message so that
the original message can be decoded at the receiver end without the need for the
data retransmission and also the errors can be detected and corrected if any errors
are present. Such codes are called error-correcting codes (ECCs) or forward
error-correcting codes (FECs) [2–4].
Error-correcting codes are usually classiﬁed as two types:
• Convolution codes: The codes which are using convolution process are being
processed based on the bit after bit mechanism.
• Block codes: The codes which are using blocking process are being processed
based on the block after block mechanism.
LDPC codes are deﬁned by a sparse parity-check matrix and also by Tanner
graph.
2
Matrix Representation
Hence, these LDPC codes which are proposed are functionally represented by a
sparse matrix, which is having parity information. This well-deﬁned matrix rep-
resented by H is generated by a random process and it was subjected to the sparse
constraints. An LDPC code was deﬁned by the parity-check H-matrix which
indicates null space and it was deﬁned with the following speciﬁed properties.
• Each of the rows may contain p many number of ones.
• Each of the columns may contain r many number of zeros.
• The number of ones in among any two preceded columns which are common,
denoted by lambda and it is not greater than one.
• Both of these numbers of ones p and zeros r are less, compared with the variable
code length size and number of the available rows in parity matrix H. Since
these numbers of ones p and zeros r are very less, sparse parity matrix H has less
number of ones, and therefore, it is a sparse parity-check matrix. Hence, the
code is speciﬁed by a parity-based matrix H and it is often known as a
low-density parity-check code, and it can be speciﬁed by a matrix.

The size of the above matrix is n  k = 8  4, which means there are ‘n’
number of variable nodes and ‘k’ number of check nodes.
2.1
Tanner Graph Representation
The above mentioned graph contains number of variable nodes are ‘n’ and number
of check nodes are ‘k’. The connection between variable node and check node
exists, if the element of nth column and kth row of H-matrix has one.
There are two types of LDPC codes:
1. Binary LDPC codes: These are irregular low-density parity-check codes as the
row weights and column weights are different.
2. Non-binary LDPC codes: All the rows and columns have equal weights. Hence,
these are regular LDPC codes.
The above matrix is considered as (wr, k) where wr = 2 is row weight and k = 3.
Figure 1 indicates the parity-check matrix H with dimensions n  m. This matrix is
represented for a (8, 4) code. The Tanner graph is a bipartite representation of
H-matrix, where c-nodes (f0, f1, f2, f3) are called check nodes or node constraints
and v-nodes (c0-c7) are called variable nodes. This check node indicates fi, and it is
mapped to the v-node cj, if the element hij of low-density parity-check matrix H is
one [5–8].

Decoding of LDPC Codes
Many algorithms are developed for decoding and encoding of both binary and
non-binary
LDPC
codes
based
on
soft-decision-decoding
(SDD)
and
hard-decision-decoding (HDD) schemes. The generic block diagram of decoding
algorithm for LDPC codes is as shown in Fig. 2 [1, 2].
The basic procedure for decoding of low-density codes includes the following
steps.
• Check node issues some constraints to the variable v-nodes.
• If the variable v-nodes satisfy these constraints, the input code to decoder is
assumed to be true and transmits that data to the output.
• Else the error is detected and corrected and is then passed to the output.
The scheme used for decoding and encoding of LDPC codes is an iterative
process. The algorithms considered in this paper for comparison are soft-bit ﬂipping
(SBF) algorithm, majority logic decoder/detector (MLDD) algorithm.
3.1
Soft-Bit Flipping (SBF) Decoder Algorithm
Soft-bit ﬂipping algorithm is the most efﬁcient one among several decoding algo-
rithms. This SBF algorithm has good error performance and it has less hardware
complexity.
The following steps give the procedure for decoding of LDPC codes using SBF
algorithm

1. The parity-check sums are the constraints made by check nodes to be satisﬁed
by variable nodes. The resulting bits are called syndrome bits. If all the com-
puted syndrome bits are zero represents that all parity-check equations are to be
satisﬁed, then the decoding process was halted.
2. The syndrome bits which resulted ones are detected for each of the bit code
position, denotes fi where i = 0 to n −1.
3. The proportional set of bits X with maximum value of (fi) should be identiﬁed.
4. The proportional bits in set X should be complemented.
5. Steps from 1 to 4 should be repeated until entire syndrome bits become zero. At
this stage, the iterations are stopped.
In this paper, Fig. 3 shows the serial hybrid SBF decoder. The decoder consists
of buffer input (which holds the code bits), a rollback buffer (which holds the result
of ﬂipped bits), a buffer output (holds the error-free code bits), check nodes, vari-
able nodes, a ﬂip unit (ﬂips the bits when the constraints are not met), a variable
node processing unit (VPU), and a check node processing unit (CPU), where shift
registers (shifts the bits as the iteration progresses) are used [9–12].

3.2
Majority Logic Decoder/Detector (MLDD) Algorithm
Majority logic decoder/detector algorithm acts as an error detector and corrector
with reduced number of iterations than MLD algorithm. This algorithm is appli-
cable for binary LDPC codes [13–15] (Fig. 4).
The computational procedure for MLDD decoding algorithm is given by the
following procedural steps.
1. The code word is stored in the cyclic shift register.
2. At each tap, the check sums are calculated by the XOR matrix, which are the
constraints provided by check nodes to the variable nodes.
3. After all the check sums are calculated, the majority gate decides whether the
output bits are majority ones or zeros.
4. If more number of zeros is there, then the input bit is considered to be true and
the data is rotated and same process continues for 3 cycles. If all are true, the
data is assumed to be correct and is forwarded to the output.
5. If more number of ones is there, then the bit under operation is complemented
and rotated. Check sums are again calculated, and the process repeats until the
entire check-sum equations are zeros.

Conclusion
The good error-correcting capabilities of geometric LDPC codes are gaining more
prominence in many ﬁelds. As the technology is advancing, many decoding
algorithms for the LDPC codes have been developed. In this chapter, the soft-bit
ﬂipping (SBF) algorithm and majority logic decoder/detector (MLDD) algorithm
for decoding LDPC codes have been investigated and the results obtained by
simulating and synthesizing are compared in terms of hardware consumption and
delay. From these results, it is concluded that hardware complexity of min-sum
algorithm is higher than that of MLDD algorithm and SBF algorithm. SBF decoder
requires less hardware components than other. Whereas the delay is less for MLDD
algorithm followed by SBF decoder. Considering hardware complexity, speed, and
power consumption, the best decoder can be selected according to the application.

Development of a System for Quantitative
Assessment of Vocal Loading
P. Mahalakshmi, Ritwik Dhawan, Kartik Bharadwaj
and Milind Kar Ray
Abstract Great vocal well-being is a key worry to proﬁcient voice clients such ad
instructors and artists. Consequently, to improve the utilization of voice and
appropriate recovery to reestablish vocal well-being is the need of the day.
A framework has been created to give a way to quantitative vocal stacking appraisal
for the avoidance of voice issues. The advancements in signal processing have
helped us to achieve this goal. Time dose, cycle dose, energy dose, and distance
dose are the vital voice dosage measures citied in writing. The initial two mea-
surements are ascertained in the study. The parameters which determine these
measurements are voicing time, fundamental frequency of speech, and intensity of
speech. Silence/unvoiced/voiced classiﬁcation of speech signal has been done. The
fundamental frequency has been extracted by cepstrum analysis. Voice doses are
calculated using the above parameters, and tests are done on male and female audio
samples. In this study, MATLAB platform is used for speech signal recording as
well as analysis.

Introduction
As per World Health Organization measurements, discourse and dialect issue
unfavorably inﬂuence the relational abilities of no less than 3.5% of the human
populace [1]. The level of disarranges ﬂuctuates from mellow weaknesses like
elocution mistakes to more serious ones including listening to misfortune, aphasia,
and cranial–facial inconsistencies. A discourse issue alludes to the trouble in
comprehension or assembling words to impart thoughts.
Around 25% of the US populace is occupied with work that is “vocally
requesting,” and it is watched that they create visit voice issues [2]. Cases of experts
with overwhelming vocal requests incorporate educators, artists, legal counselors,
salespeople, heart stimulating exercise teachers, on-screen characters, and assem-
bling administrators. These experts require over the top vocalization or talk louder
than a higher clamor level to be heard accurately. Aside from the above issue, the
ecological contamination, sudden changes in dampness, or presentation to phar-
macological operators can make vocal overlay tissues bothered or powerless against
harm. While in some cases, certain disease or damage may obstruct the vocal folds
or larynx. Consequently, there is a need to quantify the measure of voice use among
these experts and to screen the event of the voice issues keeping in mind the end
goal to set up word-related security limits. In this manner, a superior mechanical
answer for voice estimation is completely essential in the present situation.

Theoretical Background
2.1
Speech Production
From ﬂag-situated perspective, the generation of discourse is generally depicted as
a two-level process [3]. At ﬁrst, the sound is started and it is sifted on the second
level [4]. The creation of discourse is viewed as a superposition of start, phonation,
verbalization, and prosodic association forms [5].
2.2
Source Filtering
The source ﬁlter model explains that the spoken word is comprised of a source
component originating from the vocal cords which is then shaped by a ﬁlter imi-
tating the work of vocal tract [6]. Figure 1 shows this concept.

P. Mahalakshmi et al.

The source is a signal x(t) which is fed to the ﬁlter. Here, the input is called the
excitation signal, and ﬁlter refers to the vocal tract which acts as a linear
time-invariant system with the impulse response h(t). It is also the speech transfer
function since it adds voice to the words. The speech is the output y(t) which is
simply a convolution of the source signal x(t) with the ﬁlter’s input response h(t) as
stated below in (1).

ð1Þ
2.3
Vocal Dose Measures
The trauma to vocal fold tissue caused by loud or prolonged vocalization can be
thought as an exposure problem over time which is generally quantiﬁed by dose [7].
The term “vocal dosimetry” has been adapted to the occupational voice problems
caused by long-term exposure of the vocal fold tissues to vibration. The important
vocal dose measures are time dose, distance dose, cycle dose, and energy dose
[7]. The parameters needed to compute these dose measures are the voicing time
and the fundamental frequency of speech.
• Time Dose
Time dose (Dt) is the measure of total time in seconds during which the vocal folds
are vibrating and is deﬁned as follows:
Dt ¼
Z
Kvdt
ð2Þ
where the limits are from 0 to t and t represents the total time for which the speech
is recorded and Kv is voicing step function.
• Distance Dose
Distance dose (Dd) is the accumulated distance traversed by the vocal folds in a
vibratory trajectory and is deﬁned as follows:
Dd ¼
Z
Kv 4A
ð
ÞF0dt
ð3Þ
where A is the vocal fold vibration amplitude, with 4A being the distance traveled
by the vocal fold tissue in the vibratory cycle, and F0 is the fundamental frequency
of speech.
• Cycle Dose
Cycle dose (Dc) is the measure of the accumulated number of oscillations of the
vocal folds and is deﬁned as follows:
Development of a System for Quantitative Assessment …
617

Dc ¼
Z
KvF0dt
ð4Þ
• Energy Dose
Energy dose (Dc) is the measure of the amount of energy dissipated as heat in the
vocal fold during vibration and is deﬁned as follows
De ¼ 0:5
Z
KvgðA=TÞ2x2dt
ð5Þ
where η is the viscosity of the vocal fold tissue, T is the thickness of the vibrating
part of the glottis, and x ¼ 2 * p * F0 is the angular frequency.

Methodology and Implementation
The aim is to extract relevant parameters namely speech signal intensity, RMS
value of the signal, fundamental frequency, and voicing time and then subsequently
calculate the above-mentioned doses. Figure 2 explains the steps involved in signal
processing. First, the signal acquisition takes place, and then, this signal is fed for
pre-emphasis where the power of high-energy frequencies is boosted for enhancing
the signal. After this, the signal is taken in segmented frames and the frames are
windowed smoothly. The short-time energy analysis is done, and RMS value of the
signal is estimated. Based on the energy received, the signal is classiﬁed as S/UV/V
(silence/unvoiced/voiced).

P. Mahalakshmi et al.

Finally, the fundamental frequency of the speech is determined by means of
cepstrum analysis. Using this frequency, the cycle dose and time dose are plotted
for further analysis and recommendation for the test subject.
3.1
Speech Signal Acquisition
Signal acquisition is achieved through a head-mounted microphone which is fed
into the computer and stored as (.wav) ﬁle in MATLAB software for analysis. Since
human speech signals fall mostly below 4 kHz, a sampling frequency of 8 kHz is
used to extract all the necessary data from the speech signal.
3.2
Pre-emphasis
Due to the nature of glottal pulse, a drop in energy is seen across the high fre-
quencies as compared to the low frequencies. Therefore, a boost is needed for these
high frequencies in order to improve the speech recognition accuracy which is done
by pre-emphasis which is basically a technique to increase the energy of the high
frequencies and spectrally ﬂatten signal. It is similar to ﬁrst-order FIR ﬁltering, and
the transfer function is given by (6).

ð6Þ
where H(z) is the transfer function, a is the pre-emphasis factor, and its typical value
is 0.95.
3.3
Framing and Windowing
The speech being a non-stationary signal, the speech analysis is therefore carried
out on short segments having each frame of 32 ms (256 samples) with adjacent
frames being separated by 1 sample each. Consecutively, a smoothing window is
applied to each segment to reduce the edge effect. The Hamming window is used
which tapers the signal to zero at the beginning and end of each frame. Hamming
window is described by (7).

ð7Þ
where 0 < n < (N −1) and N = 256 (frame size).
3.4
Short-Time Energy
An automatic classiﬁcation for the S/UV/V signal is achieved which is based on the
energy content in the signal. The energy content is found using short-time energy
(En) which is deﬁned as (8).
En ¼

ðx½m; w½n  mÞ2
ð8Þ
This energy is computed every point in the input data, and a decision is made for
each point accordingly. The signal with zero energy is classiﬁed as silence (S), the
signal with energy less than 0.5 is classiﬁed as unvoiced signal, whereas the signal
with energy ranging from 0.5 to 1 corresponds to voiced signal. The RMS (root
mean square) value is also estimated.
3.5
Fundamental Frequency Estimation
A dependable approach to get a gauge of the prevailing principal recurrence for the
long, spotless, stationary discourse signs is to utilize the cepstrum. The cepstrum is a
Fourier investigation of the logarithmic plentifulness range of the ﬂag. In the event
620
P. Mahalakshmi et al.

that the log sufﬁciency range contains numerous standard music, then the Fourier
examination of the range will demonstrate a pinnacle contrasting with the isolating
between the music, i.e., the key recurrence. Viably, the ﬂag range is dealt with as
another ﬂag, and after that, the periodicity in the range itself is searched for. The
x-hub of the cepstrum has units of quefrency, and crests in the cepstrum are called
rahmonics. To get a gauge of the essential recurrence from the cepstrum, we search
for a crest in the quefrency locale to average discourse central frequencies [8].

The sample speech is taken in MATLAB software as (.wav) ﬁle as shown in

Figure 4 shows the short-time energy plot of the above sample speech.
The fundamental frequency extraction has been performed as shown in the
Fig. 5. The peak in the cepstrum corresponds to the fundamental frequency
(200 Hz) for that segment of speech.
The Goldilocks section has customarily been utilized by specialists for voice
assessments when vast varieties in power, principal recurrence, and voice quality are
required [9]. We have used a portion of the passage, and the same is given below.
Once upon a time, there lived three bears. They lived in the woods. One of the bears was
papa bear. One was mama bear, and one was baby bear.

Conclusion
The system presented here has been developed for vocal dose measurement which
allows measurement of the time dose and the cycle dose. The important parameters
used to decide these doses are voicing time and fundamental frequency of speech.
The criterion used for distinguishing voice segments from unvoiced and silence is
the energy level of the speech. The fundamental frequency is estimated by cepstrum
analysis of the signal. We hope that these parameters will help ﬁgure out a safe limit
for vocal use and to determine the amount of recovery time needed once this safe
limit is exceeded. Hopefully, these measures can be related to vocal fatigue among
people in vocally demanding professions. In future, study can be extended for
calculation of energy dose and distance dose, incorporating a sound pressure level
meter in the data acquisition system and with proper calibration procedures.

Abstract A new approach applying particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ﬁreﬂy
algorithm (FA) has been proposed for solving economic dispatch and multi-area
unit commitment problems, in this paper. In FA, the ﬂashing behavior depends on
the random movement factor, which gets ﬁxed and causes the solution to vary
uncertainly. Hence, PSO algorithm is used to optimize the random movement factor
of FA. Using the proposed PSO-based FA, the ON/OFF status of generating units
of multi-area system is determined. The effective equality and inequality constraints
are considered to solve the multi-area system. The proposed algorithm is imple-
mented in MATLAB working platform and is applied to four areas with 26 gen-
erating unit systems for a 24-h schedule. The performance of proposed method has
been compared with other recent reported results. The implication of proposed
method is clariﬁed and veriﬁed by numerical results.

Introduction
The load of a practical power network varies persistently, and thus it is not prudent
to use all the units needed to fulﬁll the peak loads [1]. Power system must be gone
about as an essential reliable component to supply the load [2]. From the reliable
point of view, unit commitment (UC) plays a real part in the everyday operation,
arranging and controlling techniques of powerful networks [3, 4]. It is the deter-
mination of the optimum operating on a schedule of various electric power pro-
duction units, in addition to meet the determined demand over a transient period,
with the minimum total operating cost [5–10]. Commonly, it is mentioned as a
varied combinatorial and nonlinear improvement issue with substantial measure-
ments and coupling constraints [11–13]. Different strategies, for example, dynamic
programming, sequential system, genetic calculations, unit de-commitment strate-
gies, mixed integer program, and expert frameworks have been utilized for UC
issues [14–16]. Despite precisely a power pool that included a few generation areas
connected using tie-lines, destination is to attain the cost-effective generation policy
that would provide the conﬁned demand without damaging tie-line limit require-
ments [17]. This is called as Multi-Area Unit Commitment (MAUC) optimization
issues.
MAUC issues are expanding with the number of constraints, measurements and
several areas. In the event that there are no restrictions for exchanging power
between interconnected areas, the power pool might be considered as an extensive
single area and MAUC would be simple [18]. It enhances the market proﬁciency
and framework reliability by imparting the assets crosswise area limits [19].
The MAUC schedule was optimized, wherein the basic necessity list plan was
actualized, employing minimal path, maximal ﬂow technique, which is generally
created to tackle transportation issue. Analogous to single area UC (SAUC),
numerically, MAUC’s goal capacity is to minimize the aggregate expense of
working all units over a speciﬁed time horizon. The aggregate working expense
includes fuel expenses, operation and maintenance charge (OMC), and start-up
expenses, with the transmission losses being consolidated in the incremental cost
rate evaluation [20].
This paper describes a modiﬁed FA for solving multi-area unit commitment
problem. Here, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the
random movement factor and the performance of FA is improved. The multi-area
unit commitment problem has been formulated in such a way to reduce the total
system operating cost. The proposed method is used for computing the allocation of
generation of units in hourly basis to get optimal value. This paper is organized as
follows: Sect. 1 analyzes recent research work; Sect. 2 discusses problem forma-
tion and the proposed method; Sect. 3 depicts the results; and Sect. 4 concludes the
paper.

Problem Formulation for MAUC
The main objective function of the MAUC problem is to minimize the total
operating cost of entire generation, simultaneously satisfying the load demand.
The total operating cost involves start-up cost, shutdown cost, and fuel cost. The
fuel cost equation is in general a quadratic equation of power output of every
generating unit, at each hour. The start-up cost of each generator is an expo-
nential function of the time that the unit remains off. MAUC is used for com-
mitment schedule of the generators in multiple areas which are connected
through tie-lines.

Multi-Area Economic Dispatch
The aim of multi-area economic dispatch (MAED) is to ﬁnd out the allocation of
generation of every unit in the system and transfer of power among the areas such
that the total production cost is minimum. The objective is to select gsys each hour
to reduce the operation cost. The actual output value generated in unit m has
determined the system incremental production cost through minimum and maxi-
mum generation coordination, and it will not work in shut down mode.

For area h, the area gh satisﬁes the generation requirement to attain the optimal

the maximum production cost for unit m; and gh,the production cost of area h.
2.4
Tie-Line Constraints
As a rule, tie-line parameters are estimated by the transportation model. However, it
is inappropriate for multi-area unit commitment and hence we have made use of the
quadratic cost function. In fact, tie -line ﬂows are not directly linked to the gen-
eration of area to tackle the tie-line constraints; area g iterations are located within
630
S. Prabakaran et al.

the gsys iteration loop. In each and every gsys iteration, Eqs. (10), (11), (13), and
(14) are veriﬁed to assess the operation mode of each and every area. In case the
generation of area h, Ph
n, does not fall within the gamut of coordination range
prescribed by Eq. (21), the area is likely to function either at the upper or the lower
limit mode, and in accordance with Eqs. (24) and (25), the g employed in the area
would be dissimilar from gsys. The local g iterations are carried out among the
dedicated units in area h till the area generation approaches the speciﬁc bounds.
In MAUC, the system generating the balance equation simplify the real power
loss with the outside system to zero from Eq. (5), therefore

ð25Þ
The cost-effective area may have more power above the demand, and the
unnecessary additional power gets transferred through tie-lines. Further, it may
cause certain export losses, and then the excess power is transferred to other areas.
Due to the power balance equation, there may be a little power deﬁcit and it
requires certain generation imports. The minimum power generation level in these
areas is the local demand less the amount of capacities in all the tie-lines. When the
tie-lines are attached to an area having higher deﬁcit, the direction of ﬂow gets
reversed.

Modiﬁed Fireﬂy Algorithm to Solve the Formulated
MAUC Problem
PSO-based modiﬁed ﬁreﬂy algorithm is proposed in this paper, for solving an
optimization task of MAUC problem. PSO algorithm is applied to optimize the
randomization parameter of ﬁreﬂy, and the performance of the algorithm is
enhanced. Using the PSO algorithm, a set of at values generated and the best value
is selected by which at give minimum unit generator deviation. Therefore, the
algorithm could converge to the optimum solution more quick by reducing the
randomness. The steps of proposed modiﬁed FA are explained as follow,
The PSO algorithm requires the parameters followed below:
(i)
Maximum and minimum velocity that limit viðtÞ within the range.
(ii)
An inertial weight w.
(iii)
Two random numbers r1 and r2 which decide the inﬂuence of piðtÞ and giðtÞ
on the velocity updation.
(iv)
Two multipliers C1 and C2.

Results and Discussion
The proposed multi-area unit problem was formulated which was solved by the
PSO-based ﬁreﬂy algorithm. The proposed method was implemented in MATLAB
working platform, and the performance was evaluated with four area thermal
generating system. In the test system, every area comprises of 26 generators, which
have the start-up cost functions and generating cost functions. The dataset of the
units is listed in [17]. The cost functions of the generators are categorized by sliding
order since the generating units of the four areas are some extent different. The
implementation parameters of proposed PSO-based ﬁreﬂy algorithm are given in
Table 1. Bar chart of load demand of four area system is illustrated in Fig. 1.
Using the above demand proﬁle, the total operating cost of multi-area system is
calculated for each hour of a day using the ﬁreﬂy and PSO-based ﬁreﬂy algorithm.
The convergences performance of FA is the proposed method illustrated in
Fig. 2. The proposed method takes very less iteration to reach the minimum ﬁtness
value when compared with FA. Therefore, convergence performance is also con-
ﬁrmed the effectiveness of proposed method. Moreover, the computational times of
FA and PSO-based FA are observed for calculating a solution of the problem which
is given in Table 2. The FA has less elapsed time to check the constraints. But, the
proposed method takes more computational time to FA but the solution is accurate
when compared with FA.

Conclusion
A PSO-based FA was proposed for selecting minimum operating cost of multi-area
unit commitment problem. The proposed method was implemented, and the per-
formance was tested four areas with 26 generating unit systems for a 24-h schedule.
Then, the total operating cost is calculated and compared for proposed method, FA,
PSO, EP, and DP. From that, the proposed method obtained minimum operating
cost as 2540439.466 $ without violating the system demand with the computational
time as 58 s. Moreover, the numerical results are conﬁrmed and the proposed
method effectively solves the multi-area unit commitment problem. The future
research will focus on introducing new optimization algorithm and incorporating
more operational consideration of transmission constraints.

Wi-Fi-Based Low-Cost Monitoring
of ECG and Temperature Parameters
Using Arduino and ThingSpeak
Kartik Bharadwaj, Ritwik Dhawan, Milind Kar Ray
and P. Mahalakshmi
Abstract Health monitoring is one of the most important parameters to diagnose a
patient, and it can be done in many ways. Temperature monitoring and pulse rate of
a patient is one of the ways. Temperature sensor and pulse rate sensor have been
used to get the physiological data from a patient’s body. These data can be used to
monitor the health of the patient. The acquired data is then sent to a website server
from which the doctors can check the patient’s vital signs anytime. Therefore,
low-cost monitoring can be used in remote areas where people are not able to afford
the healthcare. Future improvement can be done by sending an email containing the
status of the health parameters to the doctor in case of emergency.

Introduction
Technology deﬁnes the twenty-ﬁrst century in an apt way. Mobile and Internet have
become the heart and soul of today’s global scenario. From social networking to
media outreach, from military to medical ﬁelds, all have become an integral part of
the Internet. Many hospitals and modern healthcare clinics in urban cities have
state-of-the-art medical instruments. Though the cost of these instruments is high, it
does provide accurate medical information about a patient’s body. This, therefore,
saves time and patient’s life too. But, due to alarming rate in the health effects of

patients, doctors are now busier than ever. This reduces the attention span given to
each patient and sometimes may also lead to unavailability of doctors in critical
times. Also, the ever increasing cost of medical devices restricts access to people in
remote areas.
In medicine, checking is the perception of an infection, condition, or one or a
few medicinal parameters after some time. It can be performed by consistently
measuring certain parameters by utilizing a medicinal screen nearby screen and
additionally by more than once performing restorative tests. The process of wire-
lessly transmitting the patient’s data from one station to a remote station is termed
as biotelemetry. Remote healthcare system (RHS) is a healthcare system that makes
the patient to use a portable medical setup to perform a standard check-up and
report the patient’s data to a healthcare expert instantly. The data is sent to the
doctor by using a software application installed on the patient’s electronic device
such as computer, smart phone, or tablet [1]. Remote human services framework
has begun to end up a captivating point among specialists, medicinal professionals,
designs, and also IT organizations. In any case, the use of remote medicinal services
framework where doctors can screen patient’s well-being parameters by means of
remote correspondence is accessible just in a couple of nations. Remote medicinal
services framework is useful and invaluable to the patients and territories where the
execution of these frameworks will spare patient’s healing facility costs, holding up
time, and manage trafﬁcs at the doctor’s facility [1]. Our research aims to develop a
low-cost healthcare system which is affordable for people of developing and under
developed countries [2].

Materials and Methods
2.1
Measuring the Patient’s Body Temperature Using LM35
An age-old rudimentary indicator of patient’s health is his/her temperature. The
body’s temperature has the ability to generate heat. The ordinary human body
temperature depends on the level of action, time, and place of the body where
assessment is made [3]. For measuring patient’s temperature, LM35 temperature
sensor is utilized. LM35 identiﬁes temperatures in the range (−55 to +150 °C). The
yield voltage of LM35 is directly corresponding to temperature in Celsius [4]. The
formula utilized for voltage–temperature change of LM35 is given demonstrated as
follows,

A contrasting option to LM35 is thermistor which is a nonlinear gadget, and
because of its good accuracy, high efﬁciency, low cost, and stability, it is used in
most of temperature measuring instruments [4]. Mostly, bead-type thermistors are
used. Equation for resistance measurement is,

2.2
Measurement of Heartbeat Pulse
Heartbeat pulse is one of the deciding factors of the patient’s health. The ECG
signal is divided into many intervals i.e. P, PQ, QRS, ST, and U intervals. A small
variation in any one of the intervals represents a speciﬁc heart disease. One of the
simple ways to check is through the BPM, also known as, beats per minute. BPM is
derived with the help of R-R interval. Figure 1 shows the Arduino connected with
temperature sensor LM35.
Heart Rate HR
ð
Þ ¼ 60= R-R Interval
ð
Þbpm
ð3Þ
The normal heart rate of a human being is 72 bpm, and if the heart rate goes
below 60 bpm, it will be called bradycardia, and if it goes above 100 bpm, it is
called tachycardia. Therefore, to ﬁnd the heartbeat, the pulse sensor which is
depicted in Fig. 2 is used. Pulse sensor, using IR led and phototransistor, detects the
sudden ﬂow in blood during the heartbeat.
The above values were displayed on software named Processing. Processing is a
ﬂexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the
context of the visual arts [5].

2.3
ECG Signal Acquisition and Filtering
ECG signal is extracted from a patient’s body using 3 lead electrodes (Fig. 3).
Conﬁguration 2 was followed. From this arrangement, two of the terminals are
connected to the inverting and non-inverting terminals of Instrumentation Ampliﬁer
INA128. Output from INA128 is passed through a notch ﬁlter which eliminates the
50 Hz AC supply noise. After eliminating the noise, it is passed through low-pass
ﬁlter with cut-off frequency of 150 Hz. This gives the ﬁltered ECG signal. It is
further passed into an Op-Amp 741 which ampliﬁes the signal. The ampliﬁed signal
is sent through Arduino for further processing.

Arduino/Genuino Uno is a printed circuit board integrated with a multi-purpose
microcontroller Atmega328, designed for the incorporation of various sensors and
modules for effective data acquisition. The Arduino Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) is an embedded system application written in Java program-
ming language and can be combined with Processing IDE and other wiring projects.
It has 14 digital I/O pins of which 6 pins can be used PWM purpose, 6 analog
inputs, a 16 MHz external quartz crystal oscillator, a type B USB connection, a
12 V power jack, an In-Circuit Serial Programming (ICSP) header, and an inbuilt
reset button.
In our system, we connect it to a laptop with a USB type A cable or power it with
an 12 V adapter to get started. In most research applications, use of Arduino for data
acquisition and data analyzing is quite easy and cost-effective (Figs. 4 and 5).
A power supply pf 9 V is given through a voltage regulator of 5 V. The elec-
trodes’ input is given to Vin−and Vin+ of the Instrumentation Ampliﬁer INA128.
Output from Instrumentation Ampliﬁer is passed through a notch ﬁlter to eliminate
50 Hz noise from the AC supply. It is then passed through low-pass ﬁlter of cut-off
frequency of 150 Hz. Filter output is passed through IC 741 to amplify the output.
This is then passed to Arduino.
2.4
Sending Data Through Wi-ﬁto a Server
Wi-ﬁis run in almost every electronic device. In this twenty-ﬁrst century, we can
connect almost anything through Internet of Things. Data can be sent to a local
server, data can extracted from a remote server, data logging can be done,

and therefore, online visualization of data is possible. Therefore, these advantages
were used and Wi-ﬁmodule ESP8266 was chosen over other communication
modules such as Bluetooth, GSM, and Xbee. The ESP8266 ESP-01 is a low-cost
Wi-ﬁmodule with full TCP/IP stack and microcontroller capability. It uses IEEE
802.11 communication protocol. It works on 3.3 V and consists of two GPIO pins,
Rx and Tx, CH_PD, Reset, Power and ground Pin. ESP8266 can be conﬁgured to
send data in two versions i.e. Standalone version and other version being with
Arduino. The latter version was used and Wi-ﬁmodule’s Rx and Tx will be
connected to Tx and Rx of Arduino. The pulse sensor and temperature sensor were
connected to the Analog ports of Arduino. There are a number of ways to send data
to server. AT commands is the one of the ways, and this was used to transmit the
data. These commands were used for their simpliﬁed version of coding. The values
from pulse and temperature sensor are sent using AT commands using ThingSpeak.
ThingSpeak is an open source Internet of Things (IoT) stage that empowers you to
gather, store, investigate, imagine, and follow up on information from sensors or
actuators, for example, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Beagle Bone Black, and other
equipment. ThingSpeak empowers the production of sensor logging applications,
area following applications, and social networking with status updates.
A channel was created with two parameters i.e. Temperature and pulse rate
sensor. Using the Wi-ﬁmodule, data was sent to the website using a unique API
key. The values on ThingSpeak are updated every 15 s.
Therefore, uploading on a webpage will help not only the patient but also the
remote doctors to assess or monitor the patient’s health. Doctors can anytime login
to their account and go to the channel which is made unique to each patient. This
lowers the overall Medicare cost (Fig. 6).

Results and Discussion
The Fig. 7 displays the temperature using Processing software. The temperature is
measured using LM35 sensor. Low-yield impedance, direct yield, and exact interior
adjustment of the LM35 sensor make it less demanding to interface.

The above Fig. 8 shows the output of the pulse sensor. The pulse sensor is quite
accurate to get the raw values. The raw values are converted to beats per minute
using an Arduino algorithm and displayed using Processing software. The
Processing software is therefore best suited for testing purposes.
The Fig. 9 displays the ﬁltered heartbeat connected to the serial monitor of
Arduino. Using serial plotter in Arduino, we are able to get the heartbeat display.
Though some noise has been eliminated, while getting the output through Arduino
had some delay while displaying its output. This can be reduced by using a more
efﬁcient data acquisition system than the Arduino and therefore get more sponta-
neous result (Fig. 10).

The above ﬁgure shows the output of the pulse sensor and temperature sensor
data on ThingSpeak. Through ESP8266 Wi-ﬁmodule, the data is transmitted
through AT commands. In the algorithm, there is an option for deﬁning the refresh
rate for sending the data to the server which the user can change it accordingly.

Conclusion
In this paper, new cheaper ways of obtaining medicare results such as ECG signal,
beats per minute and the patient’s temperature have been implemented. Using
Processing software, displaying the values is easier. Also, using remote server tools
such as ThingSpeak is used which allows storing and analyzing of data in a much
easier way. This all corresponds to the main objective of making low-cost medicare
system. However, there is no limit to the evolution of technology in any ﬁeld. This
project can further be taken to new heights such as sending email or message to the
doctor in case of emergency. Also, doctors far away from the testing location can
also feed the inputs to improve the patient’s health.

Modelling of UPFC (Uniﬁed Power Flow
Control) to Improve Stability of Power
System by Real and Reactive Power
Control of Transmission Line
Rakhi Kumari, Prerna and Chitrangada Roy
Abstract Power systems are very complicated, and it needs careful fabrication of
recent equipment considering the already existing devices. Flexible AC transmis-
sion system (FACTS) devices are introduced to improve the controllability and to
raise the power transfer capacity of electric power systems. In this paper, uniﬁed
power ﬂow controller (UPFC) is opted among various FACTS devices to improve
real and reactive power ﬂow in the transmission line. When UPFC is not connected
to the system, real and reactive power through transmission line cannot be con-
trolled. In this paper, a UPFC model has been designed and implemented using
MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results obtained from the model show the
improvement of power quality and voltage stability in transmission line.

Introduction

essential to improve the power transfer capacity of the current transmission systems.
FACTS devices are used in order to make the system fast and ﬂexible and to
increase the controlling capability. FACTS technology is basically a collection of
controllers which works individually or collectively with other devices to achieve
better system performance [2].
Among various FACTS devices, UPFC has been used due to its various
advantages over other FACTS device. It consists of shunt compensator as Static
Synchronous Compensator (i.e. STATCOM) and series compensator as Static
Synchronous Series Compensator (i.e. SSSC). These two converters are connected
one after another with the help of a DC link. It can simultaneously or selectively
control all the parameters such as voltage, phase angle, and impedance, which
affects ﬂow of power through the transmission. UPFC inserts voltage in the
transmission line; thus, it controls the ﬂow of real and reactive power through
transmission line independently [3]. Voltage regulation and transient stability of
power system are improved with the help of UPFC. In order to suppress oscillations
of power system, UPFC effectively controls damping [4].
In this paper, the capability of UPFC on controlling real and reactive power ﬂow
in transmission line to improve stability of the power system is investigated. The
simulation results are obtained using MATLAB/Simulink software to analyse the
capability of UPFC.
2
Operating Principle of UPFC
Uniﬁed power ﬂow controller is a speculated synchronous voltage source (SVC). It
is expressed at the fundamental frequency by voltage phasor (V) with adjustable
magnitude (0  V  Vmax) and angle a (0  a  2p). The UPFC consists of
two voltage source inverters VSC1 and VSC2 as shown in Fig. 1. These converters
are connected back-to-back through a capacitor.

UPFC connected to
transmission line

Rakhi Kumari et al.

The VSC2 injects a voltage to the transmission line through a coupling trans-
former, which is connected in series with the transmission line as shown in Fig. 1.
The transmission line current I travels through this voltage source to provide real
and reactive power interchange between UPFC and the transmission system. The
VSC1 consumes or delivers active power as per the requirement of VSC2 at the DC
link. The output voltage of VSC1 is delivered to the transmission line through a
coupling transformer which is connected in parallel with the transmission line.

The model of series converter using MATLAB/Simulink is shown in Fig. 2. In
series converter, we generate the pulses with the help of Space Vector Pulse Width
Modulation (SVPWM) technique [5], and these generated pulses are used to drive
the voltage source series converter.
The blocks represent the shunt converter using MATLAB/Simulink as shown in
Fig. 3. In case of shunt converter, pulses are generated with the help of Hysteresis

the voltage source converter.

Test System Modelling
The three-phase test system has been shown in Fig. 4. The generation voltage is
66 kV at 50 Hz. The length of three-phase 500 kV pi-section line is 60 km. In the
receiving end, a RL load of 100 MW at 0.8 power factor lagging is connected.

Results and Discussion
In this thesis, active and reactive power control for a UPFC has been discussed. The
principle control approach is such that the shunt controller of a UPFC controls the
bus voltage and DC link capacitor voltage. The series controller of UPFC regulates
the active and reactive power transfer of transmission line. The contribution to the
work has been encapsulated as follows.
Figures 5 and 6 show the sending end rms voltage and receiving end rms voltage
without UPFC. Sending end rms voltage is 352 kV and receiving end voltage is
347 kV. There is a difference in voltage between sending and receiving end rms
voltage due to the losses in the transmission line.
Figures 7 and 8 show the improved sending end rms voltage and receiving end
rms voltage in the presence of UPFC. Sending end rms voltage is slightly increased
to 352.3 kV, and receiving end voltage is increased to 350 kV. It is observed here
that the voltage regulation is improved when UPFC is installed in the transmission
line.
Figure 9 shows the active power through the line without UPFC. Here, active
power at the sending side is 28.11 MW and receiving end active power is

26.68 MW. When the transmission line is without UPFC, the real and reactive
power ﬂow cannot be regulated.
Figure 10 shows the active power ﬂow through line in the presence of UPFC.
Here, real power at the sending end side is increased to 95.7 MW (with UPFC)
from 28.11 MW (without UPFC) and receiving end active power is improved to
88.5 MW (with UPFC) from 26.68 MW (without UPFC). It is observed that the
transmission capacity of the existing transmission line is highly upgraded with the
help of UPFC controller.
In the presence of UPFC, the difference between the sending end real power and
receiving end real power is high in the transmission line. As a result of increased
transmission line losses, it counts losses in the both converters.
654
Rakhi Kumari et al.

The waveform for reactive power at sending and receiving ends without UPFC is
shown in Fig. 11; in this case, sending end reactive power (45 MVAR) is greater
than the receiving end reactive power (44.44 MVAR). When the transmission line
is connected with the UPFC as shown in Fig. 12, the reactive power of receiving
end is increased to 73.4 MVAR and the reactive power of sending end is increased
to 65 MVAR. So here, it is observed that power quality of the transmission line gets
improved in the presence of UPFC.
6
Conclusion
This paper clearly shows that UPFC used in this case has improved the real and
reactive power ﬂow and voltage stability in transmission line. The simulation
results show that real power and reactive power at both sides, i.e. at receiving end
and at sending end, are improved when UPFC is introduced in the transmission line.
Voltage regulation is also improved when UPFC is placed in the transmission line.
Thus, these results illustrate the performance of UPFC to improve stability of power
system effectively.

Autonomous Navigation Robot Based
on Real-Time Image Processing
Bijay Rai, Pratik Pradhan and Roshan Pradhan
Abstract The project discusses the design and operation of a simple robot vehicle
guided by the track and navigation system made capable by 2D image processing in
MATLAB software. The system uses a robust and simple design to automatically
track a robot toward a speciﬁed path. It does not use GPS or other position sensor
system to track vehicle along the path but rather uses visual information run by a
software program. The program takes real-time pictures of the vehicle, under-
standing its direction of projection, and guides to path set by the user. Its contri-
bution can be used for unmanned autodriving/autopiloting of a vehicle in a given
path through a monitoring camera or satellite imagery. Its implication consumes
least resources of technology as only the imagery monitor system and simple
control signal transmission apart from the complex dependency of resources of GPS
technology or multiplexed sensor systems. The only requirement being the visibility
of the robot from a static camera device, its approach is similar to the functionality
of navigation through biological visual based guidance system of humans, so it is a
direct, experienced, and simple robust approach.

Introduction
The project setup required a moving robot, USB Web camera 5MP and MATLAB
7.11 running on desktop having CPU 3.2 GHz Intel i3 processor. The robot was a
small DC motor-driven car capable of making left/right turns and forward move-
ment. It was controlled wirelessly through a RF transmitter 2.4 GHz connected to
the USB of the desktop. The robot car had the RF receiver and an 8-bit micro-
controller to decode instruction given by transmitter to drive the car into its directed
motion. The USB camera captures images of the robot and its surroundings on
which the user can set a predetermined path. The image frames were fed to the
program in MATLAB to process for information of the robot and its path. The
frames were then processed in real time to understand the position and alignment of
the robot comparatively with the path points to be followed. Image segmentation
and geometrical calculations are computed for understanding and directing the
position of the robot to its path. It generated the instruction of next movement to be
executed by the robot. The system is a really efﬁcient approach for automatic
navigation of robots rather than the widely used triangulation method through
complex machines such as radio towers and satellites [1]. GPS often is not perfect
for autonomous control on navigation as it does not give an accurate idea of
orientation of movement. It is assisted with other IMU (inertial measurement unit)
to improve accuracy of movement direction sensors [2]. Image processing tech-
nology is an inexpensive technique possible and suitable for autonavigation in plain
uniform terrain platform. The least resource requiring capability of the system can
be applied in industrial and military applications [3].

IMAGE Acquisition and Object Recognition
A single image of the robot and its coverage area was taken through the USB camera.
Image taken by camera was in HSV format which is an easier and better color
segmentation method for image processing the color component is very immune to
darkness and intensity level change [4]. First, the robot vehicle was to be marked with
a target coordinate, by the user to identify the color of the object. It was done by using
the mouse to click at the proximate midpoint of the robot in the picture. This needed
to be done only once for the initialization of the robot identiﬁcation. The hue (color)
and value (brightness) of the target coordinates hðxt; ytÞ; vðxt; ytÞ, respectively, are
taken and stored for reference of object later. The robot body was given a deﬁnite
shape and color so as to understand its position and alignment in the 2D plane. Here,
an isosceles triangle blue-colored object was placed on top of the car to serve the
purpose. It was then followed by user clicking path coordinate points to be covered
by the robot. The coordinates were stored as tðx1; y1Þ; tðx2; y2Þ; tðx3; y3Þ. . .tðxn; ynÞ
where n is the number of path points to be covered. Then, the program took con-
tinuous shot of the robot and its coverage area for automatic navigation through
658
B. Rai et al.

image processing as shown in Fig. 2. Frame size of the continuous shot was taken at a
low value as 150  150 pixels for fast efﬁcient processing as imposed less dimen-
sional matrix calculations. Segmentation of the image frame was carried out to create
objects of the color matching to that of the target coordinate. Normalized Hue color
and brightness value hðxi; yjÞ; vðxi; yjÞ of all coordinates (i.e., i, j = 1, 2, 3… 150)
were run in a loop and compared with hðxt; ytÞ; vðxt; ytÞ, respectively. By matching
the color region, the target body is segmented and created into regions. This is an
efﬁcient and easy process of segmentation for identiﬁcation and processing of the
objects [5]. All values lying within a threshold of 0.02 hue and 0.2 value are seg-
mented to form regional white image objects in black background. The saturation
threshold value was taken higher to consider the effects of different lighting intensity
effects. These objects are then applied with empty holes ﬁll-up and Gaussian ﬁlter.
This helps remove noises and black pixel gaps on the object created by irregular
surface of body or lighting condition on the robot [6]. Following was the code written
to recognize the object color using hue and saturation value limitation.
bw1 = hsv1(:,:,1)<(hue+hue_thres) & hsv1(:,:,1)>(hue-hue_thres) &
hsv1(:,:,2)>(sat-sat_thres) & hsv1(:,:,2)<(sat+sat_thres);
bw2 = imﬁll(bw1, ‘holes’);
h = fspecial(‘gaussian’,[2 2],8);
bw = imﬁlter(bw2,h);
Gaussian ﬁlter formula is applied as
gði; jÞ ¼ c:e
i2 þ j2
2r2
where r is deﬁned by the user, and i, j are pixel coordinates controlled by the
m-, n-dimensional matrix set by the user.
The object closest to the reference coordinate was taken as the robot object hence
recognizing the robot and its position. The centroid of the object ðxc; ycÞ was
considered as the position of the robot in the 2D plane. It may be obvious that
similar blue-colored objects may be lying around the robot. But they are neglected
as the blue-colored object only to the nearest of the target coordinate tðxk; ykÞ is
considered. This is possible taking into consideration that the object lays distinc-
tively close to the targeted body.
This closest reference point for progressive frame was considered as centroid
ðxc; ycÞ of the chosen object of robot in previous frame. There is a small time gap
between each frame of around 100–200 ms so having a highest probability that the
centroid of robot object in past frame will be closest to centroid of same object in
next frame. This also makes identiﬁcation of the robot immune, as program has a
least chance that other similar objects in surroundings are misidentiﬁed as robot
object under guidance. The head and centroid method is superior for orientation
calculation of moving objects which is mostly impossible simple GPS-based sys-
tems. GPS often requires progressive reading of movement coordinates to under-
stand the orientation of movement of a body [7].

Geometrical Measurements and Calculations
The crucial step in processing of every frame of the image becomes to understand
the shape and movement projection of the object robot. A robot could be under-
stood of its position and movement trajectory from the image frames processed with
geometrical computation at high speeds [8]. Shape of the robot is designed as
blue-colored isosceles triangle, making it asymmetrical between the upper and
lower parts of the triangle. This helps in unique recognition of the tail and the head
of the object. Distances from the centroid of triangle object to the extreme points of
the objects are measured. The vertex in the furthermost distance (tip point of the
triangle) is taken as the head of the object, while the centroid is taken as the bottom
end of the object as shown in Fig. 1. This helps in clearly understanding the
alignment of the robot in a 2D plane hence giving information of its movement
projection angle on the plane. Angle in between head point coordinate ðxh; yhÞ, the
tail point coordinate ðxc; ycÞ, and the horizontal axis passing through the tail point
was measured to be taken as car angle a using formula

Methodology Used for Movement of Robot
When car and path angles are almost equal to each other within a threshold angle,
gthres (set by user) the car was moved forward. In the case, gj j\gthres, the robot has
to rotate left or right as explained by the ﬂowchart in Figs. 4 and 5 given.

All angles were measured with the bottom edge of the ﬁgure as x-axis and left
edge of the ﬁgure as y-axis. This way the car reaches to the target coordinate
tðx1; y1Þ. The reach to the point was decided by measuring distance between cen-
troid ðxc; ycÞ of robot object and the next target point coordinate represented as d,

When dj j\dthres, the program automatically updates and guides the robot to the

Any misalignment of the robot on its progression is corrected by the same method
until dj j\dthres. The process is carried out until the count for all the desired
coordinates was reached. The detailed ﬂow of processing is described as given by
the ﬂowchart in Figs. 4 and 5.

Observations on Performance
The project had been trialed with several different types of settings for different
results of performance. The threshold angle and the speed of the robot played
critical important role in performance. Figure 6 displays the plots and images for

output observations in real time. It plotted the track of the vehicle movement in real
time, measuring the distance covered by the robot and total time taken to complete
the desired track. The angle difference of path and car angles was also plotted in
real-time graph. The robot could be set to different speeds of operation during
forward movement (f-spd) and rotation (t-spd). Three settings of speed possible are
low speed-3, medium speed-4, and high speed-5. µ was set to various values to
judge the performance.
Tests were operated at various conditions of paths and various speed settings of
robot. The rotation turn speed and forward run speed were set at different speeds as
required by the task. The MATLAB program with its multiple ﬁgures/plots/images
and real-time capture and process tasks could only give frame speed around 3–4
frames per second. However, a reliable performance at low frame rate indicates that
the system would certainly perform at higher frame rates with better hardware GPU
and software like Open CV [9].
The distance covered by the vehicle is calculated in number of pixels. Total time
taken by the robot is calculated in seconds, hence also giving the average speed of
travel by the robot at pixels/s. High value of the distance error indicated the quantity
of how much the robot had moved out of the desired path. The robot was tried
under different shapes of path, i.e., zigzag, quadrilateral, and low-curved paths. The
most difﬁcult and time-taking path for robot remained the zigzag path as it had too
large shift in path angle. The medium value of gthres ¼ 20 gave the best perfor-
mance causing least oscillation of angle difference for the robot. Making the angle
low produced too many oscillations on the path, high value of µ = 25 caused the
robot to move much out of the desired path causing elongated for more distance
error. Setting low threshold angle is always better for perfect trajectory control of
the vehicle on path but requires higher frame rate computing software and hard-
ware. In all of the cases, the turning speed is always taken lesser than the forward
speed as turning requires proper alignment of the robot to the path; however, the
forward speed is an after process from when the path is already found. Test results
are shown in Fig. 6 for different path and speed settings.
In Test 4, the both turning and forward were kept on the higher level. We saw
the distance error increased but, however, did bring improvement in the speed of the
vehicle.
In Test 5, we decreased the turning speed and increased the forward speed which
further increased overall speed of the robot but caused signiﬁcant distance error.

Tests 6–9 were based on quadrilateral path with corner turn point on the path.
With same speed as in Test 5, the distance error increased most abruptly, causing
the most inaccurate movements and time-consuming execution. Decreased forward
speed in Test 7 produced much higher performance with least error and highest
speed in quadrilateral path. Decreasing threshold angle in Test 8 has little change of
effect on the performance. Increasing threshold angle in Test 9, however, reduces
the performance to least, with lowest speed of all tests.
The last set of test was operated on low-curved almost straight paths. These
paths gave best performances at low threshold angles and medium forward speed
setting as shown on Tests 10 and 11.
Increasing the speed of the robot to the next level decreased performance as
observed in Test 12.
It can therefore be concluded that system operates differently on different con-
ditions. Zigzag path result gave best on medium gthres ¼ 20, performing at the
higher average speed on high-level speed settings t-spd = 4, f-spd = 5 but with
some loss in accuracy of path. It, however, gave a better accurate and faster per-
formance at same threshold angle with speed t-spd = 3, f-spd = 4. Observation
table of all experiments result is given in Table 1. Supporting graph of error and
vehicle average speed is given in Figs. 7 and 8.
For quadrilateral type, path least distance error was possible with low
gthres ¼ 1520. The result was best and accurate at gthres ¼ 20 and speed setting
t-spd = 3, f-spd = 4. Decreasing the angle caused oscillations, hence taking more
time to reach destination and decreasing the speed of the car.
Less curve path was covered without much problem at low angle settings. It
gave the best performance against distance error and for high-speed movement of
vehicle.
Therefore, the test results can be tabulated as follows.

Conclusion
The successful execution of experiment on robot navigation system implies is an
economical and reliable system and easy approach. It performs well in low frames
for low-speed robot operations, hence promising of performance in high frame rate
with better software and hardware integration. The project used MATLAB soft-
ware, which has issues regarding memory access and management during real-time
video processing. Higher frame rates could be achieved using more speciﬁc soft-
ware like open CV. Such image processing technique can also be used in closed
circuit industrial application for automatic navigation of free robots. It can even be
applied for routing of machine tools in CNC machines, medical surgical operation,
and UAV guidance system. It can be integrated with artiﬁcial algorithm to
understand and be adaptive to complex new situations and detections of movements
and its operation. The project can be further improved with better object

more advanced tools and sensors for it to work in real scenarios for the idea of

The Performance Enhancement
of Statistically Signiﬁcant Bicluster
Using Analysis of Variance
K. Vengatesan, S.B. Mahajan, P. Sanjeevikumar and Sana Moin
Abstract In this article, the performance enhancement of statistically signiﬁcant
bicluster using analysis of variance is articulated. Various statistical methods are
used to analyze the gene expression level. It is found that analysis of variance is one
of the efﬁcient methods for aggregation between a pair of genes. It computes the
values by comparing the mean value of each group, and results are tested using the
hypothesis to calculate the p-value. Various tests are conducted to increase
the performance of the gene pair. Various clustering techniques are functional to
investigate the gene expression information for both homogeneous and heteroge-
neous. Statistical approaches are used to identify the relevant information from the
subset of genes. Various testing methods were conducted to enhance the perfor-
mance of correlated genes. When compared with the biclustering methods such as
the paired t-test, two-sample tests, the ANOVAs One sample test produces better
result.

Introduction
Clustering is a group of objects which are similar to one another, that can be
separated by a region or by a surface, with different geometrical objects such as
circle, rectangle, and triangle. Figure 1 shows that green and red color data points
which are generated from different distributions such as probability distribution,
binomial, Poisson, normal, and uniform distributions [1]. The gene expression or
samples are represented in a row and column of a gene expression matrix. The
clustering may be applied to gene or experimental conditions to form the required
group [2, 3]. Identifying the group of possible co-regulated gene from the sequence
of data are used in various mathematical techniques to identify the correlation
between the pair of gene such as scatter or dot diagram, Karl Pearson’s coefﬁcient
correlation, Spearman rank correlation, two-way frequency, and concurrent devi-
ation method [4]. The statistical test is used to check whether samples are grouped
supervised or unsupervised approach [5]. Generally, the cluster investigation
depends upon on cluster algorithm and distance measure, from which distance
measure is quantiﬁcation of similarity or dissimilarity between the two objects and
cluster algorithms procedure to group the objects within small cluster distance [6,
7]. In general for the distance measures, a variety of geometric formula are used to
estimate the match of the pair of gene dataset such as average intercluster distance,
average intracluster distance, centroid Manhattan distance, centroid Euclidean
distance, ratio of merging two clusters, and intercluster distance [8].

Biclustering
A biclustering is a subset of gene, which is derived from various experimental
conditions and discovers a desired pattern [9]. There are several existing methods to
ﬁnd signiﬁcant bicluster in huge expression data. The classic clustering methods
like K-mean, hierarchical clustering, self-organizing maps are pertinent when the
genes are with the similar behaviors and in the same cluster over all conditions.
Fig. 1 Similarity group

K. Vengatesan et al.

For example, in a cellular process, the set of gene is energetic barely in a certain
split of environment or obscure in numerous pathways that either active or co-active
under a subset of circumstances [10]. The classic clustering method could not be
used to ﬁnd the signiﬁcant relevant group of gene in different experimental con-
ditions, so the biclustering method is an efﬁcient method for ﬁnding the relevant
group of gene in different experimental conditions. The linear transformation of
aggregation
between
different
expression
levels
is
measured
by
using
a
pattern-based model which is mainly used for positive correlated genes. When gene
correlation is negative pattern, the existing work is then not applicable either
tendency-based algorithm or pattern-based model.
Figure 2 represents four genes (g1, g2, g3, and g4) under various experimental
conditions, from which g1 and g3 have similar characters and g2 and g4 are another
set of genes that have analogous characters and consider various microarray of
dataset for experimental purpose to form the clusters [11]. Bicluster is a uniform
submatrix, uses the algorithm called greedy, in which every stage the best optimal
value is chosen from the list of feasible solutions. The novel-based approach used in
biclustering combines statistical consideration and graph theoretic to ﬁnd similar
expression pattern over a subset of conditions, and the gene is signiﬁcantly changed
based on the subset of values [12]. The observed bicluster is calculated using
probability functions, which calculates tight upper bound value. The weighting
schemes are used to ﬁnd the signiﬁcant bicluster in expression data and form
bipartite graph. The drawback of the system is computationally hard and need
degree restriction on the graph. It also limits the gene vertices degree and edges a
ﬁxed constant value C. The gene participation for weighted problem uses poly-
nomial algorithm and maximum edge biclique, which are NP-complete problem.
There are different patterns of biclusters available such as constant-value bicluster, a
ﬁxed-row bicluster, a ﬁxed-column bicluster, successive addition of bicluster, and
successive product of bicluster. Patterns of bicluster are depicted in Tables 1, 2, 3,
4, and 5. In a successive product of bicluster, set of rows and columns can be
calculated by multiplying one column or row through a static assessment [8]. In a

each horizontal or vertical by adding some constant rate. A perfect bicluster with
successive addition mode can be denoted by BI,J that can be written as
BI;J; ¼ l þ Gr þ Gc; for all iɛI, jɛJ, µ is a static value, Gr is the row value, and Gc is
the column value. Similarly, a ﬁxed row and ﬁxed column of biclusters can be
expressed as follows BI;J ¼ l þ Gr for all iɛI, jɛJ; BI;J ¼ l þ Gc for all iɛI, jɛJ,
where µ is a constant value, Gr is gene row, and Gc is a column in the subset of
values [11, 13]. A constant-value bicluster consists of constant value for each row
and column in the expression matrix. A perfect constant bicluster can be written as
BI,J = µ.

the correlation between each pair of genes is calculated by using correlation
methods, in which each session output will be followed by the next part of the
algorithm. BICAT tool is used for analysis the different existing algorithms for six
sample genes [9], and the statistical process of six different gene analysis is pro-
vided in Table 6.
Figure 4 shows the number of algorithms of different data value. These data
values have been extracted from the different gene datasets, i.e., from G1 to G6
[14]. It clearly states that there has been signiﬁcant increase in the particular
algorithm while there is a slight growth in other data values. One-way analysis of
variation has been injected with these algorithms to analyze the variation in the
graph. As a result, the hypotheses have clearly described that the cluster K-mean
and clustering HCL made a huge difference when comparing to previous existing

bicluster CC, and bicluster ISA are slightly growing in respective manner. Separate
graph has been added for algorithm such as bicluster K-mean, bicluster HCL,
bicluster OPSM, bicluster ISA, bicluster CC, and bicluster Bimax [8]. The corre-
lation between the two variables X and Y has calculated by using Karl Pearson’s
mathematical formula that measuring the magnitude of the linear correlation
coefﬁcient between pair of variables. If X and Y are two variables, the correlation
coefﬁcient q(X, Y) between them is written as

Table 7 is sample microarray data consider for processing. Table 6 gives a detail
about statistical processing of gene from Table 7. Comparing the gene pair G1 &
G2, the correlation coefﬁcient is 0.53, mean value is 96.25, covariance is 371.09,
and a standard deviation value is 40.32; for each pair of sample, different types of
test are applied to measure the performance such as two-sample t-test value is
−1.79, paired t-test value is −2.08 and ANOVA One way value is 3.19, when the
same test is to be applied for another pair of gene G1 & G3, the values are 0.64,
0.68, and 0.41. When compared G1 & G2, the ANOVA One way gives less value.
But the overall statistical calculation shows that ANOVA One Way methods pro-
duce best result when compared to other methods.
In Table 8, the statistical expression of gene has been measured. It compares
every gene to each other to ﬁnd the variations. For example, comparison between
genes pairs G1 and G2 to G6 results signiﬁcant value for extracting datasets. Many
analytical methods are being tested (e.g. standard deviation, covariance, mean, and

correlation coefﬁcient are the basic methods in valuating gene expression). In this
process, ANOVA (generally analysis of variation) has been used to ﬁnd a reliable
gene expression by comparing gene datasets. Hence ANOVA has been considered
as the best approach for gene expression and uses several tools to view the result as
hypotheses that need to be validated.

Conclusion
The performance enhancement of statistically signiﬁcant bicluster using analysis of
variance is presented. There are several clustering methods available to group the
pair of genes, based on the similarity, the clustering can be applicable for different
areas, of these gene cluster is a popular one, in which different ideas are followed to
group pair of genes, it is NP Hard problem, different clustering methods for dif-
ferent problems. A microarray consists of the thousands of gene expression level
and process the high number of genes, the ANOVA one way model is more suitable
and produces effective result when compared to other testing methods such as
two-sample t-test, paired t-test. Also the various common parameters are considered
such as mean, covariance, standard deviation for each pair of genes, and various
algorithms are tested by using bicluster analysis tool. Considering the pair of gene
G1 & G6, the two-sample t-test produces 3.72 related with each other, the paired t-
test produces 2.71 each other, and ANOVA one way produced 13.81 statistical
results. It clearly shows that the analysis of variance with one sample test produces
best result for huge amount of gene expression data.

Multimodal Classiﬁcation of Arrhythmia
and Ischemia Using QRS-ST Analysis
Akash Kumar Bhoi, Karma Sonam Sherpa and Bidita Khandelwal
Abstract Probabilistic classiﬁcation approaches have been presented for arrhyth-
mic and ischemic data using QRS-ST evaluation. The proposed methodology is
segregated into two major parts, i.e., (a) detection of QRS complex and ST seg-
ments by improvised Pan-Tompkins and difference operation method, respectively,
and (b) classiﬁcation of healthy, arrhythmic, and ischemic classes using linear
discriminant analysis (LDA), decision tree (DT), and artiﬁcial neural network
(ANN), respectively. Two correlative classiﬁcation features (frequency and time
domain) of QRS-ST, i.e., (1) ratio of power spectrum (PS) and power spectral
density (PSD) and (2) area under the curve (AUC), are introduced to these clas-
siﬁers. The algorithm is evaluated and validated with standard databases such as
FANTASIA (healthy), MIT-BIH Arrhythmia (arrhythmic), and long-term ST
database (ischemic), respectively. For uniform probability classiﬁcation, ECG
episodes with 100% sensitivity (Se) and the speciﬁcity (Sp) are included in this
analytical modeling. As the experimentation is performed to validate the possibility
of these features for classiﬁcation, the percentage of classiﬁcation certainly could be
improved by considering other vital features. We conclude that correlative analysis
of QRS-ST may be evoked as signiﬁcant marker for arrhythmia and ischemia.

Introduction
Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is responsible for increasing the oxygen demand in
heart muscle and also results in possible myocardial infarction [1]. Myocardial
ischemia is responsible for morphological changes in ST-T wave. This will lead to
bundle branch blocks and prolongation of QRS complex [2]. In addition to QRS
slope particulars, the conventional ST segment analysis is an efﬁcient method to
monitor myocardial ischemia [3]. Various methods have been proposed, and with
recent studies, it is found that (150–250 Hz) high-frequency content of the QRS
complex is a better identiﬁcation tool for ischemia than the traditional ST analysis
[4–6]. Candil et al. discussed in their article that cute and transient myocardial
ischemia detection may be initiated with QT interval analysis [7]. Xu et al. have
presented an algorithm for QRS complex detection using slope vector waveform
(SVW), and also, this method performed very well in case of noisy signals [8].
Arzeno et al. proposed a unique technique for discriminating various classes of
ECG anomalies by comparing detection techniques for QRS complex and delin-
eating its failure instances [9]. Li et al. have proposed the wavelet transform
(WT) with multiscale features; among P and T waves, noise, and baseline drift, the
QRS complex is distinguished properly [10]. There are several special digital ﬁlters
(e.g., Hilbert transform, ANN, nonlinear high-pass ﬁlter, neural networks, wavelet
transform, ﬁlter banks, and geometrical matching approach) which were imple-
mented for detection, analysis, and classiﬁcation of ECG signal both in time or in
frequency domain [11–17]. Slimane et al. have presented an algorithm for QRS
complex detection using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) which is integrated
with high-pass ﬁlter, nonlinear transform, integration, and low-pass ﬁlter [18]. The
performance is found to be better than “Christov’s” detection method [19]. Romero
et al. concluded that the evaluation of depolarization changes during ischemia could
be analyzed robustly by QRS slopes [20]. Karimipour et al. have implemented a
real-time P-QRS-T wave’s detection algorithm using discrete wavelet transform
(DWT), derivative (ﬁrst-order), and adaptive thresholding techniques [21]. Other
traditional methods developed before 1990, the Pan-Tompkins algorithm, has been
the most efﬁcient method for QRS complex detection (real-time) [22].
Yeh et al. proposed a computational free QRS complex detection method termed
as the difference operation method (DOM) [23]. Here, this approached has been
modiﬁed for T onset detection, whereas Pan–Tompkins method (PT method) was
adopted for QRS detection. So the improvised combination of PT method and
DOM segmented and localized the QRS complex and ST segments, respectively.
The classiﬁcation work has been performed with the extracted features from the
mean of QRS-ST.

ECG Databases
The healthy, arrhythmic, and ischemic ECG signals are selected from three different
databases, i.e., FANTASIA [24], MIT-BIH Arrhythmia [25], and long-term ST
[26], respectively. All the ECG signals are with duration of 1 h which is selected
from the 24 h recorded data. The 1 h recording from each episode (out of 24 h
recorded data) is selected in such a way that the false-negative (FN) and
false-positive (FP) beats are found to be 0 after detection of QRS complex and ST
segment by improvised PT method and DOM, respectively. 36 recordings from
each databases (i.e., total 108 ECG recordings) are selected which are satisfying
100% accuracy in QRS complex and ST segment detection.
3
QRS-ST Detection Methodologies
“The desirable passband to maximize the QRS energy is approximately 5–15 Hz
[27, 28].’’ Cascaded low-pass and high-pass ﬁlters are implemented to decrease the
noise produced by muscle, 60 Hz power-line interference, baseline drift, and T wave
interference and also achieved a 3 dB passband using 5–12 Hz. After ﬁltering, the
QRS complex detection procedure is followed by derivative ﬁlter, squaring function,
moving-window integration, thresholding, and adjusting RR interval Fig. 1. The
difference equation operation is implemented to detect the Tmax points, and the ST
segment (i.e., S or J points and Tonset) is localized with search interval operation.
The QRS complex detection operation is basically PAN-TOMPKINS method [29,
30], and the improvisation of difference operation method (DOM) is implemented
for QRS Complex detection (Fig. 2).
3.1
Difference Equation Operation (Tmax Detection)
The Pan–Tompkins’ algorithm precisely detected the QRS complex and localized
the Q; R and S or J point s in Fig. 3. Difference equation operation and search
interval operation were performed after S or J point for the detection of Tonset.

where yST ¼ Input ECG signal T1 ¼ 2MVp, and T2 ¼ 2MVn.
MVp = mean values of all positive waveform amplitudes, and MVn =
mean values of all negative waveform amplitudes.
Step 3:
The signal ^yST is then dissected into positive part ^y þ
ST and negative ^y
ST part,
respectively.
Step 4:
Search operation is performed to ﬁnd out the extreme value points for each
interval of 200 samples from S point toward the direction of T wave.
Nonzero extreme value in an interval of ^y þ
ST and ^y
ST are stored, and other
values are discarded.
Step 5:
This follows two substeps for selecting the correct extreme values.
Step 5:1:
The time difference between ^y þ
ST and ^y
ST of two adjacent
nonzero positive extreme values is measured.
Condition 1: The larger positive most extreme value is con-
sidered when time difference is  interval duration.
Condition 2: Both positive extreme values are stored when
time difference is > interval duration.
Step 5:2:
Time difference between ^y þ
ST and ^y
ST of the two adjacent
selected most extreme values are measured.
Condition 1: The selected two most extreme values are chosen
as the correct pair when time difference is  interval duration.
Condition 2: The chosen correct pair needs to be deleted (don’t
represent the actual pair), when the time difference is ˃ interval
duration.
Step 6:
Check whether two consecutive selected peaks are within the threshold
duration. If not, delete it.
Step 7:
If the locations of these extreme points are matched to the input ECG
signal, then the maximum positive value of the interval is Tmax point, as
shown in Fig. 4.

Search Interval Operation (Tonset Detection)
Step 13:
Search interval-1 is deﬁned which locates 20 sampling points before Tmax
point. The minimum value before Tmax point is marked as point T1.
Step 14:
Search interval-2 is deﬁned such that 40 sampling points before Tmax
point. The least point before Tmax is T2.
Step 15:
Check the location and amplitude of T1 and T2 to conﬁrm the location of
Tonset. If their position is different and amplitude of T1 is greater than T2,
then the position of T1 is the position of Tonset or vice versa.

are found to be 100% for the selected 108 recordings of three standard databases.
The MITDB data #105, #108, #203, #222 are not included due to higher detection
failure rate. Further, the features are extracted from the segmented mean QRS
complexes and mean ST segments of 1-h recorded ECG signals.

The mean QRS complexes and mean ST segments are accumulated from all the
detected QRS-ST segments, and the following features are also extracted from these
mean QRS-ST segments for further classiﬁcation parameters.

Feed-Forward Neural Networks
Figure 10 shows a two-layer feed-forward network. There are four feature inputs
(i.e., RatioPS&PSD and AUC of QRS-ST) for classiﬁcation, as shown in Figs. 11 and
12. “This ﬁrst layer of functional nodes is sometimes referred to as a hidden layer,
since we are not supposed to inspect or control the output values on these nodes
during the process of setting the network weights, that is, during training or
learning.” The outputs of the 10 hidden layers are subsequently processed by an
output layer which is used to read out the category in which the input pattern is
placed.

Discussion
The proposed model is correlatively analyzed and classiﬁed using QRS-ST features;
this further may be a marker for arrhythmogenic ventricular myocardial ischemia.
We have already implemented an approach for analyzing classiﬁcation probability
for myocardial ischemia and cardiac arrhythmias using the frequency domain
features [32]. The QRS-ST detection and classiﬁcation algorithms are implemented
and evaluated in MATLAB R2013a platform. ST segment detection by improvised
DOM is implemented because it is easy to perform and computational free
approach. Yeha et al. proposed method, DOM, has only 0.19% failure rate in
MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database, which is signiﬁcantly a better result as compared to
earlier popular methods [23]. The Pan–Tompkins has also high accuracy of 99.3%
in QRS complex detection [30]. But in this scenario, the focus is more on the
probability classiﬁcations for the possible features, so the selected ECG signals
from all the databases have 100% accuracy in inﬂection point detection.
Implementing LDA classiﬁer, the calculated resubstitution error is 37.96% and
misclassiﬁcation
error
of
QDA
is
30.56%
across
QRS RatioPS&PSD
and
ST RatioPS&PSD. In case of decision tree, it is of only 7.41%. Resubstitution error of
LDA across QRS AUC and ST AUC found to be 29.63%, whereas in case of
decision tree, it is of 10.19%. Considering the same features, the classiﬁcation work
has been performed using ANN, and for arrhythmia and healthy, the result found to
be 87.5% with 12.5% misclassiﬁcation. In case of ischemia and healthy, the ANN
classiﬁers show improvement in result with 91.7% accurate classiﬁcation and 8.3%
misclassiﬁcation.

Conclusion
The important information related to onset of arrhythmia and ischemia can be
studied statistically by analyzing the morphological changes in QRS complex and
ST segments. The automated detection and analysis techniques help in improvising
these ﬁndings. The proposed approach precisely detects the inﬂection points of
QRS-ST and also explores the possibility of classiﬁcation of ischemia and
arrhythmia. This study also foregrounds on the salient features of QRS-ST corre-
lation subjected to cardiovascular abnormality classiﬁcation. Further comprehen-
sive research involves with larger subjects for better feasibility of the applied
techniques.

(Multilayer Perceptron) Technique:
A Review
Rijhi Dey, Ardhendu Ghoshal and Bipan Tudu
Abstract In recent years, there has been extensive interest in the revelation of
different technologies for artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) application in various
classiﬁcation of biomedical signals. Several publications have focused on diverse
applications of ANN techniques for biomedical signals classiﬁcation, detection, and
processing. This review work gives an overview on the multilayer perceptron
(MLP) technique of ANN and how this technology is useful for the classiﬁcation of
EMG signal. This paper will be interesting for those researchers who are studying
the classiﬁcation EMG signal for tremor detection in Parkinson’s disease. Many
researchers have worked and also working on Parkinson’s disease tremor by using
EMG signal and classifying its feature using ANN. Among those various tech-
niques, MLP technique is highlighted in this work for the classiﬁcation of EMG
signal. The core center of this paper is to review the evolution and research works
related to the topic mentioned above.

Introduction
Biomedical signal is a term which is derived from a combined electrical signal
extracted from any biological structure that portraits a physical variable of infor-
mation [1]. These signals are generally taken as a function of time which is
described in terms of its amplitude, frequency, and phase [2].
Among those biomedical signals, the electromyogram (EMG) is a signal that
evaluates the electrical current generated in muscles during contraction which
represents the neuromuscular activities [3]. EMG signals are regarded as most
convenient as electrophysiological signals in both medical and engineering ﬁelds.
Electromyography is mainly an examination which is done to record the electrical
activities of muscles. It helps to detect various diseases and conditions muscles,
including muscular dystrophy, pinched nerves, and myasthenia gravis. [4].
The technology, for recording the information from EMG signal, is relatively
new [1]. There were few limitations in the processing of nonlinearity in the surface
electromyography [5]. Recent studies and progress in technologies have made it
possible for the development for advanced EMG detection and analysis techniques.
In recent studies, neural network has become one of the effective methods to
analyze and categorize the biomedical signals, due to its good capability, adapt-
ability, and nonlinearity in its network [6]. The ANN technique is most acceptable
for nonlinear data modeling and can cover divergence among different conditions
[7]. The essential conditions for designing an ANN for a given application include:
(i)
To determine the system construction
(ii)
To deﬁne the actual number of layers, the number of hidden units in the
middle layers, and number of units in the input and output layers
(iii)
To have the training algorithm which is used during the learning phase [8].
Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been identiﬁed as the commonest neurodegener-
ative disease that gradually deteriorates the central nervous system [9]. As reported
by World Health Organization (WHO), it was evaluated that the world is having
seven to 10 million PD patients [10, 11]. With the prevailing and ongoing progress
development in microelectronics, it has expanded the interest in using computerized
methods for detecting early symptoms or tremor detection on more objective basis.
EMG signal analysis has been chosen as one of the technique for this reason.
MLP neural network, one of the commonly used ANN techniques, has been
applied in many examples of a similar nature [12–14]. In fact, it had also been
successfully developed as a test case to predict the tremor onset of PD [15]. The
major advantage of using MLP network is that the initial results showed that it can
act as an extremely effective predictor for the classiﬁcation of EMG signal.

Related Research Works
Pan et al. (2007) has worked with ANN to anticipate the onset of Parkinson’s
disease tremor on human body [15]. In their work, it was shown how ANN can
identify the pattern of the onset tremor from real-time recordings. Here, ANN was
used for pattern recognition of EMG signal. Among various types of ANN tech-
niques, MLP was chosen for this work due to its well-known properties. The MLP
network is a responsible training network. This network was prepared using back
propagation with the LFP signal that prevailed after sixty seconds, which provided
the tremor training data for the network. During their experiment, they found that
the total number of network inputs has an immense impact on the network training
presentation. The tuned neural network was able to indicate properly when the
tremor was taking place and also gave an indication when the tremor was likely to
happen. Moreover, it was clearly depicted that neural network was able to detect the
information correctly. Therefore, this work provided a better understanding of
Parkinson’s brain function.
In 2013, Gharehchopogh et al. studied the two techniques of ANN, MLP and
radial basis function (RBF), which were used effectively for the classiﬁcation of
EMG signal for the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease [16]. In this work, the
Parkinson’s disease dataset was obtained from UCI machine learning database. It
was observed from their study that MLP was one of the appropriate methods for the
classiﬁcation with 93.22% accuracy for the dataset.
According to their study, MLP technique is originally based on Rosenblatt’s
single perceptron [17]. But they had used conventional 3-layer MLP network to
classify the EMG signal. The MLP network which was used contained an input
layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. Overall, 22 input nodes, 5 hidden nodes,
and 1 output node were used. The inclusive computation of the MLP network was
given by Eq. (1):
y ¼ g
X
m
j¼1
w2
j g
X
d
i¼1
w2
ijxi þ b1
j
 
!
þ b2
 
!
ð1Þ
Therefore, in their case study, the result was presented for d = 22 and m = 5. All
the 22 input neurons used were totally connected to the hidden layer. The single
output neuron was fully connected with the 5 hidden neurons, each one being
evaluated by Eq. (1). For the Parkinson’s disease detection, the MLP was com-
pulsory to be 1 and 0 for healthy people. The algorithm which was applied for this
network was Levenberg–Marquardt back-propagation optimization. An accuracy of
96.32% was achieved for the training set with MLP method. The structure for MLP
method was shown in Fig. 1.
Nanda et al. (2015) has worked to ﬁnd the basic difference between essential
tremor and Parkinson’s tremor, as both the tremors are alike and are very difﬁcult to
distinguish neurologically [18]. Before this work, mathematically the analysis of
tremor was done successfully using non-invasive recording techniques. But the

classiﬁcation of tremor signal from EMG has not been done accurately because of
some problems like overlapping of frequencies. Therefore, to minimize this dis-
crepancy, in this work, the neural network technique has classiﬁed the tremor
sEMG signals with 91.66% accuracy. This suggested classiﬁcation algorithm added
intensity to the non-invasive signal detection methods at reduced cost and higher
sensitivity.
In 2016, Shijiya et al. worked for automated analysis of EMG signals for dif-
ferent diseases due to muscular disorders [19]. This technique has useful for
automated feature extraction and classiﬁcation of EMG signals for diseases like
Parkinson’s disease and myopathy. In this work, 35 signals out of 75 signals were
taken classiﬁed properly. The architecture which was used in their work is shown in
Fig. 2.

Fig. 2 Neural network architecture

R. Dey et al.

As a result, from the EMG signal of selected signal length, the spectral and
temporal features were extracted properly. By using those extracted features, the
PD’s tremor can be detected properly.
Challa et al. in 2016 has performed a comparative study among different
machine learning models like MLP and random forest [20]. By this comparative
study, it was concluded which model will be superior for the early prediction of
Parkinson’s disease. According to the study, the MLP technique is a feed-forward
method. The basic theory of MLP network was that it takes input and maps it to a
nonlinear space and then it tries to predict those corresponding outputs. The
back-propagation algorithm is the main technique which governs this training
model of MLP network.

Discussion
This study reports the signiﬁcance for classiﬁcation of EMG signals by MLP
network technique, which is very essential for detecting several muscular and
neuromuscular disorders. As EMG signal is very prone to noise interference,
therefore the researchers tend to focus on the accurate classiﬁcation of EMG signal.
There are various techniques used for nonlinear classiﬁcation of EMG signals using
ANN; among those techniques MLP was used initially as it was found better than
other techniques. But as work progressed, many new techniques of ANN were
invented and also implemented for EMG classiﬁcation for better result.
Though there are few demerits of using MLP technique nowadays, the advan-
tages of MLP network have been focused in this review work. As it can represent
multiple set of functions unlike generalized linear network, each layer has a set of
adaptive weights, layers that are neither input nor output are considered as hidden
and they are also included to give the total output. Therefore, the total output
calculated by MLP techniques gives satisfactory result.

Conclusion
This review work contributes a general summary on how EMG signal systems are
outlined, also how the MLP technology is being used to classify those signals. The
growth and innovations of the researchers over years have resulted on several
techniques for the nonlinear classiﬁcation of EMG signal using various methods for
the detecting the tremor in Parkinson’s patients [21–24]. Current advancement in
the study of EMG signal has accumulated and investigated mainly the classiﬁcation
of EMG signal for PD’s tremor detection. From those researches that were made, a
deduction can be drawn that repeated efforts are required to make EMG signals
more accessible, and the technology of MLP should be improved more to classify
the EMG signal with total precision and accuracy.

Introduction
In modern living, the gene expression information has been widely analyzed by
both theoretic and experiment ways. The analysis of bacteria on cell is straight-
forward to do this analysis of sequence of data [1]. A noise present in the gene
expression data very critical process in the living system and toughness to blast is
supposed one of the foremost devise moralities of the connected gene rigid net-
works [2]. Basically, the images are converted into microarray information, which
has to be distorted into gene expression matrix in which horizontal line stands for
genes, vertical line stands for various samples like tissues or investigation situation,
and information in every cell exemplify the appearance point of scrupulous gene in
the exacting taster. Newly gene appearance proﬁles are additional favored structure
of disease classiﬁcation scheme than morphology [3]. In which classiﬁes model
based on the gene data samples for different predeﬁned diseases. Existing system
used various statistical techniques like naive Bayes approach, logistic regression,
least square, discrimination methods, nearest neighbor for generate classiﬁer model
[4]. These statistical approaches frequently effect in an unbendable taxonomy
scheme that is powerless to organize a sample, if the expressions of genes are to
some extent sundry beginning the predeﬁned summary. Machine learning
approaches resembling support vector machine and artiﬁcial neural networks have
been effectively functional to categorize microarray data [5]. Classifying microarray
data using support vector machine and machine learning algorithms like artiﬁcial
neural networks has been effectively applied. Still, these approaches fabricate
high-quality categorization accurateness; the results formed through them are
inﬂexible to interpret. The rule-based classiﬁer model is one of the classiﬁer models
used to construct decision tree; however, the rules formed by them include in nature
signiﬁcant requisites, and it is a perceptive kind of classiﬁer. Diminutive conﬂicts in
the exercise model show the technique to bulky difference in the hierarchy for-
mation [6]. A new ﬁgurative machine learning to move toward is planned to extort
human being sensible convention commencing resolution trees. The appearance of
DNA microarray technologies in excess of the earlier episode decade has efﬁcient
the progress in the direction of biological investigate in such a method that sci-
entists be capable of calculate the expression levels of thousands of genes con-
currently [7]. This high-throughput investigations information have permitted for
modern explore to discover complex communications linking genes. Gene regu-
latory network (GRN) refers to a collection of molecular machinery, together with
genes, proteins, and further molecules, as well as the connections among these

molecules that cooperatively take away a cellular task. The essential thought at the
rear GRN examination is to take out prominent gene dogmatic facial appearance by
probing gene appearance pattern [8]. Our conventional move toward to categorize
gene despotic affairs is the triumph research, in which the expression levels of an
exacting gene are decreased even as all further situations are reserved invariable.
This approach is suitable for small number of genes, but this approach cannot be
scaled up to study rigid networks consisting of hundreds of genes appropriate to the
absolute quantity of investigation manipulations required to expose an entire reg-
ulatory network.

larity such as nonparametric t-test, Pearson’s correlation, and Mann–Whitney or
rank sum test; these model biologically similar genes are measured under certain
noise-level value. In particular, the molecular biology ﬁeld various researches
involved for development of similarities in large number of gene using conven-

Distance measure between the pair of genes, a choice of geometric formula are
second-hand to estimate the connection of the brace of gene dataset like variance
increase distance, Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance, average intracluster
distance, and average intercluster distance. Generally, the cluster investigation is
based on the two ingredients such as distance measure cluster algorithm and, from
which distance measure is quantiﬁcation of similarity or dissimilarity between the
two objects and cluster algorithms procedure to group the objects within small
cluster distance [10]. The probability model is another method used to express
relationship between different experimental conditions and also to form a set of
disjoint bicluster in a supervised manner. The novel-based approach used in
biclustering combines statistical consideration and graph theoretic to ﬁnd similar
expression pattern over a subset of conditions, and the gene is signiﬁcantly changed
based on the subset of values.

Results and Discussion
Testing the signiﬁcance of values was made by either parametric or nonparametric.
Generally, the parametric tests are suitable when the sample size is very large and
nonparametric are suitable, when the gene size is small [11]. As per the statistical
method even the size of data is either large or small, it can analyze only the part of
data according to hypothesis. The parametric test has following methods like Z-test
and t-test that are based on the assumption that the random samples are selected
from a normal population. The nonparametric test is also called as distribution free
method, in which single mathematical equation used for calculating distribution
under certain conditions. The proposed method has gene expression data with set of
row and column that is called as microarray, in which Mann–Whitney U test is
applied to measure the signiﬁcance of genes. Nonparametric test has following
advantages such as test generally simple to understand, quicker, and easier to apply
when sample sizes are small. It will assume the part of data so does not need
lengthily calculation. Mann–Whitney U test is a nonparametric test; therefore, it
does not presuppose some assumptions associated to the delivery. On the other
hand, a quantity of assumptions that are tacit one is the taster drawn from the
populace is arbitrary and subsequent is self-determination surrounded by the
samples and reciprocated sovereignty is implicit, and third is ordinal extent scale is
understood.

Abnormalities
Saikat Chatterjee and Anjan Kumar Ray
Abstract Osteoblast bone cell is major part where different types of abnormalities
are identiﬁed and analyzed. In these papers, electrical modeling of abnormal
osteoblast cell is represented. Due to the presence of external ﬁeld, the membrane
potential as well as membrane current also varies. It is also observed that membrane
potential of osteosarcoma cell increases compared to normal osteoblast cell.
According to the value of membrane current or potential as well as nucleus
membrane potential, different abnormalities can be identiﬁed.

Introduction
Osteoblast cell is important part of bone cell. It consists of mainly two parts: the cell
membrane and nucleus membrane, which are consider here as two spherical plate of
the capacitor. The membrane potential of the osteoblast cell can varied according to
the external ﬁeld applied on it. Osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma,
pleomorphic, and ﬁbro sarcoma are the different examples of abnormalities of
osteoblast cell where some abnormalities are also related to the cancer. Due to
abnormal growth of osteoblast bone cell, it forms tumor (osteosarcoma). Due to the
abnormalities in the osteoblast cell, there must be change in its internal operation as
well as internal structure. The electrical modeling of ideal osteoblast cell is con-
ﬁgured in this study for analyzing its abnormalities during different stages. Due to
the effect of different electric ﬁeld, the cell membrane potential and nucleus

membrane potential will vary. Different abnormalities [1] of osteoblast cell were
represented through electrical modeling, showing the effect of different electrodes
(different shaped and thickness) through membrane potential and nucleus potential.
The graphical output of every case will provide us a speciﬁc message.

Electrical Modeling of Human Cell
Human cell electrical modeling [2] is performed on the basis of variation of action
potential. The action potential of human cell generates due to the generation of
potential difference in cell membrane [1, 2]. Transfer of different ions (Na+, Ca++, K+)
from intercellular or intracellular level generates the potential difference in cell which
is considered as action potential [3, 4]. Here, action potential represents the main role
for the modeling (Fig. 1).
2.1
Electrical Modeling of Human Bone Cell
(Osteoblast Cell)
Here, osteoblast cell modeling is performed in same manner (Fig. 2). The RC
coupling part is related to the self-generated action potential due to external applied
ﬁeld. Here, C1 and R1 combinations are representing the self-generated circuit part
which is affected by the external applied ﬁeld. The internal parts (C2, R2, R3)
represent the nucleus where R3 represents internal resistance of the osteoblast cell.
C and R represent the total store charge and total resistance of the membrane
potential.

Abnormalities of Osteoblast Cell
Osteoblast cell consists of speciﬁc part of the bone cell. If there any abnormality [3]
occurs, then it will have effect on its function. There are different types of abnor-
malities that are identiﬁed. According to that, different diseases are diagnosis. The
different abnormalities are:
• Osteosarcoma,
• Chondrosarcoma,
• Ewing’s sarcoma.
3.1
Osteosarcoma
Osteoblastcellconsists ofosteoidtissue,andduetouncontrolledcelldivision, there will
be generation of tumor from osteoid tissue. Mainly on knee and upper arm, this tumor
occurs. Due to uncontrolled cell division, huge number of osteoblast cells generate, but
the quantity of cytoplasm and nucleoplasm is reduced, which affect the main function of
osteoblast cell. It may have effect on the average age of osteoblast cell. There is no
swelling in bone, and it is not visible from outside. Osteosarcoma [3] is a cancerous
tumor inabone.Itismostprevalentinchildrenandyoungadults.Osteosarcomastendto
occur at the sites of bone growth, because proliferation makes osteoblast cells in this
region prone to acquire mutations that could lead to transformation of cells.
3.2
Electrical Modeling of Osteosarcoma Cell
Figure 3 shows the electrical model of osteosarcoma bone cell [4]. Due to
uncontrolled cell division, all new cells are not ideal and healthy condition.

The quantity of cytoplasm and nucleus is decreased compared to ideal one. Due to
decrease in the quantity of nucleoplasm, the internal resistance of nucleoplasm
increases and charge decreases. But in case of cytoplasm, internal resistance
decreases and charge increases.
4
Microelectrode
Different microelectrodes [5] were applied to the osteoblast cell for observing the
variation of membrane potential of nucleus and cytoplasm. Due to different shape
and thickness of microelectrodes, the ﬁeld intensity (Table 1) will vary to a certain
range. In our study, the ranges of ﬁeld intensity for different shaped electrodes were
taken into consideration (Fig. 4). We are calculating the equivalent ﬁeld voltage
with implementing equivalent electrical modeling.
5
Result Analysis
When external ﬁeld is applied across ideal osteoblast [6] cell for rectangular shaped
electrodes and different thickness (1 µm), the resulting membrane potential is as
follows. MULTISIM 10 software is used for the circuit conﬁguration (Fig. 5).
Here, (Figs. 6 and 7) according to the plot, membrane current and membrane
potential [7, 8] in presence of rectangular electrode (µA) remain unchanged to a

Conclusion
From Figs. 8 and 10, it is found that transmembrane potential (nucleus membrane)
of osteosarcoma (malignant cell) increases compared to osteoblast cell. It is also
observed that its membrane potential reduces with increased ﬁeld voltage and the
membrane current also reduces with increased ﬁeld voltage. With the analysis of the
membrane potential and membrane current, different abnormalities of bone cell can
be identiﬁed.

Dimensionality Reduction of Facial
Features to Recognize Emotion State
Kiran P. Gaikwad, C.M. Sheela Rani, S.B. Mahajan
and P. Sanjeevikumar
Abstract Lots of applications are based on facial emotion recognition such as
action recognition in computer games, medical, and human–computer interaction.
In past, number of approaches is proposed to recognize human emotions based on
facial expressions by extracting facial features. As the number of facial features
increases, the complexity level for recognizing expressions becomes high.
Relatively, limited work is done on dimensionality reduction, which restricts the
accuracy and robustness of the emotion. In this paper, work is done on dimen-
sionality reduction of facial features and use of minimum number of facial features
to represent emotion states.

Introduction
Human–human communication includes spoken language. But in the absence of
language, nonverbal information such as facial expressions, tone of the voice, and
hand gestures is used. Human–computer interfaces evolved from conventional
interfaces to modern advanced interfaces such as automatic speech recognition
systems and special interfaces designed for handicapped people. Though these
interfaces changed the way of human–computer interaction, it is not taking complete
advantage of these valuable communicative abilities. It results often in a less than
natural interaction. Information of an emotional state is usually extracted from facial
expressions which are completely dependent on facial attribute. If computers could
recognize these emotional inputs accurately, then it could give speciﬁc and appro-
priate help to users with the user’s needs and preferences. Surprise, fear, disgust,
anger, happiness, and sadness are the six different human emotions that are classi-
ﬁed. Facial expressions and the tone of the speech play a major role in expressing
these emotions. Previous study shows that the results to recognize emotion state with
the use of facial expressions are more relevant than results obtained with tone of
speech. Major part is played with facial expressions in the detection of emotions. As
less work is carried out on emotion detection using facial expressions, scope is wide.
Accuracy of emotion state recognition depends on the discriminant facial features
extracted from facial expression. Lot of approaches has been suggested such as
principle component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to
extract the facial features. Recent techniques which are used to extract features are
based on 2D discriminant analysis (2DDA) [1]. 2D LDA (2DLDA) and 2D PCA
(2DPCA) are two representative methods which extract features from one direction.
These techniques signiﬁcantly reduce the feature extraction time than traditional
PCA and LDA; Features are combined using row and column directions i.e.
two-directional 2D LDA ((2D) 2LDA) and two-directional 2D PCA ((2D) 2 PCA)
techniques
used.
These
methods
make
more
efﬁcient
representation
than
one-directional feature extraction approaches. Here, experimentation is carried out
on facial expressions with two-dimensional maximum margin criteria and found
reduction in facial feature vector size. This dimensionality reduction in feature vector
has less space complexity and time complexity for recognizing emotion state.

Motivation and Related Work
Various works are carried out to recognize emotion state. Some of them used tone
of speech, and others used facial expressions. Some emotions are better identiﬁed
with audio and others with video. It is showed that these two modalities give
complementary information, by arguing that the performance of the system
increased when both modalities were considered together [2]. Several automatic
emotion recognition systems have explored to locate human affective state by using
720

facial expressions or speech [3–5]. Very few efforts have focused on emotion
recognition using both modalities. Variety of face expression analysis systems have
been developed [6–9]. It is observed that the performance emotion recognition
system based on facial expression is better than emotion recognition based on
acoustic information. Image-based approaches process facial expressions based on
2D information, whereas geometric-based techniques share some common advan-
tages such as explicit face structure. Dictionary-based approach for facial expres-
sion analysis is used [10]. This dictionary consists of AU-blocks. It has a structure;
it is used to capture the high-level knowledge regarding AUs. Composition rules of
AUs are extracted from FACS. To represent this knowledge in the sparse codes
while designing the dictionaries, a two-layer approach for grouping the dictionary
atoms is proposed. AU-layer is a lower layer which groups dictionary atoms cor-
responding to each AU. Expression layer is the top layer which uses the high-level
knowledge to group different AUs that are composed to form an expression (e.g.,
sad, happy, and angry). This approach represents and characterizes a target facial
expression with information extracted from a set of prototype models [11]. Initially,
a set of prototype facial expression models are generated as a reference space of
expressions. On this reference, space face images are projected which generates a
set of registered face images. Facial expression appearance is characterized based
on histograms of oriented gradients of each image. The obtained descriptors are
then fed to the SVM for classiﬁcation.
3
Emotion Recognition System
Proposed emotion recognition system consists of three modules. First is feature
extraction module which extracts the discriminate facial features. Once the features
are extracted, it is classiﬁed using second module, feature classiﬁcation module. So,
all the relevant features of respective emotions form a feature space. Then, ﬁnally
using the third module, emotion states are recognized.
3.1
Feature Extraction Module
First step of emotion recognition system based on facial expression is feature
extraction. Facial features are extracted using Two-Dimensional Maximum Margin
Criteria (2D2MMC). Figure 1 depicts the block schematic of feature extraction
module.
Initially, all the face images are aligned with cropping in one standard size
92  112. Images contain only facial expression. 2D2MMC extracts discriminant
vectors from two directions and ﬁnds two optimal projectors in two directions as
follows:

Experimental Result and Performance Analysis
Experiments are designed using standard Georgia Technology Face Database [12,
13]. This database contains 50 classes. All the images are resized to same size, and
initially, feature extraction process is applied to the standard database. As more
discriminant features are extracted, out of that only more distinguishing discrimi-
nant features are selected by feature selection criteria. As here, feature vector of size
4  6 is very less as compared to other feature vectors obtained. So, space com-
plexity as well as time complexity of emotion state recognition is reduced.

database containing 110 person’s expressions (with 10 varying experssion images
for each person) is analyzed. Out of 10 images, four images which are expressing
different emotion states are used for generating the emotion state database and
others are used as test dataset. The recognition rate for the respective emotion state
is 98.01%. Following are some classes on which experimentation is performed. The
result of emotion state recognition is displayed in Fig. 2 (class-I) and Fig. 3
(class-II). The different emotion states are recognized with variation in facial
expression. The recognition rate for different emotion states with given standard
database is given in Table 1.

Conclusion
Though number of approaches is used to implement and recognize emotion state
from facial expressions, the complexity level increases as extracted facial features
are large in amount based on facial expressions. With the help of proper feature
selection criteria, minimum discriminant invariant facial features are selected to
decide the emotion state. With the experimental results, the minimum number of the
feature vectors to represent the facial characteristics is 24, and size of feature vector
is (6  4). This reduced dimensionality of feature space. And hence space com-
plexity is reduced.

Electro-Optically Tunable Switching
Action Enhanced by Long-Range
Surface Plasmon
Arijit Ghosh
Abstract By using analytical method, this paper depicts long-range surface
plasmon-enabled electro-optically adjustable switching action by Goos–Hänchen
shift for an alterable index of refraction of dielectric layer in Kretschmann–Reather
geometry which is developed by a BK7 prism, 5000 nm liquid crystal layer which
may be considered as dielectric. This layer is sandwiched between 50 and 200 nm
thin two gold layers. Here the phase difference varies from positive to negative with
the incident angle of the fundamental light beam. This action can be achieved
because of varying index of refraction of the dielectric layer with the applied
external potential difference. In this scheme, Goos–Hänchen shift also plays a vital
role for optical switching.

Introduction
Surface plasmon is a phenomenon that occurs when the coherent electrons oscillate
at the contact area within any two materials. The reason for this phenomenon is due
to the changes of sign of real part of dielectric function throughout the junction
(e.g., metal–dielectric or dielectric–metal interface). This phenomenon can be
detected in some materials such as gold (Au), silver (Ag), copper (Cu), and
sometimes in aluminum (Al) also for their low value of ionization potential [1, 2]. If
a P-polarized highly directive laser beam incidents on a multilayered structure with
an angle which is greater than the critical angle of the medium, an electromagnetic
wave generates which is known as evanescent wave. This wave penetrates up to the
last layer of that structure. Due to this wave, surface plasmon created among the

ﬁrst time surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and Kretschmann–Reather geometry
shows the phenomenon long-range surface plasmon (LRSP).
2
Proposed Scheme
In this proposed scheme ﬁrst time designed and simulated enhanced by LRSP
electro-optically adjustable switching using Goos–Hänchen shift (GH shift). In the
suggested system, a liquid crystal layer of polyamide (p = 1.78, d3 = 5 µm) which
can be considered as dielectric layer [3] is placed between two thin metal layers of
gold (p = 0.583 + 9.86i). The thicknesses of these two layers are 50 and 100 nm,
respectively, at a wavelength of 1550 nm at a temperature of 25 °C [4]. Here the
incident radiation is generated by an external laser cavity which is tuned at a
wavelength of 1550 nm. The fundamental wavelength is developed by using
gain-switched DFB laser which is functioning at a wavelength of 1550 nm, which
can generate 30-ps pulses [5]. The laser radiation appears on the bottom surface of
the prism with a speciﬁc angle which is more than critical angle of the medium [6].
When light appears at the lower edge of the prism, it will generate two surface
plasmons at two metal–dielectric interfaces and coupled together at off-resonance
condition which leads to LRSP condition. Later on that LRSP light is reﬂected back
from the surface of the prism where the laser light has been incident. As the incident
angle of the fundamental light beam is more than the critical angle of the surface
then total internal reﬂection will occur. It is well known that during total internal
reﬂection of light beam GH shift will be observed [7, 8]. This shift can be calculated
with surface plasmon by the given equation
S ¼  1
n

ð1Þ
In this equation, b is deﬁned by phase difference between the incident light beam
and reﬂected light beam, a can be deﬁned as the angle of incident light beam, and
n can be expressed as the wave vector in the medium of incidence. If for the surface
plasmon the fundamental laser beam is TM-polarized then the coefﬁcient of
reﬂection of the multilayered proposed optical system can be depicted as [9],

where X and Y are the numerator and dominator of Eq. (2), respectively. With the
help of equations above, the value of GH shift in the proposed multilayered LRSP
conﬁguration can be calculated. Here the index of refraction of the liquid crystal can
vary from 1.5 to 1.85 with the applied potential difference as shown in Fig. 2. The
incident angle versus phase difference graph is shown in Fig. 3.

Conclusion
Simulated data clearly indicate that at 80.7° incident angle the phase difference
changed drastically from positive to negative. This property can be used for the
optical switching for any device. By using this proposed scheme and varying the
external voltage applied on the dielectric layer (liquid crystal) tunable switching can
be obtained. This structure can be used for any small application because all
components which are used here are in micro-level structure.

Introduction
AC drives based on multiphase (multiple stator winding >3) conﬁguration are
known for its high reliability, redundant structure, limited DC-link ripple, increased
power density, fault tolerance, and low-voltage/high-current per phase inverter
rating [1–5]. Multilevel inverters (MLIs) are renowned solution for high-voltage
synthesis by multiple DC sources, limited total harmonic distortion (THD), and
reduced dv/dt in the output voltages [6–12]. It has been proven that the combination
of the multiphase and multilevel inverter is redundancy and fault tolerance AC
drives [13–20]. But, failures are persistence multilevel inverters, (31–37.9%) by
IGBT’s mechanism. Other facts are discrete capacitors and current gate control
techniques [1–5]. Still, the reliability of the standard two-level VSI is governed to
frame multiphase and multilevel AC drives with redundant structures [1–20]. The
isolated/non-isolated multilevel AC converter is reconﬁgured from quad-inverter
conﬁguration for star-winding loads. The dual three phases (twelve phases) are
derived by two adjacent windings spatially shifted by 30° (symmetrical type) [15–
22] or by 15° (asymmetrical) [15–22] as shown in Fig. 1. This article develops an
optimal strategy based on single carrier zero-shifted ﬁve-level modulation
(SCZSFM) dual six-phase asymmetrical/symmetrical converter as [15–22]. The
proposed single carrier modulation algorithm (independent modulation) is used to
regulate VSIs as a ﬁve-level standard multilevel inverters (MLIs) [15, 22]. Modular
structure as four classical two-level VSIs. Further, each phase of VSIs as one
bidirectional (IGBT) and switch linking the neutral with two capacitors. Features of
the proposed class are that each VSI generates ﬁve-level line-to-line output with
star-winding conﬁguration. Conﬁrming the total electric power quadrupling and are
shared four isolated/non-isolated DC sources VSI’s (H). Moreover, the reliability is
governed under faulty conditions, i.e. one or two or three VSIs fail. Therefore,
complete AC drive propagates with least one healthy VSI but with reduced power.
Effectiveness to verify the proposed multilevel modulation, whole AC drive system
is numerically modelled and executed with MATLAB/PLECS simulation soft-
wares. Set of results which are observed are depicted in the paper under balanced
conditions to show the proper ﬁve-level outputs modulation. It is always agreed
with the results shown are close conformity by a performance with developed
theoretical background

Split-Phase Decomposition SVT
The twelve-phase star-winding system is expressed by stationary space vectors
(multiple) [22]. By expression (1) a = exp (j2p/12) for the symmetrical and a =

Now, the bidirectional switches and two capacitors are neglected in Fig. 1, the
resultant four standard two-level inverters with isolated/non-isolated DC source.
Further, the modulations are carried out as two-level VSIs. Applying space vector
theory, the v output voltage vector of twelve-phase AC drive is given by [15–22]:

The SCZSFM algorithm for the dual six-phase converter is shown in Figs. 2 and 3
[15–22]. Against the single triangular carrier, the modulating reference signals
(zero-shifted) are compared to utilize the maximum DC for proper ﬁve-level mul-
tilevel outputs. Figure 2a elaborates the single carrier zero-shifted ﬁve-level modu-
lation algorithm of phase ‘a’ of VSIH
(1), and the same applies to other phases of the
VSI [18, 19]. The detailed zero-shifted reference signal for switch SH1, (red) and S′H1,
(blue). For phase ‘a’ VSIH
(1), the bidirectional switch SHa modulates entire funda-
mental period and generates an additional level to the inverter outputs swap {1, 0}
always. The switch SH1 will modulate in the ﬁrst half-cycle ON-state and the second
half-cycle OFF-state always in the whole fundamental period. The switch S′H1 will
modulate in vice versa to the device SH1. Correspondingly, switching pattern for
VSIH
(1) is depicted in Fig. 3 for modulation index 0.8 [22]. The same strategy is
applied to all other leg phases (b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l) of VSIs (VSIH
(2), VSIH
(3),
VSIH
(4)), with the appropriate phase shifts between reference modulating signals
(a = exp (j2p/12) symmetrical or a = exp (jp/12) asymmetrical). Figure 3 depicts
the switch pattern for inverters VSIH
(1) with a modulation index of 0.8 [15–22].

Numerical Simulation Results and Discussion
The whole AC drive system is numerically developed in MATLAB/PLECS sim-
ulation software and tested for symmetrical, balanced operation with ﬁxed modu-
lation index 0.8. Parameters taken for investigation for the AC drive are given in
Table 1. The complete behaviour of the proposed-AC multilevel converter system
is elaborated in Fig. 4. By detail, Fig. 4a, b shows line-to-line voltages of the
ﬁrst-phase, fourth-phase windings of VSIs (VSIH
(1) and VSIH
(2)) of the symmetrical
isolated/non-isolated converter. Correspondingly, ﬁrst the fundamental components
are shown in the same ﬁgure and proven that amplitude is equal in magnitude.
Second, it could be observed that the line-to-line voltages are spatially shifted by
30° as predicted. Third, each VSI is modulated to ﬁve levels of the developed single
carrier zero-shifted ﬁve-level modulation (SCZFFM) algorithm [15–22]. Figure 4c,
d shows the generated phase voltage of the ﬁrst-phase (‘a’) {1}, fourth-phase (‘d’)
{2} of the twelve-phase winding converter. Correspondingly ﬁrst, phase voltages
depicted with their fundamental components as time-averaged scale, proven that
amplitude is equal in magnitude. Secondly, as predicted the voltage generated as
seven-levels and in agreement with Eqs. (4)–(7). Third, the phase voltages are

spatially shifted by 30° which is clearly noticed between voltages of star-windings
{1} to {4}. Correspondingly, twelve-phase star-windings currents are shown in
Fig. 4e, f, g, h, respectively. First, it is observed that twelve-phase currents are
sinusoidal, balanced, equal in amplitude and spatial displacement of 30° between
phases and smoothly propagated as predicted [15–22]. Observed results prove the
set of developed theoretical background.

Conclusion
This paper investigated an isolated/non-isolated twelve-phase inverter conﬁguration
for
optimal
single
carrier-based
ﬁve-level
modulation
strategy.
Developed
pulse-width modulation behaves as ﬁve-level modulation and modulated the stan-
dard three-phase inverter as a multilevel converter. The numerical simulation
software’s modelling results are presented by developed theoretical developments.
Pulse-width modulation algorithm can be easily implemented in any industry
standard digital controller for realization
with less computational burden.
Investigation results suit for multiple batteries (isolated version) or fuel-cell-fed
systems for (low-voltage–high-current) electrical vehicles, AC tractions, and ‘more
electric aircraft’ (MEA) applications.
