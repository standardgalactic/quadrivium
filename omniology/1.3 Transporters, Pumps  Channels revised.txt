TRANSPORTERS,  
PUMPS, & CHANNELS  
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
• Describe how solutes cross cell membranes 
• Explain how charge, size, and solubility affect 
solute movement across cell membranes. 
• Contrast how transporters, pumps &  
     channels work 
• Describe how ion channels are gated.  
  











GENERAL CONCEPTS 
1. Movement of a solute across the lipid bilayer (cell membrane) 
is dependent on its size, charge, and solubility. 
2.   Net flux (movement) of a solute is determined by gradients.   
3.   A permeable solute crosses the membrane by simple 
diffusion (slow), moving down its concentration gradient.  
4.   A non-permeable solute crosses the membrane by  
facilitated diffusion (fast) using transporters. This process  
requires a gradient, is saturable, and is specific.  
5.  Primary active transport moves a solute against its  
concentration gradient. This mechanism requires energy (ATP),  
exhibits specificity, and is saturable. 
6.  Secondary active transport couples the activity of a co-transporter 
with a pump. This is used for transcellular transport of a solute.
