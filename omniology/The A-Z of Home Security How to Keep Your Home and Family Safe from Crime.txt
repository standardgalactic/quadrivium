Introduction
Most people know somebody who has been the victim of crime, or 
they have been a victim themselves. Most people also think that 
there isn’t much they can do to avoid it.
They are wrong! There is a lot that the average person can do to 
protect themselves, their family and their property. This A–Z of 
Home Security will show you how to perform a security review on 
various different aspects of your home and property, and then 
take steps to increase your security and avoid crime.
HOW THIS BOOK CAME ABOUT
I have been in the security field for nearly 30 years, serving as 
a police officer, working in government security and working 
as a security consultant. I have written this book, based on the 
knowledge I have gained from that experience, to inform you of 
the measures you can take to avoid crime.
Generally, statistics show a steady increase in crime, but with 
some simple facts and information, you can take steps to protect 
yourself, your family and your property from crime.

Chapter 1  · Introduction
About half of those who responded to an insurance company 
survey stated that their greatest worry was that they would be 
a victim of crime. They also reported that they had not done 
anything to protect themselves from the crime they were so 
worried about, because they didn’t think there was anything they 
could do. There was a feeling that ‘If it’s your turn, then it’s going 
to happen.’
You need to know what you can do to protect yourself. Simple 
information can help. Did you know, for instance, that a house at 
the end of a terrace, on a corner, with an alley or a public footpath 
running down the side or any other public access around it is a lot 
more likely to be burgled?
Being aware of the threats and taking steps to protect yourself 
and your property, will make you a lot less likely to become 
a victim of crime. This book helps you to identify potential 
vulnerabilities, threats and risks (we will call them all ‘problems’ 
from now on), then to propose simple, affordable and achievable 
countermeasures that the average person can implement to 
increase their levels of security.
INCREASING YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND
KNOWLEDGE
Crime statistics are quite worrying, but they can help us too. Look 
at these statistics.
At least 80% of burglars are opportunists; they look for a 
quick and easy way in and out. Nip next door without locking 

the front door and your wallet or handbag may be gone when 
you get back home.
At least 20% of burglars don’t have to force entry, they just 
walk in through open doors and windows!
About 60% of burglars enter the target premises from the rear 
– where there is less chance of them being spotted and/or 
reported.
More burglaries happen during the day than at night, when 
it is quiet and more people are at home to hear and report 
strange intruders.
Does that worry you? It looks like good news to me, because these 
statistics tell me how I can best protect my house and belongings 
by adopting the following countermeasures.
9By always locking doors and windows and never leaving 
valuables in a vulnerable place, we deny access to the 
opportunist thief.
9By stopping strangers from easily getting to the back of our 
house by erecting fences and installing lockable side gates, we 
block the most common access points for burglars.
9By making sure the house is securely locked during the day, 
we ensure that it is as safe as it can be, and further reduce the 
chance of being burgled.
If you adopt those three countermeasures, you have probably 
made your house at least 70% less likely to become the victim of 
opportunist theft and domestic burglary – and that’s not a bad 
result considering this is only page 3!

Chapter 1  · Introduction
That is the end of lesson one and it doesn’t get any harder. Read 
this book, learning how to identify vulnerabilities, then take steps 
to remove or reduce the vulnerabilities, and you and your family 
will be considerably safer. To improve security you need common 
sense, time to read this book and identify problems, then time to 
apply countermeasures to resolve them.
To manage the problems you identify I recommend that you take a 
methodical approach. As you identify and consider any problems, 
record them with any countermeasures you have identified. The 
following form shows one method of recording problems and 
countermeasures, but you are free to use your own method.
Home Security Review, Mr A. Biggins 49 High Street – 29 Feb 200X
PROBLEM
Two gaps in back hedge, behind the garage and at the end of the 
fence where children break through to collect their balls.
OTHER INFORMATION
Children playing on grass area beside the house have broken 
through the hedge to retrieve footballs kicked into the garden.
The Council are planting trees and prickly shrubs there to stop 
children playing and to improve the look of the area – there should 
be no more ball games there after the end of the month. 
COUNTERMEASURES
(a) Dig out the whole hedge and replace it with a six-feet-high 
chain-link fence.
(b) Plant prickly shrubs among the hedge plants, making sure to fill 
in the gaps with them.
(c) Leave the hedge as it is but put a chain-link wire fence up on the 
outside of the hedge.

Chapter 1  · Introduction 5
As you can see, the form records problems, additional information 
and potential countermeasures. Use a new form to record each 
problem; this will help you to manage them as you improve your 
security.
Give each form a title. Identify possible countermeasures yourself 
or take them from the lists of countermeasures in this book. Using 
a new form for each problem:
will give you a record of all problems identified. (Keep these 
forms safe, and shred them when you have finished with 
them; they are a burglar’s guide to vulnerabilities in your 
house.)
allows you to gradually review and refine your understanding 
of the problems as you research them. The council may have 
plans to erect a fence along the boundary, which will resolve 
your problem at no cost or effort to you!
helps you to understand the problem, and add to and refine 
the possible countermeasures. If you can’t get planning 
permission for a fence, plant prickly shrubs to repair and 
reinforce the existing hedge.
makes it easy for you to review and sort the problems, putting 
them in priority order. If you only have two problems, one of 
which is the gaps in the hedge, and the other is that the front 
door cannot be locked, repairing the front door is a priority 
and the hedge can wait!
makes it easy for you to analyse and select the appropriate 
countermeasures. By crossing out discarded countermeasures 
you arrive at a record showing the problem and the selected 
countermeasure(s).

Chapter 1  · Introduction
COUNTERMEASURES
(a)
Dig out the whole hedge and replace it with a six-feet-high 
chain-link fence. No planning permission will be given.
(b) Plant prickly shrubs among the hedge plants, making sure to fill 
in the gaps with them.
(c)
Leave the hedge as it is but put a chain-link wire fence up on the 
outside of the hedge. No planning permission will be given.
Work through this book, reading each section, then review your 
security. Identify your own vulnerabilities, especially any that 
may be unique to you and your property. If you live on an island, 
your unique problem may be an unlocked and readily available 
motor boat that could be a significant security risk to you.
As you identify problems, record them. Where you can, identify 
and record any possible countermeasures at the same time. 
It is likely that for some problems you may have to leave the 
countermeasures section blank, coming back to add some when 
you have had time to think, or you have taken advice from 
specialists.
IMPLEMENTING COUNTERMEASURES TO YOUR
PROBLEMS
When you identify a problem there are basically four things that 
you can do about that risk:

Chapter 1  · Introduction 7
Ignore it and hope it goes away.
Take action to reduce the risk.
Take action to avoid the risk.
Take action to remove the risk – by introducing a 
countermeasure without taking new and unnecessary risks. 
A countermeasure is something that you can do to improve 
your security and safety.
My objective is to teach you how to identify problems, and then 
how to propose and implement appropriate, achievable and 
affordable countermeasures to increase your security.
Through I provide lists of possible countermeasures, none of 
the lists is exhaustive; they are simply examples of possible 
countermeasures. The lists may provide an appropriate 
countermeasure for your problem, or they may help you to define 
your own countermeasures.
Suppose the problem you identified is shards of broken glass on 
the living room couch. The four options are:
Ignore it – keep using the living room and hope that nobody 
gets hurt when they sit on the broken glass.
Reduce the risk – keep using the living room, but warn people 
not to use the couch because of the broken glass.
Avoid it – never go into the living room again, so you will not 
be injured by broken glass.

8
Chapter 1  · Introduction
Remove it – buy and use gardening gloves and goggles to 
pick up the larger pieces of glass. Use a dustpan to sweep up 
the smaller pieces. Finally rent a powerful industrial vacuum 
cleaner to remove the final traces of broken glass before 
anyone uses the living room again.
Though all options would work, some may be more acceptable 
and sensible to you and some may seem unrealistic or foolhardy 
to you, bearing in mind your lifestyle and circumstances.
For most people, the last option, ‘removing the risk’, will be the 
most effective long-term solution, even though it requires time, 
money and effort to achieve it. Knowing your lifestyle and 
circumstances you are free to adapt the approach to suit your 
circumstances.
By understanding the problems you face, recognizing the options 
open to you, and adapting them to your own preferences, you can 
amend a proposed countermeasure to suit your circumstances. 
Throughout this book, your primary objectives will be the 
following.
Recognize problems that exist and how they can affect you 
and your security.
Look beyond the examples listed, to identify problems 
appropriate to your unique circumstances.
Study those problems and identify countermeasures that will 
avoid, remove or reduce them.

Chapter 1  · Introduction 9
Compile an action plan, defining the actions you need to take 
to deliver the selected countermeasure.
Continually monitor your life, to recognize any changes that 
may introduce new problems, requiring you to undertake a 
new security review to match the changed circumstances.
Though you can use the method to review security for a very close 
relative, attempting a review for a total stranger will be almost 
impossible, because you need ‘Constant access to, and a close and 
detailed understanding of, the person and lifestyle of the subject 
of the review’.
UNDERTAKING A SECURITY REVIEW
This book is broken down into chapters and sections, each one 
concentrating on a different aspect of your security.
NOTE: While performing a security review you may identify 
problems that are not security related. Do not ignore them; record 
them and deal with them in due course.
A security review is completed in simple stages. This book will 
teach you how to perform each of these stages.
Stage 1 – Review security
Review an aspect of your security to identify and record 
problems.

10 Chapter 1  · Introduction
Stage 2 – Prioritize problems
Sort and prioritize those problems in order of severity, putting 
those that present the greatest threat to you and your lifestyle 
at the top of the list. You need to concentrate on resolving those 
problems whose resolution will give you the greatest possible 
reward for your efforts, while making best use of your limited 
resources.
Addressing the highest priority problems as soon as possible will 
enable you to make the greatest improvements to your security.
Stage 3 – Define countermeasures
For each problem, identify and define simple, affordable and 
achievable countermeasures that will resolve the problem to 
your satisfaction. You may come up with one or more possible 
countermeasures. If you cannot identify any countermeasures 
seek help and advice.
Stage 4 – Adopt and prioritize 
countermeasures
For each problem, consider the possible countermeasures. Look 
at the options and decide which countermeasure(s) you want to 
introduce. The considerations include:
Benefit – how much will the proposed countermeasure 
improve your security? One that delivers marginal benefits 
should probably be shelved while you concentrate on a 
countermeasure that will deliver greater benefits.
Cost – identify the financial cost of introducing each 
countermeasure. Don’t forget to look for hidden costs; a 

Chapter 1  · Introduction 11
new door may cost £325, but the total cost includes a fitting 
charge of £125, a new lock, letterbox, handles etc. which cost a 
further £75, and repairing plaster and paint around the door 
which will cost a further £55.
Resources – perhaps you can do the work yourself. If not, get 
at least three independent quotes, accepting the quote that 
offers best value. Remember, that may not necessarily be the 
cheapest quote! Factors such as the tradesman’s reputation, 
any personal recommendations you may have, the quality 
of the work proposed, the tradesman’s availability, and more 
should also be considered. Don’t forget your ‘gut feelings’; if 
something seems not quite right about them, use someone 
else.
Degree of risk – you should also consider the level of risk 
you will be taking by not introducing a countermeasure. 
Not fixing the lock on the front door leaves the house totally 
insecure – a major risk which should be considered when you 
are deciding what countermeasures to take.
Stage 5 – Implement
When your review has been made, and you have decided which 
countermeasures to implement, in what order of priority – do it. 
This is the most vital stage of the process, the time when you act to 
protect yourself against the problems you have identified.
PACING YOUR REVIEW
Don’t rush it, but don’t delay unnecessarily. Read this book 
carefully and think about each area discussed. When you fully 

12 Chapter 1  · Introduction
understand it you should have a valuable insight into the way 
apparently inconsequential and innocent acts, omissions and 
decisions could put your security at risk.
Using the information in this book, you will be able to identify 
and prioritize the specific problems that could turn you into 
a victim. More importantly, you will have learned to look at 
every-day situations and be able to identify where new risks and 
threats lie, allowing you to take immediate steps to avoid them. 
You will then be able to make changes to increase your security, 
by continually reviewing your life, identifying and avoiding new 
threats as they occur.
WHAT YOU WILL NEED
To understand and be able to perform an effective security review, 
you need this book, and:
time to read the book and consider the range and type of 
problems discussed, then time to think through and identify 
how any of the issues raised could affect your unique 
lifestyle;
the ability to decide on the relevance to your house and 
lifestyle of the problems discussed, while taking a broader 
view to decide if you are subject to other, more specific and 
unique, threats and risks;

Chapter 1  · Introduction 13
forms, or other means of recording problems as you discover 
them, as well as for assigning appropriate and possible 
countermeasures;
the skill, finances and resources to implement any 
countermeasure that you select.
The skills and knowledge required to perform a security review 
include:
accepting that there are threats and risks all around us;
accepting that some of your activities make you more 
vulnerable, and hence at a greater risk of becoming a victim;
an ability to learn how to identify potential threats and risks 
in ‘your world’;
an ability to learn how to identify possible countermeasures to 
reduce or remove your exposure to those threats and risks;
an ability to remain alert to your surroundings, particularly in 
relation to some of your activities and actions;
an ability to become equally aware of the activities and 
behaviour of the people around you, and to be prepared to 
take action to avoid developing or potential risks.
WHEN TO CARRY OUT YOUR REVIEW
As soon as possible, if you have never performed a security 
review.

14 Chapter 1  · Introduction
During the year you should remain alert to changing circumstances 
and possible new problems, but you should perform a formal 
lifestyle security review at least every 12 months.
If there is a significant change in your life, you should at least 
undertake a partial security review. The more significant the 
change, the more reason there is to perform a complete security 
review! Reasons include:
moving house;
starting a new job;
taking a different mode of transport to work – for example, 
the train instead of driving;
getting married;
having a child;
coming into some money.
IT’S YOUR DECISION!
It is important to remember that this is general advice. Laws 
change and people and their lifestyles differ. Your lifestyle may 
be eccentric or unusual. You may have strange allergies, a love for 
dangerous sports and a pet tiger! Because there is only one ‘you’, 
this book can only raise your level of awareness and offer general 
advice, and you must treat it as such.

Chapter 1  · Introduction 15
You must decide if you want to act on any of this advice.
You must select and implement actions appropriate to you and 
your lifestyle.
You must check with relevant experts to make sure that you do the 
right thing for your circumstances.

Undertaking a House 
Security Review
You may live in a house, flat, maisonette, detached mansion, 
cottage, villa, mobile home or terrace. This chapter explains how 
to review and improve the security of the place where you live; for 
simplicity we’ll call it your ‘house’.
Your house is a critical element in your safety and security for 
many reasons, including the following.
Most people are at home for upwards of ten hours every day.
You expect your house to be safe, so you probably let your 
guard down when you are there.
For around eight hours each day most people are in bed 
asleep, and therefore particularly vulnerable.
You rely on your house to shelter your loved ones and keep 
them safe.
Your house is usually your biggest investment.
You use your house to store all of your possessions, even 
when you are not at home.
16

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 17
Using common sense and knowledge, you can take steps that 
will make your house as safe as it can be without turning it into a 
fortress or a prison.
NOTE: Shared accommodation, student digs, a detached house 
and a tenth-storey flat all present unique problems, but they 
also share some common elements. They all have access points, 
neighbours, doors and windows, approaches and a perimeter. 
Surveying the security of a detached house which has gardens, 
garages, outbuildings and sheds is considerably more complicated 
than surveying a flat because for a flat you can usually ignore 
the process that relates to fences, gardens, sheds and other 
outbuildings.
In this book I will therefore describe the process necessary to 
complete the most complicated review, and that is for a semi-
detached two-storey house with a garden, neighbours, garage, 
greenhouse, shed, easy access via ground-floor doors and 
windows, potential access to first-floor windows, and flat roofs 
etc. In comparison, completing a survey on a tenth-floor flat 
would be easy.
No matter what type of building you call home, when you have 
read and understood each chapter, you should apply the approach 
to your unique accommodation.
When you have learned how to do this, you could also use some 
elements of this security review method to review the security 
of a property you are considering buying or renting. As you 
will not have free access to that property, you will not be able to 

18 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
perform some elements as thoroughly, but you should still get an 
impression of the security of that property.
The following advice will enable you to perform a security review 
in order to address and improve security and reduce threats and 
risks to your house.
RESEARCHING YOUR AREA
Step one in surveying your current house is to research crime 
statistics for the area. This will help you to decide which problems 
are most important and should be addressed first.
When buying a house most people check to see if a motorway is 
being built at the bottom of the garden, but few people check on 
the security aspects of a house. Yet the information you uncover 
may be critical to your decision to buy that house or not.
I have listed a number of sources of information that are available 
to you to start you off. Research is of most value for a property and 
area you are thinking of moving to.
Take a look yourself
Going to take a look yourself is the best option. Local taxi drivers 
are also a good source of information; they quite freely say if they 
think an area is safe after dark, or a somewhere they would like 
to live.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 19
Estate agents
Talk to local estate agents, they know the status of an area. Try an 
open question such as ‘I’m thinking of buying a house in Forest 
Park. What’s that like for crime?’ It’s their job to sell houses, but 
they should be able to tell you what different areas are like. If 
several estate agents tell you it would be safer to move to a war 
zone, look elsewhere.
Local people
Ask around the area, carefully. Local shops and shopkeepers are 
good sources of information. If the shops are fitted with CCTV 
cameras, steel shutters and bullet-proof glass, you know that 
trouble is not very far away!
Talk to shopkeepers and older residents. Don’t ask leading 
questions, try a more neutral approach, such as ‘Has it changed 
much around here?’ That tends to get a more balanced response, 
and gives you an opportunity to nudge the conversation towards 
crime and safety. They may say, ‘It used to be quiet, until that 
nightclub opened. We haven’t had a decent night’s sleep for nearly 
two years.’
What they say is another element of evidence to enable you to 
build your picture of crime levels in the area.
Insurance companies
Insurance companies pay out on claims for crime and damage, so 
they know which areas have a higher crime rate. Ask about crime 
in a given area, or do a comparison. Ask for a quote to insure a 

20 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
house of a similar size and value to your current house but in the 
area you are interested in. If your current insurance premium is 
£295, and a quote for a similar house in the new area is £875, the 
risk must be a lot higher there. Talk to the insurance company or 
agent, and ask why.
Local authorities
Local authority staff are worth talking to. Try dropping into a 
café or pub used by council staff. They know where they have to 
repair damage caused by vandals, where problem families live, 
and where they won’t go alone. Be honest and ask them outright 
for reports about different areas.
Local newspapers
Buy the local newspapers for a few weeks or look through back 
issues in the local library. They carry the sort of information you 
need on muggings, robberies, burglaries, car crime, assaults etc. 
Information from local papers can also give you an idea of crime 
trends; over the years you might see a reduction in vandalism and 
an increase in street robbery and burglary.
Schools
The local school will be aware of trends in youth crime because 
they deal with it on a daily basis. If you have children, you will 
want to know what the schools in the area are like anyway. So 
when you visit them, extend your questioning to crime in the local 
community and their perception of different areas.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 21
Local community police officer
What you would like the local police officer to say is ‘Don’t move 
into that road – the whole family at number 27 are criminals and 
there is a drug dealer living in number 34.’ There are legal issues 
that prevent his being able to speak so openly, but you could try 
talking to the local community police officer. I would be quite 
open and say, ‘I am wondering what the crime is like in that area 
of town because I am thinking of buying a house in Badger Road. 
Would you buy one there?’ If he replies, ‘I would never buy a 
house in Badger Road,’ you can draw your own conclusions from 
that.
Environment agency
In most areas you should check with the environment agency 
to make sure that the house you are looking at is not at risk of 
flooding. On the environment agency website www.environment-
agency.gov.uk you can type in a postcode and check flooding 
maps. This will give you a good idea of the risk of flooding for any 
given location and property.
Internet sources
Various other Internet sources are available for you to make your 
checks as well. Some local authorities and other organizations 
hold information about crime rates and trends. For example,

No matter how good the house looks, the information you have 
uncovered above may make you decide to look elsewhere. You 
went to a great deal of trouble to find this information, so use it!
PERFORMING A HOUSE SECURITY SURVEY
The most important thing you can do if you want to improve the 
security and safety of your house is to perform a security survey 
on your house.
If you are proposing to undertake a security review of your 
own house, go ahead immediately and survey it.
If you are proposing to review security for a house owned by 
a close relative, don’t try it until you have had some practice 
reviewing your own house.
If you are thinking of undertaking a security survey on a 
house you are considering of buying:
x
don’t try it until you have had some practice reviewing 
your own house;
x
accept that you will not have full and free access, so you 
will be unable to perform a full security survey.
CARRYING OUT AN EXTERNAL SECURITY SURVEY
Don’t try to use this method until you have read and understood 
the information in this book. Read each section thoroughly, then 
with a pen handy to record your findings, go ahead.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 23
Your first task is to undertake an external security survey of the 
area around the house, the garden and the close perimeter of the 
house. No matter where you live, the procedure is the same, but 
circumstances may change the content and scope of the external 
survey.
If you live in a 15th-floor flat you probably don’t need to look at 
fences and garden sheds, but there may be other issues to consider, 
such as a cycle cupboard on the landing outside each flat.
The main objective of an external survey is to stand back and 
take a look at the house and the immediate surroundings. Record 
any problems as you identify them, taking a few minutes to 
consider and list any possible countermeasures. The example 
countermeasures listed below will help you to think along the 
right lines, but never forget that you have a unique lifestyle so 
you are the best person to recognize appropriate problems and to 
identify appropriate, justifiable and achievable countermeasures.
Area
Walk around the surrounding roads and make a note of your 
general impression. Is it ‘general light industrial units with some 
residential’, ‘run-down shabby residential’, or maybe ‘affluent 
commuter belt’?
That is the impression that the rest of the world receives when 
they approach your house. With a little consideration this review 
also gives useful pointers in relation to the security of your house. 
For example, though the interpretations are rather stereotyped, 
different appearances could mean different things:

24 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
Industrial could mean lots of people around from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
Mondays to Fridays, but deserted after 6 p.m. and at weekends 
and bank holidays, making life easier for burglars in the quiet 
hours.
Shabby residential could mean a community in decline, with 
high unemployment and no community pride, and where crime 
and vandalism are commonplace. This is only one interpretation 
though – it could just as easily reflect the recent closure of a major 
employer, bad budgetary management and incompetence by the 
local authority, or it could hide an up-and-coming area where 
property values are set to shoot through the roof.
Knowledge of the area and people also gives you an insight. Be 
careful what you say; don’t offend or upset people by asking too 
many questions. Aim to be conversational and wait until later to 
write down what they tell you.
Affluent commuter belt means large, well-kept, expensive houses 
with wealthy residents – but think like a criminal, this could mean 
a lot of valuable possessions, husband away at work 8 a.m. until 6 
p.m. each weekday, wife at home when the Mercedes is there. It’s 
worth checking to see when they come and go. Even the garden 
can be profitable; a ride-on mower may be worth up to £5,000, and 
specimen carp from the pond can cost up to £3,000 each. The large 
and mature garden offers plenty of cover for a burglar. Mr and Mrs 
Big-House probably take at least two holidays a year, which equals 
four weeks when nobody is at home. It’s worth coming back with 
a van for that garden equipment – if anyone asks, ‘We’re taking it 
for service.’ The downside is, it’s probably alarmed!

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 25
New starter homes means young residents starting out on the 
property ladder. Probably both are out at work, though mum 
might be at home with a new baby. Young and trendy, so they 
may have the latest electronic goods and gadgets; could be worth 
breaking in. The downside is that starter homes are packed closely 
together, with small gardens, no mature plants and hedges, so 
criminal activity would be easily heard or spotted.
Rural could mean a mixture: some smaller homes, worth taking 
a look at for money and portable valuables; some large country 
houses packed with antiques. Most large homes have an alarm, 
but some don’t. If an alarm sounds, it will take the police at least 
five minutes to reach the property, which is why they use silent 
alarms. Rural properties often have outbuildings, offering a range 
of easily accessible valuables, from garden machines to vehicles, 
expensive horse tack (e.g. saddles and bridles) to sporting 
equipment (e.g. skis and fishing equipment), and pedigree animals 
to tool-boxes. Little passing traffic and no close neighbours are a 
huge benefit to a burglar.
Look for signal crime as you walk around, look out for vandalism, 
fly-tipping, graffiti, broken glass and other petty crime. This is 
called ‘signal crime’ because it is a signal of criminal activity in 
the area, possible lack of community pride and unwillingness to 
speak out to prevent crime. Generally, where there is visible crime 
there will inevitably be more serious crime that is not apparent to 
a casual observer, and usually crime breeds crime.
Who is around? You should be looking to see who is moving 
around the area. Criminals don’t wear badges or uniforms but you 

26 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
get a feel for the type and numbers of people who move around. 
Just as people mature, communities tend to mature as well.
The pattern of movement on new estates may be that each 
weekday dad leaves for work, then mum and the kids leave to 
go to school, later mum comes home alone and the cycle repeats 
itself in reverse soon after three in the afternoon. Twenty years 
later, with the kids at university, the pattern of movement in 
that community will change radically. Eventually it reaches a 
stage when the residents are all retired and there is no pattern of 
movement. They all come and go as they want to, because they no 
longer have regular commitments to meet.
Checking on who is around at different times will identify periods 
of greater risk to you and your property. In the young community 
your house will be fairly safe between eight-thirty and say ten in 
the morning because there are too many people moving around. 
Criminals don’t want to be seen and reported so they will not 
generally be active during that time.
If you live near the local football stadium you might find that 
there is a peak in crimes after the match on a Saturday, when 
drunken louts spill out of the stadium in unsociably high spirits, 
vandalizing cars and gardens and assaulting people as they move 
towards the railway station to go home.
Drunken louts – countermeasures 1
9Use common sense and avoid the risk. Park your car elsewhere 
on a Saturday, lock your gate, don’t go out when the match 
is finishing and don’t leave anything valuable in the front 
garden.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 27
9If crimes peak after each football match, report it and demand 
that something should be done. Get the local residents 
together and record everything as evidence to support your 
claim. Write to the football club, the local police and local 
authority, copying the complaint to your local MP. Support 
that complaint with a petition from residents and a list of 
evidence.
You may be subjected to regular crime if perhaps you live on a 
route that is used by drunks leaving a poorly managed public 
house at the end of your dead-end street. They all have to pass 
your house to get to and from the pub and at closing time the 
landlord throws them out in high spirits. In such circumstances 
it is common for residents to be plagued by petty crime and 
disturbance almost every evening.
Drunken louts – countermeasures 2
9In those circumstances residents should make a log of all 
incidents and any calls made to the police and their response. 
With a few months’ worth of recorded evidence I would then 
make a formal complaint to the police, the landlord and the 
local licensing authority and copy it all to my MP.
Identifying patterns of movement and the type of people moving 
around at different times will help you to accurately assess threats 
and risks in a given area.
Approaches to your house
A house on a straight road that runs north to south has two 
approaches – from the north and from the south – while a house 

28 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
on a crossroads with a footpath running across the fields behind 
it has multiple approaches. You should check each approach to 
your house.
Walk around and review all approaches to your house to perform 
a thorough security review. For each approach use your ‘criminal’s 
eye’; try to identify any actual or possible vulnerabilities. From 
the bus stop opposite a perspective burglar may get an inviting 
view of your new 50-inch plasma TV, and laptop computer in the 
lounge. Other things to look out for include:
easy entry points and easy exit carrying your valuables;
low or broken fences and any cover offered by shrubs etc;
unlocked sheds containing expensive tools and equipment;
insecure workshops and garages, allowing burglars to take 
an inventory of what they can steal or use to break into your 
house;
expensive statues, specimen carp, mountain bikes and other 
valuables in the garden;
greenhouses with expensive propagators and heaters;
garden tools (spade or fork) that can be used to force a window 
or door;
ladders left outside which will give easy access to roofs and 
windows;
any signs of a dog, or a burglar alarm;

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 29
any signs that the resident is disabled or elderly, such as 
wheelchair ramps and handrails;
any vehicles associated with the premises.
Vehicles can tell us a lot about the residents of a particular 
property. An electrician’s transit van and a Ford Focus parked 
outside a house indicate that the owner is an electrician (he will 
be out Mondays to Fridays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). The van contains 
valuable tools and equipment and there is an interesting-looking 
locked shed or workshop. Mrs Electrician drives the Focus and 
the couple have a baby! As we passed we saw a baby seat in the 
front passenger seat of the Focus, and women’s driving shoes in 
the driver’s foot well.
A burglar can read your property as easily as that. As he passes by 
he will read all of this and more. That is why you have to identify 
and review all approaches to your house, so that you know what 
he can see.
Add complications like a garage forecourt beside a property and 
a public playing field at the rear and the review becomes more 
difficult. No matter what the state of your property, check all 
approaches and make sure you know what is visible.
Is anyone in?
Criminals don’t want to be disturbed or caught, so they prefer to 
carry out their crimes in or on empty premises. If a house looks 
occupied most criminals will walk past and look for an easier 
target. They don’t need to take risks when there are so many more 
vulnerable houses just up the road.

30 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
Your objective is to take as many steps to protect yourself as are 
reasonable and you can justify. With each step, you make your 
house that little bit harder for burglars to target and encourage 
them to move on to easier targets up the road.
At night, if you see a house with no lights on, an open gate and 
garage door with no car visible, it’s pretty certain that the house is 
empty, and an empty house is an easy target. Even without those 
clues, it is amazingly easy to find out if there is anyone at home 
– just knock at the front door!
If nobody answers there is probably nobody at home, so burglars 
can slip around to the back and help themselves. If somebody 
does answer the door, the criminal excuses himself by saying 
something like ‘Does Jack the mechanic live here?’ You say no 
and close the door, and the burglar walks away because there are 
a lot more vulnerable houses down the road.
Helpful neighbours have even unwittingly helped criminals. A 
neighbour saw somebody knocking next door and ‘helpfully’ 
informed the person that ‘Mr and Mrs Jones are in Brighton 
visiting their daughter, they won’t be back until Tuesday.’ Guess 
what Mr and Mrs Jones discovered when they got back on 
Tuesday?
Anyone in – countermeasures
9Tell a friendly and trustworthy neighbour that you are going 
to be away.
9Consider leaving a contact number with them in case of 
problems.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 31
9If you will be away a few days consider leaving the number 
of a nearby relative who will be able to act as key holder if the 
neighbour thinks there is a problem.
Finding your house
How hard is it for the emergency services to find your house, at 
night and in the rain? If there are house numbers in your road, 
it is quite easy, but if your house is identified by a name only, 
it might be very hard to find. To find ‘Woodpeckers’ in Badger 
Road the emergency services may have to drive the length of the 
road, stopping to check the name of every house – if the house 
has a nameplate visible from the road. If the house owner makes 
it difficult by not erecting or maintaining a nameplate, emergency 
response will be delayed.
To check how hard your house is to find, ask somebody who isn’t 
familiar with it to find it at night in the rain. See how long it takes 
them, and don’t cheat by putting all the lights on or standing at 
the front door.
Finding your house – countermeasures
9If possible, ask your neighbours to number houses in the road 
in sequence, making it easy to find each house.
9If houses have names only, ensure that the house names are 
clearly marked, visible and easy to read.
9Get everyone in the road to standardize nameplate styles and 
locations to help identify properties.

32 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
9If you have to call the emergency services, give further 
guidance, such as ‘From Fox Lane, turn into Badger Road; 
“Woodpeckers” is the first house on the right after the wooden 
bus shelter.’
9If emergency services have been called and it is safe to do so, 
send somebody out into the road to attract the attention of 
the driver. Do tell the operator of your intentions, so that this 
information can be passed on to the driver of the emergency 
vehicle, who will then be warned to look out for you.
Front view of your house
At the front gate, stop and take note of what a criminal might see, 
such as:
unlocked or open garages, sheds, greenhouses and other 
outbuildings;
open windows and doors in the main house;
ladders conveniently left out;
flat roofs with easy access to second-floor windows (upper-
floor windows are almost always less secure than ground-
floor windows);
vehicles;
signs of dogs (not welcome);
indications of burglar alarms such as bell boxes or signs;
visible signs of goods worth stealing, such as televisions, 
computers, etc.;

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 33
indications of lifestyle patterns (for example, a works van 
means he is out to work all day, children’s toys could mean 
mum does school or playgroup runs each day).
Below is a ready-made list of simple, effective and free or 
inexpensive countermeasures you can take to increase security, 
based on the examples from the list above.
Front view – countermeasures
9Always lock garages, sheds, greenhouses and other 
outbuildings.
9When you are going out make sure that all windows and 
doors are locked.
9Remove and securely store ladders and other tools and 
equipment that could be stolen or used by criminals.
9Secure access to flat roofs, making sure that second-floor 
windows accessible from flat roofs are as secure as they can 
be.
9Make vehicles as secure as you can. Put the car in the garage 
and shut the doors, even if you are going out later the same 
day. Make it harder for the criminal to ‘read’ your property. 
When you do go out leave some lights on in the house and 
leave a radio tuned to a talk station. Anyone listening will 
hear only voices and, hopefully, will assume people are inside 
talking, so they will move on.
9Put up a ‘beware of the dog’ sign, or leave some dog toys on 
the patio even if you don’t have a dog.

34 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
9If you can afford it, invest in a burglar alarm that is monitored 
24 hours a day. The monitoring service will call the police 
if the alarm is triggered. You can also buy dummy alarm 
boxes and dummy CCTV cameras to try to fool criminals into 
thinking your security is better than it is. However, they may 
fool the opportunist thief, but not career criminals.
9Blinds or curtains at windows will reduce visibility for 
criminals. If they can’t easily see who or what is inside they 
will probably move on.
9You cannot easily hide some lifestyle indicators, such as 
a works van in the drive or the school runs, but you can 
deliberately break patterns sometimes. Leave the van at home 
occasionally and take the car to work if you are training or 
have a day of meetings. Co-operate with other parents so that 
sometimes you all collect each other’s children too, or ask 
Granny or Grandpa to sit at home and be deliberately visible 
while you are out taking or collecting the children.
By removing indications of vulnerability, and introducing as 
many anti-crime measures as you can, you make your house a 
less tempting target, giving the criminal more reason to walk on 
to find an easier target.
Frontal access
Look at frontal access to your house. Criminals have been known 
to bring a removal lorry and clear a house of anything of value, or 
drive up in daylight and load an expensive car on to a breakdown 
truck and drive off with it, claiming they were taking it for repair. 
Reducing access makes any property more secure, but bear in 
mind the following considerations.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 35
Planning consent – check to see what you are allowed to do.
Ease of access – this is needed for genuine visitors, deliveries 
and emergency services.
Aesthetics – even if you get planning permission for a high 
wire fence, will the neighbours object, and will you like living 
in what looks like a prison camp?
Cost – will the cost of the measures you are considering be 
justified by the increase in the levels of security and peace of 
mind you will get from the work?
Value – can you justify the cost of the work against the value 
of the premises? If your cottage is valued at £200,000, is it 
sensible to spend £300,000 making it more secure? You would 
be better off selling up and combining what you get for your 
property with what you were thinking of spending to make 
it secure. That way you can buy a new house that is already 
more secure.
Frontal access – countermeasures
9Erecting fences and locking side gates will deny criminals 
easy access to the rear of your property.
9Locking the gates to the drive will prevent anyone from 
easily taking a vehicle in or out of the premises without your 
permission.
9Siting the pedestrian gate under a street lamp and removing 
bushes and hedges at the front of your property gives passing 
traffic a clear view of activity in the front of your house, 
making it a lot more secure.

36 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
9Depending on the location and conditions of your property, 
consider installing lighting that may be operated by a switch, 
timer or automatically triggered by movement sensors. 
Criminals will not want to be floodlit while they try to attack 
your property.
Boundary lines
Boundary lines may be marked with fences, hedges, walls or, on 
open-plan estates, nothing. Check the boundary of your property, 
noting any problems.
The general rule is to protect the rear of the property with strong 
boundaries. This stops criminals getting in easily, making them 
less likely to target your house.
At the front of your house, do what you can to make intruders 
visible to neighbours and any passing traffic. Your property is 
safer if anyone passing has an uninterrupted view of the front of 
the property, as it makes it less likely that a criminal will try to 
scale the fence or side gate to get to the back.
Some fences and barriers may need planning permission, so check 
before you do anything. You also have a duty of care and should 
not allow or cause harm to anyone on your property, whether 
they are legitimate visitors or not (Occupiers Liability Act 1984).
Walls Brick, block or concrete walls are solid, but they can give 
criminals good foot and hand holds, allowing them to climb 
over safely. Once inside, they are also shielded from the outside 
world, hence the advice to have clear views of the front of your 
property.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 37
Simple walls may stop an opportunist thief, because they want 
to be in and out quickly and easily and a wall or fence will slow 
them down. Expensive burglar alarms, approved and legal anti-
climbing paint and spikes etc. can deter even the dedicated 
burglar.
Wooden fences Prices vary. These are not as strong as a wall, and 
are of variable strength – you get what you pay for. Wooden fences 
may be cheaper than a wall, but they require more maintenance 
effort and they can be climbed. However, a determined criminal 
will simply kick or cut a hole in even the strongest wooden fence.
Wire fences Available in a variety of heights and styles, these 
can be inexpensive. The can be alarmed, but that is an expensive 
option. A wire fence will deter opportunists, especially if it is 
topped with barbed wire. It is possible to scrape a hollow under 
the wire and slide through, so there is an option to have them 
installed with buried ‘aprons’ – concrete footings and stakes set 
into the ground – but that makes them a lot more expensive.
Their ultimate flaw is that anyone with a cheap pair of wire 
cutters hidden in their pocket can get in, and if a vertical slice 
is cut through the wire behind a bush or tree, a hole can remain 
undiscovered for weeks.
Metal railings These are expensive to very expensive. Spiked 
railings are probably the most secure common fencing there is, 
which is why they cost so much. Foundations and aprons block 
easy access underneath. A hacksaw and plenty of time, or a noisy 
and expensive mechanical cutter are needed to cut through 
railings, and a hole in metal railings is usually quite easily 

38 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
spotted. Alarms and sensors can be fitted for added protection as 
an expensive option.
Hedges Natural in appearance, these make the home feel less 
like a prison. Cheap, decorative and ineffective, up to expensive 
and impenetrable, they prevent casual intrusion. The right plants, 
together with correct watering and pruning, will produce a dense 
and almost impenetrable barrier. However, drought and disease 
can destroy a hedge in weeks; fire can destroy it in minutes. An 
intruder with pruning shears can cut a hole in minutes. Hedges 
take months or years to reach maturity. The cost of maintenance 
is high, and the protection offered is variable. Prickly plants offer 
better all-round protection, but you may decide against them if 
you have children.
Open-plan This style is a legal requirement on some properties, 
aesthetically pleasing to many and uncomfortably exposed to 
some. Open-plan became popular in some areas. Boundaries 
may be marked by ‘marker posts’, but there is no barrier between 
properties or between public and private areas. Some deeds and 
tenancy agreements specify that boundaries must be erected and 
maintained, while others specify no boundary. Security against 
intrusion is non-existent, but the open-plan nature does mean 
that a criminal will be totally exposed as they creep around a 
property.
Boundary lines – countermeasures
9Combining some fencing and boundary styles will increase 
security. A chain-link fence with a prickly hedge planted on 
the inside works well. The chain-link fence prevents casual 

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 39
intruders, and the prickly bushes deter more persistent 
intruders. With a combination barrier, the hedge does not 
have to be so expensive or carefully tended, because the 
chain-link fence is the primary barrier. The roots of the hedge 
are an effective barrier to stop intruders digging under the 
fence.
9Insubstantial trellis is an inexpensive countermeasure. 
Putting a trellis on top of an existing fence or wall is a major 
deterrent. It is quite cheap to buy and fairly easy to install. It 
deters intruders because they know that if they try to climb 
over the wall and trellis, the trellis will break, making noise, 
disturbance, and maybe injuring them.
9Add noise-makers. For a modest cost you can add alarms 
or noise-makers to a boundary. Attach some bells, or tins 
containing a handful of gravel, to thin lines and stretch them 
along the barrier. If an intruder tries to climb the wall he will 
pull the line and make a noise. NOTE: ‘traps’ designed and set 
to injure intruders are illegal and using them could put you in 
court or even prison.
9Security patrols. You could pay a security company to patrol 
your property. A variety of services are available at a range of 
costs.
9Cheat. Erect signs saying ‘Beware – Guard Dog’ or ‘Premises 
Patrolled By XYZ Security’. A motivated professional burglar 
may not be put off, but a passing opportunist thief might be.
Gates
Fences almost always have to have at least one gate built into 
them. The fence then becomes as secure as the gate that has been 

40 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
installed. Gates should be more secure than the fence, while being 
simple and convenient for authorized people to unlock them, 
open, use and then secure them again afterwards.
Because a gate is designed to allow access through a barrier, it is a 
weak point in that barrier.
Gates – countermeasures
9Don’t install a gate unless it is absolutely necessary.
9The smaller the opening in the barrier and smaller the gate, 
the more secure the barrier will be.
9Gate posts and frames should be stronger than the 
surrounding fence posts, because they have to take additional 
strain during opening and closing and from knocks while in 
use.
9Hinges should be secured to prevent intruders from simply 
lifting a gate off its hinges.
9Gate locks should be as solid and secure as locks on a door, 
preferably with a two-point locking system to distribute the 
load and stress on the gate and gate post.
Paths
The positioning and construction of footpaths can add to or 
detract from security. Nobody can walk on a gravel path without 
making a noise. Therefore a gravel drive and path surrounding 
your house acts like a mediaeval moat, stopping intruders from 
creeping up to the house.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 41
You don’t have to adopt all possible countermeasures immediately. 
You may keep that information in mind and choose a house with a 
gravel path next time you move, or install one when you remodel 
the garden.
Feel of the property
Now you have finished the external review, what is your feel for 
the property? The following examples illustrate what I mean by 
this.
Open house. A criminal’s delight! Quiet road with no passing 
traffic, windows left open and with a spare front door key under 
the doormat. Family members carelessly, leave the front door 
unlocked and open. Cars are left with valuables in clear sight and 
their keys in the ignition. Gates are open, there are overgrown 
shrubs and bushes in the garden, and broken fences leave a dozen 
ways in and out. Valuables are easily visible from the street, there 
are no pets, no alarm and apparently the occupants have no idea 
of how to protect themselves or their property.
Fortress. Strong secure fences and prickly shrubs. High, locked 
side gates leave no access to the rear. Two German Shepherd dogs 
are loose inside the house and back garden. The house is alarmed, 
with windows and doors clearly protected by professionally 
installed locks. There are gravel paths and drive, with sensor-
operated flood lighting. No valuables are visible from the street. 
This is a house where the residents are obviously security 
conscious.

42 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
If you were a criminal, which house would you target? On a scale 
of ‘open house’ to ‘fortress’, where do you think your property 
stands?
Carry on with your survey, keeping your impression of the 
property in mind. If your house is more open house than fortress, 
criminals will be taking a greater interest in it. You will have to 
work harder to bring it closer to the fortress assessment. Now that 
you have begun to identify them, implement the countermeasures 
as soon as you can, such as locking the ladder away, shutting the 
garage door and closing the house windows.
Back garden
Check the side and back fences. What state are they in, and what’s 
on the other side? Are the fences easy to climb over? Can an 
intruder get into your back garden across fields, allotments or via 
neighbouring gardens?
Are there unruly bushes and wild plants in which a criminal could 
hide unseen? What work needs doing to make the garden a safer 
and more secure environment? Make a note of countermeasures 
you could take.
Back garden – countermeasures
9Repair or replace broken or rotten fences.
9Plant prickly hedges as a secondary barrier.
9Cut down or trim unruly shrubs and bushes to remove hiding 
places that a criminal could use.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 43
9Trim back any overhanging trees that may help a criminal to 
climb over fences.
9Lock away any ladders, tools, planks of wood or anything else 
that a criminal could use to enter your property.
9Consider installing sensor-operated floodlights.
Children’s bikes and toys
The value of children’s bikes and toys left around the house can 
be considerable. No matter what it is, you should not be leaving 
hundreds of pounds’ worth of property unprotected in your 
garden.
Outbuildings
For 
complete 
security, 
you 
should 
review 
and 
secure 
outbuildings.
Garages Assess vulnerability. What is your garage built of? Bricks 
or concrete are quite secure, but wooden planks rot or can be cut 
through or prised off in minutes. Are any windows out of sight 
at the back or in full view of people passing by? Could somebody 
climb through? How secure are the doors? What locks are used 
and with how many locking points? (A three-point locking system 
offers better security.)
Can people see inside? Is there anything worth stealing? Make a 
visual inspection to add up the estimated value of what you can 
see – the total will probably surprise you.

Make a note of any problems you find, with appropriate 
countermeasures.
Sheds Survey sheds as well, estimating the value of the contents, 
and recording details of valuable items.
Greenhouses Even greenhouses can contain valuable equipment, 
or be used to store bikes and other items in winter. Do the same 
checks on the greenhouse.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 45
Outbuildings – countermeasures
9Check construction and maintenance. Locking the door when 
the back wall is rotten is a waste of time. Note any problems 
and countermeasures.
9Always lock all outbuildings.
9Make sure all locks are effective and secure.
9Keep a note of the contents, their value, and details of make, 
model and serial number of each item.
9Mark all valuables with your postcode and house number. If 
you do mark your property, display a ‘Marked Property’ sign 
at the front door of your house and on the shed, greenhouse 
and garage doors.
9A photograph showing a scale in the picture (such as a tape 
measure or ruler) will be of help to identify your property if it 
is lost or stolen.
CARRYING OUT A CLOSE PERIMETER SURVEY
Perform the close perimeter survey when the house is locked and 
secured exactly as you secure it when you go out. Walk around 
the house within about arm’s reach of it, looking at potential 
access points and other problems. Consider the following points 
when you are looking out for problems.
Criminals prefer to use doors, so pay attention to them. 
Check and note their strength, fit and locks. Have keys been 
left inside door locks? If so, breaking the glass will give the 
intruder easy access to that door.

46 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
Drainpipes and service cables may allow intruders to climb in 
through upper-storey windows.
Solid trellis and climbing plants may allow intruders to climb 
to windows, balconies or a flat roof.
Inspect all windows from the outside. Check and note their 
strength, fit and locks. Have window keys been left inside the 
locks? Laminated or wired glass may be beneficial in hidden 
corners.
Check for hidden corners where plants or outbuildings could 
allow an intruder to wait or work unobserved.
Check the state of the brickwork, tiles and cladding; if they 
are badly maintained this could make it easy for a criminal to 
gain access.
Check for any access to flat roof areas, which could in turn 
give easy access to less secure windows on upper floors.
Check for access to first-floor roofs. I once attended a house 
where intruders had climbed from a fence on to the roof of the 
house, lifted a few tiles and dropped into the house through 
the roof! (Fit a lock to the loft door.)
Walk around any outbuildings, including garages and stables 
etc. performing a similar review on them.
Check any exterior lighting. What area does it cover and how 
is it operated? NOTE: in a remote property with no neighbours 
to see intruders, automatic lights offer little benefit other 
than helping an intruder to see what he is doing. Lights are 
generally only effective where people are at home, or where 
neighbours and passing traffic can see any criminal activity.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 47
You may well discover some threats that are not security related, 
such as loose electrical wiring in the greenhouse. Record 
them and deal with them appropriately. Always check for 
landlord or planning permission or other restrictions on your 
countermeasures.
Close perimeter – countermeasures
9Drainpipes and cables. Replace metal pipes with reproduction 
plastic ones as long as your landlord and council will allow 
you to. They are functional, but will not support the weight of 
a climbing intruder.
9Trellis and climbing plants. Make sure that the trellis or 
climbing plants on your walls is too weak to support an 
intruder. Climbing plants damage brickwork anyway and can 
promote and support damp and pests.
9Door and window locks. Are they secure? Without damaging 
them, give them a push or pull. Could you force them if you 
wanted to? Feel for any movement, loose locks or frames, note 
problems and resolve them. Never leave windows open when 
you are out. They are an invitation to burglars.
9Hidden corners. Identify access points that are hidden from 
view. You could fit metal bars on windows in hidden corners, 
or cut back bushes so that they are not hidden.
9Brickwork. Rotten brickwork can make a home vulnerable. It 
has been known for a criminal to be able to chip a hole easily 
in a rotten brick wall to gain access to premises.

48 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
9Flat roof access. A flat roof will give easy access to upper floors. 
Upper-floor windows are often less secure than ground-floor 
windows so make them secure.
9First-floor roof access. Deny access: hide ladders etc., use 
anti-climbing paint, anti-intrusion spikes, install weak plastic 
drainpipes, plant prickly plants around the walls.
9Outbuildings. Secure them to protect valuable contents, and 
prevent access to tools that could be used to break into your 
property.
9Lighting. Consider upgrading, repairing or installing sensor- 
and timer-operated mounted floodlights, but only if the lights 
will display criminal activity to neighbours or passing traffic.
Make a note of any problems, resolving them immediately if you 
can. Lock the ladder away, close the garage door and the utility 
room window (the cat can manage outside for a few hours while 
you are out).
After completing the external survey, while it’s fresh in your 
mind, review the problems and add any additional explanation 
you might need. ‘Cat’ may be all you wrote originally about the 
utility room window; you may need to add something to remind 
you to get everyone to lock it whenever you go out!
A word of warning: your notes would be a gift to any potential 
burglar if they were found, because they list all vulnerabilities in 
your home, so keep them safe.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 49
CARRYING OUT AN INTERNAL SECURITY SURVEY
Now we start looking inside the house. Start at the front door and 
work your way through every room on the ground floor, then all 
other floors, but don’t start until you have read this chapter.
Shared occupancy
In single-occupancy accommodation you can lock up when 
you leave; in shared-occupancy accommodation your control 
is limited. This makes the security risk in shared-occupancy 
accommodation 20 times higher than that in single-occupancy. 
The smaller the private area you control the greater the threat.
Single occupants have total control; they can lock the house 
and nobody should be there when they are out.
Shared occupants share access and security with others, 
hence they have less control and less security.
Students may share kitchen and bathroom, and only have 
a small room they can call their own, meaning that their 
bedroom door is their barrier on the world. Lock it, even 
if you are only going to the toilet; you don’t know who is 
around, staying or visiting!
If you share a room with several people you can guarantee 
security only when you are in the room and awake. 
Alternatively, you can guarantee security of items only if you 
carry them with you.

50 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
Shared occupancy – countermeasures
9Be aware of the problems associated with shared occupancy.
9If you are forced to share insecure accommodation, consider 
the wisdom of buying portable valuables and keeping them in 
your room.
9Consider buying a solid lockable steel cabinet, which you can 
use to store your valuables while you are out of the room.
9Never leave money, credit cards etc. unattended and in view 
– and therefore vulnerable.
9Consider leaving your more valuable property with relatives 
if your accommodation is less than secure. You can retrieve 
your video camera from Aunt Susan if you need it next 
week.
9Make sure that you keep records of the make and serial 
number of each item of your property.
9Foster a security-conscious spirit among fellow residents 
in your area. Encourage them to agree to lock their street 
door, never let anyone in that they don’t recognize and, most 
important, challenge strangers, particularly:
x
anyone who is not recognized by residents;
x
anyone who looks flustered or surprised;
x
anyone carrying or removing anything from neighbours’ 
premises (without proof or corroboration, don’t believe 
anyone who says they are taking the DVD player and 
television or laptop computer for repair).

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 51
Fire
While you are performing your survey, do a fire safety assessment 
as well. Your local fire and rescue staff can help with this, but you 
can make common-sense checks immediately.
Smoke detectors Smoke detectors save lives; if you don’t have 
any, get some installed immediately!
Fire – countermeasures
9If you do have smoke detectors, check their position.
9Change the batteries regularly. I advise you to do this twice a 
year – once on your birthday and once six months later.
9Push the test button at least once each month.
Check for threats Check for fire threats in each room. The fire 
and rescue service can help with leaflets and visits to advise 
you. Paraffin heaters used to be a major risk; overloaded sockets, 
damaged electrical wires and forgotten cooking pans are still 
threats.
About one third of fire-related household deaths in the UK are 
attributed to smoking. Smokers are almost twice as likely as non-
smokers to have a house fire.
Fire threats – countermeasures
9Any device should be plugged into a wall socket that has been 
installed by a qualified electrician.
9Trailing cables, extension leads and adapters are signs that a 
house needs to be rewired – don’t wait too long. (If you are 

52
Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
buying a house, ask when it was last rewired and if necessary 
reduce your offer by the price of rewiring.)
9It is recommended that UK domestic wiring should be 
professionally tested at least every ten years. When was yours 
last tested?
9Faulty electric systems kill; have remedial work done 
immediately.
9No smoking in bedrooms (don’t fall asleep while smoking).
9No smoking in the lounge (discarded cigarettes cause fires in 
furnishings).
9No smoking in the garage (danger of fuel or other flammable 
material igniting).
9Consider asking all smokers to step outside to smoke. It is 
better for your health, the safety of your home, preserving 
your furnishings and decorations.
9Standing rules. Consider establishing standing rules and 
procedures for the home. If every member of the family agrees 
and there is a standard list, everybody can easily comply. The 
following list includes non-fire-related rules.
x
Never leave electrical appliances switched on while they 
are unattended.
x
Never smoke cigarettes in the house.
x
The last person to leave the house must make sure all 
windows and doors are locked.
x
Smoke detectors must never be disconnected, or have 
their batteries removed to be used in portable CD players 
or games consoles or any other electrical appliance.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 53
x
Smoke detector batteries will be replaced on the birth 
date of the head of the household and six months after 
that.
x
Pans will never be left unattended on the oven hob.
x
Valuables and other property will never be left on show 
near windows or in unattended cars.
x
Cars will always be locked when left unattended.
x
Car keys will never be left in an unattended vehicle even 
for a minute.
x
Inform local relatives or close friends if you are going to 
be away from home for more than a day or so.
Practice escapes Escaping from your home in the dark, with 
alarms sounding and smoke beginning to rise, is more traumatic 
than most people realize. It is easy to get disoriented even in your 
own home, so arrange practice evacuations, especially if you have 
children.
If adults only are involved, arrange a realistic practice evacuation. 
Take it in turns to blindfold one resident and assign an escort to 
keep them safe. Turn the blindfolded escapee around a few times 
then declare a fire in a given location, such as the hall or the 
kitchen and see if they can escape. Do this against the clock to 
make it realistic; in a real fire you wouldn’t hang around!
Children’s practice escapes With young children it is more 
difficult. You must maintain their trust in you and their feeling of 
safety within the home. Don’t push too hard and don’t scare them. 
Though you have serious intentions, make it fun; a competition 
and ‘grown-up’ game for younger children. Award them prizes 
for remembering what to do and doing it right.

54 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
Try to ease children into the practice, for example on a day when 
they say they have had a fire drill at school. They know then that 
fire drills have to be carried out sometimes. Ask them how they 
did the drill at school and tell them you want to see how clever 
they are and how quickly they can get out of their own house in a 
fire drill. Give them an easy start by sitting in the lounge, then tell 
them the competition has started and that they must get out and 
stand by the front gate or wherever you define as your meeting 
point. (Nothing is more frightening or disorienting than a building 
on fire. The only easy way of checking that everyone is out is to 
arrange a meeting point outside.)
When you are practising evacuation with your children, offer 
them plenty of praise and support to encourage them. Make 
sure that the children are rewarded with a trip to the cinema or 
their choice of day out – anything that reinforces the exercise as a 
pleasant experience and nothing to be worried about.
When the first exercises have been successfully completed increase 
the complexity. Get them to lie on their beds and then knock on 
the doors and tell them to leave. Over time, with plenty of praise, 
you can make the exercise more difficult and more realistic by 
doing it at night in the dark.
If children misunderstand or make a mistake, never tell them off 
or get angry, just point out where they could do better. Allow them 
to take a turn as the leader and, in consultation with Mum or Dad, 
choose where the ‘fire’ has been discovered and so define the safe 
escape route. Children must be able to get out of the house alone 
if you are not available.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 55
Some key points to remember are:
Evacuations prepare your child and family members for 
real evacuations elsewhere so that they are ready to escape 
when an alarm sounds at home, in the cinema, at the football 
stadium or sports hall.
ALWAYS make sure that everyone knows when there is a 
practice evacuation. Then they know that any other alarm is 
real and they must act accordingly.
Don’t practise too often; the exercise will become stale and 
boring and will lose its impact.
With any evacuation, somebody should know how many 
people are in the building. They should act as leader and 
attend the meeting point outside with a notebook or other 
means of ticking off names to check people are out of the 
building. They should also note other information they can 
give the fire officers, such as ‘Top floor is clear; no sign of fire’ 
or ‘Everyone is out of the building; there is a chip pan fire in 
the kitchen.’
When the fire engines arrive, the leader should be able to brief 
firemen on what happened, giving them any information on 
possible hazards. For example, ‘Everyone is out. I was welding 
my old motorbike and a fire has started. There are welding 
gas cylinders in the garage, and a motorbike with a full fuel 
tank.’
The leader should also make notes on how the evacuation 
went, looking for things that worked well and things that 
didn’t work so well. Take another look at the meeting place; 

56 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
if it is subject to flooding in heavy rain, select a new meeting 
place that will be dry.
Practise the evacuation procedures too. For example:
x
Crouch down low. Smoke and heat rise so, in a fire, the air 
will be clearer lower down. Crawl along the floor towards 
the exit.
x
If necessary, and if it is possible to do so without delaying 
your exit from the building, consider covering your 
mouth and nose with a wet towel.
x
Try to protect young children. In a real fire they may 
become scared and hide under the bed instead of leaving. 
Don’t assume they have left, look for them. (This is where 
practice drills pay dividends.)
x
If necessary, cover all exposed skin with natural materials, 
such as wool blankets; avoid man-made fabrics.
x
Always have slip-on footwear available in your bedroom. 
While evacuating you may be walking through red-hot 
cinders or broken glass.
x
In a burning building, feel the door with the back of your 
hand. If it feels hot there may be an inferno on the other 
side. If the door feels OK, carefully touch the door handle 
with the back of your hand – don’t just grab it. If the door 
is hot and the handle is even hotter, assume there is a fire 
on the other side of the door and find another exit.
Torches Keep a torch with working batteries beside your bed.
Windows The best and safest escape route is out through a door. 
If the stairs are blocked by fire, a window might be your only 

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 57
escape route. Though current regulations require double-glazing 
units to open fully to allow escape through upper-floor windows, 
older units may not meet those regulations. Check the upstairs 
windows, and replace them if you need to.
Doors Though security is our primary consideration, in an 
emergency you need to be able to leave the property quickly. Lock 
your doors but leave a key to hand so that you can find it quickly 
if you need to. Perhaps keep it on a hook near the door at night so 
that you always know where to find it. Release bolts and chains 
so that if you need to you can escape quickly.
Flood
Flooding is a hazard that more UK families are facing. While you 
are reviewing your home security, check with your local authority 
and water supply company. They can usually tell you if your 
house is susceptible to flooding. Include a flooding check on any 
home you are thinking of buying. You can get this information 
from www.environment-agency.gov.uk
Front door
The front door is important because it is usually the access point 
that faces the world and the one that is most used. As you enter, 
check the quality and strength of the door.
Keys hidden outside Keep a spare key with a local relative or 
trusted friend, but don’t leave or hide one outside. No matter how 
clever you think you are with your hiding place, a burglar could 
find it. Don’t give him a key.

58 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
Hidden key – countermeasures
9Don’t hide keys outside.
9If you have to have emergency keys, give one to each of two 
relatives or very close friends who live nearby. Why two? One 
of them might be out when you need your emergency key!
9Make sure that you trust your key holders and anyone 
who lives with them. Mrs Biggin from number 42 may be a 
wonderful lady, but her daughter’s drug addict boyfriend is 
not as trustworthy.
Softwood door Many doors are made of cheap softwoods. They 
have little real strength and one kick will usually break them 
open. Swing the door on its hinges, you will feel the weight of the 
door. Gently try to twist it; how much movement is there? A good 
solid door will feel good and solid.
Door panels Some door designs include a weakness that is well 
known to criminals. Door panels set into the door often have very 
little strength and may be just plywood. One kick and the panel 
flies out, leaving access to a burglar.
Hardwood door A hardwood door is much more secure. If you 
swing it back and forth you will be able to feel the weight.
UPVC (double-glazed) UPVC (plastic) double-glazed doors appear 
to be secure because of their multiple-point locking mechanisms, 
but many suffer from panel weakness and are vulnerable to a 
simple kick. Newer and more expensive doors have steel frames 
built into the carcass of the door which, combined with the 

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 59
multiple-locking-point mechanisms do make them very secure, 
but steel frames are rarely found in older doors.
Door frame The quality and fixing of the door frame are as 
important as the quality of the door. If the frame is weak and 
badly fitted it will give way and the strength of the door is then 
irrelevant. Weaknesses include the following.
The frame is constructed of cheap wood or is rotten.
The frame is secured with the wrong fittings or not enough 
fittings were used.
The structure of the wall to which the frame is secured may 
be substandard.
The frame may be the wrong size for the opening it has been 
used in.
Locks
No matter how strong the door is, it has one fundamental flaw 
and that is that doors are designed and built to swing open easily. 
They should also be able to be locked securely when required and 
that is achieved by fitting quality locks and bolts. The effectiveness 
of the security of any door depends just as much on the quality, 
number, fixing and placement of locks and bolts.
A night latch is convenient because it secures the door and the 
owner only needs to carry a small key to allow them to open and 
close the lock. The night latch usually screws to the surface of 
the door, so offers minimal protection against physical assault. 

60 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
As a single-point fastening, the night latch offers poor protection 
because one solid kick will break the door open.
A two-point locking scheme offers better protection, especially if 
the second locking point uses a 5-lever mortice deadlock (which 
fits inside the door) to British Standard BS3621.
Different locksmiths give different advice as to the type, location 
and fixing of door locks. Technically, the advice will differ 
depending on a number of factors:
the premises in question and what they hold – security for a 
dustbin store will be different from a bank’s;
access to the door. Whether it would be possible for a ram 
raider to drive at the door, or whether it only has pedestrian 
access;
the length of time the door will be exposed to a threat. If a 
night patrol checks the door every 15 minutes, the maximum 
exposure time of that door to a threat will be 15 minutes;
the material used to make the door. Softwood doors are quite 
weak, UPVC with a steel core is very strong, but not as strong 
as a steel vault door;
the skills and experience used to install the door. A good door 
badly installed offers reduced security;
the design and presence of windows. A door fitted with 
louvres is weak. Similarly, glass in or beside a door reduces 
security. Why fit a strong door if any lout with a brick can 
break the window to get in?

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 61
French window/patio door
French windows are probably the most vulnerable door in any 
property. Usually located at the rear of the premises, they allowing 
a criminal to work unobserved and uninterrupted. Patio doors are 
designed to let in light and be easily opened wide to give access 
to the garden. They are often designed more for looks and access 
than for solid security. They can often easily be levered open with 
simple tools, unless the owner has taken steps to secure them.
Door security – countermeasures
9Buy the best door you can afford and can justify for the use 
you have in mind.
9Have the door installed by a skilled tradesman.
9Ensure that the frame is of equal quality and that it is firmly 
and correctly secured to the surrounding masonry.
9Use the best hinges suitable for the application.
9Install hinge bolts, fitted into the hinge edge of the door. They 
reinforce and strengthen the door on the hinge side.
9Use at least a two-point fastening scheme. Your locksmith 
will advise you where to fit the locks, but generally it is 
advised that one lock is fitted approximately two fifths of the 
way down from the top of the door and another just under 
half way up from the bottom. At least one lock should be a 
properly installed mortice lock.
9Always lock the lock when you go out.

62
Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
9For safety reasons DON’T leave the mortice lock locked when 
you are in the house, particularly at night, in case you need to 
get out of the house in a hurry. Use the night latch and leave 
the key in it for easy escape!
9Carefully check any French windows and patio doors. If in 
any doubt get them checked by an expert.
Other door furniture
Depending on their use, doors may need other fixtures and 
fittings, which are collectively known as ‘door furniture’. For 
example:
Letterbox Cutting a hole for a letterbox weakens the structure of 
the door. Criminals often use canes to fish through a letterbox 
to remove car keys and valuables left within reach. If required, a 
letterbox should be fitted by a professional in a door designed to 
have a letterbox. Door manufacturers often recommend locations 
for letterbox slots for specific door designs, so take their advice. 
The letterbox should:
be large enough to accommodate letter and postal deliveries;
be conveniently situated – the postman will not be happy 
with a letter box at the bottom of the door.
Window bars Where windows are fitted beside doors, fitting 
window bars or grilles provides an added deterrent and an extra 
measure of security, but may be unsightly.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 63
Hinge bolts are fitted to and reinforce the hinge side of the door. 
They are fitted at intervals along the hinge edge of the door. I 
usually advise fitting at least three.
Internal door furniture
Other door furniture can be used inside the door, some of which 
is primarily used to increase security and some have secondary 
security benefits. For example:
Mail basket A metal basket fastened to the inside of the letterbox 
catches incoming post, but it also stops burglars from fishing 
through the letterbox with canes to hook car and door keys off 
hall tables. Never keep keys in the hall or near the front or other 
doors.
Letterbox covers Positioned inside a letterbox these will at least 
stop draughts and can prevent rodents and insects from entering 
through a letterbox that is fitted to the bottom of a door. If spring-
loaded, they will hinder visibility and access if a criminal does try 
to hook car keys or anything else through the letterbox.
Draught excluders A draft excluder is a warning sign to me; it tells 
me that the door doesn’t fit properly and is therefore a security 
risk. If you see a draft excluder, check the door thoroughly.
Weather strip A weather strip may also indicate that the door 
does not fit properly so take a closer look.

64 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
Door viewer/spy hole Fitted to a solid door these will allow you 
to see who is outside without opening the door. Once it is fitted, 
try it to see what you can see. Ask somebody to hide to the right 
or left of the door, then check to see if you can see them using the 
door viewer. This will help you to identify any blind spots where 
a potential attacker could hide. Identify and remove blind spots 
by blocking them with trellis. Force visitors to stand where you 
can see them.
Door chains Door chains can be fitted to allow a door to be opened 
a little, without giving easy access to intruders. There are many 
different types of door chain with the same limitations. They have 
to be fitted properly, and they only work if they are used. If you 
have one – use it. (Don’t leave the door chain on at night though, 
make escape easy if you need to leave.)
Notices and signs Notices and signs can be a deterrent, increasing 
security and preventing nuisance. Signs such as ‘We do not buy 
from doorstep salesmen’, ‘No free newspapers or circulars’, ‘Door 
alarmed’, ‘Patrolled by ABC Security’ or ‘CCTV in use’ can deter 
unwanted callers.
Notes Avoid leaving notes on the door. A note saying ‘Gone out 
– all deliveries to number 42’ is a Christmas present to a criminal, 
who now knows the house is empty. Worse still, ‘On holiday – no 
milk until Saturday 27th’ gives the burglar up to two weeks to 
check over your house.
Top and bottom locks Additional security can be obtained by 
fitting bolts at the top and bottom of a door. They make it a lot 

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 65
harder to break down a door, but I question their value if the door 
is already fitted with hinge bolts and a two-point locking system. 
Additional bolts can only be used when you are inside, and you 
don’t want to use them at night while you are in bed, because they 
might block or delay your escape in an emergency.
Windows Windows beside doors can make the hall lighter, but 
glass is fragile. It is far too easy to break glass to gain access so I 
advise against ordering doors with glass panels. Given the choice I 
prefer not to have windows beside doors. Why install a really solid 
and expensive security door, when the window next to it can be 
removed with half a brick. Children could also run into windows 
beside doors and injure themselves.
Windows – countermeasures
9Avoid glass in doors and beside doors.
9If glass is present, consider replacing the door and possibly 
replacing the side windows with more secure options.
9If you have windows in or beside a door, consider fitting metal 
grills to make them more secure. (Remember that a landlord 
may have objections to any of this work and with listed 
buildings it may be a problem.)
Entrance hall
Now you should start reviewing the security of the rooms inside 
your property. Move from room to room, paying particular 
attention to the access points, especially those that connect to 
the world outside. They are the points that could give access to 
criminals if they are insecure.

66 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
The first room is the entrance hall, and that is unique because 
you should already have considered the front door and any alarm 
system separately. Look at the rest of the hall with security in 
mind.
Keys There should be no keys visible or accessible from the front 
door.
Lighting There should be a switch to operate bright external porch 
lights, allowing you to see clearly who is at the door. (If you switch 
on the porch light and it doesn’t work, maybe the bulb has blown 
or maybe a criminal has removed the bulb – keep that door chain 
on!)
Dressing the hall Elderly people may benefit from ‘stage dressing’ 
their hall. If a visitor to the front door sees a headscarf, a coat and 
shoes in the style that an older woman would wear, he can guess 
that perhaps an elderly woman lives there alone. If she dresses 
her hall with the help of younger relatives or items from a charity 
shop she can change what the visitor sees. A strong, used dog lead 
hanging beside the coat indicates a large dog living in the house. 
Football boots, a man’s jacket and baseball cap indicate to a caller 
with less than good intentions, that there may be a younger man 
around somewhere or due back soon. Remember, anything that 
deters a criminal is worthwhile.
Alarm system
Below are questions you should be asking about alarms are.
If you are checking a property you may buy, is there is an 
alarm system? Is it working? How often has it been triggered, 

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 67
and what triggered it? (If it is badly installed or adjusted it 
may be useless.)
If the owner is willing to tell you, ask what points of access are 
covered by the alarm and by what method (contact breaker, 
pressure pads, movement sensors, heat sensors, light beams, 
break-glass detectors etc.). Are all access points covered (that 
new patio door may have been put in since the alarm was 
installed so it isn’t alarmed)?
Is the burglar alarm system monitored by the company who 
supplied it, or does it rely on neighbours calling the police?
Are there any panic buttons? If so, where are they located?
How often is the alarm used – that is, switched on rather 
than left switched off? (Some alarms are so complicated or 
temperamental that people can’t be bothered to use them.)
Who has the key or code needed to turn the alarm off or on? 
Previous owners or tenants had the code, plus any cleaners, 
builders and other workers who may have been given it. 
Children can be careless, allowing people to see or know the 
code. If you are in any doubt, change the code.
Does the system have a record of activating for no apparent 
reason?
Alarm – countermeasures
9A system that is never used is not worth having.
9A system that goes off too often will be ignored by everyone.
9A system that does not cover all access points is not worth 
having.

68 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
9If the alarm sounds, there is a reason. Use extreme caution 
when checking the premises. If there are any signs of criminal 
activity, such as broken glass or open doors, call the police.
9If the alarm sounds and you disturb an intruder, make as 
much noise as you can to scare them away. They will want to 
escape and you shouldn’t try any heroics. Better that they get 
away than you are injured or killed trying to catch them.
9A dummy alarm box will put off opportunists, but it will not 
fool a career criminal.
9Beware of the return visit. Criminals sometimes deliberately 
trigger an alarm then hide. They may do it several times, 
waiting for the owner to decide it is a fault and turn the 
alarm off until the engineer can check it next day. That is 
when criminals come out of hiding and take what they want, 
undisturbed.
Ground-floor rooms
You should now work methodically to check all ground-floor 
rooms in order. In each room pay particular attention to doors, 
windows and skylights in external walls and ceilings because that 
is where intruders might find access.
Ground-floor windows
Check that all ground-floor windows are and can be fully closed 
and locked. Are the keys to window locks in the locks or have 
they been removed and held in a safe place? Check the fit of the 
window; is it loose, does it rattle? Is there any sign of rot in a 
wooden frame? Check the window and frame for stability; is it 
loose or well fitted? Make a note of any problems.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 69
At night leave bedroom windows unlocked. If there is a fire you 
may want to escape using the windows.
Ground-floor doors
As with the front door and ground-floor windows, remember that 
patio doors, back doors, French windows and any other doors on 
the ground floor are most vulnerable to attack. Criminals prefer 
to use doors because it is easier for them to get in and out of your 
house, especially when they are carrying your television and 
laptop computer. Check the fit, quality, locks and stability of all 
ground-floor doors, then note any problems.
Basement
Check security in any basement or cellar you may have. Pay 
particular attention to traditional access points like doors and 
windows, but don’t forget things like coal delivery chutes. Check 
the locks and quality of the door that leads from the house down 
into the basement. Note any problems.
Upper-floor doors
Work your way up to and around each upper floor. Check all 
windows and doors, paying particular attention to doors and 
windows that open on to a flat roof, a balcony or anywhere an 
intruder may have easy access.
Beware of any balcony or flat roof that gives access to adjoining 
properties; they give easy access to your home too. These upper-
floor doors should be made as secure as the front door to any 
property, while still allowing for easy escape in a fire.

70 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
On any balcony, it is worth checking for access routes and hand 
and foot holds from above, below and to the side. Note any 
problems.
Loft/loft conversion
If you have an attic or loft you should check it for security, but be 
careful if you do. Most lofts don’t have floorboards so there is a 
danger that you could fall through into one of the rooms below.
I once performed a security survey on a terrace home to find that 
the dividing walls between lofts were incomplete. It was possible 
to climb through the roof spaces, giving easy access to every 
house in the terrace!
While you are checking the loft, check the quality and security of 
the loft hatch and any windows in the gable end walls or the roof. 
Take time to check for broken tiles, leaking pipes or wasp’s nests, 
the state of the lagging etc. Note any problems and get an expert 
to check them.
KEEPING TRACK OF YOUR HOUSE KEYS
Before you go any further, sit down and make a note of how many 
sets of keys there are to your house and who holds them. When 
you have finished your list, read on.
How many sets of keys have you listed – three, maybe four? You 
think you know how many sets of keys are in circulation, but how 
many could be in circulation?

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 71
Who has a key to your house?
When you buy a house, one or two sets of keys are passed to you 
by the former owner, but most families have more than two sets of 
keys. Therefore, keys to your house are probably still in the hands 
of previous owners.
Some may have been kept for sentimental reasons – ‘our first 
house’ – and previous owners may have given a forgotten set of 
keys to a relative or to the lady who used to clean for them. Maybe 
their plumber has a forgotten set from the time he put in a new 
boiler while they were on holiday five years ago. The nice man 
at number 73 has a garage key from when he used to service the 
car. Young Jason lost his keys at school three times so they are still 
missing. Add six or seven estate agents who have held sets over 
the years, and it all begins to add up.
Now, compare how many sets of keys you thought existed with 
the number of sets that may exist. Improving home security is 
pointless if half the population of the county may have keys 
to your home. If you don’t control keys, you don’t control your 
security. Seriously consider changing the locks. Compared to the 
price of the house and the contents you might lose, that is a cheap 
and sensible option.
How careful are you with your keys?
Control over the number of sets of keys that are in circulation is 
important to maintaining security, but how careful are you with 
your keys?

72 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
Hung on a hook in the kitchen or sitting in a little bowl in the hall 
they may not be safe. We already know that burglars fish keys out 
through letterboxes. Window cleaners have been known to snatch 
sets of keys, have copies cut and then return the originals when 
they come in to rinse a sponge. They then have a duplicate key 
and a list of valuables to sell off to a burglar. All your keys should 
be kept out of sight and out of reach of the door and any visitors 
who are passing through.
Keys – countermeasures
9Locks give you security, keys give you access, so be strict in 
managing and controlling your keys.
9Never leave your keys unattended. Don’t leave them in 
your car ignition while you open the garage door, or in an 
unattended bag while you nip to the toilet. (Handbags and 
cases often also hold something that shows your address, so 
the bag thief gets your keys and your address.)
9Never leave any keys inside windows, on your desk at work, 
in your car – in fact, anywhere that they may be taken or 
copied.
9Don’t put your address or car number on a key tag. Don’t 
make it easy for criminals to make a visit and help themselves 
to your valuables.
9Label your keys with your mobile phone number so that 
if you lose them the finder can call you. DON’T give your 
address – they may be honest, they may not be. Arrange to 
meet the finder at a mutually convenient public place, such as 
the library or a supermarket, take possession of your keys, but 
consider changing all the locks anyway.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 73
9Know how many keys you have cut for any given lock and 
record who has each key.
9Before you issue anyone with a key, ask yourself if they really 
need their own key. If it’s for their convenience don’t weaken 
your security and don’t issue a key; they can wait to be let in 
by somebody else. Minimize the number of people who have 
keys and so have independent access to your home.
9When people such as cleaners or workmen move on keep 
control of their keys. Make sure you get them back and if you 
are in any doubt of their honesty change the locks.
9How many keys do you carry? Most people carry a few that 
they can’t identify. Spring-clean your key ring today. Do you 
really need all the keys you carry? Old keys, keepsakes and 
unknown keys can all be removed from your key ring. The 
shed key can go in a drawer in the kitchen. Put unknown keys 
in a sealed envelope and write ‘unknown keys’ with a date on 
the envelope. A year from now, if they are still unwanted and 
unknown, store them in the back of the garage – just in case.
9Never allow strangers unattended access to your keys.
9Get all key holders to secure their keys and agree to keep 
them safe. If they won’t agree, they don’t get a key!
9Avoid using key racks which are helpfully labelled ‘BMW’, 
‘Garage’, ‘Speedboat’, etc.
9What if you find that a key doesn’t fit any longer? It’s not 
unknown for criminals simply to switch keys. This takes a 
second and the loss may not be noticed for weeks. All you 
know is that you still have three keys on your key ring; 

74 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
you won’t notice the switch if you never use the back door 
key. During that time the thief has free access to your home 
through the back door. If you don’t need it, don’t carry it; and 
if it suddenly doesn’t fit, change the locks.
9If you lose a key, or take over a property, you should change 
the locks to regain control and maintain security.
9When you are managing your keys, keep the number of keys 
to a minimum.
9If your circumstances change, review your register of key 
holders. Make any necessary changes and always consider 
changing the locks if you need to.
9For extra security you can buy a security lock, which means 
that keys can only be cut at specialist security stores, not at 
any old shoe repair shop or market stall.
9Consider issuing one key only and not a set of keys. If you 
have children, only issue them with a single key, either to the 
front or the back door (whichever is easiest and cheapest to 
replace). If that key is lost you will only have to replace one 
lock; if they lost a set of keys you would have to replace all 
locks.
9Make sure no keys are accessible through open windows, 
letterboxes etc. – fit a mail basket internal flap and a brush 
draught excluder as well to prevent ‘fishing’.
9If you have a cleaner, lodger or any other non-family member 
of the household, replace all locks to which they had a key 
when the relationship is terminated.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 75
9Don’t leave house keys in your car. If the car is broken into, 
the criminal has your house keys, and probably your full 
address from documents in the car.
9If your keys were in your car, coat, briefcase or anything else 
that has been stolen, change the locks.
9Never, ever leave house keys with a builder or other 
workmen.
9Never leave keys with estate agents or anyone else. When you 
hand a key to an organization rather than a person, you have 
totally and irrevocably breached your security.
RECORDING THE DETAILS OF YOUR HOUSE
CONTENTS
As part of your security survey, perform a survey of the valuable 
contents. Walk through all your rooms again, making a note of 
valuable contents, particularly things that a thief might take. 
Check in drawers, cupboards, wardrobes, trunks etc., to record 
jewellery, the digital camera in your sock drawer and any other 
valuable item.
Take photographs of each item and record descriptions and 
serial numbers, and mark the items with your post code and 
house number using a UV pen. This list will come in handy 
if you have to report a theft or make an insurance claim. One 
insurance company reported that only 14% of people claiming for 

76 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
stolen property knew the make, model and serial number of the 
item(s) stolen. If you can’t identify it, you are very unlikely to get 
it back.
For a flat screen television you might record:
item description (e.g. flat-screen 42-inch television);
make (e.g. Panasonic);
item model (e.g. Model PS/345-2v);
serial number (e.g. P87-FS8650-7642-22);
unique marks (1 inch ‘x’-shaped scratch above ‘on/off’ 
switch)
other information (for example, if you were recording 
jewellery, a valuation and date given);
whether or not a photograph has been taken;
whether the item is marked with a postcode and, if so, where 
it is marked.
Your ‘valuable contents survey’ will allow you to keep a record 
of your valuables, including a description, make, model, serial 
number, identification marks and reference to any picture or 
video footage you may have. See the example below.

Photographs
Photographs make finding lost or stolen property a lot easier, 
even for something as simple as a bicycle. The value of a picture 
will increase where a size scale such as a (12 inch) 30-cm ruler is 
in shot.
Take photographs from the front, rear and sides of anything that is 
hard to describe (jewellery, antiques, ceramics, artwork etc.). Keep 
the pictures with your ‘valuables list’, and keep the negatives or 
digital image for future use.
Videotape
Videotape film can also be used to show valuables. A tour of your 
house featuring key items is better than describing the contents 
of the home. The tape can also help people in houses with lots 

78 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
of objects to identify/remember what is missing after a raid. The 
video can also help with insurance valuations after a fire or other 
disaster.
Do you tell the criminals what you have
You don’t think you do, but you might! We are still considering 
the house, more specifically what you throw out.
Flat-screen televisions and laptops etc. all come in boxes which 
clearly show their contents. We unpack them then put the box 
out for the dustman/recycling, telling any passing criminal that 
we have just unpacked a brand new computer, DVD player or 
whatever. Don’t advertise it; either take the box to a recycling 
centre yourself or, if you have to put it out for collection, cut the 
box and put the markings on the inside so that nobody can see 
what was in it.
Information theft/identity theft
A sift through the rubbish bin of many houses will produce an 
alarming amount of information, such as:
pay statements/pay slips;
income tax documents;
cash withdrawal receipts;
utility bills;
credit card statements and receipts, showing numbers and 
expiry dates.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 79
Identity theft is a crime that is growing out of control. Check 
before throwing anything out, and shred anything that holds 
personal details of any kind.
Information theft/identity theft – countermeasures
9Destroy any documents that hold personal information. You 
can throw away advertisements or instructions on how to pay 
etc., but first extract anything with personal information on 
and destroy it.
Scissors Snip papers into tiny shreds with your scissors.
Fire If you have space and time, you can have a monthly 
bonfire of personal information. Be safe, make sure that 
papers don’t blow away before they have burned, or stay half 
burned after the fire goes out.
Office shredder Some employers don’t object to staff bringing 
in and shredding the occasional document. Check first, and 
don’t abuse this privilege.
Home Shredder A home cross-cut shredder costing about 
£60 is adequate. CAUTION – if it is abused a shredder can be 
dangerous and shredded paper is a fire hazard.
Security waste-disposal companies Commercial companies 
offer secure shredding services. They are not cheap, and are 
usually only worth considering for domestic use if you are 
sorting out papers before moving or when a relative has died 
etc.
9Don’t give personal information over the telephone (including 
mobiles) unless you are absolutely sure of the identity of the 
person calling.

80 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
9If you really need to give personal details, only do it if you
telephone them and you can confirm their number, for example 
from your bank statement, or from a telephone directory.
9NEVER call people back on numbers they give you to pass 
personal information – you could be phoning a criminal.
9The Internet is just another ‘telephone call’. Criminals try to 
collect personal information via official-looking emails, for 
example fraudoffice@mybank.com but they are quite easy to 
create. Generally, the Internet and emails are not secure.
9A criminal can very easily create an official-looking website 
called WWW.SECURITYyourbank.COM. They entice you to 
log in with free gifts etc. Of course, to prove your identity you 
have to type in your account number, credit card number, 
security code etc., then they are spending your money abroad 
before you realize it is a dummy site. NEVER give personal, 
financial, medical or any other details over the Internet in any 
survey, quiz, competition or other transaction.
9Never trust a mail shot. It may look official, it may explain that 
everybody is switching cards for security reasons. They ask 
you to fill in your account number, expiry dates, security code 
details, confirm your mother’s maiden name etc., and return 
it in the conveniently post paid envelope to Mr C. Riminal, 
Central Processing Centre, PO Box 1554, Crookstown. There 
goes some more of your money!
9Think before you fill in any form. Many organizations issue 
forms, for example, for extended warranty, a quote for a new 
kitchen, etc., and demand unnecessary information such as 

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 81
‘Do you own your own home?’, ‘Do you have a mortgage – if 
so, how much?’ They are just collecting information on you. 
I fill in relevant information and cross out the ‘information 
gathering’ questions. If they demand that information for no 
reason I will take my business elsewhere.
Then the criminals come back!
Criminals know that you will claim off your insurance and 
replace anything that has been stolen, replacing the missing items 
as soon as you can. It is quite common for criminals to wait to give 
you time to replace everything, then they come back, taking all 
the new possessions that you have only just unwrapped.
REPORTING AND FINDING LOST PROPERTY
Many people assume that once stolen they will never see their 
property again. ALWAYS report losses and theft to the police.
When items are reported as stolen or lost, police record details 
of the items on a database that they use to check the details of 
suspect property. If your stolen digital camera, Rolex watch, or 
other valuables come to light and are recorded on the database, 
you will get them back. If the details are not on there, the police 
do not know that they are lost or stolen so they are handed back 
to Billy Burglar.
Apart from the police databases there are a few online databases 
that you can search, for example www.virtualbumblebee.co.uk.

82 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
ISSUES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO YOU
Everybody is unique, so your survey should include additional 
issues that are unique to you or your lifestyle. You may own a 
stable and horses in a field over the road, or you may own a vintage 
car that you keep in a commercial store. Your security audit will 
be compromised if you ignore any of these unique issues relating 
to your house and lifestyle. Take some time to make sure that you 
have identified everything.
Be as thorough and conscientious as possible when completing 
your security review, and keep an open mind as to other issues 
that you should address.
Medical problems
Medical conditions could affect your life, your mobility or even 
the use of your house. For instance, an elderly disabled widow 
may stop using the upper floors of her house because she can no 
longer manage the stairs. The way people live and use their homes 
has a significant impact on their security requirements. In the 
above example the elderly woman may not realize she has been 
burgled for weeks. During your review take all circumstances 
into consideration.
Building work
If you employ builders or decorators, you will have a range of new 
security problems.
They need reasonable access to your home to your home.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 83
They may store valuable materials or tools around the 
property, which could attract criminal interest.
If they erect any scaffold or ladders, they will significantly 
reduce the security of your house.
Building work – countermeasures
9Insist that the workmen provide you with:
x
references as to the quality of their work;
x
references as to their ability to finish work within stated 
time, cost and quality targets;
x
assurances as to the honesty and integrity of their 
employees;
x
proof of insurance that covers you, your family and 
property for any injury, loss or damage caused by their 
own or their employees’ and agents’ oversight, actions, 
negligence, accidental or criminal acts.
9Before accepting bids and quotes, check all references 
supplied.
9Before the workmen arrive remove valuables from areas to 
which they have access.
9Never leave builders or other workers alone in your home, 
and certainly do not give them any keys to the premises.
9Arrange for the work to be done when an adult member of the 
family can be there to supervise them.
9Pay a deposit, but never pay the full cost of a job until it has 
been finished to your satisfaction.

84 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
9Don’t employ workmen who come and knock on your door. 
Without a genuine address you cannot check on them or 
contact them if there is a problem.
House insurance
The first point to remember is that the insurance industry exists to 
make a profit. Broadly speaking, there are two different types of 
household cover, building insurance and contents insurance.
Building insurance You can insure the structure of the building. 
If the house burns down, with appropriate cover the insurance 
company will pay for it to be rebuilt in the same style but 
complying with modern building regulations. Warning: check 
the cover supplied by your insurer. An insurer might specify 
conditions under which they will not cover your property against 
damage. Potential problems include:
flood – insurers may exclude flooding from your insurance 
cover;
subsidence – some areas are prone to subsidence, and in those 
areas the insurance company may exclude or limit cover for 
subsidence;
fire – although they are more often seen abroad, in areas 
where brush fires are a problem, insurers could refuse cover 
unless bushes are cut down, sprinklers and hose outlets are 
installed etc.
Building insurance – countermeasures
9Before buying a property check with the current owner, 
estate agent, local authority and insurance companies to find 

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 85
out if there are any insurance restrictions on the property in 
question.
9Flooding problems:
x
Don’t buy a house that is at risk of flooding.
x
Check the environment agency flood plain maps online 
(see below).
x
Where flooding is possible, minimize your risk. Avoid 
installing expensive equipment on the ground floor. 
Don’t leave your property unattended when there is 
risk of flooding. Always call the flood lines to get an 
update on current flooding risks. See www.environment-
agency.gov.uk
x
When floods are possible:
Move vulnerable babies, people, pets and valuables to 
safety.
Move cars to safety on higher ground.
Unplug electrical equipment and take it upstairs 
(television, video recorder, sounds systems, fridge/
freezer, washing machine etc.).
Take personal possessions and documents upstairs.
Keep an eye on your neighbours. If they don’t seem 
to be doing anything, especially if they are elderly or 
infirm, check that they are there and know there is a 
flood risk.
Dig out your insurance certificate and contact 
numbers, leave them available safe upstairs for easy 
use later.
Be prepared to wait for the all-clear. Make sure you 
have food and bottled water. There may be no power 
so a gas heater and camping cooker may be useful.

86 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
Beware of the fire risk: candles and camping stoves 
are dangerous. Have fire extinguishers handy.
Make sure that you have enough prescription 
medication if you need it.
To prevent back flow during a flood, stuff a sandbag 
into all downstairs toilets and place a weight over 
manhole covers. Put bath, sink and washbasin plugs 
in and weigh them down too. (Back flow is where 
flooding pushes sewage up through toilets, baths and 
sinks.)
If possible, turn off the electricity and gas at the mains 
– and don’t turn it on again until it has been checked 
and approved by a qualified tradesman.
9If there is a restriction on the insurance cover of a property, 
seriously consider if you want to take the risk of buying an 
‘uninsurable’ property.
9If you already own a property with insurance restrictions, find 
out why they were imposed and take steps to reduce the risks 
to the property where you can. For example, if subsidence is 
a problem, don’t extract water from the surrounding land; 
in other words, don’t use borehole pumps, and beware of 
planting large plants that draw moisture from the soil near 
the house.
9If your neighbours redesign their garden, radically changing 
levels and drainage, this will affect you. Discuss the problem 
with them and try to resolve it.
Contents insurance You can insure the contents of your house, 
such as carpets, curtains, clothes, television, washing machine, in 

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 87
fact all of the contents. If the house burns down a ‘contents’ policy 
will pay for replacements for everything that was lost.
Warning: that was a very oversimplified explanation of house 
insurance. Insurance varies so much that you must carefully 
review what insurance you require and need. Make sure your 
insurance cover is appropriate. Common insurance problems 
include:
Inadequate cover – many people find that the insured sum will 
not cover the cost of replacement of all of their possessions. 
Check the level of your cover.
Not new for old – without new for old cover, you only receive 
what the insurance company decides was the current value of 
the damaged item. If your television cost £900 when new five 
years ago, the insurance company may say it was only worth 
£200 when it was lost and that is all they will pay.
Single-item limit – some policies specify a limit to the value of 
single items covered under the policy. If the limit is, say, £750, 
that is the maximum they will pay for any item that was lost. 
You only get £750 for your brand new £1,100 television, and 
you only get £750 for your new £1,300 computer system. If 
your policy specifies a limit, you may lose out if you make a 
claim.
Valuable items not listed – even with a single-item limit, for 
an extra fee some policies offer extra cover on named items. 
Therefore you may be able to cover your 50-inch, £3,000 
plasma television as a listed item. With very valuable items the 
insurance company will almost certainly impose minimum 

88 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
security requirements; if they are not met, the items are not 
covered.
Exemptions – some policies impose exemptions. For example, 
your flat-screen plasma television will be insured only when 
it is in your home. Take it to work at your own risk.
Negligence – insurers can refuse to meet a claim where they 
consider you were negligent. If you went to work and left the 
lights on and the front door open, you may not be able to 
claim if you come home nine hours later and find that your 
property has been stolen.
Contents insurance – countermeasures
9Check the value of the contents of your home to confirm that 
your insurance cover is adequate to replace everything. Move 
from room to room, making a note of the value of items in that 
room. Using broad categories is a good way of getting a ball 
park figure without itemizing everything in each room. Note 
a value of the items in the following categories in each room.
Furnishings – chairs, cushions, cupboard, table, sofa, curtains, 
carpets, rugs, etc.
Electrical – washing machine, TV, DVD player, computer, 
vacuum cleaner, microwave oven, etc.
Clothing – outerwear, underwear, hats, boots and shoes, 
formal wear, leisure wear, etc.
Possessions – watches, make-up, books, briefcase, handbag, 
etc.
Valuables – jewellery, stamp collection, antique clock, medals, 
etc.

Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review 89
9Draw up a list of everything in each room, not forgetting 
those things that are out of sight in the loft, the cellar, and in 
your cupboards and drawers. Don’t count every shirt or pair 
of high heels, just add a category, for example shirts × 20, or 
heels × 12.
After a few days walk through and check again. You may 
remember a few more valuables, like the digital camera 
you loaned to a cousin. When the list is complete assign a 
replacement value (how much it will cost to replace that item 
today) to everything on the list. Then it is easy to add up a 
total replacement value for all your possessions in the house.
When finished compare your calculated replacement value 
with the level of cover specified on your policy. If you 
are concerned make a more detailed valuation, or ask the 
insurance company to increase the level of your cover – try to 
arrange new for old cover.
9Check your pricing list against any single-item price limit. If 
there is a problem, resolve it with the insurance company, and 
get any changes in writing.
9If you have any particularly valuable items, make sure that 
your insurance policy actually covers them.
9Check your policy for any exemptions. Keep limits and 
exemptions in mind when you are arranging replacement 
cover.
9Make your best effort to protect your property; insurers may 
refuse to pay out on claims where they consider you have 
been negligent.

House manual
By law, you now have to provide a Home Information Pack if you 
want to sell your house, but for many years I have promoted the 
use of a ‘House Manual’.
The House Manual is a collection of important information about 
your house that is as useful to you as it will be to anyone who buys 
your home.
Your house manual should be held in a four-ring binder so that 
if sections change they can easily be replaced, or if a section is 
needed in an emergency, it can be taken out and used, then put 
back.
Emergency pages should be laminated, to keep them readable 
even if you do need to take them into the kitchen when the 
washing machine is flooding the ground floor of the house.
I suggest it should contain the following sections, plus any 
information appropriate to you and your lifestyle.
Emergency information This should be held in alphabetic order, 
one entry to a page, and written in large print (making it easy to 
read at three in the morning when a leak has fused all the lights).
It should be laminated for durability, updated as soon as there is 
any change, and include photographs or diagrams where they will 
help, such as locations of water stopcocks, mains power isolation 
switches and fuses.

information, 
in 
alphabetic order, using multiple entries. (Multiple entry means 
you list an entry under all relevant headings to help you find the 
information you want. Under ‘S’ you may insert Splatter & Son, 
decorators; under ‘D’ record the entry as Decorators – Splatter & 
Son, etc., and maybe an entry under ‘P’ for Painters).
Any information you collect can be held in the manual, such 
as details of recommended builders, garden services, car repair 
services, plumber, etc.
Significant dates This section is more like a diary for the house. 
In it you will record any significant events relating to the house.

Unique selling point
The House Manual contains information that is invaluable to a 
new owner and will be a unique selling point for your house. It 
shows the prospective buyer that you have taken care of the house 
and the records relating to it, so you have almost certainly been 
as efficient in ensuring that all work undertaken has been of an 
acceptable quality and standard.

92 Chapter 2  · Undertaking a House Security Review
As well as showing when your guarantees run out, and who to 
call if there is a fault, the manual also contains details of honest 
and trustworthy tradesmen in the area, which is very rare and 
valuable information to most people.

Securing your Home 
while you are Away
Most people take a holiday away from home each year. While you 
are away, your house is unattended and vulnerable.
PLANNING AHEAD FOR SECURITY
In the excitement of planning your holiday remember that you 
should also be making your holiday arrangements with the 
security of your house in mind.
Deliveries
Don’t draw attention to an unoccupied house by making it 
necessary for delivery drivers to leave notes, or worse still 
deliveries on your doorstep.
Deliveries – countermeasures
9Avoid ordering anything that may be delivered while you are 
away.
9If an order may come while you are away, ask for it to be 
delivered direct to a relative or trusted neighbour.
93

94 Chapter 3  · Securing Your Home While You Are Away
9Just in case, ask a friend or neighbour to visit the house to 
check for deliveries.
Notes to tradesmen
Never leave notes on your door, such as ‘Milkman, we are on 
holiday. No milk until 18 August’, or perhaps, ‘On holiday until 
18 August. All deliveries to number 7, please.’ Even a note saying 
‘Gone to shops, back in five minutes’ may be enough to tempt a 
burglar.
Notes to tradesmen – countermeasures
9Arrange matters so that notes aren’t necessary. Don’t leave 
deliveries outstanding and consider cancelling regular 
deliveries while you are away.
9Tell the milkman personally that you don’t want any milk 
until 18 August. Never leave a note outside advertising your 
absence.
9If you are in any doubt about your milkman’s trustworthiness 
don’t cancel the milk. It will cost you a few pounds, but 
things will look normal to any passing burglar, and a trusted 
neighbour or relative can visit daily to take in the milk.
9Arrange for a trusted relative or neighbour to collect mail etc. 
to clear the letterbox.
Junk mail and circulars
Your letterbox and front step are important to maintaining your 
security. Unwanted deliveries like free newspapers, circulars 
and pizza advertisements all get pushed into your letterbox or 

Chapter 3  · Securing Your Home While You Are Away 95
get dumped on the doorstep. This rubbish advertises to anyone 
passing that nobody is at home to clear it away.
Junk mail and circulars – countermeasures
9Arrange for a relative or friend to visit and clear your mail and 
check that there is no unwanted milk each day while you are 
away. Free newspapers can quickly block the letterbox or pile 
up on the doorstep.
9I once saw a house with a dedicated delivery slot for circulars 
and free newspapers. Actually it was a delivery slot next to the 
front door, inside of which was a removable box. Every few 
days the owner removes the box, keeps anything interesting 
and throws the rest straight into the recycling bin.
9To stop most junk mail, try contacting the Mail Preference 
Service. Please see www.mpsonline.org.uk for details and to 
register your desire to be excluded from junk mail postings. 
It doesn’t stop all junk mail but it considerably reduces the 
amount. You need a valid email address to complete the online 
process, and it can take up to four months to have full effect. 
(See www.fpsonline.org.uk to register to be excluded from 
junk fax advertising, and www.tpsonline.org.uk to register to 
be excluded from unsolicited telephone advertising.)
9A similar organization which deals with telephone marketing 
is the Telephone Preference Service. They can be contacted 
on 0845 0700707 or by emailing tps@dma.org.uk. All you 
have to do is register your phone numbers and you should be 
excluded from most UK-based telephone marketing.

96 Chapter 3  · Securing Your Home While You Are Away
Central heating
Winter cold snaps can damage your house while you are away.
Central heating – countermeasures
9Ensure that your central heating has been properly serviced, 
and maintained. If this is the case you can be pretty sure 
that it will not develop a fault and cause any problem. Your 
visiting friend or relative can do a quick walk through each 
day to check this.
9In winter, consider leaving your central heating on at a low 
level to prevent the pipes from freezing. This will also keep 
the house dry and warm for your return.
Lights on timers
When you are away, try to make your house look as occupied 
and lived in as possible. Anything you can do to make it look 
as if somebody is at home will be an extra deterrent to passing 
criminals.
Timers that plug into electrical sockets and allow you to operate 
lights etc. at pre-set times are readily available. You can easily 
make lights go on and go off at times that match your normal 
pattern of activity.
The better electrical timers have a battery backup function so that 
they will keep working at the pre-set times even if there has been 
a power cut at some stage.

Chapter 3  · Securing Your Home While You Are Away 97
Lights on timers – countermeasures
9Only buy safe and approved electrical timers, that will not 
cause a fire while they are left unattended.
9Use timers sparingly; don’t make your house look like seaside 
illuminations with all sorts of things switching on and off at 
different times.
9Make sure that you have some table or standard lamps that 
can be operated by the timers.
9Timer lights look better if you arrange for a relative or trusted 
neighbour to visit the house to draw curtains in the evening 
and open them in the morning.
9Use timers strategically, and plan their use. Use them to follow 
your lifestyle pattern. If you get up at six each morning, have 
a bedroom light that comes on at six. If you sit in the lounge 
from five until ten in the evenings, then go to bed, use timers 
to operate lights to indicate that pattern of movement.
Radio talk stations
Lights give the illusion of occupancy, and leaving a radio on 
should help with that illusion. Put the radio on a timer switch and 
tune it to a talk station. Music stations are OK, but if intruders 
outside hear ‘people’ talking, they will look for an easier and safer 
target down the road.
Radio talk station – countermeasures
9Buy or keep a timer switch to operate the radio.
9Tune the radio to a station that you know will be all talk such 
as a news and current affairs discussion channel.

98 Chapter 3  · Securing Your Home While You Are Away
9Tune the radio accurately, a crackling badly tuned hissing 
station will not fool anyone.
9Set the volume to a subdued conversational level. If it is set too 
loud people will realize it is the radio.
The garden
An uncut and overgrown lawn, or wilting hanging baskets and 
weeds invading your usually immaculate flowerbeds all tell the 
criminal that you are not at home. If you always trim the hedge on 
Sunday, then suddenly leave it for two weeks in August, criminals 
will draw their own conclusions.
Garden-based evidence alone can point to a family on holiday. 
Add the lack of activity in the house, the milkman doesn’t deliver, 
no children are playing in the garden, and you begin to see that 
it is quite difficult to hide your absence. It might take people a 
few days to notice, but the evidence builds up to a point where 
everyone realizes you are away.
Garden – countermeasures
9Water hanging baskets and borders before you go away so 
that they don’t wilt and die.
9Cut the lawn, trim the hedge hard and weed the borders.
9Give the lawn and hedge an extra trim, the day before you go. 
Pull out the weeds and water the garden thoroughly to delay 
the unkempt appearance.
9Arrange for a friend or relative to enter the house and make 
it look lived in for a few hours every now and then. I know a 

Chapter 3  · Securing Your Home While You Are Away 99
lady who arranges for her neighbour to visit a couple of times 
a week to tend to the house plants, then to watch television for 
a few hours, so that people can see activity in the house.
9If you have children, you may ask your visiting friend or 
relative to move a few odd toys around in the garden. They 
should do this while watering the garden or mowing the 
grass to make it look innocent. If you leave the children’s bikes 
and toys outside in one place for a couple of weeks this may 
be noticed. Moving them makes the place look lived in. (Don’t 
leave expensive toys/bikes outside. ‘Dress’ your garden with 
older, less valuable items.)
9Check that sheds and garages are locked, cars are in garages 
with secondary security devices fitted.
9Make sure that all ladders, tools and any equipment that 
could be stolen or used to break into your home are securely 
locked away.
Dustbin/rubbish collection
Don’t forget the dustman. In your first week away you will have 
rubbish in your bin. Don’t leave your bin out in the street ready 
for emptying, before you go away. It could remain there for the 
full two weeks of your holiday, advertising to everyone that you 
are away.
Dustbin/visiting friend or relative – countermeasures
9Make things appear as normal as possible to passing criminals, 
including asking a friendly neighbour or relative to put your 
bin out and take it in as usual. (You could offer to do the same 
for your neighbours/friends when they are away.)

100 Chapter 3  · Securing Your Home While You Are Away
9Your relative or neighbour should visit your house every 
day to take junk mail off the step, look after the garden and 
generally make the house appear to be in use.
9Ideally, your friend or relative should spend an hour or so at 
your house, following the normal pattern of your family. The 
dustbin should be put out and taken in, following your normal 
pattern as closely as possible. If it is usually put out the night 
before, then the neighbour should do the same while you are 
away. If it is emptied and taken in about mid afternoon, then 
try to arrange that your neighbour does the same, to maintain 
a normal appearance. Just like milk piled up on a doorstep, or 
mail overflowing from a letterbox, an empty dustbin left out 
overnight is a clear sign that nobody is at home. A burglar will 
soon notice that and investigate further.
Don’t give information away
You have made your house and property as secure as you can and 
your car is locked away and secure in the garage. Will you damage 
your security by telling the local criminals that you will be on a 
beach in Barbados for a couple of weeks? OK, you say you won’t, 
but are you sure?
Can you trust everyone who knows you are going on holiday, and 
the people they will tell? Take a moment to consider how many 
people may know about your proposed holiday plans.
You told the milkman when you cancelled the milk, he was 
impressed and told everyone at the depot and some of them 
told their friends and family (total 45 strangers know).

Chapter 3  · Securing Your Home While You Are Away 101
You told the newsagent so their staff and families know. 
While you told the newsagent there were three other people 
in the shop at the time and they all told their friends and 
family (total 75).
The travel agent and staff know, of course, plus anyone they 
told and anyone else who was in the shop at the time (total 
100).
The bank employees know, from when you ordered your US 
dollars (total 130).
The doctor and his staff know, from when you asked about 
vaccinations (total 155).
Everyone where you work knows, plus at least a few customers 
and suppliers (total 220).
Everyone at the local pub and anyone they speak to now 
know (total 260).
Everyone at Ace Taxis knows, and they even know the dates, 
times and flight numbers of your departure and return (total 
295).
So, without too much trouble we have identified at least a couple 
of hundred people who could know that you will be out of the 
country for two weeks, from the 14th. Are you happy with that?
It is incredibly easy for information about your holiday absence to 
get into the wrong hands, but what can you do about it?

102 Chapter 3  · Securing Your Home While You Are Away
Information – countermeasures
9Limit the number of people who know about your holiday. 
There will be plenty of boasting time when you come back, 
with loads of holiday snaps and that tasteful straw donkey!
9If possible, ask a relative to take you to the airport and collect 
you on your return, then you won’t have to tell any taxi 
drivers.
9If you use a taxi, don’t tell them how long you will be gone. Use 
a different taxi company to collect you on your return. That 
way nobody knows how long you will be away, Alternatively, 
ask a relative to book your return taxi a day or so ahead, to 
protect the information.
9I talk to taxi drivers about the weather and traffic, and avoid 
talking about my plans. They may just be talkative or they 
may be pumping me for details that I don’t really want them 
to have.
9Consider doing some acting! Don’t go over the top, but make 
the taxi driver think there is somebody still at home when you 
leave. Just as the driver is moving off and can’t pay too much 
attention to the house, wave at your house and say something 
like, ‘Gosh, I didn’t think Frank was ever going to let us go.’
Do and say just enough to make the taxi driver think that 
there is somebody still living in your house. 
9Don’t put your home address on your outbound luggage 
tickets. Anyone at the airport can see that you are going 
abroad so burglars can treat the departure lounge as a pick-
and-mix burglary counter. Criminals can read you! Expensive 

Chapter 3  · Securing Your Home While You Are Away 103
luggage, booked on the scheduled flight to Barbados, home in 
the posh district of Commuterville – it won’t take them long 
to spot the worthwhile targets.
9Have two luggage tickets, the outward ticket showing your 
holiday hotel address, and the ticket you put on before coming 
home again, showing your home address.
House-sitters
Pets have to be considered when you are taking a holiday. Some 
people can afford to pay for boarding kennels, others have the 
double benefit of a house-sitter who takes care of their house and 
their pets. You must be sure that any house-sitter is trustworthy 
and will maintain security while you are away.
House-sitters – countermeasures
9A house will be a lot more secure while you are away if 
somebody trustworthy is living there.
9You can hire a house-sitter, but I would only ask a trusted 
relative to be a house-sitter.
9If you have pets, a house/pet-sitter can be a good idea. Getting 
a young relative from another part of the country to do it gives 
them a cheap holiday, you avoid paying expensive kennel 
fees, your pet stays in familiar surroundings, and your house 
is occupied and protected.
9Train your house-sitter to maintain security, to set the alarm, 
to work the exterior floodlights etc.

104 Chapter 3  · Securing Your Home While You Are Away
Create an illusion of activity
If your house is left empty, do anything to add to the illusion of 
life and activity. Use some of my examples or add a few illusions 
of your own.
Illusion of activity – countermeasures
9Possibly invite neighbours to park a car in your drive or 
outside your house occasionally, to increase the illusion of 
activity.
9If it is safe and appropriate, arrange for neighbours children 
to play in your garden occasionally, or ask your visiting 
gardener, or your visiting relative who collects mail and 
checks the house, to bring their children with them to boost 
the illusion of occupancy.
9You could try carefully rationed acting again. Maybe, when he 
is leaving, your gardener could stand at the gate and return 
an ‘answer’ to an imaginary occupant of the house: ‘I’ll check 
to see if I can get a couple of those roses. See you next week.’ 
Keep it low key and only try it once while you are away.
Careful departure
Think security in everything you do. It is pointless taking security 
measures to make people think you are still at home, if you make 
so much noise and fuss about leaving that half the county can’t 
help knowing that you have just left for the airport with three 
large suitcases.
Leave quietly and, if possible, get a relative to reverse up your 
drive to your door and slip the cases into the boot with as few 

Chapter 3  · Securing Your Home While You Are Away 105
people seeing them as possible. If you are going by taxi, arrange 
to leave at a quiet time of day; don’t go at rush hour when half the 
town will see you loading your cases into the car.
General holiday security advice
For your peace of mind, if nothing else, define a routine for closing 
the house before you leave. At the airport, or sitting in Aztec ruins 
in the Andes, you don’t want to be worrying about whether you 
put the cat out, or if anyone actually shut the back door when 
Uncle George took you to the airport.
Define a procedure, list or method that will take you from room to 
room, to secure the house, switch on the electric timers, close the 
bedroom windows, lock the side gate etc.
General holiday security advice – countermeasures
9Pay particular attention to securing the house when you are 
leaving for more than a few hours, particularly when you are 
going on holiday.
9If a friend or relative will be checking your house make sure 
that they know how to secure the house properly. I attended 
a burgled house where the burglar had entered through 
an unlocked rear door. While visiting to check the house, 
a neighbour had been unable to lock the door so had left it 
open. The owner hadn’t explained the ‘knack’ of locking that 
particular door. Worse still, the insurance company refused to 
pay out because the house was insecure.

106 Chapter 3  · Securing Your Home While You Are Away
Long holidays and business trips
You can cover absences on holidays that last a couple of weeks, 
but longer holidays and business trips present some unique 
problems.
I attended a detached house set in large gardens that had been 
burgled and heavily vandalized. The owners were on a six-month 
business trip to the USA. Though they had done what they could 
to disguise their absence, they hadn’t planned for the problems a 
longer absence would cause.
After a couple of months, louts realized the house was unoccupied. 
They broke in, stole some property and stayed to trash the place. 
Toilets and basins were broken, taps were left on, paint thrown 
around and doors ripped off their hinges. The final bill for 
damage and loss ran to thousands of pounds.
From the road outside the signs and evidence that the house was 
empty were clear and easy to see.
Tall weeds were growing through the drive and around the 
gates, making it clear the drive and gates were not being 
used.
Bushes in the front garden had grown quickly, partly blocking 
the front path, the lounge windows and the front doorstep.
Ivy on the side of the house had started growing across the 
living room window at the front of the house.
A telephone directory had been delivered and left on the front 
doorstep, but rain had begun to turn it into paper mulch.

Chapter 3  · Securing Your Home While You Are Away 107
The front windows, front door and doorstep were all dirty 
and dusty, a clear sign that nobody was there.
Overall the impression was of an unloved and unused house, and 
the yobs spotted it and took advantage of it.
Long holidays and business trips – countermeasures
Take time to identify vulnerabilities unique to your house, then 
take steps to overcome them.
9If you are going away for more than a couple of weeks you 
MUST have somebody trustworthy looking after your house, 
performing checks and maintenance duties.
9Check your house insurance, some policies are void if the 
house is empty for more than a specified number of weeks.
9Plan around the season during which you will be absent and 
take steps to overcome any problems.
x
In spring – plants put on a spurt of growth. Arrange for 
somebody to keep the garden tidy.
x
In summer – drought kills plants, and wasps and other 
pests build nests and take properties over. Arrange for 
somebody to be watching for these problems and dealing 
with them.
x
In autumn – falling leaves are the biggest problem, 
especially if your garden is usually immaculate. Add a 
little wind and leaves will collect in sheltered corners, 
showing that nobody is coming and going, and even 
causing a fire hazard. Make sure they are raked up and 
disposed of.

108 Chapter 3  · Securing Your Home While You Are Away
x
In winter – the lack of tyre tracks and footprints in frost 
and snow clearly shows that there is no activity in a 
house. Arrange for the person visiting your house to drive 
in and make tyre tracks, clear the path of snow and, after 
fresh snow, walk up and down the paths to make it look 
as though there is some life at the house.
x
Ask your visiting friend or relative to open and close the 
gates, shed and garage doors. This sweeps leaves and 
snow aside, showing that the doors and gates are in use.
9Ask the person looking after your house to sweep the path 
and drive. This will take some time but will show activity and 
occupation in a number of ways.
9Ask them to keep the windows and the front door and 
doorstep clean to maintain the lived-in look. Remember, all a 
criminal has to do to see if anyone is at home is to walk up to 
the front door and ring the bell. Don’t give him an excuse or 
reason to try that.
9In the summer and autumn, ask the person looking after your 
home to check any fruit or vegetables growing in the garden. 
Easily visible ripening and uncollected fruit is suspicious, so 
tell them to take it and use it with your blessing.
9At Christmas, you might ask them to put up a few decorations 
so that they can be seen through the front window. Nothing 
elaborate, just enough to indicate a family at home over 
Christmas. Just as importantly, they must be taken down at 
the right time too!
9Increasingly, properties need protection at Halloween. 
British louts’ approach to ‘trick or treating’ is more akin to 

Chapter 3  · Securing Your Home While You Are Away 109
blackmail than childish fun. I have seen windows broken, 
cars vandalized and paint thrown over a front door. If you 
will be away during Hallowe’en arrange for somebody to stay 
in your house and distribute a few pounds’ worth of chocolate 
and fizzy drink cans to avoid trouble.
9Plan to avoid known local problems, such as annual pop 
festivals or other events that attract large crowds. If there 
is such a local event, if you can’t be at home to protect your 
property, arrange for somebody to be there to protect it for 
you!

Everybody has neighbours. They may be inches away behind a 
party wall, above you in another concrete box council flat, or in 
the next country mansion three miles away.
Neighbours can be families, occupants of office blocks or factories, 
or they may simply be churchyards, motorway junctions, a cinema 
or any other premises.
BUILDING GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH
NEIGHBOURS
Neighbours can easily have impact or influence on your security. 
A semi-detached house that has a 24-hour petrol station as an 
immediate neighbour may suffer constant noise and give strangers 
an excuse to be near your house, but they also have staff and 
customers around 24 hours a day watching over their property. 
So a neighbour can be a security threat but have security benefits 
as well.

Chapter 4  · Getting On With Your Neighbours 111
If there is a badly managed public house at the end of a dead-end 
road, rowdy and drunken customers coming and going increase 
the security problems for every house in that road.
From neighbourly concern for people living close by, to more 
formalized community watch systems, neighbours have co-
operated to improve security in an area. However, for this to 
work, you must be on good terms with your neighbours.
Some people never speak to their neighbours and don’t even 
know their names. This may be because of a reluctance to be nosy, 
or because people are scared to get involved. The result is the 
same though: people just don’t talk to each other.
Local authorities plan to spend millions on ‘Community Cohesion’, 
in the hope that it will build community spirit and reduce crime 
and disorder. I think they will fail. Community cohesion will only 
work if it blooms naturally within the communities themselves. It 
cannot be imposed by government decree. When people realize 
that they will benefit from any investment they make in their 
community they will make the effort, but only if they see that 
they will be welcomed and that there is a benefit to them!
The obvious benefit is greater security, so take the time to make 
contact with your neighbours. Expect nothing other than building 
relationships that will reward you in many ways.
Helpful neighbours
Living next door to the 24-hour petrol station, think of the staff 
as 24-hour security guards. They don’t know you but over time 

112 Chapter 4  · Getting On With Your Neighbours
a friendly nod will turn into a greeting; this will become a short 
conversation, and before you know it you will be on friendly 
terms with them.
When you know each other they will be more willing to report 
seeing youths climb over your back fence, and you would call 
them to report kids on their storeroom roof. The same goes for 
any other neighbours, whether they are office workers, shop 
workers, school teachers and caretakers, or maybe just Mrs and 
Mrs Biggins from number 42.
KEEPING THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION OPEN
Thousands of people have allowed relationships with their 
neighbours to deteriorate to a level where they end up in civil or 
criminal courts. It’s not usually a deliberate act, it just seems to 
‘happen’. A nugget of resentment can quickly fester and grow into 
a major conflict, and the longer it is left the worse it will get.
As a police officer I was once called to a ‘domestic dispute’. On 
arrival we found two men rolling around on the front lawn 
fighting like schoolboys. One was about 35, the other had taken 
early retirement. We separated them. I spoke to them both 
separately to find out what it was all about.
The young man said that he and his wife and son were trying 
to have a quiet life. It was being ruined by the retired guy who 
was a miserable old devil, a killjoy who hated kids and wasn’t 
happy unless he was complaining about something.

Chapter 4  · Getting On With Your Neighbours 113
The older man said the young family were anti-social, the 
young guy was a lout who didn’t care about anyone other 
than himself, he and his yob son were selfish and had no 
consideration for anyone but themselves.
Two strong and rather different views, but each of them was 100% 
sure that he was right. I asked further questions and identified the 
truth, a simple misunderstanding that could have been quickly 
resolved if they had actually talked to each other.
As they wouldn’t resolve their dispute sensibly, and as I was 
unable to waste more time, I arrested both men and placed them 
in the back of the police van. I sat with them, while my colleague 
separated the wives, who were now arguing and blaming each 
other for the arrest of their husbands. I could see both viewpoints 
but it was frustrating that this was all so ridiculous, and even 
worse because it had been brewing for at least seven months!
In the back of the van I told both men to grow up and shut up 
while I explained what was going to happen, in terms of cells and 
court appearances – that silenced them. Then I told them to listen 
as I related the problem as I saw it. This is what I told them.
When he was young the older man had helped his father grow and show 
flowers in competitions. His father died of cancer and the older man had 
gone into industrial work, where he worked long hours for low pay, living 
in a city centre flat with no garden. All his life he had wanted a garden so 
that he could again grow prize-winning flowers. He became ill and was 
forced to give up work, and the council moved him and his wife to a house 
with a small garden. When the younger family moved in next door, their 
son began ‘carelessly’ kicking balls around, damaging plants in the old 

114 Chapter 4  · Getting On With Your Neighbours
man’s garden. Complaints were ignored and the older man thought the 
boy’s father was encouraging the boy to break plants. The situation came to 
a head when prize competition blooms were snapped off by a stray football. 
Not wanting to ask for the return of the ball, and taking a combative lead 
from his father, the boy had climbed the fence separating the gardens and 
retrieved his own ball, trampling more plants. The older man had seen this 
and was naturally upset. This was the direct cause of the confrontation and 
fight between the two men on the front garden lawn.
Having heard all of that, the younger man looked a little sheepish, 
and the older man looked triumphant. They both started talking 
but I told them both again to shut up and listen, then I carried 
on.
The younger man’s son had fairly severe learning difficulties. Though he 
looked about 12 years old, he had the mind of a child of six. Where they 
used to live the boy had been picked on, bullied and abused, making his 
parents desperate to protect him. The council had moved the family to their 
current house, in a nice quiet neighbourhood where they hoped for a new 
start and a happy life for their son. Their peace didn’t last long when the 
cranky old guy from next door began to complain endlessly about balls and 
flowers. The young guy thought the old guy next door was deliberately 
picking on his disabled son, because he was different!
When I had finished it was time for the older guy to look sheepish. 
He managed to say ‘I didn’t know’, then went quiet.
I de-arrested both of them, and told them that now they had taken 
the time to explain their grievances and listen to the other side, 
they both understood what was causing the problems. I asked 

Chapter 4  · Getting On With Your Neighbours 115
them to shake hands, which they did quite readily, then I told 
them if I was called back they would be arrested again but this 
time they would be taken straight to custody and the courts. They 
left the van apologizing to each other, lines of communication 
wide open.
A few weeks later I dropped in to see how things were. The families 
were now best of friends; the boy had taken to the old guy, who 
was showing him how to grow flowers. The boy had a natural 
flair for gardening, and growing the blooms he now understood 
why he should keep his ball off the flowers to prevent damage to 
them. If they had only taken time to talk in the first place, there 
would have been no fight and they could have avoided months of 
misery.
There are several routes that neighbours’ disputes can take.
Solicitors
If a neighbours’ dispute has reached the stage of involving 
solicitors it has been out of control for a long time. Consulting a 
solicitor will quickly achieve four things:
1. 
It will help to make solicitors on both sides rich.
2. It will escalate your dispute to a new level of bitterness and 
distress.
3. 
It will complicate your dispute beyond recognition.
4. 
Nobody will actually be happy when it is resolved.
If you have a problem, resolve it amicably yourself.

116 Chapter 4  · Getting On With Your Neighbours
‘Friendly’ dispute resolution
Disputes are almost always based on lack of information, 
misunderstanding and a breakdown of communications. (In some 
cases, drug or drink problems and mental disorders cause or allow 
people to do things that are deliberately intended to aggravate 
neighbours. These cases are quite rare.)
If a dispute or problem seems to be surfacing, talk it through with 
your neighbours as soon as you can, the earlier you address the 
problem, the smaller it is and the easier it will be to resolve it.
Talk to your neighbours
You should be talking to your neighbours, even if you only ask 
if they have seen the postman yet, or complain together about 
the weather. You don’t have to adopt an open-door, ‘drop in 
whenever you want’ approach, you can maintain your privacy 
and independence if you want to. Either way, build relationships 
that involve as much contact as you all want.
We should automatically and naturally build relationships with 
the people we come into contact with, whether that is ‘best friends’ 
with the couple next door or just a nodding, first names contact 
across the fence or supermarket trolley when you see them.
By ignoring opportunities to say hello, you might feel you are 
simply avoiding getting too closely involved; they may assume 
you are deliberately snubbing them. Something as simple as that 
could plant the seeds of a nasty dispute that could make life a 
misery for you all. Say hello, offer to cut the lawn while they are 
on holiday and keep a watch on their house; it’s as easy as that!

Chapter 4  · Getting On With Your Neighbours 117
Simple courtesy with a touch of human warmth and natural 
concern will keep communications lines open. This makes things 
easier should you need to discuss a developing problem.
RESOLVING DISPUTES WITH YOUR NEIGHBOURS
Every case is different and most people want a quiet life. The 
following steps should help you to resolve a dispute under normal 
circumstances. If you are the unlucky one in a million who does 
live next door to a drug-crazed homicidal maniac try the steps if 
it is safe.
Step 1 – discuss the problem
You should already at least be on speaking terms with your 
neighbour. Be diplomatic when you approach them, avoid 
accusations and blame, just ask if you can talk to them about 
something.
Invite them in for tea, be friendly and explain what the problem 
is in calm terms. Introduce the subject. Using the flower example 
above, you might show off your flower show trophies, letting the 
neighbour know how important the flowers are to you.
Don’t dive in for the kill, give your neighbour a chance to boast 
about his motorbike or whatever he likes. You want them to feel 
you are chatting when you raise the issue, not that your neighbour 
is a suspect being interrogated.

118 Chapter 4  · Getting On With Your Neighbours
You are both relaxed, so now raise the issue gently. No accusations, 
no insults, just a calm request for help and co-operation to resolve 
what may be becoming a problem.
Step 2 – look for a solution
Ask for help. Almost everyone will respond to a request for help! 
Still no accusations, but say something like, ‘I’m not sure how 
to protect the flowers, have you got any ideas?’ This moves the 
conversation towards an amicable solution without conflict.
Step 3 – implement the solution
With understanding and agreement look for a way to make it 
happen, while building on the neighbourly relationship.
Though the example above was taken from life, the process 
leading up to the happy-ever-after solution was a little too neat 
and contrived, but it had to be to illustrate the point.
Summary
You should be talking to your neighbours and so be able to 
approach them to discuss any problems that occur (note that I 
said ‘discuss’, not ‘confront’ or ‘accuse’).
Discuss problems as soon as you can; the longer you leave 
them the worse they get and the greater the effort needed to 
resolve them.
Avoid laying blame, and any confrontation. The more amicable 
the discussion the more likely you are to agree on a solution 
that is acceptable to everyone.
Be ready to compromise to achieve a solution.

Chapter 4  · Getting On With Your Neighbours 119
Don’t see the solution as a victory, and don’t gossip about the 
conflict, or that gossip may come back to bite you, undoing all 
your good work.
KEEPING A LOG OF PROBLEM BEHAVIOUR
Sometimes a dispute cannot be resolved over a cup of tea. There 
are still options you can try. Allow things to cool off for a while, 
and then try again. Encourage your wife to talk to his wife and 
your kids to play with their kids. Have a barbecue and invite a lot 
of neighbours, including ‘them’. Have an ‘accidental’ meeting on 
neutral territory like the supermarket.
If nothing is working, and even the Citizens Advice Bureau or 
neighbourhood legal advice centre cannot help, you might have 
to take the problem to solicitors, the police or the local authority. 
Wherever you take it, you will need evidence that the pattern of 
behaviour has been going on for a period of time and you will 
have to supply it.
A complaint about constant noise cannot be upheld on the basis 
of one noisy New Years’ Eve party. To support your grievance you 
must show that the problem has been going on for weeks, and the 
way to do that is to keep a log. Your log should also include the 
steps you have taken to defuse and resolve the situation.
Your log for a noisy and aggressive neighbour might look 
something like this.

120 Chapter 4  · Getting On With Your Neighbours
Saturday, 14 January
05:00 Party at number 34 broke up at 5 a.m. Shouting in the street, guests revving their engines. John 
Smith, tenant at number 34, thought it was funny and was shouting and laughing, sounding his car horn 
continuously for two minutes.
06:45 Just got to sleep, woken by loud knocking on my front door. Found John Smith, very drunk, 
demanding to know if I wanted a fight! I told him I didn’t. He went away after five minutes, called me a 
‘flipping chicken’.
08:12 Sandra Smith (wife of John at number 34) seen by Mr Simpson at number 27 throwing empty cans 
and broken bottles over fence on to my front lawn.
11:25 p.m. Arrived home to find windows of number 34 wide open, extremely loud pop music playing. 
Neighbours complaining and somebody had called police. Police arrived same time as I did, there was an 
argument at number 34, music shut off. Music put back on at even louder volume as soon as the police 
left.
11:58 p.m. Police came back, Mr Smith arrested, music turned off again following arrest. 
Sunday, 15 January
08:00 Woken by sound of breaking glass. Got up, saw Mrs Smith from number 34 standing on my front 
lawn with a half brick in her hand, found another half brick in my lounge inside the broken window. Mrs 
Smith apparently drunk and shouting insults and claiming I had her husband arrested. I called police. Mrs 
Smith later arrested after assaulting police sergeant who attended.
Monday, 16 January
08:30 Left home to drive to work, found all four car tyres slashed. Heard shouting, saw Mr John Smith 
standing at his front door with craft knife. He was shouting, ‘Drive to work on them, you rat.’ I called 
police. Mr Smith arrested.
Tuesday, 17 January
05:00 Woken by loud music. John Smith using loudspeaker and microphone, shouting at full volume over 
the loud music. Lights on in houses up and down the road with people complaining about the Smiths. Mr 
Smith shouting through the speaker, ‘Tom is a grass. Tom’s a coward who let’s the police do his fighting. 
Come out and fight, you devil.’ Smith had a wooden pole in his hand. I feared he would damage my car so 
I went out. I told him, ‘I don’t want any trouble, John, why don’t you go and have a cup of tea and we can 
talk about this tomorrow.’ He shouted, ‘You’ll be dead by tomorrow.’
A man arrived and identified himself as William Jackson, council environmental health officer. He advised 
me to go indoors again. As I was going in through the door a car pulled up with excessively loud music 
playing and all windows open. The driver sounded his horn continuously. Police car drove up behind it (I 
later learned that they had been called by Mr Jackson), Billy Smith (son of John Smith) was arrested for 
drink-driving. Mr Jackson advised John Smith to turn music down. John Smith refused, Jackson served a 
notice and Jackson seized the Smiths’ music system with police support.

Chapter 4  · Getting On With Your Neighbours 121
This is a rather extreme case, but the log would be useful evidence 
of the problems you have had to suffer, especially if the nuisance 
went on for weeks or months. It proves that there wasn’t one 
isolated incident.
Aim to compile at least two months’ worth of evidence in your log 
while still trying to resolve the problem, as long as it is safe to do 
so. If it cannot be resolved in a friendly manner and you have to 
report it to the authorities, you have a body of evidence that points 
to a persistent problem.
Other neighbours suffering from the same problem should create 
their own log of nuisance. Don’t conspire to create logs or compile 
a neat collective log. Independently created individual logs will be 
of more evidential value.
When compiling the logs only put in what you experienced, 
know, saw and heard. Don’t pad the log out so that it looks better 
for your case. If the problem subsides for a few days, then so be it, 
you will have an empty page or two in the diary. When it starts up 
again you can carry on with the log.
Is it me?
When you have recorded a few weeks of entries, take a step back 
and ask if the problem could possibly be you? Is there a chance 
that the only problem is that you are being particularly sensitive 
about something?
Review the log. If it contains a noisy party on 24 December (the 
Smith family Christmas party), then one on 14 February (the 
Smiths’ wedding anniversary), you have to accept that there isn’t 
a pattern of ongoing nuisance.

Dealing with Bogus 
Callers
Stealing valuables is difficult: getting into a house without being 
seen, finding the valuables and getting out again without being 
caught. Wouldn’t it be good if criminals could get you to invite 
them in, give them some time to look around and then show them 
out and wave goodbye? Good for them, that is – not for you!
Some criminals manage to achieve just that. They arrive claiming 
to have official standing, talk you into letting them in, then trick 
you into leaving them alone for a while, so they can steal things. 
This is sometimes called a ‘distraction burglary’.
Two of them working together find it easier to distract you. For 
example, a bogus meter reader will ask you to hold his torch while 
he writes down the reading. His colleague, who was introduced as 
a trainee meter reader, has asked if he could use the toilet. While 
you are holding the torch in the hall, the trainee is searching and 
stealing from other rooms in the house. This could potentially 
affect anyone, but is likely to have more serious consequences for 
the elderly and infirm.
122

Chapter 5  · Dealing with Bogus Callers 123
Bogus callers come in many guises; the only effective 
countermeasure is not to let them into your home. In a single 
year 400,000 cases of bogus callers were reported. In about 35% 
of those cases, the bogus callers managed to get in and steal 
money or property. It is worth noting that this is only reported 
crime; many people feel that unreported crime is at least equal 
to reported crime, meaning that there could be up to one million 
cases each year.
BE ON THE ALERT FOR BOGUS METER READERS
Pretending to be an electricity or gas meter reader the bogus 
caller knocks at your door. They appear to be wearing some sort 
of official uniform, they have a clipboard or similar device, and a 
friendly manner. Most try to target elderly residents. They shine 
a torch, record something and then make their move. Whatever 
their stated reason for their visit, it is an excuse to get a chance to 
look around your house and pocket anything small and valuable. 
Then they leave and often the loss is not discovered for some 
while, by which time they will be long gone.
Bogus meter readers – countermeasures
The countermeasures are generally common to all bogus callers, 
though there are some countermeasures specific to different 
bogus callers.
9All officials should carry identification. If they arrive at your 
front door, ask to see their identification before letting them 
in.

124 Chapter 5  · Dealing With Bogus Callers
9If you have any doubts, check the phone book to find a number 
to call to check on the credentials of the man (or woman) on 
your doorstep.
9Never call any number they might give you; they could be 
asking you to call their crooked accomplice who will of course 
vouch for them. If you are in any doubt and cannot find a 
number for the electricity company etc., call the police and 
explain the problem.
9If the caller is genuine, he or she won’t mind waiting outside 
the front door for you to confirm their identity.
9Fit and use a door chain that allows you to open the door a 
little to talk to visitors, but prevents them from easily pushing 
the door open. If you are suspicious or unhappy about a 
caller, close the door and call the police. Do NOT open the 
door again unless it is a police officer knocking. Confirm that 
by looking out of the window for a police car and real police 
uniform.
9If you allow a visitor into your home, never leave them 
unattended. Stay with them, and if you have any doubts ask 
them to leave. If there are two of them you can politely ask 
one to stay outside as you let the other in; if they are genuine 
they will not object.
9If you are expecting any visitors, make sure that you don’t put 
unnecessary temptations before them. Lock cash, credit cards, 
handbags and wallets out of sight. Move small valuables such 
as jewellery, watches and so on away. This isn’t an insult to 
the tradesman or caller, you are simply avoiding mistakes and 
misunderstandings.

Chapter 5  · Dealing with Bogus Callers 125
9If you have any suspicions at all, call the police and explain 
the circumstances. They will check with the company or 
authority to see if they have staff in the area, and dispatch a 
police officer to check that caller.
9Blind or disabled people can usually arrange for a meter 
reader to come by appointment. They can then arrange for 
a relative or carer to be with them to make sure the meter 
reader can get in and that they only read the meter while they 
are there.
WATCH OUT FOR BOGUS COUNCIL EMPLOYEES
This is the same trick but using a different excuse, because the 
criminals claim to be from the local authority. They spin a story, 
such as checking the property prior to redecoration, replacement 
of the gutters or looking into the status of the back garden.
Their excuse is to get them through the front door. Then they 
engage the householder in their tricks, such as asking the 
householder to show one man through to check the back gutters 
while his colleague says he wants to point out a problem with the 
gutters at the front. As soon as he is out of your sight, the second 
man is searching and stealing while the first keeps you talking to 
distract you.
Bogus council employees – countermeasures
As above, plus:
9Genuine council employees usually have recognizable 
uniforms.

126 Chapter 5  · Dealing With Bogus Callers
9Genuine council employees often make an appointment with 
householders.
9Genuine council employees usually drive distinctive vehicles 
in council livery – council colours, with council crests painted 
on the sides. (BUT – I know of one bogus caller who drove an 
ex-council van he bought at auction.) If you are in any doubt, 
call the council BEFORE you let them in!
9If you can’t get through to the council, call the police and 
explain your concerns.
BEWARE OF BOGUS TRAVELLERS IN DISTRESS
There are many different versions of this trick. Basically, 
somebody plausible arrives at your front door and claims to have 
broken down or had an accident and asks to use the phone or the 
toilet etc. I did hear of a group of ten-year-old children (yes, even 
young kids can be criminals too) claiming they had lost a puppy 
and asking if they could come in to look for it!
Their aims are the same, to engage you in their tricks and 
engineer an opportunity to take a look around your home and 
steal as much as they can.
Bogus travellers in distress – countermeasures
As above, plus:
9Don’t open the door, if you do, keep the door chain on.

Chapter 5  · Dealing with Bogus Callers 127
9If somebody really has broken down and you want to help, 
tell them to push their AA or RAC membership card through 
the letterbox and you will make the telephone call for them. A 
genuine traveller should have no objection to that.
9Beware of anyone who wants to come into or close to the 
house, be it searching for a lost puppy or any other excuse.
If you scare bogus callers away, ring the police anyway and warn 
them that you think thieves are operating in the area. They can 
then alert other people.
DON’T BE FOOLED BY BOGUS WORKMEN
Cowboy workmen try to trick their way into homes by claiming 
that while passing they noticed that you need urgent work done 
on the roof, the wall, the chimney, the gutters – or any other area. 
Sometimes they just want to demand huge fees for work they 
haven’t done; sometimes this is a way of gaining access to your 
house to steal things.
Bogus workmen – countermeasures
As above, plus:
9Never listen to a door-to-door salesman, builder, gardener or 
any other tradesman. If you have not asked them to call on 
you, tell them no thanks and ask them to leave. If they show 
the slightest hesitation call the police.

128 Chapter 5  · Dealing With Bogus Callers
9If you do need work done ask friends, family and neighbours 
to recommend a reliable, trustworthy tradesman who does 
good work for a fair price.
9Get at least three quotes for the work and tell them you are 
getting three quotes. Arrange for somebody to be with you 
when they come to do the quote, and stay with them at all 
times.
9Check to make sure that they have a known company name 
and address. Cowboy tradesmen often advertise with just a 
mobile number for a contact. If that is all they are willing to 
give you, say no thanks! Before agreeing to give them the 
work visit the address to make sure they are actually based 
there in case things go wrong.
9When you get a quote, make sure that there are no additional 
hidden fees. Some quotes do not include VAT, or materials, 
or design services, or arrangements of council planning 
permission etc. What you want is an all-in price.
9Get a schedule of work with the quote: when they will start 
and when the job will be finished. If you get a vague ‘Should 
take a couple of days and I think I can start next week’ say 
no.
9Check their references which should preferably be from local 
people you know or can visit to check on the tradesman and 
his work.
9NEVER pay until you are absolutely and completely happy 
that the work is completed and that they have done a good 
job.

Chapter 5  · Dealing with Bogus Callers 129
9Beware of workmen who ask for money up front to buy 
materials for your job. Though some smaller builders may 
have a cash flow problem and need you to pay for materials 
in advance of the job, too many cowboys use that as a trick 
to part you from your money. I personally will not use a 
workman who wants any money in advance.
BOGUS SALES PEOPLE ARE A DOUBLE RISK
This is because they could talk their way into your home to 
steal things, but their crime may be to get you to buy something 
worthless or which they have no intention of delivering.
Bogus sales people – countermeasures
As above, plus:
9Never buy anything on your doorstep, no matter how good 
a bargain they may offer, and no matter how much pressure 
they might put on you by claiming it is a limited offer or the 
last one for sale etc.
9If you say no, it’s too expensive and they suddenly decide they 
can reduce the price by 20% or extend the deadline – do they 
sound honest? Wave goodbye, they are dishonest tricksters.
9Sales people are practised at getting your sympathy as a 
recognized sales technique. If the salesman starts looking for 
sympathy, such as saying he will get the sack if he doesn’t 
make a sale today, ask him to leave.

130 Chapter 5  · Dealing With Bogus Callers
9Even staff of reputable companies can try to wear you down. 
Double-glazing salesmen have been known to talk for five 
hours, attempting to break the will of a householder to force 
them to say yes just to get rid of him. When you have had 
enough, be blunt – be rude if you have to – tell them to leave.
9The best countermeasure of all is don’t open the door, and 
don’t let them in.
9In all cases, if they don’t go – call the police.
GENERAL ADVICE FOR GETTING THE BETTER
OF BOGUS CALLERS
No matter what they pretend to be, they want to get inside your 
house and distract you while they steal money or valuables. Stay 
alert and stop them from targeting you or others in your area.
General – countermeasures
As above, plus:
9Keep the phone number of the local police at hand. If you 
suspect that bogus caller criminals are operating in your 
area, report them before they have a chance to steal from 
vulnerable people nearby.
9If it is an emergency, call 999, ask for the police and report the 
criminals.
9If you live near any elderly or infirm people, be neighbourly. If 
you see strangers on their doorstep, especially if they appear 

Chapter 5  · Dealing with Bogus Callers 131
to be trying to talk their way in, take the time to drop by and 
‘say hello’. If the neighbour introduces you to their nephew, 
‘Hank from America’, OK, but they may be glad of the support 
to get rid of a persistent double-glazing salesman or a criminal 
trying his luck.
9If you do see suspicious activity in your street, YOU should 
call the police and report your suspicions. If the police have 
resources available they will send somebody to check out the 
strangers in your area.
9Beware, some fittings and fixtures indicate that a resident is 
infirm and/or vulnerable, which will make them more likely 
to be targeted by criminals. Handrails beside the front door, 
wheelchair access ramps or perhaps an electric wheelchair 
and charging point outside a house indicate that at least 
one resident is disabled or infirm. Similarly, an overgrown 
garden and poor house maintenance could indicate an infirm 
disabled or elderly resident.
9If you report somebody, remember to give appropriate details. 
For more information on this, see Chapter 6 below.

If the Worst Happens
There are criminals out there; crime happens, no matter how 
careful you are. You could be unlucky and find that you are the 
victim of a crime. If the worst happens, what should you do – and 
why?
REPORT INCIDENTS TO THE POLICE
If you do have to make a telephone call about a suspicious caller, 
be ready to give as good a description as you can. If all you can 
report is ‘A guy with black hair’, don’t expect the police to find 
him.
To find and question your suspicious character, the police need a 
better description than that, so they know who to look for while 
they are driving around or checking via CCTV cameras in the 
town. The more unique identifiers you can give, the easier it will 
be to find that person. If you describe a white male, six feet six 
inches tall, shaved head, white trousers and a dark blue jumper, 
they have something to work on. It’s easy to look for a ‘very tall 
bald guy with white trousers and dark blue jumper’.
132

Chapter 6  · If the Worst Happens 133
When they find him they may want further details which will 
confirm it is your man. Such as, ‘He spoke with a Welsh accent 
and had a little red crest on the left breast of his jumper. He had 
nicotine stains on the fingers of his left hand, a snake tattoo on 
the back of his right hand and he presented what looked like 
a home-made gas company identity card stating he was Frank 
James – District Assessor.
That gives the police plenty to work on, and if Mr Frank James 
really is the District Assessor with the local gas company, he won’t 
mind you being careful. If he isn’t, he will wish he hadn’t come to 
your door!
If you are reporting something to the police, or recording an 
incident in a log, write it down as soon as you can, while it is fresh 
in your memory. That way names, car registration numbers and 
other such details don’t get lost or confused.
Giving a good description
Depending on the circumstances include:
sex;
age;
height;
weight/build;
race/colour;
hair colour/length/style/ornaments etc.;

134 Chapter 6  · If the Worst Happens
clothing/style/colour/markings etc.;
jewellery;
identifying marks – tattoo/birthmarks/scars etc.;
voice/accent/impediment (stutter);
names used – called himself ‘Frank James’ – or colleague 
called him ‘Barry’ etc.;
anything carried/bag/briefcase/clipboard;
other identifying features, e.g. limp on left leg;
what he said – e.g. claimed to be charity collector;
what did he/they touch/eat/drink etc. (fingerprints and 
DNA);
did they call on anyone else in the area who could give an 
independent description to police? ‘He called on Mrs Biggins 
at number 42 before he came to me.’
did they have a vehicle – if so, give its:
x
make;
x
model;
x
colour;
x
age;
x
registration number or partial number;
x
markings, e.g. ‘Grabbit & Scarper – Builders’ in black 
lettering on side of light blue van – no phone number 
shown;
x
other identifying features, e.g. rusty roof rack, broken left 
headlight etc.;

Chapter 6  · If the Worst Happens 135
x
direction of travel if it has left the scene, e.g. ‘They turned 
left on to the A40, heading into town.’
The more detail you can supply, the easier you make it for the 
police to track down the culprit. You should be using your powers 
of observation and filing details away in your memory so that you 
can accurately report them later.
If you call the police, ask if anyone will be coming to look for 
fingerprints or other evidence. Tell the police what you have 
found in your home and ask them when somebody will come. 
If your house has been burgled or vandalized you don’t want to 
leave broken glass in the kitchen for a week.
If they say an expert will not be visiting you until after the 
weekend, for instance, explain your circumstances. It may not 
matter, or you may have to tidy up in order to shut the back door, or 
get a window boarded up or repaired, or you may need to tidy the 
bedroom so that you can go to bed. Whatever the circumstances, 
explain them to the police.
Try to Protect, Record, Search and Detail evidence of a crime.
Protect
The police may send a fingerprint expert around to your home. If 
a suspicious caller has entered your home you will know what the 
criminal touched, so you should make a note of that, and protect 
any surfaces that may still contain his or her fingerprints. For 
example, they took a bite out of a biscuit while they were there or 
touched the glass shelf in the kitchen. Tell that to the police and 
don’t touch it until the police have checked it.

136 Chapter 6  · If the Worst Happens
Record
The police are often very busy, so there may be nobody free to talk 
to you until later that day. Any victim should sit and write down as 
much as they can remember while it is fresh in their mind. Record 
the details of any known offender, and make a quick note of what 
they did, from the time they came in to the time they left. What 
did they say? What did they touch? Did they sneeze into a tissue 
and then throw it into the bin? Make a note of everything before 
you forget. DON’T touch anything until the police have had a 
chance to look at it. They have skills and experience that you don’t 
have, and while there may be no clues in the untidy heap on the 
living room carpet, you don’t want to lose them by being tidy!
If your suspicious caller left through the back door, walked 
through the flowerbed and jumped over the back fence, take a 
look without disturbing things. If there is a set of footprints in the 
rose border, point them out to the police when they come. If it is 
coming on to rain and you don’t know when the police will arrive, 
consider protecting the footprints if you can. A dustbin lid or a 
sheet of plastic will protect the print from the rain, as long as you 
are careful not to damage the prints while you are doing it.
Search
You have given the police as much information about the criminal 
as you can. Grandfather’s antique gold pocket watch is missing, 
but is that all; did the criminal take anything else? Without 
disturbing evidence, check to see if anything else is or could be 
missing. Where did the criminal go, what did he or she have 
access to? They didn’t go near the back bedroom so your savings 
are safe in the wardrobe. They were alone in the kitchen so ask 

Chapter 6  · If the Worst Happens 137
the policeman to check if the criminal moved the blue glass vase 
and took the cash box hidden behind it in the cupboard.
Details
We can help the police by digging out more information if we can 
do so without disturbing evidence.
It will help if we can give the police pictures of Grandfather’s 
antique gold watch, as well as the serial numbers and valuations. 
All of that will make it easier to find the culprit and the missing 
items.
DISCOVERING AN INTRUDER
Most burglars won’t enter a house when the owner is at home. 
Occasionally they make mistakes and people have been woken by 
the sound of an intruder, even during the day. If you disturb an 
intruder all they will want to do is to get out and get away.
Never attempt to challenge, detain or capture an intruder; you 
don’t know what state of mind they are in. They might even be 
scared enough to use the screwdriver they used to break open 
your window as a weapon. Let them go.
Discovering an intruder – countermeasures
9Don’t try to catch them or see them.
9Make as much noise as you can. Shout, use a mobile phone 
to call the police, make any noise. If there is an intruder, they 
will run. (The first thing a burglar usually does after entering 

138 Chapter 6  · If the Worst Happens
any premises is to secure his exit route by opening the front or 
back door etc.).
9At the first sign of disturbance they will run and you will be 
safe.
9Prepare to be a little embarrassed. Nine times out of ten, the 
‘late night intruder’ will be your cat coming in for a sleep, 
water pipes creaking, or your teenagers coming in late or 
somebody getting up for a midnight snack.
COMING HOME TO AN INTRUDER
If you come home to find the front door is open and, even more 
rarely, there is somebody moving around upstairs using a torch to 
search for valuables, don’t challenge them. Take this advice.
Coming home to an intruder – countermeasures
9Don’t disturb them or warn them of your presence.
9Stay back and out of sight if you can, use a mobile phone to 
call the police.
9Explain that you have returned home to find that intruders 
are still on the premises.
9Pass on any additional information you have. Did you see two 
people in the house, or a strange white van parked outside 
your house? Give all the information you have to the police. 
Try to stay on the line to give a commentary on what is 
happening. Stay back and stay safe.

Chapter 6  · If the Worst Happens 139
GET A POLICE CRIME REFERENCE NUMBER
When you report a crime to the police they usually take the 
details and give you a reference number that relates to that crime 
report, but they may call it something different. If they do give 
you a crime reference number make a note of it because you will 
need it, especially if you are making a claim on your insurance. If 
they don’t give you a reference number ask for one.
PROTECT, RECORD, SEARCH, AND DETAIL
EVIDENCE OF THE CRIME
To sum up, if there has been a crime, protect the rest of your 
valuables and any evidence there may be. Record everything you 
know as soon as you can, before you forget details. Search, as far 
as you can without disturbing evidence, to see what else has been 
disturbed and/or taken. Produce as much detail as you can for the 
police, including make, model, serial number and photographs 
of stolen property. All of this will be very helpful in tracing the 
property and identifying the criminal.
CLAIMING OFF YOUR INSURANCE
If you have insurance, contact the insurance company to report 
the crime and make a claim. If you make a claim before you have 
had time to undertake a thorough search, report everything that 
has been stolen, but tell them that there could be other things that 
you may wish to add later.

140 Chapter 6  · If the Worst Happens
Most insurance companies require you to give them a relevant 
police crime reference number. Some stipulate that unless you 
report the crime to the police and receive a crime reference 
number, you wont be able to claim on your insurance.
REVIEWING YOUR SECURITY AFTER A CRIME
Perhaps the burglar just used a paving slab to smash the glass 
in your patio door, but he may have found a weakness in 
your security. Whatever the circumstances, you must perform 
an immediate security review to identify vulnerabilities and 
implement countermeasures where possible to prevent any 
further loss.
Don’t make your house too secure. Sometimes people react 
to crime by introducing ultra high security, triple locking and 
bolting all of the doors and putting steel bars on the windows. 
Nobody wants to live in a fortress, and remember, you need to be 
able to get out quickly if there is a fire, so only take ‘reasonable 
countermeasures’.
RECLAIMING YOUR HOME AFTER A CRIME
Your home is your private domain, a place where you should be 
able to relax and feel safe. Many people feel that a burglary or 
other criminal intrusion damages or destroys that feeling of safety 
and security. In their mind the home feels corrupted and sullied 
because the criminal has violated their space.

Chapter 6  · If the Worst Happens 141
Some people feel strongly that happy family memories are 
overwritten by the burglary, and missing items and broken 
windows constantly remind them of the intruder. Women often 
experience revulsion and fear more than men, and that ‘bad 
feeling’ causes additional stress to the family after the crime.
Though it will fade over time, it is distressing and damaging to 
family life. However, these feelings can be erased, overwritten, 
washed away or counterbalanced with ‘good memories’. Victims 
of intruder crimes have found that the following measures have 
helped to make their house feel like home again.
Fix the problem – countermeasures
9First, and most importantly, find out how the criminal 
overcame your security and take steps to stop it happening 
again. You will sleep easier knowing that your security is tight 
again.
Refresh or remove – countermeasures
9Where possible and affordable, dispose of anything that has 
been sullied by the touch of the criminal. (I remember a lady 
who refused to wear any of her clothes because the burglar 
had searched through her clothes looking for valuables.)
9If furniture is involved, you can swap a ‘tainted’ dressing 
table that the burglar looked through with a similar one at a 
second-hand shop for a modest fee, or swap it with a relative!
9Brand new bed sheets really feel ‘clean and new’ if you can 
afford to buy them. Get a similar relief by swapping bedding 
and curtains with relatives.

142 Chapter 6  · If the Worst Happens
9It may be possible to professionally clean an item that has 
been corrupted by an intruder; for example, have the carpets 
professionally cleaned to remove all traces of the villain. The 
basic rule is to take any steps you can to refresh your home.
Decorate – countermeasures
9Some people sense the ‘smell’ and ‘feel’ of the criminal’s 
presence constantly. Redecorating gives the house a fresh 
new look, and helps by distancing the current home from the 
home that was violated by an intruder.
Party – countermeasures
9After taking as many steps as are practical and affordable 
to you, you should have a party for as many good friends 
and relatives as you can. Warn them that any discussion or 
questions about the crime will destroy what you have been 
trying to achieve. Make this the happiest party ever, flooding 
the ‘new look’ home with new happy memories revolving 
around friends, fun and a good time.
Combination – countermeasures
9I knew a lady who was so traumatized by a burglary that she 
wanted to sell up and move out. Her husband arranged for her 
to stay with their daughter for a holiday. While she was away, 
he installed new door and window locks, a burglar alarm, 
and passive sensor-operated lighting on the sides and rear of 
the house. He also decorated throughout and upgraded the 
kitchen. The lady came home to a big party and said it was 
like coming into a new house.

Chapter 6  · If the Worst Happens 143
Hopefully, all of those actions will make the home feel like a 
safe shelter from the world again. Remember, children may be 
traumatized too! After talking things through sensibly, and listing 
the new security measures that you have taken to make the house 
even safer, stop talking about the crime and do anything you can 
to help yourself and your family to rebuild the feeling of security 
that they need.

Implementing 
Your Chosen 
Countermeasures
When you have completed your home security survey, what should 
you do? This chapter suggests a simple approach to selecting, 
documenting and implementing your countermeasures.
IDENTIFYING SECURITY ISSUES
You have probably already started responding to and resolving 
some of the problems you identified. The next step is to formally 
manage and resolve the outstanding problems by implementing 
appropriate countermeasures.
During the survey you may have simply listed problems and 
appropriate countermeasures, or you may have added pages of 
notes. Some countermeasures may have been so simple that you 
have already carried them out, such as shutting the utility room 
window instead of leaving it open for the cat. Other problems and 
countermeasures are waiting your attention. Your next task is to 
decide what to implement, how, and in what order, to do it.
144

Chapter 7  · Implementing Your Chosen Countermeasures 145
LIST PROBLEMS AND COUNTERMEASURES
From the notes you took during the security review, draw up a 
tidy list of all of the problems you identified.
Against each problem, list any appropriate countermeasures. There 
may be problems for which you have not yet identified possible 
countermeasures. If so, list them without countermeasures.
The problems you identify may be quite lengthy, for example ‘Front 
door swells up and sticks in winter, but dries out and shrinks in 
summer, making the front door loose and insecure or too stiff to 
open.’ Assign each problem with a number and key word.
Ref No

146 Chapter 7  · Implementing Your Chosen Countermeasures
Identify and select countermeasures
Take some time to review and research the countermeasures. 
This allows you to select and list those that you will implement. 
Research may include the following:
Seek expert advice – which locks are best for a patio or a 
garage?
Investigate the need for planning permission to erect a wall or 
fence.
Seek permission for structural changes from your landlord.
Look into the availability and cost of new fixtures and 
fittings.
Investigate availability, time, skills, tools and costs involved in 
implementing specific countermeasure.
Seek advice from police, they may suggest countermeasures 
where you could not identify one.
This should help you to select the countermeasures you want to 
introduce to improve your security and to compile a final list of all 
identified problems and proposed countermeasures.
Establish countermeasure priority
Using Post-it notes or slips of paper, sort them into order of 
priority, under four main headings:
(I) IMMEDIATE;
(S) SOON;

Chapter 7  · Implementing Your Chosen Countermeasures 147
(I and W) IF AND WHEN POSSIBLE;
(NS) NON-SECURITY.
Write the reference number and key word of each problem and 
the countermeasures on a new Post-it note and add them to the 
appropriate list.
Thus you might write ‘SR1/1 Porch – fit porch light’ and on 
another Post-it note, ‘SR1/1 Porch – fit door viewer’. Using the 
reference number and key word makes the task manageable, and 
what you write is enough to remind you what it is.
Using your perception of the priority, time required, cost, skills, 
impact and benefit, produce a final countermeasure priority list. 
Remember that the priority rating you assign to each one will be a 
combination of factors, the most important of which are:
the threat or risk that the countermeasure will remove or 
protect against. A rotten front door to which you lost two keys 
with address tags is a major concern. The door is no longer 
secure at all;
the time required to implement the countermeasure. 
Replacing the front door will take about half a day;
the cost of implementing the countermeasure. A total of £418 
is quite expensive, but a secure front door is so fundamental 
to the security of your house that it must be done as soon as 
possible;

148 Chapter 7  · Implementing Your Chosen Countermeasures
the skills needed to implement the countermeasure. A 
carpenter must fit the door. If you don’t have those skills you 
must hire someone who does;
the impact on your family and your house of implementing 
the countermeasure. Having no front door for half a day 
while it is replaced is OK in summer. I can work at home that 
day so the impact is minimal;
the overall benefits that will be gained by implementing the 
countermeasure. A professionally installed door, frame and 
new locks etc. will be totally secure;
the financial benefits of increased security. Insurance 
companies may reduce insurance premiums when double-
glazing and multi-point-locking external doors are fitted.
If you have too many countermeasures to cope with, do the sorting 
in stages. Take each item and put it into piles: (I) Immediate; (S) 
Soon; (I and W) If and When possible; and (NS) Non-security. 
Then carefully review and sort each problem in each pile 
separately.
Immediate list contains all actions that should be completed 
urgently, such as replacing that front door. It may include 
apparently ‘non-urgent’ items such as that the bushes at the 
front of the house should be cut back. That is not ‘urgent’, but 
it will only take half an hour, it costs nothing and you can do 
it before it gets dark. You may as well do it now and cross it off 
the list, so it appears on the immediate list.
Soon list contains all actions that should be completed soon, 
but are not urgent or immediate as such. Examples include 

Chapter 7  · Implementing Your Chosen Countermeasures 149
replacing the lock on the garage door. The old lock still 
works at the moment, so you will get a new garage lock next 
month.
If and When Possible list contains actions that deliver ‘nice 
to have’ countermeasures, such as a state-of-the-art burglar 
alarm. It would increase household security immeasurably, 
but at £3,000 it will just be a ‘nice to have’ countermeasure.
Non-Security List contains those countermeasures not 
directly related to security, but which you would be foolish to 
ignore. Examples include a loose slate that you spotted when 
performing the perimeter survey. You must resolve these, and 
the non-security list is the mechanism through which you 
manage them.
Countermeasure prioritization
You must consider all factors in order to prioritize the 
countermeasures. The process is straightforward, though not 
necessarily simple. Follow the example below, which illustrates 
the thoughts and processes in sorting just four countermeasures.
1. 
Cut down shrubs in front garden.
2. Replace broken front door lock.
3. 
Renew old front door.
4. 
Ensure house always locked when we leave.
See the sample prioritized list below, with explanations to help 
you understand why I set them in this order.

150 Chapter 7  · Implementing Your Chosen Countermeasures
Prioritized Actions
Explanation as to why the countermeasures were 
placed in this priority order
1. Everyone to agree to ensure 
that the house is always locked 
when we leave.
During the security survey my wife and I realized we are sometimes 
a little careless about household security – not locking up if we are 
‘only nipping down to the shops’. We recognized the risk and have 
already agreed always to lock and secure the house every time we 
go out. This action was agreed, and completed over breakfast this 
morning.
2. Cut down shrubs in front 
garden.
We have avoided tackling the front garden. We didn’t think it 
mattered but we now realize that the overgrown bushes could help 
burglars to raid our house. The shops are shut so we cannot tackle the 
other countermeasures. We’ll therefore make best use of our time and 
cut the bushes back now. NOTE: If the shops had been open, this would 
have been a lower priority, but due to current circumstances it became 
the highest priority because it is the only countermeasure we can do 
anything to implement now. 
3. Replace broken front door 
lock.
The front door lock has been temperamental for months, but we put 
off getting it fixed because we want a new front door. Now we realize 
that a secure front door is important and as soon as the shops open 
tomorrow we’ll buy and fit a new lock. It won’t be a waste because 
the carpenter says he can use that new lock on the new door when he 
fits it.
4. Renew old front door.
The current front door is warped and when the wind is from the west 
it lets rain in. There is some rot at the bottom of the door, but it is 
adequate for now. I don’t have the skills and tools needed to fit a 
new door, so we will have to pay for a new door to be fitted. John the 
carpenter says he will do it next month when we can afford it. 
It is perfectly acceptable for you to prioritize the countermeasures 
in a different order. The whole point of this method and process 
is to tailor the reviews, actions and countermeasures to your 
personal circumstances.

Chapter 7  · Implementing Your Chosen Countermeasures 151
Revisit and revise your priorities
Your circumstances may change over time, and this may alter the 
order in which countermeasures are implemented. A new front 
door is your highest priority so you have one on order, but the 
earliest delivery is four weeks away. In that case you have time 
to do some other lower priority tasks. That is acceptable. If you 
address the items in priority order, resolving them as soon as you 
can, the order in which they are completed doesn’t really matter.
Prioritization considerations
The list below includes issues that may affect your priority 
decisions. Take a while to think of the other pressures and 
restrictions that are unique to you.
Considerations
Explanation/examples of why an action may be delayed
Money
If you cannot afford it, it will have to wait.
Time available
If you don’t have time, it will have to wait.
Skills/knowledge
If you don’t know how to do it, or lack special skills, it will have to wait.
Tools/equipment
If you don’t have specialist tools and equipment required, it will have to wait 
until you do.
Weather/season
You may have to wait for warm dry weather before tackling an exterior task.
Planning rules
You may have to wait for planning permission.
Assistance
You may have to wait until somebody is available to help you. 
Keep track of the ‘as and when possible’ list of countermeasures. 
They may be beyond your means now, but keep them in mind 
because your circumstances may change.

152 Chapter 7  · Implementing Your Chosen Countermeasures
DRAW UP AN ACTION LIST
Implementing 
one 
countermeasure 
may 
be 
easy, 
while 
implementing another may be a major project. For each 
countermeasure you may want to list the actions required to 
implement it. On an action list the tasks needed are listed in 
the order in which they need to be completed to deliver the 
countermeasure.
Of course, if the countermeasure is simple, such as fitting a new 
bulb in the porch light, you won’t bother to create an action list, 
but where the countermeasure is more complicated an action list 
will be a huge help.
Example action list
Standardize house identification in our street. For this 
countermeasure we must look at the actions we will need to 
complete in order to implement it. The list will show each action 
needed, in the order in which they must be completed. When 
finished, the action list also becomes a plan, check-list and work 
schedule that will help you to introduce that countermeasure.
For this example the action list may consist of the following 
measures.
Research availability, style, size and cost of house name 
signs.
Research methods of erecting house name signs for optimum 
visibility.

Chapter 7  · Implementing Your Chosen Countermeasures 153
Investigate the possibility of discounts if we all buy from the 
same company.
Check that the most appropriate sign and mounting system 
will work on every property in the road.
Discuss the proposal with emergency services and record 
their comments.
Find local handyman who could install all of the signs.
Make presentation to residents’ committee of risks and 
dangers of emergency services being unable to find any given 
house. Describe problems when testing finding a house in 
dark and rain, explain damage and risk to security and health 
of everyone in the street.
Make presentation of research into signs. Present samples 
and costs, noting savings and discounts negotiated. Describe 
comments from emergency services re standardized sign 
initiative.
Request that residents’ association vote.
If accepted, all residents to fill in order form and pay for their 
sign and erection.
Take delivery of the new signs and mounting brackets etc.
Arrange with the handyman to fit all of the signs.
When those steps are completed, the countermeasure has been 
implemented. NOTE: the necessary steps and actions could take 
some weeks to complete.

154 Chapter 7  · Implementing Your Chosen Countermeasures
Action list considerations
The action list for more complex countermeasures (shown here) 
also helps you to understand the effort, cost and time required to 
implement each countermeasure, because it allows you to break 
down the tasks required into manageable and understandable 
proportions, arriving at a work schedule, time-scale and cost.

The example schedule shows that there is almost no cost to 
implement this countermeasure, other than actually buying the 
signs and having them erected.
At 37 days, 2 hours and 25 minutes, the time required seems 
excessive, but as the objective is to make every house in the street 
easily identifiable, a lead time of a month or so is quite acceptable. 
But if we take a closer look at the time required, we can see that it 
may not take a month.
Most of the time allocated is for research as a background task 
for one resident, and it includes waiting time for quotes to 
come through the post.
Look at the sequence too.
x
Action 1 – research availability and cost of signs.
x
Action 2 – research method of erecting those signs. So 
actions 1 and 2 can possibly be run in parallel.
x
Action 3 – research possible discounts, which can probably 
be done on first contact, so action 3 can run in parallel 
with actions 1 and 2.
x
Action 4 – check the option will work on all houses. 
Though listed to take a day, this can be done quite early 
in the process and could be completed before actions 1, 2, 
and 3 are completed, so they will all run in parallel.
x
Action 5 – consult emergency services. We can easily talk 
about what we are planning, and anything that helps 
them will no doubt be popular.
x
Actions 7, 8, 9 and 10 take only a short time at the next 
residents’ association meeting.
x
Action 11 takes one day because the company offers next-
day delivery!

156 Chapter 7  · Implementing Your Chosen Countermeasures
x
Though the total time added up to 37 days, 2 hours and 25 
minutes, in reality – with a bit of luck – the handyman can 
start putting the new signs up within a couple of weeks!
No special skills are required, with no real impact.
The details for each action could include:
x
Time – how long (measured in hours) will it take.
x
Cost – how much will it cost to do it?
x
Skills – any special skills required.
x
Impacts – you must decide what, if any, impacts the 
countermeasure will have. You could perhaps find that 
to erect the new sign the handyman has to turn off the 
electricity in your house for a short while.
Here is an additional sample action list.
Badger View – ‘new front door’ action list 
Countermeasure
Actions 
Priority
Fit new front door
Time – 4 hrs for carpenter to 
install it.
Cost – £145 for door, £78 for 
door furniture; preparation 
and labour, £195.
Skills – carpenter with 
experience of locks and other 
security devices.
Impact – door will be removed 
for 4 hours, somebody will 
have to be at home that day.
1. Speak to carpenter and explain 
requirement.
2. Select door from range carpenter has 
available.
3. With advice from carpenter select locks 
and security devices.
4. Select other door furniture.
5. Check, approve and accept final total cost.
6. Arrange date for work to be done. Book 
that day off work.
7. Remove keys and furniture from front hall 
so carpenter has room to work.
8. Watch carpenter to confirm he is doing 
what was asked and make sure nobody 
sneaks into house while front door is 
removed.
IMMEDIATE
The existing front door 
is rotten, the frame 
is loose and two front 
door keys cannot be 
found.

Badger View – non-security ‘loft plumbing’ action list
Countermeasure
Actions 
Priority
Lag pipes in loft
Time – 1 hour.
Cost – £12 to buy lagging 
material.
Skills – none needed.
Impact – none.
1. Buy DIY pack of pipe lagging.
2. Fit lagging to the pipes that 
are not lagged.
IMMEDIATE
It is autumn, long-range forecasts 
predict very cold weather next 
month. It would be foolish not to do 
the job this weekend.
GUARDING AGAINST ACCIDENTS AT HOME
Security is the application of methods and procedures used to 
make our lifestyle secure against any vulnerabilities, threats 
and risks. By applying security appropriately, we will maximize 
safety.
Accidents are a threat to our safety and security, so we will take 
a brief look at accident prevention in the home. Most injuries are 
caused by accidents inside the home, resulting in injuries and 
fatalities.
Some if the most common accidents are the following.
Falls/slips/trips Causes include loose carpet; toys left on stairs 
and steps; trailing wires and loose floorboards etc; using 
inappropriate items to climb to reach high objects (climbing 
on furniture instead of using a ladder); small dogs (tripping 
elderly people); and wet floors/oil spillage etc.

158 Chapter 7  · Implementing Your Chosen Countermeasures
Burns/scalds Causes include spills or misuse of boiling water; 
food (hot drinks and soup), cooking oil; household chemicals 
(bleach and other caustic materials); hot utensils (burns from 
cooking dishes) etc.
Poisoning Causes include gas (faulty gas appliances/blocked 
air vents/faulty devices/poor installation and maintenance); 
misuse of household and garden chemicals (child drinks 
weedkiller kept in lemonade bottle) etc.
Cuts Includes cuts from broken glass; misuse of knives 
and tools (using a knife as a screwdriver); and carelessness 
(cutting your hand as you open a baked bean tin) etc.
Electrocution Often caused by unskilled people attempting to 
repair a vacuum cleaner or other faulty device, and unskilled 
attempts to install or amend electrical wiring.
Explosions Caused by misuse of gas and/or flammable fluids, 
such as naked flame exposed to gas leak, or perhaps careless 
storage and use of petrol.
Fire Can be caused by some of the above behaviour and 
activity, careless disposal of cigarettes; carelessness in the use 
of gas and electric fires; paraffin heaters; or lack of care when 
burning rubbish or letting off fireworks.
Machinery injury Often caused by misuse of garden 
equipment (lawn mowers, hedge trimmers, chain-saws), 
vehicles, kitchen equipment (blenders, waste disposal units), 
electrical tools (drills, planes or disc cutters).

Chapter 7  · Implementing Your Chosen Countermeasures 159
Combination Any of the above causes could act in combination, 
for example misuse of electric drill causing fuel to leak which 
causes fire and explosion.
Accidents at home – countermeasures
Don’t make your home as secure from crime as you can and then 
allow yourself and family members to be injured or killed by 
careless accidents.
9Use or wear recommended safety equipment, safety glasses, 
gloves and steel-toed boots etc.
9Read, understand and follow carefully all instructions for any 
tool or equipment.
9Use safety guards and equipment at all times.
9If you are unsure or have any safety concerns, stop what you 
are doing. Seek advice, guidance and/or training.
9Keep your working area clear of obstructions or hazards 
before beginning work.
9Take all safety measures seriously and never take shortcuts.
9Always keep tools and equipment in perfect working order 
and check them before using them.
9Warn anyone else when you are about to start a job, and if 
necessary erect protective barriers.

160 Chapter 7  · Implementing Your Chosen Countermeasures
9Before you begin any job, take some time first to consider and 
assess the risk and to get everything ready before you start.
9As a general rule, make sure that your living and working 
areas are clean, clear and tidy.

Putting things into 
Perspective 
We have discussed criminals, the ways in which they target us 
and the level and value of crime, but take a moment to put all of 
this into perspective.
THE MEDIA CAN EXAGGERATE THE THREAT
OF CRIME
The front pages of newspapers are often the only source of 
information on crime that is available to the average person. 
Unfortunately, editors of some newspapers make their front pages 
as spectacular and as lurid as possible in order to sell more copies 
of their paper.
Though newspapers and other media often give the impression 
that our society has broken down, crime levels are nowhere 
near as bad as most people think. True, they are increasing, 
but statistically the average person is unlikely to be affected by 
crime. So, if you are taking steps to protect yourself, by removing 
vulnerabilities and avoiding risks and threats, you are already 
more security-conscious than the average person.
161

162 Chapter 8  · Putting Things Into Perspective
REMEMBER, if the average person is statistically unlikely to be the 
victim of a crime, then by reading and acting on the advice and 
information in books such as this one, you should be highly unlikely
to be the victim of crime.
TAKE THE COMMON-SENSE APPROACH
You are extremely unlikely to be involved in headline-grabbing 
and exotic crimes.
A good level of security is quite easy to achieve when you know 
how.
Good security is based on:
remaining aware of your surroundings;
recognizing what is happening around you, concentrating on 
anything that could develop in a way that could affect you, 
your property or your loved ones;
recognizing vulnerabilities that could leave you open to 
threats and risks;
proactively addressing vulnerabilities to remove or reduce 
them to an acceptable level;
identifying and assessing the threat posed by risks as they 
develop, then taking steps to avoid them or reduce their 
impact to acceptable levels;

Chapter 8  · Putting Things Into Perspective 163
taking common-sense steps to protect yourself and your 
property, such as:
x
not getting drunk; drunks are far more likely to become 
the victim of theft, robbery, assault and other crimes. 
They are also far more likely to commit crimes such as 
theft, criminal damage and assaults;
x
not leaving valuables visible in an unattended car;
x
never leaving your keys in your car;
x
taking care to keep your handbag, purse, wallet and other 
portable valuables with you or locked securely away;
x
making sure that your house is as secure as you can make 
it at all times;
x
being cautious with visitors who want to come into your 
house;
x
being cautious when disclosing personal information, in 
forms, on the Internet, when ordering goods and when 
using your credit cards;
x
shredding personal documents; don’t let the criminals 
steal your identity.
TRY NOT TO WORRY TOO MUCH
Don’t devote your whole existence to ‘staying safe’. Don’t believe 
the scare stories you see on the television news and the front 
pages of the newspapers, just learn the lessons that apply to you 
and your life. Don’t become preoccupied with types and levels of 
crime that do not concern you and will never affect you.

Security awareness should be as natural and automatic a part of 
your lifestyle as safely crossing the road. You don’t constantly 
worry about roads and traffic; you don’t walk around in fear of 
becoming the victim of a traffic accident. You have learned and 
developed the skill of crossing a road safely when you need to. I 
suggest that security can and should become a similar ‘automatic’ 
skill, given guidance and practice.
Remember that just by considering your security and taking the 
simplest measures you are 100% less likely to become the victim 
of crime. Stay alert, review your security when you need to, take 
appropriate countermeasures where you can, and have a safe, 
secure and happy life.
164 Chapter 8  · Putting Things Into Perspective

Useful websites
Security is largely a question of awareness and common sense, so 
access to the Internet is not essential. However, the Internet does 
make a world of information available to everyone.
Some people may feel excluded because they do not have a home 
computer or advanced computer skills, but they are not necessary. 
You can use the Internet in coffee shops, libraries, colleges and 
schools and there is usually somebody available to show you 
how to use it too. By the time the average person has had a little 
practice, they usually say that they don’t know why they were so 
nervous in the first place!
Below I have listed some of the most useful Internet sites relevant 
to ensuring the security of your home.
Flooding Information Environment Agency
www.environment-agency.gov.uk Type in your postcode to 
identify the flooding risk for any location and property.
165

Crime statistics
www.crimestatistics.org.uk Allows you to check crime figures for 
a specific area. Some local authorities also hold information about 
crime rates and trends.
Stolen property searches
The police have their own database which is not available to the 
public, but there are also some databases that are available for the 
public to use.
www.trace.co.uk
www.virtualbumblebee.co.uk
Stopping unwanted mail, fax and phone 
advertising
If you want to try to stop, or at least reduce, the amount of 
unsolicited advertising you receive by mail, fax and telephone 
sent from UK organizations, visit the following specific sites to 
register your details. It will take a few months to work and isn’t 
guaranteed to stop all junk mail, but it helps.
www.fpsonline.org.uk Register your number and state that you 
do not want unsolicited fax advertising material.
www.mpsonline.org.uk Register your number and state that you 
do not want unsolicited mail advertising material.
www.tpsonline.org.uk Register your number and state that you 
do not want unsolicited telephone advertising material.
