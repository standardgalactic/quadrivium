What’s it all about?
1	 What’s it all about?
NLP is nothing more than the study of excellence. Many years ago, some people created a formal structure 
for extracting the intuitive talent that is deeply embedded within the minds of outstanding people. That 
talent can be refined and improved, and also taught to other people.
Think of someone who does something that you admire, and they make it look so easy. Ask them how 
they learned to do it and there’s a good chance that they will say, “I don’t know how, I just do it”. Whilst 
you can learn a lot from people like this, it usually takes a long time because they can’t explain how they 
are thinking. They think that everyone can do what they do.
NLP gives us a structure and a language for sharing intuitive knowledge. We can use it to model the 
expertise of anyone who excels at anything.
So, if you know someone who is an outstanding trainer, presenter, speaker, learner, teacher or just a 
fabulous person, you can use the NLP tool kit to model and copy their expertise.
The modelling process itself isn’t the subject of this handbook, as there are many other excellent books 
that will tell you about it. Many, many excellent communicators have already been modelled and their 
expertise is available to you through this handbook, which doesn’t require you to learn about NLP unless 
you want to and doesn’t require you to go on a training course and then figure it all out for yourself.
NLP can help you to unlock the potential in what you already do. As a successful, competent trainer you 
can become an outstanding, inspirational trainer. You don’t have to learn anything new to do that – you 
just refine and align the talents that are already within you.
This handbook is for anyone who wants access to the results that NLP will help them achieve, without 
having to spend a lot of time learning about NLP.
There are really two ways that you, as a teacher, coach, trainer, facilitator or learning enabler could acquire 
NLP skills. You could read one of the handful of books on the subject, which are built for length rather 
than comfort and assume you want to know everything there is to know about NLP.
Alternatively, you could go to a NLP Practitioner course and learn all about the fundamental principles 
of NLP. You would then have to apply these principles to the area of training yourself.
The principles that underpin NLP tools such as phobia cures are actually very useful in helping people 
learn, you just aren’t explicitly told how in any NLP training that I’ve ever seen, and I’ve seen quite a lot.

What’s it all about?
NLP in its purest form is all about personal excellence and is characterised by a curiosity about people 
and how they move through the world. NLP training will definitely help you become a more capable, 
effective person. It will help you to set goals, realise your dreams and communicate effectively with other 
people. If you think this is far-fetched, I suggest you don’t knock it until you’ve tried it. If you’ve tried it 
and hated it I will assume you’re not reading this book and I’m talking to myself.
On the whole, the people I’ve seen go through Practitioner training often describe it as a transformational 
experience.
Just don’t assume that everyone wants to be transformed.
After reading this you may decide that NLP is something you would like to learn more about. You may 
even decide to become a licensed NLP Practitioner. If this is the case then spend some time choosing a 
trainer who you are personally comfortable with, as the Practitioner course is a very personal experience. 
It is not a load of stuff to learn, it is an experience to work through and reflect upon. You will not be 
taught anything, but you will be given many opportunities to notice what is happening and learn from 
your own experience. You will, of course, learn about the tools and techniques of NLP, but these are 
only the results of NLP – they are not NLP in themselves.
NLP is full of jargon, and some of it is a bit unnecessary. There’s even a special word for “talking to 
myself”. This is not a book of NLP jargon. This is a book of plain language that I hope you will pick up 
and understand immediately. NLP was not created in a cave in Tibet, it was created by modelling real 
people like you. Therefore, you already know how to do everything that NLP can teach you. What you may 
not achieve right now is consistency, and this is the main area where people benefit from NLP training. 
There are many things that you do better than anyone else on the planet, and there are many things that 
someone else does better than you. By “better” I mean more easily and with more consistent results.
If you already have NLP experience then this handbook will give you some ready made applications for 
many of the things you will have learned about.
If you have no idea what NLP is then you can just take what’s in this book at face value, use it and get 
better results straight away. It really is that simple.

What’s it all about?
One more thing – this book is written in much the same way that I run training courses. Some information 
flows forwards, some flows backwards and some flows sideways. This way of layering information makes 
for very powerful, long term learning. You will find ideas or concepts hinted at and then explained in 
full later on. You may also find them explained in full first and then hinted at later. You may even find 
that some concepts assemble themselves out of pieces that turn up in different chapters. I ask you to 
take this book as a whole, as many of the chapters link together in different ways to form a complete 
learning experience. This book isn’t just about NLP; it is NLP – in action. You’ll find anchoring, hypnotic 
language and stories embedded in the words that are designed to create as lifelike a learning experience 
as you can get from a book.
Every book I’ve ever seen about NLP is just that – it describes NLP without letting you experience it. As 
you read this book, pay attention to any stray daydreams or ideas you get. Pay attention to the thoughts 
you have about the way you will apply what you are learning here. After you have read the whole book, 
you may find new connections being made. The book is a bit like a jigsaw puzzle, you need to see the 
whole thing in order to work out what the picture is. This isn’t done to be clever – it’s crafted to fully 
exploit your amazing, individual learning potential.
As you will already know, people learn in different ways. There are many different ways of putting 
learning styles into categories – maybe 4, 6, 8 or even 16 categories depending on which scheme you 
favour. Well, here’s the twist. In fact, there are around 6 billion different learning styles. Unfortunately, 
the amazing diversity of the human capacity for learning is a bit too complicated for the people who sell 
profiling tests, so they generalise that diversity into a handful of categories and force people into them 
based on a few symptoms.
Another way of looking at this is to see that ‘learning styles’ is really another term for ‘training styles’, 
so the purpose of categorising people is to make your life easier as a trainer, whether or not that’s right 
for your learners.
Thoughtful training providers will structure their delivery for different learning styles. Does this mean 
that you can only ever learn in one way? No! You can, and do, learn any way you like. Don’t let anyone 
stop you.
A book that incorporates learning styles could have some practical exercises for you, some theory, it 
could even have some blank pages for you to write your own thoughts on as you reflect on what you have 
read. This book, on the other hand, uses everything that we know today about powerful learning to help 
you take in information through this relatively limited medium. I’ve even tried out a few ideas, which, 
to the best of my knowledge, have never been tried before, anywhere. By using NLP as it’s explained, 
you get at least twice the opportunity to learn, whatever your preference.

What’s it all about?
So, why Skills for Learning and not Skills for Training or Skills for Trainers? The answer to that lies in 
the job that we do. I get very frustrated at the prevalence of training centres, resources for trainers and 
people who think that presenting is the same as training or teaching. When I use a training centre, the 
staff there focus on me and giving me what I need – boxes of pens, flipcharts, trainer packs, discounts etc.
This frustrates me because I want them to focus on giving my learners what they want. I’m providing a 
service to the people who are on the course and that’s who I want the centre managers to focus on too. 
I want a great learning environment, good food and refreshments, good accommodation and a room 
with a flexible layout. Recently I had to physically cut a power cable for an OHP out of a floor box in 
the centre of the room so that we didn’t trip over it. Obviously all trainers use OHPs in the centre of the 
room with delegates neatly arranged in quiet, studious rows.
Simply, the training industry revolves around making life easy for the trainer. I think we trainers shouldn’t 
mind working a little harder to make life easier for our learners!
I met someone recently who wanted all the courses run by a local college to have standardised presentation 
slides so that a stand-in trainer could run the course if the usual trainer was ill. This is a great idea to 
ensure delegates are not disappointed by unavoidable last minute mishaps, however the slides are not the 
course – the course is the learning experience, not the material. Don’t confuse a record of the trainer’s 
words with the learning experience itself.
Some people confuse the job of a trainer with that of a presenter, even though they are not the same. 
A presenter’s job is to transmit information – think of a TV or conference presenter, for example. A 
trainer’s job is to make sure that information gets into the delegates’ brains, stays there and transforms 
into behaviour.
So the most important person is the learner. They are doing all the hard work. What the trainer, teacher 
or coach does is facilitate that – make it easy for the learner to learn. That’s what this book is about.
The most important thing you can do after reading this book is…anything! Don’t read another book, 
don’t sit and ponder, go and do something. Start playing with what you’ve learned. Don’t try, or plan or 
plot – just play. Have fun, enjoy yourself, and your learners will enjoy themselves too.
Finally, this book is designed both as a short introduction to NLP for anyone with a professional interest 
in learning as well as an application guide for anyone more experienced in NLP.
Like any good cook book, NLP – Skills for Learning is at its best when you use the recipes to achieve 
something that will delight and entertain your friends, colleagues and learners, and push your own skills 
to new heights. Get ready to enjoy the results!

Things to look out for
2	 Things to look out for
I’ve summarised some of the key points in this handbook so that you can pick them out easily.
The exclamation mark is there to draw your attention to important points that may seem 
simple or obvious, yet by paying special attention to them you will learn more about 
yourself and other people and your skills will improve dramatically. It’s easy to overlook 
the obvious things in life, yet sometimes they hold hidden treasures.
So, if you see that symbol, just take a moment to think about the point as there may be relevance or 
importance in it that’s easy to take for granted or overlook.
Often, books give you a lot of information which is factually correct and informative, but which may 
not be related to your specific needs.
A “so what?” is a summary of the relevance of a key point for learning. If 
you’ve ever read something which seems very important but not obviously 
relevant you may have wanted to ask the author this question.

First things first
3	 First things first
What equipment do you have for gathering information about the world?
Obviously, I can’t hear you, so I’ll pretend you said “Your five senses!!”
And I’ll say “well done!”…sort of. In that there are more than five. Here are some of the senses that you 
have – there may be more as we find out more about neurology and the way that your brain handles 
sensory information that is outside of our conscious perception. Here are just a few of them….
Now, this might appear to be obvious, and therefore trivial, but it is in fact the most important thing 
you will learn today.
Why? Because we must now accept that all of the rich memories, ideas, thoughts, pictures, sounds, 
poems, songs and desires that are in your head got there by coming in through your senses. They didn’t 
appear mystically and they didn’t arrive through intuition.
You might think that this is obvious, but it has an important meaning for our communication. The colour 
green, the sound of a car horn and the smell of lemon juice are easy to think of in terms of sensory 
inputs. What about honesty, professionalism and danger? What do these mean in sensory terms? What 
exactly does honesty sound like?
Almost everything that is in your head got there through your senses. Therefore, your 
senses are what you use to represent memories to yourself.
You see, hear, feel, taste and smell memories using the same processing systems that 
allow you to gather real time information from the outside world.

Almost everything? Yes, except for certain instinctive knowledge that you were born with, such as how 
to breathe, beat your heart or swallow milk. If you remember that far back then you’ll know that it took 
you a while to learn how to regulate your body temperature and even longer to learn how to move, 
walk and speak.
Our senses are our only tool for interacting with the world, yet as we grow older we ignore sensory 
information more and more and replace it with ‘experience’ or what we ‘know’. It will help you a great deal 
to gather more information if you try and forget what you think you already know. Intuition is one way 
that you notice subtle sensory information that gets missed in the fog of all the stuff you ‘know’ about.
Intuition is not mystical. It is the magic of your brain working far faster and more powerfully than you 
could ever think possible. It is the product of the amazing ability of your brain to gather and process both 
real time and stored information and produce something new and remarkable in the blink of an eye.
Of course, you may be unconsciously aware of sensory information that is outside of our normal 
awareness, so this may also play a part in what we call “intuition”. For example, we have a sense of 
direction which, like in migrating birds, detects the Earth’s magnetic field.
So, if you thought intuition was great, the natural function of your brain is even more amazing! But this 
isn’t a book on neurology. It’s a book on the practical applications of this knowledge, so let’s get back 
to those senses.
Over the years, you have taken in vast amounts of sensory data and attached linguistic labels to it. We 
don’t fully understand this process, so as a consequence we can’t get computers to copy it. We can teach 
a computer to understand that an object is both a table and wood, but if we smash the table up the 
computer struggles to understand that whilst it’s still wood, it’s not a table any more.
In fact, we still can’t even get computers to recognise faces reliably. Whereas you can recognise someone 
you haven’t seen in years, a computer can’t even recognise the same person with a hat on. It’s not through 
a lack of computer power or programming skill – it’s because we don’t understand how the human mind 
does it.
I recently read a review of biometric security devices for computers which included retina scanners and 
fingerprint readers. The fingerprint reader could be fooled with a jelly baby. So, no matter how amazing 
you find modern technology, there is still nothing to touch the computer between your ears.

You may have heard that you have a left brain and a right brain, or that you have a conscious and an 
unconscious brain, or that you have different thinking modes, or that you have an inner eye. All of this 
may or may not be true, depending on how you look at it. The coloured tint in your spectacles gives you 
a certain view of the world which may or may not be different to everyone else’s.
You may be thinking, “I see the world clearly and objectively, so the fault must lie with other people”. 
Well, the bad news is that there is no objectivity.
Have you ever lost your car keys, only to find them right in front of you? Have you ever pushed a door 
that was clearly marked “PULL”?
Can you see the dots changing from white to grey to black as you look around the picture?
Do the horizontal lines appear curved or straight?
Have you ever heard someone say something totally different to what they actually said? Have you ever 
daydreamed? Have you ever dreamed at night?

Well, if you answered “Yes!” to any of those, where did that voice come from? Was it the one in your 
head? Don’t worry, we’ve all got one. Some of us have many, and they can come in very handy.
Here’s the first useful tip for you. It may not be directly related to training but I can guarantee it is a 
very useful thing to know about. In fact, if you ever feel nervous or if you ever worry, or if you ever tell 
yourself you should have known better, then this will be a very, very useful thing to know. Are you ready?
Did you know that you have total conscious control over that voice in your head?
Did you know that if it nags you or criticises you, you can change its tone of voice to be anything you 
want. If it sounded really soothing and supportive, would you be more inclined to listen to its advice?
If it sounded really excited and enthusiastic, how do you think you would feel? Try it out now…. In a 
really critical, harsh voice, say, “That was rubbish, you should have known better”. Next, use a really kind 
and supportive voice to say “Hey! That didn’t work so well, what can you do differently next time?” Pay 
attention to the difference in how you feel about those two voices.

First things first
You can change the qualities of the voice inside your head. You can make it sound 
supportive, you can make it sound like a newsreader, you can make it sound like a cartoon 
character. Any of these will change your emotional state and allow you to benefit from 
the feedback from your internal commentator. In fact, you can change the qualities of any 
of your sensory systems to change the emotional content of memories.
Just so you’re familiar with the NLP jargon, the voice inside your head is called your ‘Internal Dialogue’. 
Other people have taken the idea and renamed it “self talk” and a dozen other things. They all mean 
the same thing – talking to yourself using the voice that only you can hear inside your head. Of course, 
some people talk to themselves out loud, but it’s the same thing.
We code our experiences of the world into language, so words are far more than a simple communication 
medium – they are in themselves models of our experiences and our reality.
Therefore, talking to yourself, either inside or out loud, is an important aspect of the way that you 
understand your experiences, and getting learners to talk about their experiences is important in helping 
them to organise information and therefore learn new ideas and skills.
If you find that you criticise yourself when you get things wrong and that this makes you feel bad, just 
try this really simple exercise.
Next time you make a mistake and the voice says “that was stupid” or “that was a bad idea” say, in a 
genuinely curious way, “Thankyou! Now, how does that information help me?” You can try any variation 
on this, such as “Thank you! What do you suggest I do differently next time?” You will find that the results 
are quite different to when you just nag yourself. You can make up any form of words that are right for 
you as long as you follow the basic structure of “acknowledge value” then “redirect to a positive course 
of action”. You probably already apply this structure when other people offer you criticism – don’t you? 
It just helps bypass the emotion of criticism and get to the real value – the feedback.
You may say “but this doesn’t apply to me” in which case you should pay twice as much attention. When 
you’re in a learning environment, some people will beat themselves up for making “mistakes”. You’ll 
know when they do this from listening to what they say, for example “I told myself I should have known 
better” or “I said to myself that this was wrong”. When you hear this, you can constructively intervene 
by helping them change their internal dialogue.
So, what we know now is that everything you know is represented to you using one or more of your 
senses. For example, you ‘know’ the colour of your front door by seeing a picture of it. We also know 
that your senses may not be giving you the full picture, the whole story or a real handle on the situation. 
This is a very useful thing for you to know as a professional communicator (and who isn’t?)

OK, so I skipped about and covered quite a few subjects there, so to summarise:
The only way that you can gather information about the world is through your senses. As you get older 
and have more experiences, you filter your senses more and more and over time what you think you 
see, hear and feel about the world gets further away from reality. Often, this is a good thing and helps 
you to deal with the huge amount of sensory information that comes into your brain every moment of 
every day and night. Your biggest step forward as a professional communicator and learning enabler will 
be when you realise this and simply start paying more attention to what is outside than what is inside.
You could be amazed at the amount of information that is all around you if you take the trouble to 
pay attention. Instead of thinking that you know what other people are thinking or what their motives 
are – ask them! Instead of guessing, pay attention! Instead of knowing, forget and enjoy the experience 
of sampling the world through fresh eyes and ears.
On the radio today I heard an interviewee say, “There are no absolutes” and it made me smile. What, 
none at all? Not one? Not even one about there being no absolutes?
By listening to what people say, you will learn a great deal about the way that their internal world is 
organised. NLP training can teach you all the details of the Milton Model, the Meta Model, conversational 
postulates and unspecified nouns but the truth is that NLP came out of a set of beliefs from people who 
were gifted or talented communicators. They didn’t stop what they were doing and say to themselves 
“ooh…I should use a tag question next, shouldn’t I?” You don’t have to learn the way that this knowledge 
has been categorised and indexed, you only need to share their enthusiasm for learning more about 
other people.
When you went to school and learned about nouns and verbs, you didn’t start speaking differently – you 
simply acquired a new labelling system for what you already knew about. That labelling system only 
serves the purpose of letting two or more people share information using a common language.
All of the linguistic stuff in NLP is very powerful but you should regard it only as a framework to refine 
the way you already use language. You’ll be amazed at the way you already influence people. Recently, I 
was watching a training session where the teacher (it was in a school) was running an exercise in which 
groups of students had to build a model roller coaster using card stuck to a hardboard panel. As she 
gave out the first panel she said to the first group “Here’s your board” upon which one of the students 
collapsed, comatose, onto his folded arms on the table. The teacher shouted “Oi! Wake up, sit up straight, 
pay attention” and so on.
Well, what did she expect? If she insists on going round hypnotising people then she has to accept the 
results she gets.

Why?
Your brain uses context to derive the most likely meaning from similar sounding words. Whilst you 
extract the most contextually likely meaning at the conscious level, at the unconscious level you run 
through all possible meanings. If one of them is expressed as an instruction, there’s a good chance you 
will act upon it.
Having sat in a classroom all day, if someone said to you “You’re bored” then what meaning would you 
take from it?
In this example, the teacher needs to call her piece of hardboard a sheet, a base, a panel – just anything 
other than “board”!
Just think about the implications of this for a moment. Every day, all over the world, there are groups of 
important people shaping our future by meeting in “Board Rooms” Mind you, having sat through some 
bored meetings I think the name is very appropriate!

Taking it all in
4	 Taking it all in
The world we live in is a busy, busy place. In fact, the world has always been busy and there’s more 
information available than we can consciously attend to. I don’t mean information like news, TV etc. I 
mean sensory stimuli – things that you can see, hear, feel, taste and smell. Right now, you can see these 
words, you might also be reading to yourself using the voice in your head. You might also be aware 
of any background noise. Are you aware of the temperature of the air? How about the weight of your 
hands? How about that itch? Are you hungry? Thirsty? Tired?
You could think of your unconscious brain as your car’s engine management computer and your conscious 
brain as your car’s instrument panel. Normally, you don’t need to know what’s going on under the bonnet. 
If there’s a problem, a warning light comes on. You don’t need to know the status of every muscle in 
your body except for if there’s a problem in which case you get a pain. Another useful analogy is that 
your unconscious brain is a dark room and your conscious attention is a torch.
The unconscious brain is, of course, the same brain as your conscious brain. The conscious bit is everything 
that you are aware of, and that will change from one second to another. You might be so engrossed in 
this book that you are unaware of any background noise until I call your attention to it. At least, I hope 
you’re engrossed!

At any moment, you can attend to only a handful of thoughts. In NLP, these thoughts are called ‘chunks’ 
and refer to things like short term memory and activities. Try juggling and remembering a telephone 
number at the same time, and you’ll start to understand the limitations of your conscious attention. You 
already knew about breaking a task down into smaller chunks, and now you know how it works too.
In a driving example, this would be like practising gear changes until you could change gear without 
thinking about it – then move onto the next element. I believe that a really good way to learn something 
like driving would be to run through specific behavioural sequences until they become one “chunk” of 
information. For example, changing gear and working the clutch pedal at the same time is very difficult to 
start off with, although the motor movement in your arm and leg is not very complex. If that movement 
was already “natural” when you first got into a car, putting together the individual movements and patterns 
would be a lot easier than trying to learn it all at the same time, under pressure. Driving simulators are 
a huge step forward as they remove the pressure and allow the learner to practice the basics.
People will often find it very difficult to learn a new skill, simply because the 
volume of sensory information being presented overwhelms their conscious 
processing power. They don’t have a ‘frame of reference’ for what they’re 
learning, so all they can do is compare new information to what they already 
know. Break the task down and build the learning experience in layers. You 
could break it down by sensory system, i.e. start by watching, then hearing, 
then feeling. You could also break it down by time, so either start slowly and 
speed up, or break apart the components of the activity that normally take 
place at the same time. At all times, position new information in the context 
of what the learners already know and are familiar with.
Your ability to focus your attention is both a gift and a drawback, depending on the activity you’re trying 
to master. If you are training people to remember something complex, they will simply be unable to 
process everything that is happening. For an experienced driver, the whole business of driving is mostly 
under unconscious control so an experienced driver can drive and hold a conversation at the same time. 
A learner driver needs to attend consciously to every individual component of operating a car, and there 
is simply too much going on. If the learner is also trying to attend to feelings of stress, hunger or thirst, 
the conscious brain will simply be overloaded and they will not learn anything at all. For an experienced 
driver, “change gear” is one chunk. For a learner, it is about six.
You may have heard that words only make up part of communication. According to the social 
psychologists Mehrabian and Argyle, words only make up 7% of communication. Whether you agree 
with the figure or not, we can at least agree that words are not the only form of communication and 
that there are times when words are misleading when taken in the overall context of communication.

Do you know when someone is lying? How? Well, if you don’t already know then I’ll tell you. Your brain 
is analysing all forms of communication while consciously you are attending mostly to the words. Your 
brain compares the content – the words – to facial expression, body posture, voice pitch, speech rate, 
volume, stability etc. and finds that the two don’t match up. Your brain alerts you to this through a ‘gut 
feeling’ or an instinctive reaction – you can call it intuition if you want to. You might say something 
like “Something he said didn’t ring true” or “I don’t like the look of him” or even “it was written all over 
his face”.
When we take in information, we filter it to allow our conscious attention to focus on what seems 
relevant. The process of filtering works in three different ways, so that we delete, distort and generalise 
incoming information.
So, when communicating with a group of people, it’s important to remember that they are all gathering 
information differently to each other and to you. They will only be attending to a small part of the 
information you give them. The more ways that you can deliver the same information, the more chance 
there is that they will find something of value to them, process it and remember it.

If lunchtime is approaching, people are not listening to you regardless of the value of the information 
you are trying to impart. You may use this knowledge to communicate directly with their unconscious 
minds, but you’re probably better off taking an early lunch. Longer break times do not equate to less 
learning. Some people need time to reflect on what they are learning, otherwise they are not able to form 
long term connections with the new material. Longer breaks allow these people more time to reflect and 
absorb what they are learning. Whatever you do, people will find a meaning in it.
Years and years ago, I gave my first big, formal presentation at a conference. I stood on a stage, behind 
a lectern and in the glare of a spotlight. There was a big screen behind me with someone working the 
back projector when I pressed a button. I wanted it to go really well, so I wrote myself a script. The only 
problem was that halfway through the presentation I lost my place and read the same paragraph twice. 
Filled with dread, I finished my presentation just before a break.
Over coffee, a colleague of mine told me that the presentation had gone well to which I replied “Oh no! 
It was terrible, I read the same paragraph twice and it was awful”. My colleague said, “Oh, I thought 
you did that because it was a really important bit”. In fact, one person in the audience who was getting 
a little sleepy after lunch even thought I was talking just to him to wake him up!

It just goes to show that even with the best planning in the world, people will infer any meaning they 
choose regardless of what you do. The frame of reference that you create has a far bigger impact on this 
meaning than anything else you do. Because I was on stage, I took on the role of an expert who must 
plan methodically and have a reason for everything. People found meanings that fitted their frame of 
reference.
Of course, some people thought “he just repeated that, he must be nervous” but the important thing is 
that nobody cared except for me. People have an interesting way of inferring meaning from everything 
you do, and it’s usually much kinder than the meaning you attach.
Setting the frame of reference at the start is the single most important step you can take 
in creating powerful learning, as the audience will search for meanings that are relevant 
within that frame. After this point, anything that you do, within reason, will reinforce the 
learning.
This goes much further than “tell them what you’re going to tell them”. If you start by setting the agenda, 
people in the audience will immediately run through it ahead of you, decide what they are going to pay 
attention to and then switch off. It’s important that you make the agenda loose enough that the audience 
cannot decide by themselves what is important. In fact, an agenda written from a pure learning point 
of view might be:
1.	 Introductions
2.	 Learn some great stuff
3.	 Break
4.	 Learn more great stuff
5.	 Lunch
6.	 Learn amazing stuff
7.	 Break
8.	 Amaze yourselves at what you’ve learned
9.	 Close
That might be taking the idea a bit far, but remember that an agenda is just a summary of what the 
presentation contains. As people gather information, they compress it down, make it less complicated 
and forget most of it. By starting with an explicit agenda, you have already summarised your entire 
course onto one slide and many people will stop learning at that point.
If you absolutely must use an agenda, then at least make it sound interesting. Tell people what they will 
be able to do, rather than what you will talk about.

Personally, I can’t think of a situation where you really need an agenda. You might think that you at least 
need to tell people break times. If you do, they’ll be clock watching and thinking about the telephone 
calls they need to make.
You’ll find that some people are desperate to be told what they’re going to learn about, and you now 
know many ways to handle this effectively.
Instead, you can tell people that there will be short, regular breaks with more than enough time to attend 
to matters outside of the presentation room. Take breaks, not because the agenda says so but because you 
and the audience need them. Some training environments are so good you don’t need to take a break 
all day long. Others are so bad that you need a break every half hour. Leave yourself the flexibility you 
need to keep your audience in a great learning state.
If you don’t agree break times up front, people will not come back on time, will they? Well, some people 
will be late back whatever you do. I suggest you deal with this when you set the frame at the start of 
the session.
Try something like “We’re going to take regular short breaks throughout the day and each time we take 
a break I will tell you the time that I will restart. If you’re not back in the room at that time I will assume 
that, at that moment, you have something important that you need to do and that’s OK with me. I would 
rather you take care of important matters when you need to so that when we are in this room together, 
we can all concentrate fully on what we are learning here.”
So, bear in mind that people have a limited focus of attention. I read somewhere that young children can 
concentrate for about five minutes, and that this attention span gets longer as we get older. Personally, I 
don’t think this ever changes. Instead, adults just devise ingenious strategies for appearing to pay attention 
when in fact they’re thinking about something else.
Be honest, how long have you spent reading since you were last distracted?
So, you can get upset when people don’t pay attention, or you can accept it as entirely normal and work 
with it, using it to your advantage to get better results with your learners.

Now that we’ve covered some background, we can move into some even more useful, practical stuff. 
Whenever you set out to do anything – read a book, deliver a presentation, go to a meeting, relax or 
go to sleep, you probably have a routine for getting yourself into the right frame of mind. Perhaps you 
start to do something important and then postpone it because there are other things on your mind that 
you need to attend to first.
Being in the right state is the first and most important step in achieving anything. This doesn’t mean 
that you should be happy all the time, as those emotions we often label as “negative” can be just as useful 
for achieving certain outcomes. The point is that you choose the emotional state which will get you the 
best results, not that you choose the best emotional state.
Really effective people are very good at choosing states, moving into them quickly and exploiting their 
power. Every state, from anger through to apathy, has a purpose and the potential to help you achieve your 
chosen outcome. Of course, that implies that you have a chosen outcome, which we’ll come onto later.
Suffice to say that really effective people naturally decide what it is they want and choose their outcomes 
very well. They go on to achieve those outcomes more often than the average man in the street, too.
There are essentially two ways to quickly change your emotional and mental state – changing your focus 
of attention and changing your physiology. Later on, there are some quick exercises that you can use to 
control focus of attention for yourself and your learners. You can even set a trigger for a state, giving 
you fast and easy access to it in future.
For now, we’ll stick to physiology as it’s really simple, really powerful and really easy to ignore. If you are 
alert and have plenty of water and oxygen, you will feel energetic and perform well. If you are lacking in 
any basic physiological needs such as sleep and light, you will perform below your best.
Hmmm…. Well, there’s nothing new there. In fact, this isn’t even NLP, but it’s worth saying anyway. In 
fact, there is some NLP in here – once you get into rapport with your audience, you will affect each other’s 
states. If you get tired after lunch, they will. If they get bored, you will. It’s worth practising getting out 
of rapport with people and finding a way to alert yourself to the onset of tiredness, because we usually 
don’t notice until it’s too late.
Getting the right physiology for learning is the first thing you can do to improve the state of your 
learners. In a warm, cramped room with no natural light, you’ll be lucky to keep your learners awake, 
let alone in a learning state.

State
In a room with lots of fresh air, light and water, even an average presenter can keep the audience in an 
attentive state. There is absolutely no good reason for making life hard for yourself, so get the environment 
right first before you think about anything else.
Aside from this, there isn’t a right learning environment, and there isn’t a right colour for learning. 
Rather than trying to second guess the needs and preferences of your audience, go for a venue that you 
feel comfortable in, so that you’re relaxed and your confident state can rub off on your audience.
You can design exercises that require people to physically move in order to complete them. I don’t 
mean building steam engines out of tin cans or struggling with radioactive waste, I mean standing up 
and moving around, going to other rooms and talking. You can build a physical version of any exercise 
that you set your group, and in doing so you achieve two aims; the original aim of the exercise and the 
aim of giving the group a break and an energy boost. Getting people to change their physical posture 
periodically is a great way for you to manage their learning state.

People who are very good at getting what they want are very good at understanding a simple secret 
to success. Here it is – you are more likely to get what you want if you know what you want. These 
people are very good at setting goals for themselves in a special way which programs the brain to notice 
opportunities automatically.
Knowing what you want makes it far easier to achieve. Successful people know this 
intuitively and use a simple formula to turn their goals into reality. You can copy this 
formula to get the results you want.
Later on, there’s a formula you can use for setting goals that makes them easier to achieve. It’s quite 
obvious really, the goal has to be something you want rather than something you don’t want, you need 
to know exactly what it will look, sound, feel, taste and smell like, and achieving the goal needs to be 
good for you with no unwanted side effects.
You could remember the formula this way:
Positive
Under your control
Real (you can see, hear, feel, taste & smell it)
Ecological (no side effects)
You can use this simple formula in a number of ways to help people learn effectively. Sometimes, we 
learn by planning what we’re going to learn and sometimes we learn spontaneously.
Often, the purpose of learning is inferred by the course title. Since the course title usually reflects the 
needs of the learner, it can sometimes create confusion because it describes the problem rather than 
the solution. I recommend you create course titles that reflect what learners will be able to do, rather 
than the problem you are helping them solve. In reality, a good title or headline would have both in it.

Some time ago, we did some work with a group of trainers who specialised in stress management. Their 
problem was that delegates would often be disruptive and uncooperative and they found it difficult to hold 
the course together. The first thing that jumped out was the title of the course – “Stress Management”. 
It’s a very common title for that type of course, but it describes the problem. When you add in the fact 
that many people on the course had been “sent” by their managers, the meaning became “You’re stressed 
and you’re not managing it”. No wonder some people were reluctant to take part, as the problem was not 
necessarily their ability to manage their state but perhaps more to do with the workload imposed by the 
boss. The manager was effectively saying “I don’t like you getting upset when I pile more work on you”. 
Did the staff need a stress management course, or does the manager need a time management course?
Instead of Stress Management, how about State Management? A bit vague. Instead of just letting people 
manage stress, how about having them grab it by the horns? Stress Control? Stress Engineering? How 
about having a Stress Rodeo? Yee-Haa! Ride that stress! It certainly creates a different expectation, and 
that’s what is important.
Now I do understand that there are good reasons for naming a training program after the problem 
that the training addresses, so that learners know what to look for. On the other hand, this will attract 
learners who have already decided what their problem is and therefore what the solution is. Alternatively, 
it will attract learners whose managers have determined this for them. If you ever have a problem with 
learners who have been sent against their will, then this could be a contributing factor. I know that 
some corporate trainers call these people ‘hostages’ which of course presupposes that they are being 
held against their will, and you know that they are free to leave whenever they like. In fact, they would 
learn more by knowing that they were free to leave whenever they like, because then they are making 
a free choice to participate.
Just imagine for a moment that you are having a hard time at work, and you have asked your manager 
for support a number of times, so he or she has decided that you need to go on a training course. Just 
spend a moment considering how you would feel if your manager told you that he or she had booked 
you onto any of these courses:
• Stress Management
• Time Management
• Skill With People
• Effective Meetings
• Handling Difficult People
• How to be a Better Colleague
• Plan Your Next Career Move

What did you imagine that these courses said about you? What did you imagine the other learners on 
the course being like? How did you imagine feeling during the training course?
A key factor in what we might call accelerated learning is individuality. If you have training content 
where uniformity is important such as Health and Safety or regulatory training, it’s important that you 
use what you know about outcomes to set the frame of reference and tell people what they are going to 
do with their new knowledge.
If your training topic is more open, you can have the audience create individual learning outcomes which 
will define individual frames of reference. They are then far more likely to learn something which is 
useful and relevant to them and which transfers easily back to the workplace.
If you are doing something with personal development, it can be useful to run through the well formed 
outcomes exercise at the start of the course, using their own learning objectives as an exercise topic. 
This will force them to create learning objectives if they didn’t already have them, and they will achieve 
those objectives as the course progresses.
If you want to use this same tool in a more indirect way, you can use a feedback form that the delegates 
fill in at the start of the course.

Here’s an example that I use. I tell the course delegates that since I’m sure they want to rush away at the 
end of the course we’ll fill in the feedback form at the start to save time later.
What do you want to get out of this workshop?
What can you see yourself doing differently as a result of this 
workshop?
What one thing will you tell your friends that you enjoyed most 
about the workshop?
What do you want to learn from this workshop?
How will you know when you’ve learned it?
What will having learned that do for you?
When will be your first chance to practice what you’ve learned?
What difference will other people notice in you?
Actually, here’s an important point about real feedback forms – I often get delegates to fill them in during 
lunchtime or afternoon break because they have really seen all they need to – the course isn’t going to 
get any better from that point on! And then they’re in a much better state to give high quality feedback 
rather than rushing through the form because they want to get away.
The feedback form I use at the start of a course is essentially a future pace (a kind of vivid daydream 
about the future) that is written with presuppositions about the way that delegates will transfer and 
apply what they’ve learned. It allows learners to build on their own experience and thereby get the 
most complete, useful learning experience possible. The questions set a direction for their learning by 
drawing their attention to the personal value of the learning before they learn it rather than afterwards. 
Remember the sensory filters that we talked about earlier on? If you wait until the end of the course or 
the practice exercise to tell ask what they noticed, they will already have filtered out. If you want them just 
to notice whatever they notice, and that’s the point of the exercise, or perhaps you want to demonstrate 
how different people have naturally noticed different things, then leave the outcome as wide open as 
possible, and make that the specific outcome for the exercise. You know that learners will often try to 
second guess the point of the exercise in order to get it right, so pre-empt that.
A presupposition is a very special linguistic tool in NLP that works on the basis that we process language 
by holding certain concepts as true in order to make sense of the words.
The neat thing about a presupposition is that by the time the listener hears it, it’s already too late. A 
presupposition is not a NLP invention – it’s a grammatical concept. It’s what must be true in order for 
the language to make sense.

Later on, you’ll read about something called “well formed outcomes”, which is essentially a way to program 
your brain to notice opportunities for you to achieve your goals. You can use the outcomes exercise as 
it is, as it’s a really useful thing for a delegate to take away from any training course. Alternatively, you 
can build the concept and language of the exercise into anything you do.
For example, you can ask delegates how they see themselves using what they’ve learned, or you can ask 
them what they see as they use what they’ve learned. Whilst these sound the same, they in fact generate 
completely different internal mental processes.
For example, asking them what other people will notice forces them to imagine something changing, 
which in turn creates the possibility for change. They may or may not change, what’s important is that 
they are more open minded.
What’s really important is that you prepare your delegates for an outstanding learning experience, and 
the simplest way to do this is to tell them to expect just that!

You already know what rapport is. It’s that thing you have with people you like, when you’re on the same 
wavelength, see eye to eye and feel a real connection with them.
You can think of rapport as being a conduit for communication. Without it, it’s very difficult to engage 
the processes of agreement and compliance, and you have to work harder to be understood. When you 
have rapport you can take a lot of shortcuts, such as asking a close friend to pass you “the thing”, and 
expecting that they’ll know you meant the TV remote control.
Let’s make a useful assumption: you already have rapport, so there’s nothing you need to do to create it. 
From the moment you walk into a room, you are already connected with the people in there.
Some of them will be connected with the real you, some of them will be connected with their own mental 
models of what a trainer is like – their previous experience. And sometimes that previous experience will 
be helpful to you, and sometimes not, so there are certainly times when you don’t want to be in rapport 
with other people, so that you can avoid being drawn into their hallucinations.

Rapport
If someone is reacting to you in an odd way before you have really started, the chances are they are 
reacting not to you but to their own expectation, so that’s a good time to stop and find out what is really 
going on.
Assuming that you’re a naturally likeable and gregarious person, there are still many things that people 
do to stifle natural rapport.
The most common in training and presenting seems to be the placing of barriers between the audience 
and the speaker. A lectern blocks the audience’s view of the speaker and restricts the flow of non-verbal 
information. Without rapport, the audience loses interest, the speaker gets nervous and the relationship 
descends in a spiral of infectious states.
The first and most important thing is to be in rapport with yourself. Self doubt and confusion lead to 
incongruence that the audience will pick up on instantly. They may not recognise it consciously but they 
will still find it hard to accept what you say. When you’re in an incongruent state, you’re more likely to 
generate confusion and doubt in the audience. You may choose to do this, in which case incongruence 
is a very useful tool.
If there’s one simple thing you can learn about rapport, it’s that you can choose the people you want to 
get into rapport with. If you feel that a salesman is being a bit too persuasive, or that someone secretly 
disagrees with you, even though they say differently, then it’s worth having a quick check of your state 
to see what’s going on.

You have probably heard of “body language” as devised by Allan Pease in the 1970s. Personally, I think 
that this came from an era where psychologists thought that people’s behaviour could be neatly packaged 
and explained with clear cause and effect. For example, if you put your hands behind your head, you’re 
being arrogant. I think that the idea of body language is helpful in that it gets people to think of their 
physical state as a means of communication, but it’s not helpful to think of specific gestures as having 
specific meanings.
I believe that Pease’s basic premise is that some gestures have some socially learned basis, such as the 
‘thumbs up’, whilst others are unique to the individual. Therefore, a lazy communicator could learn 
to recognise generic gestures in order to understand non-verbal communication. Of course, it’s more 
accurate to say that everyone understands non-verbal communication because it’s not separate from 
verbal communication – it’s all part of the same information flow.
As a brief aside, I should add that as of the time of writing, Pease’s speculations about body language 
(we can’t really call his work research) have been discredited in a number of studies (see New Scientist, 
6th April 2013).

Therefore, we all understand non-verbal communication, but we are consciously aware of its meaning to 
different levels. At one end of the spectrum, some people need a slap in the face to pick up on unspoken 
information, whilst people at the other end of the spectrum are now said to have a high EQ, or Emotional 
Intelligence quotient. Whilst you may or may not believe in EI, there’s no doubt it has helped revive 
interest in good old fashioned people skills.
You’ve probably heard about sales training courses where people are taught to “match” or “mirror” the 
way that their customers stand or sit in order to get into rapport. There are certainly some interesting 
things you can learn from doing this, and there are a few rapport exercises at the end of this handbook 
that you can play with, but personally I don’t recommend you actually do this in real life, because it will 
happen naturally if it is going to happen at all.
Personally, I think it’s a bit contrived to adjust your “body language” to get into rapport with people. 
If you get on with someone, you’ll be in rapport with them. If you’re not in rapport, there’s probably a 
reason for that and you should pay attention to what it is.
It’s worth having a play with rapport, and paying particular attention to the way that it influences 
communication. If you’re out shopping and you see someone selling something like double glazing, 
stop and watch – from a safe distance! Watch how the level of rapport influences the conversation and 
shows you how good a job the sales person is doing. In particular, watch the intricate dance that ensues 
when a sales person is trying to match the body posture of a customer who doesn’t want to be matched.
Think about times when you would want to break rapport. You can do this very subtly by just breaking 
eye contact for a moment, and the effect can be dramatic. You can quieten someone who rambles on 
in a training course very quickly, and without anyone noticing simply by building rapport and then 
breaking eye contact for a moment, and using the slight pause to regain control of the discussion. As 
long as you keep moving, the person won’t notice and you will protect the relationship that you have 
developed with them.
For you to be interested in NLP, you may already think of yourself as a “people watcher”. Well, don’t 
just watch, watch and learn! Notice patterns, sequences and connections in relationships and – most 
importantly – put what you’ve learned into practice.

I’m going to tell you what really effective communicators do to make their listeners sit up and pay 
attention. I’m going to tell you what they do to ensure their listeners respond as they are intended to. 
And you’ll be surprised at how obvious it is.
Really effective communicators plan their communication.
That’s it? Yes, but that doesn’t mean that they sit down and write a script, it means they tell their audience 
what they are supposed to do with the communication. Here’s an example. I’m going to ask you a 
question. In a moment, I want you to make a choice. Here’s something you need to decide on. You may 
have found that paragraph a little confusing, as it directed your attention in many different directions 
without closing any of the opening statements.
Before you say what you want to say, tell your audience what you want them to do. This is really just 
another way of directing people’s attention, and it’s very effective for managing the way people respond 
to what you say.
Here are a few more examples of this simple yet effective tool:
“I’m going to ask you a question now that I want you to think very carefully about before you answer”
“In a moment, I’m going to ask you to stand up”
“Here’s a really important point for you to consider”
“This is what I want you to do”
“Before you fill out your feedback forms, I’m going to ask you a question”
“When we get back from lunch, I’m going to have you do some really creative group work”
“Before you finish reading your handbook, I would like you to think of at least three new ways you’ll 
use all the great stuff you’re learning.”

Plan your planning
If you tie this simple concept in with the goal setting exercises that you’ll read about later on, you will 
quickly become a very powerful and congruent communicator, because the people you speak to will 
be able to understand easily and quickly what you want from them. It may be agreement, it may be 
an answer, or it may just be their attention. Whatever you want, you’re more likely to get it if you tell 
people what it is!
In organisations, people often launch into transmission mode during meetings and then wonder why 
their colleagues pull their project updates apart. Sometimes, decisions go round in circles forever and 
never quite get made. We have come to learn what to expect from meetings, and if you are invited to a 
meeting then there may be an implicit expectation that you’ll contribute. Meetings everywhere would be 
far more productive if people applied this simple principle. For example, saying “Here is an update on 
my project, I don’t need any advice or feedback at this stage, it’s for your information only” tells people 
exactly what is expected of them. Conversely, presenting a huge volume of facts and figures and only 
then asking people to make a decision is simply asking for trouble. If you tell people up front what you 
expect, they will pay attention in the right places and be able to make a decision when you need them 
to, instead of saying they need more time to think.
So, this is what I’m asking you to do. Whenever you want a specific response to what you tell people, 
first tell them what you want them to do.

Four steps to learning
9	 Four steps to learning
Often, people who are experienced at something are called upon to train people who are inexperienced. 
This is often a terrible idea, for a very simple reason.
Whenever we learn something new, particularly a physical task, we go through four well known stages. I’ve 
often read descriptions of them, but no one has ever explained why they are so important for knowledge 
transfer before. Here are those four stages:
So, when learning a new skill you start by not even knowing that you can’t do it, because you don’t know 
it exists to be done. Then, you realise that you can’t do it. As you start to learn it, you know that you can 
do it and you have to concentrate to do it well. Finally, the skill becomes deeply embedded and you can 
do it well without thinking about it.
Think back to when you learned to ride a bicycle or drive a car and think about how you progressed 
through these stages.
Did your father, or another friend or relative, try to teach you to drive? Was it the same as having a 
proper driving instructor? Many experienced drivers have forgotten how they learned to drive, so they 
try to describe what they are doing. This is not the same as describing how they are thinking.
People who are skilled at a certain task are often the worst people to train 
others to perform that task. They have become unconsciously competent 
so they are only able to pass on the information that they have conscious 
access to, which is only part of the knowledge required for the task or 
skill. As a minimum, someone who is trained to model the skill and then 
structure the learning experience should facilitate the session.
By describing how they drive, they are offering a very limited part of their already limited representation 
of the world. They are often very good at telling the learner what not to do but are less able to identify 
what should be done instead.

Four steps to learning
Of course, not all professional driving instructors are perfect, but their focus is on learning to drive, 
not knowing how to drive. By focussing on the transition from not knowing to knowing they are able 
to convey that information more effectively than someone who knows how to drive, but doesn’t know 
how they know.
Humans are very flexible and adaptable and are able to learn many more skills than they need to 
complete any given task. They always have more knowledge than is necessary and they are therefore able 
to improvise or respond to changes easily. The people in your audience will always have more relevant 
experience than they give themselves credit for, and you can exploit this to your advantage. By drawing 
out what is already within them, you will be blamed for their transformational learning experiences. 
You don’t need to be an expert in the course material, just an expert in curiosity.
I suspect that you already know this, and that you already draw on learners’ experiences a great deal. 
The key here is that your learners not only know more than you might think, they actually know a great 
deal more than they think because they just don’t have conscious access to the majority of what they 
“know”. When you start to hear those hallmark phrases that reveal a talent, such as “I don’t know, I just 
do it” or “Doesn’t everyone do that?” then spend a little time digging deeper, as you are about to hit gold.
One of the other consequences of this model of learning is that in order for someone to become better 
at something they can already do.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations.

Logical levels
9	 Logical levels
Perhaps you remember sets and Venn diagrams from school. Set theory is a way of categorising elements 
into groups to make logical calculations easier.
Here, you can see that two girls are musicians and three aren’t. One boy is a musician and four aren’t. 
Not surprisingly, there are no musicians that are both a girl and a boy and there are no musicians that 
are neither a girl nor a boy. This is a visual representation of a series of logical expressions which include:
Boy AND Musician = 1
Girl AND Musician = 2
Girl OR Musician = 5
Boy OR Girl = 10
Boy AND Girl = 0
Which is easier for you to understand? If you just want a single piece of information, it might be easier 
to read it from a table or spreadsheet. If you want to see the whole situation, the big picture, then the 
diagram might be easier. Different methods of coding information are useful at different times and for 
different purposes. Human spoken language is one way of coding information, but it’s not the only one.
Here’s a way of visually coding hierarchies of information:

Logical levels
You can see that “cow” falls into the category “farm animals” and that “Jersey” falls into the category “cow”. 
I’m afraid I’m not an expert on cows so some of them may not be farm animals in the strictest sense.
As you might expect, someone used this logical approach to categorise language too. Whenever we make 
statements about ourselves, our beliefs, our values, our rules and our needs we use language that falls 
neatly into levels of abstraction.
With language that relates to ourselves, the categories are:
Identity
Me, who I am
Beliefs
What is true about the world, my values, 
my rules
Capabilities
What I can do, everything that I know 
about
Behaviour
What I am doing right now
Environment
Where I am, the people around me, the 
world I live in
You might have heard these categories described as ‘logical levels’, which is a contentious subject in NLP.
Here’s another example, using the language of “limiting beliefs”. You may have read about limiting beliefs 
as being ideas that you hold as true which will hold you back and prevent you from succeeding, and the 
only thing that makes them true is that you believe they’re true.
Identity
I’m not a teacher
Beliefs
I could never be a really good teacher
Capabilities
I can’t teach
Behaviour
I’m not going to teach
Environment
I’m not teaching this subject
If we turn the above examples into positive statements, we get:
Identity
I’m a teacher
Beliefs
I could be a really good teacher
Capabilities
I can teach
Behaviour
I’m going to teach
Environment
I’ll be teaching this subject
Remember, positive doesn’t mean good, it just means something that exists or is not negated.

Logical levels
Remember also that limiting beliefs don’t limit you – they represent a choice that you make to not do 
something. All beliefs are limiting, if we think in that way, because all beliefs constrain what is possible.
Very often, and in today’s language of life coaching, people will say, “I want to change careers, but I have 
a limiting belief that stops me from leaving my job”. The notion of a limiting belief is nice on paper, 
and it should stay there, because ideas do not limit you. Why not? Because to allow your own ideas and 
beliefs to limit you makes you passive, and therefore powerless to do something different.
Isn’t it better to choose what you’re doing rather than blame your own beliefs for not having done it?
When you want to communicate effectively with someone, especially in 
a facilitation or conflict situation, you will get better results by using your 
knowledge of logical levels. If someone says “I can’t do this” then you can 
choose to stay at the same level (Yes you can, what can you do?) or you can 
move up a level (I know you will be able to do it) or down a level (What are 
you doing now?)
By identifying the logical level in language, you are able to determine how a 
person is structuring their thinking.

Logical levels
Here’s a recent example from a NLP Practitioner course. On the subject of goals, one delegate said that 
his goal is “I want to be able to paint”. Notice how this differs from “I want to paint” or “I want to paint 
people”. He is asking for the skill, the capability – he may not actually do any painting. Of course, we 
can say that he already can paint, it just doesn’t turn out how he’d like it to. You can use this structure to 
understand and clarify the problem, so that you’re working at the most appropriate level to effect change.
When people talk about problems and in particular when they talk about things they can’t do, you can 
use your knowledge of logical levels to either constrain their thinking within the problem or open their 
mind up to generate new ideas. Remember, if you address the stated problem directly you are saying, 
“Yes, I agree that you have this problem”. In fact, that’s so important I think we’ll have a box:
If you address the stated problem directly you are acknowledging and accepting the 
problem as real. Always move to a more useful position first before looking back to the 
problem if you need to. Many problems will disappear immediately as a result of directing 
your thoughts to the desired outcome. Any lingering problems are much easier to handle 
from a position of knowing the problem can be solved.
For example, if someone says “I want to be able to paint” and you respond with “How have you tried to 
learn?” then you are non-verbally saying, “You’re right. You can’t paint”. A more useful response might 
be “So when you paint now, how does it look?” Oddly enough, this person had a particular problem 
with visualisation, so it’s no wonder that he couldn’t see her internal pictures clearly enough to transfer 
them onto paper. By the way, that’s effectively what creative drawing is. You imagine a picture on the 
paper, and then you draw round it with a pencil.
If you choose to remain at the same level, you will constrain your thoughts within the problem. You 
will probably not generate any new ideas at this level, as the problem itself sets the boundaries for the 
solution. However, you may want this to happen, so it may not be a bad thing.
If you move up a level, you are able to think about other examples of this problem, and you will have 
better access to similar experiences to draw from. You will have better access to your skills by moving 
to a higher level than the problem.
If you move down a level, you will move from thinking to doing, you will increase the chances of taking 
action. You will start to motivate other people to take action.
Here are some examples of questions you can use to clarify problem statements:

Logical levels
“I’m not a xyz”
“What are you, then?”
“I’m not a xyz”
“What can someone who isn’t a xyz do?”
“I’m no good at this”
“What are you good at?”
“I’m no good at this”
“What sort of person would be?”
“I’m no good at this”
“What else can you do?”
“I can’t learn this”
“What makes you say that?”
“I can’t learn this”
“What are you learning?”
“I can’t learn this”
“What can you learn?”
“I’m not doing that”
“What can you do?”
“I’m not doing that”
“What will you do?”
“I’m not doing that”
“Where could you do that?”
“I’m not doing that here”
“Where will you do it?”
“I’m not doing that here”
“What will you do here?”
It’s no coincidence that every response to these examples is a question. Remember, the person speaking 
these phrases is operating from an incomplete map of the world. They do not have an internal 
representation of the world that is complete – and neither do you!
This can come as a surprise to many people who have built their reputation on being right and on knowing 
everything. This is not a sign of arrogance or self-importance, it is merely a reflection of the situation 
that society puts trainers and teachers into. As a trainer, you are expected to have all the answers when 
it is generally more useful to have all the questions.
So, historically, the job of a teacher is to pass his or her map on to others. Fortunately for us, the role 
of the teacher or trainer is changing and becoming more like a facilitator or coach, helping students to 
learn for themselves.
So, your job is not to give the complete map to them, as you are only giving them your map and that 
is only useful to you. Your job is to help them recover the missing pieces of their own map. Consider, 
using each of the questions above, how the likely answers differ to what would happen if you just said 
“why not?”
You will not help people by giving them your internal map, as it is only useful to you. Your 
job is to help them enrich their own map, and the way to do that is to ask them questions 
about the missing pieces.

Since you have no way to know how someone else structures their experience of the world, you have 
no way of knowing what parts are missing from their map. What may seem like missing information 
may in fact be a different way of organising that information to you. You may have experienced talking 
to someone who “just won’t be told” and now you know why!
We’ll leave logical levels in peace for now, as they will pop up again later on.

Language represents a tiny part of the experience that every person has in their head. Language does 
not convey experience – it summarises it. When someone makes a statement like “I can’t learn this”, you 
can ask yourself “what must their experience be, in order for this statement to be true”.
Often, people do or say things that don’t make sense to you. Every behaviour makes 
complete sense for the person concerned. Your job is not to judge based on your map, it 
is to ask yourself “what must this person believe, think or need for this behaviour to be the 
best choice available?”
To understand someone, you must enter their world, not stand on the edge of your own 
and pass judgement.
By doing this, you are gaining a glimpse into their internal world. You must not be tempted to fill in the 
gaps you perceive in their experience. You must help them recover lost information themselves, not give 
it to them on a plate. If you responded to “I can’t learn this” with “Yes you can, because other people 
are!” then you are giving them your experience, not helping them to expand their own.
Giving someone a piece of your map – “a piece of your mind” – is pointless as your map is incomplete 
too. In fact, they have bits that you don’t so think of this situation as an opportunity to exchange ideas, 
not to give them.
It’s very useful to realise that the more people you talk to about an event or experience, the more accurate 
your representation of it becomes – if you are willing to accept their version of events as true too.
If giving a piece of your map is “teaching” then pointing to missing pieces encourages “learning”. Choose 
which is more useful!

The more interpretations of the world that you build into your map of the world, the more complete and 
useful it will become. This won’t happen if you continually judge other people’s maps as being wrong 
because they’re different to yours. After all, two different maps can’t both be right can they?
Think of a street map of London and a tube map of London. Which is right? If one is right, the other 
must be wrong! Of course not, and by using both you get twice the useful information. Think of maps 
of experience in the same way and you’ll find things much easier.
When someone is saying that they can’t or won’t do something, there are two amazingly simple yet effective 
questions that you can ask to change forever the way that they think about their problem. These questions 
are only known to the world’s top secret change magicians, so you must promise to use them wisely.
These two magical questions are “what stops you?” and “what would happen if you did?”
No, you didn’t miss anything. That’s all there is to it.
Remember that you tend to get what you focus on. By asking people about their problem, you are focussing 
their attention squarely on the problem itself. The more they look at it, the bigger it gets. Throw in some 
well meaning counselling or therapy and the problem will soon be big enough to be insurmountable.
“Tell me about it”… “Oh dear”… “Why?”… “Why not?”… These questions just embed the problem deeper.
The first question focuses attention on the nature of the problem – what properties the problem has that 
cause it to hinder progress. The question puts the person back in control of the problem and separates 
them from it. They are able to explore the problem as a temporary barrier as the important word in the 
question is “stop” which implies that time is no longer passing.
When people talk about problems, they are often referring to things that happened in the past as if they 
are happening through the present and future. By asking, “what stops you”, you are freezing the problem 
in time and preventing it from affecting the future which is, of course, unwritten.
A sneaky variation on this is “how do you stop yourself?”

Maps
The second question focuses attention on the future after the problem has been solved. It is similar to 
asking “do you need the problem” but that is often too abstract to be useful. Asking “what would happen 
if you did” forces the person to create an internal experience of the future in which he or she has moved 
past the current limitation or barrier. In order to answer the question, the person must create this new 
future representation. In order to create that representation, a very important change must happen inside 
the person’s head. Their world now contains the possibility that there is a solution to the problem. If 
they can imagine it, then it can exist.
When someone says “I can’t learn this” and you ask “what stops you?” they will tell you what barriers 
exist in their perception of the world. You can now work on these barriers directly and remove them, 
move them aside or lower them – whatever metaphor works for the person in question.
You don’t even have to work on the barrier itself in most cases, so you don’t have to spend time “solving” 
the problem. You can just ask them to move it aside for a moment and, if they still need it, they can 
move it back again afterwards. Since the person imposes these barriers, the person can move them too.
If you listen to their language and watch the way they gesture when they talk, you’ll see them describe 
the barrier and tell you where it is. You can either move it yourself, or you can get them to move it. If 
you just go right ahead and work on the assumption that they can do whatever they’re having difficulty 
with, you’ll find that the barrier disappears by itself in most cases.

When someone says, “I can’t learn this” and you ask, “what would happen if you did?” they have to create 
an internal representation of themselves having learned whatever they can’t learn. The possibility now 
exists that the subject is ‘learnable’ by them, given time and resources. The barrier is now gone, because 
it was created by the choice to not look beyond it.
In contrast, if you respond with “why not?” then you accept their model of the world and the limitation 
that exists within it. You are effectively saying, “Yes, I agree that you can’t learn this. Now justify yourself”. 
In return, they will do just that – they will give you a list of very plausible reasons that support their 
limiting belief. In fact, every time you ask “why not?” they will convince themselves, and you, a little more.
This process of recovering lost information is very relevant to logical levels too.
Just a brief aside – the concept commonly termed ‘logical levels’ is more properly known as ‘neurological 
levels’, and it is a contentious area in NLP as it is not part of the original body of knowledge, nor can it 
be derived using the NLP modelling process which was the basis of all of NLP’s techniques. However, 
it is a useful concept which complements NLP’s techniques.
If, when you are explaining something, you jump levels, you are demanding that your audience makes a 
leap of logic to fill in the missing levels. A nice, smooth progression through levels guides the listener’s 
brain on a journey. They will pay more attention to you because they are not ‘inside’ creating missing 
information and they will find information easier to absorb and learn.
When explaining a new idea or concept, the name that you give this idea is expressed as an Identity level 
statement. A smooth progression through levels would be something like this:
The name of the concept
What it is good for
What it can do

An example of how you might use it
When and where you would use it
If you are the kind of trainer who likes to build knowledge up rather than start with abstract theories 
and work down, then this might suit you better:
A situation you might find yourself in
What you would normally do in that situation
All the things that you could do in that situation
What is true to say about that situation
A name for the concept or idea
Of course, in order to fully communicate with your audience, you would use both to appeal to different 
learning styles. Here’s an example.
NLP is a personal development tool kit that can be applied to personal change, problem solving and 
a great many other situations. In training, you might use NLP to communicate effectively with your 
audience during a part of your training course where you want them to remember information easily.
If you’re in a situation where you want to explain the connection between language and behaviour, you 
might start by running through the whole list of profiling categories, giving examples of language and 
behaviour. You could ask the delegates to explain it to each other, or you could ask them to read the list 
of categories and work through a written example. In any case, what’s important is that they start to hear 
the patterns in normal speech and correlate them to behavioural choices. Then, when they have some 
real experience to build on they can understand the relevance of the name ‘metaprograms’.
Hopefully, you noticed that the two last paragraphs were an example of this idea. In the first half, the 
Identity level label was ‘NLP’ and in the second half it was ‘metaprograms’.
“Metaprogram” is NLP jargon for a category of behavioural trait that can be recognised in a person’s 
language and behaviour. Metaprograms perform the same basic function as many other profiling methods 
in that by listening to language structures you can predict behavioural tendencies. Also, by tuning your 
language to that native to a person’s particular metaprograms, you will communicate easily and effectively.

The one big advantage of NLP metaprograms over other profiling methods is that you don’t need to fill 
in forms or questionnaires – you can profile someone whilst having a normal conversation. Once you 
start to hear how the structure of language is littered with the signs of mental processes you’ll wonder 
how you didn’t hear these patterns before.
Metaprograms are also patterns by which people organise their perceptions, and so they give you 
important information about how a learner is organising their understanding of an activity or subject 
as well as how they will behave in response to that perception.
In order for a person’s natural language to shift from one level to another – from “I know how to drive” 
to “I’m a good driver”, for example – some specific internal processes take place.
We have names for most of these processes, for example, if someone shifts from talking about what he 
can do to what he is doing then we might call that either motivation, or making a decision, depending 
on the context.
If someone shifts from talking about what they are doing to what they can do, then they have moved 
from conscious competence to unconscious competence – a process that we might call mastering a skill.

You can hear these shifts in language patterns as you take people through a learning 
experience. They are a very important indicator to you that your learners are rearranging 
their internal organisation to integrate what you are helping them to learn. They are 
adding new information to their maps of the world.
Of course, not only your audience’s language can shift during a learning experience – yours can too. 
You can intentionally shift language patterns at specific points in time to effect change in your audience.
You can think of motivation as being the mental process that takes place when a person 
naturally moves from thinking at the Capability level to thinking at the Behaviour level. 
Therefore, by changing the structure of your language you can directly influence people 
to take action or to organise their ideas and learning more easily.
By listening to how people talk, you can understand how they think. The reverse is also true, so people 
will switch thinking modes depending on how you talk.
When you listen to people talking about skills, tasks, learning and abilities you will hear a number of 
interesting language structures that give you a great deal of useful information about what they have 
learned.
When you hear “I can” or “I can’t” you know that the person is talking about capabilities. When you hear 
“I do” or “I don’t” you know that they are talking about behaviour. The two are fundamentally different 
and must not be confused or generalised to the same meaning.
Language itself is a generalised, distorted, filtered metaphor of what is really happening inside your head.
Here are some examples of the kinds of statements you will hear from learners, along with a translation 
that recovers the original thinking. Read the antidotes carefully as some may look the same but are 
slightly different.
These words are known as ‘modal operators’ and in English grammar, they modify a verb in some way, 
perhaps by placing a condition on it.
The suggested meanings that I have given below are, of course, just ideas based on this particular context, 
and they probably won’t match what you’ll find in the dictionary.

The word “now” has a special meaning for us – it doesn’t necessarily mean this present moment, which 
was just then anyway. “Now” means an ongoing period of time that you internally think of as the present.
For some people, “now” means any time between last week and next week. For others, “now” is just a 
few minutes long. Everything that happens within this moving frame of time is happening “now” so 
you might say “I’m going to the gym now” or “I’m working in London now”. It doesn’t mean that you 
are there right at this moment, it means “in the present” or “these days”.

I know you already knew that, but I wanted to point it out because it’s one of those simple things that 
we take for granted that reveal huge amounts of useful information. You know that I’m writing this 
now, but that’s a different now from the now when you’re reading this. I’m writing this now, and you’re 
reading this now. We are connected through time and space by these words. In fact, we are all connected 
through time and space by the words we use.
It’s always interesting to recognise the many ways that people differ, and the range of possibilities that 
exist within our perception of experience. Time itself is highly subjective and different people will think 
of time in different ways. In particular, what one person calls a short wait is an eternity for someone else.
As you start to hear the way that language reveals the structure of experience, you will hear many different 
ways that people organise their internal resources.
The more you listen, the more amazed you’ll be at the differences between our maps of the world, and 
the better you’ll be at communicating with other people and helping them to learn effectively.

Paying attention
11	 Paying attention
Although this isn’t strictly to do with training (or maybe it is) it actually demonstrates one of the key 
principles that underpin NLP. Without understanding this, people who complete NLP courses just go 
around doing NLP to people instead of absorbing and integrating it. Maybe you’ve met people like that 
in the past – I have, and they certainly put me off NLP!
Many years ago, when I was an apprentice telecoms engineer, I could understand complex systems very 
easily, although sometimes I started taking the thing apart before stopping to find out what was actually 
wrong with it. One day I went to a factory with the local engineer to fix a telephone. I went straight to 
the telephone, picked it up and started taking the back off with my screwdriver. The engineer stopped 
me and suggested I just pick up the handset and listen instead of diving straight in. What I heard wasn’t 
dial tone, but the kind of sound you’d hear if a button were pressed down. Just by stopping and listening, 
I heard everything I needed to know to solve the problem.
A few years later I went to a big tyre factory in Stoke on Trent to carry out a software upgrade on a piece 
of equipment. I waited until everyone had gone home, and then set to work. The upgrade should have 
taken less than an hour but half way through the equipment developed a fault. I spent a few hours trying 
to fix it, and then drove back to Telford to pick up a spare, and then back to Stoke. I finally gave up at 
about one o’clock in the morning. The next morning, I met my manager on site and immediately set to 
work on the equipment again. He stopped me and suggested that I just stand in front of the equipment 
rack and watch. I didn’t see anything helpful, so he suggested I pay attention to the lights on the front.
These things have lights just like the ones on your car’s dashboard, telling you what the status of the 
system is. This piece of equipment had two circuit boards which were physically identical apart from 
the position of a switch that told the system that either Telex terminals or Telex lines were attached. On 
the back of the equipment, terminals or lines would be physically plugged in. In this case, there were 7 
terminals and 2 lines, so on the terminal card there were 7 lights and on the line card, 2 lights.
So, as I watched, I began to notice that the system was telling me it had 7 lines and 2 terminals attached. 
Remember that switch? All I had done was take the two cards out then put them back in the wrong 
slots. That was it, and all I had to do was watch. On the other hand, I got 8 hours overtime, so it’s not 
all bad news.

Paying attention
On a NLP Practitioner course recently, someone was trying to do an exercise called the “fast phobia cure” 
with her partner, who said he was afraid of cockroaches. She couldn’t get the technique to work, so I 
asked him what he was afraid of. What he told me was that he lived in Spain for a while and one day he 
saw a cockroach in his kitchen that ran out from behind a chopping board. The cockroach surprised him, 
then sat, looking at him in an evil way. Now, as you know, cockroaches don’t look evil. In fact, neither 
do people – words like “evil” or “happy” tell you that the person is adding some information on top of 
what they directly saw, heard or felt – they’re adding some of their own experience. Now, if you really 
pay attention to what this person was saying, you can hear that he’s not afraid of what the cockroach 
actually did – he’s afraid of what he imagined that it might do. When we asked him to run through the 
actual experience, he wasn’t scared at all. When we asked him to run through what he imagined might 
happen, the cockroach flew up into his face and attacked him. Who in their right minds wouldn’t be 
afraid of that?
Here’s another example – someone asked me to help him overcome his fear of public speaking. Now, 
you might jump to the conclusion that he was afraid of public speaking, so here’s his original request 
for help, exactly as he said it.
“I would like to be able to accept invitations to speak publicly as easily as you did”.
So, what does that tell you he’s afraid of? Public speaking? No! He loves that bit! In fact, he’s afraid of 
accepting. So, what happens between accepting and presenting? He worries. He’s afraid of worrying. 
When he gets to do the presentation, he loves it – he gets a buzz out of it. Then he says to himself “I 
wish I could remember the feeling of the buzz for next time”, so that was exactly what I had him do.
In problem solving, people will tell you the exact nature of the problem, and give you the solution, within 
the first sentence or so, as long as you pay attention to what’s really there instead of inserting your own 
experience or expectations.
So, you won’t find that in any NLP book that’s based only on the visible techniques of NLP. A book 
like this, that lets you soak up the attitude and approach of NLP is full of stories that help you to learn 
what’s really important.
Remember – if you don’t have the mindset right, the techniques will never work. If you have the right 
mindset, the techniques will come naturally. It’s easy to write down techniques, it’s not so easy to help 
people learn an attitude. For this, we need a highly advanced, highly efficient and highly overlooked 
form of communication – the story.

Time for a story
12	 Time for a story
Time is very important for all sorts of reasons and since we’ve already mentioned the concept of “now” 
we may as well spend some more time on the subject.
Time is subjective. This means that every person thinks of time differently. We all have a shared 
hallucination of the passage of time that is indicated by clocks, but two people in the same room at the 
same time, looking at the clock and seeing the same time will have different perceptions of time flying 
or dragging, depending on their focus of attention.
Someone who is totally focussed and enthralled will think that time has flown. Someone who is thinking 
of other things will be clock watching and will perceive time passing at a crawl.
What makes the difference? Well, partly it’s to do with the way that your ability to absorb information is 
controlled by a part of your brain called the Reticular Activating System. This information is of no use 
to you unless you have your electrodes handy. What is more useful is to know that you tend to get more 
of what you focus on. Focussing on boredom will therefore make you more bored. There’s certainly a 
connection between being bored and being boring, as proven by the Pet Shop Boys. I don’t mean that 
they’re boring, I’m just reminding you that they sang about it. You may think they’re boring which is 
entirely up to you.
You can use a number of methods to direct someone’s attention, and the first we’ll talk about is engaging 
whatever is being focussed on and using it to draw in the listener. A very powerful way to engage attention 
is with stories. Stories encourage the brain to create internal representations, which, surprisingly enough, 
are what memories and facts and figures are.

Later on, you’ll learn about the brain being an analogue computer. Don’t learn about it now, just forget 
I mentioned it. Go on, really try to forget it.
Are you starting to get the idea of how to focus attention? Anyway, since the brain is an analogue computer 
it cannot directly represent anything that doesn’t exist. This includes anything which is somewhere else, 
any time other than now and involving any person other than you. Why do you think you identify with 
characters in films or songs? Because they’re YOU!
So, if you tell a story about someone who lived a long time ago in a faraway land who was really, really 
excited at the thought of being able to learn really easily then your brain can only make sense of the 
information by transporting you to that land and time and into the mind of that person.
I knew someone once who was very inquisitive and always wanted to know how things worked. As 
the years went by, this person stopped wondering how things worked and turned his attention to how 
people worked. You know what it’s like, to watch someone and wonder what goes on between their ears. 
Sometimes, you watch someone and wonder if anything at all goes on between their ears!

Time for a story
Anyway, one day this person found herself sitting and reading a book that answered all the questions that 
he had had and giving her insight into all those curious things that went on in the world. Now, it doesn’t 
always matter too much what the exact detail of the book was. I forget anyway. Time’s like that – things that 
you’re really certain about one day become a bit fuzzy the day after. Soon you can’t quite remember what 
you were certain about all those years ago and once again your mind becomes open to new ideas because 
certainty is a sign that your mind has pulled down the shutters and that’s the last thing you wanted, wasn’t it?
Stories are a very powerful way of communicating directly with each person in a large audience. Why? 
Well, in order to make sense of a story, the listener identifies with the story, searching for relevance and 
connecting their own experience with that of the characters in the story. Therefore, your story will connect 
with the unique experience in each listener’s mind, creating a totally new story that involves the listener 
at a very personal and relevant level. If you tell a story to 30 people, you’ll end up with at least 31 stories.
Everyone loves a story. You can call it an anecdote, gossip, a tale, a rumour, a case study, a report or 
anything else you like that makes it acceptable, respectable or true. Some people have a problem with 
the word story because it implies that the information is made up or untrue. Sometimes this is the case 
and sometimes it isn’t and that’s not relevant to the structure of the story or its effect on the listener.
If you believe in truth then consider this – how do you know that the news is true? You can read two 
newspaper accounts of the same event and read two totally different stories because of different political 
affiliations. You already know that the truth can be bent, but how far will it bend before it becomes a lie? 
That is entirely subjective and depends on your point of view. If you’re a Star Wars fan you’ll recall that 
Obi Wan Kenobi told Luke Skywalker that his father was dead. When Luke found out that his father was 
very much alive and living as Darth Vader, he thought that Obi Wan had lied to him. It turned out that 
Obi Wan had used the term “dead” metaphorically, which made it all right. Language is such a collection 
of metaphor and distortion that it’s hard enough to be precise, let alone true.
So, if you want stories to be true, use true stories. If you don’t mind either way then let your imagination 
run riot. Many years ago, when I worked as a telecoms service engineer, I used to visit a large international 
bank where there was a big room full of people sending and receiving Telex messages. This was the first 
job for many people joining the bank from school and at the end of the room, behind a desk, sat the 
supervisor. Breaks were strictly policed and at lunchtime the whole room closed down.
I remember on a few occasions walking in to that room at lunchtime. Do you think the room was empty, 
all these young bankers down the pub or enjoying a frolic in the park? (The room had no windows!) 
Well, every day, all the young Telex operators would bring their chairs down to the end of the room 
and sit and listen to stories. Every day, the supervisor would tell stories about how life used to be in the 
bank, about the people that had been and gone and about her own journey through the ranks. Every 
day, the audience would sit in a hushed and reverent silence until lunchtime was over and they would 
shuffle back to their terminals.

Now, if you had told them that they weren’t allowed to leave the room at lunchtime, what would have 
happened?
Time can easily be distorted and used to suspend an audience’s perception of ‘real’ time – whatever that is.
Here’s a really simple way of moving people, internally, back to another time. Start off talking about past 
events using past tense for your verbs. The easy way to do this is just to imagine that “now” is the present 
moment and that you are looking back to the past. Your language will naturally reflect this.
When you notice your audience doing things like staring into the distance or to one side, shift your verb 
tense to the present. Again, you just imagine that you have stepped back in time and that “now” is in 
fact “back then”. Here’s an example.
Do you remember your first day at school? What was it like? Do you remember the sights, sounds, maybe 
you remember the taste or smell of school dinners? Perhaps you can imagine what the layout of the 
school was like for you back then, the rooms, the hall, the playground. I don’t know if you can imagine 
it really clearly but as you look around you and just soak up the sounds, what is the first thing that you 
notice? Do you see a teacher? Does everything seem bigger? Do you hear those sounds of children 
playing outside? Do you remember the summer of your exams? Can you hear the calls of the children 
outside in the sunshine as you sit in the examination room? Maybe the smell of the freshly cut playing 
field wafts in through a window? Maybe particular people spring to mind? Friends? Teachers? Dinner 
ladies? Well, you can enjoy it for as long as you like before you return to the present time.
After you have read through that paragraph, go back through and notice the verb tenses. Notice how 
they shift from past to present just before half way. Imagine how different a History lesson would be if 
you were really there. The great thing about this is that everyone listening gets drawn in to their own 
personal version of the story.
Did you know that Roman soldiers used to drink vinegar when they were marching? I don’t know if that’s 
the same kind of vinegar that they have at the chip shop, or if it’s something like my Dad’s home made 
wine that just used to taste like vinegar but you can imagine how you feel on a really hot, dry day when 
you’ve been running around or walking a long way and you can imagine sitting down under a shady tree 
with your Roman friends and taking a long, refreshing drink of…lovely warm vinegar…. Maybe not.
Anyway, the point is that our perception of ‘the time’ and of the flow of time is subjective, changes from 
one moment to the next and can be influenced by the simple use of language. Language is a digital 
system used to encode analogue information, so, just like in your CD player at home, the end result is 
not exactly what you started with but it’s usually close enough.

All recording systems lose information. The telephone network carries only a tiny part of the frequency 
range that we use in human speech. We can cope with this loss because we are able to rebuild the lost 
information based on our experience. The richness of experience that is lost in the translation from 
thought to speech is far greater and, unfortunately, when we rebuild the lost information, the end result 
is never what was intended, and I use the word “never” with caution.
A digital system like language can represent things that aren’t here and now but your analogue brain 
can only process this information within a framework of “here, now, me”. This is also why instructions 
starting with the word “Don’t…” often get the opposite result to what you intend. More on this later. 
Don’t think about it just yet.
Some words are stories in themselves in that they represent a complex collection of memories – sounds, 
images, feelings, tastes and smells. In order for your brain to process any language, words are converted 
into basic sensory representations. In fact, every word is a metaphor in that the word itself is not the 
object or idea described, it is only a label for it.
Every word in every language is a metaphor. A word is not the thing it describes; it 
is only a label for it. To process any word, your brain converts it into a basic sensory 
representation. Therefore, all language has the same effect as telling a story, to a degree.

So you can’t eat the word apple, but you know what an apple is. How about rich, dark, moist chocolate 
fudge cake on a white china plate, with warm chocolate fudge oozing out of it, topped off with a big 
dollop of mustard? Your words have more emotional impact when the listener can engage their internal 
senses and become fully associated with what you are describing – as if it is really happening to them.
It’s important to realise that people choose words because they represent the internal sensory experience 
that’s going on. If you’re running a workshop and you’re summarising comments on a whiteboard, you 
may be tempted to translate, summarise or rephrase in order to write the comments down. You should 
only do this if your intention is to confuse and frustrate the audience, demonstrating to them that you 
are paying no attention to their ideas.
Think of the most indulgent and delicious pudding or dessert you every had in your life. Describe it to 
me. Now let me write on the whiteboard “cake”. Does that do it justice?
Asking people to give you synonyms for words that you suspect to be vague is a good way to uncover the 
experience represented by the word. For example, if you ask people for a synonym for “professionalism” 
you will get answers ranging from “looks smart” through “honest” and on to “confident” and “expert”.
For years, presentation and business communication courses taught that in order to demonstrate 
understanding, we have to paraphrase and restate. NO! This demonstrates that you understand your 
version, not that you understand the other person. If you really want to demonstrate understanding, 
repeat back the key words verbatim.
Paraphrasing demonstrates that you are representing someone else’s memories by 
converting them into your own.
Repeating key words verbatim demonstrates that you are respecting someone else’s 
memories.
Choose which outcome you want before deciding whether to rephrase or repeat.
Some words are far richer than others. A word like “apple” means something different to everyone, in 
that everyone will think of a different apple. However, when we see an apple, we all use the same label 
for it so whilst it’s still a generalisation, it’s vague enough to be OK. When a course delegate describes 
an apple and you write “apple” on the whiteboard, everyone will know what you mean, even though 
everyone will translate the word into a different internal sensory representation (i.e. a different apple).

If a delegate describes a situation where people sometimes arrive in the office late, you might write 
the word “unprofessional” on the whiteboard. Maybe you’ve done something like this in the past, and 
experienced first hand the disagreement and confusion that it leads to. When people are disagreeing in 
this situation, they are not arguing over the word, they are arguing over their internal representations. 
If you try to condense every suggestion and find a single, unifying word, you will be standing at the 
whiteboard all day, unless you summarise every suggestion and write only the words “important things” 
on the whiteboard.
There’s a simple reason for this complex problem. People are arguing because they are talking about 
completely different memories and experiences to that originally described. Everyone has an experience 
of people being late for work. Some people get really upset about it whilst others don’t even care. Even 
though they are talking “in general”, they are describing specific events in their personal history. They 
are telling you about their beliefs and values. You will never, ever reach an agreement because everyone 
is talking about a different experience through different perceptual filters.
If you have to, write 30 different words for “being late” on the whiteboard until you have successfully 
captured each individual memory. You may even stand back in amazement, never before having realised 
that people could see things so differently. The delegates may be amazed too, and may even start to 
develop a respect for each other’s beliefs and language. You will only achieve this if you respect the 
words that people use.
If your intention is to create a single, common representation then I still don’t advise you use the bulldozer 
of paraphrasing as you are only using synonyms that make sense to you. There are far better ways of 
gaining collective agreement, and here are three of them.
Go up
Take all of the different suggestions and find the level at which they unify. Take “arriving late at the office” 
and ask, “what is that an example of” or “what is important about that”. Sooner or later you will end up 
with a collective agreement that “respecting the value of your colleagues” is important, even though being 
early or late is down to individual preference. You may well find that “professionalism” is important to 
everyone, but the difference is the process by which you arrived at that word.
Instead of saying, “Punctuality equals professionalism” you are saying, “Punctuality is an example of 
professionalism” which is very different. If you go back to the chapter on logical levels, the first example 
here is like saying “a pig is a cow” whereas the second example is more like “pigs and cows both live on 
farms”. One respects people’s maps of the world, the other doesn’t. You decide which to use.

Time for a story
Start again
If you can’t agree on a representation, make up a new one. For example, what is the best state to be in to 
deliver a presentation? You may get lots of different replies including “relaxed”, “objective”, “confident” 
and “knowledgeable” in which case you could make up a new state called ROCK, which allows each 
person to integrate their own beliefs with some new ideas that they’ve picked up.
Use brute force
What if two people disagree over ideas that are exact opposites? Well, with all of these things I suggest 
you cheat. This is a special form of cheating that appears to everyone else to be highly skilful but which 
you know is really easy. Let’s say one person says you should be confident and the other says you should 
be nervous. The word “should” tells you that they are comparing what is being suggested to their internal 
set of rules and values. You “should” be confident because their rules say so.
Again, you can handle this in many different ways, and here are two suggestions.
First, you can say, “I can see that you both strongly agree with each other that your state of mental 
preparation is very important”, so you force them into an agreement. In fact, they are agreeing with other 
if you look at the situation from a certain level. If I say red and you say blue, we both agree that colour 
is important and we both care intensely about making the right choice. We’re just arguing over detail.

Time for a story
Second, you can say, “Would it be most useful to be confidently nervous or nervously confident?” Not 
possible, but useful. You know that it’s possible, and asking which is most useful creates a new state that 
encompasses the most positive aspects of the two original states. Even the most opposite views can be 
squashed together in this way because in order to make sense of the new suggestion, the brain must 
move up to a higher logical level where it is possible for the two states to co-exist.
What may look or sound like disagreement is in fact an agreement over necessity and a disagreement 
over detail.
Stories are a very powerful means of communication and you’ll be surprised at how much factual, specific 
information can be conveyed more meaningfully and memorably by using a story. You’ve probably heard 
mnemonic stories for remembering sequences of data or components of a business process and these 
are certainly very useful as they engage more parts of the listener’s brain than mere repetition of the 
list. The idea is that the learner goes for a walk in a park, or a shopping trip, or a day at the seaside, and 
along the journey sees things that link back to the sequence to be remembered. They key to using this 
successfully is to create a natural flow from one element to the next.
Which of these is easier to remember:
Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet
Richard of York Gave Battle In Vain
Or my old Physics teacher at school used to talk about a friend of his named Roy. Roy Gbiv
I bet you even remember the colours of a rainbow as Red, Yellow, Pink, Green, Orange, Purple and Blue
Our brains can recall huge amounts of information, but many people find sequencing that information 
difficult. Therefore, any format that can create a structured sequence around “raw” data can only be a 
useful thing.
I should finally add that every story in this book is absolutely and entirely true. Only the places, times 
and people involved may have changed during the editing process.

Environment
13	 Environment
I’ve worked in many training centres, some of them converted from other buildings like hotels, many of 
them custom built training and conference centres. I’ve also worked in training rooms in corporate offices.
One thing I’ve noticed that most of them have in common is that they are very carefully designed and 
built training centres. That does not make them learning centres.
The emphasis is on the trainer, not the learners. Rooms arranged like classrooms, fluorescent lighting, 
space at the front of the classroom for a desk and an OHP and a screen or whiteboard at the front of 
the room for everyone to sit and stare at.
So, if you have the opportunity to design a working environment, design it from the point of view of 
the people it is intended to serve, not the person who books it.
Think of the environments that make you feel most relaxed and receptive. Think of the places where you 
feel most safe and comfortable. Those are great learning states. Stress, anxiety, feeling self conscious – 
these are not learning states.
So, give some thought to these aspects of the environment:
What colours relax you and make you feel at home?
What colours make you feel alert?
• What kind of furniture lets you know you’re at work?
• What sounds let you know you can relax
• What words make you feel relaxed?
• What words make you feel curious?
• How can you create a learning environment so that it looks, feels and sounds as little like a 
school as possible?
• How can you reproduce elements of the working environment within the training room so 
that learning takes place directly into the context that it will be applied in?

Making memories
14	 Making memories
You know how one little thing reminds you of a whole series of memories? Maybe a smell brings an 
entire holiday back, or a certain colour or sound reminds you of something special? In NLP jargon, 
these triggers are called Anchors.
Anchoring is a perfectly natural process that is part of your brain’s memory storage system. By connecting 
sensory experiences with simple reference markers, an entire memory can be brought to life with one 
simple stimulus, like a certain smell takes you back to that holiday, or a certain piece of music brings to 
mind a vivid memory of someone special.
How can you use this natural process to your own advantage? Here are a 
few ideas.
Preparing yourself for an important presentation, reprogramming phobias, 
as an accelerated learning tool, as a tool for focussing the attention of a 
group, for influencing behaviour, for relaxing yourself or other people, for 
getting yourself out of bed on Monday morning, for getting yourself to 
sleep on Monday night or just for making yourself feel great about dealing 
with life’s distractions.

Making memories
Advertisers know how this process works and they use it to connect a particular emotional state with 
their brand name and logo. If you watch commercials on TV, you’ll notice that some of them seem 
to bear no relation to the product they’re advertising. You’ll see a series of images that have certain 
connotations, like security, happiness, love and desire and at the end of the advert you just see a brand 
name. You should pay attention to the music, as it’s just as important as the images. One group of adverts 
that spring to mind are those for the Peugeot 406. The images were of great heroic acts, saving lives and 
being generally manly, whilst being caring and understated. The music was M People’s “Search for the 
hero”. There’s no need to say what Peugeot wants its customers to think of themselves.
So, how does anchoring work? Well, you basically get yourself into a heightened emotional state – any 
one will do – and then see, hear or feel some unique, simple sensory stimulus such as a word, sound, 
image or touch. You could visualise a colour, hear a word, speak a word or squeeze your hand in a certain 
way – all of these work well as anchors and work best when used together.
Anchoring has always been a difficult process to describe in a book as your attention is on the book 
instead of your own state, so I’ve tried something different here. Have a go and see what you think.
Read through this following piece of text, only turning the page at the end when you have finished 
reading. As you reach the end of the text, pay attention to any feelings you have and then turn over the 
page.
It’s probably a good idea to have the page ready to turn before you start reading so that you can catch 
the relaxed state while it lasts.
You may want to sit somewhere relatively quiet to do this.
Imagine yourself lying in a warm meadow. As you feel the warmth of the sun’s rays on your skin and in 
your hair, a breeze whispers over your skin like someone whispering your name.
You hear sounds, quiet and distant, and with your eyes closed, you can just make out the distant music of 
birdsong. You realise that the birdsong is all around you, moving left and right, up and down. You open 
your eyes and see swallows darting through the crystal blue sky. Realising how bright the Sun is, you 
take a deep breath and allow your eyes to gently close again as your attention drifts back to those sounds.
With the breeze drifting so lightly across the meadow, you reach out and feel how cool the grass is. The 
touch of the grass is so soothing on your hands that you press your palms into the grass and feel your 
fingers stretching right out as far as they can stretch.

Making memories
As you hold your hands up to your face to shield your eyes from the brilliant Sun, you notice the smell 
of the grass on your hands and it reminds you of long summer evenings at home when the smell of 
fresh cut grass lingered in the air. Letting your mind wander through these wonderful memories for a 
while, your attention is slowly drawn back to the meadow as you realise how much you can enjoy being 
as relaxed as you can possibly be…
What do you think of that?
Now, you can wake yourself up and think about something else, maybe what you had for breakfast or 
what you’ll do tonight. What colour is your favourite hat? Does a rainbow have red on the inside or the 
outside?
An important step in establishing an anchor is to break the anchored state and then return to it, so 
imagine yourself feeling really calm and tranquil and quickly look back at the star.
Now that the anchor is beginning to set, you can think of the last time you really laughed and the last 
film you saw.
Now, look back at the star again and notice what happens to your feelings of relaxation.
People naturally emphasise the things they say. They point in a certain direction whenever they talk 
about the future. They use a certain voice tone to indicate uncertainty. They touch you whenever they 
laugh. They install anchors in you, all day, every day. It’s time you started fighting back!

Making memories
In a learning environment, it can be very useful to create anchors for certain states that the audience 
could benefit from. There will naturally be times when the audience are curious, certain, happy or wide 
awake. There are some very long winded ways to get the audience into a receptive state, but you can 
already add up what you’ve read so far and achieve the same thing in about 30 seconds. On top of this, 
you can anchor the state and return to it instantly, any time you need to.
You might choose a certain word, or a visual symbol such as a toy or coloured pen to switch states. The 
important thing is consistency. When you see the audience move naturally into a certain state, grab it 
with an anchor. When they laugh, anchor it with a gesture, word, colour – anything you have to hand.
When the audience is in a focussed state, anchor it so that you can get people’s attention back after 
exercises. When the audience is quiet at the start of the course, anchor their reluctance to speak and use 
it to control debates that are getting out of hand.
Is confusion a useful state to anchor?
You may be screaming “Oh no! This is manipulative” in which case don’t do it. Just carry on doing this 
the way you already do.
As you may already know, a lot of NLP is used in the area of influence and persuasion. This doesn’t 
mean that NLP is inherently persuasive, it just means that some people have chosen to apply it in that 
way. This issue always comes up on NLP training courses, so here’s my view.
One of the keys to understanding how to benefit from NLP is to throw away your value judgements 
about behaviours and beliefs. Behaviour that you may label “wrong” is actually very effective in a 
different context. Someone once said on a training course that he wanted to stop shouting at his kids. I 
said, “Imagine for a moment that there is a miracle psychological tool that can remove from your brain 
the ability to shout at your kids. Life would be wonderful, you would never even be able to shout, let 
alone have to stop yourself, and your home life will be relaxing and enjoyable. One day, when you’re in 
town with your kids, one of them steps into the road in front of a car…and you can’t shout” As usual, 
the problem is actually just a symptom.
You can be quite certain that people had the ability to be manipulative, influential and persuasive long 
before NLP came along. You shouldn’t give NLP more credit than it deserves!
Just to get back to anchoring for a moment longer, it is the fundamental process beneath learning, so 
whether you purposefully use anchoring in your training or not, it is vital for your learners to connect 
new information into their existing perceptions and experiences, so you might as well introduce some 
consistency into that natural process.

The easy way to be ‘congruent’ is to start by believing what you are saying. If your conscious and 
unconscious minds agree, you will send the same message through all of your communication systems. 
You don’t have to remember all that body language stuff you read about years ago. It will all happen 
naturally and thereby be far more convincing.
If you’ve ever stood there, speaking to a group and not really wanting to be there, do you think it’s 
enough to just say the words? No! They can tell! Audiences, like dogs, can smell fear.
Many people have written excellent books on how to focus your thoughts and clear your mind in order 
to be totally congruent. I won’t rewrite them here, although that doesn’t stop other authors that I could 
mention.
Apparently, he didn’t steal the material, he was just doing research and it ended up in his book by mistake. 
Anyway, I will give you a few handy tips that you can put into practice.
What do you want?
It’s very important that you are very, very clear about what it is that you want. In order to set your brain 
up to automatically achieve your goals for you, your goals must conform to certain rules.
It’s just like making sure that a computer program conforms to the syntax of the programming language. 
If it doesn’t, it might still run but the results may be unexpected.
Remember to use this both for your own goals as well as for setting goals for your learners.
Here are the rules for “well formed outcomes”:
Positive – as something you want, rather than something you don’t want.

Under your control. It is no use having a goal like “to get promoted” because that is probably not entirely 
under your control. A better goal would be “to do everything that I can possibly do to position myself 
for my promotion”.
Real and represented in your senses. It is not enough to say that you aim “to successfully complete” 
something. What does successful completion look, sound and feel like? Lets say your aim is to write 
a training course manual. How will you know when it’s finished? Will you see it, sitting printed and 
bound on your desk? Will you read it, noticing the words? Will you pick it up and feel its weight, or 
flick through the pages? Everything that you ‘know’ is a sensory experience, stored in your memory. To 
easily achieve a goal, you must have a specific and direct sensory test for it.
Ecological – You must not lose anything as a result of achieving this goal, otherwise you will sabotage 
your own attempts. This often happens when people try to give up smoking.
When you have adapted your goal to meet these criteria, you can test it using this simple set of four 
questions, which check the goal logically (as in real logic, not just common sense). Ask yourself each 
question and wait until you get an answer. You can write your answers down if it helps.
If I achieve this, what will I gain?
If I achieve this, what will I lose?
If I don’t achieve this, what will I gain?
If I don’t achieve this, what will I lose?
And finally, pay really close attention to any feelings that you get as you ask yourself this last question:
If I were offered this right now, would I take it?
If there is anything that you haven’t considered, or if any part of you would object to this goal, you will 
get a definite reaction to that question.
Have a dream
When are you at your most confident? Is it when you try something new, or 
when you do something you know you can do easily?
First, remember four or five specific times when you used skills or abilities that you value highly and 
that you want to have easy access to.

Allow yourself to daydream into those memories. See everything that you saw, hear everything that you 
heard and feel everything that you felt – both touch and emotions. Take some time to remember the 
whole event in as much detail as you can.
Now run the whole event again from a different point of view. If you were talking to someone, watch 
the event from over their shoulder. Notice how you look, your facial expressions, notice your tone of 
voice. Watch the event again from other points in the room. Make a mental note of anything new you 
learn whilst running through these memories.
Next, do the same exercise again but this time daydream into the future. Think about how the room 
will look, the people, the sound of your voice. See things both as yourself and also from the audience’s 
chair. Notice how confident you look and sound. Take as long as you need to fully imagine the whole 
experience. See the audience nodding and smiling.
Repeat this a couple of times so that it becomes very easy to imagine. Run through this new ‘memory’ 
whenever you get a quiet moment. Imagine everything going well. If anything gets in your way, you are 
able to easily overcome it.

Splash in the puddle
First, pick the emotional state you want – certainty, confidence, passion, 
etc. Then, stand about 2 feet in front of an imaginary puddle on the floor.
Notice how the puddle is made of a pure colour – pick any colour you like that makes sense for the 
emotional state that is in the puddle. Watch the puddle for just a moment and then, only when you’re 
ready, jump in! – make as big a splash as you like! See the colour splash up and feel the emotional state 
take over. See the colour dripping from you as the emotion flows through your body.
Really enjoy it.
If you want to be a little more reserved, just step into the puddle. An alternative is to place the puddle 
outside a door or on a stage, so that as you walk towards your destination you walk straight through the 
puddle, seeing the colour splash up as you step into it.
Anchors away!
You remember anchoring? Well, you can set yourself up a number of 
anchors to trigger particular states. The more you use them, the stronger 
they become.
You could have one for each different emotional state that will be of use to you, and anchor each one on 
a different finger, with a different word or with a different colour. You can combine this with the puddle 
splash described above to have a different coloured puddle for different occasions.
You can see that these are different ideas for applying anchors to useful states, and here are some other 
ideas for anchors:
• A word
• A voice tone
• A physical item on your desk
• Something on the dashboard of your car
• Something that you see every morning
• A person’s name
• A physical movement or touch
• A piece of music

Modelling
16	 Modelling
Modelling is a very important part of NLP. In fact, purists will tell you that NLP is only modelling, there 
is nothing else. Everything else that we’ve talked about is not in itself NLP. NLP is just the process by 
which we get this expertise out of the heads of experts.
You are an expert. Anything that you can do really well without having to think about it is a talent. 
Maybe you’ve had the experience of watching someone do something amazing and asking them “how 
did you do that?” to which they reply “erm…I just did it. Doesn’t everyone do it?”
Many people assume that this means the behavioural knowledge required to perform a complex task 
is locked away and is irretrievable. We get a glimpse of the knowledge through observing behaviour, 
but there is no way to extract the knowledge itself. Other people went on to guess at the behavioural 
programming, based on their observations. They made one key mistake – they tried to guess “why” the 
individual behaved that way instead of asking “how”. “Why” is irrelevant. If I want to copy your talent 
for writing music, or sticking to a diet, or remember people’s names at a party, I don’t need to know why 
you do it. I just need to know how, so I can learn to do it.
Traditional “body language” is an example of this, where a particular movement “means” something 
specific such as arrogance or fear. Body movement is not a language in itself, it’s a component of 
communication. The effects of “body language” training are still with us today, lingering on in presentation 
skills courses that teach people how to stand so that they look confident. Isn’t it better just to be confident, 
and let your body language naturally reinforce that?
The originators of NLP, John Grinder and Richard Bandler, decided that all the behavioural psychologists 
were missing something important. Instead of watching how someone performed a complex task, they 
just went and asked them. Did they get the “erm…” answer? Well, at first they did but then they developed 
a way of asking that was new and effective.
Bandler and Grinder were first interested in excellent communicators in the field of personal change, 
so they went to talk to some of the most outstanding therapists at the time. They found that these 
people had certain things in common to do with they way that they communicated. By exploring these 
similarities, a model was developed of the way these people used language to influence patterns of 
thought and behaviour.
So, all the stuff about anchoring and senses and storytelling is just NLP applied. It’s not strictly NLP 
itself. NLP is the process by which we found out how to do those things by talking to experts.

Modelling
I’m not going to go into modelling in much detail here, as it could easily fill a book much larger than 
this one all by itself. There are so many books around on modelling and it’s not the subject of this one. 
So why mention it? Well, because modelling is more of a mindset of curiosity than an explicit set of tools 
that you must use as prescribed. This mindset will help you to learn interesting things from experts, 
from other trainers, from delegates and from yourself.
You probably already know about learning styles. What are you? Have you done one of those online 
tests that tell you how you learn? Well, I suspect you already know how you learn. As Harry Hill said, 
“you can tell a lot about people from what they’re like”.
As with all “personality tests”, they’re not true. They represent a way of thinking about and categorising 
a certain type of behaviour. If there were four learning types, you would see people everywhere fitting 
neatly into the four types. If there were eight, you would see…well you get the idea. Personality types 
are a filter through which you can view the people of the world. They are not true, in and of themselves 
because there are only two types of people in the world – those who think that there are two types of 
people in the world and those who don’t.

Modelling
When you watch your delegates, you will notice that they do certain things in a certain order. You will 
be able to watch the process by which they individually learn. In the appendix, there are some exercises 
that you can use. Try the one about juggling for a demonstration of learning patterns. Some people will 
go into a corner, others will form groups. Most of them will stand up and move about. If you watch 
people with the curiosity of the NLP modelling mindset, you will notice patterns in the way that people 
learn. These patterns will help you to help people learn. After all, that is your job, isn’t it?
Here are a few ways that you can approach modelling. Choose what works best for you.
The logical levels approach
Simply use the Logical Levels hierarchy as a structure for asking questions, so that you guide your 
interviewee through a sequence of thoughts and experiences. This approach works well for skills that 
are highly unconscious – the person doesn’t know they do it – as you can start at a very abstract level 
and gradually work down until you get the answers you need to create your model for the skill.

Success Factor Modelling
Robert Dilts is probably the most well known and prolific NLP modeller, having modelled people like 
Walt Disney and produced models of generic skills such as leadership and creativity.
Dilts’ Success Factor Modelling approach requires that you find a number of people who appear to share 
a common skill or talent. The whole modelling process is as follows:
• Interview the individual
• Interview the people they work with or relate to
• Watch them in their normal environment to confirm the model
• Check the model against their peers to benchmark their performance
• Check the model against your own peers to check current research or thinking
• Check the model against the individual or company’s vision – their stated future direction
• Check the model against the individual or company’s past – their legacy or habits
From all of these separate models you can then refine a model of the specific skill that can be used by 
anyone to achieve the same results.
Strategy elicitation and the TOTE model
The ability to change the process by which we experience reality is more often valuable than changing 
the content of our experience of reality
A strategy is a specific sequence of steps that are necessary to perform a particular task. Simply, you take 
your subject through the skill, step by step, until you have built up a detailed map of the behaviour. For 
example, a skill for goal setting might break down into:

Modelling
1.	 Visual construct of desired outcome
2.	 Kinaesthetic check for congruence of outcome
3.	 Visual recall of current situation
4.	 Visual construct of steps required to reach outcome
5.	 Kinaesthetic check for congruence of outcome
In other words, the person imagines what they would like to have, feels good about it, imagines the steps 
they need to take and, if it feels right, they do it.
The TOTE model adds an extra layer of formality to the basic strategy in that it adds criteria for starting 
the strategy and ending it. TOTE stands for Test Operate Test Exit, so to the above example it adds “how 
do you know when you want something?” and “how do you know when you’ve got it?” The ‘TOTE’ is 
essentially the start and stop for the strategy. You know to shake hands when you meet someone and see 
their outstretched hand, and you know to stop when you have finished the handshake. You can observe 
different strategies in operation when the other person wants to hold on for longer than you do, or your 
hands don’t quite connect properly. You may even have experienced shaking hands with someone who 
didn’t intend to shake your hand!

Modelling
You will typically find that your subject has very specific criteria for the Test and Exit stages, for example 
someone who is scared of public speaking may know to get scared if there are more than 3 people in the 
audience. If there are fewer than 3, it doesn’t count as a presentation so the ‘get scared’ strategy doesn’t 
run (the Operate part). This in itself is a very useful change tool – shifting the criteria so that the problem 
strategy no longer runs. By approaching change work in this way, you are acknowledging the value of 
the behaviour, the strategy, and simply changing the situation in which it is generated.
In the original NLP model, e.g. in books such as ‘Structure of Magic’ (1 and 2) and ‘Patterns of the 
Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H Erickson MD’ (1 and 2), you will find many examples and transcripts 
of strategy elicitations in a therapeutic context.
To make it easier to write a strategy down as a person is speaking, we can use a specific notation for 
the steps in a strategy, as follows:
V
Visual
At
Auditory Tonal
Ad
Auditory Digital i.e. Language
K
Kinaesthetic
O
Olfactory
G
Gustatory
I
Internal
E
External
C
Constructed
R
Recalled
In keeping with NLP’s model of behaviour being based on the subjective deletions, distortions and 
generalisations which constitute ‘reality’, all steps of a strategy are sensory components – modalities – 
and they can be generated either internally or externally.
For example, Visual Internal, VI, denotes a ‘mental image’, which could be recalled, such as an image of 
a recent night out, or it could be constructed, such as an image of you on a future night out.
Clearly, external stimuli are in real time and are neither constructed nor recalled. This presents an 
important distinction for understanding metaprograms,specifically the idea that all metaprograms are 
context specific results of an internal or external focus of attention..
When mapping out a strategy, we use the notation as follows:
Ve > ViR > AdiC > Ki

Modelling
To indicate a strategy where the person sees something in the outside world, then remembers seeing 
something, then hears some internal dialogue and finally has a feeling about that – a judgement or 
conclusion.
The Exit of a strategy – the conclusion – is very often an internal feeling. You’ll hear people describe this 
when they say that a decision feels right, or that they have a gut feeling about something, or that they 
had a feeling that something was right or wrong.
For example, I might see something in a shop, remember one that I have at home, say to myself, “I could 
do with a new one of those” and finally feel a desire to buy it. The same overall structure could equally 
apply to me seeing an apple, comparing it to an internal representation of an apple, saying to myself, 
“This looks like a nice apple” and feeling a desire to eat it. I could also see someone’s face, compare it to 
a time when that person was angry, say to myself, “Here we go again” and feel a sinking feeling.
For a person, strategies tend to be consistent in multiple contexts. After all, why waste time learning new 
strategies? Life in general is very conservative and human beings will tend to be consistent, so eliciting 
a strategy in one context is often valuable in many contexts.
The test of a strategy is only consistency. If a person can get the same result without having to think 
about it, they are working perfectly and their behaviour is working perfectly because it is achieving what 
it is meant to. Remember, every behaviour has a positive intention – it is designed to achieve something. 
Whether that something is good or bad depends only on context.
The TOTE in NLP – Test Operate Test Exit – is a concept developed in 1960 as an extension to the 
Stimulus Response theories of people such as Pavlov. It simply means that you have a way of knowing 
to start doing something, a way of knowing to keep doing it and a way to know to stop doing it, and 
then you can stop thinking about it.
You may recall that Pavlov was someone who owned some dogs, and his dogs trained him to keep feeding 
them while ringing a bell to entertain them. Eventually they only had to start drooling in order to get 
him to feed them. They could have lived without the bell, but it seemed to make him happy. Whilst this 
is cited as an experiment in Stimulus-Response, you could also consider it as an early demonstration 
of anchoring.
If we represent a simple TOTE such as shaking hands as a flowchart, this is what we get:

Modelling
As you can immediately see, we have a problem when representing behavioural decisions in this way. 
How do you know if this is someone you should shake hands with? Have you met them before? Is it a 
social situation? Is anyone else shaking hands? Do you have anything sticky on your hands? Are you 
holding a glass? Are they holding a glass? Do they want to meet you? Once you’re shaking hands, how 
many times do you shake? How long do you hold on for? When do you let go? How do you let go?
Even a very simple behaviour breaks down into so many decision points that to represent it using TOTE 
flowcharts would be very complicated. In order to make sense of the behaviour, we have to assume so 
much that the model is generalised beyond comprehension to anyone except someone who already 
knows how to shake hands.

Motivation
17	 Motivation
Opinion seems to be divided over whether the carrot or the stick is best for motivation and some people 
think “both” is right. It’s worth us just applying what we know so far to this important subject.
Motivation is a process that translates thought into action, so the first thing to ask is “what exactly do you 
want people to do?” You can use various language structures that naturally generate motivation which 
you can read about elsewhere in this book, including logical levels, moving in time and well formed 
outcomes. When you choose to generate a feeling of motivation you must be certain that what people 
do as a result is what you intend, therefore it is most important to start with clear goals.
One of the ways in which personalities can differ and thereby be categorised is the natural direction 
of motivation. Motivation is always a strong, compelling, positive force. In some people it is generated 
towards goals and desires and in others it is generated away from things to be avoided. Some people 
like tidiness, others like avoiding mess. Some people like security, others like to avoid insecurity. In both 
cases, the motivation is positive. It doesn’t involve fear or threat, it just heads in a different direction.

Motivation
This is very important when you structure your language. If your preference is naturally ‘towards’ then 
you are likely to say things like “Do this because the end result will be really great”. This will be fairly 
meaningless to all the ‘away from’ people who like to hear things like “Do this because it will save you 
work later”.
It’s very useful to pay attention to what people say when they’re listing reasons for decisions or actions. 
If you tune the direction of your language to theirs, you will simply tell them what they want to hear 
and reassure them that there is a purpose in what you are asking of them.
When you choose to use either the carrot or the stick, you are choosing between pleasure and pain, desire 
and fear. By using the stick, you are often threatening to deprive someone of something that they want, 
or threatening a course of action that they will find unpleasant. “Do this or else…” is a stick command. 
“If you do this then…” is a carrot command.
As usual, I’m going to leave it to you to decide which, if either, is appropriate for your situation. Neither 
is right or wrong – it all depends on how you choose which to use. One thing that you should bear in 
mind is the effect that the carrot and stick have on the brain and in particular the focus of attention. 
Remember that humans cannot think of doing nothing, they must think of doing something, even if it 
doesn’t seem like much.
When we generalise our own thoughts into language, ambiguous, analogue alternatives tend to take on a 
binary quality. When you say, “don’t drop the glass,” you usually mean “hold the glass tight”. In a digital, 
binary system this holds true. In an analogue system like the human brain, the opposite of “don’t drop 
the glass” can be “hold the glass tight”, “yesterday” or “a turnip”. There are no opposites in an analogue 
system, only an infinite number of alternatives. An interior designer will tell you that the opposite of 
red is green, but that’s only because they have a frame of reference for colour matching. What is the 
opposite of a zebra? What is the opposite of Tuesday? With no digital frame of reference, opposites and 
negatives have no meaning.
The effect of this binary generalisation is that we tend to think of motivation as being linear. We tend 
to think that people have limited choices because our own choices are limited by what we are currently 
thinking about.
Some people tend to think of carrot or stick motivation like this:

Motivation
In that the person can be motivated to go either one way or the other. This is misleading and leads to 
expectations that people will do what you want them to when motivated correctly. This is not the case.
Because of the analogue nature of thought, the bizarre way that your focus of attention is pulled from 
one idea to another from one moment to the next and the fact that, regardless of what you want, other 
people have needs too, the way that stick motivation works is actually more like this:
You provide the impetus, the compelling event, the driving force. You light the blue touch paper and 
retire.
If you’re not careful, you will set people off in all directions and they will do some very strange things 
indeed to avoid what you are threatening them with.
In many companies, I have seen sales people given huge targets and threats of losing their jobs if they 
don’t perform well. Some of them panic and immediately rush off to call customers. Some start ringing 
recruitment agencies. Some give up all hope and go home. Some go to the pub to drown their sorrows. 
Some laugh. Some cry. Only a small minority actually do what was intended – work harder.
Conversely, this is the effect of carrot motivation:
Download free eBooks at bookboon.com

NLP – Skills for Learning
89 
Motivation
The carrot gives people a direction and draws them towards your desired outcome.
You already know about how to set goals, use positive language and direct people’s attention, so this 
really shouldn’t come as a surprise.
Which of those two is more useful to you? Don’t answer now – decide when you need to make the 
choice, based on the situation that you are in and the information you have then.
Think back to what you learned about logical levels and apply this to motivation. Very often, you’ll 
hear people tell each other to be more positive, or more professional, or more open. This information is 
absolutely useless because these words mean totally different things to different people.
Imagine a scenario where a manager tells a group of people to be more professional. Some people will 
dress smarter, some will tidy their desks, some will charge more for their services, some will go on a 
training course to become experts, some will go to law school and some will start speaking to customers 
in a more condescending way. Only a few of them will actually do what was intended.
When you want to change people’s behaviour, use language at the behaviour level. Tell them what to 
do, not what to be.
For the people who are motivated towards outcomes, you need to tell them what will happen if they do 
what you ask. For the people who are motivated away from problems, you need to tell them what they 
will avoid if they do what you ask. To make sure you cover everyone, use both:
“By using this method, you’ll reach the goal more quickly and avoid some common mistakes”
“When you use what you’ve just learned about motivation, you’ll be able to motivate people more easily 
and avoid resistance more often, creating a more effective and less stressful learning environment.”
Finally, it’s worth bearing in mind that if your requests for action are reasonable, and people can see 
benefits for themselves, people generally don’t need much encouragement to take action.
Remember – there’s one easy way to get people to do what you want – TELL THEM WHAT 
YOU WANT!
(And let them decide if they want to give it to you)

18	 I’ll go halves with you
You’ll often find that books and training courses on Accelerated Learning mention brain structure and 
neurology. One course covers the different functional components of the brain, so that you can understand 
that you need to activate learners’ Reticular Activating Systems in order to keep their attention. I don’t 
know how you could apply this information in a training situation, other than to stick electrodes into 
learners’ brains to keep them awake.
The books and courses that I have seen use fairly traditional models of brain structure, in that the brain 
is neatly divided into functional components that connect to each other.
I won’t say that these models are old and outdated, because the truth is that we still do not know exactly 
how the brain is structured and how it works.
One model of brain structure shows the brain divided into two halves – which is true from a physical 
point of view.
Here’s an image of the brain, looking down from the top:

I’ll go halves with you
You can see that the two halves are separate – in fact they are connected at the base by a bundle of nerves 
called the Corpus Collosum.
The question is whether the two halves have identical functions or whether they are specialised into a 
“creative” side and a “logical” side. The left half of your brain is wired up to the right side of your body 
and the right half of your brain is wired up to the left side of your body. Brain scans show different 
areas becoming active for different tasks, but we really can’t say for certain that the brain is organised 
so neatly into creativity and logic. In fact, brain areas can easily reorganise to work around disease or 
injury, and people who have major strokes or other damage very early on in life recover full functionality 
so it’s possible that the two hemispheres are designed for redundancy rather than differentiation, just 
like your lungs or kidneys.
Some scientists currently believe that the two halves of our brains are partly specialised to perform 
different tasks. There are a number of ways that we can demonstrate the way that the brain is organised.
Another model of brain organisation has us equipped with multiple intelligences. Again, these may just 
be another filter or generalisation. On the other hand, they provide a useful framework for ensuring 
that learning is presented to take advantage of all of our mental processes. The more ways you learn 
something, the easier it is to remember.
Sensory systems play a major role in memory and recall. Visual memories are easy and quick to access 
and allow the learner to view large amounts of information together. Auditory memories are typically 
accessed at the start and played through like a tape, so it’s hard to access information randomly. Try 
remembering the eighth word in your favourite song without playing it from the start. Kinaesthetic 
memories take a long time to access and tend not to contain specific information. Kinaesthetic memories 
are often used by medical students who can be seen moving their joints and prodding themselves during 
exams. When you go in through your front door at night, does it open in to the left or the right? Ask 
several people this question and you will see some of them moving their arms as if opening the door – a 
kinaesthetic memory in action.

If you’re interested in Gardner’s multiple intelligences, they are:
Visual/spatial
Good at understanding images, icons, graphics or maps. Good at 
manipulating images internally and visualising.
Logical/mathematical
Good with numbers, logic problems, deduction, reasoning.
Auditory/musical
Good at remembering tunes, rhythm. Hears tone of voice more than words.
Auditory/language
Good with words, anagrams, crosswords. Able to use indexes easily. Hears 
content rather than tone of voice.
Interpersonal
Good at interpreting relationships, empathic with others.
Intrapersonal
Aware of internal processes and feelings. In touch with self.
Kinaesthetic
Good with anything physical e.g. learning dance steps or martial arts
Natural
Enjoys the natural world, understands ecology, can name plants.
There were originally seven intelligences in the work of Dr. Howard Gardner, the Natural intelligence 
was added more recently. I’m personally not sure it fits with the others, it seems to be more about the 
content of what is learned than the process by which it is learned.
Many of these overlap onto the basic sensory preferences. For example, people who are good at maths 
and logic usually have a highly refined visual strategy – they see the numbers or solutions in their heads. 
This implies that you can take people who are poor spellers or mathematicians and teach them a better 
strategy. This is actually very easy to do and will bring you good results very quickly.
You have no doubt heard about learning styles and personality types and lots of other categorisation 
methods. What all of these methods do is generalise human capability into categories. You don’t need 
to worry about labelling people being bad or wrong – it’s just a by-product of the way that our brains 
are wired to use language to code our experience. For example, think about two identical chairs. They 
are both chairs. Think about two different chairs. They are still both chairs. In fact, the first two are as 
different as the second two, they’re just different in different ways.
We use the word “chair” as a short cut to the sensory experience that we get from the object, but that 
sensory experience is not the object, just as you can’t sit on the word “chair”. Labelling and categorising is 
a natural process, but sometimes it gets out of hand. If we label a chunk of the population as “reflectors” 
and expect them to learn in only one way, we can expect them to behave how we expect them to. All 
of these categories are a more accurate description of how you think than about the people you are 
describing. Categorisation and labelling gives away much more information about your filters on the 
world than about the people in the world. In fact, there are around 6 billion learning styles and personality 
types in the world, but thinking about it that way can make it harder to design training courses in the 
traditional way.

So, however your brain is organised it’s a good idea to use all of it. It doesn’t matter which organisation 
model you prefer – what’s important is that you have a way of reminding yourself to engage all of the 
learner’s processing power.
Traditional ‘teaching’ often hooks into mental processes such as logic and 
language. Other processes such as music and abstract thought are often 
linked with creativity. By using both sides of the brain or all intelligences, 
the learner is able to exploit the specialised capabilities of each, multiplying 
their learning power.
Of course, it is quite possible to be both logical and creative, if we define creativity as:
“A mental process that gives rise to a new idea”
Or even as:
“The process of finding a solution to a problem that is qualitatively different to a logical progression of 
the problem itself.”
In other words, finding solutions that are different to what you’d find if you just extended the problem 
logically.

I’ll go halves with you
We as human beings have evolved the ability to create solutions to problems which are different to what 
might be arrived at simply by linear extension of the problem. You have probably seen animals trying to 
solve a problem such as opening a door by trying the same thing, again and again. Sometimes they are 
successful through persistence. Human beings can sit back and reflect on the problem and create new 
solutions that are different, for example go a different way, pull the door instead of pushing.
We all have this creative ability, whether we regard ourselves as ‘creative’ or not. In fact, the word ‘creative’ 
has become so closely connected with the arts that many people do not regard themselves as creative 
just because they can’t draw in the way that they would like to.
The important point for you is that, in order to engage all mental processes, both halves of the brain 
must be engaged.
How? Well, you can use music and rhythm and charts and logic and physical movement. Or, if that’s not 
appropriate in your context then you can make sure that you use lots of colour and pictures. If you’re 
thinking “Ha! But he’s not using much colour” then you need to see the cost of colour printing!
You may or may not believe that your brain is specialised into halves, in fact some recent research suggests 
that most activities take place across the brain rather than being localised. This ties in with some quite 
old theories of memory which said that the brain works holographically – every memory is stored in 
every cell and with more connections or more cells comes faster access to those memories. As brain 
cells die off as we get older, memories don’t disappear, they just get harder to access. There may be some 
truth in this too, but the reality is that no one knows for sure what happens.
Whether you believe in two halves or not, what we can say for certain is that the more of your brain 
that you use, the better. “Whole brain” exercises can only be good, regardless of how they work, since 
they exercise your brain differently and get you to make new connections.
Does the brain have a logical side and a creative side? Personally, I’m not sure what difference it makes, 
unless you have some electrodes handy to give your delegates’ creative halves a zap from time to time.
All of these different theories on brain organisation are very useful to you – not because they’re true, but 
because they encourage you to apply some structure to the way that you create your learning experience 
to appeal to different learning styles and capabilities. Whichever theory you prefer, you can use it to 
check that your course design, environment and agenda satisfy the needs of a diverse range of learners.
You may also have heard of “brain gym” or “educational kinesiology” which uses physical exercise to 
influence brain function. It doesn’t take much for you to try a few out and decide for yourself which 
you like best.

Unless you’re training cookery, wine tasting or perfume mixing, the chances are that your audience will 
be mostly gathering information using three of their many senses:
Although we could also say that language is a special, additional sense.
Any one person will be preferring one of these, the whole audience will be a mixture and any one 
person will change from time to time. So, how can you structure your delivery to supply the maximum 
information to your audience, given that you have a natural preference too?
The answer is that you must structure your communication to appeal to all three of these sensory systems. 
You must also pay attention to times that the audience shifts from one system to another. You will find 
that you can influence this shift, and use it to communicate more powerfully. Here’s how.

Now it makes sense…
Firstly, how do you know which sensory system a person is using? Remember that the brain is gathering 
information using all of your senses, the preferred sense is the one that you are currently attending to 
consciously. Don’t assume that it’s connected to the training material, as we all have the ability to translate 
sensory information. Right now, you could be seeing the words, hearing them in your head or deciding 
how you feel about them.
As you might expect, NLP has special words for these three senses. They are Visual, Auditory and 
Kinaesthetic. In fact, NLP has a special phrase for the word ‘sense’. It is ‘representational system’ and it 
is meant to indicate that our senses are not reality, they only represent reality.
Our senses are not reality, they only represent reality. Therefore, they may or may not 
represent the same version of external events as other people’s senses. None of us can 
claim to have a full version of external events, as there is just too much information to 
handle consciously. Check out ‘Making Up the Mind: How the Brain Creates our Mental 
World’ by Chris Frith.
The internal processing of the brain is available to you externally as a set of ‘symptoms’. Here are the 
ones that we know about today – you may find some new ones:
Language
As you will know, our language structure contains many words that don’t add much to the meaning. In 
other words, meaning not need grammar. It is these structural words that we’re interested in. How many 
ways can someone say, “I understand”? Do these sound familiar?
I get it
I can grasp that
I see
That sounds good
I hear you
I’m with you
That’s crystal clear
I dig
That’s clear as a bell
Looks great
When you hear these, you might hear them as a confirmation of understanding, rather than paying 
attention to the words used. Well, start paying attention! Here are those phrases again, with their 
associated sensory system:
I get it
Feel
I see
See
I hear you
Hear
That’s crystal clear
See or Hear
That’s clear as a bell
Hear

Feel

See
When you next watch the news on TV, or listen to it on the radio, pay special attention to the unscripted 
interviews. Listen out for people using these words and their language will come alive with a new depth 
and meaning. Once you have had some practice at this, start matching their language up with the 
physiological symptoms described below. Of course, you can try this with real people too, it’s just that 
people on TV don’t seem to mind as much when you stare at them.
All of this is useful, not in categorising people, but in communicating with them more effectively. 
You may have heard people labelled as “visual” as if they are only able to understand pictures. In fact, 
everyone uses all of their senses. Imagine listening to a presentation in a language that you can speak, 
but not fluently. You translate in your head as much as you can, but after a while you can’t help letting 
your mind wander as you get tired.
The same thing happens even when you communicate using the same language, so we are talking 
about a degree of refinement here which will add to and enhance your existing skills, particularly when 
communicating something complex or new.
Here’s another list of words that will help you discover a person’s preferred sensory system. Preferred 
doesn’t necessarily mean “always use”, think of it as meaning “using right now”.

To a highly visual thinker, kinaesthetic thinkers appear to be slow and boring. The kinaesthetic thinker 
might feel that the visual thinker is too flighty, never settling on a particular idea or topic or conversation 
and talking too fast to pay much attention to.
Visual thinkers see a constant movie in their heads, so their language has to keep up. Strongly visual 
thinkers hardly ever finish a sentence, as the generation of words just can’t keep pace with the images 
they’re trying to describe. They breathe high and fast to keep up with their fast pace of speech, and their 
hand gestures show you what they are talking about. To make upward eye accessing more comfortable, 
they look up and lean back a lot, often supporting the backs of their heads with their hands when they 
are thinking very intensely.
Auditory thinkers hear a constant, harmonious flow of words and sounds. They tend to breathe regularly 
from the centre of their chest and their gestures add impact and emphasis to their words, much like 
the conductor of an orchestra. They talk smoothly and freely and you can hear a definite music to their 
speech, marking out sentences and phrases. Auditory thinkers tend to sit upright and when thinking 
intensely will often tilt their heads to one side.
Kinaesthetic thinkers base their language on their feelings, so they constantly check their internal feelings 
and sensations to verify what they are saying. Feelings move much more slowly than words or pictures, 
so a kinaesthetic thinker will tend to pause a lot and speak without making much eye contact. They 
tend to breathe slowly and deeply from their stomachs, and their rate of speech is much slower than the 
other two sensory thinking modes. Their hands will often be still, or they will touch themselves to stay 
“in touch” with their feelings. Kinaesthetic thinkers tend to lean forwards when thinking as this makes 
their downward eye accessing more comfortable.
During the course of a conversation, you will move freely between these different modes, although you 
will tend to prefer one as a “default” mode.

Now it makes sense…
You’ll find that, when you’re deeply in rapport with someone, your physical posture and breathing will 
be closely matched. Consequently, you will both be thinking in the same sensory mode. Next time you’re 
in a social environment like a pub, watch out for people who are this deeply in rapport.
The first thing you’ll notice is the similarity of their posture, but this is not the most important thing 
to pay attention to. Instead, notice the pace and rhythm of their movements. Notice how they are both 
using the same type and range of gestures, so that they are either both pointing to the same picture, both 
conducting the same orchestra or both checking the same kinds of feelings.
Essentially, they have entered a shared world – a bubble, within which they seem to have an almost 
telepathic connection.
Just watching this process in some detail will give you everything you need to know about the role your 
senses play in creating a shared reality for you and your delegates.
There are a number of elements to a particular state, so we’ll cover each one separately, looking at the 
“symptoms” that relate to each sensory system.

changes. Also, find someone who seems to naturally fit these descriptions and pay attention to how they 
describe their experiences.

Now it makes sense…
In general, movement to the left infers the recall of an existing memory whilst movement to the right 
infers the construction of a new experience. Contrary to what the members of some security forces are 
told, this doesn’t apply to everyone, and it certainly doesn’t mean that someone is lying, just because 
they’re making new pictures in their head. With some people, the left to right accessing is exactly reversed 
so, once again, it’s important to pay attention to the person in front of you, not the generalisation. In 
fact, recent research shows that there is no connection between eye movements and lying (PloS One, 
vol 7, pe40259).
If you want to test this out, find yourself a willing subject and sit down, face to face somewhere quiet. 
You can ask them these questions, or make up your own more relevant questions. The important thing 
about this exercise is that they don’t have to answer you, they only have to process the question.
You should memorise each question and then look the person right in the eye as you ask it. If you read 
from the page, you will miss the eye accessing as it will happen as soon as the person understands the 
question – which is long before you have finished reading it.
• What colour is your bedroom?
• Where is the bed in relation to the window?
• What would your bedroom look like if it were pink? (i.e. not the current colour)
• When you pull back the curtains, what sound do they make?
• What sound would they make if you pulled them back twice as fast?
• What sound would they make if you pulled them back half as fast?
• What do they feel like?
• How easily do the curtains move?
• What can you feel with your toes?
• How do you feel when you hear the sound of chalk on blackboard?
• How does your favourite person’s voice make you feel?
• Repeat this to yourself inside your head “Mary had a little lamb”
• Repeat this to yourself inside your head, using the voice of Donald Duck “Mary had a little 
lamb”
• What’s the time? (without looking!)
You will probably notice your subject’s eyes moving about rather than going to one place and staying 
there. This is an example of something known as a ‘pattern’. For example, if you asked the question “How 
easily do the curtains move?”, your subject may look up to the left, then up to the right, then down to the 
right before answering. This indicated them trying to remember seeing their curtains move, then making 
up a picture of their curtains, then finally checking the image against the feelings in their muscles. You 
can check your interpretation with them after they answer the question.

Now it makes sense…
As you might suspect, all of these are related to each other. If someone is making pictures in their head, 
their eyes move up so to get comfortable they lean back. In order to keep pace with the rapidly moving 
pictures in their head, they have to talk fast and this is supported by rapid, shallow breathing which comes 
from the upper ribcage. If someone is concentrating on feelings, they look down and to really concentrate 
hard they lean forwards. Feelings change much more slowly than pictures, so their breathing becomes 
deep and slow to quieten any movement in their bodies, allowing them to really focus on their feelings.
You may have already noticed that I seem to say the same thing in a number of ways. This 
helps to make communication loud, clear and easy to grasp. In other words, it helps you 
see what I mean, hear what I’m saying and get the hang of it.
Are you getting the picture yet? Does it ring a bell? Do you get it?
This is an easy way for you to communicate with a group of people who are each 
attending to you with their eyes, their ears and their feelings.
Now that we’ve been through all that, I can reveal the secret to you:
Don’t worry about it. I mean, don’t give it any further thought.

What’s more important is that you pay attention to your audience’s state and that you notice when the 
state shifts. If you spend all your time trying to work out people’s eye accessing, you’re missing the point 
of paying more attention to other people.
My advice on this whole chapter is to simply be aware that people do not speak the same language as 
you do, even though it sounds the same. Language conveys experience and other people’s experiences 
are not the same as yours. Pay attention to the differences and use them to become a more effective, 
more empathic communicator.

Whatever you do, don’t
20	 Whatever you do, don’t
Before we start, don’t think of a pink elephant, don’t notice that itch and whatever you do, don’t make 
a mistake.
Our brains are analogue computers. In practice, this means that, like Roman numerals, we cannot 
represent zero. We can only represent the absence of something within a framework of the thing that 
is missing.
Here is an empty box.
What was in it?
Here is another empty box.
What was in it?
So, hopefully you get the 
idea.
Oranges
Computers work digitally, so computers can quite happily cope with “not zero”, which is most definitely 
the number one. Analogue computers struggle to understand “not zero” as it essentially means “anything 
at all except zero” – for example one, two, a hundred, a tomato, a goldfish or an itch. Are you starting to 
understand the problem with the word don’t? Well, don’t worry about it too much if you’re not.
Have you ever said something like that in a learning context? Don’t worry, don’t try too hard or maybe 
even “don’t do that.”
There are two fundamental problems with the word don’t. The first is that our brains cannot make sense 
of the language without first representing that thing that the word “don’t” applies to. In order to decode 
the language “don’t drop the glass” your brain first has to have a representation of what dropping the 
glass is like in order to know what not dropping it means. That thought alone leads to tiny, involuntary 
relaxation of the muscles in your hand as you make a picture of the glass dropping. The result? You 
drop the glass.

Whatever you do, don’t
The second problem is that telling someone what you don’t want them to do gives them absolutely no 
useful information about what you do want them to do. Ask a decorator to paint your bedroom “not blue” 
if you want to test this out. At best, you will create confusion. At worst, you’ll get a punch on the nose.
Of course, your objective may be to create confusion, in which case don’t think about applying any of 
the information in this chapter.
Whilst our brains are analogue computers, they do operate within rules of context. If you tell someone 
“don’t use a red pen” then they will create a list of alternative behaviours constrained by the context of 
the language. They will guess that you either mean use a green/blue/black pen or that you mean use a 
red pencil/crayon. If you say, “don’t do that” then they will search for a meaning based on “what am I 
doing right now?”
If you ask someone to stop an annoying habit by saying, “don’t do that” then they will have no context 
on which to base alternative behaviour. The habit is unconscious – that’s what makes it a habit – so they 
may have no awareness of what they are doing. On the other hand, they might just be deliberately trying 
to annoy you. It’s always worth checking.

Whatever you do, don’t
If you catch yourself saying “don’t”, quickly backtrack inside your head to figure out how you have decided 
on this course of action. Usually, you will have made a picture, sound, voice or feeling inside your head 
of how things may turn out for the worst. Go back to that worry state and pick a more useful, specific 
outcome. Now follow up your “don’t” command with a “do” command.
Here’s an example:
• Watch people working on a lively exercise dangerously close to the projector
• Make a picture in your head of them knocking it over
• Say “don’t knock the projector over”
• Realise you said “don’t”
• Backtrack to the picture in your head
• Choose an alternative, positive outcome
• Make a picture in your head of that outcome
• Describe the picture – for example, “move away from the projector”
So you avoid the usual “What projector?”…Bang…“Oh, that projector…”
Now, once you get the hang of telling people what you want you can start being more creative with your 
use of the word “don’t”. For example, if you tell someone “don’t forget”, you can imagine the result you 
might get. You could have some fun with this, and it’s an interesting way to experiment with motivating 
people, but don’t start thinking about all the ways you’ll use what you’ve learned just yet.

Anxiety
A fear of public speaking is the single most common problem I am presented with in coaching. What 
I have found over the years is that the structure seems to fall into two broad categories. Some people 
start having an internal conversation with themselves whilst presenting and this creates conflict and 
distraction. Some people imagine that the audience is judging them badly.
In the first case, I find it’s helpful to give people strategies for remembering their presentations which 
match their own natural preferences. For example, if someone has a visual preference but they write their 
presentation out as a script, they have to stop their flow in order to read the script. Instead, I would get 
them to draw their presentation out using pictures or use single words per topic.
In the second case, when I ask what happens when they stand up in front of the audience they often say, 
“I imagine the audience is looking at me”, to which I reply, “well, that’s because they are!”.
What is often happening is that the presenter is seeing themselves from the audience’s point of view and 
noticing all of their faults. The Perceptual Positions technique is ideal in this situation.
Imagine yourself giving a presentation. In 1st position, you are standing at the front of the 
audience, seeing them, hearing them, hearing yourself, noticing what you feel.
Move to a 2nd perceptual position, sitting in the audience looking up at yourself. As you sit in the 
audience, look around you and then look at yourself at the front of the room. Notice what you 
see and hear, and notice how you feel.
Move to a 3rd perceptual position as a neutral observer, at the back of the room or perhaps 
looking in through a door or window. Notice the way that ‘you’ in the audience interacts with 
and responds to ‘you’ at the front of the room.
Move back through 2nd position and finally into 1st position, taking with you anything you have 
noticed or learned.
Taking in what you noticed in the 3rd and 2nd positions, what seems different as you deliver your 
presentation now?
At this stage, most people will observe that the audience had far more important things to think about 
than the presenters minor habits and mistakes. And from the 3rd position, it all seemed quite distant 
and unimportant. Back in 1st position, most people will feel more of a balance in their relationship with 
the audience. Yes, the audience is looking at them, but they’re not making as harsh a judgement as the 
presenter is making of themselves.

Setting the scene
What do audiences want to know? What meanings should all presentations convey regardless of topic 
or content? What about:
• I’m telling the truth
• You can trust me
• This is important to you
• This is relevant to you
• I really believe in this
• You’re going to love this!
It might be useful to think about the high level message that runs through you presentations, and to 
consider that first when you are planning a presentation. If you get that in place, everything else you do 
has a strong foundation to build on.
Your context
Take a moment to set your own personal context for presenting with impact – is it to clients, colleagues, 
shareholders or someone else? Are you selling, persuading, informing or something else?

It’s also worth thinking about what the audience expect from you. Do they expect an expert, or just a 
different perspective? Do they expect a hero or a fall guy?
Planning outcomes
If you don’t want your audience to do anything as a result of your presentation then you are wasting your 
time and theirs. An email could replace your presentation if all you want to do is transmit information. 
A presentation is a specialised communication tool, so use it to achieve the right outcome for you. Think 
carefully about what the presentation adds, over and above any other form of communication.
Even a decision or an opinion is an action because it requires the audience to process information and 
then do something. Forming an opinion is an active process, just as much as buying a product.
• What do I want?
• How will the people in this room help me to get it?
• What do I need them to do for me?
• What state do they need to be in to achieve that?
When you create a Well Formed Outcome for your presentation, you’ll know it has to be under your 
control. If you want the audience to understand or agree, that’s not under your control, so first you have 
to know what it is you want.
So many people in companies present to customers to ‘inform’ or ‘educate’. That’s not under your control!
If we work outwards in layers of control, the first thing that is under your control is your own state. 
When you’re in rapport with the audience, your state will influence their state and their state will make 
it easier for them to achieve the outcome you want for them.
Aside from all the influencing tricks you could learn, the simplest way to get people to do what you want 
is to tell them what you want. It’s important to get into the habit of telling people clearly what you want 
and what you need from them. The final question, a ‘tag question’ just pushes the outcome home as it 
tends to elicit an agreeable response in the majority of helpful, reasonable people. The important thing 
is that it elicits a response – because you do want a responsive audience, don’t you?
If you ask for something that people can’t give you, they will tell you – either by saying “no” or by saying 
“erm…OK” whilst looking like they mean ‘no’.

Many people are afraid to ask for what they want. That’s OK, because if everyone asked for what they 
want, there would be too much noise. It’s good that many people are brought up by their parents to 
believe that accepting second best, accepting what they’re given is somehow a good thing. This means 
that it’s very easy to get what you want, just by asking for it. It’s precisely because other people are afraid 
to do it that it works so nicely.
And you’re not afraid to get what you want, are you?
Of course, there is another explanation. Imagine for a moment that the world is full of people who are 
reasonably happy, well intentioned, kind and helpful. They want to help you, as long as what you’re asking 
for doesn’t specifically disadvantage them. They want to help you, but they don’t know how. So by telling 
them what you want, you are helping them to help you, which makes them happy.
After all, you feel happy when you’ve helped someone, don’t you?
Oh, by the way, I really am suggesting you start every presentation in this way.
“What I want is for you to think about how this is important for your business, so what I need you to 
do is pay attention and ask any questions that help you to understand how we can work together, how 
do you feel about that?
Years ago, I worked with a client who had problems with internal communication. They had a board 
meeting every two months where they would cover all of their project updates and make all of their 
important decisions. The meeting essentially comprised two days of presentations.
What was happening was this: someone would present a project update and at the end certain people 
would start asking awkward questions, saying they had forgotten something, questioning their approach, 
saying they should do something different, generally picking the project apart and making the presenter 
feel like they were under attack. The presenter would exclaim “but all of this was in the agenda, didn’t 
you read it?” Of course, no-one ever did read the agenda. They were too busy.
Someone else would present some information for a decision – something simple like buying mobile 
phones. They would go through tariffs, figures, suppliers and so on, and at the end of the presentation as 
the board to make a decision. More questions. “Have you talked to that supplier?”, “Why are you doing 
it that way?”, “Why don’t you talk to this supplier?”, “Why are you looking at those phones?”, “What’s 
the cost of calling another mobile on that one?”. The presenter would exclaim “but all of this was in the 
agenda, didn’t you read it?” Of course, no-one ever did read the agenda. They were too busy.

And meeting after meeting, decisions didn’t get made, projects didn’t move forwards and everyone 
learned to feel a sense of dread when it was time for the next meeting.
The solution was very simple, and I bet you can guess what it was. The presenters weren’t telling the 
audience how to listen, they weren’t telling the audience what they needed to do. So each person in the 
audience settled into their default role – to fall asleep, or to challenge, or to show that the presenter 
hadn’t really thought it through, or whatever it was.
It didn’t help that the presentations were all jumbled together, so the audience would never really 
understand what the point of the next one would be. It’s no wonder they were confused and just retreated 
to their comfort zones.
What I had them do instead was begin each presentation with a framing statement, such as:
“Here is an update on my project, I don’t need any advice or feedback at this stage, it’s for your information 
only”
“I’m going to present information about the mobile phone purchasing project, and at the end I want you 
to tell me which supplier you think we should use”

Saying, “Here is an update on my project, I don’t need any advice or feedback at this stage, it’s for your 
information only” tells people exactly what is expected of them. Conversely, presenting a huge volume 
of facts and figures and only then asking people to make a decision is simply asking for trouble. If you 
tell people up front what you expect, they will pay attention in the right places and be able to make 
a decision when you need them to, instead of saying they need more time to think or asking difficult 
questions just to divert attention away from the fact that they weren’t listening.
Of course, you could do even better than this. You could make sure your presentation is even more 
focused and impactful. Using the examples above:
“I’m here to give you an update on my project. What do you need to know in order to feel comfortable 
updating your own teams on our progress?”
“I’m asking you to make a decision on which mobile phone supplier we use. What information do you 
need from me to make that decision?”
When does the presentation start?
When do you think the trance induction begins for a stage hypnosis show? When the hypnotist first 
addresses the audience? In the music that is playing before the show starts? Upon entering the theatre, 
even? The answer is that it starts the moment you buy your ticket.
When does a night out with friends start? As you walk into the bar? As you’re getting ready? As you’re 
getting ready to leave work?
When does your holiday start? When you step off the plane? Or when you book it?
Why is this? Because as soon as you start to think about something like a night out, or a holiday, or a 
presentation, you are building a simulation of it in your mind. As soon as you make the decision, your 
mind begins preparing you for it. That preparation might include wondering who will be there, thinking 
about what might happen, feeling excited, thinking about what you want to learn, thinking about how 
to get there.
We survive by predicting the future. Our ability to catch balls and trains requires the future to be much 
the same as the past, so we create generalised rules that apply over time. The problem is that we predict 
the future based on past events, and as the people who manage your investments say, that is a very risky 
approach.
It’s a completely natural, human process, and by being aware of it, you gain greater control.

Putting it all together
You will be communicating with your audience long before you stand up to speak to them, so it’s very 
important that you start shaping their expectations to support your outcome.
If you ask, many people will say that the presentation starts when they stand up to speak.
This is unhelpful for two reasons:
• It puts even more focus on the act of standing up, which is the bit most people avoid
• It loses a huge opportunity to influence the audience and set their expectations
What communication do you have with the audience before the presentation that you can use to reinforce 
your presentation?
Do you send out an agenda? A joining pack? An email? Each of these is an opportunity to prepare the 
audience for your presentation so that you have a much greater chance of achieving what you want from it.
If you tell the audience what to expect, they will adjust their ability to pay attention accordingly.
If you don’t they will pay attention to whatever fits their preconceived expectations, which means you 
will get random results at best.
Set the audience’s expectations as soon as you begin communicating with them.
As you stand up, you step into an imaginary space at the front of the room, created by the audience. 
The existence of an audience presupposes the existence of a presenter – and so you are stepping into a 
role that is waiting for you to claim it.
As you step into that space, you take control of the room, and you do not under any circumstances give 
control back to the audience until you are ready to.
Planning states
What will be the starting state of the audience? Open minded? Curious? Impatient?
Many presenters just launch in and start talking at the audience instead of first tuning themselves into 
the audience’s state. This is one of the most important things you can do as a professional communicator 
and it’s called pacing.
Begin by thinking about the audience’s starting state. Then, thinking about the desired outcome for the 
presentation, choose a useful end state for the audience. Finally, plan a route.

It is very important to be realistic about the audience’s start state. You might want them to be curious, 
but if the reality is that they are tired and bored then you can take that into account. Remember; their 
start state is neither good nor bad, it’s just the way that it is, and it has nothing to do with you.
Their start state will depend not just on what has happened to them prior to the presentation, but also on 
their expectations of the presentation itself based on their previous experiences. This is a very important 
point too, and illustrates the importance of knowing when the presentation starts.
You will probably recognise this as an extension of the concept of pacing and leading, and you’ll remember 
that the first stage of pacing is to gain rapport. If the audience is feeling critical, there’s no point pretending 
they are curious. First you need to pace their critical state in order to lead them out of it. How do you 
do that? Come on! Do you want me to come and do the presentation for you?

Putting it all together
Presenters who don’t have the advantage of this approach often start by planning what they want to 
say rather than how they want the audience to respond. This is why their presentations seem more like 
transmissions than interactions.
What about technical presentations? Surely they serve to inform or instruct the audience? Again, what 
do you want them to do with that information? Agree with it? Make a decision? Understand it? Use it? 
Misuse it?
The outcome for the audience is always your starting point for designing a presentation. Once you know 
this, the rest is easy.
What the audience wants
What do audiences want to know? What meanings should all presentations convey regardless of topic 
or content?
Are there some silent, hidden questions that the audience need answering before they can begin to 
listen? You know there are. They’re the same questions that you were asking as we started this workshop.
As you begin your presentation, the people in the audience have these questions rattling around in their 
minds. They are probably not consciously aware of them, yet they still need to be answered.
They are questions like:
• Do we have anything in common?
• Do I like you?
• Do I trust you?
Download free eBooks at bookboon.com

NLP – Skills for Learning
116 
Putting it all together
• Do I believe you?
• Do you believe you?
• Do you know what you’re talking about?
• Is this relevant to me?
• Do I respect you?
There may be other questions too, depending on the situation.
How do you know that you like someone? Is it because they say “You can like me” or is it something else?
It might be useful to think about the high level message that runs through you presentations, and to 
consider that first when you are planning a presentation. If you get that in place, everything else you do 
has a strong foundation to build on.
By giving the audience the opportunity to find the answers to these questions first of all, you will ensure 
their full attention later on. It really is worth investing time in this, because that investment will pay off 
greatly later on, as you will soon discover.
Environment
Bear in mind that the environment you’re presenting in will greatly influence the audience and your 
outcomes, particularly if you plan the environment in conjunction with the audience’s expectations.
You can think not only about the venue and room but also branding and signs which add to the 
expectations of the audience.
You can also think about things like refreshments, using a lectern and so on. If you stand behind a 
lectern, you will lose rapport with the audience because they can’t see you. If you have water available, 
you can use it to give yourself time to think about questions.
The environment can support or hinder you in achieving your outcome, so it’s worth taking some time 
to think about it.
Structuring the presentation
There are a number of formats that you can use to establish communication with the audience. Here 
are a few ideas for you to practice. Remember that success, in NLP terms, doesn’t mean thinking about 
what will work and ruling out what you think won’t – it means that you do everything and notice what 
really works!

Framing
By telling people what you want them to do, you are helping them to filter the information so that they 
pay attention to what is important for them. If you don’t tell people what to do until the end, they will 
be completely unprepared for it and will not do what you ask. This process is called labelling or framing, 
and it’s often used naturally by anyone who is a skilled communicator.
• I’m going to present some information after which I’d like you to give me your opinion.
• I’m going to present a project update after which I’d like you to give me feedback.
• I’m going to present a proposal to you after which I’d like you to make a decision.
Outcome focus
There’s an old saying used by old presentation skills trainers: tell them what you’re going to tell them, tell 
them, then tell them what you’ve told them. In other words, the audience have a limited attention span 
so you have to drum your message into them. Here’s an updated version, for a more modern audience:
• Tell them what you want them to do
• Present the information they need in order to do it
• Tell them what you want them to do

Association (shifting referential index)
Begin talking about the wider context, people in general, then move to a more relevant section of the 
population, then to the people in the room, then to ‘you’ and finally to ‘I’. Throughout the sequence, the 
referential index shifts as follows:
Everyone (everything) > them > us > you > I
Timeframe
Begin at some point in time before the present moment, listing all the shared experiences up until the 
present moment to elicit and agreement state, then continue forward in time to gain commitment to a 
course of action.
Frame/story/question
Frame the communication to direct the audience’s attention, tell a short story and then ask a question 
to shift the audience’s state and refocus their attention.
Pacing current experience
The first thing you need to achieve in your presentation is to get the audience’s attention. You can ask 
questions, tell them about yourself, use an ice breaker, tell a joke, or do anything else that fits the context.
One very useful way to achieve this is to build your audience towards an ‘agreement state’ in which 
they are more likely to agree with you, consider your ideas favourably and make the decisions you want 
them to make.
So, right now, you’re reading these words and you might think about your next presentation. Perhaps you’ve 
presented in the past, or experienced other people presenting to you. In either case, you may be the kind 
of person who really wants to achieve the best you can and refine the skills you’re already developing. It’s 
good that you’re taking such an active interest in yourself because you know the results that it will bring you.
Was there anything in that last paragraph that you could disagree with? Was there anything to agree with?
In the first section we talked about pacing the audience’s state. This is the same process, and this time 
you’re pacing their experience. As you begin with very general facts that are true for the audience, you 
will see them nodding in agreement. As your presentation becomes more specific, or less factual, they 
will be more likely to agree with you than to disagree. For example, to say that you’re reading about 
presentation skills is true. To say that you’re reading the best way to develop your presentation skills is 
a belief. Your beliefs – product benefits, opinions or proposals – are more likely to be accepted if your 
audience is in an agreement state.

Putting it all together
When practicing hypnosis, we use a simple script that rotates the client between their external experience 
and their internal focus:
Tell your partner three things that you know they can see/hear/feel
Tell your partner one thing that may be true – a suggestion
Ask your partner what they are aware of
Repeat 4 or 5 times
Why would we mention hypnosis in a chapter on presenting? Let’s put it into the context of a presentation:
Tell the audience three things that are true now or are shared experience
Tell the audience one thing that may be true – a suggestion
Ask the audience for their agreement
And you might still be wondering what this has to do with presenting, so here are a couple of examples, 
starting with something that I hear at almost every sales conference.
• It’s been a tough year
• Competition has been intense
• We’ve worked hard
• Your targets are doubling next yearLeadership is key to business success
• Effective leaders inspire their staff
• Leaders can be both born and bred
Excellerate develops your leadership potentialIt’s always useful to have your audience in an agreeable 
state before you start transmitting information at them. This simple technique is a very powerful way to 
lead the audience into an agreeable state by telling them things that are true – either in their experience 
or in the present moment, for example:
• You have all travelled to be here today
• We are all together
• You can hear me
• You can take a moment to be comfortable
• We have some presentations before lunch
• Some of you might be curious
• Some of you may already know
• I know that you may be wondering
• You might be wondering, “what do I do with this?”

And of course, when the audience is in an agreeable state, they are more likely to agree with you.
Chunk size
You can start at a high level of detail and work down throughout your presentation, giving the audience 
the opportunity to ‘tune in’ when you reach their preferred level of detail.
Tell the audience the purpose of your presentation, what you want to achieve and what they need to do 
to help you.
Start with background, big picture, landscape, ‘true’ information. Talk about the wider context to your 
presentation, both what’s good and what’s missing from it.
Move onto the detail of your presentation, what you are presenting, what problems it solves, what it 
achieves, how that helps the audience, what it does for them.
Summarise the key points, information, benefits, outcomes. Tell the audience what you want to achieve 
and what they need to do to help you.

Timing
It’s more important to stick to time than to say everything you want to say. The audience will be left with 
a far better impression if they feel the presentation is complete than if there is any sense of something 
being left out.
As a rule of thumb, when you plan your presentation content, create enough content to fill about three 
quarters of your allocated time. The rest of that time will most certainly be taken up by late starts, 
questions, conversations and all the other unexpected things that happen whenever you work with 
children, animals or audiences.
It is very easy to fill in time during a presentation, and by finishing early you give the impression of 
being very much in control – something that the audience will notice and appreciate.
If you have any activities or interactive sessions planned for your presentation, build in even more 
contingency, so that you create content for only half of the allocated time.
Many people take the approach that they have a lot to say about themselves and their companies, and it’s 
very hard to pack all that into a short time. Certainly, if you believe that the function of a presentation is 
for you to tell the audience something, or give them information, then you will certainly find it difficult 
to pack in everything you have to say.
Let’s take a different approach – one that takes a lot of pressure off you and makes the whole experience 
far more enjoyable. Simply ask yourself this question:
What one question can I ask that will get the audience to do what I want them to do?
After that, the only remaining question is what to do to pad out the remaining time!
If your set up and invitations have done their job, the audience already knows why they are there and 
what they need to do what they are there for. If someone asks you to make a decision, you already know 
what information you need. You don’t have to sit through a comprehensive presentation of information 
which is very useful, it’s just not useful for you. If the audience needs only some very specific information 
in order to take action, why waste time?
Here are some examples:
• What one thing can I tell you about my company that will most help you make the right 
decision?
• What information will be most useful to you right now?
• What can we do in this next hour that will make this whole presentation worthwhile?

Putting it all together
Starting from the point of cramming in everything there is to say is difficult. Starting from the point of 
what your audience needs to hear in order to take the next step is easy.
So, here is a useful idea for you. Always start your presentations with a question:
What would you most like to hear about that will be most helpful or useful for you right now?
By concentrating on the answer to that question, timing will never be a problem for you.
Language patterns
You can try out some different forms of language to find out the effect they have on the audience. Here 
are some examples.
Presuppositions
All language contains unspoken elements which must be accepted as true in order for the language to 
make grammatical sense. You can use this constructively, for example:
“When you buy a service like mine, what do you normally expect?”
The question is about customer expectation, but it makes no grammatical sense if the listener does not 
buy ‘a service like mine’.
Reframes
Reframing can be used to change the meaning of information, for example, if the price of a product is 
high you can reframe that information to mean the price is an indication of exclusivity.
You can respond to even the most pointed objection or question with, “Excellent! What a great question”, 
because it’s important to recognise the value of the person even if their question may be inappropriate.
In coaching, you can use reframes to change the meaning of problems. I was recently asking a client to 
use their creativity to come up with options for a problem. One option was, “Move to a planet orbiting 
Mars” and my reply was, “Excellent! Your creative side is working really well!”
Whatever your audience does or says is good because it shows they are engaged. If they fall asleep, that’s 
good too as they’ll be easier to influence. You can’t lose!

Embedded commands
These are instructions that sit within a language structure that is not itself a command. Often, analogue 
marking is used to draw unconscious attention to the command. The simplest embedded commands 
are questions:
When would you make a decision to buy my product?
What would you need to know in order to hire me?
But they can also be more complex:
I know that sometimes it seems difficult to make a decision, yet when you realise you’re looking at the 
best product you just have to go for it and trust yourself to do the right thing for you.
The embedded commands are marked out using a gesture or vocal stress or even a pause, in exactly the 
same way that you would naturally stress important points in any conversation.

Milton Model language
Milton Model language is a framework within which the listener can insert their own meaning. It is 
very powerful in situations where you have to address the needs of interests of many different people, 
for example:
You may have heard about this before or it may be new to you, in either case you might already be thinking 
about how to use this information and to learn even more before you make the right decision for you.
Questions
Can you think of an easy way to engage the audience and make the presentation interactive?
You might recall that we each have a critical filter which evaluates incoming information to judge it 
against our own beliefs and perception of the world.
The filter is useful because it protects us from other people’s beliefs. Unfortunately, it also prevents us 
from accepting new information too.
This means that if you present by talking facts at your audience, it doesn’t matter how true or well 
researched you think those facts are, some people in the audience will find them contentious, simply as 
a result of the way you have presented them.
Fortunately, we can bypass this filter quite easily. Firstly, you can make sure that the people you’re 
presenting to are in as receptive a state as possible before you begin presenting. How? Come on – you 
can remember!
• Using every opportunity to communicate with the audience prior to the presentation
• Framing the presentation so the audience know what to do
• Answering the audience’s unspoken questions

Secondly, you can use the two forms of communication which will bypass the critical filter. The first 
we’ll explore is the question.
Why do questions bypass the critical filter? How do questions bypass the critical filter?
Well, questions don’t convey any information, do they?
Questions don’t carry instructions, do they?
A structure of language which you hear as a question puts you into a certain frame of mind, ready to 
search for an answer. Over time, the right balance of questions will guide your audience into a receptive, 
open minded and interactive state.
We hear questions when:
• The speaker’s voice pitch and eyebrows rise towards the end of a sentence, not to be 
confused with a stereotypical Australian accent which is different
• A sentence starts with a word such as why, when, where, how, what, which, who, if, is, 
could, would, might, may, can
• A statement ends with a tag question, such as couldn’t it?, don’t they?, do we?, can it?
After all, it’s rarely wise to position yourself as a the absolute expert who is going to give the audience 
all the answers. It’s generally useful to think of your role as being to help the audience to explore the 
questions, and for them to formulate their answers. As you’ll see later, people rarely ask a question in 
order to get a straight answer.
And in any case, an answer is rarely as simple as it seems. We ask questions because the answers mean 
something, not because they’re plain facts. There is no such thing as a plain fact.

Consider these facts:
• 30 mph
• 2%
• 2 metres
How do you feel about them? Good? Bad? Indifferent?
You see, in themselves they don’t mean anything, but in context they can generate strong emotions. 
How about:
• Someone driving at 30 mph in a 20 mph area past a school at 8:55 am
• Being stuck behind someone driving at 30mph in a 60 mph zone when you have to catch a 
train
So questions not only bypass the audience’s critical filters – they have the power to elicit very strong 
emotional responses.
Narrative communication

Putting it all together
• Belief statements – which sometimes sounds like facts
• Questions – for many different reasons
• Narrative – which gives characters and sequence
This is a very important point. Human beings communicate with each other in a narrative. We don’t 
communicate using factual statements; they are linked by a narrative, which includes characters – who 
did what to who – and a sequence in time, so that we can recreate the situation mentally.
As one person is talking, anyone listening is translating their words back into the original sensory 
experience. Of course, they can’t translate it into exactly the original, so they are substituting their own 
experiences and references in order to make sense of it.
What does this mean for you as a presenter?
For a start, it means that the more narrative you use, the easier you are to listen to.
Secondly, it means that the richer your narrative, the more accurate are the pictures you create in your 
audience’s mind.
And thirdly, when we ask people on workshops what qualities they associate with excellent presenters, 
one which always comes out is that the presenter knew a lot about their subject. And when we ask how 
they knew that the presenter knew a lot – they told stories.
So storytelling is vital, it’s natural, you already do it and to be an excellent presenter you can do more 
of it, purposefully.
Right now, you communicate in many ways that already fit this form, including:
• Anecdotes
• Case studies
• Reports
• Any description of an event
Framing your communication
Effective communicators use a technique called ‘framing’, in which they direct your attention before they 
tell you the important bit, so you don’t miss it. For example,
• I’m going to present some information after which I’d like you to give me your opinion.
• I’m going to present a project update after which I’d like you to give me feedback.
• I’m going to present a proposal to you after which I’d like you to make a decision.

Putting it all together
By telling people what you want them to do, you are helping them to filter the information so that they 
pay attention to what is important for them. If you don’t tell people what to do until the end, they will 
be completely unprepared for it and will not do what you ask.
This is totally different to explaining what the story is about, because that destroys the power of the story, 
and you must never ever explain a story after you have told it, for a very simple reason.
When you communicate in this narrative way, you create a vivid experience in the mind of the listener 
who then determines a subjective meaning from it. If you the explain the story, your meaning will be 
different to theirs, and the disagreement breaks rapport and distances the audience from you, undoing 
the good work you have done by telling the story in the first place.
For example, the ‘right’ way to do this: “Have you noticed how much rail safety is in the news lately? 
Recently, when were surveying passengers, I was surprised to find that when we asked…”
And the ‘wrong’ way: “Now I’m going to tell you a story about how important safety is to rail passengers. 
In a recent survey, 58% of respondents indicated…”
You might notice many comedians using the same pattern, for example, “Have you noticed how policemen 
are getting younger? The other day, I was pulled over for speeding. I stopped and wound the window 
down. I thought it was nice that the policeman bent down to my level, then I realised that actually he 
was standing up on his tricycle. Instead of buying a ticket to the police ball, he asked me to handover 
my bag of sweets”
Nested loops
Hypnotic change stories can come in the form of a nested loop, where a suggestion is embedded within 
another story. A format using two nested stories looks like this:
Start 
story 1
Start 
story 2
Suggestion
End 
story 2
End 
story 1
Nested loops can be complex to set up and require rehearsal, yet can be very powerful when used well. 
It’s certainly worth practising these ideas to find out what works best for you.
Reframing and conversational belief change
Reframing is an excellent way to handle questions and objections. For example, the price of a product 
or service is in itself meaningless – it is the audience’s perception of it being cheap, expensive or good 
value that is important. Reframing allows you to change that subjective meaning in order to create the 
right outcome for your presentation.

Presentation aids
Environment
How can you use the physical environment to help you achieve your outcome? You might think about 
the location of chairs, tables, refreshment, signs, posters – anything that will support you and make it 
easier for you to achieve your outcome.
In Derren Brown‘s Mind Control TV series, he gets some creative designers to come up with an idea 
for a brand. Of course, the branding, images and logos were very similar to what he had already drawn 
and sealed in an envelope, but how? He had carefully planned their journey from their office to his, with 
posters, stickers, logos on children’s sweatshirts, items in shop windows and parcels carried by couriers 
to influence their thoughts. How could you do the same in your presentation?
Visual aids
You’ve probably seen a presentation where the presenter read out the words on the screen verbatim, and 
you probably thought, “I could read that myself…”
The more words you put on the screen, the less the audience will pay attention to you. When you put 
words on a slide, the first thing the audience will do is read the words. While they’re doing that, they’re 
not listening to you.
If you want to include a presentation script or detailed notes, put them into notes pages, not the main 
slides. Think of slides as signposts rather than guidebooks and you’ll be on the right track.
What other presentation aids can you use to enhance the overall experience?
Computer projected slides
Easy and quick to create, easy to share a common layout or style, easy to change when you find out new 
information five minutes before your presentation!
Whiteboards
Good for keeping track of meetings or informal ‘chalk and talk’ sessions, not so good for presentations 
as you have to turn your back to the audience to use them, and you can’t prepare your presentation 
beforehand.

Putting it all together
Flipcharts
Good for presentations as you can write them beforehand, use different colours, draw pictures etc, and 
you can face the audience while using it. Not as easy to change or update as whiteboards.
Portfolios/desktop flipcharts
Good for product information but be wary of forcing your audience through your standard presentation 
pitch.
Music
Very effective for managing your audience’s state. Don’t underestimate its power.
Anything that’s to hand!
You can use anything to highlight or add some extra dimension to your presentation. The obvious 
example is product samples or models, but you can use anything you want to give your presentation 
some extra impact.
Overall, the more ways you can communicate with the audience, the more memorable your presentation 
will be.

Motivation
Some people are motivated towards outcomes, others away from drawbacks. Towards people will be 
motivated by benefits and will tend to rush into decisions without weighing up the consequences. Away 
from people will be motivated by savings or avoidance and will tend hold back because of potential 
problems.
Reference
Some people make decisions based on internal information, others on external information. Internal 
people use their own experience and tend to think this applies to everyone. External people rely on other 
people or sources of information.
Choice
Some people need options, others need processes. Options people need alternatives and will create their 
own if they feel restricted. They often do things in a seemingly random order. Process people need step 
by step procedures and need to do things in the right order.
Everyone has a preference, and this can be influenced by context and state. Whilst you can quickly profile 
the people in your audience, the safest approach is to make sure you cover all preferences.
Make a decision because it achieves x and avoids y. You already know that you need to do this because 
everyone is doing it. By doing this the right way, you’re giving yourself more choice.
Personal tuning
Congruence
Congruence between your words, movements and words could be the most important aspect of presenting 
with impact. Similarly, incongruence can be a useful technique worth practicing.
Voice
You can have a much greater degree of control over your voice than you might have imagined – not 
just the volume but also the location in your body where your voice resonates. You can practice moving 
your voice around your body and listening to the difference it makes. When you are well balanced and 
breathing properly, your voice will be at its most resonant and compelling.
Balance
It’s important to be well balanced, with your centre of gravity well centred. Not only does this mean you 
can move fluidly, it gives an impression of great presence.

Stage presence
What is stage presence? Presenting like you mean it, owning the space, voice, posture, gestures.
Stage presence is simply a state, and you already know many ways to access useful states. It’s useful to 
set up anchors for useful states so that you can access them easily during your presentation.
Firstly, think of the specific state you want to access. ‘Confident’ is quite vague, and 
overconfidence can be as harmful as nervousness.
Remember a specific time when you were in this state. Remember what you saw, how bright 
it is, how sharp, how near, how big and how colourful. Next, remember what you heard, how 
loud, from where, what pitch, how clear. Finally, remember what you felt, where, how warm or 
cold, what movement, what sensation.
Now, make the picture bigger and brighter, the sounds louder and the feelings more intense 
as you double the feeling, and double it again. Say a word to yourself that represents this 
feeling and keep on repeating it as you concentrate on the feeling.
Finally, test the ‘anchor’ by saying the word and noticing how the feeling comes back. The 
more you practice this, the better it will work for you.
It’s important that you are able to get into a resourceful state for presenting easily and quickly. Anchoring 
is an excellent technique to use for this, and it’s a good idea to build a number of anchors for yourself 
so that you can access different states easily.

Here are some ideas for anchors you can use
• A big red mental ‘On button’ (build an off button too!)
• A word
• A physical movement
• A piece of music
• An item of clothing
Posture
Different postures will convey meaning to the audience. It’s worth spending some time paying attention 
to your posture when you present and to develop a comfortably relaxed, open posture when that is 
helpful to you in your presentation.
Rhythm
Rhythm is one of the key factors in a hypnotic trance induction and is therefore a powerful aspect of 
any communication.
Delivering the presentation
State
If you ever worry or are nervous about a presentation, here are some very simple tools you can use to 
change that.
The first, and most important thing to remember is that the majority of people inadvertently make all 
kinds of everyday activities difficult, and these same people could make those same activities incredibly 
easy with just one simple, small adjustment.
Most people plan for the start of things, not the end
Public speaking, cold calling, going to the dentist and flying can be difficult, to say the least. How many 
times have you felt nervous about doing any of these? How many times have you felt nervous at the 
end? What many people experience is worry leading up to the event, nervousness at the start and relief 
at the end. Which of those three states would you like to feel, all the way through?
The processes of worry and excitement are the same, with just a tiny change in content:. Worry works 
like this:

Putting it all together
And excitement works like this:
So, here’s the simple way that you can overcome doubt, worry, anxiety, nerves or fear:
Plan for the end!
So, when you imagine the presentation, imagine it from the point where you’re saying thank you, the 
audience is nodding approvingly and you feel good about having done a great job.
Anchoring for the audience
In the first few minutes of your presentation, you can set out anchors that you will use later on.
You might want to set anchors for:
• Agreement
• Disagreement
• Reliable companies/You
• Unreliable companies/Your competitors
What else?
You can also set anchors with colours, sounds, music, gestures etc.
You can practice setting these anchors with the sequence of states you worked out earlier.
Spatial anchoring is, in my opinion, a good example of where people have jumped on a good idea and in 
doing so have reduced its effectiveness. If you have ever seen people who are ‘professional speakers’ i.e. 
they have no particularly useful skills, and they’re not famous, but they do know how to stand on a stage 
and talk about a subject, then you will probably have seen spatial anchoring in action. What you see is a 
rather deliberate and stilted wandering about on stage, where the speaker’s position is supposed to trigger 
certain states in the audience. As their presentation reaches its climax, they’re running backwards and 
forwards through the different ‘anchors’. Personally, I find this exceptionally irritating, which prevents 
it from working.

I don’t know, maybe it works beautifully and I’m just cynical. Maybe most of the people in the audience 
are thinking, “Why won’t he stand still?”. Who knows.
So do I think that this ‘technique’ has no value? Not exactly. If the audience are stuck in a certain state, 
and you can anchor that state and create a sense of movement from it then this approach can be very 
useful indeed if it is aligned with everything else about your presentation and the situation.

What I object to is the way that a techniques is hijacked by people who try to use it superficially without 
understanding why and how it works, so they spoil it for people like you who are going to trouble of 
learning about how to use NLP elegantly.
It’s what the physicist Richard Feynman called Cargo Cult Science. In one of his lectures, he said that 
South Sea islanders watched aircraft land during the war, bringing food and supplies. After the war, the 
planes stopped coming. The islanders wanted the planes to return, so they reproduced the conditions 
for that to happen. They built runways and lit fires along them. They built bamboo control towers and 
someone would sit in there with coconut shells on his head like earphones. They waited, and the planes 
didn’t come back.
This is what happens when people who don’t take the trouble to understand the underlying principles 
of NLP try to emulate the observable surface features of the techniques. They can’t get the same results, 
so they say that NLP doesn’t work. It’s like saying that airports don’t work, because when you build one, 
the planes don’t come.
When you understand how this all works, and you understand that timing and consistency are vital for 
anchoring, and you understand what a swish is and how it works, you can easily understand how to 
elicit states in the audience and how to move them from one state to another.
Getting attention
Good presenters are very good at getting and keeping the audience’s attention. Aside from anchoring, 
what other techniques can you use? One of the most important is the pattern interrupt.
There’s a simple technique you can use at the start of your presentation to reset expectations, which is 
very useful if you are presenting after your competitors, or if you want to reset the audience’s expectations 
about your subject matter.
For this, you can use a flipchart, whiteboard or even a PC projector is you prepare carefully beforehand.
The technique is a version of the Swish pattern which is something covered on the NLP Practitioner 
course.
Begin by pacing the audience’s expectations, honestly, on the flipchart, concentrating on those that are 
not useful and that you would like to change. When you have created rapport, tear off the sheet leaving 
the blank sheet underneath, screw the sheet into a ball and throw it into the corner of the room. Now 
begin writing what you want the audience’s expectations to be.

Putting it all together
Actually, there’s a step before that: tear the edges of the flipchart sheet along its perforation by about 2 
inches or 5 cm so that it tears smoothly when you pull it. If you’re using a whiteboard, make sure you 
can wipe away quickly and easily. If you’re using a PC, make sure your first slide has the audience’s real 
expectations and make the slide after either blank or with the expectations you want.
The swish with the flipchart incorporates a pattern interrupt and therefore relies very much on your 
ability to pace the audience. A pattern interrupt can be as simple as you pacing the audience’s state and 
then suddenly changing your state, or it can be as complex as the use of pyrotechnics and audio visual 
systems.
Pacing and leading
Using the state planning approach we covered earlier on, you can lead the audience through a smooth 
transition of states. The first step is to pace their current state and to then have a clear direction that you 
want to go in. Therefore, in order to pace and lead effectively, you must have a clear outcome.
Direction and misdirection
Directing the audience’s attention can be as simple as saying, “pay attention, because this is very important” 
so you direct them to remember the parts of your presentation that you want them to.
Misdirection is harder and needs more practice, because you are focussing on what you want the audience 
to not focus on. Incongruence can be a difficult thing to master but once you have, you will find many 
ways to use it effectively in your presentations and other communications.
An easy way to misdirect the audience is to use a visual aid such as a PC projection. Traditional thinking 
on presentations is that it is not a good idea to have a lot of text on slides because the audience will stop 
and read the slide before they carry on listening to you. Of course, while they are not listening, your 
words are still going in through their ears. You might be able to think of some interesting applications 
for this idea.
Questions and objections
Questions and objections are a wonderful source of feedback for you – they tell you that people are 
paying attention!
Questions demand a direct answer. Objections often provoke argument. Whilst they may be phrased 
differently, as the presenter it is not immediately obvious which is which.

Putting it all together
Unfortunately, people ask questions for lots of different reasons, only some of which require a direct 
answer, so it’s not always useful for you to answer questions. Here are some possible reasons for asking 
a question:
• To demonstrate knowledge
• To demonstrate superiority over the presenter
• To disguise an objection
• To provoke a response from the presenter
• To provoke a response from another audience member
• To demonstrate attentiveness
• To waste time
• To set up for an attack
• To hide the fact that they weren’t listening
• To gain control of the presentation
• To learn something
• To clarify a point they don’t understand
If you want to learn more about the motivation behind questions, listen to the political interviews 
conducted on BBC Radio 4’s Today program, every weekday morning (you can listen on the BBC website 
if you are outside the UK).

Putting it all together
The interviewers are masters at asking direct, attacking questions, which practiced interviewees are adept 
at deflecting, whilst sneaking indirect questions past the interviewee’s defences. In relation to NLP, they 
are very good at creating double binds, where either any answer or no answer at all will reveal the truth.
For example, in this recent (paraphrased) exchange, the journalist wanted to know if a Conservative 
politician had been part of the plot to overthrow Iain Duncan Smith.
Journalist:	 Is it important for a government to be accountable?
Politician:	 Absolutely, yes
Journalist:	 So will you be accountable for demanding his resignation?
Politician:	 That’s a private matter
The journalist’s question was a blatant set-up, and the politician’s answer is essentially, “yes I did”. This 
wasn’t a particularly elegant set-up, but it still trapped an unwary interview subject. I’ve seen many 
presenters trapped in exactly the same way.
The solution to this is very simple:
• Pause
• Repeat the question
• Check your understanding of the question
• Answer the question
You can also turn an objection into a question using the Sleight of Mouth patterns, for example:
“But isn’t this expensive”
“Are you asking for more information about the pricing structure?”
When should you take questions?
Whether you’re going to take questions throughout the presentation or at the end, you need to do these 
things:
• Allow time in your schedule – as a rule of thumb, plan your presentation to last about three-
quarters of your allocated time.

Putting it all together
• Handle questions using the format above, otherwise you will get sidetracked, which dilutes 
your message and eats up time
• Preferably have someone else manage the Q&A process for you
• Make a note of the questions so that you can incorporate your answers into the end of your 
presentation
Whether you take questions in the middle or at the end, you handle them in the same way, otherwise 
you hand control of the presentation back to the audience, and that is a very bad thing.
What many people will do is to announce that their presentation has ended when they have finished 
talking, then they invite questions.
This is how that structure looks:
Remember the structure of our presentation:
Do you see the difference? This has a number of implications, all of which are good for you:
• You hand control of the room back to the audience only when you have finished
• You dictate the pace of the questions
• You decide when there are no more questions
• You decide when the presentation ends
• You have the golden opportunity to incorporate the questions into your summary
Why is this last point so important? Well, in fact, it’s vital. Critical.
If you close the presentation and then invite questions, you are telling the audience that you failed to 
cover everything they needed. Their perception will be that they got what they needed by asking you 
questions. The presentation fizzles out when there are no more questions.

Putting it all together
If you invite questions and then close the presentation, you are telling the audience that you are flexible 
and authoritative, and that you are adapting to their needs. Their perception will be that the presentation 
was interactive and that it gave them everything they needed. The presentation ends cleanly when you 
close it.
Compare it to a film. Does a film end, or does it just fizzle out when the characters have nothing left to say?
When you have a number of people presenting and you have a panel Q&A session at the end, the 
approach is a little different.
In this situation, one person will have the role of managing the questions. Here’s what they do:
1.	 Invite questions from the audience
2.	 Select someone to ask a question
3.	 Repeat the question so that the whole audience can hear it, and clarifies it if necessary
4.	 Asks which speaker will respond, or selects one if the choice is clear
5.	 Checks that the answer is satisfactory
6.	 Moves to the next question or closes the Q&A

Putting it all together
You can see how steps 3 and 4 are partly designed to give the speaker time to think of a good answer! 
When you’re presenting by yourself, pausing and clarifying also gives you valuable time to think.
Feedback
How do you know you are on the right track? What signs do you pay attention to that let you know if 
your presentation is having the right effect on the audience, or if there is anything you need to change?
Could you suggest a feedback mechanism to the audience at the start of your presentation? Could you 
even build in an unconscious feedback mechanism?
How can you manage the audience’s state in order to control feedback or interactivity?
One thing I’ve seen people do at the end of a presentation is ask for feedback. Think back to outcomes 
and you’ll realise that this is very dangerous. If the audience didn’t know you were going to ask for 
feedback then what they give you will be random and reactive at best. This is one reason why the feedback 
forms they give out at the end of training courses are so useless. The audience are paying attention for 
the purpose of learning something, not for the purpose of evaluating the training. Completely different!
If you are going to ask for feedback, make sure you say so at the start so that the audience know to pay 
attention and you consequently get the kind of feedback that is useful to you.
Closing
It’s very important that you give yourself time to close the presentation properly. Here are some points 
to bear in mind:
• Remind the audience of the purpose of your presentation
• Remind the audience of the key points
• Remind the audience of the questions that you answered
• Ask the audience to do whatever it is you want them to do
• Tell the audience what they need to do right now
• Make sure the audience knows how to get in touch with you
• And always remember to say thank you!
It’s a good idea to future pace at the end of your presentation, and summarising the presentation itself is 
the ideal foundation because you create a momentum by starting in the past and then moving forwards 
in time.
By summarising what you have already covered in your presentation, the audience will shift into an 
agreement state that makes it easier for them to agree with your suggestions for future plans or next steps.

Putting it all together
For example, “So you’ve heard all about presenting, and I’ve told you about some of the applications of 
NLP in presenting, and as you have read through this, you may have thought of some questions, and as 
this chapter begins to draw to a close you might think of more ways to put this into practice, tomorrow, 
next week, next month and as you use more and more of these techniques with every presentation you 
deliver, you can find yourself becoming more and more effective and elegant with each new experience”.
Your identity as a presenter
The logical levels idea is an excellent integration tool because it helps you to create greater alignment 
between your identity (how you think of yourself), your behaviour and your environment. Traditional 
training, which only gets people to demonstrate their behaviour without creating behavioural alignment, 
creates presenters who say, “Well, I can present when I have to but it’s not really me doing it, it’s an act”, 
just like sales people say, “I do sell, but I’m not a salesman”.
An exercise like this gets the person to create a new identity which encompasses and embraces their 
new abilities and provides the foundation for creating new behaviour in new situations. By integrating 
skills in this way, the person will automatically become a more flexible, more effective presenter, even 
in situations you have never covered during the training course.
Set out 5 spaces on the floor to represent 5 logical levels. You can mark them with pieces of paper if 
you like.
Step onto Environment. What is the environment for you as a presenter? The location, the audience, 
other factors.
Step onto Behaviour. What do you see yourself doing as a great presenter?
Step onto Capabilities. What skills have you developed?
Step onto Beliefs. What is now true for you as a presenter? What do you believe about yourself? 
What do you believe about your audiences?
Step onto Identity. What kind of presenter have you become?
Walk back though each level, taking with you what you have learned about yourself at each level.
Timeline
Where a logical levels exercise integrates through a person’s mental hierarchy, a timeline creates instant 
experience and convinces the presenter that their new skills will continue to develop and grow over time.
A timeline is especially important for people who were nervous of presenting. A common concern is, “I 
feel good now, but I know that as soon as I go back to work and have to present for real, I’ll be nervous 
again”. By now, you’ll recognise this as a worry program, where the person imagines something will 
happen in the future and then makes it happen through their state and behaviour.

145 
Putting it all together
Using a timeline is a more physical means of future pacing, so you can lead the presenter as far into the 
future as is necessary for them to really believe that they are a confident, comfortable presenter.
Imagine looking into the future and seeing a number of presentations that lie ahead of you, becoming 
more ambitious and important as time goes on. Take a step into that future, stepping into the next 
presentation you’ll be doing. Be aware of the sense of satisfaction at presenting with impact, and see some 
of the new behaviours you exhibit. Take another step into the next presentation and see how you have 
developed again, noticing how that feels.
Continue to step forward through future presentations, being aware of how you grow and develop with 
each one. When you have arrived at a point in the future that you are comfortable with, stop and ask 
yourself, “what kind of presenter have I become?”
Now, turn and look back and see how much you have developed since you began. Walk back to the 
present moment, taking with you the new experiences and resources. When you arrive back at the present, 
turn and face the future once more. Imagine the future looking bigger and brighter now and being much 
closer than you had imagined. Take a moment to enjoy the future that awaits you.
Bringing your ideas to life
As I said at the start of this chapter, I think that the ability to present is probably the most important 
professional skill that you can master. Regardless of how good your ideas are, if you cannot communicate 
them to a large number of people in an inspiring and compelling way, they will never reach their full 
potential.
Every year, the number of new patents registered increases and yet this still represents the tip of the 
iceberg. As many as 99% of new ideas just gather dust and never become reality. People will infer the 
importance of your idea, not from the content but from the way you communicate it.
I find that successful executives very quickly learn a survival mechanism which protects them from the 
overwhelming demands on their time – they say no to everything. They do not have the knowledge or 
experience necessary to evaluate every idea on its own merits, so they learn to judge the importance of 
an idea from the persistence and passion of the person presenting the idea.
Whether you are creating global businesses or inspiring children, the art of public speaking will always 
be key to the way we relate to each other as a species. After putting into practice the ideas in this chapter, 
you will have a much better chance of making your ideas, beliefs and desires a reality.

In a nutshell
22	 In a nutshell
NLP is about your brain, language and your senses. Everything that is in your brain got there through 
your senses and is represented by your senses as an incomplete representation of the real world. You 
brain makes up for its inability to process all of the available sensory data by comparing what is really 
happening with what it expects to happen and then improvising to hide any differences. In order to 
make sensory data match with your memory of the world, your brain ignores, corrupts and simplifies 
sensory data.
If your senses are your brain’s input then language is one of your brain’s outputs. You were able to 
communicate very effectively with anyone who took notice of you, long before you learned to speak. The 
fact that you are alive today proves that you were able to get your own way without the need to learn a 
spoken language. Strangely, we are brought up to value spoken or written language above other forms 
of communication, so we are taught to logically exclude or ignore non-verbal language. Our brains, 
however, have evolved to use non-verbal communication to carry the majority of communication traffic 
to and from other people. Therefore, we must be aware of this and pay as much attention to non-verbal 
language as we do to verbal language. Of course, you don’t have to actively pay attention to it – you just 
have to be aware that it’s there and that it’s feeding your sense of intuition. Learn to trust it.
In other words, spend at least an equal amount of time preparing what you are going to say as how you 
are going to say it. If you are unprepared, unsure or even doubtful about what you are presenting, your 
non-verbal communication will reveal your true thoughts to your audience. Some will ignore this, some 
will dismiss it as intuition and some will attend to it as the primary message – totally ignoring your 
carefully prepared words.
In order for you to be at your best as a professional communicator, it helps for you to have a variety of 
ways to manage your own state. You can use a combination of physiology and anchoring to make sure 
that you maintain your peak state at all times – whatever that may be.
NLP has some really effective and unique communication tools that can help you in any situation, 
from informing all the way through to influencing. These communication tools tap into natural mental 
processes and can generate curiosity, motivation and the enthusiasm to go out and take action, right away.
NLP isn’t something that you “do” or that you add to your existing skills. It certainly contains some tools 
and methods which people recognise as being part of NLP, but in itself it doesn’t really exist. NLP is just 
a means to refine what you already do, it isn’t something that is separate to your existing skills. Think 
of NLP as a performance tune up rather than a shiny new tool kit.

In a nutshell
Many people who go through the NLP Practitioner training spend some time “doing” NLP to all their 
friends and colleagues, which can give NLP a bad name. After they’ve had time to integrate their new 
skills, most return to their original state with some new enhancements. They’re the same person they were 
before, but they seem to be better at getting what they want from life. NLP is definitely a skill set that 
can and must integrate with your natural personality, otherwise you will spend so much time thinking 
about doing it that you’ll never get round to doing it.
If you read through this book carefully, you’ll find it threaded through with NLP in practice – and to 
read it means that you too are practising while learning. If you come to a Practitioner course, you’ll get 
the opportunity to practice with other people and refine your skills even further.
There are a number of books around that aim to teach NLP skills to trainers, but they seem to be aimed 
at telling you everything there is to know about NLP and not so much about what to do with it. One 
of the most popular ones is simply a rehashed introduction to NLP with a few examples of training 
applications thrown in.
This book is different in that it practices while preaching, and it’s written with the aim of helping you 
become a more effective trainer, using NLP as an enabler. You know that NLP is only one approach and 
there are many more that are equally valid. Therefore my aim isn’t to teach you NLP – if that’s what you 
want, go to a Practitioner course. My aim here has been to help you apply NLP in your work, become 
more effective and perhaps even choose to learn more about it in the future.
If you’re the sort of person who is naturally curious, never stops learning and if you have a passion for 
self improvement, then NLP is a set of tools that can really benefit you.
As you begin to notice more and practice more, you might find yourself dipping back into this handbook 
for a reminder. As you do, you might notice how the principles and concepts of NLP are woven through 
it. You can take this as a sign that the principles are also becoming woven through you, helping you to 
become the teacher, trainer, presenter, coach, facilitator or learning enabler that you have always had 
the potential to be.

Here’s some additional information that didn’t really fit into the book.
You can use the training exercises freely, although if you publish them yourself e.g. in training notes, I 
would appreciate a mention. More importantly, I would love to hear how you’ve used them and what 
results you have had.
Whilst this isn’t strictly a book about NLP in itself, I thought a little background information on NLP 
and NLP training would be useful.

Training Exercises
24	 Training Exercises
Here are some ready-made exercises that you can use to demonstrate particular learning points. Some 
of them are designed to help people learn how to learn, which is a very useful thing to do.
The most important thing to remember about these exercises is that they get the audience doing something. 
It doesn’t matter what your training course is about, you must get the audience out of their chairs and 
moving. Physiology is such a major factor in mental and emotional state, so if you let people sit still for 
long, their brains will grind to a halt. You may be training computing skills or time management, and 
you may think that some topics lend themselves well to delegate activity and some don’t. As a trainer or 
teacher, if you’re doing more than 50% of the work, you’re making life hard for yourself.
You could have people come up with acronyms or mnemonics for existing factual information, or you 
could create a “learning wall” where people post sticky notes with new ideas that they’ve had whilst 
learning. What’s important is that the process is creative, and the learners have to physically move to 
complete it.
Some people can only learn by doing. Simply watching and listening is insufficient. I hope you enjoy 
these suggestions and build on them with your own ideas and experiences.

Training Exercises
Open for business
This isn’t an exercise as such, but it is a useful hint for getting people focussed at the start of a training 
course. If you are training within a company you will often find that there are implicit behavioural rules 
about training courses. For example, break times are flexible, it’s OK to leave mobile phones switched on 
and emails are more important than getting back to the training room on time. If you find these rules 
distracting, you can bypass them for the duration of the course and set your own rules. To do this, you 
use a combination of anchoring and pacing in order to gain rapport.
First, pick a spot in the room that you will not stand in again. Now go and stand in that spot. Tell the 
audience that you want to make sure you understand the way courses have been run before, whilst 
pointing to the past. This will usually be behind the audience or over to their left, so it’s up to you to 
decide how subtle you can be.
Ask the audience about each rule that you want to ‘suspend’. Often, when you raise a rule such as mobile 
phones or break times, an argument will break out. Let it run its course as rules imposed by the audience 
have a power of their own.
As you repeat each rule back to the audience, point down to the floor to anchor that rule to your current 
location.
When you have extracted all the rules you want to suspend, and the audience are firmly embedded in 
their memories, walk away from the spot and, pointing back at it, say something like “OK, so that’s how 
training courses have been run here in the past”. Moving towards the spot where you’ll be for the rest 
of the day, say “So that we can get the maximum value from this shared experience, we’re going to do 
a few things differently. After the course, you can have your old rules back, if you think you still need 
them.” Now, you can list any changes you want to make to the “rules”.
A good way to deal with the problem of mobile phones, emails and missing delegates is to say “I know 
that you are all busy and that you have many demands on your time. I also know that you are here right 
now because at this moment, this is the most important place for you to be. When we take a break I will 
tell you the time that I will restart. If you’re not back in time I will presume that at that moment, you 
have something more important that you need to do. I’m happy with that, because I want to make sure 
that when you’re in the room you can be 100% focussed and when you’re out of the room it’s because 
you have to do something that is more important for you.”
So, you’re pacing their current experience and expectations and then leading them in a new direction 
with suggestions and anchoring. Outside of the training room they can think about work and other 
‘normal’ things, but when they’re inside training room it’s time to focus and learn.

Training Exercises
The majority of delegates will agree that time is valuable and it’s important to get the most out of the 
learning opportunity, and group influence will do the rest for you.
Learning to learn
Group size:
1
Time:
20 minutes + 10 minute debrief
Materials:
Juggling balls, one set per person or A4 paper, 
three pieces per person
As the Sphinx said in the film Mystery Men, “Before you can learn my teachings, I must first teach you 
how to learn”. I recommend you watch this film as an exercise in running mystical training events.
We all take it for granted that we learn, and we often assume that everyone learns the same way. Most 
of the training rooms I have ever seen seem to be designed on the basis that we learn best when we sit 
at a desk for hours on end, in a darkened room, facing a bright light source where we are shown strange 
images, accompanied by the hypnotic droning of the presenter. This may explain why some presenters 
say, “if you only take one thing away from today then I’ve done a good job”. In an environment like this, 
transferring just one idea into each delegate’s brain is an outstanding feat.
If you have juggling balls, give one set to each person and set them the task of learning how to juggle 
in 20 minutes.
If you don’t have juggling balls, give each person three pieces of paper and have them start by making 
their own juggling balls.
Finally, stand back and watch. You will notice a number of interesting things happening. Firstly, there 
will be some negotiation to establish who in the room already has the necessary skills. Some people will 
go to a quiet corner, others will form groups. Some people will start coaching others, offering advice or 
feedback. Some will tell others how to do it, others will ask how to do it. Some people will try to tackle 
the whole task, some will break it down into chunks. Some will start juggling one ball, others will go 
for all three.
In this simple exercise, you will see patterns emerge for leadership, coaching and learning styles. What’s 
more important is that everyone gets up and moves about in order to learn. Movement is a key part of 
learning.
Another key learning point is to notice what happens when people drop the juggling balls. Do they stop? 
Do they give up in despair? Do they even notice or draw attention to it? Does this mean that making 
mistakes is just a sign that learning is taking place?

Please don’t run this exercise and then have the audience sit down at a desk for the rest of the day. Use 
what you have learned and incorporate it into the whole experience.
Competitive learning
Group size:
1
Time:
20 minutes + 10 minute debrief
Materials:
A4 paper, one piece per person
Some people say they learn best when under pressure or against deadlines. Certainly, we can learn 
important lessons at a time of heightened stress but we rarely learn complex tasks or retain information 
effectively.
Give each person a piece of paper and have them make a paper aeroplane. At the end of the 20 minutes, 
there will be a competition. The winner gets a prize and the loser pays a penalty. If you wish, and if you 
have enough paper, you can allow people to test as many designs as they like but they may enter only 
one for the competition.
Again, just stand back and watch.

At the end of the time, hold the competition and award points for each aeroplane.
If you are feeling brave, you can add an extra layer to the exercise at this stage. For some people, you 
decide the points and make them arbitrarily high or low. For other people, let the audience choose the 
points awarded. You may choose to give away real prizes but I recommend that you give the winner 
the prize of one minute imagining the holiday of their dreams and the loser the penalty of one minute 
imagining the booby prize of their dreams.
You will have noticed some interesting things happening in this exercise that didn’t happen during the 
juggling exercise. Firstly, the threat of competition reduces the amount of collaboration. Secondly, the 
threat of a prize or penalty will focus attention in one direction or the other. Ask each delegate whether 
they were motivated to win the prize or avoid the penalty.
How does the concept of “winning” affect the way that people deal with “failure”, compared to in the 
juggling exercise?
During the judging stage, you will see different patterns of behaviour too, depending on whether you or 
the audience awarded the points. People seem to take ownership and responsibility for decisions they 
have been involved in, and you will learn about the influence hierarchies of the group.
You can ask people during the debrief whether they were thinking about the prize or the penalty and 
the answers will reveal interesting information about the way that people are motivated – some towards 
desires and some away from threats.
Of course, you’ll notice lots of other things too. Again, it’s important that you incorporate what you 
notice into the whole experience. Some people think that prizes and competitions are motivating. Now 
that you have tried both ways, you can decide for yourself before having a “fun quiz” at the end of the 
training course.
You’ll notice that it doesn’t matter who “wins”.

Training Exercises
In pairs, delegates will conduct a simple negotiation, e.g. what TV channel to watch, where to go for 
a holiday or what to have for dinner. The key to this exercise is to have the delegates adopt beliefs and 
behaviours which are not their own, as they limit their own negotiating ability to ruling out certain 
approaches and behaviours which are quite acceptable for other people.
Create a number of characters and write them onto the cards, giving a card to each delegate so that their 
partner does not see what is on the card. This is to stop them deciding what is the “right answer” for 
this exercise. Suggested characters include:
A teenager
A five year old child
A newborn baby
A pensioner
A politician
Someone you know who is very manipulative
Someone you know who always seems to get their own way
The most inspiring leader you know
The most diplomatic person you know
The most important person you know
The purpose of this exercise isn’t to “win” but to have delegates try on behaviours that they would never 
normally use or have access to.
During the debrief, you can ask delegates what tactics they normally employ to get compliance from 
someone, and the answers will include “ask nicely”, “bargain”, “trade a favour” etc. Then ask them what 
a five year old child would do and the answers will include “cry”, “smile”, “sulk” etc. Now, do you know 
any adults who do any of those things? Of course you do! So, these behaviours can’t be ruled out because 
they work, in the right context. Ruling out choices just limits your ability to achieve your goals.

Whether this implies that the ends justify the means may be an interesting, if lengthy, discussion topic. 
By this time, they have already used tactics that they “would never use”, so it’s really too late!
Mediation
Group size:

Time:
30 minutes + 10 minute debrief
Materials:
Record cards, sticky notes or a few pieces 
of A4 paper which you’ll tear into small

This exercise is exactly the same as the previous one except the negotiation group now comprises three 
people – two negotiating parties and a mediator. The job of the mediator is to find a level at which 
both parties are satisfied. Compromise is not permitted, both parties must have their original or better 
criteria satisfied.
Rotate so that each person has a turn as mediator, taking 10 minutes per turn.

This exercise gets people thinking about values. If you wish, you can introduce people to the idea of 
logical levels first, but they already know it – intuitively. This is a good coaching exercise because it 
trains people to avoid compromise. In a compromise, neither party is satisfied because each has to settle 
for less than they want in order to reach an agreement. Did anyone in the audience notice that, with a 
mediator in place, there was no longer a requirement on them to reach an agreement so they could be 
as demanding as they liked?
A coaching approach to this exercise would be for the mediator to ask each person “what’s important 
about what you want, what will it give you, what will it do for you” until a common value is reached. 
Then, the mediator would move back down, finding examples of activities that satisfied the common 
value for both parties. For example, the negotiation may be about which TV channel to watch but the 
outcome may be to go to the cinema instead.
Of course, that’s just a good coaching approach. There will be many other approaches which are equally 
effective. Your job is to draw them out, model them, notice and draw attention to the important lessons 
and incorporate them into the whole experience.
That’s right
Group size:
2 to 20ish
Time:
1 minute per person + 10 minute debrief
Materials:
None
Each delegate takes it in turn to stand up in front of the group and speak on any subject at all. The 
remaining members of the group try as hard as they can to constantly interrupt the speaker with 
irrelevant questions and comments. The speaker’s job is to acknowledge each interruption and move on. 
The speaker must not engage in a conversation with any interrupter. The speaker’s must acknowledge 
the values of the interrupter but not the interruption. This exercise trains delegates to separate people 
from their behaviour.
During the debrief, it’s interesting to discuss some of the strategies people use to keep themselves on 
track. I find that the people who are most successful in this exercise are those who use an incongruence 
technique – they use polite, warm and thankful language and voice tone whilst saying “shut up” with 
their gestures and body posture.

One person volunteers to give a short presentation lasting only 20 seconds on any subject. Each of the 
remaining delegates writes down the first 5 things that they notice. It’s best if they can write down as 
they are watching, but you will probably need to give them a minute or two afterwards to catch up.
When debriefing, ask what kind of things people noticed and you’ll find that some people notice what 
they can see – clothing, hand movements, movement etc. Some people notice what they can hear – 
voice tone, pauses, coughs, accent etc. Very few people will comment on the subject matter unless it is 
something remarkable or contentious such as football!
If you keep a record of what people notice, you’ll see an interesting pattern emerge. Just over half of the 
items will be visual, about a third will be auditory and the remainder will be specific to the content. I 
think that’s a strong correlation with Mehrabian and Argyle’s findings on communication channels, so 
it seems we don’t just transmit on those channels, we receive on them too.
Mehrabian and Argyle’s findings were:
• Visual 55%
• Auditory non-verbal (voice pitch, tone, volume, inflection) 38%
• Auditory verbal (words) 7%
To draw a pie chart based on your own results, just count up what the audience recorded in the each 
of the three categories. Ask each of them just to give you the total of what they saw, what they heard in 
tone and what words they heard. Make a note of any specific words as you will often find a connection 
or common relevance which is also interesting.

Cheat
Group size:
3 to 6 per pack of cards
Time:
30 minutes + 10 minute debrief
Materials:
Packs of ordinary playing cards
In this exercise, groups play the card game called Cheat. The pack is shuffled and dealt equally between 
players and the winner is the player who gets rid of his cards first. Each player, takes it in turn to lay down 
cards in groups of the same value, such as “three Kings” or “two sevens”. The next player can only lay down 
cards that have the same value or plus or minus one, so if the first player lays down “two sevens” the next 
player must play sixes, sevens or eights. The cards are placed on a pile in the middle of the table, face down. 
What happens if a player does not have any cards of the right value? I refer you to the name of the game.
A player can cheat at any time and usually this is detected by the other players counting cards, guessing 
and reading sensory cues such as giggling or fidgeting. In this exercise, the players must use only sensory 
cues to determine cheating. The bigger group and the more packs of cards you play with, the better.

Any player can call “Cheat!” at any time and the person who last laid down cards must show the cards 
they laid on the pile. If the call of Cheat is correct i.e. the cards are not what they were said to be, the 
‘cheater’ picks up the entire pile. If the call of Cheat is incorrect i.e. the cards are as called, the ‘caller’ 
picks up the entire pile. Play then resumes from the player who was correct.
Since the players are relying on sensory information, they are forced to calibrate their senses and will 
come up with interesting strategies for detecting cheating. The more sneaky players will also develop 
strategies to avoid detection and even strategies to deceive the other players. During the debrief, it is 
interesting to compare these strategies to the ways that the players move through their working lives.
Cheat is a game that may not have a winner because the person with the most cards is always the best 
placed to identify Cheaters, so only the most skilful players will be able to cheat consistently enough to 
lose all their cards. This is another reason for having more players and more combined packs of cards. 
You may need to call time on the game before an outright winner is identified.
Rapport and eye contact
Group size:
2
Time:
10 minutes + 10 minute debrief
Materials:
None
In pairs, person A sits comfortably and talks about a subject of interest to them. Person B matches their 
body posture as much as they can within physical constraints. It doesn’t matter whether they copy exactly 
or adopt a mirror image posture. Person B gives plenty of non-verbal encouragement, nodding, smiling 
etc. When person A is in “full flow”, person B changes posture and breaks eye contact.
A and B then swap roles and repeat. At the end, get everyone to make eye contact and smile.
As a facilitator, the hardest part for you is getting people to break eye contact – their eyes will be 
irresistibly drawn together.
During the debrief, pay attention to the feelings of discomfort experienced by both A and B at the point 
that eye contact was broken.
Practice at breaking eye contact is very useful, especially as a means of controlling the flow of a 
conversation or quietening a noisy delegate!

Rapport and voice tone
Group size:
2
Time:
10 minutes + 10 minute debrief
Materials:
None
In pairs, person A says a very short phrase, no more than a couple of words, and person B repeats it 
back, matching pace, rhythm, tone, pitch, volume and inflection. Person A listens carefully and coaches 
person B to match the voice tone more accurately. They continue until person B gets it exactly right or 
close enough, then swap.
A and B then swap roles and repeat. Continue for a few turns and then debrief.
During the debrief, pay attention to any feelings the delegates experienced at the point that person B 
got the phrase exactly right.
Raising expectations
Group size:
Any
Time:
2 minutes
Materials:
None
A really quick exercise to make your delegates say “wow!” by demonstrating how they can achieve more 
than they think if they put their minds to it.
Everyone stands up in enough floor space to swing their arms freely. You ask them to point directly out in 
front of themselves, then turn as far as they can whilst keeping their feet still. When they have stretched 
round as far as they can go, they look down their arms and make a note of what they’re pointing at. 
Finally, they turn to the front and put their arms down.
Next, they close their eyes and imagine that they are raising their arms and turning again. This time, 
they’re just going to imagine turning and turning so easily that they feel they’re made of rubber. They go 
past the point they stopped at before, way past it – maybe two or three or four feet. Now they notice what 
they’re pointing at and then return their imaginary arms to their sides, they can open their eyes again.
Finally, they do the exercise one more time for real, to see how much further round they can turn. Just 
wait for the gasps of amazement!

Go team
Once, there was a successful businessman who had a hobby that he was very passionate about. In his 
spare time, he loved motor racing. At first, he used to go along to as many races as he could and watch 
but as he became more successful, he could afford to take part. He was a very talented driver and quickly 
built himself a reputation as a serious competitor.
One day, he decided he would take the plunge and dedicate himself to his dream – to build his own 
racing team. He set aside some money of his own, gained commitment from sponsors and started to 
recruit his team.
At first, the recruitment didn’t go very well. He couldn’t afford to pay the same salaries as the top teams 
paid, so he was looking for talented but unknown drivers. He recruited some, but they didn’t stay in 
the team long before they moved on. Like any manager, he knew that he needed to have a team that 
worked well together.

The other problem that he had was that he was himself a very accomplished driver. When he recruited 
a new driver he would try to teach them to drive better. Unfortunately, he didn’t really know how he 
could drive so well as it was mostly intuitive. He would get angry with the drivers when they couldn’t 
see for themselves how he was able to drive. He was on the brink of closing the team down, believing 
that the problem was one of recruitment.
He was watching a sports program on TV one day when he noticed something odd. When the interviewer 
was talking to a football manager, the manager kept referring to someone called a ‘coach’. The same thing 
happened with some other sports too. He wondered what a coach could do that a manager couldn’t. By 
chance, he then met someone who was a team coach, so he invited him down to the race track to see 
what would happen.
The coach watched the drivers practice, and he watched the team manager trying to tell the drivers how 
to drive. The drivers lacked confidence in their own talents and when they asked how the manager knew 
certain things, he said “it just feels right”, or “you can tell by the way it sounds”.
There were three drivers in the team, so the coach watched each one very carefully, and he also watched 
the manager very carefully. The first driver, Adam, was very good at accelerating. From the starting line, 
Adam was at least a car’s length in front of anyone else at the first corner. He seemed to have an intuitive 
sense of when to change gear to maximise the car’s performance. The second driver, Brian, could brake 
later than anyone else and so was much faster into the corners than any of the other drivers. He seemed 
to have an intuitive sense of knowing when to brake as he approached a bend. The third driver, Claire, 
could take corners faster than any of the other drivers on the circuit. She seemed to have an intuitive 
sense of the car’s cornering ability and grip.
The downside of these talents was that Adam was always the first into the first corner, but the last out. 
Brian caught up with Adam at the bend but slowed down too much and was overtaken. Claire would 
overtake on the bend but lose her advantage on the straight.
The coach got the whole team together and pointed out to them their strengths. The drivers began to 
feel much better about this. Each driver, at a certain point on the track, was by far the fastest driver on 
the circuit but was let down by average performance in other areas. The coach began to ask some very 
special questions about how the drivers knew what they knew.
It turned out that Adam was listening for a certain tone from the engine, tyres and gearbox. He could 
hear when the car was at peak power output and he could change gear at the exact moment to take 
advantage. Consequently, he accelerated much faster than drivers who only changed gear at the ‘red 
line’ by watching the rev counter. With some help from the coach, he was able to teach the other drivers 
what to listen for.

Brian could brake much later because he was looking somewhere different to the other drivers. The other 
drivers were looking at the apex of the bend, whereas Brian was looking beyond the bend. He was able 
to judge the distance to the apex much more accurately, enabling him to brake late but still drive safely. 
With some help from the coach, he could easily teach the other drivers where to look.
Claire could actually feel the car’s sideways motion. She could very accurately feel the movement of the 
suspension as the car leaned into the bend and she could feel how the motion changed as the tyres started 
to lose grip. She could actually feel the acceleration at different points in her body. With some help from 
the coach, she was able to teach the other drivers how to feel the movement of the car.
The team went from strength to strength, not because they were taught something new, but because they 
were able to share their talents and exploit them for the benefit of the whole team. Each driver still had 
their unique talent, they just helped each other achieve above average results across the range of skills 
needed to be successful. The coach didn’t need to be an expert in driving, only an expert in learning.
What about the manager? Well, the coach had a special job for him. He had to go to every newspaper, 
sports journalist, sponsor, TV station and racing promoter and tell them that he had a new team. He 
had to tell them that this was the best team on the planet and they were going to re-write the motor 
racing rules. He had to prove to everyone that he believed in them. And so, the new team was reborn.
Working holidays
There was once a salesman for a company that made special metal alloys for weapons. He had travelled 
the world, selling his company’s products to every developed nation. He loved his job and he couldn’t 
help doing it, even on holiday. One year, he took his holiday in the Amazon Rainforest (it could happen!) 
and he came across a tribe of Indians who were hunters. He asked them what they used for their arrow 
tips and they said “We hunt a wild cat that lives in the forest. We use its fur for clothing, its meat for 
food and it’s teeth for arrow tips. They are very sharp and easily penetrate the skin of small animals.” 
The salesman asked how many teeth could be used from each cat and they said “Four”. Then he asked 
how accurate their hunters’ archery skills were. They said “Every child serves a ten year apprenticeship to 
become a master archer. If they cannot shoot arrows straight, they run out of cat’s teeth and the village 
people have no meat”.
So the salesman immediately recognised a great opportunity, and he also realised that he needed to keep 
his best product until last so that he could build up his sale. He asked the leader of the village “If I could 
show you a way to hunt more cats, and bigger animals, with a limitless supply of arrow tips and reduce 
your apprenticeship for archers to just one year, would you be interested?” The wise, yet strangely gullible 
village leader said “Of course, can you do a presentation to my board tomorrow?”

So, the salesman showed the villagers arrow tips made from steel. They were heavier than cat’s teeth but 
harder and sharper. They could buy a limitless supply of arrow tips (because they happened to have a 
gold mine in their village that they didn’t understand the value of) so the hunters didn’t have to be so 
accurate. With just some basic training in how to use a bow and arrow, anyone could hunt a cat. The 
villagers rejoiced.
After a few days, the salesman returned and showed the villagers his titanium alloy arrow tips. They were 
as sharp as steel yet as light as a cat’s tooth. Now that everyone in the village was a hunter, he had more 
users to demonstrate the product to. Sure enough, the arrow flew further than the steel tipped arrow. 
To the salesman’s surprise, the villagers said “yeah, very nice, but we’re happy with our steel arrows”. The 
salesman said “But you’ll use fewer arrows because these will fly further” and the villagers said “So?”
The next day the salesman returned with tungsten carbide tipped arrows, and had the same reaction 
as the day before. He was very confused – normally his customers would be getting more and more 
excited. He decided to go back to the village and show them his best product. “Look”, he said, “I have 
here arrow tips made with tungsten carbide tips, titanium alloy bodies and with a depleted Uranium 
filling.” He fired one at a tree and it went straight through, like a hot knife through butter. The villagers 
said “Impressive, but we don’t eat trees”. Now the salesman was really upset. Couldn’t these people see 
the applications of his marvellous arrow tips? Perhaps they were too stupid too understand. His wife 
had warned him about this when he left her by the poolside in Rio.
The wise village leader said “Your arrow tips are indeed marvellous, but remember we are a simple people 
with simple needs. Your steel arrow tips already represent a step change in technology for us, enabling 
greater exploitation of our natural habitat without disturbing our learning based culture.” It turned out 
that a management consultant had been on holiday there just the week before. “Your top of the range 
arrow tips are too advanced for us. We have neither the skills nor needs to exploit their full potential, 
therefore we only require something that is one level better than what we have today. Besides, I’m going 
on a dream quest this afternoon and I’ll be off my head on psycho-active mushrooms for a few days, so 
I can’t make a decision until next week”.
The salesman learned a very important lesson on that holiday – that he shouldn’t leave his wife alone in 
Rio with only a book for company, but that’s another story. Do you know what else he learned?

What is NLP?
26	 What is NLP?
What is NLP? It’s a mindset, an attitude that has created a wide range of techniques that are used in 
business, coaching, personal change and therapy to solve problems, create changes and help people like 
you to tap into the vast unconscious resources that lie within you.
In training, NLP is not something that you learn about – it’s something that you experience for yourself 
so that you can learn what works best for you. Some of the exercises will have a huge impact on you, 
whilst others will seem to have no effect at all. There is no right way to try the exercises, and there is 
no right answer. What is more important than anything else is that you pay close attention to what 
happens – whatever happens – and that you are able to learn something from that experience.
NLP is concerned only with what works. The only way you will find out what works for you is to do 
something and then notice what happens. Just getting into this simple habit will put you way ahead of 
most of the population. Many people will say “I don’t think that would work” instead of trying it. Many 
more people go through life not noticing what works for them and what doesn’t. By practising these 
skills so that they become habits, you will get better results than most other people.

NLP – Skills for Learning

What is NLP?
NLP isn’t something that you learn how to do, it’s more a process of refining what you already do so that 
you get better, more consistent results. By enjoying the learning process, you will find yourself achieving 
more ambitious goals easily and getting more from life.
NLP is a tool kit for modelling outstanding performance that has been used to create practical tool kits 
that help you get better, more consistent results in your career and personal life. You can use it to develop 
your communication skills, relationships, achieve goals and solve many different types of personal and 
professional problems.
NLP is relevant to you because it allows you to access the skills and resources you already have in a way 
that makes it easier for you to get consistent results. NLP is not about you learning a whole different 
way of operating – if anything, it’s a way for you to concentrate more easily on what already works for 
you. Of course, NLP does contain a lot of tools and techniques that you can pick up and use, I’m just 
guessing that you already use many of them without knowing it.
NLP is not new – it’s not a complicated system dreamt up by someone in a dark cave somewhere, 
it’s simply a method of modelling and replicating unconscious, behavioural skills. Over the past 30 
years or so, excellent performers in many areas have been modelled to produce techniques. Therapists 
were originally modelled for their ability to help other people change. Since then, athletes have been 
modelled for their ability to motivate themselves and reach peak performance states. Sales people have 
been modelled for their ability to build great relationships and influence the outcome of negotiations. 
Actors have been modelled for their ability to access states – I heard that Mike Myers uses it to access 
the different characters he plays in the Austin Powers films. I spend a lot of time working with teams in 
companies, modelling the high performers and transferring that model to everyone else in the team, so 
that everyone can get the same results.
You might be wondering what “NLP” stands for – Neuro Linguistic Programming, which simply means 
that it’s the study of the relationship between your brain, your language and your behaviour. It also implies 
that any unconscious behaviour – something that you can do without having to think about it – is a series 
of simple programs that can be run without conscious intervention. Driving a car is a good example of 
a series of programs – changing gear, knowing where to steer etc. – that you mostly control consciously. 
If you have ever ‘missed’ part of a journey or had a conversation with someone whilst driving, you’ll 
have an experience of unconscious behaviour.
In the 1960s, Richard Bandler, a mathematician, and John Grinder, a linguist wanted to find out if 
there was a way of modelling and coding the healing language used by certain exceptional therapists 
like Milton H Erickson and Virginia Satir who seemed to have a magical effect on people who came to 
them for help – ‘healing’ them with just a few words compared to years of repetitive ‘traditional’ therapy.

What is NLP?
Bandler and Grinder did indeed produce such a model and they uncovered some aspects of our use of 
language which are powerful and surprising. You can read about the original modelling in books such 
as “Structure of Magic”.
They noticed that people such as Erickson and Satir naturally used language to change beliefs and 
behaviour. Satir asked questions which changed the way people thought. She challenged people’s internal 
beliefs and brought them to the surface where they could be dealt with. When a wife would say, “my 
husband always comes home late – he doesn’t love me”, Virginia Satir would ask “how do you know 
that coming home late means not loving you?”. This sounds so simple, yet it’s very different from other 
approaches because it’s directed at the world inside someone’s mind rather than the “facts” of the matter. 
Other therapists might have worked on the husband’s timekeeping or given the wife a hobby or social 
life. Virginia made people think differently about their values and beliefs. The wife could feel loved, 
whatever time her husband came home. That alone changed the balance of their relationship and gave 
them new choices.
One of Erickson’s natural patterns was the use of presuppositions – beliefs we hold true in order for 
something else to make sense. For example if I say, “how is John?” then I presuppose that John exists 
and that you know who and how he is. Often, questions in interviews and tests presuppose a certain 
response, or range of responses. For example, when did you last feel frustration at your manager? This 
presupposes that you did, and while that may be likely, the question influences you. In fact, all questions 
are closed and all questions are leading, aren’t they?
As with all NLP, we do this all time – naturally and with random results. You might say to a colleague 
“you look nice today” and your colleague might think, “Did I look dreadful yesterday?” Someone may 
say to you “have you seen our new boss yet?” and you think, “We have another new boss?”
One thing that is important to understand about NLP is that the set of techniques that you’ll learn on 
a Practitioner course were created by analysing the work of therapists, therefore the techniques in their 
raw form work very well in a therapist’s practice room but not so well in a car showroom where they 
can come across as cheesy and insincere. My main area of innovation in NLP over the last 20 years has 
been to adapt NLP for use in a normal, everyday corporate environment. The flipchart swish is a good 
example of this. You already tear pages of flipcharts, so it’s not unusual. You don’t wave your hands in 
your learners’ faces and shout “whoosh!” at them, or ask them to relax, close their eyes, breathe deeply 
and imagine their troubles fading into the distance. However, the underlying structure of the swish, or 
the squash, or timeline, can be applied through any medium to produce a technique that is relevant and 
appropriate for the time and the place. It’s recognising how we influence people through our everyday 
actions and words and then fine tuning those actions and words to get better results that I believe is the 
value of NLP for the regular man, or woman, on the street.

What is NLP?
I heard a great story about children not going to the dentist early enough because their parents are 
scared to go. One mother overcame her fear to take her little girl who was naturally curious and open 
minded – with no preconceived ideas as to what would happen. As she sat in the chair, her mother said 
“don’t worry, it’s not going to hurt”. How do you think that little girl coped with that experience, given 
this new piece of information she’d never considered before?
If I say “it should be warm in here by now” then I presuppose that it’s cold. If I say “How will you feel 
when you realise you no longer have that bad habit” then in order to tell me how you’ll feel, you must 
accept that it’s possible to change.
When people have problems, they often operate within a restricted model of the world, in that they don’t 
seem to have access to resources and choices that would normally be available. Therefore, there’s no point 
trying to help someone with a problem when you’re working from your view of the world – you must 
work within theirs. This leads to a key principle of NLP – that people with problems are actually working 
perfectly and making the best choices they can, given their current understanding of their situation. This 
simple change in perspective leads to outstanding results when NLP is applied in therapy or coaching.
NLP stands for Neuro Linguistic Programming. That’s quite a complicated term for something that’s 
really quite simple – Neuro as in the function of the brain, Linguistic as in language and Programming 
as in the following of defined patterns and routines. Think about an activity you perform regularly 
without thinking about it, for example:
• shaking hands
• drinking a cup of coffee
• saying that little catchphrase you have
• driving a car
All of these activities are complex in terms of eye and muscle co-ordination, timing etc. Think of all the 
muscles you use just smiling at someone. You don’t need to think about moving all those muscles – you 
just decide to smile and it happens because somewhere in our brain there is a program, like a computer 
program, which contains all the commands to build a smile. That’s the programming part of NLP.
Talents that produce undesirable results are often called “phobias” and these too can be changed, quickly 
and effectively, using the NLP tool kit.
NLP is a mindset of curiosity that creates a set of tools and processes designed to bring about rapid and 
long lasting personal change. Some of these tools have found their way into other disciplines such as 
education, sales and public speaking.

NLP Training
27	 NLP Training
You can become a licensed Practitioner of NLP through many training companies now established in 
the UK and worldwide.
Some companies run their courses in theatres with hundreds of people, favouring the “you don’t need 
to ask any questions because you’re learning unconsciously” approach. Other companies work with 
very small groups with lots of interactivity. You just need to choose which suits you, because there are 
merits in both.
Many NLP training companies are introducing new levels of NLP training, including diplomas, 
certificates, Business Practitioners and even MSc courses. The fact is that there are only three levels as 
far as licensing is concerned – Practitioner, Master Practitioner and Trainer. Diplomas and certificates 
are usually at a foundation level and do not result in licensed certification. The MSc courses typically 
comprise some HR or management modules wrapped around a Practitioner course. Decide what you 
want to do with it before you sign up.

NLP Training
The three levels of licensed training are quite distinct in terms of the aims of the training. At Practitioner 
level, the key aim is to give you a personal experience of change. Before you start learning how to change 
other people, it’s very important that you have a personal reference for the way that people change and 
how the tools work. You will learn some basic change tools and by the end of the course you will have 
experienced some kind of personal change such as solving a problem or curing a phobia. At Master 
Practitioner level, you gain more insight into the structure and application of the tools so that you can 
create new tools yourself and refine the use of techniques such as hypnosis. At Trainer level, you will 
learn how to learn about NLP so that you can train others.
You don’t need any training at all to use NLP, but you’ll only get a license to practice if you complete 
the course. You need to decide for yourself if that’s important to you but I would say that the experience 
of Practitioner training is far more useful to you than the certificate will be, and it is totally different to 
just reading a book – even a good book like this!
Practitioner training is a very personal experience – even a journey – and therefore your relationship 
with the trainers and other delegates is the most important factor. You need to be working with people 
who you feel comfortable with to get the most out of the training.
Before signing up with any NLP training provider, first go to a free taster session or ask to attend a 
course for an hour before you make up your mind. Make sure you feel comfortable with the kind of 
people who attend that course, as this gives you a lot of information about where that trainer positions 
themselves in the market.
The next question to consider is which certificate to go for. The Society of NLP was set up by Dr Richard 
Bandler, co-creator of NLP. Early in 2004, the Association of NLP released a statement recognising 
Bandler and Grinder as the creators of NLP and therefore the best people to license Practitioners. The 
SNLP is now co-owned by Bandler, Christina Hall and a few others. As I write this, only Bandler and 
Hall can issue SNLP licenses. You also have the PGNLP, INLPTA and so on. The bottom line is this: don’t 
choose NLP training for the certificate – choose it for the most appropriate learning experience for you.
The fallout between the ANLP and the SNLP seems to have been over the training style necessary to 
learn NLP. SNLP courses tend to be shorter, ANLP longer. The ANLP people say you can’t learn NLP 
in 8 days, the SNLP people say that practise is more important than 20 days of theory. In my view, the 
course is the beginning of the learning process, not the end of it. 8 days or 20 days make no difference 
to this, only to the training style.

I’m a certified SNLP trainer, and the reason for this is that I personally think it’s worth having a certificate 
from the ‘original’ licensing body rather than one created as a second or third generation. For such a 
young subject, why not learn it first hand if you can? Whatever my personal opinions are about the 
creators and developers or NLP, I suggest you work with as many of them as you can so that you can 
get multiple perspectives on the subject. Keep an eye out for short courses and evening lectures if you 
don’t want to spend a fortune on training.
Finally and most importantly, the training courses are neither the beginning nor the end. The beginning 
must be an immense curiosity about people and about self improvement. There is no end, because you 
can learn something new from everyone you meet.

Bandler and Grinder’s first NLP book, “Frogs into Princes” was published.
When you attend a certified training program, you will need to sign a license agreement which ensures 
that you understand the rights and obligations of certification. You can request a copy of the agreement 
by emailing us at learn@nenlp.com, or via our publisher whose contact details are in the front of this 
book.
